OPTIONAL SURVEY

This optional survey is for purchasers of WarpLink 2.5 who wish
to be eligible for a free Practical Peripherals 9600 baud modem,
and -- if the Freelink package was received from a BBS -- to
make that BBS eligible for a $100.00 cash award.  It is also for
those purchasers who wish to have an automatic charitable
donation made to one of several charities.

Simply print out this portion of the file, answer the questions,
and mail it in to hyperkinetix with your order.  If you don't
mail in your order, you can still mail this survey.  One in
every 100 surveys will be selected for the modem and BBS award.
Every survey will contribute a charitable donation, if a
charity preference is marked.

First, let's answer a couple of a questions you may be have.
Why a survey?  These questions will help us determine which
areas to concentrate on for WarpLink development, and give us
useful statistics about WarpLink users.  Why the prizes?  To add
incentive and increase the number of you who will answer the
survey.  Simple as that.  Now, on with the survey.

Cash and modems will be sent within 30 days after expiration of
the 30-day money back guarantee time period.  Incomplete surveys
will be discarded.  Order amounts below a 100 boundary at the
expiration of the offer will be rounded down, except that there
will be at least one modem, and if applicable one BBS cash
amount, awarded regardless of the number of responses.  Bulletin
board systems can win more than one $100 cash award if selected
multiple times.  Early surveys will be included in more
drawings, so the sooner you send in the survey, the better your
odds of winning.

This promotion expires July 31, 1993.  Surveys received after
that date will not be entered into the modem drawing.
