The proposal of the project is to bring a practical experience to the student in the daily life of a network administrator. 
In addition, the possibility of enabling a routing protocol will allow the student an in-depth understanding of the working 
principle of the internet and how routers choose the best path from the network layer protocols, which is how computer networks actually work. 
deliver a connectivity service.


Details about the project:
  * Network topology using `Free Router`.
  * Static routing service for topology 1.
  * Dynamic routing service with the protocol (RIP - which implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm) for topology 2.
