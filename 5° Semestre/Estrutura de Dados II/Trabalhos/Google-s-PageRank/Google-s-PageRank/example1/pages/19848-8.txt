CHAPTER I
FIRST PRINCIPLES
We are often and rightly reminded that woman is half the human race It
is truer even than it appears Not only is woman half of the present
generation but present woman is half of all the generations of men and
women to come The argument of this book which will be regarded as
reactionary by many women called advancedpresumably as doctors say
that a case of consumption is advancedinvolves nothing other than
adequate recognition of the importance of woman in the most important of
all matters It is true that my primary concern has been to furnish for
the individual woman and for those in charge of girlhood a guide of
life based upon the known physiology of sex But it is a poor guide of
life which considers only the transient individual and poorest of all
in this very case
If it were true that woman is merely the vessel and custodian of the
future lives of men and women entrusted to her antenatal care by their
fathers as many creeds have supposed then indeed it would be a
question of relatively small moment how the mothers of the future were
chosen Our ingenious devices for ensuring the supremacy of man lend
colour to this idea We name children after their fathers and the fact
that they are also to some extent of the maternal stock is obscured
But when we ask to what extent they are also of maternal stock we find
that there is a rigorous equality between the sexes in this matter It
is a fact which has been ignored or inadequately recognized by every
feminist and by every eugenist from Plato until the present time
Salient qualities whether good or ill are more commonly displayed by
men than by women Great strength or physical courage or endurance
great ability or genius together with a variety of abnormalities are
much more commonly found in men than in women and the eugenic emphasis
has therefore always been laid upon the choice of fathers rather than of
mothers Not so long ago the scion of a noble race must marry not at
all necessarily the daughter of another noble race but rather any young
healthy woman who promised to be able to bear children easily and suckle
them long But directly we observe under the microscope the facts of
development we discover that each parent contributes an exactly equal
share to the making of the new individual and all the ancient and
modern ideas of the superior value of wellselected fatherhood fall to
the ground Woman is indeed half the race In virtue of expectant
motherhood and her antenatal nurture of us all she might well claim
to be more but she is half at least
And thus it matters for the future at least as much how the mothers are
chosen as how the fathers are This remains true notwithstanding that
the differences between men commending them for selection or rejection
seem so much more conspicuous and important than in the case of women
For in the first place the differences between women are much greater
than appear when for instance we read history as history is at present
understood or when we observe and compare the world and his wife
Uniformity or comparative uniformity of environment is a factor of
obvious importance in tending to repress the natural differences between
women Reverse the occupations and surroundings of the sexes and it
