recognised he added the central stone cupola of the National Gallery
appearing over all like a hastily bestowed blessing but covered the
remaining space upon his canvas with imaginary stalls of glowing
flowers and even more imaginary flowersellers  His picture was
greatly admired and very much resembled the Market Square in Havre
upon a Monday morning
A Spanish artist chancing to pass the same way likewise hastily
completed a picture of Trafalgar Square as he wished to see it adding
by way of a decorative effect a latticework of trellised vines like
unto his beloved vineyards of Andalusia  Dwarf oranges grew in
profusion and hung their coloured golden globes over the squat stone
walls  A brilliant Southern sun beat upon both baking the walls
redhot and ripening the oranges at one and the same time  This
picture the artist named Trafalgar Square when the Sun Shines
A Cubist painter not to be outdone with regard to his point of view of
such a subject covered an immense canvas with wonderful heaving
squares of ochre and green viewed from a background suggesting endless
mud  This suggestion however may have been in the nature of a small
tribute to the usual condition of the London streets  This production
which the Cubist artist was optimistic enough to name simply Trafalgar
Square was instantly bought by a famous geologist who to this day
indulges in the beautiful belief that he possesses the only indication
of what this particular portion of the world was like before ever the
earth was made
Last of all arrived a Futurist painter who painted everything in
Trafalgar Square and nothing that did not appear in it  The
painter however selected a really wonderful aspect of the Square
seen from a most strange angle a sort of birdseye view of it which
could only have been obtained from a balloon  So remarkable was the
perspective that the entire Square as seen in the picture appeared as
if it were being gradually drawn sideways up to Heaven  The great
Nelson column and all the four lions could be viewed simultaneously
and the artist had painted all the four lions alike
Now a Writer whose chambers overlooked Trafalgar Square and who was
acquainted with its every aspect by night as well as day knew full
well that the Futurist artist was wrong when he painted all the four
lions alike  The Writer knew that one Lion was totally different
from all the others so the Writer smiled and kept his own counsel
I will wait said the Writer until somebody else has made the same
discovery that I have made  I will remain completely silent concerning
one square patch of fairyland placed within the very hub and centre of
the Universe within the busiest part of a great city  When some other
traveller finds the key to the mystic place we shall both discover it
is possible to talk about something which nobody else understands and
be enabled to compare notes
