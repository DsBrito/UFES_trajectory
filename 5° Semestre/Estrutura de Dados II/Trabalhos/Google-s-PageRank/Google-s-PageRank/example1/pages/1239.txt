once roamed in his insatiate pursuit of savages and renegades and
who was purely a product of the times Civilization could not have
brought forth a man like Wetzel Great revolutions great crises
great moments come and produce the men to deal with them
The border needed Wetzel The settlers would have needed many more
years in which to make permanent homes had it not been for him He
was never a pioneer but always a hunter after Indians When not on
the track of the savage foe he was in the settlement with his keen
eye and ear ever alert for signs of the enemy To the superstitious
Indians he was a shadow a spirit of the border which breathed
menace from the dark forests To the settlers he was the right arm
of defense a fitting leader for those few implacable and unerring
frontiersmen who made the settlement of the West a possibility
And if this story of one of his relentless pursuits shows the man as
he truly was loved by pioneers respected and feared by redmen and
hated by renegades if it softens a little the ruthless name history
accords him the writer will have been well repaid

character It checked his boldness as nothing else had done
Suddenly there came to him the real meaning of a womans love when
she bestows it without reservation Silenced by the thought that he
had not understood her at all and the knowledge that he had been
half in sport he gazed out over the wild country before them
The scene impressed its quietness upon the young couple and brought
more forcibly to their minds the fact that they were at the gateway
of the unknown West that somewhere beyond this rude frontier
settlement out there in those unbroken forests stretching dark and
silent before them was to be their future home
From the high bank where they stood the land sloped and narrowed
gradually until it ended in a sharp point which marked the last bit
of land between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers Here these
swift streams merged and formed the broad Ohio The newborn river
even here at its beginning proud and swelling as if already certain
of its faraway grandeur swept majestically round a wide curve and
apparently lost itself in the forest foliage
On the narrow point of land commanding a view of the rivers stood a
long low structure enclosed by a stockade fence on the four
corners of which were little boxshaped houses that bulged out as if
trying to see what was going on beneath The massive timbers used in
