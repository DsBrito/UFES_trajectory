execution of our undertaking we decided to invite the collaboration
of many scholars and specialists each of whom could out of the
fullness of information speak with authority on some particular
phase of the general subject We are glad to say that the eminent
writers to whom we addressed ourselves answered with promptitude and
alacrity to our call and have supplied us with such a body of
material as to enable us to bring out a book that is absolutely
unique
From each contributor we asked nothing but a plain verifiable
statement of facts and that we think is exactly what they have
given us for while we do not make ourselves personally responsible
for everything set down in the following pages we believe that what
stands written therein bears every mark of careful research and of
absolute reliability
Although on many of our subjects little more remains to be said than
what appears in the text yet the treatment on the whole does not
claim to be exhaustive and therefore each writer has at our
request appended to his contribution a short and carefully selected
bibliography so that those who are interested may have a guide for
further reading For our part we consider these lists of works of
reference to be a highly useful feature
It is a glorious thing for us who are proud one of us of his Irish
descent and the other of his Irish birth to think that the sons and
daughters of mother Erin have so conspicuously distinguished
themselves in such varied spheres of activity in every age and in so
many lands and that we were privileged to make public the record of
their achievements in a form never before attempted
We have other works in contemplation and some actually in
preparation which will go far to strengthen the claims put forward
in this book In the meantime we trust that the reception accorded
to it will be such as to encourage us to persevere in making still
better known the Glories of Ireland
