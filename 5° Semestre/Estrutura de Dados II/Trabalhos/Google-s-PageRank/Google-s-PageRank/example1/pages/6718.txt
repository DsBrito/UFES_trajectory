Dont know as I ever saw a finer observed Daniel Off on a cruise
somewhere I presume likely hey
Picnic down at the Point
Well youve got picnic weather all right Yes sir you have
Comment concerning the weather is the inevitable preliminary to all
commercial transactions in Trumet Now preliminaries being over Daniel
waited hopefully for what was to follow His hopes were dashed
Isis Miss Dott about inquired one of the callers
Miss Dott Oh Gertie No she aint Shes gone down street
somewheres Be back pretty soon I shouldnt wonder
Humph Well Im afraid we cant wait We hoped she might go with us on
the picnic Weerwe wanted her very much
That so Im sorry but Im afraid she couldnt go even if she was
here You see its her last day at home andweher mother and
Ithat is I dont believe shed want to leave us today
No no of course not Well tell her we wish she might have come
but we understand Yes yes in answer to the calls from the barge
were coming Well good by Captain Dott
Ergood by Ererdont want anything to take along do you A nice
box of candy oror anything

with candy enough to last a week Good morning

Good by
The barge moved off Daniel standing dejectedly in the door
remembered his manners
Hope you have a nice time he shouted Then he turned and moved
disconsolately back to the desk He might have expected it It was thus
in nine cases out of ten The Emporium Mr J Cohen proprietor was
his undoing in this instance as in so many others The Emporium got the
trade and he got the good bys Mr Cohen was not an old resident as
he was Mr Cohens daughter was not invited to picnics by the summer
people Mrs Cohen was not head of the sewing circle and the Chapter of
the Ladies of Honor and prominent socially as was Mrs Dott but Mr
Cohen bought cheap and sold cheap and the Emporium flourished like a
green bay tree while the Metropolitan Store was rapidly going to seed
Daniel looking out through the front window at the blue sea in the
distance thought of the past of the days when as commander and
part owner of the three masted schooner Bluebird he had been free and
prosperous and happy Then he considered the future which was bluer
than the sea and sighed again Why had he not been content to stick
to the profession he understood to remain on the salt water he loved
instead of retiring from the sea to live on dry land and squander his
small fortune in a business for which he was entirely unfitted
And yet the answer was simple enough Mrs DottMrs Serena Dott his
wifewas the answer she and her social aspirations It was Serena
who had coaxed him into giving up seafaring who had said that it was
a shame for him to waste his life ordering foremast hands about when he
might be one of the leading citizens in his native town It was Serena
