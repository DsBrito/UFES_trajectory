the earth the elect of society represented by that little great world
which lies between the narrow circle bounded by Bryanstone Square on the
north and by Birdcage Walk on the south did not consider seven oclock
too early an hour for a dinner party which was to be followed by routs
drums concerts conversazione as the case might be It was seven
oclock on a lovely June evening and the Park was already deserted and
carriages were rolling swiftly along all the Westend squares carrying
rank fashion wealth and beauty political influence and intellectual
power to the particular circle in which each was destined to illumine
upon that particular evening
Stateliest among London squares Grosvenorin some wise a wonder to the
universe as newly lighted with gasgrave Grosvenor with its heavy old
Georgian houses and pompous porticoes sparkled and shone not alone
with the novel splendour of gas but with the light of many wax candles
clustering flowerlike in silver branches and girandoles multiplying
their flame in numerous mirrors and of all the houses in that stately
square none had a more imposing aspect than Lord Denyers dark red brick
mansion with stone dressings and the massive grandeur of an Egyptian
mausoleum
Lord Denyer was an important personage in the political and diplomatic
world He had been ambassador at Constantinople and at Paris and had
now retired on his laurels an influence still but no longer an active
power in the machine of government At his house gathered all that was
most brilliant in London society To be seen at Lady Denyers evening
parties was the guinea stamp of social distinction to dine with Lord
Denyer was an opening in life almost as valuable as University honours
and more difficult of attainment
It was during the quarter of an hour before dinner that a group of
persons mostly personages congregated round Lord Denyers
chimneypiece naturally trending towards the social hearth albeit it
was the season for roses and lilies rather than of fires and the hum of
the city was floating in upon the breath of the warm June evening
through the five tall windows which opened upon Lord Denyers balcony
The ten or twelve persons assembled seemed only a sprinkling in the large
lofty room furnished sparsely with amber satin sofas a pair of Florentine
marble tables and half an acre or so of looking glass Voluminous amber
draperies shrouded the windows and deadened the sound of rolling wheels
and the voices and footfalls of western London The drawing rooms of those
days were neither artistic nor picturesqueneither Early English nor Low
Dutch nor Renaissance nor AngloJapanese A stately commonplace
distinguished the reception rooms of the great world Upholstery stagnated
at a dead level of fluted legs gilding plate glass and amber satin
Lady Denyer stood a little way in advance of the group on the hearthrug
fanning herself with her eye on the door while she listened languidly
to the remarks of a youthful diplomatist a sprig of a lordly tree upon
the last debut at Her Majestys Theatre
My own idea was that she screamed said her ladyship But the new
Rosinas generally do scream Why do we have a new Rosina every year
whom nobody ever hears of afterwards What becomes of them Do they die
or do they set up as singing mistresses in secondrate wateringplaces
