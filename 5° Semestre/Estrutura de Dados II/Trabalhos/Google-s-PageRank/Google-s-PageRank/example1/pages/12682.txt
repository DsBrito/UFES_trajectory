gathered in front of the palace rather than before the Chamber of
Deputies
You forget that the premier is closeted with the king returned Hal
In all probability the first word of a definite step will emanate from
the palace though unofficially of course
I see said Chester Welllook there Hal
Whats the matter demanded the latter eying his companion in
some surprise
Chester seized his friends arm with one hand and with the other pointed
directly ahead Hal gazed in the direction indicated He saw at once what
had caused Chesters sudden exclamation
Not five yards away right in the center of the dense crowd but still in
view of the two boys stood an Italian army officer in full uniform He
was gazing straight ahead toward the palace steps paying no heed to
those who pushed and jostled him He stood erect with arms folded upon
his breast
Even as the two boys looked an arm came from behind him and reaching
across his shoulder a hand crept cautiously into the pocket of the
officers military cloak which he had thrown open because of its warmth
Hal uttered a low exclamation and was about to step forward when there
came a sudden shout from the crowd which surged in about him cutting
off his view of the Italian officer For a single instant Hal turned his
eyes toward the palace and there took one look at a second uniformed
figure who stood upon the top step and waved his arms about violently
I guess war has come the boy muttered to himself as he took a step
forward and elbowed his way toward the spot where the other Italian
officer stood
Chester came close behind his friend
By dint of hard pushing and shoving which drew ugly remarks from some of
the bystanders upon whose feet they trod the boys at last came to the
spot they sought They had made good time and the invisible owner of the
hand that had explored the officers pocket was just withdrawing it And

He uttered a cry and dashed forward in spite of the crowd At almost the
same moment the officer came to life Instinct must have warned him that
there was something wrong He clapped his hand to his pocket and then
uttered a fierce ejaculation in his native tongue
He wheeled about with a cry and his arm shot out There was a struggle
and then the officer fell to the ground A blow from his adversarys fist
had laid him low Hal who was a few leaps ahead of Chester reached out
to seize the man who he could see still held the bit of white paper in
his hand but the other was too quick for him
With a sudden backward leap he was among the crowd which apparently
had failed to grasp the significance of the trouble Hal uttered a quick
cry to Chester and also dashed into the crowd Chester followed him
Ahead but almost hidden by others of the crowd which pressed forward
the better to see what was going on upon the palace steps Hal could see
his quarry squirming his way through the dense mass of humanity
Stop him he cried raising his voice to a shout
The crowd paid no heed The people were too wrapped up in what was going
