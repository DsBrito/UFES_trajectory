I have not attempted to be profound or mystical or even scientific but
I have tried to present clearly simply and as nearly without bias as
possible an account of what I have seen and heard The weight of
evidence seems at the moment to be on the side of the biologists but
I am willing to reopen the case at any time although I am above all
a man of the open air of the plains and the mountains and do not
intend to identify myself with any branch of metapsychical research It
is probable therefore that this is my one and final contribution to
the study of the shadow world

CHICAGO July 1908
THE SHADOW WORLD
I
A hush fell over the dinnertable and every ear was open and inclined
as Cameron the host continued No I wouldnt say that There are
some things that are pretty well establishedtelepathy for instance
I dont believe even in telepathy asserted Mrs Quigg a very
positive journalist who sat at his right I think even that is mere
coincidence
Several voices rose in a chorus of protest Oh no Telepathy is real
Why Ive had experiences
There you go replied Mrs Quigg still in the heat of her opposition
You will all tell the same story Your friend was dying in Bombay or
Vienna and his spirit appeared to you a la Journal of Psychic
Research with a message at the exact hour computing difference in
time which no one ever does and so on I know that kind of thingbut
that isnt telepathy
What is telepathy then asked little Miss Brush who paints
miniatures
I cant describe a thing that doesnt exist replied Mrs Quigg The
word means feeling at a distance does it not professor
Harris a teacher of English who seldom took a serious view of
anything answered I should call it a longdistance touch
Do you believe in hypnotism Dr Miller asked Miss Brush quietly
addressing her neighbor a young scientist whose specialty was
chemistry
No replied he I dont believe in a single one of these supernatural
forces
You mean you dont believe in anything you have not seen yourself
said I
To this Miller slowly replied I believe in Vienna which I have never
seen but I dont believe in a Vienna doctor who claims to be able to
hypnotize a man so that he can smile while his leg is being taken off
Oh thats a fact stated Brierly the portraitpainter that happens
every day in our hospitals here in New York City
Have you ever seen it done asked Miller bristling with opposition
No
Well asserted Miller I wouldnt believe it even if I saw the
operation performed
You dont believe in any mystery unless it is familiar said I
