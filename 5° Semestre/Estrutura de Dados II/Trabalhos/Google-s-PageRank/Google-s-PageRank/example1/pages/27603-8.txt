INTRODUCTION
The Red True Story Book needs no long Introduction The Editor in
presenting The Blue True Story Book apologised for offering tales so
much less thrilling and romantic than the legends of the Fairies but he
added that even real facts were sometimes curious and interesting
Next year he promises something quite as true as History and quite as
entertaining as Fairies
For this book Mr Rider Haggard has kindly prepared a narrative of
Wilsons Last Fight by aid of conversations with Mr Burnham the
gallant American scout But Mr Haggard found while writing his
chapter that Mr Burnham had already told the story in an Interview
published by the Westminster Gazette The courtesy of the proprietor
of that journal and of Mr Burnham has permitted Mr Haggard to
incorporate the already printed narrative with his own matter
The Life and Death of Joan the Maid is by the Editor who has used M
Quicherats Proces five volumes published for the Historical Society
