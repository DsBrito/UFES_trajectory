generously wafted inland to Quillcote
Mrs Wiggin is thoroughly in love with this big rambling house from
garret to cellar  A genuine historic air seems to surround the entire
place lending an added charm and there are many impressive
characteristics of the house in its dignity of architecture which seem
to speak of a past century with volumes of history in reserve  A few
steps from these ample grounds on the opposite side of the road is a
pretty wooden cottage of moderate size and very attractive the early
home of Mrs Wiggin  These scenes have inspired much of the local
coloring of her stories of New England life and character  Pleasant
River in Timothys Quest is drawn from this locality and in her
latest book The Village Watch Tower many of her settings and
descriptions are very close to existing conditions
Her own room and literary workshop is on the second floor of the house
it is distinctively a study in white and no place could be more ideal
for creative work  It has the cheeriest outlook from four windows with
a southern exposure overlooking a broad grass plat studded with trees
where birds from early dawn hold merry carnival and squirrels find
perfect and unmolested freedom  A peep into this sanctum is a most
convincing proof that she is a woman who dearly loves order as every
detail plainly indicates and it is also noticeable that any display of
literary litter is most conspicuously absent
Interesting souvenirs and gifts of infinite variety are scattered all
over the room on the wainscoting mantel and in every available
niche very many are from children and all are dainty tributes  A
picture of an irresistibly droll child face of the African type and
infectiously full of mirth is one of a great company of children who
look at you from every side and angle of the room
Dainty old pieces of china rare bits of bricabrac the very broad
and oldtime fireplaces filled with cut boughs of the spicy fir balsam
and various antique pieces of furniture lend to the inner atmosphere of
Quillcote a fine artistic and colonial effect while not a stones
throw away at the foot of a precipitous bank flowsin a very
irregular channelthe picturesque Saco River
In this summer home Mrs Wiggin has the companionship of her mother
and her sister Miss Nora Smith herself a writer which renders it
easy to abandon herself wholly to her creative work this coupled with
the fact that she is practically in seclusion banishes even a thought
of interruption
And now what was the beginning and the growth of the delightful
literary faculty which has already given birth to so many pleasant
fancies and happy studies especially of young life  A glimpse is
given in the following playful letter and postscript from herself and
her sister to a wouldbe biographer
MY DEAR BOSWELLI have asked my family for some incidents of my
childhood as you bade mesoliciting any anecdotes
characteristics or early tendencies that may have been as you
suggest foreshadowings of later things
I have been much chagrined at the result  My younger sister states
that I was a nice wellmannered capable child nothing more and that
