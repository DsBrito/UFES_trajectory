I sometimes think theres never such Tirade
As where some Bridge Game has been badly Played
When Some One thinks you should have made no Trump
And you have thriftily declared a Spade
Illustration
Myself when Young did eagerly Frequent
Bridge Tournaments and heard Great Argument
About this Point and That Yet after all
Came out no Better Player than I went
Illustration
For I remember stopping by the Way
To watch Four Celebrated Champions play
They Differed on the Discard Make and Lead
Whatever One SaidSaid The Others Nay
Illustration
Why if a Soul can fling the Rules aside
And let his CardSense be his Only Guide
Weret not a Shame weret not a Shame for him
By Street and Elwell tamely to abide
Illustration
And if the Card you hopefully Finesse
Capture the Trickyour Partner Smiles Oh yes
And you smile Broadly But if it be Caught
By the Fourth Handyour Smiles are somewhat Less
Illustration
But if in Vain down on the Stubborn Score
You gaze and make it No Trumps just once more
With Strength in Every Suit but with No Ace
How thenwhen Dummy calmly Lays down Four
Illustration
To Them the Heart Convention did I show
And with Mine Own Hand tried to make it go
But this is all the Wisdom that I reaped
With more than Three Hearts always lead the Low
Illustration
For Trump or NoTrump though with all the Rules
Of different Masters and of different Schools
Ive played with Players of all Sortsbut I
Have never beaten anythingbut Fools
Illustration
Indeed indeedto Quit It oft Before
I sworebut did I mean it when I swore
And thenand then came Three and Cards in Hand
I Joined them and they made me keep the Score
Illustration
Alas how Subtle Bridge alluring Woos
And robs me of my Nightly BeautySnooze
I often Wonder what Bridge Players gain
Onehalf so Precious as the Sleep they Lose
