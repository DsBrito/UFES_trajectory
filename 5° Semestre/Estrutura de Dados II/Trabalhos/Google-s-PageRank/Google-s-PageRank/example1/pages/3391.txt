However it was he instantly lost all fear when they met at the station
and Harte pressed forward with his cordial handclasp as if he were not
even a fairy prince and with that voice and laugh which were surely the
most winning in the world He was then as always a child of extreme
fashion as to his clothes and the cut of his beard which he wore in a
mustache and the drooping sidewhiskers of the day and his jovial
physiognomy was as winning as his voice with its straight nose and
fascinating thrust of the under lip its fine eyes and good forehead
then thickly crowned with the black hair which grew early white while
his mustache remained dark the most enviable and consoling effect
possible in the universal mortal necessity of either aging or dying He
was as one could not help seeing thickly pitted but after the first
glance one forgot this so that a lady who met him for the first time
could say to him Mr Harte arent you afraid to go about in the cars
so recklessly when there is this scare about smallpox No madam he

The drive out from Boston was not too long for getting on terms of
personal friendship with the family which just filled the hack the two

every day being born in California and must begin to feel it home from
the first breath but it is notable that none of the Californians of that
great early day have gone back to live amid the scenes which inspired and
prospered them
Before they came in sight of the editors humble roof he had mocked
himself to his guest for his trepidations and Harte with burlesque
magnanimity had consented to be for that occasion only something less
formidable than he had loomed afar He accepted with joy the theory of
passing a week in the home of virtuous poverty and the week began as
delightfully as it went on From first to last Cambridge amused him as
much as it charmed him by that air of academic distinction which was
stranger to him even than the refined trees and grass It has already
been told how after a list of the local celebrities had been recited to
him he said why you couldnt stand on your front porch and fire off
your revolver without bringing down a two volumer and no doubt the
