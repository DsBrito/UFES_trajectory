a growing or perhaps one should say an established conviction that the
pupils enjoyment of what he reads ought to be the chief consideration
in the work From such enjoyment it is conceded come the knowledge and
the power that are the end of study All profitable literature work in
the secondary grades must be based upon the unforced attention and
activity of the student
An inevitable phase of this liberal attitude is a readiness to promote
the study of modern authors It is now the generally accepted view that
many pieces of recent literature are more suitable for young peoples
reading than the old and conventionally approved classics This is not
to say that the really readable classics should be discarded since they
have their own place and their own value Yet it is everywhere admitted
that modern literature should be given its opportunity to appeal to high
school students and that at some stage in their course it should
receive its due share of recognition The mere fact that modern writers
are in point of material and style less remote than the classic
authors from the immediate interests of the students is sufficient to
recommend them Then too since young people are in the nature of
things constantly brought into contact with some form of modern
literature they need to be provided with a standard of criticism and
choice
The present volume is an attempt to assemble in a convenient manner a
number of selections from recent literature such as high school
students of average taste and ability may understand and enjoy These
selections are not all equally difficult Some need to be read rapidly
for their intrinsic interest others deserve more analysis of form and
content still others demand careful intensive study This diversity of
method is almost a necessity in a full years course in reading in
which rigidity and monotony ought above all things to be avoided
Although convinced that the larger part of the reading work in the high
school years should be devoted to the study of prose the editor has
here included what she believes to be a just proportion of poetry The
poems have been chosen with a view to the fact that they are varied in
form and sentiment and that they exhibit in no small degree the
tendencies of modern poetic thought with its love of nature and its
humanitarian impulses
An attempt has been made to present examples of the most usual and
readable forms of prose compositionnarration the account of travel
the personal essay and serious exposition The authors of these
selections possess without exception that distinction of style which
entitles them to a high rank in literature and makes them inspiring
models for the unskilled writer
A word may be said as to the intention of the study helps and lists of
readings The object of this equipment is to conserve the energies of
the teacher and direct the activities of the student It is by no means
expected that any one class will be able to make use of all the material
provided yet it is hoped that a considerable amount may prove
available to every group that has access to the text
The study questions serve to concentrate the reading of the students in
order to prevent that aimless wandering of eye and mind which with many
