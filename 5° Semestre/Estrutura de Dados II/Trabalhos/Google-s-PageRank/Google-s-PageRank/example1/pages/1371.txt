business intent upon the main object of the enterprise and but little
versed in science or curious about matters not immediately bearing upon
their interest and as they were written often in moments of fatigue
or hurry amid the inconveniences of wild encampments they were
often meagre in their details furnishing hints to provoke rather
than narratives to satisfy inquiry I have therefore availed myself
occasionally of collateral lights supplied by the published journals of
other travellers who have visited the scenes described such as Messrs
Lewis and Clarke Bradbury Breckenridge Long Franchere and Ross Cox
and make a general acknowledgment of aid received from these quarters
The work I here present to the public is necessarily of a rambling
and somewhat disjointed nature comprising various expeditions and
adventures by land and sea The facts however will prove to be linked
and banded together by one grand scheme devised and conducted by
a master spirit one set of characters also continues throughout
appearing occasionally though sometimes at long intervals and the
whole enterprise winds up by a regular catastrophe so that the work
without any labored attempt at artificial construction actually
possesses much of that unity so much sought after in works of fiction
and considered so important to the interest of every history

TWO leading objects of commercial gain have given birth to wide and
daring enterprise in the early history of the Americas the precious
metals of the South and the rich peltries of the North While the fiery
and magnificent Spaniard inflamed with the mania for gold has extended
his discoveries and conquests over those brilliant countries scorched by
the ardent sun of the tropics the adroit and buoyant Frenchman and the
cool and calculating Briton have pursued the less splendid but no
less lucrative traffic in furs amidst the hyperborean regions of the
Canadas until they have advanced even within the Arctic Circle
These two pursuits have thus in a manner been the pioneers and
precursors of civilization Without pausing on the borders they have
penetrated at once in defiance of difficulties and dangers to the
heart of savage countries laying open the hidden secrets of the
wilderness leading the way to remote regions of beauty and fertility
