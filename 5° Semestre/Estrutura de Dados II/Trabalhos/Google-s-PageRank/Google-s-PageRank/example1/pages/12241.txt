Who own the ample sea
Or brooches when the Emperor
With rubies pelteth me
Or gold who am the Prince of Mines
Or diamonds when I see
A diadem to fit a dome
Continual crowning me
II
SUPERIORITY TO FATE
Superiority to fate
Is difficult to learn
T is not conferred by any
But possible to earn
A pittance at a time
Until to her surprise
The soul with strict economy
Subsists till Paradise
III
HOPE
Hope is a subtle glutton
He feeds upon the fair
And yet inspected closely
What abstinence is there
His is the halcyon table
That never seats but one
And whatsoever is consumed
The same amounts remain
IV
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
I
Forbidden fruit a flavor has
That lawful orchards mocks
How luscious lies the pea within
The pod that Duty locks
V
FORBIDDEN FRUIT
II
Heaven is what I cannot reach
The apple on the tree
Provided it do hopeless hang
That heaven is to me
The color on the cruising cloud
The interdicted ground
Behind the hill the house behind
There Paradise is found
VI
A WORD
A word is dead
When it is said
Some say
