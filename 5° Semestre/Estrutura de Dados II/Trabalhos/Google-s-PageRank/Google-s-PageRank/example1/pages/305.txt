course of a month
She was evidently incensed and the new footman seemed to share her
indignation Why how is it he exclaimed Is the count an owl A
man whos not yet fifty years old and whos said to be worth several
millions
Yes millions you may safely say itand perhaps ten perhaps twenty
millions too
Then all the more reason why there should be something going on here
What does he do with himself alone all the blessed day
Nothing He reads in the library or wanders about the garden
