ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF FORM AND ORNAMENT
IN CERAMIC ART
BY WILLIAM H HOLMES
INTRODUCTORY
For the investigation of art in its early stages and in its widest
sensethere is probably no fairer field than that afforded by
aboriginal America ancient and modern
At the period of discovery art at a number of places on the American
continent seems to have been developing surely and steadily through the
force of the innate genius of the race and the more advanced nations
were already approaching the threshold of civilization at the same time
their methods were characterized by great simplicity and their art
products are as a consequence exceptionally homogeneous
The advent of European civilization checked the current of growth and
new and conflicting elements were introduced necessarily disastrous to
the native development
There is much however in the art of living tribes especially of those
least influenced by the whites capable of throwing light upon the
obscure passages of precolumbian art By supplementing the study of the
prehistoric by that of historic art which is still in many cases in its
incipient stages we may hope to penetrate deeply into the secrets of
the past
The advantages of this field as compared with Greece Egypt and the
Orient will be apparent when we remember that the dawn of art in these
countries lies hidden in the shadow of unnumbered ages while ours
stands out in the light of the very present This is well illustrated by
a remark of Birch who in dwelling upon the antiquity of the fictile
art says that the existence of earthen vessels in Egypt was at least
coeval with the formation of a written language1 Beyond this there
is acknowledged chaos In strong contrast with this is the fact that
all precolumbian American pottery precedes the acquisition of written
language and this contrast is emphasized by the additional fact that it
also antedates the use of the wheel that great perverter of the plastic
tendencies of clay

The material presented in the following notes is derived chiefly from
the native ceramic art of the United States but the principles involved
are applicable to all times and to all art as they are based upon the
laws of nature
Ceramic art presents two classes of phenomena of importance in the study
of the evolution of sthetic culture These relate first to form
and second to ornament
Form as embodied in clay vessels embraces 1st useful shapes
which may or may not be ornamental and 2d sthetic shapes which
are ornamental and may be useful There are also grotesque and
