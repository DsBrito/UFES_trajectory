the Oro  It seemed to hold in its motionless bosom the very spirit of
silence and death  The delicately traced pattern of a rabbit or weasel
track and a narrow human pathway that wound tortuously into the
sepulchral depths were the only signs of life in all the white
stillness  Away down the dim cathedrallike aisles that fainted into
softest grey in the distance the crackling of an overburdened twig
rang startlingly clear in the awesome hush  The tall firs and pines
swept the white earth with their snowladen branches the drooping
limbs looking like throngs of cowled heads bent to worship in the
sacred stillness of a vast temple  For the forest was indeed a place
in which to wonder and to pray a place all white and holy filled with
the mystery and awe of death
But suddenly into this softly curtained sanctuary came a profaning
sound a clear joyous shout rang through the sacred aisles and down
the narrow pathway leaping over fallen logs whipping aside the laden
branches and scattering their snowcrowns in a whirling mist about him
destroying in his ruthless progress both the sanctity and the beauty
of the place came a human figure a little figure straight and
sturdy and as lithe and active as any other wild forestcreature
His small redmittened hands the scarlet woollen scarf about his
neck and his rosy cheeks made a bold dash of colour in the sombre
gloom as his abounding life disturbed the winter deathsleep
On he came leaping from log to log like a hare and setting the
stately forest arches ringing to a rollicking Scottish song tuneful
and incongruous
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
Well up an gie them a blaw a blaw
Wi a hundred pipers an a an a
But as he plunged down the hill into the grey depths he suddenly ceased
singing  The awe of the place touched his childs spirit  Reared in
the forest though he had been he suddenly felt strangely unfamiliar
with his surroundings  He had never before experienced anything like
fear in the woods  The rigours of seven Canadian winters had bred a
hardy spirit in this little backwoodsman and besides what was there to
dread in the forest  It had been his playground ever since he was
first able to steal away from Granny and toddle off to the bush to
gather blue flags and poke up the goggleeyed frogs from their fragrant
muskpools  But here was something unfamiliar a strange uncanny place
the swamp seemed today and being Natures intimate he fell into
sudden sympathy with her awestricken mood
He sped silently forward glancing fearfully down the dim shadowy
aisles so ghostly so mysterious dreading he knew not what
Eh eh it will be a fearsome place he whispered  Its jisteh
it must be the valley of the shadow  And then he suddenly
remembered the psalm that Granny had taught him as soon as he could
speak
Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I will fear no evil for Thou art with me
He whispered it over from beginning to end not because he comprehended
