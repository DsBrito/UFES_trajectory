The Forum The North American Review The Smart Set and The
Bookman I am indebted for permission to republish such materials as I
have culled from my contributions to their pages Though these papers were
written at different times and for different immediate circles of
subscribers they were all designed from the outset to illustrate certain
steady central principles of dramatic criticism and thus collected they
afford I think a consistent exposition of the most important points in

Play has not in any form appeared in print before and all the other
papers have been diligently revised and in many passages entirely
rewritten
