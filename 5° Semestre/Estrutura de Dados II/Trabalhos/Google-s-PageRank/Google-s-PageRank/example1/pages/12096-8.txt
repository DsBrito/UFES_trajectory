About ten years ago while spending a few days under the hospitable roof
of the distinguished Belgian jurist the lamented M de Laveleye our
conversation turned during one of our rambles to the subject of
religion Do you mean to say asked the venerable professor that you
have no religious instruction in your schools On my replying in the
negative he suddenly halted in astonishment and in a voice which I
shall not easily forget he repeated No religion How do you impart
moral education The question stunned me at the time I could give no
ready answer for the moral precepts I learned in my childhood days
were not given in schools and not until I began to analyze the
different elements that formed my notions of right and wrong did I find
that it was Bushido that breathed them into my nostrils
The direct inception of this little book is due to the frequent queries
put by my wife as to the reasons why such and such ideas and customs
prevail in Japan
In my attempts to give satisfactory replies to M de Laveleye and to my
wife I found that without understanding Feudalism and Bushido1 the
moral ideas of present Japan are a sealed volume
Footnote 1 Pronounced Boosheedoh In putting Japanese words and
names into English Hepburns rule is followed that the vowels should
be used as in European languages and the consonants as in English
Taking advantage of enforced idleness on account of long illness I put
down in the order now presented to the public some of the answers given
in our household conversation They consist mainly of what I was taught
and told in my youthful days when Feudalism was still in force
Between Lafcadio Hearn and Mrs Hugh Fraser on one side and Sir Ernest
Satow and Professor Chamberlain on the other it is indeed discouraging
to write anything Japanese in English The only advantage I have over
them is that I can assume the attitude of a personal defendant while
these distinguished writers are at best solicitors and attorneys I
have often thoughtHad I their gift of language I would present the
cause of Japan in more eloquent terms But one who speaks in a borrowed
tongue should be thankful if he can just make himself intelligible
All through the discourse I have tried to illustrate whatever points I
have made with parallel examples from European history and literature
believing that these will aid in bringing the subject nearer to the
comprehension of foreign readers
Should any of my allusions to religious subjects and to religious
workers be thought slighting I trust my attitude towards Christianity
itself will not be questioned It is with ecclesiastical methods and
with the forms which obscure the teachings of Christ and not with the
teachings themselves that I have little sympathy I believe in the
religion taught by Him and handed down to us in the New Testament as
well as in the law written in the heart Further I believe that God
hath made a testament which maybe called old with every people and
nationGentile or Jew Christian or Heathen As to the rest of my
theology I need not impose upon the patience of the public
In concluding this preface I wish to express my thanks to my friend
Anna C Hartshorne for many valuable suggestions and for the
characteristically Japanese design made by her for the cover of this
