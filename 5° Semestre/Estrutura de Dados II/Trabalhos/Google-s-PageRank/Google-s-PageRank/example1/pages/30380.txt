Henry go out to the fields the woman said
No Henry said standing stretching his thin hard body I wont go
out to the fields Neither will August Brown nor Clyde Briggs nor Alfred
Swanson None of us Anywhere Not until the foods been stopped long
enough for people to wake up
The farmer looked out of the kitchen window beyond his tractor and the
cow barn and the windmill He looked at rows of strong corn shivering
their soft silk in the morning breeze Well stop the corn Stop the
wheat Stop the cattle the hogs the chickens
You cant
I cant But all of us together can
No sense the woman said wagging her head No sense
Its sense all right Best sense weve ever had Cant use an army
with no stomach Old as the earth Cant fight without food Takes food
to run a war
Youll starve the two of us thats all youll do Nobody else will
stop work
The farmer turned to his wife Yes they will Everywhere a farmer is
the same He works the land He reads the papers He votes He listens
to the radio He watches the television Mostly he works the land
Alone with his own thoughts and ideas He isnt any different in Maine
than he is in Oregon Weve all stopped work Now This morning
How about those across the ocean Are they stopping too Theyre not
going to feed up their soldiers To kill us if we dont starve first
To
They stopped too A farmer is a farmer Like a leaf on a tree No
matter on what tree in what country on whose land A leaf is a leaf A
farmers the same A farmer is a farmer
It wont work the woman said dully
Yes it will
Theyll make you work
How Its our own property
Theyll take it away from you
Wholl work it then
The woman rocked in her chair her mouth quivering Theyll get
somebody
The farmer shook his head Too many people doing other things like
making shells and guns like sitting in foxholes or flying planes
The woman sat rocking her hands together in her lap It wont work
she repeated
Itll work said the farmer Right now itll work Yes weve got
milkers and shuckers and weve got hatchers for the chickens Weve got
tractors and combines and threshing machines Theyre all mechanical
all right But we dont have mechanical farmers yet The pumps the
tractors the milkers dont work by themselves In time maybe Not now
Were still ahead of them on that Itll work
Go out to the fields Henry his wife said her voice like the sound
of a worn phonograph record
No the farmer said taking a pipe from his overalls I think
instead Ill just sit in the sun and watch the corn Watch the birds on
