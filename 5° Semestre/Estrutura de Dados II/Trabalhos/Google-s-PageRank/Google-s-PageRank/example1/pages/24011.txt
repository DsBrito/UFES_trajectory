THE ILLUSTRATIONS
They went to the January house                    9
They went to the February place                  19
The March house strangely was built in a tree  29
The April house was near a pond                  39
And May herself with a dimple and curl          49
The June house wasnt a house at all             59
The July house was an old old house
With an old old man inside                  71
Oh such a funny August house
It really was like a zoo                     81
Very familiar September seemed                   93
It was a queer October place                    103
The next house stood just back from the street  113
The house of December was all aglow             121
ZODIAC TOWN
Amos and Ann had a poem to learn
A poem to learn one day
But alas they sighed and alack they cried
Twere better to go and play
Ann was sure twas a waste of time
To bother a child with jingling rhyme
Amos said Whats the sense in rhythm
Feet and lines He had finished with em
They peered at the poem with scowly faces
And yawned and stumbled and lost their places
Thena breeze romped by and a bluebird sang
And they shut the book with a snap and a bang
Shut the book and were off and away
Away on flying feet
Never did squirrels move more light
Or rabbits run more fleet
Over a wall and down a lane
And through a field they ran
And Where shall we go said Amos Oh
