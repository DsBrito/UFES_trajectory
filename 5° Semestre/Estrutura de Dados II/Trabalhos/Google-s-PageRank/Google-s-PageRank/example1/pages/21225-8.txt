Illustration LATEST PORTRAIT OF WILLIAM II OF GERMANY
EMPEROR WILLIAM II OF GERMANY
Since William II of Germany ascended the throne as German Emperor and
King of Prussia on June 15 1888 the eyes of Europe have been fixed
on him He has always been rather an unknown quantity and he is
regarded by the powers as an enfant terrible The press of the world
delights in showing up his weak points and the war lord undoubtedly
has them but at the same time he has qualities which are to be
admired and which make him conspicuous among the rulers of Europe
He is popular in Germany and it is not surprising for in spite of
being autocratic to the last degree he is honest courageous
ambitious hard working and withal a thorough German being
intensely patriotic Indeed if the people of the Fatherland had the
right to vote for a sovereign they would undoubtedly choose the
present constitutional ruler for while the virtues we have named may
seem commonplace they are not so when embodied in an emperor One
thing which places William at a disadvantage is his excessive
frankness which is in him almost a fault for if he couched his
utterances in courtly or diplomatic phrases they would pass
unchallenged instead of being cited to ridicule him His mistakes
have largely resulted from his impulsive nature coupled with
chauvinism which is perhaps justifiable or at least excusable
in a ruler
Since the time when William was a child he evidenced a strong desire
to become acquainted with the details of the office to which his lofty
birth entitled him It is doubtful if any king since the time of
Frederick the Great has studied the routine of the public offices and
