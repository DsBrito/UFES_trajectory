PREFACE
This Volume offers to the reader a short and condensed account of the
origin growth and condition of the Church in all parts of the world
from the time of our Lord down to the end of the fifteenth century the
narrative being compressed into as small a compass as is consistent
with a readable form
In such a work the reader will not of course expect to find any full
and detailed account of so vast a subject as PreReformation Church
History  Its object is rather to sketch out the historical truth about
each Church and to indicate the general principles on which further
inquiry may be conducted by those who have the opportunity of making it
It is hoped that those whose circumstances do not admit of an extended
study of the subject will find in the following pages a clear though
condensed view of the periods and Churches treated of and that those
whose reading is of a less limited range will be put in possession of
certain definite lines of thought by which they may be guided in
reading the statements of more elaborate histories
It may be added that the writers standpoint throughout has been that
of a loyal attachment to the Church of England as the authorized
exponent and upholder of Catholic doctrine for English people
