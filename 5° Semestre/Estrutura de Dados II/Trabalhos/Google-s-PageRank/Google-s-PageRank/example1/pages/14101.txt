The brown suit too small for Francie was just right for Rafael and
it would have been hard to find two happier little boys than Francie
and his fish when they walked into the Primary class together
Rafael clapped his hands with the rest when Miss Florence pinned the
fish in the river and the red tag on Francies blouse

And what do you think Out in the big room there were two more new
fish one in Mother Fishers class and one in Father Fishers They
were Mr Lugi and the little Italian mother come to Sundayschool
