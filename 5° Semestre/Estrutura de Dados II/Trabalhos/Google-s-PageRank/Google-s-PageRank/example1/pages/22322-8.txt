FANTASIES
Altruism A Legend of Old Persia
In the flowery land of Persia
Long ago as poets tell
Where three rivers met together
Did a happy people dwell
Never did these happy people
Suffer sickness plague or dearth
Living in a golden climate
In the fairest place on earth
Living thus thro endless summers
And halfsummers hardly colder
Growing tho they hardly guessed it
Very gradually older
I can very well imagine
These old Persian lords and ladies
Sitting in their pleasant gardens
Dreaming dozing where the shade is
Almond trees a mass of blossom
Roses roses red as wine
With the helmets of the tulips
Flaming in a martial line
While beside a marble basin
With a fountain gushing forth
Stands a redlegged crane alighted
From the deserts of the North
So they lived these ancient people
With the happy harmless faces
Dreaming till the purple twilight
In their flowery gardenplaces
Finding every year the sunshine
And the wind a little colder
Growing tho they hardly guessed it
Very gradually older
Till at last they grew so frail
That to their gardens they were carried
Very feeble and exhausted
Weak as babesBut still they tarried
Lying till the purple twilight
