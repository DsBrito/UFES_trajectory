Riddle to the rescueAn awkward fixMark finds a way out of itOld
Rogers cottageThe Riddle familyRoger Riddles yarns and their
effect on meMark takes a different viewIts not all gold that
glittersThe modelMy reception at home
We were all seated round the teatable that is to say my father and
mother my five sisters and three of my elder brothers who were at
hometwo were awayand the same number of young ones who wore
pinafores and last but not least Aunt Deb who was my mothers aunt
and lived with us to manage everything and keep everybody in order for
this neither my father nor mother were very well able to do the latter
nearly worn out with nursing numerous babies while my father was
constantly engaged in the duties of the parish of Sandgate of which he
was incumbent
Aunt Deb was never happy unless she was actively engaged in doing
something or other  At present she was employed in cutting buttering
or covering with jam huge slices of bread which she served out as soon
as they were ready to the juvenile members of the family while my
eldest sister Mary was presiding at the teatray and passing round
the cups as she filled them
When all were served my father stood up and said grace and then all
fell to with an eagerness which proved that we had good appetites
I say Aunt Deb Tom Martin has lent me such a jolly book  Please give
me another slice before you sit down  Its all about Ansons voyage
round the world  I dont know whether I shall like it as well as
Robinson Crusoe or Captain Cooks Voyages or Gullivers Travels
or the Life of Nelson or Paul Jones but I think I shall from the
look I got of it I exclaimed as Aunt Deb was doing what I requested
I wish Dick that you would not read those pestiferous works she
answered as having given me the slice of bread she sat down to sip
her tea  They are all written with an evil intent to make young
people go gadding about the world instead of staying contentedly at
home doing their duty in that state of life to which they are called
But I dont understand why I should not be called to go to sea I
replied I have for a long time made up my mind to go and I intend to
try and become as great a man as Howe or Nelson or Collingwood or
Lord Cochrane or Sir Sidney Smith  Ive just to ask you Aunt Deb
what England would be without her navy and what the navy would be
unless boys were allowed to go into it
Stuff and nonsense you know nothing about the matter Dick  Its very
well for boys who have plenty of interest for sons of peers or members
of parliament or judges or bishops or of others who possess ample
means and influence but the son of a poor incumbent of an out of the
way parish who knows no one and whom nobody knows would remain at the
bottom of the tree
But you forget Aunt Deb that there are ways of getting on besides
through interest  I intend to do all sorts of dashing things and win
my promotion through my bravery  If I can once become a midshipman I
shall have no fear about getting on
Stuff and nonsense again ejaculated Aunt Deb you know nothing about
the matter boy
Dont I though I said to myself for I knew that my father who felt
the importance of finding professions for his sons according to their
tastes had some time before written to Sir Reginald Knowsley of
Leighton Parkthe Squire as he used to be called till he was made a
baronet and still was so very frequently asking him to exert his
influence in obtaining an appointment for me on board a manofwar
This Sir Reginald had promised to do  Aunt Deb however had made many
objections but for once in a way my father had acted contrary to her
sage counsel and as he considered for the best  Still Aunt Deb had not
given in
Youll do as you think fit John she observed to him but you will
repent it  Dick is not able to take care of himself at home much less
will he be so on board a big ship among a number of rough sailors  Let
him remain at school until he is old enough to go into a countinghouse
in London or Bristol where hell make his fortune and become a
respectable member of society as his elder brother means to be or let
him become a master at a school or follow any course of life rather
than that of a soldier or a sailor
I did not venture to interrupt Aunt Deb indeed it would have been
somewhat dangerous to have done so while she was arguing a point but I
had secretly begged my father to write to Sir Reginald as he had
promised assuring him that I had set my heart on following a naval
career and that it would break if I was not allowed to go to sea  This
took place it will be understood some time before the evening of which
I am now speaking
Aunt Deb suspected that my father was inclined to favour my wishes and
this made her speak still more disparagingly than ever of the navy
Tea was nearly over when the post arrived  It only reached us of an
evening and Sarah the maid brought in a large franked letter  I at
once guessed that it was from Sir Reginald Knowsley who was in London
I gazed anxiously at my fathers face as he read it  His countenance
did not however exhibit any especial satisfaction
Who is it from asked my mother in a languid voice  From Sir
Reginald he replied  It is very kind and complimentary  He says
that he has had great pleasure in doing as I requested him  He
fortunately when going down to the Admiralty met his friend Captain
Grummit who has lately been appointed to the Blazeaway manofwar
and who expressed his willingness to receive on board his ship the son
of any friend of his butand here comes the rubCaptain Grummit he
says has made it a rule to take no midshipmen unless their parents
consent to allow them fifty pounds a year in addition to their pay
This sum the Captain states is absolutely necessary to enable them to
make the appearance he desires all his midshipmen to maintain  Fifty
pounds a year is a larger sum I fear than my purse can supply
observed my father when he had read thus far
I should think it was indeed exclaimed Aunt Deb  Fifty pounds a
year  Why thats nearly half of my annual income  It would be
madness John to make any promise of the sort  Suppose you were to let
him go and to stint the rest of his brothers and sisters by making him
so large an allowancewhat will be the result granting that he is not
killed in the first battle he is engaged in or does not fall overboard
and get drowned or the ship is not wrecked and he escapes the other
hundred and one casualties to which a sailor is liable  Why when he
becomes a lieutenant hell marry to a certainty and then hell be
killed and leave you and his mother and me or his brothers and
sisters to look after his widow and children supposing they are able
to do so
But I shall have a hundred and twenty pounds full pay and ninety
pounds a year halfpay I answered I know all about it I can tell
you
Ninety pounds a year and a wife and halfadozen small brats to support
on it exclaimed Aunt Deb in an indignant tone  The wife is sure to
be delicate and know nothing about housekeeping and she and the
children will constantly be requiring the doctor in the house
But you are going very far ahead Aunt Deb I havent gone to sea yet
or been made a lieutenant and if I had theres no reason why I should
marry
There are a great many reasons why you should not exclaimed Aunt Deb
I was going to say that there are many lieutenants in the navy who have
not got wives and I do not suppose that I shall marry when I become
one I answered
It seems pretty certain that you will never be a lieutenant or a
midshipman either if it depends upon your having an allowance of fifty
pounds a year for where that fifty pounds is to come from Im sure I
dont know cried my aunt  As it is your poor father finds it a
difficult matter to find food and clothing for you all and to give you
a proper education and unless the Bishop should suddenly bestow a rich
living on him he at all events could not pay fifty pounds a year or
fifty shillings either so I would advise you forthwith to give up this
mad idea of yours and stay quietly at school until a profitable
employment is found for you
I looked up at my father feeling that there was a good deal of truth in
what Aunt Deb said although I did not like the way she said it
Your aunt only states what is the case Dick said my father  I
should be glad to forward your views but I could not venture with my
very limited income to bind myself to supply you with the sum which Sir
Reginald says is necessary
Couldnt you get Sir Reginald to advance the money  I inquired as
the bright idea occurred to me I will return it to him out of my pay
and prizemoney
Aunt Deb fairly burst out laughing
Out of your pay Dick she exclaimed  Why fifty pounds is required
over and above that pay you talk of every penny of which you will have
to spend and supposing that you should not be employed for a time and
have to live on shore  Do you happen to know what a midshipmans
halfpay is  Why just nothing at all and find yourself  You talk a
good deal of knowing all about the matter but its just clear that you
know nothing
I wish my dear Dick that we could save enough to help you said my
mother who was always ready to assist us in any of our plans but you
know how difficult I find it to get even a few shillings to spend
My mothers remark soothed my irritated feelings and disappointment or
I should have said something which might not have been pleasant to Aunt
Debs ears
We continued talking on the subject I devising all sorts of plans and
arguing tooth and nail with Aunt Deb for I had made up my mind to go to
sea and to go I was determined by hook or by crook but that fifty
pounds a year was I confess a damper to my hopes of becoming a
midshipman
If I could have set to work and made the fifty pounds I would have done
my best to do so but I was as little likely to make fifty pounds as I
was to make fifty thousand  Aunt Deb also reminded my father that it
was not fifty pounds a year for one year but fifty pounds for several
years which he might set down as three hundred pounds at least of
which through my foolish fancy I should be depriving him and my
mother and brothers and sisters
There was no denying that so I felt that I was defeated  I had at
length to go to bed feeling as disappointed and miserable as I had ever
been in my life  To Ned the brother just above me in age who slept in
the same room I opened my heart
I am the most miserable being in the world  I exclaimed  I wish
that I had never been born  If it had not been for Aunt Deb father
would have given in but she hates me I know and always has hated me
and takes a pleasure in thwarting my wishes  Ive a great mind to run
off to sea and enter before the mast just to spite her
Ned who was a quiet amiable fellow taking much after our kind mother
endeavoured to tranquillise my irritated feelings
Dont talk in that way Dick he said in a gentle tone  You might
get tired of the life even if you were to go into the navy but
perhaps means may be found after all to enable you to follow the bent
of your wishes  All naval captains may not insist on their midshipmen
having an allowance of fifty pounds a year or perhaps if they do
some friend may find the necessary funds
I havent a friend in the world I answered  If my father cannot
give me the money I dont know who can  I know that Aunt Deb would not
even if she could
Cheer up Dick said Ned or rather I would advise you to go to
sleep  Perhaps tomorrow morning some bright idea may occur which we
cant think of at present  Ive got my lessons to do before breakfast
so I must not stop awake talking or I shall not be able to arouse
myself
I had begun taking off my clothes and Ned waited until he saw me lie
down when he put out the candle and jumped into bed  I continued
talking till a loud snore from his corner of the room showed me that he
was fast asleep  I soon followed his example but my mind was not idle
for I dreamed that I had gone to sea become a midshipman and was
sailing over the blue ocean with a fair breeze that the captain was
talking to me and telling me what a fine young sailor I had become and
that he had invited me to breakfast with him and had handed me a plate
of buttered toast and a freshlaid egg when looking up I saw his
countenance suddenly change into that of Aunt Deb
Dont you wish you may get it he said  Before you eat that go on
deck and see what weather it is
Of course I had to go when to my astonishment I found the ship rolling
and pitching the foamcovered seas tossing and roaring the officers
shouting and bawling ordering the men to take in sail  Presently there
came a crash the masts went by the board the seas dashed over the
ship and I found myself tumbling about among the breakers until it
seemed almost in an instant I was thrown on the beach where I lay
unable to crawl out of the way of the angry waters which threatened
every moment to carry me off again  In vain I tried to work my way up
the sands with my arms and legs  Presently down I came to find myself
sprawling on the floor
What can have made all that row exclaimed Ned starting up awakened
by the noise of my falling out of bed
I thought I was shipwrecked I answered
Im glad you are not said Ned  So get into bed again and if you
can go to sleep dream of something else
Feeling somewhat foolish I did as he advised but I had first to put my
bedclothes to rights for I had dragged them off with me to the floor
It was no easy matter although I was assisted by the pale light of
early morning which came through the chinks of the shutters
In a short time afterwards Ned again got up to go to his books for he
being somewhat delicate was studying under our father while I who had
been sent to school had just come home for the holidays  I had a
holiday task but had no intention of troubling myself about it at
present  I was therefore somewhat puzzled to know what to do  While
I was dressing it occurred to me that I would go over to Leighton Park
with my rod to try the ponds hoping to return with a basket of fish
I might go there and get an hours fishing and be back again before
breakfast  I tried to persuade Ned to accompany me but he preferred to
stick to his books
Much good may they do you I answered rather annoyed  Why cant you
shut them up for once in a way  Its a beautiful morning and by going
early we are sure to have plenty of sport and you can learn your
lessons just as well after breakfast
Not if I had been out three or four hours fishing and came home wet
and dirty and I want to get my studies over while the day is young and
the air fresh and pure  I can read twice as well now as I shall be able
after breakfast
Well if you are so unsociable I must go by myself I said getting
down my rod from the wall on which it hung with my fishingtackle and
basket  Swinging the latter over my shoulder I crept noiselessly out of
the room and down stairs  No one was stirring so I let myself out by a
back door which led into the garden  Even our old dog Growler did not
bark for he was I suppose taking his morning snooze after having been
on the watch all night
Before setting off I had to get some bait  I found a spade in the
toolhouse and proceeded with it to a certain wellknown heap in the
corner of the kitchen garden full of vivacious worms of a ruddy hue
for which fish of all descriptions had a decided predilection  Even
now whenever I smell a similar odour to that which emanated from the
heap the garden and its surroundings are vividly recalled to my mind
I quickly filled a box which I kept for the purpose with wriggling
worms  It had a perforated lid and contained damp moss
I ought to have thought of getting these fellows yesterday and have
given them time to clean themselves I said to myself  Theyll do
notwithstanding although they will not prove as tough as they ought
Shouldering my rod I made my way out of the garden by a wicket gate and
proceeded across the fields on which it opened towards Leighton Park
The grass was wet with dew the air was pure and fresh almost cold the
birds were singing blithely in the trees  A lark sprang up before me
and rose into the blue air warbling sweetly to welcome the rising sun
which he could see long before its rays glanced over the ground on which
I was walking  I could not help also singing and whistling the bright
air alone being sufficient to raise my spirits  I hurried away as I
was eager to begin fishing for I wanted the fish in the first place
and I knew in the second that Ned would laugh at me if I came back empty
handed  The pond to which I was going although supplied by the same
stream which fed the ornamental piece of water in the neighbourhood of
the Hall was at a distance from it and was accessible without having
to pass through the grounds  It was surrounded by trees and one side
of the bank was thickly fringed by sedges which extended a considerable
way into the water  It served as a preserve for ducks and wild fowl of
various descriptions and was inhabited also by a number of swans who
floated gracefully over its calm surface  As they were accustomed to
depend upon their own exertions for a subsistence they generally kept
at a distance from strangers and I had never been interrupted by them
when fishing  I made my way to a spot where I knew that the water was
deep and where I had frequently been successful in fishing  It was a
green bank which jutted out into a point with bushes on one side but
perfectly free on the other  I quickly got my rod together and my hook
baited with a red wriggling worm  I did not consider that the worm
wriggled because it did not like to be put on the hook but if I had
been asked I should have said that it was rather pleased than otherwise
at having so important a duty to perform as catching fish for my
pleasure  I had a new float white above and green below which I
thought looked very pretty as I threw my line out on the water  Up it
popped at once there being plenty of lead  Before long it began to
move gliding slowly over the surface then faster and faster  I
eagerly held my rod ready to strike as soon as it went down now it
moved on one side now on the other  I knew that there was a fish
coquetting with the bait trying perhaps to suck off the worm without
letting the hook run into its jaws  Before long down went the float
and I gave my rod a scientific jerk against the direction in which the
float was last moving when to my intense satisfaction I felt that I had
hooked a fish but whether a large or a small one I could not at first
tell  I wound up my line until I had got it of a manageable length
then drew it in gradually towards the bank  I soon discovered that I
had hooked a fine tench  It was so astonished at finding itself dragged
through the water without any exertion of its fins that it scarcely
struggled at all and I quickly hauled it up on the bank  It was
threequarters of a pound at least one of the largest I had ever
caught  It was soon unhooked and placed safely in my basket  As I
wanted several more I put on a fresh worm and again threw my line into
the water
Some people say there is no pleasure in floatfishing but for me it
always had a strange fascination that would not have been the case if
I could have seen through the water for I believe the interest depends
upon not knowing what size or sort of fish has got hold of the hook
when the float first begins to move and then glides about as I have
described until it suddenly disappears beneath the surface  I caught
four or five fine tench in little more than twice as many minutes  I
dont know why they took a fancy to bite so freely that fine bright
morning  Generally they take the hook best of a dull muggy day with a
light drizzling rain provided the weather is warm  After I had caught
those four fish I waited for fully ten minutes more without getting
another bite at last I came to the conclusion that only those four
fish had come to that part of the pond  There was another place a
little further on free of trees and bushes where I could throw my line
without the risk of its being caught in the bushes above my head I had
not however generally gone there  Tall sedges lined the shore and
waterlilies floated on the greater part of the surface and its
immediate neighbourhood  It was also somewhat difficult to get at
owing to the dense brushwood which covered the ground close to it  I
waited five minutes more and then slinging my basket behind my back I
made my way to the spot I have described  After catching my line two or
three times in the bushes and spending some time in clearing it I
reached the bank and unslinging my basket quickly once more had my
float in the water  The ground which was covered with moss rather than
grass sloped quietly down to the water and was excessively slippery
As I held my rod expecting every moment to get a bite I heard a low
whistling sound coming from the bushes close to me  At first I thought
it was produced by young frogs but where they were I could not make
out  I observed that several of the swans I have before mentioned were
floating on the surface not far off  Now one now another would put
down its long neck in search of fish or water insects  Presently one of
them caught sight of me and came swimming rapidly towards the extreme
point of the bank  In an instant it landed and halfflying
halfrunning over the ground came full at me through the bushes  To
retreat was impossible should it intend to attack me but I hoped it
would not venture to do so  Before however I had any time for
considering the matter it suddenly spread its powerful wings with one
of which it dealt me such a blow that before I could recover I was sent
down the slippery bank and plunged head over heels into the water  In
my fright I let go my rod but instinctively held out my hands to grasp
whatever I could get hold of
The swan not content with its first success came after me when by
some means or other  I caught hold of it by one of its legs  To this
day I dont know how it happened  The water was deep and I had very
little notion of swimming and having once got hold of something to
support myself I was not inclined to let go while the swan was as much
astonished at being seized hold of as I was  I shouted and bawled for
help although as no one was likely to be at the pond at that early
hour or passing in the neighbourhood there was little chance of
obtaining assistance
Away flew the swan spreading out her broad wings to enable her to rise
above the surface  Instead of seeking the land to my horror she
dragged me right out towards the middle of the pond while the other
swans alarmed at seeing the extraordinary performance of their
companion flew off in all directions  Fortunately I was able to keep
my head above the surface but was afraid of getting a kick from the
other leg of the swan as she struck the water with it to assist herself
in making her onward way but as I held her captive foot at arms
length fortunately she did not touch me  I dared not let go with one
of my hands or I should have tried to seize it  Whether it was
instinct or not which induced her to carry me away from her nest I
cannot tell but that seemed to be her object  I felt as if I was in a
horrid dream compelled to hold on and yet finding myself dragged
forward against my will  The pond was a long and narrow one but it
seemed wider than it had ever done before  The swan instead of going
across to the opposite bank took a course right down the centre  My
shouts and shrieks must have filled her with alarm  On and on she went
flapping her huge wings  I knew that my life depended upon being able
to hold fast to her foot but my arms were beginning to ache and it
seemed to me that we were still a long way from the end  When we got
there I could not tell what she might do  Perhaps I thought she
might turn round and attack me with beak and wings when exhausted by
my struggles I should be unable to defend myself  Still I dared not
venture to let go  I heartily wished that I had been a good swimmer
because then when we got near the end I might have released her and
struck out either for one side or the other  As it was my safety
depended on being dragged by her to the shore  She frequently struck
the water with her wings  Showers of spray came flying over my head
which prevented me from seeing how near I was to it  At last I began to
fear that I should be unable to hold on long enough  My arms ached and
my hands felt cramped still the love of life induced me not to give in
I shouted again and again  Presently I heard a shout in return
Hold on young fellow  Hold on youll be all right  This encouraged
me for I knew that help was at hand  Suddenly as I looked up I saw
the tops of the trees and presently afterwards I found the swan was
trying to make her way up the bank while my feet touched the muddy
bottom
I had no wish to be dragged through the bushes by the swan so as I was
close to the shore I let go but as I did so I fell utterly exhausted
on the bank and was very nearly slipping again into the water  The
swan finding herself free after going a short distance closed her
wings and recollecting I fancy that I had been the cause of her
alarm came rushing back with outstretched neck uttering a strange
hissing sound preparing as I supposed to attack me  I was too much
exhausted to try and get up and endeavour to escape from her  Just as
she was within a few feet of me I saw a boy armed with a thick stick
spring out from among the bushes and run directly towards her  A blow
from his stick turned her aside and instead of making for me she again
plunged into the water and made her way over the surface in the
direction from which we had come
I am very much obliged to you my fine fellow for driving off the
swan or I suppose the savage creature would have mauled me terribly
had she got up to me
Very happy to have done you a service master but it didnt give me
much trouble to do it  However I would advise you not to stop here in
your wet clothes for the mornings are pretty fresh and youll be
catching a bad cold
Thank you I said but I do not feel very well able to walk far just
yet
Have you got far to go home he asked
I told him
Well then you had better come home with me to my fathers cottage
It is away down near the sea and hell give you some hot spirits and
you can turn into my bed while your clothes are drying
I was very glad to accept his proposal for I did not at all fancy
having to go home all dripping to be laughed at by my brothers and to
get a scolding from Aunt Deb into the bargain for I knew she would say
it was all my own fault and that if I had not been prying into the
swans nest the bird would not have attacked me  I did not however
wish to lose my rod and basket of fish and I thought it very probable
that if I left them somebody else would carry them off  I asked my new
friend his name
Mark Riddle he answered
Before I go I must get back my rod and basket of fish it wont take us
long  Would you mind coming with me
No master I dont mind but I would advise you to be quick about it
Mark helped me up and as I soon got the use of my legs we ran round
outside the trees as fast as we could go  The basket of fish was safe
enough on the bank but the rod was floating away at some distance
Oh dear oh dear  I shall never be able to get it I exclaimed
What  Cant you swim master asked Mark
I confessed that I was afraid I could not swim far enough to bring it
in
Well never you mind  Ill have it in a jiffy and stripping off his
clothes he plunged into the water and soon brought in the rod
Theres a fish on the hook Ive a notion he said as he handed me the
butt end of the rod
He was right and as he was dressing not taking long to rub himself dry
with his handkerchief I landed a fine fat tench
That belongs to you I said  And indeed I ought to give you all
the fish I have in my basket
Much obliged master but Ive got a fine lot myself which I pulled
out of the pond this morning only dont you say a word about it for
the Squire Ive a notion doesnt allow us poor people to come fishing
here
I assured Mark that I would not inform against him and having taken my
rod to pieces and wound up my line I said that I was ready to set out
Mark by that time was completely dressed  Just as we were about to
start I saw the swanI suppose the same one which had dragged me across
the pondcome swimming back at a rapid rate towards where we were
standing in the neighbourhood as I well knew of her nest  Whether or
not she fancied we were about to interfere with her young we could not
tell but we agreed that it was well to beat a retreat  We accordingly
set off and ran on until we reached the further end of the pond when
Mark asking me to stop a minute disappeared among the bushes and in a
few minutes returned with a rough basket full of fine tench carp and
eels  I had a notion that some nightlines had assisted him to take so
many  I did not however ask questions just then and once more we set
off running  Wet as I was I was very glad to move quickly not that I
felt particularly cold for the sun had now risen some way above the
trees and as there was not a breath of air his rays warmed me and
began to dry my outer garments  I must have had a very draggled look
and I had no wish to be seen by any one at home in that condition  In
little more than a quarter of an hour we came in sight of a cottage
situated below a cliff on the side of a ravine opening out towards the
sea  A stream which flowed from the Squires ponds running through it
That is my home and father will be right glad to see you said Mark
pointing to it
A fine old sailorlike man with a straw hat and round jacket came out of
the door as we approached and began to look about him in the fashion
seafaring men have the habit of doing when they first turn out in the
morning to ascertain what sort of weather it is likely to be  His eyes
soon fell on Mark and me as we ran down the ravine
Who have you got with you my son he asked
The young gentleman from the vicarage  He has had a ducking and he
wants to dry his clothes before he goes home or maybe hed call it a
swanning seeing it was one of those big white birds which pulled him
in and towed him along from one end of the pond to the other eh
master  Whats your name
Richard I replied though Im generally called Dick not at all
offended at my companions familiarity
You are welcome Master Dick and if you like to turn into Marks bed
or put on a shirt and pair of trousers of his well get your duds dried
before the kitchen fire in a jiffy said the old sailor  Come in
come in it doesnt do to stand out in the air when you are wet through
with fresh water
I gladly entered the old sailors cottage where I found his wife and a
young daughter a year or two older than Mark busy in getting breakfast
