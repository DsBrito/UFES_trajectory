newrisen from the main Drink with me
The tavern of the Triple Tun rang with acclamation and the windows
being set wide because of the warmth of the June afternoon the noise
rushed into the street and waylaid the ears of them who went busily to
and fro and of them who lounged in the doorway or with folded arms
played Atlas to the tavern walls Who be the roisterers within
demanded a passing citizen of one of these supporters The latter made
no answer he was a ragged retainer of Melpomene and he awaited the
coming forth of Sir Mortimer Ferne a notable encourager of all who
would scale Parnassus But his neighbor a boy in blue and silver
squatted upon a sunny bench vouchsafed enlightenment
Travellers to strange places quoth he taking a straw from his mouth
and stretching long arms Tall men swingers in Brazilbeds
parcelgilt with the Emperor of Manoa and playfellows to the nymphs of
Don Juan Ponce de Leon his fountainin plain words my master Sir
Mortimer Ferne Captain of the Cygnet and his guests to dinner to
wit Sir John Nevil Admiral of our fleet with sundry of us captains
and gentlemen adventurers to the Indies and for seasoning a handful
of my masters poor friends such as courtiers and great lords
and poets
Thinkest to don thy masters wit with his livery snapped the
poetaster Tis a chain for a mantoo heavy for thy wearing
The boy stretched his arms again Master no more than in reason
quoth he I also am a gentleman Heigho The sun shineth hotter here
than in the doldrums
Well go thy ways for a sprightly crack said the citizen preparing
to go his I know them now for my cousin Parker hath a venture in the
Mere Honour and that is the great ship the Queen hath lent Sir John
his other ships being the Marigold the Cygnet and the Star and
theyre all alying above Greenwich ready to sail on the morrow for the
Spanish Main
Youve hit it in the clout yawned the boy Ill bring you an emerald
hollowed out for a reliquaryif I think ont
Withindoors in the Triple Tuns best room where much sherris sack was
being drunk a gentleman with a long face and mustachios twirled to a
point leaned his arm upon the table and addressed him whose pledge had
been so general Armida gardens and silversinging mermaiden and
Aphrodite England quotha Pike and cutlass and good red gold saith
the plain man O Apollo what a thing it is to be learned and a maker
of songs
Athwart his laughing words came from the lower end of the board a deep
and harsh voice The speaker was Captain Robert Baldry of the Star
and he used the deliberation of one who in his drinking had gone far and
fast I pledge all scholars turned soldiers he said all courtiers
who stay not at court all poets who win tall ships at the point of a
canzonetta Did Sir Mortimer Ferne make verseselegies and epitaphs and
such toysat Fayal in the Azores two years ago
There followed his speech heard of all in the room a moment of amazed
silence Mortimer Ferne put his tankard softly down and turned in his
seat so that he might more closely observe his fellow adventurer
For myself when an Armada is at my heels the cares of the moon do not
concern me went on Baldry with the gravity of an oracle Had Nero
not fiddled perhaps Rome had not burned
And where got you that information sir asked his host in a most
courtierlike voice
Oh in the streets of Rome a thousand years ago Twas common talk
The Captain of the Star tilted his cup and was grieved to find
it empty
I have later news said the other as smoothly as before At Fayal in
the Azores
He was interrupted by Sir John Nevil who had risen from his chair and
beneath whose stare of surprise and anger Baldry being far from actual
drunkenness moved uneasily
I will speak Mortimer said the Admiral Captain Baldry not being my
guest Sir at Fayal in the Azores that disastrous day we did what we
couldmortal men can do no more Taken by surprise as we were ships
were lost and brave men tasted death but there was no shame He who
held command that lamentable day was Captainnow Sir MortimerFerne
for I who was Admiral of the expedition must lie in my cabin ill
almost unto death of a calenture I dare aver that no wiser head ever
drew safety for many from such extremity of peril and no readier sword
ever dearly avenged one days defeat and loss Your news sir was
false I drink to a gentleman of known discretion proved courage
unstained honor
It needed not the glance of his eye to bring men to their feet They
rose courtiers and university wits soldiers home from the Low
Countries kinsmen and country friends wealthy merchants who had staked
their gold in this and other voyages adventurers who with Frobisher and
Gilbert had sailed the icy seas or with Drake and Hawkins had gazed
upon the Southern Cross Captain Baptist Manwood of the Marigold
Lieutenant Ambrose Wynch Giles Arden Anthony Paget good men and tall
who greatly prized the man who alone kept his seat smiling upon them
from the head of the long table in the Triple Tuns best room Baldry
muttering in his beard that he had made a throw amiss and that the wine
was to blame stumbled to his feet and stood with the rest Sir
Mortimer Ferne cried they all and drank to the seated figure The
name was loudly called and thus it was no slight tide of sound which
bore it that high noon in the year 158 into the busy London street
Bow Bells were ringing and to the boy in blue and silver upon the bench
without the door they seemed to take the words and sound them again and
again deeply clearly above the voices of the city
Mortimer Ferne his hand resting upon the table before him waited until
there was quiet in the tavern of the Triple Tun then because he felt
deeply spoke lightly
My lords and gentlemen he said and you John Nevil whom I
reverence as my commander and love as my friend I give you thanks Did
we lose at Fayal Then this voyage at some other golden island we
shall win Honor stayed with us that bloody day and shall we not now
bring her home enthroned Ay and for her handmaidens fame and noble
service and wealthwealth with which to send forth other ships hounds
of the sea which yet may pull down this Spanish stag of ten By my
faith I sorrow for you whom we leave behind
Look that I overtake you not Mortimer cried Sidney Walter Raleigh
and I have plans for next year You and I may yet meet beneath a
palmtree
And I also Sir Mortimer exclaimed Captain Philip Amadas Sir Walter
hath promised me a ship
When the old knight my father dies and I come into my property put
in loudly a fancyfired youth from Devon Ill go out over bar in a
ship of my own Ill have all my mariners dressed like Sir Hugh
Willoughbys men in the picture and when I come home
Towing the King of Spain his platefleet behind you quoth the
mustachioed gentleman
all my sails shall be cloth of gold continued wineflushed
oneandtwenty The maindeck shall be piled with bars of silver and
in the hold shall be pearls and pieces of gold doubloons emeralds as
great as filberts
At Panama saw I an emerald greater than a pigeons egg cried one who
had sailed in the Golden Hind
Sir Mortimer laughed Why our very speech grows richas did thine
long since Philip Sidney And now Giles Arden show these stayathome
gentlemen the stones the Bonaventure brought in the other day from
that coast we touched at two years agone If we miss the platefleet my
masters if we find Cartagena or Santa Marta too strong for us there is
yet the unconquered land the Hesperidian garden whence came these
golden apples Deliver good dragon
He of the mustachios laid side by side upon the board three pieces of
glittering rock whereat every man bent forward
Marcasite said one doubtfully
El madre del oro suggested another
White spar said Arden authoritatively and containeth of gold ten
pounds to the hundredweight Moreover He sifted down upon the dark
wood beside the stones a thimbleful of dull yellow grains The sands of
Pactolus gentlemen Sure twas in no Grecian river that King Midas
bathed himself
Those of the company to whom had never before been exhibited these
samples of imperial riches craned their necks and the looks of some
were musing and of others keenly eager The room fell silent and still
they gazed and gazed at the small heap of glistening stones and those
few grains of gold They were busy men in the vanguard of a quickened
age and theirs were its ardors its Arguseyed fancy and potent
imagination Show them an acorn and straightway they saw a forest of
oaks an inch of a rainbow and the mind grasped the whole vast arch
zenithreaching sevencolored enclosing far horizons So now in
addition to the gleaming fragments upon the table before them they saw
mountain ranges with ledges of rock all sparkling like this ore deep
mines with Indian workers packtrains and burdened holds of ships
After a time one lifted a piece of the ore hesitatingly as though he
made to take up all the Indies scrutinized it closely weighed it
passed it to his neighbor It went the round of the company each man
handling it each with the talisman between his fingers gazing through
the bars of this present hour at a pageant and phantasmagoria of his own
creating At last it came to the hand of an old merchant who held it a
moment or two looking steadfastly upon it then slowly put it down
Well said he may God send you furthering winds Sir Mortimer and
Sir John and make their galleons and galliasses their caravels and
carracks as bowed corn before you Those of your company who are to
die may they die cleanly and those who are to live live nobly and
may not one of you fall into the hands of the Holy Office
Amen to that Master Hudson quoth Arden
The Holy Office cried a Banbury man I had a cousin sirsan
honest fellow with whom I had gone birdsnesting when we were boys
together He was master of a merchantmanthe Red Lionthat by foul
treachery was taken by the Spaniards at Cales The priests put forth
their hands and clutched him who was ever outspoken ever held fast to
his own opinion To die that is easy but when I learned what was
done to him before he was let to die The speaker broke off with an
oath and sat with fixed gaze his hand beating upon the table a
noiseless tattoo
To die said Mortimer Ferne slowly To die cleanly having lived
noblyit is a good wish Master Hudson To die greatlyas did your
cousin sira good knight and true defending faith and loyalty what
more consummate flower for crown of life What loftier victory supremer
triumph Pain of body what is it Let the body cry out so that it
betray not the mind cheat not the soul into a remediless prison of
perdition and shame
He drank of his wine then with a slight laugh and wave of his hand
dismissed a subject too grave for the hour A little later he arose with
his guests from the table and since time was passing and for some there
was much to do men began to exchange farewells Tomorrow would see the
adventurers gone from England today kinsmen and friends must say
goodby warmly with clasping of hands and embracing even with tears
for it was an age when men did not scorn to show emotion A thousand
perils awaited those who went nor for those who stayed would time or
tide make tarrying It was most possible that they who parted now would
find this side eternity no second inn of meeting
From his perch beside the door the boy in blue and silver watched his
masters guests step into the sunlight and go away A throng had
gathered in front of the tavern for the most part of those within were
men of note and Sir John Nevils adventure to the Indies had long been
general talk Singly or in little groups the revellers issued from the
tavern and for this or that known figure and favorite the crowd had its
comment and cheering At last all were gone save the adventurers
themselves who having certain final arrangements to make stayed to
hold council in the Triple Tuns long room
Their conference was not long Presently came forth Captain Baptist
Manwood of the Marigold with his lieutenants Wynch and Paget and
Captain Robert Baldry of the Star The four talking together
started towards the waterside where they were to take boat for the ships
that lay above Greenwich but ere they had gone forty paces Baldry felt
his sleeve twitched Turning he found at his elbow the blue and silver
sprig who served Sir Mortimer Ferne
Save you sir said the boy Theres a gentleman at the Triple Tun
desires your honor would give him five minutes of your company
I did expect a man of my acquaintance a Pauls man with a good rapier
to sell quoth Baldry Boy is the gentleman a lean gentleman with a
Duke Humphrey look Wait for me sirs at the stairs
Within the Triple Tun Sir John Nevil yet sat at table pondering certain
maps and charts spread out before him while Mortimer Ferne having
reentered the room after a moments absence leaned over his
commanders shoulder and watched the latters forefinger tracing the
coastline from the Cape of Three Points to Golden Castile By the window
stood Arden while on a settle near him lounged Henry Sedley lieutenant
to the Captain of the Cygnet moreover a young gentleman of great
promise a smooth dark melancholy beauty and a pretty taste in
dress In his hands was a gittern which had been hanging on the wall
above him and he played upon it softly a sweet and plaintive air
In upon these four burst Baldry who not finding the Pauls man and
trader in rapiers drew himself up sharply Sir Mortimer came forward
and made him a low bow which he not to be outdone in courtesy any
more than in weightier matters returned in his own manner fierce and
arrogant as that of a Spanish conquistador
Captain Robert Baldry I trusted that you would return said Ferne
And now since you are no longer guest of mine we will resume our talk
of Fayal in the Azores Your gossips lied sir and he who not staying
to examine a quarrel becomes a repeater of lies may chance upon a
summer day in a tavern such as this to be called a liar My
cartel sir
He flung his glove which scarce had felt the floor before the other
snatched it up Gods death you shall be accommodated he cried
Here and now ist not and with sword and dagger Sir I will spit you
like a lark or like the Spaniard I did vanquish for a Harry shilling
at El Gran Canario last Lukes day
The three witnesses of the challenge sprang to their feet the gittern
falling from Sedleys hands and Sir Johns papers fluttering to the
floor The latter thrust himself between the two who had bared their
weapons What is this gentlemen Mortimer Ferne put up your sword
Captain Baldry your valor may keep for the Spaniards Obey me sirs
Let be John Nevil said Ferne Tomorrow I become your sworn man
Today my honor is my Admiral
Will you walk Sir Mortimer Ferne demanded Baldry The Bull and
Bear just down the street hath a little parlora most sweet retired
place and beareth no likeness to the poop of the Mere Honour Sir
John Nevil your servant sirtomorrow
Illustration SIR JOHN THRUST HIMSELF BETWEEN THE TWO
My servant today sir thundered the Admiral in that I will force
you to leave this quarrel Death of my life shall this get abroad Not
that common soldiers or mariners ashore fall out and cudgel each other
until the one cannot handle a rope nor the other a morrispike not
that wild gallants reckless and broken adventurers whose loss the next
daredevil scamp may supply choose the eve of sailing for a duello in
which one or both may be slain but that strive together my captains
men vowed to noble service loyal aid whose names are in all mouths
who go forth upon this adventure not I trust in God with an eye single
to the gain of the purse but thinking rather to pluck green laurels
for themselves and to bring to the Queen and England gifts of waning
danger waxing power What reproachwhat evil augurynay perhaps
what maiming of our enterprise Leaders and commanders that you are
with your goodly ships your mariners and soldiers awaiting you and
above us all the lodestar of noblest duty truest honorwill you thus
prefer to the common good your private quarrel Nay now I might say
you shall not but instead I choose to think you will not
The speech was of the longest for the Admiral who was a man of golden
silences His look had been upon Baldry but his words were for Mortimer
Ferne at whom he looked not at all I have been challenged sir
cried Baldry roughly Draw back Gods wounds not I
His antagonist bit his lip until the blood sprang The insult was
gross he said with haughtiness but since I may not deny the truth
of your words John Nevil I will reword my cartel Captain Robert
Baldry I do solemnly challenge you to meet me with sword and dagger
upon that day which sees our return to England
A far day that perhaps cried Baldry But so be it Ill not fail
you Sir Mortimer Ferne Look that you fail not me
Sir cried Ferne sharply
The Admiral struck the table a great blow Gentlemen no more of this
What will you in this mood go forth side by side to meet a common foe
Nay I must have you touch hands
The Captain of the Cygnet held out his hand He of the Star first
swore then burst into a great laugh finally laid his own upon it
Now we are turtledoves Sir John nothing less and the Star and the
Cygnet may bill and coo from the Thames to Terra Firma Suddenly he
ceased to laugh and let fall his hand But I have not forgotten he
said that at Fayal in the Azores I had a brother slain
He was gone swinging from the room with scant ceremony loudly ordering
from his path the loiterers at the inn door They whose company he had
quitted were silent for a moment then said Sir Mortimer slowly I
remember nowthere was a Thomas Baldry master of the Speedwell
Well it was a sorry business that day If from that muck of blood and
horror was born Detraction
The man was mad thrust in young Sedley hotly Detraction and you
have no acquaintance
Ferne with a slight laugh stooped to pick up the fallen gittern She
kept knighthood and me apart for a year Henry Tis a powerful dame a
most subtle and womanish foe who knoweth not or esteemeth not the rules
of chivalry Having yielded to plain Truth she yet as today raiseth
unawares an arm to strike He hung the gittern upon its peg then went
across to the Admiral and put both hands upon his shoulders The smile
was yet upon his lips but his voice had a bitter ring John John
he said old wounds leave not their aching That tall fanfaronading
fellow hath a power to anger menot his words alone but the man
himself Well let him go until the day we come sailing back to
England For his words He paused and a shadow came over his face
Who knows himself he said There are times when I look within and
doubt my every quality that men are pleased to give me God smiles upon
meperhaps He smiles with contempt I would that I had followed not
led that day at Fayal
Arden burst into a laugh The Admiral turned and stared at him who had
spoken with a countenance half severity half deep affection What
stings that yet he said I think you may have that knowledge of
yourself that you were born to lead and that knowledge of higher things
that shame is of the devil but defeat ofttimes of God How idly do we
talk today
Idly enough agreed Ferne with a quick sigh He lifted his hands from
the others shoulders and with an effort too instantaneous to be
apparent shook off his melancholy Arden took up his hat and swung his
short cloak over his shoulder
Since we may not fight he said Ill een go play Theres a pretty
lady hard by who loves me dearly Ill go tell her tales of the Carib
beauties Master Sedley you are for the court I know Would the gods
had sent me such a sister Do you go to Leicester House Mortimer If
not my fair Discretion hath a mate
I answered Ferne am also for Greenwich
Arden laughed again Her Grace gives you yet another audience Or is it
that hath come to court that Nonpareil that radiant Incognita that
berhymed Dione at whose real name you keep us guessing I thought the
violet satin was not for naught
In that you speak with truth said the other coolly for thirty
acres of good Devon land went to its procuring Since you are for the
court Henry Sedley one wherry may carry the two of us
When the two adventurers and the boy in blue and silver had made half
the distance to the pleasant palace where like a flight of multicolored
birds had settled for the moment Elizabeths migratory court the
gentlemen became taciturn and fell at length to silent musing each upon
his own affairs The boy liked it not for their discourse had been of
armor and devices of warhorses and Spanish swords and such knightly
matters as pleased him to the marrow He himself Robinadale they
called him meant to be altogether such a one as his master in violet
satin Not a seadog simply and terrible fighter like Captain Manwood or
Ambrose Wynch nor a ruffler like Baldry nor even a high cold
gentleman like Sir John who slew Spaniards for the good of God and the
Queen and whose slow words when he was displeased cut like a ropes
end But he would fight and he would sing he would laugh with his foe
and then courteously kill him he would know how to enter the presence
how to make a great Queen smile and sigh and then again amid the
thunder and reek of the fight on decks slippery with blood he would
strain half naked with the mariners he would lead the boarders he
would deal death with a flashing sword and a face that seen through the
smoke wreaths was so calm and highAnd the Queen might knight
himone day the Queen might knight him And the people at home turning
in the street would look and cry Tis Sir Robert Dale as now they
cry Sir Mortimer Ferne
Robinadale drew in his breath and clenched his hands with
determination then the key being too high for long sustaining came
down to earth and the contemplation of the brightrunning Thames its
shifting banks and the shipping on its bosom The river glided between
tall houses and there were voices on the water sounding from stately
barges swiftplying wherries ships at anchor both great and small
Over all played mild sunshine hung pale blue skies The boy thought of
other rivers he had seen and would see again silent streams gliding
through forests of a fearful loveliness miles of churned foam rushing
between black teeth of jagged rock to the sheer desperate
earthshaking cataract liquid highways to the realms of strange dreams
He turned involuntarily and met his masters eye Between these two
master and boy knave and knight there was at times so strange a
comprehension that Robinadale was scarcely startled to find that his
thoughts had been read
Ay Robin said Ferne smiling other and stranger waters than those
of Father Thames And yet I know not Life is one though today we
glide through the sunshine to a fair Queens palace and tomorrow we
strive like fiends from hell for those two sirens Lust of Gold and Lust
of Blood Therefore Robin an you toss your silver brooch into the
Thames it may come to hand on the other side of the world swirling
towards you in some Arethusa fountain
I see the ships master cried the boy Ho the Cygnet the bonny
white Cygnet
They lay in a halfmoon with the westering sun striking full upon the
windows of their high castellated poops Their great guns gleamed mast
and spar and rigging made network against the blue high in air floated
bright pennants and the red cross in the white field To and fro plied
small boats while over the water to them in the wherry came a pleasant
hum of preparation for the morrows sailing Upon the Cygnet lying
next to the Mere Honour and a very noble ship the mariners began
to sing
Shall we not row more closely cried Sedley The Cygnet knows not
that it is you who pass
Sir Mortimer laughed No no I come to her arms from the Palace
tonight Trouble her not now with genuflections and salutings His
eyes dwelt with love upon his ship How clearly sounds the singing
he said
So clearly did it sound over the water that it kept with them when the
ships were passed Robinadale had his fancies to which at times he
gave voice scarce knowing that he had spoken Tis the ship herself
that sings he now began to say to himself in a low voice over and
over again Tis the ship singing the ship singing because she goes on
a voyagea long voyage
Sirrah cried his master somewhat sharply Know you not that the
swan sings but upon one voyage and that her last Tis not the Cygnet
that sings but upon her sing my mariners and soldiers for that they go
forth to victory
He put his hands behind his head and with a light in his eyes looked
back to the dwindling ships Victory he repeated beneath his breath
Such fame such service as that earthworm that same Detraction shall
raise no more her lying head He turned to Sedley I am glad Harry
that your lot is cast with mine For we go forth to victory lad
The younger man answered him impetuously a flush of pride mounting to
his smooth dark cheek I doubt it not Sir Mortimer nor of my
gathering laurels since I go with you I count myself most fortunate
He threw back his head and laughed I have no ladylove he said and
so I will heap the laurels in the lap of my sister Damaris
By now the tide being with them they were nearing Greenwich House
Ferne dipped his hand into the water then straightening himself shook
from it the sparkling drops and looked in the face of the youth who was
to make with him his maiden voyage
You could heap laurels in the lap of no sweeter lady he said
courteously I thought you went on yesterday to say farewell to
Mistress Damaris Sedley
Why so I did said the other simply We said farewell with our
eyes in the presence while the Queen talked with my Lord of Leicester
in the antechamber with our hands in the long gallery with our lips
and when we reached the gardens and there was none at all to see we
een put our arms about each other and wept It is a right noble wench
my sister and loves me dearly And then while we talked one of her
fellow maids came hurriedly to call her for her Grace would go
ahawking and Damaris was in attendance So I swore I would see her
again today though twere but for a moment
The rowers brought the wherry to the Palace landing Sir Mortimer
stepping out upon the broad stairs began to mount them somewhat slowly
Sedley and Robinadale following him Halfway up Sedley noting the
rich suit worn so pointdevice and aware of how full in the sunshine of
the Queens favor stood for the moment his Captain asked if he were for
the presence Ferne shook his head Not now May I know Henry
where you and your sister meet
In the little covert of the park where we said goodby on yesterday
There were surprise and some question in the youths upward glance at
the man in violet satin standing a step or two above him his hand
resting upon the stone balustrade a smile in his eyes but none upon
the finely cut lips quite grave and steady beneath the slight mustache
Ferne reading the question gave after just a moments pause the
answer My dear lad he said and the smile in his eyes grew more
distinct and kindly to Mistress Damaris Sedley I also would say
farewell He laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder For I would
know HenryI would know if through all the days and nights that await
us over the brim of tomorrow I may dream of an hour to come when that
dear and fair lady shall bid me welcome His eyes looked into the
distance and the smile had crept to his lips It was my meaning to
speak to her tonight before I left the Palace but this chance offers
better Will you give me precedence Henry let me see and speak to your
sister alone in that same covert of which you tell me
Butbut stammered Sedley
Sir Mortimer laughed But  Dione you would say Ah faithless
poet forsworn knight you would say Not so my friend He looked far
away with shining eyes That unknown nymph that lady whom I praise in
verse whose poet I am that Dione at whose real name you all do vainly
guessit is thy sister lad Nayshe knows me not for her worshipper
nor do I know that I can win her love I would try
Sedleys smooth cheek glowed and his eyes shone He was young he loved
his sister orphaned like himself and the neglected ward of a decaying
house while to his ardent fancy the man above him superb in his violet
dress courteous and excellent in all that he did was a very Palmerin
or Amadis de Gaul Now impetuously he put his hand upon that other
hand touching his shoulder and drew it to his lips in a caress of
which being Elizabethans neither was at all ashamed In the dark
deeply fringed eyes that he raised to his leaders face there was a
boyish and poetic adoration for the seacaptain the man of war who was
yet a courtier and a scholar the violet knight who was to lead him up
the heights which long ago the knight himself had scaled
Damaris is a fair maid and good and learned he said in a whisper
half shy half eager May you dream as you wish Sir Mortimer For the
way to the coverttis by yonder path thats all in sunshine
II
Beneath a great oaktree where light and shadow made a checkered round
Mistress Damaris Sedley sat upon the earth in a gown of rosecolored
silk Across her knee under her clasped hands lay a light racket for
she had strayed this way from battledore and shuttlecock and the
sprightly company of maids of honor and gentlemen pensioners engaged
thereat She was a fair lady of a clear pallor with a red mouth very
subtly charming and dark eyes beneath level brows Her eyes had depths
on depths to one player of battledore and shuttlecock they were merely
large brown orbs another might find in them worlds below worlds a
third going deeper might Actonlike surprise the bare soul A
curiously wrought net of gold caught her dark hair in its meshes and
pearls were in her ears and around the white column of her throat
rising between the ruffs gossamer walls She fingered the racket idly
listening the while for a footfall beyond her round of trees Hearing
it at last and taking it for her brothers she looked up with a proud
and tender smile
Fie upon thee for a laggard Henry she began I warrant thy Captain
meets not his Dione with so slow a step Then seeing who stood before
her she left her seat between the oak roots and curtsied low Sir
Mortimer Ferne she said and rising to her full height met his eyes
with that deeper gaze of hers
Ferne advanced and bending his knee to the short turf took and kissed
her hand Fair and sweet lady he said I made suit to your brother
and he has given me his friend this happy chance Now I make my
supplication to you to whom I would be that and more All this week
have I vainly sought for speech with you alone But now these blessed
trees hem us round there is none to spy or listenand here is a mossy
bank fit throne for a faery queen Will you hear me speak
The maid of honor looked at him with rose bloom upon her cheeks and in
her eyes although they smiled a moisture as of halfsprung tears Is
