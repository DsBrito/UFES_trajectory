In order to place a sufficient distance between themselves and the
French army the Maugrabins made forced marches and only halted when
night was upon them They camped round a well overshadowed by palm
trees under which they had previously concealed a store of provisions
Not surmising that the notion of flight would occur to their prisoner
they contented themselves with binding his hands and after eating a
few dates and giving provender to their horses went to sleep
When the brave Provencal saw that his enemies were no longer watching
him he made use of his teeth to steal a scimiter fixed the blade
between his knees and cut the cords which prevented him from using
his hands in a moment he was free He at once seized a rifle and a
dagger then taking the precautions to provide himself with a sack of
dried dates oats and powder and shot and to fasten a scimiter to
his waist he leaped on to a horse and spurred on vigorously in the
direction where he thought to find the French army So impatient was
he to see a bivouac again that he pressed on the already tired courser
at such speed that its flanks were lacerated with his spurs and at
last the poor animal died leaving the Frenchman alone in the desert
After walking some time in the sand with all the courage of an escaped
convict the soldier was obliged to stop as the day had already
ended In spite of the beauty of an Oriental sky at night he felt he
had not strength enough to go on Fortunately he had been able to find
a small hill on the summit of which a few palm trees shot up into the
air it was their verdure seen from afar which had brought hope and
consolation to his heart His fatigue was so great that he lay down
upon a rock of granite capriciously cut out like a campbed there he
fell asleep without taking any precaution to defend himself while he
slept He had made the sacrifice of his life His last thought was one
of regret He repented having left the Maugrabins whose nomadic life
seemed to smile upon him now that he was far from them and without
help He was awakened by the sun whose pitiless rays fell with all
their force on the granite and produced an intolerable heatfor he
had had the stupidity to place himself adversely to the shadow thrown
by the verdant majestic heads of the palm trees He looked at the
solitary trees and shudderedthey reminded him of the graceful shafts
crowned with foliage which characterize the Saracen columns in the
cathedral of Arles
But when after counting the palm trees he cast his eyes around him
the most horrible despair was infused into his soul Before him
stretched an ocean without limit The dark sand of the desert spread
further than eye could reach in every direction and glittered like
steel struck with bright light It might have been a sea of
lookingglass or lakes melted together in a mirror A fiery vapor
carried up in surging waves made a perpetual whirlwind over the
quivering land The sky was lit with an Oriental splendor of
insupportable purity leaving naught for the imagination to desire
Heaven and earth were on fire
The silence was awful in its wild and terrible majesty Infinity
immensity closed in upon the soul from every side Not a cloud in the
sky not a breath in the air not a flaw on the bosom of the sand
ever moving in diminutive waves the horizon ended as at sea on a
clear day with one line of light definite as the cut of a sword
The Provencal threw his arms round the trunk of one of the palm trees
as though it were the body of a friend and then in the shelter of
the thin straight shadow that the palm cast upon the granite he
wept Then sitting down he remained as he was contemplating with
profound sadness the implacable scene which was all he had to look
upon He cried aloud to measure the solitude His voice lost in the
hollows of the hill sounded faintly and aroused no echothe echo
was in his own heart The Provencal was twentytwo years oldhe
loaded his carbine
Therell be time enough he said to himself laying on the ground
the weapon which alone could bring him deliverance
Viewing alternately the dark expanse of the desert and the blue
expanse of the sky the soldier dreamed of Francehe smelled with
delight the gutters of Parishe remembered the towns through which he
had passed the faces of his comrades the most minute details of his
life His Southern fancy soon showed him the stones of his beloved
Provence in the play of the heat which undulated above the wide
expanse of the desert Realizing the danger of this cruel mirage he
went down the opposite side of the hill to that by which he had come
up the day before The remains of a rug showed that this place of
refuge had at one time been inhabited at a short distance he saw some
palm trees full of dates Then the instinct which binds us to life
awoke again in his heart He hoped to live long enough to await the
passing of some Maugrabins or perhaps he might hear the sound of
cannon for at this time Bonaparte was traversing Egypt
This thought gave him new life The palm tree seemed to bend with the
weight of the ripe fruit He shook some of it down When he tasted
this unhopedfor manna he felt sure that the palms had been
cultivated by a former inhabitantthe savory fresh meat of the dates
were proof of the care of his predecessor He passed suddenly from
dark despair to an almost insane joy He went up again to the top of
the hill and spent the rest of the day in cutting down one of the
sterile palm trees which the night before had served him for shelter
A vague memory made him think of the animals of the desert and in
case they might come to drink at the spring visible from the base of
the rocks but lost further down he resolved to guard himself from
their visits by placing a barrier at the entrance of his hermitage
In spite of his diligence and the strength which the fear of being
devoured asleep gave him he was unable to cut the palm in pieces
though he succeeded in cutting it down At eventide the king of the
desert fell the sound of its fall resounded far and wide like a sigh
in the solitude the soldier shuddered as though he had heard some
voice predicting woe
But like an heir who does not long bewail a deceased relative he tore
off from this beautiful tree the tall broad green leaves which are its
poetic adornment and used them to mend the mat on which he was to
sleep
Fatigued by the heat and his work he fell asleep under the red
curtains of his wet cave
In the middle of the night his sleep was troubled by an extraordinary
noise he sat up and the deep silence around allowed him to
distinguish the alternative accents of a respiration whose savage
energy could not belong to a human creature
A profound terror increased still further by the darkness the
silence and his waking images froze his heart within him He almost
felt his hair stand on end when by straining his eyes to their utmost
he perceived through the shadow two faint yellow lights At first he
attributed these lights to the reflections of his own pupils but soon
the vivid brilliance of the night aided him gradually to distinguish
the objects around him in the cave and he beheld a huge animal lying
but two steps from him Was it a lion a tiger or a crocodile
The Provencal was not sufficiently educated to know under what species
his enemy ought to be classed but his fright was all the greater as
his ignorance led him to imagine all terrors at once he endured a
cruel torture noting every variation of the breathing close to him
without daring to make the slightest movement An odor pungent like
that of a fox but more penetrating more profoundso to speak
filled the cave and when the Provencal became sensible of this his
terror reached its height for he could no longer doubt the proximity
of a terrible companion whose royal dwelling served him for a
shelter
Presently the reflection of the moon descending on the horizon lit up
the den rendering gradually visible and resplendent the spotted skin
of a panther
This lion of Egypt slept curled up like a big dog the peaceful
possessor of a sumptuous niche at the gate of an hotel its eyes
opened for a moment and closed again its face was turned towards the
man A thousand confused thoughts passed through the Frenchmans mind
first he thought of killing it with a bullet from his gun but he saw
there was not enough distance between them for him to take proper aim
the shot would miss the mark And if it were to wakethe thought
made his limbs rigid He listened to his own heart beating in the
midst of the silence and cursed the too violent pulsations which the
flow of blood brought on fearing to disturb that sleep which allowed
him time to think of some means of escape
Twice he placed his hand on his scimiter intending to cut off the
head of his enemy but the difficulty of cutting the stiff short hair
compelled him to abandon this daring project To miss would be to die
for CERTAIN he thought he preferred the chances of fair fight and
made up his mind to wait till morning the morning did not leave him
long to wait
He could now examine the panther at ease its muzzle was smeared with
blood
Shes had a good dinner he thought without troubling himself as to
whether her feast might have been on human flesh She wont be hungry
when she gets up
It was a female The fur on her belly and flanks was glistening white
many small marks like velvet formed beautiful bracelets round her
feet her sinuous tail was also white ending with black rings the
overpart of her dress yellow like burnished gold very lissome and
soft had the characteristic blotches in the form of rosettes which
distinguish the panther from every other feline species
This tranquil and formidable hostess snored in an attitude as graceful
as that of a cat lying on a cushion Her bloodstained paws nervous
and well armed were stretched out before her face which rested upon
them and from which radiated her straight slender whiskers like
threads of silver
If she had been like that in a cage the Provencal would doubtless
have admired the grace of the animal and the vigorous contrasts of
vivid color which gave her robe an imperial splendor but just then
his sight was troubled by her sinister appearance
The presence of the panther even asleep could not fail to produce
the effect which the magnetic eyes of the serpent are said to have on
the nightingale
For a moment the courage of the soldier began to fail before this
danger though no doubt it would have risen at the mouth of a cannon
charged with shell Nevertheless a bold thought brought daylight to
his soul and sealed up the source of the cold sweat which sprang forth
on his brow Like men driven to bay who defy death and offer their
body to the smiter so he seeing in this merely a tragic episode
resolved to play his part with honor to the last
The day before yesterday the Arabs would have killed me perhaps he
said so considering himself as good as dead already he waited
bravely with excited curiosity the awakening of his enemy
When the sun appeared the panther suddenly opened her eyes then she
put out her paws with energy as if to stretch them and get rid of
cramp At last she yawned showing the formidable apparatus of her
teeth and pointed tongue rough as a file
A regular petite maitresse thought the Frenchman seeing her roll
herself about so softly and coquettishly She licked off the blood
which stained her paws and muzzle and scratched her head with
reiterated gestures full of prettiness All right make a little
toilet the Frenchman said to himself beginning to recover his
gaiety with his courage well say good morning to each other
presently and he seized the small short dagger which he had taken
from the Maugrabins
At this moment the panther turned her head toward the man and looked
at him fixedly without moving The rigidity of her metallic eyes and
their insupportable luster made him shudder especially when the
animal walked towards him But he looked at her caressingly staring
into her eyes in order to magnetize her and let her come quite close
to him then with a movement both gentle and amorous as though he
were caressing the most beautiful of women he passed his hand over
her whole body from the head to the tail scratching the flexible
vertebrae which divided the panthers yellow back The animal waved
her tail voluptuously and her eyes grew gentle and when for the
third time the Frenchman accomplished this interesting flattery she
gave forth one of those purrings by which cats express their pleasure
but this murmur issued from a throat so powerful and so deep that it
resounded through the cave like the last vibrations of an organ in a
church The man understanding the importance of his caresses
redoubled them in such a way as to surprise and stupefy his imperious
courtesan When he felt sure of having extinguished the ferocity of
his capricious companion whose hunger had so fortunately been
satisfied the day before he got up to go out of the cave the panther
let him go out but when he had reached the summit of the hill she
sprang with the lightness of a sparrow hopping from twig to twig and
rubbed herself against his legs putting up her back after the manner
of all the race of cats Then regarding her guest with eyes whose
glare had softened a little she gave vent to that wild cry which
naturalists compare to the grating of a saw
She is exacting said the Frenchman smilingly
He was bold enough to play with her ears he caressed her belly and
scratched her head as hard as he could When he saw that he was
successful he tickled her skull with the point of his dagger
watching for the right moment to kill her but the hardness of her
bones made him tremble for his success
The sultana of the desert showed herself gracious to her slave she
lifted her head stretched out her neck and manifested her delight by
the tranquility of her attitude It suddenly occurred to the soldier
that to kill this savage princess with one blow he must poniard her in
the throat
He raised the blade when the panther satisfied no doubt laid
herself gracefully at his feet and cast up at him glances in which
in spite of their natural fierceness was mingled confusedly a kind of
good will The poor Provencal ate his dates leaning against one of
the palm trees and casting his eyes alternately on the desert in
quest of some liberator and on his terrible companion to watch her
uncertain clemency
The panther looked at the place where the date stones fell and every
time that he threw one down her eyes expressed an incredible mistrust
She examined the man with an almost commercial prudence However this
examination was favorable to him for when he had finished his meager
meal she licked his boots with her powerful rough tongue brushing off
with marvelous skill the dust gathered in the creases
Ah but when shes really hungry thought the Frenchman In spite of
the shudder this thought caused him the soldier began to measure
curiously the proportions of the panther certainly one of the most
splendid specimens of its race She was three feet high and four feet
long without counting her tail this powerful weapon rounded like a
cudgel was nearly three feet long The head large as that of a
lioness was distinguished by a rare expression of refinement The
cold cruelty of a tiger was dominant it was true but there was also
a vague resemblance to the face of a sensual woman Indeed the face
of this solitary queen had something of the gaiety of a drunken Nero
she had satiated herself with blood and she wanted to play
The soldier tried if he might walk up and down and the panther left
him free contenting herself with following him with her eyes less
like a faithful dog than a big Angora cat observing everything and
every movement of her master
When he looked around he saw by the spring the remains of his
horse the panther had dragged the carcass all that way about two
thirds of it had been devoured already The sight reassured him
It was easy to explain the panthers absence and the respect she had
had for him while he slept The first piece of good luck emboldened
him to tempt the future and he conceived the wild hope of continuing
on good terms with the panther during the entire day neglecting no
means of taming her and remaining in her good graces
He returned to her and had the unspeakable joy of seeing her wag her
tail with an almost imperceptible movement at his approach He sat
down then without fear by her side and they began to play together
he took her paws and muzzle pulled her ears rolled her over on her
back stroked her warm delicate flanks She let him do what ever he
liked and when he began to stroke the hair on her feet she drew her
claws in carefully
The man keeping the dagger in one hand thought to plunge it into the
belly of the too confiding panther but he was afraid that he would be
immediately strangled in her last convulsive struggle besides he
felt in his heart a sort of remorse which bid him respect a creature
that had done him no harm He seemed to have found a friend in a
boundless desert half unconsciously he thought of his first
sweetheart whom he had nicknamed Mignonne by way of contrast
because she was so atrociously jealous that all the time of their love
he was in fear of the knife with which she had always threatened him
This memory of his early days suggested to him the idea of making the
young panther answer to this name now that he began to admire with
less terror her swiftness suppleness and softness Toward the end of
the day he had familiarized himself with his perilous position he now
almost liked the painfulness of it At last his companion had got into
the habit of looking up at him whenever he cried in a falsetto voice
Mignonne
At the setting of the sun Mignonne gave several times running a
profound melancholy cry Shes been well brought up said the
lighthearted soldier she says her prayers But this mental joke
only occurred to him when he noticed what a pacific attitude his
companion remained in Come ma petite blonde Ill let you go to bed
first he said to her counting on the activity of his own legs to
run away as quickly as possible directly she was asleep and seek
another shelter for the night
The soldier waited with impatience the hour of his flight and when it
had arrived he walked vigorously in the direction of the Nile but
hardly had he made a quarter of a league in the sand when he heard the
panther bounding after him crying with that sawlike cry more
dreadful even than the sound of her leaping
Ah he said then shes taken a fancy to me she has never met
anyone before and it is really quite flattering to have her first
love That instant the man fell into one of those movable quicksands
so terrible to travelers and from which it is impossible to save
oneself Feeling himself caught he gave a shriek of alarm the
panther seized him with her teeth by the collar and springing
vigorously backwards drew him as if by magic out of the whirling
sand
Ah Mignonne cried the soldier caressing her enthusiastically
were bound together for life and death but no jokes mind and he
retraced his steps
From that time the desert seemed inhabited It contained a being to
whom the man could talk and whose ferocity was rendered gentle by
him though he could not explain to himself the reason for their
strange friendship Great as was the soldiers desire to stay upon
guard he slept
On awakening he could not find Mignonne he mounted the hill and in
the distance saw her springing toward him after the habit of these
animals who cannot run on account of the extreme flexibility of the
vertebral column Mignonne arrived her jaws covered with blood she
received the wonted caress of her companion showing with much purring
how happy it made her Her eyes full of languor turned still more
gently than the day before toward the Provencal who talked to her as
one would to a tame animal
Ah mademoiselle you are a nice girl arent you Just look at that
So we like to be made much of dont we Arent you ashamed of
yourself So you have been eating some Arab or other have you That
doesnt matter Theyre animals just the same as you are but dont
you take to eating Frenchmen or I shant like you any longer
She played like a dog with its master letting herself be rolled over
knocked about and stroked alternately sometimes she herself would
provoke the soldier putting up her paw with a soliciting gesture
Some days passed in this manner This companionship permitted the
Provencal to appreciate the sublime beauty of the desert now that he
had a living thing to think about alternations of fear and quiet and
plenty to eat his mind became filled with contrast and his life began
to be diversified
Solitude revealed to him all her secrets and enveloped him in her
delights He discovered in the rising and setting of the sun sights
unknown to the world He knew what it was to tremble when he heard
over his head the hiss of a birds wing so rarely did they pass or
when he saw the clouds changing and many colored travelers melt one
into another He studied in the night time the effect of the moon upon
the ocean of sand where the simoom made waves swift of movement and
rapid in their change He lived the life of the Eastern day marveling
at its wonderful pomp then after having reveled in the sight of a
hurricane over the plain where the whirling sands made red dry mists
and deathbearing clouds he would welcome the night with joy for
then fell the healthful freshness of the stars and he listened to
imaginary music in the skies Then solitude taught him to unroll the
treasures of dreams He passed whole hours in remembering mere
nothings and comparing his present life with his past
At last he grew passionately fond of the panther for some sort of
affection was a necessity
Whether it was that his will powerfully projected had modified the
character of his companion or whether because she found abundant
food in her predatory excursions in the desert she respected the
mans life he began to fear for it no longer seeing her so well
tamed
He devoted the greater part of his time to sleep but he was obliged
to watch like a spider in its web that the moment of his deliverance
might not escape him if anyone should pass the line marked by the
horizon He had sacrificed his shirt to make a flag with which he
hung at the top of a palm tree whose foliage he had torn off Taught
by necessity he found the means of keeping it spread out by
fastening it with little sticks for the wind might not be blowing at
the moment when the passing traveler was looking through the desert
It was during the long hours when he had abandoned hope that he
amused himself with the panther He had come to learn the different
inflections of her voice the expressions of her eyes he had studied
the capricious patterns of all the rosettes which marked the gold of
her robe Mignonne was not even angry when he took hold of the tuft at
the end of her tail to count her rings those graceful ornaments which
glittered in the sun like jewelry It gave him pleasure to contemplate
the supple fine outlines of her form the whiteness of her belly the
graceful pose of her head But it was especially when she was playing
that he felt most pleasure in looking at her the agility and youthful
lightness of her movements were a continual surprise to him he
wondered at the supple way in which she jumped and climbed washed
herself and arranged her fur crouched down and prepared to spring
However rapid her spring might be however slippery the stone she was
on she would always stop short at the word Mignonne
One day in a bright midday sun an enormous bird coursed through the
air The man left his panther to look at his new guest but after
waiting a moment the deserted sultana growled deeply
My goodness I do believe shes jealous he cried seeing her eyes
become hard again the soul of Virginie has passed into her body
thats certain
The eagle disappeared into the air while the soldier admired the
curved contour of the panther
But there was such youth and grace in her form she was beautiful as a
woman the blond fur of her robe mingled well with the delicate tints
of faint white which marked her flanks
The profuse light cast down by the sun made this living gold these
russet markings to burn in a way to give them an indefinable
attraction
The man and the panther looked at one another with a look full of
meaning the coquette quivered when she felt her friend stroke her
head her eyes flashed like lightningthen she shut them tightly
She has a soul he said looking at the stillness of this queen of
the sands golden like them white like them solitary and burning
like them
Well she said I have read your plea in favor of beasts but how
did two so well adapted to understand each other end
Ah well you see they ended as all great passions do endby a
misunderstanding For some reason ONE suspects the other of treason
they dont come to an explanation through pride and quarrel and part
from sheer obstinacy
Yet sometimes at the best moments a single word or a look is enough
but anyhow go on with your story
Its horribly difficult but you will understand after what the old
villain told me over his champagne He saidI dont know if I hurt
her but she turned round as if enraged and with her sharp teeth
caught hold of my leggently I daresay but I thinking she would
devour me plunged my dagger into her throat She rolled over giving
a cry that froze my heart and I saw her dying still looking at me
without anger I would have given all the worldmy cross even which
I had not got thento have brought her to life again It was as
though I had murdered a real person and the soldiers who had seen my
flag and were come to my assistance found me in tears
Well sir he said after a moment of silence since then I have
been in war in Germany in Spain in Russia in France Ive certainly
carried my carcase about a good deal but never have I seen anything
like the desert Ah yes it is very beautiful
What did you feel there I asked him
Oh that cant be described young man Besides I am not always
regretting my palm trees and my panther I should have to be very
melancholy for that In the desert you see there is everything and
nothing
Yes but explain
Well he said with an impatient gesture it is God without
mankind
