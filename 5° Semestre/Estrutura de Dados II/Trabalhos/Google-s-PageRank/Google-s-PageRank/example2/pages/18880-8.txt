savage men are hewing their path and those whose lips are shouting in
honor of their criminal supreme commander are inflicting untold tortures
and infamies upon defenseless people upon aged men and women upon
captives and wounded
Let these horrible crimes be entered upon the Book of Fate with eternal
letters These crimes shall awake within us one sole burning wishto
wrest the arms from the barbarous hands to deprive Germany forever of
that brutal power upon whose achievement she has concentrated all her
thoughts Already the seed of national pride and of hatred widely sown
by her has awakened a magnificent growth This hatred may spread like
wildfire among other nations and then will resound the voice of those
blinded by wrath the voice of those demanding vengeance the voice of
those repudiating everything great and beautiful among the creations of
the German genius to the rejoicing and for the benefit of all mankind
But let us remember the disastrous results of such a coursefor the
black crimes thrust by Germany upon herself by drawing the sword and
the outrages in which she has indulged herself while drunk with victory
are the inevitable fruits of the darkness which she has voluntarily
entered At present she is pursuing this course encouraged even by her
poets scientists and social and political leaders
Her adversaries carrying peace and victory to their peoples shall
indeed be inspired solely by holy motives

Russia in Literature
By British Men of Letters
The following address signed by a number of distinguished
writers in Great Britain and intended for publication in
Russia appeared in The London Times on Dec 23 1914
To Our Colleagues in Russia
At this moment when your countrymen and ours are alike facing death for
the deliverance of Europe we Englishmen of letters take the opportunity
of uttering to you feelings which have been in our hearts for many
years You yourselves perhaps hardly realize what an inspiration
Englishmen of the last two generations have found in your literature
Many a writer among us can still call back from ten or twenty or thirty
years ago the feeling of delight and almost of bewilderment with which
he read his first Russian novel Perhaps it was Virgin Soil or
Fathers and Sons perhaps War and Peace or Anna Karenina perhaps
Crime and Punishment or The Idiot perhaps again it was the work
of some author still living But many of us then felt as our poet Keats
felt on first reading Homer
like some watcher of the skies
When a new planet swims into his ken
It was a strange world that opened before us a world full of foreign
names which we could neither pronounce nor remember of foreign customs
and articles of daily life which we could not understand Yet beneath
all the strangeness there was a deep sense of having discovered a new
home of meeting our unknown kindred of finding expressed great burdens
of thought which had lain unspoken and halfrealized at the depths of
our own minds The books were very different one from another sometimes
they were mutually hostile yet we found in all some quality which made
them one and made us at one with them We will not attempt to analyze
that quality It was perhaps in part that deep Russian tenderness
which never derides but only pities and respects the unfortunate in
part that simple Russian sincerity which never fears to see the truth
and to express it but most of all it was that everpresent sense of
spiritual values behind the material and utterly transcending the
material which enables Russian literature to move so naturally in a
world of the spirit where there are no barriers between the ages and
the nations but all mankind is one
And they call you barbarians The fact should make us ask again what
we mean by the words culture and civilization Critics used once to
call our Shakespeare a barbarian and might equally well give the same
name to Aeschylus or Isaiah All poets and prophets are in this sense
barbarians that they will not measure life by the standards of external
culture And it is at a time like this when the material civilization
of Europe seems to have betrayed us and shown the lie at its heart that
we realize that the poets and prophets are right and that we must like
them and like your great writers once more see life with the simplicity
of the barbarian or the child if we are to regain our peace and freedom
and build up a better civilization on the ruins of this that is
crumbling
That task we trust will some day lie before us When at last our
victorious fleets and armies meet together and the allied nations of
East and West set themselves to restore the wellbeing of many millions
of ruined homes France and Great Britain will assuredly bring their
large contributions of goodwill and wisdom but your country will have
something to contribute which is all its own It is not only because of
your valor in war and your achievements in art science and letters
that we rejoice to have you for allies and friends it is for some
quality in Russia herself something both profound and humane of which
these achievements are the outcome and the expression
You like us entered upon this war to defend a weak and threatened
nation which trusted you against the lawless aggression of a strong
military power you like us have continued it as a war of selfdefense
and selfemancipation When the end comes and we can breathe again we
will help one another to remember the spirit in which our allied nations
took up arms and thus work together in a changed Europe to protect the
weak to liberate the oppressed and to bring eventual healing to the
wounds inflicted on suffering mankind both by ourselves and our enemies
With assurances of our friendship and gratitude we sign ourselves

Russia and Europes War
By Paul Vinogradoff
The following letter to The London Times by Paul Vinogradoff
Corpus Professor of Jurisprudence at Oxford University
appeared on Sept 14 1914 Prof Vinogradoff was invited to
return to Russia a few years ago to become a Minister of
State but on going there he found the Ministry not liberal
enough for him and returned to Oxford
To the Editor of The Times
SIR I hope you may see your way to publish the following somewhat
lengthy statement on one of the burning questions of the day
In this time of crisis when the clash of ideas seems as fierce as the
struggle of the hosts it is the duty of those who possess authentic
information on one or the other point in dispute to speak out firmly and
clearly I should like to contribute some observations on German and
Russian conceptions in matters of culture I base my claim to be heard
on the fact that I have had the privilege of being closely connected
with Russian German and English life As a Russian Liberal who had to
give up an honorable position at home for the sake of his opinions I
can hardly be suspected of subserviency to the Russian bureaucracy
I am struck by the insistence with which the Germans represent their
cause in this worldwide struggle as the cause of civilization as opposed
to Muscovite barbarism and I am not sure that some of my English
friends do not feel reluctant to side with the subjects of the Czar
against the countrymen of Harnack and Eucken One would like to know
however since when did the Germans take up this attitude They were not
so squeamish during the war of emancipation which gave birth to
modern Germany At that time the people of Eastern Prussia were
anxiously waiting for the appearance of Cossacks as heralds of the
Russian hosts who were to emancipate them from the yoke of Napoleon Did
the Prussians and Austrians reflect on the humiliation of an alliance
with the Muscovites and on the superiority of the code civil when the
Russian Guard at Kulm stood like a rock against the desperate onslaughts
of Vandamme Perhaps by this time the inhabitants of Berlin have
obliterated the basrelief in the Alley of Victories representing
Prince William of Prussia the future victor of Sedan seeking safety
within the square of the Kaluga regiment Russian blood has flowed in
numberless battles in the cause of the Germans and Austrians The
present Armageddon might perhaps have been avoided if Emperor Nicholas
I had left the Hapsburg monarchy to its own resources in 1849 and had
not unwisely crushed the independence of Hungary Within our memory the
benevolent neutrality of Russia guarded Germany in 1870 from an attack
in the rear by its opponents of Sadowa Are all such facts to be
explained away on the ground that the despised Muscovites may be
occasionally useful as gun meat but are guilty of sacrilege if they
take up a stand against German taskmasters in shining armor The older
generations of Germany had not yet reached that comfortable conclusion
The last recommendation which the founder of the German Empire made on
his deathbed to his grandson was to keep on good terms with that Russia
which is now proclaimed to be a debased mixture of Byzantine Tartar
and Muscovite abominations
Fortunately the course of history does not depend on the frantic
exaggerations of partisans The world is not a classroom in which docile
nations are distributed according to the arbitrary standards of German
pedagogues Europe has admired the patriotic resistance of the Spanish
Tyrolese and Russian peasants to the enlightened tyranny of Napoleon
There are other standards of culture besides proficiency in research and
aptitude for systematic work The massacre of Louvain the hideous
brutality of the Germansas regards noncombatantsto mention only one
or two of the appalling occurrences of these last weekshave thrown a
lurid light on the real character of twentiethcentury German culture
By their fruits ye shall know them said our Lord and the saying
which He aimed at the Scribes and Pharisees of His time is indeed
applicable to the proud votaries of German civilization today Nobody
wishes to underestimate the services rendered by the German people to
the cause of European progress but those who have known Germany during
the years following on the achievements of 1870 have watched with dismay
the growth of that arrogant conceit which the Greeks called ubris The
coldblooded barbarity advocated by Bernhardi the cynical view taken of
international treaties and of the obligations of honor by the German
Chancellorthese things reveal a spirit which it would be difficult
indeed to describe as a sign of progress
One of the effects of such a frame of mind is to strike the victim of it
with blindness This symptom has been manifest in the stupendous
blunders of German diplomacy The successors of Bismarck have alienated
their natural allies such as Italy and Rumania and have driven England
into this war against the evident intentions of English Radicals But
the Germans have misconceived even more important thingsthey set out
on their adventure in the belief that England would be embarrassed by
civil war and unable to take any effective part in the fray and they
had to learn something which all their writers had not taught themthat
there is a nations spirit watching over Englands safety and greatness
a spirit at whose mighty call all party differences and racial strifes
fade into insignificance In the same way they had reckoned on the
unpreparedness of Russia in consequence of internal dissensions and
administrative weakness without taking heed of the love of all Russians
for Russia of their devotion to the longsuffering giant whose life is
throbbing in their veins The Germans expected to encounter raw and
sluggish troops under intriguing timeservers and military Hamlets whose
native hue of resolution had been sicklied oer with the pale cast of
thought Instead of that they were confronted with soldiers of the same
type as those whom Frederick the Great and Napoleon admired led at last
by chiefs worthy of their men And behind these soldiers they discovered
a nation Do they realize now what a force they have awakened Do they
understand that a steadfast indomitable resolution despising all
theatrical display is moving Russias hosts Even if the Russian
Generals had proved mediocre even if many disappointing days had been
in store the nation would not belie its history It has seen more than
one conquering army go down before itthe Tartars and the Poles the
Swedes of Charles XII the Prussians of Frederick the Great the Grand
Army of Napoleon were not less formidable than the Kaisers army but
the task of mastering a united Russia proved too much for each one of
them The Germans counted on the fratricidal feud between Poles and
Russians on the resentment of the Jews on the Mohammedan sympathies
with Turkey and so forth They had to learn too late that the Jews had
rallied around the country of their hearths and that the best of them
cannot believe that Russia will continue to deny them the measure of
justice and humanity which the leaders of Russian thought have long
acknowledged to be due to them More important still the Germans have
read the Grand Dukes appeal to the Poles and must have heard of the
manner in which it was received in Poland of the enthusiastic support
offered to the Russian cause If nothing else came of this great
historical upheaval but the reconciliation of the Russians and their
noble kinsmen the Poles the sacrifices which this crisis demands would
not be too great a price to pay for the result
But the hour of trial has revealed other things It has appealed to the
best feelings and the best elements of the Russian Nation It has
brought out in a striking manner the fundamental tendency of Russian
political life and the essence of Russian culture which so many people
have been unable to perceive on account of the chaff on the surface
Russia has been going through a painful crisis In the words of the
Manifesto of Oct 17 30 1905 the outward casing of her
administration had become too narrow and oppressive for the development
of society with its growing needs its altered perceptions of rights and
duties its changed relations between Government and people The result
was that deepseated political malaise which made itself felt during the
Japanese war when society at large refused to take any interest in the
fate of the army the feverish rush for liberties after the defeat
the subsequent reign of reaction and repression which has cast such a
gloom over Russian life during these last years But the effort of the
national struggle had dwarfed all these misunderstandings and
misfortunes as in Great Britain the call of the common fatherland has
dwarfed the dispute between Unionists and Home Rulers Russian parties
have not renounced their aspirations Russian Liberals in particular
believe in selfgovernment and the rule of law as firmly as ever But
they have realized as one man that this war is not an adventure
engineered by unscrupulous ambition but a decisive struggle for
independence and existence and they are glad to be arrayed in close
ranks with their opponents from the Conservative side A friend a
Liberal like myself writes to me from Moscow It is a great
unforgettable time we are happy to be all at one And from the ranks
of the most unfortunate of Russias children from the haunts of the
political exiles in Paris comes the news that Bourtzeff one of the
most prominent among the revolutionary leaders has addressed an appeal
to his comrades urging them to stand by their country to the utmost of
their power
I may add that whatever may have been the shortcomings and the blunders
of the Russian Government it is a blessing in this decisive crisis that
Russians should have a firmly knit organization and a traditional centre
of authority in the power of the Czar The present Emperor stands as the
national leader not in the histrionic attitude of a war lord but in the
quiet dignity of his office He has said and done the right thing and
his subjects will follow him to a man We are sure he will remember in
the hour of victory the unstinted devotion and sacrifices of all the
nationalities and parties of his vast empire It is our firm conviction
that the sad tale of reaction and oppression is at an end in Russia and
that our country will issue from this momentous crisis with the insight
and strength required for the constructive and progressive statesmanship
of which it stands in need
Apart from the details of political and social reform is the
regeneration of Russia a boon or a peril to European civilization The
declamations of the Germans have been as misleading in this respect as
in all others The masterworks of Russian literature are accessible in
translation nowadays and the cheap taunts of men like Bernhardi recoil
on their own heads A nation represented by Pushkin Turgeneff Tolstoy
Dostoyevsky in literature by Kramskoy Verestchagin Repin Glinka
Moussorgsky Tchaikovsky in art by Mendeleiff Metchnikoff Pavloff in
science by Kluchevsky and Solovieff in history need not be ashamed to
enter the lists in an international competition for the prizes of
culture But the German historians ought to have taught their pupils
that in the world of ideas it is not such competitions that are
important A nation handicapped by its geography may have to start later
in the field and yet her performance may be relatively better than that
of her more favored neighbors It is astonishing to read German
diatribes about Russian backwardness when one remembers that as recently
as fifty years ago Austria and Prussia were living under a regime which
can hardly be considered more enlightened than the present rule in
Russia The Italians in Lombardy and Venice have still a vivid
recollection of Austrian jails and as for Prussian militarism one
need not go further than the exploits of the Zabern garrisons to
illustrate its meaning This being so it is not particularly to be
wondered at that the eastern neighbor of Austria and Prussia has
followed to some extent on the same lines
But the general direction of Russias evolution is not doubtful Western
students of her history might do well instead of sedulously collecting
damaging evidence to pay some attention to the building up of Russias
universities the persistent efforts of the Zemstvos the independence
and the zeal of the press German scholars should read Hertzens vivid
description of the idealists of the forties And what about the
history of the emancipation of the serfs or of the regeneration of the
judicature The reforms of the sixties are a household word in Russia
and surely they are one of the noblest efforts ever made by a nation in
the direction of moral improvement
Looking somewhat deeper what right have the Germans to speak of their
cultural ideals as superior to those of the Russian people They deride
the superstitions of the mujikh as if tapers and genuflexions were the
principal matters of popular religion Those who have studied the
Russian people without prejudice know better than that Read Selma
Lagerloefs touching description of Russian pilgrims in Palestine She
the Protestant has understood the true significance of the religious
impulse which leads these poor men to the Holy Land and which draws
them to the numberless churches of the vast country These simple people
cling to the belief that there is something else in Gods world besides
toil and greed they flock toward the light and find in it the
justification of their human craving for peace and mercy For the
Russian people have the Christian virtues of patience in suffering
their pity for the poor and oppressed are more than occasional
manifestations of individual feelingthey are deeply rooted in national
psychology This frame of mind has been scorned as fit for slaves It is
indeed a case where the learning of philosophers is put to shame by the
insight of the simpleminded Conquerors should remember that the
greatest victories in history have been won by the unarmedby the
Christian confessors whom the Emperors sent to the lions by the old
believers of Russia who went to Siberia and to the flames for their
unyielding faith by the Russian serfs who preserved their human dignity
and social cohesion in spite of the exactions of their masters by the
Italians Poles and Jews when they were trampled under foot by their
rulers It is such a victory of the spirit that Tolstoy had in mind when
he preached his gospel of nonresistance and I do not think even a
German on the war path would be blind enough to suppose that Tolstoys
message came from a craven soul The orientation of the socalled
intelligent class in Russiathat is the educated middle class which
is much more numerous and influential than people supposeis somewhat
different of course It is Western in this sense that it is imbued
with current European ideas as to politics economics and law
It has to a certain extent lost the simple faith and religious fervor of
the peasants but the keynote of popular ideals has been faithfully
preserved by this class It is still characteristically humanitarian in
its view of the world and in its aims A book like that of Gen von
Bernhardi would be impossible in Russia If anybody were to publish it
it would not only fall flat but earn for its author the reputation of a
bloodhound Many deeds of cruelty and brutality happen of course in
Russia but no writer of any standing would dream of building up a
theory of violence in vindication of a claim to culture It may be said
in fact that the leaders of Russian public opinion are pacific
cosmopolitan and humanitarian to a fault The mystic philosopher
Vladimir Solovieff used to dream of the union of the churches with the
Pope as the spiritual head and democracy in the Russian sense as the
broad basis of the rejuvenated Christendom Dostoyevsky a writer most
sensitive to the claims of nationality in Russia defined the ideal of
the Russians in a celebrated speech as the embodiment of a universally
humanitarian type These are extremes but characteristic extremes
pointing to the trend of national thought Russia is so huge and so
strong that material power has ceased to be attractive to her thinkers
But we need not yet retire into the desert and deliver ourselves to be
bound hand and foot by civilized Germans Russia also wields a sworda
charmed sword blunt in an unrighteous cause but sharp enough in the
defense of right and freedom And this war is indeed our
Befreiungskrieg The Slavs must have their chance in the history of
the world and the date of their coming of age will mark a new departure
in the growth of civilization
Yours truly

Russian Appeal for the Poles
By A Konovalov of the Russian Duma
A Letter to the Russkia Vedomosti No 231 P 2 Oct 8 1914
The population of Poland has been forced to experience the first
horrible onslaught of the wrathful enemy All points within the sphere
of the German offensive offer a picture of utter desolation The people
are fleeing in horror before the advancing enemy leaving their homes
and their property to sure destruction An uninterrupted line of arson
fire shines on the sorrowful path of the exiles Their fields have been
devastated and furrowed by the trenches their animals have been taken
away their savings have been wasted and all their chattels destroyed
The prosperity of millions has been destroyed and men have been turned
into homeless beggars without a morsel of bread
The flight of these people is beyond description One cannot fail to
realize the stupefying horrors of such a deep and overwhelming national
calamity The strokes of fate have come down upon the people of Poland
with a most merciless cruelty Shall we gaze upon these horrors with
indifference Can the Russian people remain neutral witnesses of the
sufferings and privations thrust upon the population of the devastated
country
The Russians are making heavy sacrifices for the war but in these
historic days we must speed up our energies still more we must double
and treble our sacrifices Let us not forget that despite all our
sacrifices despite all our sorrow and alarm we are not deprived of
peaceful work we have not been drawn into destruction as the people of
Poland have been Without further delay we have to hasten to their aid
A widely organized social aid must be brought to the fleeing people We
must provide them with shelter and food These victims are flocking to
the central provinces of Russia to Moscow and they must be assisted up
to the time when they shall be able to return to their country It is
necessary to ascertain the degree of their distress and to help to
provide them with the necessities of life in places already cleared from
the enemy by the aggressiveness of the Russian Army
Of course the main duty in the regaining of the prosperity of Poland
lies with the Government Only the Government is able to stand the
expense of millions required for this task only the State through its
legislative organs is capable of creating the social economic and
political conditions making possible the reconstruction of the
civilization of Poland But we also owe a duty of help a sacred duty of
immediate sympathy to those stricken with disaster
To carry out our task we need funds In submitting this problem to the
Russian people in calling upon it for the solution of this tremendous
and pressing issue as far as possible I herewith forward my little
contribution of 10000 rubles for aid to the people of Poland suffering
from war
A KONOVALOV
Member of the Duma

NoteKonovalovs appeal met with a most generous response Not only
individuals and charitable associations came forward with funds and
food but a large number of Russian cities organized permanent aid
committees for the benefit of the war victims in Poland Street and
housetohouse collections were organized and considerable funds have
