BEYOND THE FRONTIER
CHAPTER I
AT THE HOME OF HUGO CHEVET
It was early autumn for the clusters of grapes above me were already
purple and the forest leaves were tinged with red And yet the air
was soft and the golden bars of sun flickered down on the work in my
lap through the laced branches of the trellis The work was but a
pretense for I had fled the house to escape the voice of Monsieur
Cassion who was still urging my uncle to accompany him on his journey
into the wilderness They sat in the great room before the fireplace
drinking and I had heard enough already to tell me there was
treachery on foot against the Sieur de la Salle To be sure it was
nothing to me a girl knowing naught of such intrigue yet I had not
forgotten the day three years before when this La Salle with others
of his company had halted before the Ursuline convent and the
sisters bade them welcome for the night Twas my part to help serve
and he had stroked my hair in tenderness I had sung to them and
watched his face in the firelight as he listened Never would I forget
that face nor believe evil of such a man No not from the lips of
Cassion nor even from the governor La Barre
I recalled it all now as I sat there in the silence pretending to
work how we watched them embark in their canoes and disappear the
Indian paddlers bending to their task and Monsieur la Salle
standing bareheaded as he waved farewell Beyond him was the dark
face of one they called De Tonty and in the first boat a mere boy
lifted his ragged hat I know not why but the memory of that lad was
clearer than all those others for he had met me in the hall and we
had talked long in the great window ere the sister came and took me
away So I remembered him and his name Rene de Artigny And in all
those years I heard no more Into the black wilderness they swept and
were lost to those of us at home in New France
No doubt there were those who knewFrontenac Bigot those who ruled
over us at Quebecbut twas not a matter supposed to interest a girl
and so no word came to me Once I asked my Uncle Chevet and he
replied in anger with only a few sentences bidding me hold my tongue
yet he said enough so that I knew the Sieur de la Salle lived and had
built a fort far away and was buying furs of the Indians It was this
that brought jealousy and hatred Once Monsieur Cassion came and
stopped with us and as I waited on him and Uncle Chevet I caught
words which told me that Frontenac was La Salles friend and would
listen to no charges brought against him They talked of a new
governor yet I learned but little for Cassion attempted to kiss me
and I would wait on him no more
Then Frontenac was recalled to France and La Barre was governor How
pleased my Uncle Chevet was when the news came and he rapped the
table with his glass and exclaimed Ah but now we will pluck out the
claws of this Sieur de la Salle and send him where he belongs But
he would explain nothing until a week later Cassion came up the
river in his canoe with Indian paddlers and stopped to hold
conference The man treated me with much gallantry so that I
questioned him and he seemed happy to answer that La Barre had
already dispatched a party under Chevalier de Baugis of the Kings
Dragoons to take command of La Salles Fort St Louis in the Illinois
country La Salle had returned and was already at Quebec but Cassion
grinned as he boasted that the new governor would not even give him
audience Bah I despised the man yet I lingered beside him and thus
learned that La Salles party consisted of but two voyageurs and
the young Sieur de Artigny I was glad enough when he went away
though I gave him my hand to kiss and waved to him bravely at the
landing And now he was back again bearing a message from La Barre
and seeking volunteers for some western voyage of profit Twas of no
interest to me unless my uncle joined in the enterprise yet I was
kind enough for he brought with him word of the governors ball at
Quebec and had won the pledge of Chevet to take me there with him I
could be gracious to him for that and it was on my gown I worked as
the two planned and talked in secret What they did was nothing to me
nowall my thought was on the ball What would you I was seventeen
The grape trellis ran down toward the river landing and from where I
sat in the cool shadow I could see the broad water gleaming in the
sun Suddenly as my eyes uplifted the dark outline of a canoe swept
into the vista and the splashing paddles turned the prow inward
toward our landing I did not move although I watched with interest
for it was not the time of year for Indian traders and these were
white men I could see those at the paddles voyageurs with gay
cloths about their heads but the one in the stern wore a hat the
brim concealing his face and a blue coat I knew not who it could be
until the prow touched the bank and he stepped ashore Then I knew
and bent low over my sewing as though I had seen nothing although my
heart beat fast Through lowered lashes I saw him give brief order to
the men and then advance toward the house alone Ah but this was not
the slender laughingeyed boy of three years before The wilderness
had made of him a mana soldier He paused an instant to gaze about
and held his hat in his hand the sun touching his tanned cheeks and
flecking the long lightcolored hair He looked strong and manly in
his tightly buttoned jacket a knife at his belt a rifle grasped
within one hand There was a sternness to his face too although it
lit up in a smile as the searching eyes caught glimpse of my white
dress in the cool shade of the grape arbor Hat still in hand he came
toward me but I only bent the lower as though I knew nothing of his
approach and had no interest other than my work
Mademoiselle he said gently pardon me but is not this the home
of Hugo Chevet the fur trader
I looked up into his face and bowed as he swept the earth with his
hat seeing at a glance that he had no remembrance of me
Yes I answered If you seek him rap on the door beyond
Tis not so much Chevet I seek he said showing no inclination to
pass me but one whom I understood was his guestMonsieur Francois
Cassion
The man is here I answered quickly yet unable to conceal my
surprise but you will find him no friend to Sieur de la Salle
Ah and he stared at me intently In the name of the saints what
is the meaning of this You know me then
I bowed yet my eyes remained hidden
I knew you once as Monsieurs friend I said almost regretting my
indiscretion and have been told you travel in his company
You knew me once he laughed Surely that cannot be for never
would I be likely to forget I challenge you Mademoiselle to speak my
name
The Sieur Rene de Artigny Monsieur
By my faith the witch is right and yet in all this New France I
know scarce a maid Nay look up there is naught to fear from me and
I would see if memory be not new born Saint Giles surely tis true
I have seen those eyes before why the name is on my tongue yet
fails me lost in the wilderness I pray you mercy Mademoiselle
You have memory of the face you say
Ay the witchery of it tis like a haunting spirit
Which did not haunt long I warrant I am Adele la Chesnayne
Monsieur
He stepped back his eyes on mine questioningly For an instant I
believed the name even brought no familiar sound then his face
brightened and his eyes smiled as his lips echoed the words
Adele la Chesnayne Ay now I know Why tis no less than a miracle
It was a child I thought of under that namea slender browneyed
girl as blithesome as a bird No I had not forgotten only the magic
of three years has made of you a woman Again and again have I
questioned in Montreal and Quebec but no one seemed to know At the
convent they said your father fell in Indian skirmish
Yes ever since then I have lived here with my uncle Hugo Chevet
Here he looked about as though the dreariness of it was first
noticed Alone Is there no other woman
I shook my head but no longer looked at him for fear he might see
the tears in my eyes
I am the housekeeper Monsieur There was nothing else for me In
France I am told my fathers people were well born but this is not
France and there was no choice Besides I was but a child of
fourteen
And seventeen now Mademoiselle and he took my hand gallantly
Pardon if I have asked questions which bring pain I can understand
much for in Montreal I heard tales of this Hugo Chevet
He is rough a woodsman I defended yet not unkind to me You will
speak him fair
He laughed his eyes sparkling with merriment
No fear of my neglecting all courtesy for I come beseeching a favor
I have learned the lesson of when the soft speech wins more than the
iron hand And this other the Commissaire Cassionis he a bird of
the same plumage
I made a little gesture and glanced back at the closed door
Oh no he is the court courtier to stab with words not deeds
Chevet is rough of speech and hard of hand but he fights in the
open Cassion has a double tongue and one never knows him I glanced
up into his sobered face He is a friend of La Barre
So tis said and has been chosen by the governor to bear message to
De Baugis in the Illinois country I seek passage in his company
You I thought you were of the party of Sieur de la Salle
I am he answered honestly yet Cassion will need a guide and
there is none save myself in all New France who has ever made that
journey Twill be well for him to listen to my plan And why not We
do not fight the orders of the governor we obey and wait Monsieur
de la Salle will tell his story to the King
The King to Louis
Ay twill not be the first time he has had audience and already he
is at sea We can wait and laugh at this Cassion over his useless
journey
But hehe is treacherous Monsieur
He laughed as though the words amused
To one who has lived as I amid savages treachery is an old story
The Commissaire will not find me asleep We will serve each other and
let it go at that Ah we are to be interrupted
He straightened up facing the door and I turned confronting my uncle
as he emerged in advance He was a burly man with irongray hair and
face reddened by outofdoors and he stopped in surprise at sight of
a stranger his eyes hardening with suspicion
And who is this with whom you converse so privately Adele he
questioned brusquely a young popinjay new to these parts I
venture
De Artigny stepped between us smiling in good humor
My call was upon you Monsieur Chevet and not the young lady he
said quietly enough yet with a tone to the voice I merely asked her
if I had found the right place and if Monsieur the Commissaire
Cassion was still your guest
And what may I ask might be your business with the Commissaire
Cassion asked the latter pressing past Chevet yet bowing with a
semblance of politeness scarcely in accord with the studied insolence
of his words I have no remembrance of your face
Then Monsieur Cassion is not observant returned the younger man
pleasantly as I accompanied the Sieur de la Salle in his attempt to
have audience with the governor
Ah the word of surprise exploded from the lips Sacre tis
true My faith what difference clothes make I mistook you for a
courier du bois
I am the Sieur Rene de Artigny
Lieutenant of La Salles
Scarcely that Monsieur but a comrade for three years I have been
with his party and was chosen by him for this mission
Cassion laughed chucking the gloomyfaced Chevet in the side as
though he would give point to a good joke
And little the trip hither has profited either master or man I
warrant La Barre does not sell New France to every adventurer
Monsieur de la Salle found different reception in Quebec than when
Frontenac ruled this colony Where went the furstealer
To whom do you refer
To whom Heaven help us Chevet the man would play nice with words
Well let it go my young cock and answer me
You mean the Sieur de la Salle
To be sure I called him no worse than I have heard La Barre speak
They say he has left Quebec what more know you
Tis no secret Monsieur replied De Artigny quietly enough
although there was a flash in his eyes as they met mine The Sieur
de la Salle has sailed for France
France Bah you jest there has been no ship outward bound
The Breton paused at St Roche held by the fog When the fog
lifted there was a new passenger aboard By dawn the Indian paddlers
had me landed in Quebec
Does La Barre know
Faith I could not tell you that as he has not honored me with
audience
Cassion strode back and forth his face dark with passion It was not
pleasant news he had been told and it was plain enough he understood
the meaning
By the saints he exclaimed Tis a sly fox to break through our
guard so easily Ay and twill give him a month to whisper his lies
to Louis before La Barre can forward a report But sacre my young
chanticleer surely you are not here to bring me this bit of news You
sought me you said Well for what purpose
In peace Monsieur Because I have served Sieur de la Salle loyally
is no reason why we should be enemies We are both the Kings men and
may work together The word has come to me that you head a party for
the Illinois with instructions for De Baugis at Fort St Louis Is
this true
Cassion bowed coldly waiting to discover how much more his questioner
knew
Ah then I am right thus far Well Monsieur twas on that account I
came to volunteer as guide
You Twould be treachery
Oh no our interests are the same so far as the journey goes I
would reach St Louis so would you Because we may have different
ends in view different causes to serve has naught to do with the
trail thither There is not a man who knows the way as well as I Four
times have I traveled it and I am not a savage MonsieurI am a
gentleman of France
And you pledge your word
I pledge my wordto guide you safe to Fort St Louis Once there I
am comrade to Sieur de la Salle
Bah I care not who you comrade with once you serve my purpose I
take your offer and if you play me false
Restrain your threats Monsieur Cassion A quarrel will get us
nowhere You have my word of honor tis enough Who will compose the
party
Cassion hesitated yet seemed to realize the uselessness of deceit
A dozen or more soldiers of the Regiment of Picardy some couriers
du bois and the Indian paddlers There will be four boats
You go by the Ottawa and the lakes
Such were my orders
Tis less fatiguing although a longer journey and the time of
departure
Cassion laughed as he turned slightly and bowed to me
We leave Quebec before dawn Tuesday he said gaily It is my wish
to enjoy once more the follies of civilization before plunging into
the wilderness The Governor permits that we remain to his ball
Mademoiselle la Chesnayne does me the honor of being my guest on that
occasion
I Monsieur I exclaimed in surprise at his boastful words Twas
my uncle who proposed
Tut tut what of that he interrupted in no way discomposed It is
my request which opens the golden gates The good Hugo here but looks
on at a frivolity for which he cares nothing Tis the young who
dance And you Monsieur de Artigny am I to meet you there also or
perchance later at the boat landing
The younger man seemed slow in response but across Cassions shoulder
our eyes met I know not what he saw in the glance of mine for I gave
no sign yet his face brightened and his words were carelessly
spoken
At the ball Monsieur Tis three years since I have danced to
measure but it will be a joy to look on and thus keep company with
Monsieur Chevet Nor shall I fail you at the boats until then
Messieurs and he bowed hat in hand and to you Mademoiselle
adieu
We watched him go down the grape arbor to the canoe and no one spoke
but Cassion
Pouf he thinks well of himself that young cockerel and twill
likely be my part to clip his spurs Still tis good policy to have
him with us for tis a long journey What say you Chevet
That he is one to watch answered my uncle gruffly I trust none of
La Salles brood
No nor I for the matter of that but I am willing to pit my brains
against the best of them Francois Cassion is not likely to be caught
asleep my good Hugo
He turned about and glanced questioningly into my face
And so Mademoiselle it did not altogether please you to be my guest
at the ball Perchance you preferred some other gallant
The sunlight flickering through the leaves rested on his face and
brought out the mottled skin of dissipation the thin line of his
cruel lips the insolent stare of his eyes I felt myself shrink
dreading he might touch me yet dominating all else was the thought of
De Artignythe message of his glance the secret meaning of his
pledgethe knowledge that he would be there So I smiled and made
light of his suspicion
It was but surprise Monsieur I said gaily for I had not dreamed
of such an honor Tis my wish to go see I have been working on a
new gown and now I must work the faster
I swept him a curtsey smiling to myself at the expression of his
face and before he could speak had disappeared within Bah I would
escape those eyes and be alone to dream
CHAPTER II
THE CHOICE OF A HUSBAND
It was just before dark when Monsieur Cassion left us and I watched
him go gladly enough hidden behind the shade of my window He had
been talking for an hour with Chevet in the room below I could hear
the rattle of glasses as though they drank and the unpleasant
arrogance of his voice although no words reached me clearly I cared
little what he said although I wondered at his purpose in being
there and what object he might have in this long converse with my
uncle Yet I was not sent for and no doubt it was some conference
over furs of no great interest The two were in some scheme I knew to
gain advantage over Sieur de la Salle and were much elated now that
La Barre held power but that was nothing for a girl to understand so
I worked on with busy fingers my mind not forgetful of the young
Sieur de Artigny
It was not that I already loved him yet ever since girlhood the
memory of him had remained in my thought and in those years since I
had met so few young men that the image left on my imagination had
never faded Indeed it had been kept alive by the very animosity
which my uncle cherished against Monsieur de la Salle The real cause
of his bitterness outside of trade rivalry I never clearly
understood but he was ever seeking every breath of gossip from that
distant camp of adventurers and angrily commenting thereon Again and
again I overheard him conspiring with others in a vain effort to
influence Frontenac to withdraw his support of that distant
expedition and it was this mutual enmity which first brought Cassion
to our cabin
With Frontenacs removal and the appointment of La Barre as
Governor the hopes of La Salles enemies revived and when
Cassions smooth tongue won him a place as Commissaire all concerned
became more bold and confident in their planning I knew little of
it yet sufficient to keep the remembrance of those adventures
fresh in my mind and never did they recur to me without yielding me
vision of the ardent young face of De Artigny as he waved me adieu
from the canoe Often in those years of silence did I dream of him
amid the faroff wildernessthe idle dreaming of a girl whose own
heart was yet a mysteryand many a night I sat at my window
gazing out upon the broad river shimmering in the moonlight
wondering at those wilderness mysteries among which he lived
Yet only once in all those years had I heard mention of his name
Twas but a rumor floating back to us of how La Salle had reached the
mouth of a great river flowing into the South Sea and among the few
who accompanied him was De Artigny I remember yet how strangely my
heart throbbed as I heard the brief tale retold and someone read the
names from a slip of paper Chevet sat by the open fire listening his
pipe in his mouth his eyes scowling at the news suddenly he blurted
out De Artigny say you In the name of the fiend tis not the old
captain No no Chevet a voice answered testily Sieur Louis de
Artigny has not stepped foot on ground these ten years tis his brat
Rene who serves this freebooter though tis like enough the father
hath money in the venture And they fell to discussing sneering at
the value of the discovery while I slipped unnoticed from the room
Chevet did not return to the house after Monsieur Cassions canoe had
disappeared I saw him walking back and forth along the river bank
smoking and seemingly thinking out some problem Nor did he appear
until I had the evening meal ready and called to him down the arbor
He was always gruff and bearish enough when we were alone seldom
speaking indeed except to give utterance to some order but this
night he appeared even more morose and silent than his wont not so
much as looking at me as he took seat and began to eat No doubt
Cassion had brought ill news or else the appearance of De Artigny had
served to arouse all his old animosity toward La Salle It was little
to me however and I had learned to ignore his moods so I took my
own place silently and paid no heed to the scowl with which he
surveyed me across the table No doubt my very indifference fanned his
discontent but I remained ignorant of it until he burst out
savagely
And so you know this young cockerel do you You know him and never
told me
I looked up in surprise scarce comprehending the unexpected
outburst
You mean the Sieur de Artigny
Ay Dont play with me I mean Louis de Artignys brat Bah he may
fool Cassion with his soft words but not Hugo Chevet I know the lot
of them this many year and no ward of mine will have aught to do with
the brood either young or old You hear that Adele When I hate I
hate and I have reason enough to hate that name and all who bear it
Where before did you ever meet this popinjay
At the convent three years ago La Salle rested there overnight and
young De Artigny was of the party He was but a boy then
He came here today to see you
No never I protested I doubt if he even had the memory of me
until I told him who I was Surely he explained clearly why he came
He eyed me fiercely his face full of suspicion his great hand
gripping the knife
Tis well for you if that be true he said gruffly but I have no
faith in the lads words He is here as La Salles spy and so I
told Cassion though the only honor he did me was to laugh at my
warning Let him spy he said and I will play at the same
game tis little enough he will learn and we shall need his
guidance Ay and he may be right but I want nothing to do with
the fellow Cassion may give him place in his boats if he will but
never again shall he set foot on my land nor have speech with
you You mark my words Mademoiselle
I felt the color flame into my cheeks and knew my eyes darkened with
anger yet made effort to control my speech
Yes Monsieur I am your ward and have always been obedient yet this
Sieur de Artigny seems a pleasant spoken young man and surely tis no
crime that he serves the Sieur de la Salle
Is it not he burst forth striking the table with his fist Know
you not I would be rich but for that fur stealer By right those
should be my furs he sends here in trade There will be another tale
to tell soon now that La Barre hath the reins of power and this De
Artignybah What care I for that young cockerelbut I hate the
brood Listen girl I pay my debts it was this hand that broke Louis
de Artigny and has kept him to his bed for ten years past Yet even
that does not wipe out the score between us Tis no odds to you what
was the cause but while I live I hate So you have my orders you
will speak no more with this De Artigny
Tis not like I shall have opportunity
I will see to that The fool looked at you in a way that made me long
to grip his throat nor do I like your answer yet twill be well for
you to mark my words
Yes Monsieur
Oh youre sweet enough with words I have heard you before and
found you a sly minxwhen my back was turnedbut this time it is not
I alone who will watch your actions I have pledged you a husband
I got to my feet staring at him the indignant words stifled in my
throat He laughed coarsely and resumed his meal
A husband Monsieur You have pledged me
Ay why not You are seventeen and tis my place to see you well
settled
But I have no wish to marry Monsieur I protested There is no man
for whom I care
He shrugged his shoulders indifferently and laughed
Pooh if I waited for that no doubt you would pick out some cockerel
without so much as a spur to his heel Tis my choice not yours for
I know the world and the man you need Monsieur Cassion has asked me
to favor him and I think well of it
Cassion Surely you would not wed me to that creature
He pushed back his chair regarding me with scowling eyes
And where is there a better Sacre do you think yourself a queen
to choose Tis rare luck you have such an offer Monsieur Cassion is
going to be a great man in this New France already he has the
Governors ear and a commission with a tidy sum to his credit in
Quebec What more could any girl desire in a husband
But Monsieur I do not love him I do not trust the man
Pah He burst into a laugh rising from the table Before I could
draw back he had gripped me by the arm Enough of that young lady
He is my choice and that settles it Love who ever heard of love
nowadays Ah I see you dream already of the young gallant De
Artigny Well little good that will do you Why what is he a mere
ragged adventurer without a sou to his name a prowling wolf of the
forest the follower of a discredited fur thief But enough of this I
have told you my will and you obey Tomorrow we go to Quebec to the
Governors ball and when Monsieur Cassion returns from his mission
you will marry himyou understand
The tears were in my eyes blotting out his threatening face yet
there was naught to do but answer
Yes Monsieur
And this De Artigny if the fellow ever dares come near you again
Ill crush his white throat between my fingers
Yes Monsieur
To your room then and think over all I have said You have never
found me full of idle threats I warrant
No Monsieur
I drew my arm from his grasp feeling it tingle with pain where his
fingers had crushed the flesh and crept up the narrow stairs glad
enough to get away and be alone I had never loved Chevet but he had
taught me to fear him for more than once had I experienced his
brutality and physical power To him I was but a chattel an
incumbrance He had assumed charge of me because the law so ordained
but I had found nothing in his nature on which I could rely for
sympathy I was his sisters child yet no more to him than some
Indian waif More he was honest about it To his mind he did well by
me in thus finding me a husband I sank on my knees and hid my face
shuddering at the thought of the sacrifice demanded Cassion never
before had the man appeared so despicable His face his manner swept
through my memory in review I had scarcely considered him before
except as a disagreeable presence to be avoided as much as possible
But now in the silence the growing darkness of that little chamber
with Chevets threat echoing in my ears he came to me in clear
visionI saw his dullblue cowardly eyes his little waxed mustache
