puzzle has a real difficulty latent under it to which Socrates will
endeavour to find a reply The difficulty is the origin of knowledge
He has heard from priests and priestesses and from the poet Pindar of
an immortal soul which is born again and again in successive periods of
existence returning into this world when she has paid the penalty of
ancient crime and having wandered over all places of the upper and
under world and seen and known all things at one time or other is by
association out of one thing capable of recovering all For nature is
of one kindred and every soul has a seed or germ which may be developed
into all knowledge The existence of this latent knowledge is further
proved by the interrogation of one of Menos slaves who in the skilful
hands of Socrates is made to acknowledge some elementary relations
of geometrical figures The theorem that the square of the diagonal
is double the square of the sidethat famous discovery of primitive
mathematics in honour of which the legendary Pythagoras is said to
have sacrificed a hecatombis elicited from him The first step in the
process of teaching has made him conscious of his own ignorance He
has had the torpedos shock given him and is the better for the
operation But whence had the uneducated man this knowledge He had
never learnt geometry in this world nor was it born with him he must
therefore have had it when he was not a man And as he always either was
or was not a man he must have always had it Compare Phaedo
After Socrates has given this specimen of the true nature of teaching
the original question of the teachableness of virtue is renewed Again
he professes a desire to know what virtue is first But he is willing
to argue the question as mathematicians say under an hypothesis He
will assume that if virtue is knowledge then virtue can be taught
This was the stage of the argument at which the Protagoras concluded
Socrates has no difficulty in showing that virtue is a good and
that goods whether of body or mind must be under the direction of
knowledge Upon the assumption just made then virtue is teachable But
where are the teachers There are none to be found This is extremely
discouraging Virtue is no sooner discovered to be teachable than the
discovery follows that it is not taught Virtue therefore is and is
not teachable
In this dilemma an appeal is made to Anytus a respectable and
welltodo citizen of the old school and a family friend of Meno
who happens to be present He is asked whether Meno shall go to the
Sophists and be taught The suggestion throws him into a rage To
whom then shall Meno go asks Socrates To any Athenian gentlemanto
the great Athenian statesmen of past times Socrates replies here as
elsewhere Laches Prot that Themistocles Pericles and other great
men had sons to whom they would surely if they could have done so
have imparted their own political wisdom but no one ever heard that
these sons of theirs were remarkable for anything except riding and
wrestling and similar accomplishments Anytus is angry at the imputation
which is cast on his favourite statesmen and on a class to which he
supposes himself to belong he breaks off with a significant hint The
mention of another opportunity of talking with him and the suggestion
that Meno may do the Athenian people a service by pacifying him are
evident allusions to the trial of Socrates
Socrates returns to the consideration of the question whether virtue is
teachable which was denied on the ground that there are no teachers of
it for the Sophists are bad teachers and the rest of the world do
not profess to teach But there is another point which we failed to
observe and in which Gorgias has never instructed Meno nor Prodicus
Socrates This is the nature of right opinion For virtue may be under
the guidance of right opinion as well as of knowledge and right opinion
is for practical purposes as good as knowledge but is incapable of
being taught and is also liable like the images of Daedalus to walk
off because not bound by the tie of the cause This is the sort of
instinct which is possessed by statesmen who are not wise or knowing
persons but only inspired or divine The higher virtue which is
identical with knowledge is an ideal only If the statesman had this
knowledge and could teach what he knew he would be like Tiresias in
the world belowhe alone has wisdom but the rest flit like shadows
This Dialogue is an attempt to answer the question Can virtue be
taught No one would either ask or answer such a question in modern
times But in the age of Socrates it was only by an effort that the mind
could rise to a general notion of virtue as distinct from the particular
virtues of courage liberality and the like And when a hazy conception
of this ideal was attained it was only by a further effort that the
question of the teachableness of virtue could be resolved
The answer which is given by Plato is paradoxical enough and seems
rather intended to stimulate than to satisfy enquiry Virtue is
knowledge and therefore virtue can be taught But virtue is not taught
and therefore in this higher and ideal sense there is no virtue and no
knowledge The teaching of the Sophists is confessedly inadequate and
Meno who is their pupil is ignorant of the very nature of general
terms He can only produce out of their armoury the sophism that you
can neither enquire into what you know nor into what you do not know
to which Socrates replies by his theory of reminiscence
To the doctrine that virtue is knowledge Plato has been constantly
tending in the previous Dialogues But the new truth is no sooner found
than it vanishes away If there is knowledge there must be teachers
and where are the teachers There is no knowledge in the higher sense
of systematic connected reasoned knowledge such as may one day be
attained and such as Plato himself seems to see in some far off vision
of a single science And there are no teachers in the higher sense of
the word that is to say no real teachers who will arouse the spirit
of enquiry in their pupils and not merely instruct them in rhetoric or
impart to them readymade information for a fee of one or of fifty
drachms Plato is desirous of deepening the notion of education and
therefore he asserts the paradox that there are no educators This
paradox though different in form is not really different from the
remark which is often made in modern times by those who would depreciate
either the methods of education commonly employed or the standard
attainedthat there is no true education among us
There remains still a possibility which must not be overlooked Even
if there be no true knowledge as is proved by the wretched state of
education there may be right opinion which is a sort of guessing
or divination resting on no knowledge of causes and incommunicable to
others This is the gift which our statesmen have as is proved by the
circumstance that they are unable to impart their knowledge to their
sons Those who are possessed of it cannot be said to be men of science
or philosophers but they are inspired and divine
There may be some trace of irony in this curious passage which forms
the concluding portion of the Dialogue But Plato certainly does not
mean to intimate that the supernatural or divine is the true basis of
human life To him knowledge if only attainable in this world is of
all things the most divine Yet like other philosophers he is willing
to admit that probability is the guide of life Butlers Analogy
and he is at the same time desirous of contrasting the wisdom which
governs the world with a higher wisdom There are many instincts
judgments and anticipations of the human mind which cannot be reduced
to rule and of which the grounds cannot always be given in words A
person may have some skill or latent experience which he is able to use
himself and is yet unable to teach others because he has no principles
and is incapable of collecting or arranging his ideas He has practice
but not theory art but not science This is a true fact of psychology
which is recognized by Plato in this passage But he is far from
saying as some have imagined that inspiration or divine grace is to be
regarded as higher than knowledge He would not have preferred the poet
or man of action to the philosopher or the virtue of custom to the
virtue based upon ideas
Also here as in the Ion and Phaedrus Plato appears to acknowledge an
unreasoning element in the higher nature of man The philosopher only
has knowledge and yet the statesman and the poet are inspired There
may be a sort of irony in regarding in this way the gifts of genius But
there is no reason to suppose that he is deriding them any more than he
is deriding the phenomena of love or of enthusiasm in the Symposium or
of oracles in the Apology or of divine intimations when he is speaking
of the daemonium of Socrates He recognizes the lower form of right
opinion as well as the higher one of science in the spirit of one who
desires to include in his philosophy every aspect of human life just
as he recognizes the existence of popular opinion as a fact and the
Sophists as the expression of it
This Dialogue contains the first intimation of the doctrine of
reminiscence and of the immortality of the soul The proof is very
slight even slighter than in the Phaedo and Republic Because men had
abstract ideas in a previous state they must have always had them and
their souls therefore must have always existed For they must always
have been either men or not men The fallacy of the latter words is
transparent And Socrates himself appears to be conscious of their
weakness for he adds immediately afterwards I have said some things
of which I am not altogether confident Compare Phaedo It may be
observed however that the fanciful notion of preexistence is combined
with a true but partial view of the origin and unity of knowledge
and of the association of ideas Knowledge is prior to any particular
knowledge and exists not in the previous state of the individual but
of the race It is potential not actual and can only be appropriated
by strenuous exertion
The idealism of Plato is here presented in a less developed form than in
the Phaedo and Phaedrus Nothing is said of the preexistence of ideas
of justice temperance and the like Nor is Socrates positive of
anything but the duty of enquiry The doctrine of reminiscence too is
explained more in accordance with fact and experience as arising out of
the affinities of nature ate tes thuseos oles suggenous ouses Modern
philosophy says that all things in nature are dependent on one another
the ancient philosopher had the same truth latent in his mind when
he affirmed that out of one thing all the rest may be recovered The
subjective was converted by him into an objective the mental phenomenon
of the association of ideas compare Phaedo became a real chain of
existences The germs of two valuable principles of education may also
be gathered from the words of priests and priestesses 1 that
true knowledge is a knowledge of causes compare Aristotles theory of
episteme and 2 that the process of learning consists not in what is
brought to the learner but in what is drawn out of him
Some lesser points of the dialogue may be noted such as 1 the
acute observation that Meno prefers the familiar definition which is
embellished with poetical language to the better and truer one or 2
the shrewd reflection which may admit of an application to modern
as well as to ancient teachers that the Sophists having made large
fortunes this must surely be a criterion of their powers of teaching
for that no man could get a living by shoemaking who was not a good
shoemaker or 3 the remark conveyed almost in a word that the verbal
sceptic is saved the labour of thought and enquiry ouden dei to toiouto
zeteseos Characteristic also of the temper of the Socratic enquiry
is 4 the proposal to discuss the teachableness of virtue under
an hypothesis after the manner of the mathematicians and 5 the
repetition of the favourite doctrine which occurs so frequently in
the earlier and more Socratic Dialogues and gives a colour to all
of themthat mankind only desire evil through ignorance 6 the
experiment of eliciting from the slaveboy the mathematical truth which
is latent in him and 7 the remark that he is all the better for
knowing his ignorance
The character of Meno like that of Critias has no relation to the
actual circumstances of his life Plato is silent about his treachery
to the ten thousand Greeks which Xenophon has recorded as he is also
silent about the crimes of Critias He is a Thessalian Alcibiades
rich and luxuriousa spoilt child of fortune and is described as the
hereditary friend of the great king Like Alcibiades he is inspired
with an ardent desire of knowledge and is equally willing to learn of
Socrates and of the Sophists He may be regarded as standing in the same
relation to Gorgias as Hippocrates in the Protagoras to the other
great Sophist He is the sophisticated youth on whom Socrates tries his
crossexamining powers just as in the Charmides the Lysis and
the Euthydemus ingenuous boyhood is made the subject of a similar
experiment He is treated by Socrates in a halfplayful manner suited to
his character at the same time he appears not quite to understand the
process to which he is being subjected For he is exhibited as ignorant
of the very elements of dialectics in which the Sophists have failed
to instruct their disciple His definition of virtue as the power and
desire of attaining things honourable like the first definition
of justice in the Republic is taken from a poet His answers have a
sophistical ring and at the same time show the sophistical incapacity
to grasp a general notion
Anytus is the type of the narrowminded man of the world who is
indignant at innovation and equally detests the popular teacher and
the true philosopher He seems like Aristophanes to regard the new
opinions whether of Socrates or the Sophists as fatal to Athenian
greatness He is of the same class as Callicles in the Gorgias but of
a different variety the immoral and sophistical doctrines of Callicles
are not attributed to him The moderation with which he is described is
remarkable if he be the accuser of Socrates as is apparently indicated
by his parting words Perhaps Plato may have been desirous of showing
that the accusation of Socrates was not to be attributed to badness or
malevolence but rather to a tendency in mens minds Or he may have
been regardless of the historical truth of the characters of his
dialogue as in the case of Meno and Critias Like Chaerephon Apol
the real Anytus was a democrat and had joined Thrasybulus in the
conflict with the thirty
The Protagoras arrived at a sort of hypothetical conclusion that if
virtue is knowledge it can be taught In the Euthydemus Socrates
himself offered an example of the manner in which the true teacher
may draw out the mind of youth this was in contrast to the quibbling
follies of the Sophists In the Meno the subject is more developed the
foundations of the enquiry are laid deeper and the nature of knowledge
is more distinctly explained There is a progression by antagonism of
two opposite aspects of philosophy But at the moment when we approach
nearest the truth doubles upon us and passes out of our reach We seem
to find that the ideal of knowledge is irreconcilable with experience
In human life there is indeed the profession of knowledge but right
opinion is our actual guide There is another sort of progress from the
general notions of Socrates who asked simply what is friendship
what is temperance what is courage as in the Lysis Charmides
Laches to the transcendentalism of Plato who in the second stage of
his philosophy sought to find the nature of knowledge in a prior and
future state of existence
The difficulty in framing general notions which has appeared in this and
in all the previous Dialogues recurs in the Gorgias and Theaetetus as
well as in the Republic In the Gorgias too the statesmen reappear but
in stronger opposition to the philosopher They are no longer allowed to
have a divine insight but though acknowledged to have been clever men
and good speakers are denounced as blind leaders of the blind The
doctrine of the immortality of the soul is also carried further being
made the foundation not only of a theory of knowledge but of a doctrine
of rewards and punishments In the Republic the relation of knowledge
to virtue is described in a manner more consistent with modern
distinctions The existence of the virtues without the possession
of knowledge in the higher or philosophical sense is admitted to be
possible Right opinion is again introduced in the Theaetetus as
an account of knowledge but is rejected on the ground that it is
irrational as here because it is not bound by the tie of the cause
and also because the conception of false opinion is given up as
hopeless The doctrines of Plato are necessarily different at different
times of his life as new distinctions are realized or new stages of
thought attained by him We are not therefore justified in order to
take away the appearance of inconsistency in attributing to him hidden
meanings or remote allusions
There are no external criteria by which we can determine the date of the
Meno There is no reason to suppose that any of the Dialogues of Plato
were written before the death of Socrates the Meno which appears to be
one of the earliest of them is proved to have been of a later date by
the allusion of Anytus
We cannot argue that Plato was more likely to have written as he has
done of Meno before than after his miserable death for we have already
seen in the examples of Charmides and Critias that the characters in
Plato are very far from resembling the same characters in history The
repulsive picture which is given of him in the Anabasis of Xenophon
where he also appears as the friend of Aristippus and a fair youth
having lovers has no other trait of likeness to the Meno of Plato
The place of the Meno in the series is doubtfully indicated by internal
evidence The main character of the Dialogue is Socrates but to the
general definitions of Socrates is added the Platonic doctrine of
reminiscence The problems of virtue and knowledge have been discussed
in the Lysis Laches Charmides and Protagoras the puzzle about
knowing and learning has already appeared in the Euthydemus The
doctrines of immortality and preexistence are carried further in the
Phaedrus and Phaedo the distinction between opinion and knowledge is
more fully developed in the Theaetetus The lessons of Prodicus whom he
facetiously calls his master are still running in the mind of Socrates
Unlike the later Platonic Dialogues the Meno arrives at no conclusion
Hence we are led to place the Dialogue at some point of time later than
the Protagoras and earlier than the Phaedrus and Gorgias The place
which is assigned to it in this work is due mainly to the desire to
bring together in a single volume all the Dialogues which contain
allusions to the trial and death of Socrates
ON THE IDEAS OF PLATO
Platos doctrine of ideas has attained an imaginary clearness and
definiteness which is not to be found in his own writings The popular
account of them is partly derived from one or two passages in his
Dialogues interpreted without regard to their poetical environment It
is due also to the misunderstanding of him by the Aristotelian school
and the erroneous notion has been further narrowed and has become fixed
by the realism of the schoolmen This popular view of the Platonic ideas
may be summed up in some such formula as the following Truth consists
not in particulars but in universals which have a place in the mind of
God or in some faroff heaven These were revealed to men in a former
state of existence and are recovered by reminiscence anamnesis or
association from sensible things The sensible things are not
realities but shadows only in relation to the truth These unmeaning
propositions are hardly suspected to be a caricature of a great theory
of knowledge which Plato in various ways and under many figures of
speech is seeking to unfold Poetry has been converted into dogma and
it is not remarked that the Platonic ideas are to be found only in about
a third of Platos writings and are not confined to him The forms which
they assume are numerous and if taken literally inconsistent with one
another At one time we are in the clouds of mythology at another among
the abstractions of mathematics or metaphysics we pass imperceptibly
from one to the other Reason and fancy are mingled in the same
passage The ideas are sometimes described as many coextensive with
the universals of sense and also with the first principles of ethics or
again they are absorbed into the single idea of good and subordinated
to it They are not more certain than facts but they are equally
certain Phaedo They are both personal and impersonal They are
abstract terms they are also the causes of things and they are even
transformed into the demons or spirits by whose help God made the world
And the idea of good Republic may without violence be converted into
the Supreme Being who because He was good created all things Tim
It would be a mistake to try and reconcile these differing modes of
thought They are not to be regarded seriously as having a distinct
meaning They are parables prophecies myths symbols revelations
aspirations after an unknown world They derive their origin from a deep
religious and contemplative feeling and also from an observation of
curious mental phenomena They gather up the elements of the previous
philosophies which they put together in a new form Their great
diversity shows the tentative character of early endeavours to think
They have not yet settled down into a single system Plato uses them
though he also criticises them he acknowledges that both he and others
are always talking about them especially about the Idea of Good and
that they are not peculiar to himself Phaedo Republic Soph But in
his later writings he seems to have laid aside the old forms of them
As he proceeds he makes for himself new modes of expression more akin to
the Aristotelian logic
Yet amid all these varieties and incongruities there is a common
meaning or spirit which pervades his writings both those in which he
treats of the ideas and those in which he is silent about them This is
the spirit of idealism which in the history of philosophy has had many
names and taken many forms and has in a measure influenced those
who seemed to be most averse to it It has often been charged with
inconsistency and fancifulness and yet has had an elevating effect on
human nature and has exercised a wonderful charm and interest over
a few spirits who have been lost in the thought of it It has been
banished again and again but has always returned It has attempted to
leave the earth and soar heavenwards but soon has found that only
in experience could any solid foundation of knowledge be laid It has
degenerated into pantheism but has again emerged No other knowledge
has given an equal stimulus to the mind It is the science of sciences
which are also ideas and under either aspect require to be defined
They can only be thought of in due proportion when conceived in relation
to one another They are the glasses through which the kingdoms of
science are seen but at a distance All the greatest minds except when
living in an age of reaction against them have unconsciously fallen
under their power
The account of the Platonic ideas in the Meno is the simplest and
clearest and we shall best illustrate their nature by giving this first
and then comparing the manner in which they are described elsewhere
eg in the Phaedrus Phaedo Republic to which may be added the
criticism of them in the Parmenides the personal form which is
attributed to them in the Timaeus the logical character which they
assume in the Sophist and Philebus and the allusion to them in the
Laws In the Cratylus they dawn upon him with the freshness of a
newlydiscovered thought
The Meno goes back to a former state of existence in which men did and
suffered good and evil and received the reward or punishment of them
until their sin was purged away and they were allowed to return to
earth This is a tradition of the olden time to which priests and poets
bear witness The souls of men returning to earth bring back a latent
memory of ideas which were known to them in a former state The
recollection is awakened into life and consciousness by the sight of the
things which resemble them on earth The soul evidently possesses such
innate ideas before she has had time to acquire them This is proved by
an experiment tried on one of Menos slaves from whom Socrates elicits
truths of arithmetic and geometry which he had never learned in this
world He must therefore have brought them with him from another
The notion of a previous state of existence is found in the verses
of Empedocles and in the fragments of Heracleitus It was the natural
answer to two questions Whence came the soul What is the origin of
evil and prevailed far and wide in the east It found its way into
Hellas probably through the medium of Orphic and Pythagorean rites and
mysteries It was easier to think of a former than of a future life
because such a life has really existed for the race though not for the
individual and all men come into the world if not trailing clouds of
glory at any rate able to enter into the inheritance of the past In
the Phaedrus as well as in the Meno it is this former rather than a
future life on which Plato is disposed to dwell There the Gods and men
following in their train go forth to contemplate the heavens and are
borne round in the revolutions of them There they see the divine forms
of justice temperance and the like in their unchangeable beauty but
not without an effort more than human The soul of man is likened to
a charioteer and two steeds one mortal the other immortal The
charioteer and the mortal steed are in fierce conflict at length the
animal principle is finally overpowered though not extinguished by the
combined energies of the passionate and rational elements This is one
of those passages in Plato which partaking both of a philosophical
and poetical character is necessarily indistinct and inconsistent The
magnificent figure under which the nature of the soul is described has
not much to do with the popular doctrine of the ideas Yet there is one
little trait in the description which shows that they are present to
Platos mind namely the remark that the soul which had seen truths
in the form of the universal cannot again return to the nature of an
animal
In the Phaedo as in the Meno the origin of ideas is sought for in a
previous state of existence There was no time when they could have been
acquired in this life and therefore they must have been recovered from
another The process of recovery is no other than the ordinary law of
association by which in daily life the sight of one thing or person
recalls another to our minds and by which in scientific enquiry from
any part of knowledge we may be led on to infer the whole It is also
argued that ideas or rather ideals must be derived from a previous
state of existence because they are more perfect than the sensible forms
of them which are given by experience But in the Phaedo the doctrine
of ideas is subordinate to the proof of the immortality of the soul
If the soul existed in a previous state then it will exist in a future
state for a law of alternation pervades all things And If the ideas
exist then the soul exists if not not It is to be observed both
in the Meno and the Phaedo that Socrates expresses himself with
diffidence He speaks in the Phaedo of the words with which he has
comforted himself and his friends and will not be too confident that
the description which he has given of the soul and her mansions is
exactly true but he ventures to think that something of the kind is
true And in the Meno after dwelling upon the immortality of the
soul he adds Of some things which I have said I am not altogether
confident compare Apology Gorgias From this class of uncertainties
he exempts the difference between truth and appearance of which he is
absolutely convinced
In the Republic the ideas are spoken of in two ways which though not
contradictory are different In the tenth book they are represented as
the genera or general ideas under which individuals having a common name
are contained For example there is the bed which the carpenter makes
the picture of the bed which is drawn by the painter the bed existing
in nature of which God is the author Of the latter all visible beds
are only the shadows or reflections This and similar illustrations or
explanations are put forth not for their own sake or as an exposition
of Platos theory of ideas but with a view of showing that poetry and
the mimetic arts are concerned with an inferior part of the soul and a
lower kind of knowledge On the other hand in the 6th and 7th books
of the Republic we reach the highest and most perfect conception which
Plato is able to attain of the nature of knowledge The ideas are now
finally seen to be one as well as many causes as well as ideas and to
have a unity which is the idea of good and the cause of all the rest
They seem however to have lost their first aspect of universals under
which individuals are contained and to have been converted into forms
of another kind which are inconsistently regarded from the one side as
images or ideals of justice temperance holiness and the like from the
other as hypotheses or mathematical truths or principles
In the Timaeus which in the series of Platos works immediately follows
the Republic though probably written some time afterwards no mention
occurs of the doctrine of ideas Geometrical forms and arithmetical
ratios furnish the laws according to which the world is created But
though the conception of the ideas as genera or species is forgotten or
laid aside the distinction of the visible and intellectual is as
firmly maintained as ever The IDEA of good likewise disappears and is
superseded by the conception of a personal God who works according to
a final cause or principle of goodness which he himself is No doubt is
expressed by Plato either in the Timaeus or in any other dialogue of
the truths which he conceives to be the first and highest It is not the
existence of God or the idea of good which he approaches in a tentative
or hesitating manner but the investigations of physiology These he
regards not seriously as a part of philosophy but as an innocent
recreation Tim
Passing on to the Parmenides we find in that dialogue not an exposition
or defence of the doctrine of ideas but an assault upon them which is
put into the mouth of the veteran Parmenides and might be ascribed to
Aristotle himself or to one of his disciples The doctrine which is
assailed takes two or three forms but fails in any of them to escape
the dialectical difficulties which are urged against it It is admitted
that there are ideas of all things but the manner in which individuals
partake of them whether of the whole or of the part and in which
they become like them or how ideas can be either within or without
the sphere of human knowledge or how the human and divine can have any
relation to each other is held to be incapable of explanation And
yet if there are no universal ideas what becomes of philosophy
Parmenides In the Sophist the theory of ideas is spoken of as a
doctrine held not by Plato but by another sect of philosophers called
the Friends of Ideas probably the Megarians who were very distinct
from him if not opposed to him Sophist Nor in what may be termed
Platos abridgement of the history of philosophy Soph is any mention
made such as we find in the first book of Aristotles Metaphysics
of the derivation of such a theory or of any part of it from the
Pythagoreans the Eleatics the Heracleiteans or even from Socrates In
the Philebus probably one of the latest of the Platonic Dialogues
the conception of a personal or semipersonal deity expressed under the
figure of mind the king of all who is also the cause is retained The
one and many of the Phaedrus and Theaetetus is still working in the mind
of Plato and the correlation of ideas not of all with all but of
some with some is asserted and explained But they are spoken of in
a different manner and are not supposed to be recovered from a former
state of existence The metaphysical conception of truth passes into a
psychological one which is continued in the Laws and is the final
form of the Platonic philosophy so far as can be gathered from his own
writings see especially Laws In the Laws he harps once more on the
old string and returns to general notionsthese he acknowledges to
be many and yet he insists that they are also one The guardian must be
made to recognize the truth for which he has contended long ago in the
Protagoras that the virtues are four but they are also in some sense
one Laws compare Protagoras
So various and if regarded on the surface only inconsistent are the
statements of Plato respecting the doctrine of ideas If we attempted to
