MEMOIR OF COLLINS
A Bard
Who touched the tenderest notes of Pitys lyre
HAYLEY
No one can have reflected on the history of genius without being
impressed with a melancholy feeling at the obscurity in which the lives
of the poets of our country are with few exceptions involved That
they lived and wrote and died comprises nearly all that is known of
many and of others the few facts which are preserved are often
records of privations or sufferings or errors The cause of the
lamentable deficiency of materials for literary biography may without
difficulty be explained The lives of authors are seldom marked by
events of an unusual character and they rarely leave behind them the
most interesting work a writer could compose and which would embrace
nearly all the important facts in his career a History of his Books
containing the motives which produced them the various incidents
respecting their progress and a faithful account of the bitter
disappointment whether the object was fame or profit or both which
in most instances is the result of his labours Various motives deter
men from writing such a volume for though quacks and charlatans
readily become autobiographers and fill their prefaces with their
personal concerns real merit shrinks from such disgusting egotism and
flying to the opposite extreme leaves no authentic notice of their
struggles its hopes or its disappointments Nor is the history of
writers to be expected from their contemporaries because few will
venture to anticipate the judgment of posterity and mankind are usually
so isolated in self and so jealous of others that neither time nor
inclination admits of their becoming the Boswells of all those whose
productions excite admiration
If these remarks be true surprise cannot be felt though there is
abundance of cause for regret that little is known of a poet whose
merits were not appreciated until after his decease whose powers were
destroyed by a distressing malady at a period of life when literary
exertions begin to be rewarded and stimulated by popular applause
For the facts contained in the following Memoir of Collins the author
is indebted to the researches of others as his own which were very
extensive were rewarded by trifling discoveries Dr Johnsons Life is
well known but the praise of collecting every particular which industry
and zeal could glean belongs to the Rev Alexander Dyce the result of
whose inquiries may be found in his notes to Johnsons Memoir prefixed
to an edition of Collinss works which he lately edited Those notices
are now for the first time wove into a Memoir of Collins and in
leaving it to another to erect a fabric out of the materials which he
has collected instead of being himself the architect Mr Dyce has
evinced a degree of modesty which those who know him must greatly
lament
WILLIAM COLLINS was born at Chichester on the 25th of December 1721
and was baptized in the parish church of St Peter the Great alias
Subdeanery in that city on the first of the following January He was
the son of William Collins who was then the Mayor of Chichester where
he exercised the trade of a hatter and lived in a respectable manner
His mother was Elizabeth the sister of a Colonel Martyn to whose
bounty the poet was deeply indebted
Being destined for the church young Collins was admitted a scholar of
Winchester College on the 19th of January 1733 where he was educated
by Dr Burton and in 1740 he stood first on the list of scholars who
were to be received at New College No vacancy however occurred and
the circumstance is said by Johnson to have been the original misfortune
of his life He became a commoner of Queens1 whence on the 29th of
July 1741 he was elected a demy of Magdalen College During his stay
at Queens he was distinguished for genius and indolence and the few
exercises which he could be induced to write bear evident marks of both
qualities He continued at Oxford until he took his bachelors degree
and then suddenly left the University his motive as he alleged being
that he missed a fellowship for which he offered himself but it has
been assigned to his disgust at the dulness of a college life and to
his being involved in debt
On arriving in London which was either in 1743 or 1744 he became says
Johnson a literary adventurer with many projects in his head and very
little money in his pocket Collins was not without some reputation as
an author when he proposed to adopt the most uncertain and deplorable of
all professions that of literature for a subsistence Whilst at
Winchester school he wrote his Eclogues and had appeared before the
public in some verses addressed to a lady weeping at her sisters
marriage which were printed in the Gentlemans Magazine Oct 1739
when Collins was in his eighteenth year In January 1742 he published
his Eclogues under the title of Persian Eclogues2 and in
December 1743 his Verses to Sir Thomas Hanmer on his Edition of
Shakespeare appeared To neither did he affix his name but the latter
was said to be by a Gentleman of Oxford
From the time he settled in London his mind was more occupied with
literary projects than with steady application nor had poesy for which
Nature peculiarly designed him sufficient attractions to chain his
wavering disposition It is not certain whether his irresolution arose
from the annoyance of importunate debtors or from an original infirmity
of mind or from these causes united A popular writer3 has defended
Collins from the charge of irresolution on the ground that it was but
the vacillations of a mind broken and confounded and he urges that
he had exercised too constantly the highest faculties of fiction and
precipitated himself into the dreariness of real life But this
explanation does not account for the want of steadiness which prevented
Collins from accomplishing the objects he meditated His mind was
neither broken nor confounded nor had he experienced the bitter pangs
of neglect when with the buoyancy of hope and a full confidence in his
extraordinary powers he threw himself on the town at the age of
twentythree intending to live by the exercise of his talents but his
indecision was then as apparent as at any subsequent period so that in
truth the effect preceded the cause to which it has been assigned
Mankind are becoming too much accustomed to witness splendid talents and
great firmness of mind united in the same person to partake the mistaken
sympathy which so many writers evince for the follies or vices of
genius nor will it much longer tolerate the opinion that the
possession of the finest imagination or the highest poetic capacity
must necessarily be accompanied by eccentricity It may indeed be
difficult to convert a poetical temperament into a merchant or to make
the man who is destined to delight or astonish mankind by his
conceptions sit quietly over a ledger but the transition from poetry
to the composition of such works as Collins planned is by no means
unnatural and the abandonment of his views respecting them must in
justice to his memory be attributed to a different cause
The most probable reason is that these works were mere speculations to
raise money and that the idea was not encouraged by the booksellers
but if as Johnson who knew Collins well asserts his character wanted
decision and perseverance these defects may have been constitutional
and were perhaps the germs of the disease which too soon ripened into
the most frightful of human calamities Endued with a morbid
sensibility which was as ill calculated to court popularity as to bear
neglect and wanting that stoical indifference to the opinions of the
many which ought to render those who are conscious of the value of
their productions satisfied with the approbation of the few Collins was
too impatient of applause and too anxious to attain perfection to be a
voluminous writer To plan much rather than to execute any thing to
commence today an ode tomorrow a tragedy and to turn on the
following morning to a different subject was the chief occupation of
his life for several years during which time he destroyed the principal
part of the little that he wrote To a man nearly pennyless such a life
must be attended by privations and danger and he was in the hands of
bailiffs possibly not for the first time very shortly before he became
independent by the death of his maternal uncle Colonel Martyn The
result proved that his want of firmness and perseverance was natural
and did not arise from the uncertainty or narrowness of his fortune for
being rescued from imprisonment on the credit of a translation of
Aristotles Poetics which he engaged to furnish a publisher a work it
may be presumed peculiarly suited to his genius he no sooner found
himself in the possession of money by the death of his relative than he
repaid the bookseller and abandoned the translation for ever
From the commencement of his career Collins was however an object
for sympathy instead of censure and though few refuse their compassion
to the confirmed lunatic it is rare that the dreadful state of
irresolution and misery which sometimes exist for years before the
fatal catastrophe receives either pity or indulgence
In 1747 Collins published his Odes to the unrivaled splendour of a few
of which he is alone indebted for his fame but neither fame nor profit
was the immediate result and the author of the Ode on the Passions had
little reason to expect from its reception by the public that it was
destined to live as long as the passions themselves animate or distract
the world
It is uncertain at what time he undertook to publish a volume of Odes in
conjunction with Joseph Warton but the intention is placed beyond
dispute by the following letter from Warton to his brother It is
without a date but it must have been written before the publication of
Collinss Odes in 1747 and before the appearance of Dodsleys
Museum4 as it is evident the Ode to a Lady on the Death of Colonel
Ross which was inserted in that work was not then in print
DEAR TOM
You will wonder to see my name in an advertisement next week so
I thought I would apprise you of it The case was this Collins
met me in Surrey at Guildford races when I wrote out for him my
odes and he likewise communicated some of his to me and being
both in very high spirits we took courage resolved to join our
forces and to publish them immediately I flatter myself that I
shall lose no honor by this publication because I believe these
odes as they now stand are infinitely the best things I ever
wrote You will see a very pretty one of Collinss on the Death
of Colonel Ross before Tournay It is addressed to a lady who was
Rosss intimate acquaintance and who by the way is Miss Bett
Goddard Collins is not to publish the odes unless he gets ten
guineas for them I returned from Milford last night where I left
Collins with my mother and sister and he sets out today for
London I must now tell you that I have sent him your imitation
of Horaces Blandusian Fountain to be printed amongst ours and
which you shall own or not as you think proper I would not have
done this without your consent but because I think it very
poetically and correctly done and will get you honour You will
let me know what the Oxford critics say Adieu dear Tom
I am your most affectionate brother
J WARTON
Like so many of Collinss projects this was not executed but the reason
of its failure is unknown
On the death of Thomson in August 1748 Collins wrote an ode to his
memory which is no less remarkable for its beauty as a composition
than for its pathetic tenderness as a memorial of a friend
The Poets pecuniary difficulties were removed in 1749 by the death of
his maternal uncle LieutenantColonel Edmund Martyn who after
bequeathing legacies to some other relations ordered the residue of his
real and personal estate to be divided between his nephew William
Collins and his nieces Elizabeth and Anne Collins and appointed the
said Elizabeth his executrix who proved her uncles will on the 30th of
May 1749 Collinss share was it is said about two thousand pounds
and as has been already observed the money came most opportunely a
greater calamity even than poverty however shortly afterwards
counterbalanced his good fortune but the assertion of the writer in the
Gentlemans Magazine that his mental aberration arose from his having
squandered this legacy appears to be unfounded
One and but one letter of Collinss has ever been printed nor has a
careful inquiry after others been successful It is of peculiar
interest as it proves that he wrote an Ode on the Music of the Grecian
Theatre but which is unfortunately lost The honour to which he
alludes was the setting his Ode on the Passions to music
TO DR WILLIAM HAYES PROFESSOR OF MUSIC OXFORD
SIR
MR BLACKSTONE of Winchester some time since informed me of the
honour you had done me at Oxford last summer for which I return
you my sincere thanks I have another more perfect copy of the
ode which had I known your obliging design I would have
communicated to you Inform me by a line if you should think one
of my better judgment acceptable In such case I could send you
one written on a nobler subject and which though I have been
persuaded to bring it forth in London I think more calculated for
an audience in the university The subject is the Music of the
Grecian Theatre in which I have I hope naturally introduced the
various characters with which the chorus was concerned as
Adipus Medea Electra Orestes etc etc The composition too is
probably more correct as I have chosen the ancient tragedies for
my models and only copied the most affecting passages in them
In the mean time you would greatly oblige me by sending the
score of the last If you can get it written I will readily
answer the expense If you send it with a copy or two of the ode
as printed at Oxford to Mr Clarke at Winchester he will
forward it to me here I am Sir
With great respect
Your obliged humble servant
WILLIAM COLLINS
Chichester Sussex November 8 1750
P S Mr Clarke past some days here while Mr Worgan was with
me from whose friendship I hope he will receive some
advantage
Soon after this period the disease which had long threatened to destroy
Collinss intellects assumed a more decided character but for some time
the unhappy poet was the only person who was sensible of the approaching
calamity A visit to France was tried in vain and when Johnson called
upon him on his return an incident occurred which proves that Collins
wisely sought for consolation against the coming wreck of his faculties
from a higher and more certain source than mere human aid Johnson says
he paid him a visit at Islington where he was then waiting for his
sister whom he had directed to meet him there was then nothing of
disorder discernible in his mind by any but himself but he had
withdrawn from study and travelled with no other book than an English
Testament such as children carry to the school when his friend took
it into his hand out of curiosity to see what companion a man of
letters had chosen I have but one book said Collins but that is
the best
To this circumstance Hayley beautifully alludes in his epitaph on him
He in reviving reasons lucid hours
Sought on one book his troubled mind to rest
And rightly deemd the Book of God the best
A journey to Bath proved as useless as the one to France and in 1754
he went to Oxford for change of air and amusement where he stayed a
month It was on this occasion that a friend whose account of him will
be given at length saw him in a distressing state of restraint under
the walls of Merton College From the paucity of information respecting
Collins the following letters are extremely valuable and though the
statements are those of his friends they may be received without
suspicion of partiality because they are free from the high colouring
by which friendship sometimes perverts truth
The first of the letters in question was printed in the Gentlemans
Magazine
Jan 20 1781
MR URBAN
WILLIAM COLLINS the poet I was intimately acquainted with from
the time that he came to reside at Oxford He was the son of a
tradesman in the city of Chichester I think a hatter and being
sent very young to Winchester school was soon distinguished for
his early proficiency and his turn for elegant composition About
the year 1740 he came off from that seminary first upon roll5
and was entered a commoner of Queens college There no vacancy
offering for New College he remained a year or two and then was
chosen demy of Magdalen college where I think he took a degree
As he brought with him for so the whole turn of his conversation
discovered too high an opinion of his school acquisitions and a
sovereign contempt for all academic studies and discipline he
never looked with any complacency on his situation in the
university but was always complaining of the dulness of a college
life In short he threw up his demyship and going to London
commenced a man of the town spending his time in all the
dissipation of Ranelagh Vauxhall and the playhouses and was
romantic enough to suppose that his superior abilities would draw
the attention of the great world by means of whom he was to make
his fortune
In this pleasurable way of life he soon wasted his little
property and a considerable legacy left him by a maternal uncle
a colonel in the army to whom the nephew made a visit in
Flanders during the war While on his tour he wrote several
entertaining letters to his Oxford friends some of which I saw
In London I met him often and remember he lodged in a little
house with a Miss Bundy at the corner of Kingssquarecourt
Soho now a warehouse for a long time together When poverty
overtook him poor man he had too much sensibility of temper to
bear with misfortunes and so fell into a most deplorable state of
mind How he got down to Oxford I do not know but I myself saw
him under Merton wall in a very affecting situation struggling
and conveyed by force in the arms of two or three men towards
the parish of St Clement in which was a house that took in such
unhappy objects and I always understood that not long after he
died in confinement but when or where or where he was buried I
never knew
Thus was lost to the world this unfortunate person in the prime
of life without availing himself of fine abilities which
properly improved must have raised him to the top of any
profession and have rendered him a blessing to his friends and
an ornament to his country
Without books or steadiness and resolution to consult them if he
had been possessed of any he was always planning schemes for
elaborate publications which were carried no further than the
drawing up proposals for subscriptions some of which were
published and in particular as far as I remember one for a
History of the Darker Ages
He was passionately fond of music goodnatured and affable warm
in his friendships and visionary in his pursuits and as long as
I knew him very temperate in his eating and drinking He was of
moderate stature of a light and clear complexion with gray eyes
so very weak at times as hardly to bear a candle in the room and
often raising within him apprehensions of blindness
With an anecdote respecting him while he was at Magdalen
College I shall close my letter It happened one afternoon at a
tea visit that several intelligent friends were assembled at his
rooms to enjoy each others conversation when in comes a member
of a certain college6 as remarkable at that time for his brutal
disposition as for his good scholarship who though he met with a
circle of the most peaceable people in the world was determined
to quarrel and though no man said a word lifted up his foot and
kicked the teatable and all its contents to the other side of
the room Our poet though of a warm temper was so confounded at
the unexpected downfall and so astonished at the unmerited
insult that he took no notice of the aggressor but getting up
from his chair calmly he began picking up the slices of bread and
butter and the fragments of his china repeating very mildly
Invenias etiam disjecti membra poetA
I am your very humble servant
V
The next letter was found among the papers of Mr William Hymers of
Queens College Oxford who was preparing a new edition of the works of
the poet for publication when death prevented the completion of his
design
Hill Street Richmond in Surrey July 1783
SIR
Your favour of the 30th June I did not receive till yesterday
The person who has the care of my house in Bond Street expecting
me there every day did not send it to Richmond or I would have
answered sooner As you express a wish to know every particular
however trifling relating to Mr William Collins I will
endeavour so far as can be done by a letter to satisfy you
There are many little anecdotes which tell well enough in
conversation but would be tiresome for you to read or me to
write so shall pass them over I had formerly several scraps of
his poetry which were suddenly written on particular occasions
These I lent among our acquaintance who were never civil enough
to return them and being then engaged in extensive business I
forgot to ask for them and they are lost all I have remaining of
his are about twenty lines which would require a little history
to be understood being written on trifling subjects I have a few
of his letters the subjects of which are chiefly on business but
I think there are in them some flights which strongly mark his
character for which reason I preserved them There are so few of
his intimates now living that I believe I am the only one who can
give a true account of his family and connexions The principal
part of what I write is from my own knowledge or what I have
heard from his nearest relations
His father was not the manufacturer of hats but the vender He
lived in a genteel style at Chichester and I think filled the
office of mayor more than once he was pompous in his manner but
at his death he left his affairs rather embarrassed Colonel
Martyn his wifes brother greatly assisted his family and
supported Mr William Collins at the university where he stood
for a fellowship which to his great mortification he lost and
which was his reason for quitting that place at least that was
his pretext But he had other reasons he was in arrears to his
bookseller his tailor and other tradesmen But I believe a
desire to partake of the dissipation and gaiety of London was his
principal motive Colonel Martyn was at this time with his
regiment and Mr Payne a near relation who had the management
of the colonels affairs had likewise a commission to supply the
Collinses with small sums of money The colonel was the more
sparing in this order having suffered considerably by Alderman
Collins who had formerly been his agent and forgetting that his
wifes brothers cash was not his own had applied it to his own
use When Mr William Collins came from the university he called
on his cousin Payne gaily dressed and with a feather in his hat
at which his relation expressed surprise and told him his
appearance was by no means that of a young man who had not a
single guinea he could call his own This gave him great offence
but remembering his sole dependence for subsistence was in the
power of Mr Payne he concealed his resentment yet could not
refrain from speaking freely behind his back and saying he
thought him a dd dull fellow though indeed this was an
epithet he was pleased to bestow on every one who did not think as
he would have them His frequent demands for a supply obliged Mr
Payne to tell him he must pursue some other line of life for he
was sure Colonel Martyn would be displeased with him for having
done so much This resource being stopped forced him to set about
some work of which his History of the Revival of Learning was
the first and for which he printed proposals one of which I
have and took the first subscription money from many of his
particular friends the work was begun but soon stood still Both
Dr Johnson and Mr Langhorne are mistaken when they say the
Translation of Aristotle was never begun I know the contrary
for some progress was made in both but most in the latter From
the freedom subsisting between us we took the liberty of saying
any thing to each other I one day reproached him with idleness
when to convince me my censure was unjust he showed me many
sheets of his Translation of Aristotle which he said he had so
fully employed himself about as to prevent him calling on many of
his friends so frequently as he used to do Soon after this he
engaged with Mr Manby a bookseller on Ludgate Hill to furnish
him with some Lives for the Biographia Britannica which Manby was
then publishing He showed me some of the lives in embryo but I
do not recollect that any of them came to perfection To raise a
present subsistence he set about writing his odes and having a
general invitation to my house he frequently passed whole days
there which he employed in writing them and as frequently
burning what he had written after reading them to me many of
them which pleased me I struggled to preserve but without
effect for pretending he would alter them he got them from me
and thrust them into the fire He was an acceptable companion
every where and among the gentlemen who loved him for a genius
I may reckon the Doctors Armstrong Barrowby and Hill Messrs
Quin Garrick and Foote who frequently took his opinion on their
pieces before they were seen by the public He was particularly
noticed by the geniuses who frequented the Bedford and Slaughters
Coffee Houses From his knowledge of Garrick he had the liberty of
the scenes and greenroom where he made diverting observations on
the vanity and false consequence of that class of people and his
manner of relating them to his particular friends was extremely
entertaining In this manner he lived with and upon his friends
until the death of Colonel Martyn who left what fortune he died
possessed of unto him and his two sisters I fear I cannot be
certain as to dates but believe he left the university in the
year 43 Some circumstances I recollect make me almost certain he
was in London that year but I will not be so certain of the time
he died which I did not hear of till long after it happened When
his health and faculties began to decline he went to France and
after to Bath in hope his health might be restored but without
success I never saw him after his sister removed him from
MDonalds madhouse at Chelsea to Chichester where he soon sunk
into a deplorable state of idiotism which when I was told
shocked me exceedingly and even now the remembrance of a man
for whom I had a particular friendship and in whose company I
have passed so many pleasant happy hours gives me a severe shock
Since it is in consequence of your own request Sir that I write
this long farrago I expect you will overlook all inaccuracies I
am Sir
Your very humble servant
JOHN RAGSDALE
Mr William Hymers Queens College Oxford
The following communication by Thomas Warton was also found among the
papers of Mr Hymers A few passages concerning various readings are
omitted
I often saw Collins in London in 1750 This was before his
illness He then told me of his intended History of the Revival of
Learning and proposed a scheme of a review to be called the
Clarendon Review and to be printed at the university press under
the conduct and authority of the university About Easter the
next year I was in London when being given over and supposed
to be dying he desired to see me that he might take his last
leave of me but he grew better and in the summer he sent me a
letter on some private business which I have now by me dated
Chichester June 9 1751 written in a fine hand and without the
least symptom of a disordered or debilitated understanding In
1754 he came to Oxford for change of air and amusement where he
stayed a month I saw him frequently but he was so weak and low
that he could not bear conversation Once he walked from his
lodgings opposite Christ Church to Trinity College but
supported by his servant The same year in September I and my
brother visited him at Chichester where he lived in the
cathedral cloisters with his sister The first day he was in high
spirits at intervals but exerted himself so much that he could
not see us the second Here he showed us an Ode to Mr John Home
on his leaving England for Scotland in the octave stanza very
long and beginning
Home thou returnst from Thames
I remember there was a beautiful description of the spectre of a
man drowned in the night or in the language of the old Scotch
superstitions seized by the angry spirit of the waters appearing
to his wife with pale blue cheek c Mr Home has no copy of it
He also showed us another ode of two or three fourlined stanzas
called the Bell of Arragon on a tradition that anciently just
before the king of Spain died the great bell of the cathedral of
Sarragossa in Arragon tolled spontaneously It began thus
The bell of Arragon they say
Spontaneous speaks the fatal day
Soon afterwards were these lines
Whatever dark aerial power
Commissiond haunts the gloomy tower
The last stanza consisted of a moral transition to his own death
and knell which he called some simpler bell I have seen all
his odes already published in his own handwriting they had the
marks of repeated correction he was perpetually changing his
epithets Dr Warton my brother has a few fragments of some
other odes but too loose and imperfect for publication yet
containing traces of high imagery
In illustration of what Dr Johnson has related that during his
last malady he was a great reader of the Bible I am favoured with
the following anecdote from the Reverend Mr Shenton Vicar of St
Andrews at Chichester by whom Collins was buried Walking in my
