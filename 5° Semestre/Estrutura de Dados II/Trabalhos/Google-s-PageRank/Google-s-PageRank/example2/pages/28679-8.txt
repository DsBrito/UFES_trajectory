In another story in the book called Good Manners their own Reward I
find this sentence which contains an idea for a childrens manual that
certainly ought to be written under the same title too Master Goodly
not long after this had the pleasure of seeing a small book printed and
circulated among his juvenile acquaintance called The Way to be
Invited a Second Time
We pass next to a little work of pretty fancy The Months which by
its ingenuity I hope makes up for want of drama I have included it on
that ground and also because if the descriptions were read aloud in
irregular order to small children it might be an agreeable means of
encouraging thought and observation if the listeners were asked to put a
name to each month The Months comes from a book published in 1814
entitled Tales from the Mountains the mountains being those dividing
England from Wales A story in the same volume which I nearly included
has the promising style The Spotted Cow and the Pianoforte but its
matter is not equal to its title It is indeed a variation upon a very
old theme being the narrative of two girls of equal age who coming
into a little prosperity at once gratify old desires one the
exemplary one wishing a useful cow and the other the frivolous one a
piano The author in the old remorseless way contrasts their
subsequent careers nothing but happiness and worth falling to the
sensible girl who chose the cow and nothing but disaster dogging the
steps of the foolish desirer of the musical instrument I do not think
this to be good working morality since proficiency on the piano can
also be a step towards a livelihood and independence and even Madame
Schumann one supposes had to make a start somehow The name of the
author is not known
Probably no story in this collection had more popularity in its day than
Jemima Placid of which I use only a portion And I think it deserved
it for it is very pleasantly and sympathetically written and a better
understanding of home prevails than in so many of these old books
Jemimas brothers seem to me very well drawn and certain minor touches
lend an agreeable air of reality to the book The authors name is I
believe not known His preface which I quote here is very sensible
Considering the date say about 1785 it is curiously sensible and
discerning
It has been often said that infancy is the happiest state of
human life as being exempted from those serious cares and that
anxiety which must ever in some degree be an attendant on a
more advanced age but the author of the following little
performance is of a different opinion and has ever considered
the troubles of children as a severe exercise to their patience
when it is recollected that the vexations which they meet with
are suited to the weakness of their understanding and though
trifling perhaps in themselves acquire importance from their
connection with the puerile inclinations and bounded views of
an infant mind where present gratification is the whole they
can comprehend and therefore suffer in proportion when their
wishes are obstructed
The main design of this publication is to prove from example
that the pain of disappointment will be much increased by
illtemper and that to yield to the force of necessity will be
found wiser than vainly to oppose it The contrast between the
principal character with the peevishness of her cousins temper
is intended as an incitement to that placid disposition which
will form the happiness of social life in every stage and
which therefore should not be thought beneath anyones
attention or undeserving of their cultivation
Jemima Placid is one of the many stories in which the names are
symbolical We have another example in Dicky Random and I suppose
in Captain Murderer too while in Prince Life to which we soon
come which is frankly an allegory the habit is carried beyond Bunyan
who made his attributes very like men and called them Mr or Lord to
increase the illusion or diminish the cheat The drawback to this kind
of nomenclature is that it weakens the realism of the story It also
perplexes one a little when one thinks of later generations Jemimas
two brothers for example would marry one day and their children would
necessarily be called Placid too But would they be placid And was Mr
Piners father a piner It is even more perplexing when the name carries
a calling as well as in Farmer Wheatear and Giles Joltem the carter
and Mr Coverup the sexton in the old story of Dame Partlets Farm
Suppose Mr Joltems son had become a chauffeur with rubber tyres Or
could he If not these names must have immensely have simplified the
question What to do with our boys
It is hardly necessary to say that the books which Jemima took back with
her from London on page 46 and which gave such pleasure were all
published by the same firm that issued her own history This was a
system of advertisement brought to perfection by Newbery of St Pauls
Churchyard It is so very artless and amusing that one is sorry it has
died out
For the Two Trials I have gone to a little work entitled Juvenile
Trials for telling Fibs robbing Orchards and Other Offences 1816
from which via Evenings at Home I borrowed a story for Old
Fashioned Tales The book is anonymous Surely such schoolboys and
schoolgirls never were on sea or shore but that does not matter In the
old books one did not look for reality
I have included Prince Life for two reasons Partly because it seems
to me not bad of its kind although far from being as good as Uncle
Davids Nonsensical Story in the OldFashioned Tales and partly
because I thought it interesting to show what kind of stories historical
novelists write for their own familiesfor Prince Life was written in
1855 for his little boy by G P R James the author of The Smuggler
Richelieu Darnley and scores of other romances Allegories I
must confess are not much to my taste but I have so frequently found
that what I like others dislike and what I dislike others like that I
include Prince Life here quite confidently It has given Mr Bedford
material for a good picture anyway
The Farmyard Journal which follows is not dramatic but it has
plenty of incident and is included here to foster the gift of
observation I found it in a favourite and very excellent and wise old
book Evenings at Home by the strongminded Aikinsa kind of work
which it grieves one to think is outgrown not only by the readers of
childrens books but by their writers too
The Fruits of Disobedience which comes next follows ordinary lines
and is chiefly remarkable for its busy clergy I included it because the
topic of kidnapping is one of which I think every collection of old
stories for children should take notice In every book of this nature at
least one childs face must be stained with walnut juice The story is
from the anonymous Tales of the Hermitage written for the Instruction
and Amusement of the Rising Generation 1778
The Roses Breakfast also anonymous is one of the many imitations of
Roscoes Butterflys Ball about which the English reading public so
strangely lost its head in 1808 I never considered this a good story
but now that I see it in its new type on the fair page of the present
volume I am amazed to think I ever marked it for inclusion at all It
seems to me povertystricken in fancy and very paltry in tone the idea
of making beautiful flowers as meanspirited as trumpery men and women
can be being wholly undesirable It is too late to take it out
especially as Mr Bedford has drawn a very charming picture for it but
I hope it will remain only as an objectlesson Possibly its badness may
incite someone to write a better and that would be my justification
One interesting thing about it is the light it throws on the change of
fashion in garden flowers
The Three Cakes is from an English translation of the great Monsieur
Berquins LAmi des Enfantsthe most famous childrens book in
France Armand Berquin who in addition to his own stories translated
Sandford and Merton into French was born in 1750 and died in 1791
His LAmi des Enfants 1784 was in twelve small volumes and it
covered most of the ground that a moralist for the young could cover in
those days It is more like Priscilla Wakefields Juvenile Anecdotes
to which we are coming on a larger scale than anything I can name but
no imitation for M Berquin came first The idea of The Three Cakes
was borrowed from M Berquin by the Taylors for their Original Poems
and Mary Howitt borrowed it too also for rhyming purposes French
writers when they have tried seriously to interest children have been
very successful I know of few better stories than that which in its
English translation is called Little Robinson of Paris but it is a
long book in itself and could not be condensed for our purposes While
on the subject of French stories I may refer to The Bunch of Cherries
on page 242 of this volume which is also French and comes from a work
called in the English translation Tales to My Daughter I include it
for its quaint naivete and also for its lesson of gratitude and
minute thoughtfulness But it was a sad oversight not too explicable in
a French romance not to make Augustus marry the Green Hat
I included Amendment from The Little Prisoners or Passion and
Patience 1828 because its idea is an attractive one There is always
something engaging not by any means only to the youthful mind in the
idea of a complete change in the conditions and surroundings of ones
life That is why so many of us want to be gipsies The book is
anonymous
Scourhills Adventure is from an amusing book called The Academy
which for all I know is the first real boys schoolbook ever written
Its companion is The Rector and together they describe with no
little spirit and reasonableness a school a hundred years ago with all
the escapades and errors of the boys and all the homilies of the
schoolmaster I like the episode of Scourhill as well as any because of
the pleasant interior which it containsScourhills home with the
noisy old gentlemen a little like a scene in Marryat The books are not
worth reprinting in the way that Lady Anne to which we draw near is
worth reprinting but they are worth looking at if they ever chance to
fall ones way
We come next to The Journal from Juvenile Anecdotes founded on Facts
Collected for the Amusement of Children 1803 by Priscilla Wakefield
A hundred years ago Mrs Wakefields books for the nursery which if
its literature is a guide was in those days less of a nursery than a
conventicle were in every shop She poured them forthlittle rushing
streams of didacticism The present work from which for its
quaintness I have chosen The Journal is a kind of Ann and Jane
Taylor in very obvious prose Little girls having spent their
halfcrowns on themselves at once meet members of the destitute class
and having nothing to give them are plunged into remorse little boys
creeping into the larder to steal jam eat soft soap by mistake and
never are greedy again and so forth All the conventional images and
morals are employed The whole book is one long and emphatic division of
sheep from goats The Journal is not perhaps exciting but it reflects
the quieter family life of a century ago and incidentally portrays the
thorough governess of that day
Priscilla Wakefield was a Quaker the greatgranddaughter on her
mothers side of Barclay of Ury who wrote the Apology She had a
famous niece Elizabeth Fry and a famous grandson Edward Gibbon
Wakefield the colonist She was born in 1751 and died in 1832 wrote
as I have said many instructive books for the young and was one of the
original promoters of savings banks for the people
Ellen and George or The Game at Cricket is from an old friend
Tales for Ellen by Alicia Catherine Mant from which I took for Old
Fashioned Tales the very pretty history of The Little Blue Bag I
do not consider Ellen and George as good as the Little Blue Bag and
I should not be surprised if I discovered on a severe analysis of motive
that it was included here more for its cricket than its human interest
But it has a certain sweetness and naturalness too Ellens very
sensible question as it really was on page 184 Then why dont you
send the cat away is one of the first examples of independentalmost
revolutionarythought in a child recorded by a writer for children in
the early days To say such a thing to a mother eighty years ago was
indeed a feat For the most part children then were to accept all that
was said to them by their elders as fact and neither meditate nor utter
criticism The principal difference between the children of those days
and the children of these is their present liberty of criticism Today
every child has his own opinion a hundred years ago none had
Some of the remarks on page 186 will divert the young readers of today
when girls know as much about cricket and sometimes play as well as
boys do I must confess to much perplexity as to what part could be
played in the manufacture of wickets by Georges hammer and nails Runs
were called notches at that time because the scorer cut notches on a
stick Wilsons good nature has I fear found its way more than once
into the firstclass gameat least I remember that a full toss on the
leg side went to Mr W G Grace when he had made ninetysix towards his
hundredth hundred and quite right too When it comes however to
throwing down ones bat and flinging the ball at a batsman as George
did there is no excuse to be offered I have omitted the end of the
story in which Mr Danvers condescends to take a hand at the game in a
match against George and Tom Fletcher who made it up and beats them
by a narrow margin of notches According to the author he had been in
his youth a fine bat but this statement has been cruelly discredited by
the artist who illustrated the book and who placed the gentleman in an
attitude or stance as they say now and gave him a grip on the
handle from which nothing but ridicule and disaster could result Mr
Bedford is not like this Mr Bedford is one of those rare artists who
read a story first
Of Waste Not Want Not it is unnecessary to speak It is one of the
best of the stories in Miss Edgeworths Parents Assistant most
entertaining of books with dull names I have my doubts as to whether
Benjamin was not too much encouraged above Hal but that has nothing to
do with the story
We come now to comedy and to farce The Fugitive I found in an odd
little book by a Miss Pearson called A Few Weeks at Clairmont Castle
1828 while The Butchers Tournament is from Peter Parley I read this
story when I was quite a child and it always remained in my memory and
for several years of late I have kept up a desultory search for it I
could not therefore having chanced upon it in Peter Parleys Annual
for 1843 omit it from this volume The authors name is not given but
I suppose that William Martin wrote itunder the influence of Douglas
Jerrold I should say
For Mallevilles Night of Adventure I have gone again to Jacob Abbott
from whom last year I took Embellishment The story is a chapter or
two of Beechnut best of the Franconia books Later the author changed
the name Malleville which certainly is not beautiful to Madeline but
I have left it here as in the original edition There seems to be no
middle way with Jacob Abbott you must either think him the flattest of
writers for children or the most interesting So many of my earliest
recollections are bound up with Phonny and Beechnut that I shall always
think of Jacob Abbott with enthusiasm But the heretics in this matter I
can understand although pitying them too
For looking through the scores and scoresI might I believe say
hundredsof books from which to select the twenty stories within these
covers I should consider myself amply rewarded by the discovery of
Lady Anne This storyI might almost say this novelwhich is at
once the longest and to my mind the best thing in the present volume
is anonymous All that I know of the author is that sheI take it to be
a womans workwrote also The Blue Silk Handbag but of that book I
have been able to catch no glimpse In order to bring Lady Anne into
this collection I have had here and there to condense a few pages but I
have touched nothing essential the sweet little narrative is only
shortened never altered Lady Anne was first published in 1823
With Captain Murderer which ends the book we come to another story
by a novelist this time a man of genius Charles Dickens The agreeably
gruesome trifle occurs in the essay in The Uncommercial Traveller on
Nurses Stories and it was told to the little Dickens by a dreadful
girl named Sarah who chilled him also with the dark history of Chips
the ships carpenter and the rat of the Devil The story of Chips is
better than the story of Captain Murderer but I do not care for the
responsibility of laying it before you The Captain may be held to be
forbidding enough but he is all the same well within the nurserys
traditions of acceptable villainy being only a variant upon Bluebeard
and the giant who fed upon bread made with the boneflour of Englishmen
whereas the story of Chips introduces infernal elements and makes rats
too horrible to be thought about So I feel but if anyone complains of
the grimness of the Captain I shall have I fear only a very poor
defence

Forgotten Tales of Long Ago
Dicky Random
or
Goodnature is nothing without Good Conduct
In festive play this maxim prize
Be always merryalways WISE
Do you know what hour it is when you see a clock said Mr Random to
his little son Richard
Yes father said Richard for I can count it all round When both
hands are at the top of the clock then I know it is time to leave
school
Then go and see what time it is said his father
Away ran Richard and brought back word in a moment that it was exactly
six oclock
In a few minutes after came in a friend with a young lady the former of
whom asked Mr Random why he was not ready to go with them to the
concert that evening as he had promised Mr Random replied that it
was but six oclock which however he was soon convinced was a mistake
of Richards who on being asked what he saw when he looked on the
clock replied I saw the two hands together close to the six and that
made me say it was six for I always call it twelve when they are right
opposite
Remember my dear said his father that the long hand never tells
the hour except on the stroke of twelve You ought to know that the
minute hand overtakes its fellow somewhat later every hour till at noon
and midnight they again start exactly even and when a bigger boy I
shall expect you to tell me how much difference is increased every time
they come into conjunction You now see Dicky that through such a
mistake I must make my friends wait pray therefore mind better
another time
In a few minutes after his father bid him go into the diningroom and
bring down a bottle of wine which stood in the hither corner of the
cellaret that he might help the gentleman and lady to a glass
Yes father said little Dick and up he went On the stairs he met
puss and stopped to play with her during which he forgot what had been
told him Having gotten a bottle downstairs he came and pouring out a
couple of glasses he returned with it But when on the landingplace
he naughtily drew out the cork to have a taste himself It was not only
very vulgar to drink out of the neck of a bottle but wrong to make free
slily with that which he was merely entrusted to serve out However it
rushed so fast into his mouth and was so hot that he was afraid of
being strangled It happened that he had bitten his cheek that morning
and the liquor bathing the sore place made it smart so that he put down
the bottle on the floor when in stamping about it rolled downstairs
and made a fine clatter His father ran out on hearing the noise but
was stopped in the way by seeing the young lady almost gasping for
breath and it was some minutes before she could say that he had given
her brandy instead of wine
Mr Random next proceeded upstairs where little Dick was picking up the
pieces of broken glass in doing which he cut a deep gash in his hand
Where did you take the bottle from
Out of the farther side of the cellaret said Dicky
I told you to take it from the hither side replied Mr Random
But however you shall smart for your neglect what remains of the
brandy will serve to bathe your hand and I hope the pain will make you
reflect that the loss is the same to me whether you spilt it from
design or inattention
He one day made his mother look very simple at table for which he
deserved to have suffered much more than her good nature required Young
Random was to have a grand rout in the evening with some of his little
favourites A few nice tarts custards etc had been made in the
morning for the occasion and had been most temptingly baked in the
forenoon
It happened that two gentlemen called on Mr Random about two oclock
and he insisted upon their staying to dinner in consequence of which
his lady had the pastry removed from the sideboard to the chinacloset
All children must frequently have heard their mothers say when they
wish to have anything saved for another occasion My friends you see
your dinner before you I hope you will consider yourselves at home and
not spare This is always thought to be a sufficient excuse for not
bringing anything of another sort to table
When the meat was nearly done with Mrs Random made the above remark
to her visitors who declared that nothing more was requisite She then
bid the servant put the cheese on the table
What mother said Richard is there nothing else
No my love said his mother I am sure you want nothing more
Why yes mother Where are the tarts and custards you put into the
closet
Surely you dream said his mother
No I dont indeed replied Dicky You put them away directly the
gentlemen said they would stay to dine and observed what a deal of
trouble visitors do give
Anyone will easily believe that this made Mrs Random look very
confused She hardly knew what to reply but she turned it off in the
best manner she could and said
It is you Richard who trouble me more than the visits of my friends
I am happy to see them always but on some days more than others
Today you know we have been preparing for your company and
therefore the reserve I have kept would not have been made but on your
account The pastry was intended for your visitors and not your
fathers However if you are such a child that you cannot wait till
night they shall be brought to table now but remember I will not
order any more to be made and you shall provide for your playmates out
of the money put by to purchase the magiclantern and the books
Richard looked quite down when he heard this sentence and more so when
he saw the pastry placed on the table
Dear me how soon had the tarts and custards disappeared if one of each
had been served round to the company But the gentlemen were too polite
even to taste them and father and mother declined eating any
Richards sister said she could very well wait till supper hence they
were all saved But Dicky was afterwards very severely taken to task for
speaking out of time when he was not spoken to
When evening came and the little visitors were assembled Richard who
had seen some of the sports at a country fair would show his dexterity
to amuse his young party He took up the poker and supposing it to be
a pole performed some imitations But unable long to preserve it
upright from its weight the sooty end fell on Master Snappers book
who was reading a little work upon Affability The blow fairly knocked
it out of his hand and made a great smear on his frilled shirt at
which a loud laugh ensued Now Master Snapper could not bear to be
laughed at and was so much out of humour all the evening that he would
not play
Little Dick never once all this time thought that if it had fallen on
his playfellows toe it might have lamed him and he would at least
have had to carry him a pickaback home nor did he think who was to
have paid the doctor but pleased with the mirth he had made he went
upstairs and fetched down one of the pistols which his father kept in a
private drawer Then pulling in his rockinghorse he fancied he was
one of the Light Horse and mounted it to show the sword exercise and
how he could shoot a Frenchman or a Turk at full gallop He had no
business with a rockinghorse or a pistol among young ladies but he
never thought if it were proper or not and much less if the pistol were
loaded
While he was going on a full canter he gave the words Present fire
and off it went knocked him backwards and shivered a beautiful mirror
into a thousand pieces Oh what a sad scene of confusion ensued Some
of the young ladies screamed out with fright Miss Timid knocked down
by Dicky in falling backwards lay on the ground bleeding at the nose
Some were employed in picking up the pieces of glass or pinning their
handkerchiefs over the fracture to prevent its being seen while they
stayed but such a hope was vain
The noise brought Mr and Mrs Random and all the servants upstairs who
too soon found out the havoc that had been made and demanded how it
happened All the children would willingly have screened Dicky because
they knew he had not done it to frighten but to amuse them Master
Snapper however now thinking it was his turn in a very illnatured
speech made the worst of the story But the spiteful way in which he
spoke did little Dick no harm as he seemed more rejoiced at his
misfortune than sorry for Mr Randoms loss hence it had the effect not
to increase the latters anger
Playing with balancing poles and pistols said Mr Random in a stern
accent to his son is very well in a proper place but quite
inadmissible in a room full of company Now sir what business had you
to take this pistol out of my room
Indeed father said Dicky crying I did not know it was loaded
It is but last week continued his father that you were told never
to take such a thing without asking and not even then till someone had
tried if it were loaded So many accidents have happened with firearms
which have been supposed not to be loaded that he who unguardedly
shoots another ought to take a similar chance for his own life for you
know the Scripture says An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth
Think Richard that if I had been standing before the mirror what
would have been the consequence You would have shot your father Your
mother would have died of grief and you and Letitia have been
orphans
Illustration Off it went knocked him backwards and shivered a
beautiful mirrorPage 5
Ah then I should have died too said Dicky wiping the tears from his
eyes with the back of his hand But how came you to load the pistol
last night father
Because replied his father I thought I heard something fall in the
parlour and the passagedoor being directly after shut to in a still
manner I loaded the pistols thinking that thieves had broken into the
house and pushed up the sash to shoot the first that came out
Then it was lucky said Richard I did not come out again or you
might have killed me for I got up in the night to let Juno out of the
shed where I had tied her up and she was making a sad howling Indeed
before I was aware she ran into the parlour and as it was quite dark
I tumbled over her
And broke the geraniumtree added his father
