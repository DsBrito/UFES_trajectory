pretending business and went to the Dukes house the first play I have
been at these six months according to my last vowe and here saw the
so much criedup play of Henry the Eighth which though I went with
resolution to like it is so simple a thing made up of a great many
patches that besides the shows and processions in it there is nothing
in the world good or well done Thence mightily dissatisfied back at
night to my uncle Wights and supped with them but against my stomach
out of the offence the sight of my aunts hands gives me and ending
supper with a mighty laugh the greatest I have had these many months
at my uncles being out in his grace after meat we rose and broke up
and my wife and I home and to bed being sleepy since last night
2nd Up and to the office and there sitting all the morning and at
noon to the Change in my going met with Luellin and told him how I had
received a letter and bill for L50 from Mr Deering and delivered it
to him which he told me he would receive for me To which I consented
though professed not to desire it if he do not consider himself
sufficiently able by the service I have done and that it is rather my
desire to have nothing till he be further sensible of my service From
the Change I brought him home and dined with us and after dinner I
took my wife out for I do find that I am not able to conquer myself as
to going to plays till I come to some new vowe concerning it and that I
am now come that is to say that I will not see above one in a month
at any of the publique theatres till the sum of 50s be spent and then
none before New Years Day next unless that I do become worth L1000
sooner than then and then am free to come to some other terms and so
leaving him in Lombard Street I took her to the Kings house and there
met Mr Nicholson my old colleague and saw The Usurper which is
no good play though better than what I saw yesterday However we rose
unsatisfied and took coach and home and I to the office late writing
letters and so to supper and to bed
3rd Lords day Lay long in bed and then rose and with a fire in my
chamber staid within all day looking over and settling my accounts in
good order by examining all my books and the kitchen books and I find
that though the proper profit of my last year was but L305 yet I did by
other gain make it up L444 which in every part of it was unforeseen
of me and therefore it was a strange oversight for lack of examining my
expenses that I should spend L690 this year but for the time to come
I have so distinctly settled all my accounts in writing and the
particulars of all my several layings out that I do hope I shall
hereafter make a better judgment of my spendings than ever I dined with
my wife in her chamber she in bed and then down again and till 11 at
night and broke up and to bed with great content but could not make
an end of writing over my vows as I purposed but I am agreed in every
thing how to order myself for the year to come which I trust in God
will be much for my good So up to prayers and to bed This evening Sir
W Pen came to invite me against next Wednesday being Twelfth day to
his usual feast his wedding day
4th Up betimes and my wife being ready and her mayd Besse and the
girl I carried them by coach and set them all down in Covent Garden and
there left them and I to my Lord Sandwichs lodgings but he not being
up I to the Dukes chamber and there by and by to his closett where
since his lady was ill a little red bed of velvet is brought for him to
lie alone which is a very pretty one After doing business here I
to my Lords again and there spoke with him and he seems now almost
friends again as he used to be Here meeting Mr Pierce the chyrurgeon
he told me among other Court newes how the Queene is very well again
and the King lay with her on Saturday night last and that she speaks
now very pretty English and makes her sense out now and then with
pretty phrazes as among others this is mightily cried up that meaning
to say that she did not like such a horse so well as the rest he being
too prancing and full of tricks she said he did make too much
vanity Thence to the Tennis Court after I had spent a little time in
Westminster Hall thinking to have met with Mrs Lane but I could not
and am glad of it and there saw the King play at Tennis and others but
to see how the Kings play was extolled without any cause at all was
a loathsome sight though sometimes indeed he did play very well and
deserved to be commended but such open flattery is beastly Afterwards
to St Jamess Parke being unwilling to go to spend money at the
ordinary and there spent an hour or two it being a pleasant day
seeing people play at Pell Mell where it pleased me mightily to hear
a gallant lately come from France swear at one of his companions for
suffering his man a spruce blade to be so saucy as to strike a ball
while his master was playing on the Mall
When Egerton was Bishop of Durham he often played at bowls with
his guests on the public days  On an occasion of this sort a
visitor happening to cross the lawn one of the chaplains exclaimed
You must not shake the green for the bishop is going to bowlB
Thence took coach at White Hall and took up my wife who is mighty sad
to think of her father who is going into Germany against the Turkes
but what will become of her brother I know not He is so idle and out
of all capacity I think to earn his bread Home and at my office till
is at night making my solemn vowes for the next year which I trust in
the Lord I shall keep but I fear I have a little too severely bound
myself in some things and in too many for I fear I may forget some But
however I know the worst and shall by the blessing of God observe to
perform or pay my forfeits punctually So home and to bed with my mind
at rest
5th Up and to our office where we sat all the morning where my head
being willing to take in all business whatever I am afraid I shall over
clogg myself with it But however it is my desire to do my duty and
shall the willinger bear it At noon home and to the Change where I
met with Luellin who went off with me and parted to meet again at the
Coffeehouse but missed So home and found him there and Mr Barrow
came to speak with me so they both dined with me alone my wife
not being ready and after dinner I up in my chamber with Barrow to
discourse about matters of the yard with him and his design of leaving
the place which I am sorry for and will prevent if I can He being
gone then Luellin did give me the L50 from Mr Deering which he do give
me for my pains in his business and what I may hereafter take for him
though there is not the least word or deed I have yet been guilty of in
his behalf but what I am sure has been to the Kings advantage and the
profit of the service nor ever will And for this money I never did
condition with him or expected a farthing at the time when I did do him
the service nor have given any receipt for it it being brought me by
Luellin nor do purpose to give him any thanks for it but will wherein
I can faithfully endeavour to see him have the privilege of his Patent
as the Kings merchant I did give Luellin two pieces in gold for a pair
of gloves for his kindness herein Then he being gone I to my
office where busy till late at night that through my room being over
confounded in business I could stay there no longer but went home and
after a little supper to bed
6th Twelfth day Up and to my office where very busy all the morning
being indeed over loaded with it through my own desire of doing all I
can At noon to the Change but did little and so home to dinner with
my poor wife and after dinner read a lecture to her in Geography which
she takes very prettily and with great pleasure to her and me to teach
her and so to the office again where as busy as ever in my life
one thing after another and answering peoples business particularly
drawing up things about Mr Woods masts which I expect to have a
quarrel about with Sir W Batten before it be ended but I care not At
night home to my wife to supper discourse prayers and to bed This
morning I began a practice which I find by the ease I do it with that I
shall continue it saving me money and time that is to trimme myself
with a razer which pleases me mightily
7th Up putting on my best clothes and to the office where all the
morning we sat busy among other things upon Mr Woods performance of
his contract for masts wherein I was mightily concerned but I think
was found all along in the right and shall have my desire in it to the
Kings advantage At noon all of us to dinner to Sir W Pens where a
very handsome dinner Sir J Lawson among others and his lady and his
daughter a very pretty lady and of good deportment with looking upon
whom I was greatly pleased the rest of the company of the women were
all of our own house of no satisfaction or pleasure at all My wife was
not there being not well enough nor had any great mind But to see
how Sir W Pen imitates me in everything even in his having his chimney
piece in his dining room the same with that in my wifes closett and in
every thing else I perceive wherein he can But to see again how he was
out in one compliment he lets alone drinking any of the ladies healths
that were there my Lady Batten and Lawson till he had begun with my
Lady Carteret who was absent and that was well enough and then Mr
Coventrys mistresse at which he was ashamed and would not have had
him have drunk it at least before the ladies present but his policy
as he thought was such that he would do it After dinner by coach with
Sir G Carteret and Sir J Minnes by appointment to Auditor Beales in
Salisbury Court and there we did with great content look over some old
ledgers to see in what manner they were kept and indeed it was in an
extraordinary good method and such as at least out of design to keep
them employed I do persuade Sir J Minnes to go upon which will at
least do as much good it may be to keep them for want of something to do
from envying those that do something Thence calling to see whether Mrs
Turner was returned which she is and I spoke one word only to her and
away again by coach home and to my office where late and then home to
supper and bed
8th Up and all the morning at my office and with Sir J Minnes
directing him and Mr Turner about keeping of their books according to
yesterdays work wherein I shall make them work enough At noon to the
Change and there long and from thence by appointment took Luellin
Mount and W Symons and Mr Pierce the chirurgeon home to dinner
with me and were merry But Lord to hear how W Symons do commend and
look sadly and then talk bawdily and merrily though his wife was dead
but the other day would make a dogg laugh After dinner I did go in
further part of kindness to Luellin for his kindness about Deerings L50
which he procured me the other day of him We spent all the afternoon
together and then they to cards with my wife who this day put on her
Indian blue gowne which is very pretty where I left them for an hour
and to my office and then to them again and by and by they went
away at night and so I again to my office to perfect a letter to Mr
Coventry about Department Treasurers wherein I please myself and hope
to give him content and do the King service therein So having done I
home and to teach my wife a new lesson in the globes and to supper
and to bed We had great pleasure this afternoon among other things to
talk of our old passages together in Cromwells time and how W Symons
did make me laugh and wonder today when he told me how he had
made shift to keep in in good esteem and employment through eight
governments in one year the dear 1659 which were indeed and he did
name them all and then failed unhappy in the ninth viz that of the
Kings coming in He made good to me the story which Luellin did tell
me the other day of his wife upon her deathbed how she dreamt of her
uncle Scobell and did foretell from some discourse she had with him
that she should die four days thence and not sooner and did all along
say so and did so Upon the Change a great talke there was of one Mr
Tryan an old man a merchant in LymeStreete robbed last night his
man and mayde being gone out after he was abed and gagged and robbed
of L1050 in money and about L4000 in jewells which he had in his house
as security for money It is believed by many circumstances that his man
is guilty of confederacy by their ready going to his secret till in his
desk wherein the key of his cashchest lay
9th Up my underlip being mightily swelled I know not how but by
overrubbing it it itching and to the office where we sat all the
morning and at noon I home to dinner and by discourse with my wife
thought upon inviting my Lord Sandwich to a dinner shortly It will
cost me at least ten or twelve pounds but however some arguments of
prudence I have which however I shall think again upon before I proceed
to that expence After dinner by coach I carried my wife and Jane to
Westminster leaving her at Mr Hunts and I to Westminster Hall and
there visited Mrs Lane and by appointment went out and met her at
the Trumpet Mrs Hares but the room being damp we went to the Bell
tavern and there I had her company but could not do as I used to do
yet nothing but what was honest So I to talk about her having
Hawley she told me flatly no she could not love him I took occasion
to enquire of Howletts daughter with whom I have a mind to meet a
little to see what mettle the young wench is made of being very pretty
but she tells me she is already betrothed to Mrs Michells son and
she in discourse tells me more that Mrs Michell herself had a daughter
before marriage which is now near thirty years old a thing I could not
have believed Thence leading her to the Hall I took coach and called
my wife and her mayd and so to the New Exchange where we bought
several things of our pretty Mrs Dorothy Stacy a pretty woman and
has the modestest look that ever I saw in my life and manner of speech
Thence called at Toms and saw him pretty well again but has not been
currant So homeward and called at Ludgate at Ashwells uncles but
she was not within to have spoke to her to have come to dress my
wife at the time my Lord dines here So straight home calling for
Walsinghams Manuals at my booksellers to read but not to buy
recommended for a pretty book by Sir W Warren whose warrant however
I do not much take till I do read it So home to supper and to bed
my wife not being very well since she came home being troubled with a
fainting fit which she never yet had before since she was my wife
10th Lords day Lay in bed with my wife till 10 or 11 oclock having
been very sleepy all night So up and my brother Tom being come to
see me we to dinner he telling me how Mrs Turner found herself
discontented with her late bad journey and not well taken by them in
the country they not desiring her coming down nor the burials of Mr
Edward Pepyss corps there After dinner I to the office where all the
afternoon and at night my wife and I to my uncle Wights and there eat
some of their swan pie which was good and I invited them to my house
to eat a roasted swan on Tuesday next which after I was come home did
make a quarrels between my wife and I because she had appointed a wish
tomorrow But however we were friends again quickly So to bed
All our discourse tonight was Mr Tryans late being robbed and that
Collonell Turner a mad swearing confident fellow well known by all
and by me one much indebted to this man for his very livelihood was
the man that either did or plotted it and the money and things are
found in his hand and he and his wife now in Newgate for it of which
we are all glad so very a known rogue he was
11th Waked this morning by 4 oclock by my wife to call the mayds to
their wash and what through my sleeping so long last night and vexation
for the lazy sluts lying so long again and their great wash neither my
wife nor I could sleep one winke after that time till day and then I
rose and by coach taking Captain Grove with me and three bottles of
Tent which I sent to Mrs Lane by my promise on Saturday night last to
White Hall and there with the rest of our company to the Duke and did
our business and thence to the Tennis Court till noon and there saw
several great matches played and so by invitation to St Jamess

Carteret Sir Edward Turner Sir Ellis Layton and one Mr Seymour a
fine gentleman were admirable good discourse of all sorts pleasant and
serious Thence after dinner to White Hall where the Duke being busy at
the Guinny business the Duke of Albemarle Sir W Rider Povy Sir J
Lawson and I to the Duke of Albemarles lodgings and there did some
business and so to the Court again and I to the Duke of Yorks
lodgings where the Guinny company are choosing their assistants for
the next year by ballotting Thence by coach with Sir J Robinson
Lieutenant of the Tower he set me down at Cornhill but Lord the
simple discourse that all the way we had he magnifying his great
undertakings and cares that have been upon him for these last two years
and how he commanded the city to the content of all parties when
the loggerhead knows nothing almost that is sense Thence to the
Coffeehouse whither comes Sir W Petty and Captain Grant and we fell
in talke besides a young gentleman I suppose a merchant his name Mr
Hill that has travelled and I perceive is a master in most sorts of
musique and other things of musique the universal character art
of memory Grangers counterfeiting of hands and other most excellent
discourses to my great content having not been in so good company a
great while and had I time I should covet the acquaintance of that
Mr Hill This morning I stood by the King arguing with a pretty Quaker
woman that delivered to him a desire of hers in writing The King
showed her Sir J Minnes as a man the fittest for her quaking religion
saying that his beard was the stiffest thing about him and again
merrily said looking upon the length of her paper that if all she
desired was of that length she might lose her desires she modestly
saying nothing till he begun seriously to discourse with her arguing
the truth of his spirit against hers she replying still with these
words O King and thoud him all along The general talke of the
towne still is of Collonell Turner about the robbery who it is
thought will be hanged I heard the Duke of York tell tonight how
letters are come that fifteen are condemned for the late plot by the
judges at York and among others Captain Oates against whom it was
proved that he drew his sword at his going out and flinging away the
scabbard said that he would either return victor or be hanged So home
where I found the house full of the washing and my wife mighty angry
about Wills being here today talking with her mayds which she
overheard idling of their time and he telling what a good mayd my old
Jane was and that she would never have her like again At which I was
angry and after directing her to beat at least the little girl I went
to the office and there reproved Will who told me that he went thither
by my wifes order she having commanded him to come thither on Monday
morning Now God forgive me how apt I am to be jealous of her as to
this fellow and that she must needs take this time when she knows
I must be gone out to the Duke though methinks had she that mind she
would never think it discretion to tell me this story of him to let
me know that he was there much less to make me offended with him to
forbid him coming again But this cursed humour I cannot cool in myself
by all the reason I have which God forgive me for and convince me of
the folly of it and the disquiet it brings me So home where God
be thanked when I came to speak to my wife my trouble of mind soon
vanished and to bed The house foul with the washing and quite out of
order against tomorrows dinner
12th Up and to the office where we sat all the morning and at noon
to the Change awhile and so home getting things against dinner ready
and anon comes my uncle Wight and my aunt with their cozens Mary and
Robert and by chance my uncle Thomas Pepys We had a good dinner the
chief dish a swan roasted and that excellent meate At dinner and all
day very merry After dinner to cards where till evening then to the
office a little and to cards again with them and lost halfacrowne
They being gone my wife did tell me how my uncle did this day accost
her alone and spoke of his hoping she was with child and kissing
her earnestly told her he should be very glad of it and from all
circumstances methinks he do seem to have some intention of good to us
which I shall endeavour to continue more than ever I did yet So to my
office till late and then home to bed after being at prayers which is
the first time after my late vowe to say prayers in my family twice in
every week
13th Up and to my office a little and then abroad to many several
places about business among others to the geometrical instrument
makers and through Bedlam calling by the way at an old booksellers
and there fell into looking over Spanish books and pitched upon some
till I thought of my oathe when I was going to agree for them and so
with much ado got myself out of the shop glad at my heart and so away
to the African House to look upon their book of contracts for several
commodities for my information in the prices we give in the Navy So to
the Coffee house where extraordinary good discourse of Dr Whistlers
upon my question concerning the keeping of masts he arguing against
keeping them dry by showing the nature of corruption in bodies and the
several ways thereof So to the Change and thence with Sir W Rider to
the Trinity House to dinner and then home and to my office till night
and then with Mr Bland to Sir T Viners about pieces of eight for Sir
J Lawson and so back to my office and there late upon business and
so home to supper and to bed
14th Up and to the office where all the morning and at noon all
of us viz Sir G Carteret and Sir W Batten at one end and Mr
Coventry Sir J Minnes and I in the middle at the other end being
taught how to sit there all three by my sitting so much the backwarder
at the other end to Sir G Carterets and there dined well Here I saw
Mr Scott the bastard that married his youngest daughter Much pleasant
talk at table and then up and to the office where we sat long upon our
design of dividing the Controllers work into some of the rest of our
hands for the better doing of it but he would not yield to it though
the simple man knows in his heart that he do not do one part of it So
he taking upon him to do it all we rose I vexed at the heart to see the
Kings service run after this manner but it cannot be helped Thence to
the Old James to the reference about Mr Blands business Sir W
Rider being now added to us and I believe we shall soon come to some
determination in it So home and to my office did business and then up
to Sir W Pen and did express my trouble about this days business he
not being there and plainly told him what I thought of it and though I
know him a false fellow yet I adventured as I have done often to tell
him clearly my opinion of Sir W Batten and his design in this business
which is very bad Hence home and after a lecture to my wife in her
globes to prayers and to bed
15th Up and to my office where all the morning and among other things
Mr Turner with me and I did tell him my mind about the Controller his
master and all the office and my mind touching himself too as he did
carry himself either well or ill to me and my clerks which I doubt not
but it will operate well Thence to the Change and there met my uncle
Wight who was very kind to me and would have had me home with him and
so kind that I begin to wonder and think something of it of good to me
Thence home to dinner and after dinner with Mr Hater by water and
walked thither and back again from Deptford where I did do something
checking the iron business but my chief business was my discourse with
Mr Hater about what had passed last night and today about the office
business and my resolution to do him all the good I can therein So
home and my wife tells me that my uncle Wight hath been with her and
played at cards with her and is mighty inquisitive to know whether
she is with child or no which makes me wonder what his meaning is
and after all my thoughts I cannot think unless it be in order to the
making his will that he might know how to do by me and I would to God
my wife had told him that she was
16th Up and having paid some money in the morning to my uncle Thomas
on his yearly annuity to the office where we sat all the morning
At noon I to the Change about some pieces of eight for Sir J Lawson
There I hear that Collonell Turner is found guilty of felony at the
Sessions in Mr Tryans business which will save his life So home and
met there J Hasper come to see his kinswoman our Jane I made much of
him and made him dine with us he talking after the old simple manner
that he used to do He being gone I by water to Westminster Hall and
there did see Mrs Lane So by coach home and to my office where
Browne of the Minerys brought me an Instrument made of a Spyral line
very pretty for all questions in Arithmetique almost but it must be
some use that must make me perfect in it So home to supper and to bed
with my mind un peu troubled pour ce que fait today but I hope it
will be la dernier de toute ma vie
17th Lords day Up and I and my wife to church where Pembleton
appeared which God forgive me did vex me but I made nothing of it
So home to dinner and betimes my wife and I to the French church and

together We sat by three sisters all pretty women It was pleasant to
hear the reader give notice to them that the children to be catechized
next Sunday were them of Hounsditch and Blanche Chapiton Thence home
and there found Ashwell come to see my wife we having called at her
lodging the other day to speak with her about dressing my wife when

disconcerned for any difference between us on her going away as ever
She being gone my wife and I to see Sir W Pen and there supped with
him much against my stomach for the dishes were so deadly foule that I
could not endure to look upon them So after supper home to prayers and
to bed
18th Up being troubled to find my wife so ready to have me go out of
doors God forgive me for my jealousy but I cannot forbear though God
knows I have no reason to do so or to expect her being so true to me
as I would have her I abroad to White Hall where the Court all in
mourning for the Duchesse of Savoy We did our business with the Duke
and so I to W Howe at my Lords lodgings not seeing my Lord he being
abroad and there I advised with W Howe about my having my Lord to
dinner at my house who likes it well though it troubles me that I
should come to need the advice of such a boy but for the present it is
necessary Here I found Mr Mallard and had from him a common tune set
by my desire to the Lyra Vyall which goes most admirably Thence home
by coach to the Change after having been at the Coffeehouse where I
hear Turner is found guilty of felony and burglary and strange stories
of his confidence at the barr but yet great indiscretion in his
argueing All desirous of his being hanged So home and found that Will
had been with my wife But Lord why should I think any evil of that
and yet I cannot forbear it But upon enquiry though I found no reason
of doubtfulness yet I could not bring my nature to any quiet or content
in my wife all day and night nor though I went with her to divert
myself at my uncle Wights and there we played at cards till 12 at
night and went home in a great shower of rain it having not rained
a great while before Here was one Mr Benson a Dutchman played and
supped with us that pretends to sing well and I expected great matters
but found nothing to be pleased with at all So home and to bed yet
troubled in my mind
19th Up without any kindness to my wife and so to the office where
we sat all the morning and at noon I to the Change and thence to Mr
Cutlers with Sir W Rider to dinner and after dinner with him to the
Old James upon our reference of Mr Blands and having sat there upon
the business half an hour broke up and I home and there found Madame
Turner and her sister Dike come to see us and staid chatting till
night and so away and I to my office till very late and my eyes began
to fail me and be in pain which I never felt to nowadays which I
impute to sitting up late writing and reading by candlelight So home
to supper and to bed
20th Up and by coach to my Lord Sandwichs and after long staying till
his coming down he not sending for me up but it may be he did not know
I was there he came down and I walked with him to the Tennis Court
and there left him seeing the King play At his lodgings this morning
there came to him Mr W Montagues fine lady which occasioned my
Lords calling me to her about some business for a friend of hers
preferred to be a midshipman at sea My Lord recommended the whole
matter to me She is a fine confident lady I think but not so pretty
as I once thought her My Lord did also seal a lease for the house he
is now taking in Lincolns Inn Fields which stands him in 250 per annum
rent Thence by water to my brothers whom I find not well in bed
sicke they think of a consumption and I fear he is not well but
do not complain nor desire to take anything From him I visited Mr
Honiwood who is lame and to thank him for his visit to me the other
day but we were both abroad So to Mr Commanders in Warwicke Lane to
speak to him about drawing up my will which he will meet me about in a
day or two So to the Change and walked home thence with Sir Richard
Ford who told me that Turner is to be hanged tomorrow and with what
impudence he hath carried out his trial but that last night when
he brought him newes of his death he began to be sober and shed some
tears and he hopes will die a penitent he having already confessed all
the thing but says it was partly done for a joke and partly to get an
occasion of obliging the old man by his care in getting him his things
again he having some hopes of being the better by him in his estate
at his death Home to dinner and after dinner my wife and I by water
which we have not done together many a day that is not since last
summer but the weather is now very warm and left her at Axe Yard and
I to White Hall and meeting Mr Pierce walked with him an hour in the
Matted Gallery among other things he tells me that my Lady Castlemaine
is not at all set by by the King but that he do doat upon Mrs Stewart
only and that to the leaving of all business in the world and to the
open slighting of the Queene that he values not who sees him or stands
by him while he dallies with her openly and then privately in her
chamber below where the very sentrys observe his going in and out and
that so commonly that the Duke or any of the nobles when they would
ask where the King is they will ordinarily say Is the King above or
below meaning with Mrs Stewart that the King do not openly disown
my Lady Castlemaine but that she comes to Court but that my Lord
FitzHarding and the Hambletons
The three brothers George Hamilton James Hamilton and the Count
Antoine Hamilton author of the Memoires de Grammont
and sometimes my Lord Sandwich they say have their snaps at her But
he says my Lord Sandwich will lead her from her lodgings in the darkest
and obscurest manner and leave her at the entrance into the Queenes
lodgings that he might be the least observed that the Duke of Monmouth
the King do still doat on beyond measure insomuch that the King only
the Duke of York and Prince Rupert and the Duke of Monmouth do now
wear deep mourning that is long cloaks for the Duchesse of Savoy so
that he mourns as a Prince of the Blood while the Duke of York do no
more and all the nobles of the land not so much which gives great
offence and he says the Duke of York do consider But that the Duke
of York do give himself up to business and is like to prove a noble
Prince and so indeed I do from my heart think he will He says that
it is believed as well as hoped that care is taken to lay up a hidden
treasure of money by the King against a bad day pray God it be so but
I should be more glad that the King himself would look after business
which it seems he do not in the least By and by came by Mr Coventry
and so we broke off and he and I took a turn or two and so parted and
then my Lord Sandwich came upon me to speak with whom my business of
coming again tonight to this ende of the town chiefly was in order to
the seeing in what manner he received me in order to my inviting him to
dinner to my house but as well in the morning as now though I did
wait upon him home and there offered occasion of talk with him yet he
treated me though with respect yet as a stranger without any of the
intimacy or friendship which he used to do and which I fear he will
never through his consciousness of his faults ever do again Which I
must confess do trouble me above anything in the world almost though I
neither do need at present nor fear to need to be so troubled nay and
