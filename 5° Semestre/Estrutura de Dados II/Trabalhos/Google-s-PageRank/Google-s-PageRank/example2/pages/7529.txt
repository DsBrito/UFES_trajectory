Well I was in hopes I could show you something Mr Flack said
I guess theyve seen most everything Mr Dosson observed
Well weve seen more than you exclaimed his daughter
Well Ive seen a good dealjust sitting there
A person with delicate ear might have suspected Mr Dosson of a tendency
to setting but he would pronounce the same word in a different manner
at different times
Well in Paris you can see everything said the young man Im quite
enthusiastic about Paris
Havent you been here before Miss Delia asked
Oh yes but its ever fresh And how is Miss Francie
Shes all right She has gone upstairs to get something I guess were
going out again
Its very attractive for the young Mr Dosson pleaded to the visitor
Well then Im one of the young Do you mind if I go with you Mr
Flack continued to the girl
Itll seem like old times on the deck she replied Were going to
the Bon Marche
Why dont you go to the Louvre Thats the place for YOU
Weve just come from there weve had quite a morning
Well its a good place the visitor a trifle dryly opined
Its good for some things but it doesnt come up to my idea for
others
Oh theyve seen everything said Mr Dosson Then he added I guess
Ill go and call Francie
Well tell her to hurry Miss Delia returned swinging a glove in each
hand
She knows my pace Mr Flack remarked
I should think she would the way you raced the girl returned with
memories of the Umbria I hope you dont expect to rush round Paris
that way
I always rush I live in a rush Thats the way to get through
Well I AM through I guess said Mr Dosson philosophically
Well I aint his daughter declared with decision
Well you must come round often he continued to their friend as a
leavetaking
Oh Ill come round Ill have to rush but Ill do it
Ill send down Francie And Francies father crept away
And please give her some more money her sister called after him
Does she keep the money George Flack enquired
KEEP it Mr Dosson stopped as he pushed aside the portiere Oh you
innocent young man
I guess its the first time you were ever called innocent cried
Delia left alone with the visitor
Well I WASbefore I came to Paris
Well I cant see that it has hurt US We aint a speck extravagant
Wouldnt you have a right to be
I dont think any one has a right to be Miss Dosson returned
incorruptibly
The young man who had seated himself looked at her a moment
Thats the way you used to talk
Well I havent changed
And Miss Franciehas she
Well youll see said Delia Dosson beginning to draw on her gloves
Her companion watched her leaning forward with his elbows on the arms
of his chair and his hands interlocked At last he said interrogatively
Bon Marche
No I got them in a little place I know
Well theyre Paris anyway
Of course theyre Paris But you can get gloves anywhere
You must show me the little place anyhow Mr Flack continued
sociably And he observed further and with the same friendliness The
old gentleman seems all there
Oh hes the dearest of the dear
Hes a real gentlemanof the old stamp said George Flack
Well what should you think our father would be
I should think hed be delighted
Well he is when we carry out our plans
And what are theyyour plans asked the young man
Oh I never tell them
How then does he know whether you carry them out
Well I guess hed know it if we didnt said the girl
I remember how secretive you were last year You kept everything to
yourself
Well I know what I want the young lady pursued
He watched her button one of her gloves deftly using a hairpin released
from some mysterious office under her bonnet There was a moments
silence after which they looked up at each other Ive an idea you
dont want me said George Flack
Oh yes I doas a friend
Of all the mean ways of trying to get rid of a man thats the meanest
he rang out
Wheres the meanness when I suppose youre not so ridiculous as to wish
to be anything more
More to your sister do you meanor to yourself
My sister IS myselfI havent got any other said Delia Dosson
Any other sister
Dont be idiotic Are you still in the same business the girl went
on
Well I forget which one I WAS in
Why something to do with that newspaperdont you remember
Yes but it isnt that paper any moreits a different one
Do you go round for newsin the same way
Well I try to get the people what they want Its hard work said the
young man
Well I suppose if you didnt some one else would They will have it
wont they
Yes they will have it The wants of the people however appeared at
the present moment to interest Mr Flack less than his own He looked at
his watch and remarked that the old gentleman didnt seem to have much
authority
What do you mean by that the girl asked
Why with Miss Francie Shes taking her time or rather I mean shes
taking mine
Well if you expect to do anything with her you must give her plenty of
that Delia returned
All right Ill give her all I have And Miss Dossons interlocutor
leaned back in his chair with folded arms as to signify how much if
it came to that she might have to count with his patience But she sat
there easy and empty giving no sign and fearing no future He was the
first indeed to turn again to restlessness at the end of a few moments
he asked the young lady if she didnt suppose her father had told her
sister who it was
Do you think thats all thats required she made answer with cold
gaiety But she added more familiarly Probably thats the reason
Shes so shy
Oh yesshe used to look it
No thats her peculiarity that she never looks it and yet suffers
everything
Well you make it up for her then Miss Delia the young man ventured
to declare You dont suffer much
No for Francie Im all there I guess I could act for her
He had a pause You act for her too much If it wasnt for you I think
I could do something
Well youve got to kill me first Delia Dosson replied
Ill come down on you somehow in the Reverberator he went on
But the threat left her calm Oh thats not what the people want
No unfortunately they dont care anything about MY affairs
Well we do were kinder than most Francie and I said the girl
But we desire to keep your affairs quite distinct from ours
Oh youryours if I could only discover what they are cried George
Flack And during the rest of the time that they waited the young
journalist tried to find out If an observer had chanced to be present
for the quarter of an hour that elapsed and had had any attention to
give to these vulgar young persons he would have wondered perhaps at
there being so much mystery on one side and so much curiosity on the
otherwondered at least at the elaboration of inscrutable projects on
the part of a girl who looked to the casual eye as if she were stolidly
passive Fidelia Dosson whose name had been shortened was twentyfive
years old and had a large white face in which the eyes were far apart
Her forehead was high but her mouth was small her hair was light and
colourless and a certain inelegant thickness of figure made her appear
shorter than she was Elegance indeed had not been her natural portion
and the Bon Marche and other establishments had to make up for that To
a casual sisters eye they would scarce have appeared to have acquitted
themselves of their office but even a woman wouldnt have guessed how
little Fidelia cared She always looked the same all the contrivances
of Paris couldnt fill out that blank and she held them for herself
in no manner of esteem It was a plain clean round pattern face marked
for recognition among so many only perhaps by a small figure the sprig
on a china plate that might have denoted deep obstinacy and yet with
its settled smoothness it was neither stupid nor hard It was as
calm as a room kept dusted and aired for candid earnest occasions
the meeting of unanimous committees and the discussion of flourishing
businesses If she had been a young manand she had a little the head
of oneit would probably have been thought of her that she was likely
to become a Doctor or a Judge
An observer would have gathered further that Mr Flacks acquaintance
with Mr Dosson and his daughters had had its origin in his crossing the
Atlantic eastward in their company more than a year before and in some
slight association immediately after disembarking but that each party
had come and gone a good deal since thencome and gone however without
meeting again It was to be inferred that in this interval Miss Dosson
had led her father and sister back to their native land and had then a
second time directed their course to Europe This was a new departure
said Mr Flack or rather a new arrival he understood that it
wasnt as he called it the same old visit She didnt repudiate
the accusation launched by her companion as if it might have been
embarrassing of having spent her time at home in Boston and even in a
suburban quarter of it she confessed that as Bostonians they had been
capable of that But now they had come abroad for longerever so much
what they had gone home for was to make arrangements for a European
stay of which the limits were not to be told So far as this particular
future opened out to her she freely acknowledged it It appeared to meet
with George Flacks approvalhe also had a big undertaking on that side
and it might require years so that it would be pleasant to have his
friends right there He knew his way round in Parisor any place like
thatmuch better than round Boston if they had been poked away in one
of those clever suburbs they would have been lost to him
Oh well youll see as much as you want of usthe way youll have to
take us Delia Dosson said which led the young man to ask which
that way was and to guess he had never known but one way to take
anythingwhich was just as it came Oh well youll see what youll
make of it the girl returned and she would give for the present no
further explanation of her somewhat chilling speech In spite if
it however she professed an interest in Mr Flacks announced
undertakingan interest springing apparently from an interest in the
personage himself The man of wonderments and measurements we have
smuggled into the scene would have gathered that Miss Dossons attention
was founded on a conception of Mr Flacks intrinsic brilliancy Would
his own impression have justified thatwould he have found such a
conception contagious I forbear to ridicule the thought for that would
saddle me with the care of showing what right our officious observer
might have had to his particular standard Let us therefore simply
note that George Flack had grounds for looming publicly large to
an uninformed young woman He was connected as she supposed with
literature and wasnt a sympathy with literature one of the many
engaging attributes of her so generally attractive little sister If
Mr Flack was a writer Francie was a reader hadnt a trail of forgotten
Tauchnitzes marked the former line of travel of the party of three The
elder girl grabbed at them on leaving hotels and railwaycarriages but
usually found that she had brought odd volumes She considered
however that as a family they had an intellectual link with the young
journalist and would have been surprised if she had heard the advantage
of his acquaintance questioned
Mr Flacks appearance was not so much a property of his own as a
prejudice or a fixed liability of those who looked at him whoever they
might be what they saw mainly in him was that they had seen him before
And oddly enough this recognition carried with it in general no
ability to rememberthat is to recallhim you couldnt conveniently
have prefigured him and it was only when you were conscious of him that
you knew you had already somehow paid for it To carry him in your mind
you must have liked him very much for no other sentiment not even
aversion would have taught you what distinguished him in his group
aversion in especial would have made you aware only of what confounded
him He was not a specific person but had beyond even Delia Dosson
in whom we have facially noted it the quality of the sample or
advertisement the air of representing a line of goods for which there
is a steady popular demand You would scarce have expected him to be
individually designated a number like that of the days newspaper
would have served all his or at least all your purpose and you would
have vaguely supposed the number highsomewhere up in the millions As
every copy of the newspaper answers to its name Miss Dossons visitor
would have been quite adequately marked as young commercial American
Let me add that among the accidents of his appearance was that of its
sometimes striking other young commercial Americans as fine He was
twentyseven years old and had a small square head a light grey
overcoat and in his right forefinger a curious natural crook which might
have availed under pressure to identify him But for the convenience
of society he ought always to have worn something conspicuousa green
hat or a yellow necktie His undertaking was to obtain material in
Europe for an American societypaper
If it be objected to all this that when Francie Dosson at last came in
she addressed him as if she easily placed him the answer is that she
had been notified by her fatherand more punctually than was indicated
by the manner of her response Well the way you DO turn up she said
smiling and holding out her left hand to him in the other hand or the
hollow of her slim right arm she had a lumpish parcel Though she had
made him wait she was clearly very glad to see him there and she as
evidently required and enjoyed a great deal of that sort of indulgence
Her sisters attitude would have told you so even if her own appearance
had not There was that in her manner to the young mana perceptible
but indefinable shadewhich seemed to legitimate the oddity of his
having asked in particular for her asked as if he wished to see her to
the exclusion of her father and sister the note of a special pleasure
which might have implied a special relation And yet a spectator looking
from Mr George Flack to Miss Francie Dosson would have been much at a
loss to guess what special relation could exist between them The girl
was exceedingly extraordinarily pretty all exempt from traceable
likeness to her sister and there was a brightness in hera still
and scattered radiancewhich was quite distinct from what is called
animation Rather tall than short fine slender erect with an airy
lightness of hand and foot she yet gave no impression of quick
movement of abundant chatter of excitable nerves and irrepressible
lifeno hint of arriving at her typical American grace in the most
usual way She was pretty without emphasis and as might almost have been
said without point and your fancy that a little stiffness would have
improved her was at once qualified by the question of what her softness
would have made of it There was nothing in her however to confirm
the implication that she had rushed about the deck of a Cunarder with a
newspaperman She was as straight as a wand and as true as a gem her
neck was long and her grey eyes had colour and from the ripple of her
dark brown hair to the curve of her unaffirmative chin every line in
her face was happy and pure She had a weak pipe of a voice and
inconceivabilities of ignorance
Delia got up and they came out of the little readingroomthis young
lady remarking to her sister that she hoped she had brought down all
the things Well I had a fiendish hunt for themweve got so many
Francie replied with a strange want of articulation There were a few
dozens of the pockethandkerchiefs I couldnt find but I guess Ive got
most of them and most of the gloves
Well what are you carting them about for George Flack enquired
taking the parcel from her You had better let me handle them Do you
buy pockethandkerchiefs by the hundred
Well it only makes fifty apiece Francie yieldingly smiled They
aint really nicewere going to change them
Oh I wont be mixed up with thatyou cant work that game on these
Frenchmen the young man stated
Oh with Francie theyll take anything back Delia Dosson declared
They just love her all over
Well theyre like me then said Mr Flack with friendly cheer ILL
take her back if shell come
Well I dont think Im ready quite yet the girl replied But I hope
very much we shall cross with you again
Talk about crossingits on these boulevards we want a
lifepreserver Delia loudly commented They had passed out of the
hotel and the wide vista of the Rue de la Paix stretched up and down
There were many vehicles
Wont this thing do Ill tie it to either of you George Flack said
holding out his bundle I suppose they wont kill you if they love
you he went on to the object of his preference
Well youve got to know me first she answered laughing and looking
for a chance while they waited to pass over
I didnt know you when I was struck He applied his disengaged hand to
her elbow and propelled her across the street She took no notice of
his observation and Delia asked her on the other side whether their
father had given her that money She replied that he had given her
loadsshe felt as if he had made his will which led George Flack to
say that he wished the old gentleman was HIS father
Why you dont mean to say you want to be our brother Francie prattled
as they went down the Rue de la Paix
I should like to be Miss Delias if you can make that out he
laughed
Well then suppose you prove it by calling me a cab Miss
Delia returned I presume you and Francie dont take this for a
promenadedeck
Dont she feel rich George Flack demanded of Francie But we do
require a cart for our goods and he hailed a little yellow carriage
which presently drew up beside the pavement The three got into it and
still emitting innocent pleasantries proceeded on their way while at
the Hotel de lUnivers et de Cheltenham Mr Dosson wandered down into
the court again and took his place in his customary chair
II
The court was roofed with glass the April air was mild the cry of
women selling violets came in from the street and mingling with the
rich hum of Paris seemed to bring with it faintly the odour of the
flowers There were other odours in the place warm succulent and
Parisian which ranged from fried fish to burnt sugar and there were
many things besides little tables for the postprandial coffee piles
of luggage inscribed after the initials or frequently the name R
P Scudamore or D Jackson Hodge Philadelphia Pa or St Louis
Mo rattles of unregarded bells flittings of traybearing waiters
conversations with the secondfloor windows of admonitory landladies
arrivals of young women with coffinlike bandboxes covered with black
oilcloth and depending from a strap sallyingsforth of persons staying
and arrivals just afterwards of other persons to see them together with
vague prostrations on benches of tired heads of American families
It was to this last element that Mr Dosson himself in some degree
contributed but it must be added that he had not the extremely bereft
and exhausted appearance of certain of his fellows There was an air of
ruminant resignation of habitual accommodation in him but you would
have guessed that he was enjoying a holiday rather than aching for a
truce and he was not so enfeebled but that he was able to get up from
time to time and stroll through the porte cochere to have a look at the
street
He gazed up and down for five minutes with his hands in his pockets and
then came back that appeared to content him he asked for little and
had no restlessness that these small excursions wouldnt assuage He
looked at the heapedup luggage at the tinkling bells at the young
women from the lingere at the repudiated visitors at everything but
the other American parents Something in his breast told him that he
knew all about these Its not upon each other that the animals in the
same cage in a zoological collection most turn their eyes There was
a silent sociability in him and a superficial fineness of grain that
helped to account for his daughter Francies various delicacies He was
fair and spare and had no figure you would have seen in a moment
that the question of how he should hold himself had never in his life
occurred to him He never held himself at all providence held him
ratherand very looselyby an invisible string at the end of which he
seemed gently to dangle and waver His face was so smooth that his thin
light whiskers which grew only far back scarcely seemed native to his
cheeks they might have been attached there for some harmless purpose of
comedy or disguise He looked for the most part as if he were thinking
over without exactly understanding it something rather droll that had
just occurred if his eyes wandered his attention rested just as
it hurried quite as little His feet were remarkably small and his
clothes in which light colours predominated were visibly the work of
a French tailor he was an American who still held the tradition that it
is in Paris a man dresses himself best His hat would have looked odd in
Bond Street or the Fifth Avenue and his necktie was loose and flowing
Mr Dosson it may further be noted was a person of the simplest
composition a character as cipherable as a sum of two figures He had
a native financial faculty of the finest order a gift as direct as
a beautiful tenor voice which had enabled him without the aid of
particular strength of will or keenness of ambition to build up a large
fortune while he was still of middle age He had a genius for happy
speculation the quick unerring instinct of a good thing and as he
sat there idle amused contented on the edge of the Parisian street
he might very well have passed for some rare performer who had sung his
song or played his trick and had nothing to do till the next call
And he had grown rich not because he was ravenous or hard but simply
because he had an ear not to term it a nose He could make out the tune
in the discord of the marketplace he could smell success far up
the wind The second factor in his little addition was that he was an
unassuming father He had no tastes no acquirements no curiosities
and his daughters represented all society for him He thought much
more and much oftener of these young ladies than of his bankshares and
railwaystock they crowned much more his sense of accumulated property
He never compared them with other girls he only compared his present
self with what he would have been without them His view of them was
perfectly simple Delia had a greater direct knowledge of life and
Francie a wider acquaintance with literature and art Mr Dosson had
not perhaps a full perception of his younger daughters beauty he
would scarcely have pretended to judge of that more than he would of a
valuable picture or vase but he believed she was cultivated up to the
eyes He had a recollection of tremendous schoolbills and in later
days during their travels of the way she was always leaving books
behind her Moreover wasnt her French so good that he couldnt
understand it
The two girls at any rate formed the breeze in his sail and the only
directing determinant force he knew when anything happenedand he was
under the impression that things DID happenthey were there for it to
have happened TO Without them in short as he felt he would have been
the tail without the kite The wind rose and fell of course there were
lulls and there were gales there were intervals during which he simply
floated in quiet waterscast anchor and waited This appeared to be one
of them now but he could be patient knowing that he should soon again
inhale the brine and feel the dip of his prow When his daughters were
out for any time the occasion affected him as a weatherbreederthe
wind would be then as a kind of consequence GOING to rise but their
now being out with a remarkably bright young man only sweetened the
temporary calm That belonged to their superior life and Mr Dosson
never doubted that George M Flack was remarkably bright He represented
the newspaper and the newspaper for this man of genial assumptions
representedwell all other representations whatever To know Delia and
Francie thus attended by an editor or a correspondent was really to see
them dancing in the central glow This is doubtless why Mr Dosson had
slightly more than usual his air of recovering slowly from a pleasant
surprise The vision to which I allude hung before him at a convenient
distance and melted into other bright confused aspects reminiscences
of Mr Flack in other relationson the ship on the deck at the hotel
at Liverpool and in the cars Whitney Dosson was a loyal father but
he would have thought himself simple had he not had two or three strong
convictions one of which was that the children should never go out with
a gentleman they hadnt seen before The sense of their having and his
having seen Mr Flack before was comfortable to him now it made mere
placidity of his personally foregoing the young mans society in favour
of Delia and Francie He had not hitherto been perfectly satisfied that
the streets and shops the general immensity of Paris were just the
safest place for young ladies alone But the company of a helpful
gentleman ensured safetya gentleman who would be helpful by the fact
of his knowing so much and having it all right there If a big newspaper
told you everything there was in the world every morning that was
what a big newspaperman would have to know and Mr Dosson had never
supposed there was anything left to know when such voices as Mr Flacks
and that of his organ had daily been heard In the absence of such happy
chancesand in one way or another they kept occurringhis girls might
have seemed lonely which was not the way he struck himself They were
his company but he scarcely theirs it was as if they belonged to him
more than he to them
They were out a long time but he felt no anxiety as he reflected that
Mr Flacks very profession would somehow make everything turn out to
their profit The bright French afternoon waned without bringing them
back yet Mr Dosson still revolved about the court till he might have
been taken for a valet de place hoping to pick up custom The landlady
smiled at him sometimes as she passed and repassed and even ventured
to remark disinterestedly that it was a pity to waste such a lovely day
indoorsnot to take a turn and see what was going on in Paris But Mr
Dosson had no sense of waste that came to him much more when he was
confronted with historical monuments or beauties of nature or art which
affected him as the talk of people naming others naming friends of
theirs whom he had never heard of then he was aware of a degree of
waste for the others as if somebody lost somethingbut never when he
lounged in that simplifying yet so comprehensive way in the court It
wanted but a quarter of an hour to dinnerTHAT historic fact was not
beyond his measurewhen Delia and Francie at last met his view still
accompanied by Mr Flack and sauntering in at a little distance from
each other with a jaded air which was not in the least a tribute to his
possible solicitude They dropped into chairs and joked with each other
mingling sociability and languor on the subject of what they had
seen and donea question into which he felt as yet the delicacy of
enquiring But they had evidently done a good deal and had a good
time an impression sufficient to rescue Mr Dosson personally from the
consciousness of failure Wont you just step in and take dinner with
us he asked of the young man with a friendliness to which everything
appeared to minister
Well thats a handsome offer George Flack replied while Delia put it
on record that they had each eaten about thirty cakes
Well I wondered what you were doing so long But never mind your
cakes Its twenty minutes past six and the table dhotes on time
You dont mean to say you dine at the table dhote Mr Flack cried
Why dont you like thatand Francies candour of appeal to their
comrades taste was celestial
Well it isnt what you must build on when you come to Paris Too many
flowerpots and chickens legs
Well would you like one of these restaurants asked Mr Dosson I
dont careif you show us a good one
Oh Ill show you a good onedont you worry Mr Flacks tone was
ever that of keeping the poor gentleman mildly but firmly in his place
Well youve got to order the dinner then said Francie
Well youll see how I could do it He towered over her in the pride
of this feat
He has got an interest in some place Delia declared He has taken us
to ever so many stores where he gets his commission
Well Id pay you to take them round said Mr Dosson and with much
agreeable trifling of this kind it was agreed that they should sally
forth for the evening meal under Mr Flacks guidance
If he had easily convinced them on this occasion that that was a more
original proceeding than worrying those old bones as he called it at
the hotel he convinced them of other things besides in the course of
the following month and by the aid of profuse attentions What he mainly
made clear to them was that it was really most kind of a young man who
had so many big things on his mind to find sympathy for questions for
issues he used to call them that could occupy the telegraph and the
press so little as theirs He came every day to set them in the right
path pointing out its charms to them in a way that made them feel how
much they had been in the wrong It made them feel indeed that they
didnt know anything about anything even about such a matter as
ordering shoesan art in which they had vaguely supposed themselves
rather strong He had in fact great knowledge which was wonderfully
various and he knew as many people as they knew few He had
appointmentsvery often with celebritiesfor every hour of the day
and memoranda sometimes in shorthand on tablets with elastic straps
with which he dazzled the simple folk at the Hotel de lUnivers et de
Cheltenham whose social life of narrow range consisted mainly in
reading the lists of Americans who registered at the bankers and at
Galignanis Delia Dosson in particular had a trick of poring solemnly
over these records which exasperated Mr Flack who skimmed them and
found what he wanted in the flash of an eye she kept the others waiting
while she satisfied herself that Mr and Mrs D S Rosenheim and Miss
