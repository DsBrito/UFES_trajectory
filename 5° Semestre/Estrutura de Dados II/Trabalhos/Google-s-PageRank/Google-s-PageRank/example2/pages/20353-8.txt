BEST NONSENSE VERSES
FATHER WILLIAM
You are old father William the young man said
And your hair has become very white
And yet you incessantly stand on your head
Do you think at your age it is right
In my youth father William replied to his son
I feared it might injure the brain
But now that Im perfectly sure I have none
Why I do it again and again
You are old said the youth as I mentioned before
And have grown most uncommonly fat
Yet you turned a back somersault in at the door
Pray what is the reason of that
In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks
I kept all my limbs very supple
By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
Allow me to sell you a couple
You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
For anything tougher than suet
Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
Pray how did you manage to do it
In my youth said his father I took to the law
And argued each case with my wife
And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
Has lasted the rest of my life
You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
That your eye was as steady as ever
Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
What made you so awfully clever
I have answered three questions and that is enough
Said his father dont give yourself airs
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff
Be off or Ill kick you down stairs
Lewis Carroll
THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER
The sun was shining on the sea
Shining with all his might
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright
And this was odd because it was
The middle of the night
The moon was shining sulkily
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done
Its very rude of him she said
To come and spoil the fun
The sea was wet as wet could be
The sands were dry as dry
You could not see a cloud because
No cloud was in the sky
No birds were flying overhead
There were no birds to fly
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand
If this were only cleared away
They said it would be grand
If seven maids with seven mops
Swept it for half a year
Do you suppose the Walrus said
That they could get it clear
I doubt it said the Carpenter
And shed a bitter tear
O Oysters come and walk with us
The Walrus did beseech
A pleasant walk a pleasant talk
Along the briny beach
We cannot do with more than four
To give a hand to each
The eldest Oyster looked at him
But never a word he said
The eldest Oyster winked his eye
And shook his heavy head
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oysterbed
But four young oysters hurried up
All eager for the treat
Their coats were brushed their faces washed
Their shoes were clean and neat
And this was odd because you know
They hadnt any feet
Four other oysters followed them
And yet another four
And thick and fast they came at last
And more and more and more
All hopping through the frothy waves
And scrambling to the shore
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row
The time has come the Walrus said
To talk of many things
Of shoesand shipsand sealingwax
Of cabbagesand kings
And why the sea is boiling hot
And whether pigs have wings
But wait a bit the Oysters cried
Before we have our chat
For some of us are out of breath
And all of us are fat
No hurry said the Carpenter
They thanked him much for that
A loaf of bread the Walrus said
Is what we chiefly need
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed
Now if youre ready Oysters dear
We can begin to feed
But not on us the Oysters cried
Turning a little blue
After such kindness that would be
A dismal thing to do
The night is fine the Walrus said
Do you admire the view
It was so kind of you to come
And you are very nice
The Carpenter said nothing but
Cut us another slice
I wish you were not quite so deaf
Ive had to ask you twice
It seems a shame the Walrus said
To play them such a trick
After weve brought them out so far
And made them trot so quick
The Carpenter said nothing but
The butters spread too thick
I weep for you the Walrus said
I deeply sympathize
With sobs and tears he sorted out
Those of the largest size
Holding his pockethandkerchief
Before his streaming eyes
O Oysters said the Carpenter
Youve had a pleasant run
Shall we be trotting home again
But answer came there none
And this was scarcely odd because
Theyd eaten every one
Lewis Carroll
THE HUNTING OF THE SNARKExtracts
Come listen my men while I tell you again
The five unmistakable marks
By which you may know wheresoever you go
The warranted genuine Snarks
Let us take them in order The first is the taste
Which is meagre and hollow but crisp
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist
With a flavour of Willothewisp
Its habit of getting up late youll agree
That it carries too far when I say
That it frequently breakfasts at fiveoclock tea
And dines on the following day
The fourth is its fondness for bathingmachines
Which it constantly carries about
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes
A sentiment open to doubt
The fifth is ambition It next will be right
To describe each particular batch
Distinguishing those that have feathers and bite
From those that have whiskers and scratch
For although common Snarks do no manner of harm
Yet I feel it my duty to say
Some are Boojums The Bellman broke off in alarm
For the Baker had fainted away
They roused him with muffinsthey roused him with ice
They roused him with mustard and cress
They roused him with jam and judicious advice
They set him conundrums to guess
When at length he sat up and was able to speak
His sad story he offered to tell
And the Bellman cried Silence Not even a shriek
And excitedly tingled his bell
There was silence supreme Not a shriek not a scream
Scarcely even a howl or a groan
As the man they called Ho told his story of woe
In an antediluvian tone
My father and mother were honest though poor
Skip all that cried the Bellman in haste
If it once becomes dark theres no chance of a Snark
We have hardly a minute to waste
I skip forty years said the Baker in tears
And proceed without further remark
To the day when you took me aboard of your ship
To help you in hunting the Snark
A dear uncle of mine after whom I was named
Remarked when I bade him farewell
Oh skip your dear uncle the Bellman exclaimed
As he angrily tingled his bell
He remarked to me then said the mildest of men
If your Snark be a Snark that is right
Fetch it home by all meansyou may serve it with greens
And its handy for striking a light
You may seek it with thimblesand seek it with care
You may hunt it with forks and hope
You may threaten its life with a railwayshare
You may charm it with smiles and soap
But oh beamish nephew beware of the day
If your Snark be a Boojum For then
You will softly and suddenly vanish away
And never be met with again
It is this it is this that oppresses my soul
When I think of my uncles last words
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl
Brimming over with quivering curds
It is this it is this We have had that before
The Bellman indignantly said
And the Baker replied Let me say it once more
It is this it is this that I dread
I engage with the Snarkevery night after dark
In a dreamy delirious fight
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes
And I use it for striking a light
But if ever I met with a Boojum that day
In a moment of this I am sure
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away
And the notion I cannot endure
The Bellman looked uffish and wrinkled his brow
If only youd spoken before
Its excessively awkward to mention it now
With the Snark so to speak at the door
We should all of us grieve as you well may believe
If you never were met with again
But surely my man when the voyage began
You might have suggested it then
Its excessively awkward to mention it now
As I think Ive already remarked
And the man they called Hi replied with a sigh
I informed you the day we embarked
You may charge me with murderor want of sense
We are all of us weak at times
But the slightest approach to a false pretence
Was never among my crimes
I said it in HebrewI said it in Dutch
I said it in German and Greek
But I wholly forgot and it vexes me much
That English is what you speak
Lewis Carroll
JABBERWOCKY
Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Beware the Jabberwock my son
The jaws that bite the claws that catch
Beware the Jubjub bird and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch
He took his vorpal sword in hand
Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
And stood awhile in thought
And as in uffish thought he stood
The Jabberwock with eyes of flame
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood
And burbled as it came
One two One two And through and through
The vorpal blade went snickersnack
He left it dead and with its head
He went galumphing back
And hast thou slain the Jabberwock
Come to my arms my beamish boy
Oh frabjous day Callooh Callay
He chortled in his joy
Twas brillig and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe
All mimsy were the borogoves
And the mome raths outgrabe
Lewis Carroll
THE JUMBLIES
1
They went to sea in a sieve they did
In a sieve they went to sea
In spite of all their friends could say
On a winters morn on a stormy day
In a sieve they went to sea
And when the sieve turned round and round
And every one cried Youll all be drowned
They called aloud Our sieve aint big
But we dont care a button we dont care a fig
In a sieve well go to sea
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
2
They sailed away in a sieve they did
In a sieve they sailed so fast
With only a beautiful peagreen veil
Tied with a ribbon by way of a sail
To a small tobaccopipe mast
And everyone said who saw them go
Oh wont they be soon upset you know
For the sky is dark and the voyage long
And happen what may its extremely wrong
In a sieve to sail so fast
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
3
The water it soon came in it did
The water it soon came in
So to keep them dry they wrapped their feet
In a pinky paper all folded neat
And they fastened it down with a pin
And they passed the night in a crockery jar
And each of them said How wise we are
Though the sky be dark and the voyage be long
Yet we never can think we are rash or wrong
While round in our sieve we spin
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
4
And all night long they sailed away
And when the sun went down
They whistled and warbled a moony song
To the echoing sound of the coppery gong
In the shade of the mountains brown
O Timballoo How happy we are
When we live in a sieve and a crockeryjar
And all night long in the moonlight pale
We sail away with a peagreen sail
In the shade of the mountains brown
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
5
They sailed to the Western sea they did
To a land all covered with trees
And they bought an owl and a useful cart
And a pound of rice and a cranberrytart
And a hive of silvery bees
And they bought a pig and some green jackdaws
And a lovely monkey with lollipop paws
And forty bottles of ringboree
And no end of Stilton cheese
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
6
And in twenty years they all came back
In twenty years or more
And every one said How tall theyve grown
For theyve been to the lakes and the Torrible Zone
And the hills of the Chankly Bore
And they drank their health and gave them a feast
Of dumplings made of beautiful yeast
And every one said If we only live
We too will go to sea in a sieve
To the hills of the Chankly Bore
Far and few far and few
Are the lands where the Jumblies live
Their heads are green and their hands are blue
And they went to sea in a sieve
Edward Lear
THE YONGHYBONGHYBO
1
On the Coast of Coromandel
Where the early pumpkins blow
In the middle of the woods
Lived the YonghyBonghyBo
Two old chairs and half a candle
One old jug without a handle
These were all his worldly goods
In the middle of the woods
These were all the worldly goods
Of the YonghyBonghyBo
Of the YonghyBonghyBo
2
Once among the Bongtrees walking
Where the early pumpkins blow
To a little heap of stones
Came the YonghyBonghyBo
There he heard a Lady talking
To some milkwhite Hens of Dorking
Tis the Lady Jingly Jones
On that little heap of stones
Sits the Lady Jingly Jones
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
3
Lady Jingly Lady Jingly
Sitting where the pumpkins blow
Will you come and be my wife
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
I am tired of living singly
On this coast so wild and shingly
Im aweary of my life
If youll come and be my wife
Quite serene would be my life
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
4
On this Coast of Coromandel
Shrimps and watercresses grow
Prawns are plentiful and cheap
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
You shall have my chairs and candle
And my jug without a handle
Gaze upon the rolling deep
Fish is plentiful and cheap
As the sea my love is deep
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
5
Lady Jingly answered sadly
And her tears began to flow
Your proposal comes too late
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
I would be your wife most gladly
Here she twirled her fingers madly
But in England Ive a mate
Yes youve asked me far too late
For in England Ive a mate
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
6
Mr Jones his name is Handel
Handel Jones Esquire  Co
Dorking fowls delights to send
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
Keep oh keep your chairs and candle
And your jug without a handle
I can merely be your friend
Should my Jones more Dorkings send
I will give you three my friend
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
7
Though youve such a tiny body
And your head so large doth grow
Though your hat may blow away
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
Though youre such a Hoddy Doddy
Yet I wish that I could modi
fy the words I needs must say
Will you please to go away
That is all I have to say
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
Mr YonghyBonghyBo
8
Down the slippery slopes of Myrtle
Where the early pumpkins blow
To the calm and silent sea
Fled the YonghyBonghyBo
There beyond the Bay of Gurtle
Lay a large and lively Turtle
Youre the Cove he said for me
On your back beyond the sea
Turtle you shall carry me
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
Said the YonghyBonghyBo
9
Through the silent roaring ocean
Did the Turtle swiftly go
Holding fast upon his shell
Rode the YonghyBonghyBo
With a sad primeval motion
Toward the sunset isles of Boshen
Still the Turtle bore him well
Holding fast upon his shell
Lady Jingly Jones farewell
Sang the YonghyBonghyBo
Sang the YonghyBonghyBo
10
From the Coast of Coromandel
Did that Lady never go
On that heap of stones she mourns
For the YonghyBonghyBo
On that Coast of Coromandel
In his jug without a handle
Still she weeps and daily moans
On the little heap of stones
To her Dorking Hens she moans
For the YonghyBonghyBo
For the YonghyBonghyBo
