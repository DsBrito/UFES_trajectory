THE TALE OF JOLLY ROBIN
I
NESTLINGS
Of course there was a time once when Jolly Robin was just a
nestling himself With two brothers and one sisterall of them like
him much spotted with blackhe lived in a house in one of Farmer
Greens apple trees
The house was made of grass and leaves plastered on the inside with
mud and lined with softer finer grass which his mother had chosen
with the greatest care
But Jolly never paid much attention to his first home What
interested him more than anything else was food From dawn till dark
he was always cheeping for something to eat And since the other
children were just as hungry as he was those four growing babies kept
their parents busy finding food for them It was then that Jolly Robin
learned to like angleworms And though he ate greedily of insects and
bugs as well as wild berries he liked angleworms best
Jolly and his sister and his brothers could always tell when their
father or their mother brought home some dainty because the moment
the parent lighted upon the limb where the nest was built they could
feel their home sink slightly from the added weight upon the branch
Then the youngsters would set up a loud squalling with a great
craning of necks and stretching of orangecolored mouths
Sometimes when the dainty was specially big Mr or Mrs Robin would
say Cuck cuck That meant Open wide But they seldom found it
necessary to give that order
Somehow Jolly Robin managed to eat more than the rest of the
nestlings And so he grew faster than the others He soon learned a
few tricks too For instance if Mrs Robin happened to be sitting on
the nest to keep her family warm when Mr Robin returned with a
lunch for the children Jolly had a trick that he played on his
mother in case she didnt move off the nest fast enough to suit him
He would whisper to the rest of the children And then they would
jostle their fond parent lifting her up above them and sometimes
almost upsetting her so that she had hard work to keep from falling
off the nest
Mrs Robin did not like that trick very well But she knew that Jolly
would not annoy her with it long Indeed he was only eleven days old
when he left his birthplace and went out into the wide world
You see the young folk grew so fast that they soon more than filled
the house So there was nothing their parents could do but persuade
them to leave home and learn to fly
One day therefore Mr Robin did not bring his childrens food to the
edge of the nest and drop it into their mouths Instead he stood on
the limb a little distance away from them and showed them a plump
angleworm
The sight of that dainty was more than Jolly Robin could resist He
scrambled boldly out of the nest and tottering up to his father on
his wobbling legs he snatched the tempting morsel out of his proud
parents bill
Jolly never went back to the nest after that The next day Mrs Robin
coaxed the other children from home in the same fashion And though it
may seem a heartless act it was really the best thing that could have
happened to Jolly and his sister and his brothers
You see they had to learn to fly And so long as they stayed in the
nest they could never learn a difficult feat like flying
II
LEARNING TO FLY
After Jolly Robin had gulped down the fat angleworm with which his
father had coaxed him to leave the nest he clung desperately to the
limb With no food in sight he had plenty of time to look about him
and to be alarmed
The day was not gone before he had a great fright He tumbled out of
the apple tree and fell squawking and fluttering upon the ground
Luckily his mother happened to be at home She went to Jolly at once
and told him not to be afraid
Nothing will hurt you she said if youll only keep still But if
you squall like that the cat will find you
It may seem strange but his mothers words frightened Jolly all the
more They scared him so thoroughly that he stopped making a noise
anyhow And that was how he learned never to talk when he was on the
ground near a house where a cat might live
Now said Jollys mother as soon as he was still Ill teach you a
new game Just watch me And spreading her wings she flapped them
and sprang into the air
Soon Jolly was trying to imitate her And it was not long before he
found himself gliding a short distance skimming along just off the
ground
But in spite of all his efforts he couldnt help falling again
Though his mother tried to show him how to fly into a treetop Jolly
Robin seemed unable to learn the trick
At last Mr Robin said to his wife
Ill teach him the rest Youve made a good beginning But he must
learn more at once Theres no telling when the cat may come into the
orchard to hunt for fieldmice And you know what would happen then
His wife shuddered But Mr Robin told her not to worry
Ill soon have this youngster so he can fly as well as anybody he
declared
So he went and hopped about on the ground with Jolly for a little
while showing him how to find worms beneath the grass carpet of the
orchard
And then in a loud voice Mr Robin suddenly cried
The cat The cat And he flew into an old tree nearby
Jolly Robin had never seen Farmer Greens cat But he had heard that
she was a dreadful fierce creature And when his father shouted her
name Jolly was so startled that he forgot he didnt quite know how to
fly Before he knew what he was doing he followed his father right up
into the old apple tree and perched himself on a low branch
That was the way he learned to fly for he never had the least trouble
about it afterward And as soon as he realized that he had actually
flown from the ground to the bough he was so pleased that he began to
laugh merrily
As for the cat she was not in the orchard at all Indeed Jollys
father had not said that she was You see he had played a joke on his
son
Now up to that time Jolly Robin had not been named You must
remember that he was not two weeks old And having three other
children of the same age his parents had not been able to think of
names for all of them
But this big youngster laughed so heartily that his father named him
Jolly on the spot And Jolly he remained ever afterward
III
THE WIDE WIDE WORLD
After he learned to fly Jolly Robins father took him into the woods
to spend each night in a roost where there were many other young
robins whose fathers had likewise brought them there
Jolly learned a great deal from being with so many new friends It was
not long before he could find plenty of food for himself without help
from anyone
He discovered too that there was safety in numbers For example if
Jasper Jay made too great a nuisance of himself by bullying a young
robin a mob of robins could easily put Jasper to flight
Always help other people That was a motto that all the youngsters
had to learn And another was this Follow your fathers lead
Later in the season in October when the robin cousins and uncles and
aunts and sisters and brothers and all the rest of the relations made
their long journey to their winter homes in the South Jolly found
that there was a good reason for such rules If he hadnt followed his
father then he might have lost his way becausesince it was the
first time he had ever been out of Pleasant Valleyhe knew nothing
whatever about travelling
He looked forward with much interest to the journey for as the days
grew shorter he heard a great deal of talk about the trip among his
elders And while he was waiting for the day when they should leave he
became acquainted with many new and delicious morsels to eat He
roamed about picking wild grapes mulberries and elderberries And he
did not scorn a large green katydid when he chanced to find one
There was always some new dainty to be sampled though as the weather
grew colder Jolly began to understand that in winter Pleasant Valley
would not be so fine a place to live
However he managed to find food enough so that he continued to grow
rapidly The night after he found a mountain ash on a hillside full
of bright red berries his father said that he seemed much taller than
he had been that morning
You must have eaten a great many of those berries said Mr Robin
Well I notice one thing Jolly observed My waistcoat is fast
losing its black spots And its redder than it was The red berries
certainly colored it in some way
Mr Robin replied that he had never heard of such a thing happening
He looked curiously at his sons waistcoat
It does seem to look different he said Its brighter than it
was
Really that was only because Jolly was fast growing up But neither
he nor his father stopped to think of that And since Jolly had
learned that motto Follow your fathers lead he thought his
waistcoat ought to be just as red as old Mr Robins was
So Jolly visited the mountain ash each day and fairly stuffed himself
with the bright red fruit
It did him no harm anyhow And he enjoyed eating it
And the next spring when Jolly Robin returned to Pleasant Valley
after spending the winter in the South there was not a redder
waistcoat than his in all the neighborhood
IV
WHAT JOLLY DID BEST
Jolly Robin had something on his mind For several days he had been
turning a certain matter over in his head But in spite of all his
thinking he seemed unable to find any answer to the question that was
troubling him So at last he decided he would have to ask somebody to
help him
And that was why Jolly stopped Jimmy Rabbit near the garden one day
I want your advice he told Jimmy Rabbit
Certainly that young gentleman replied And he sat himself down
upon his wheelbarrow and looked very earnest If its anything about
gardening he said I should advise you to raise cabbages by all
means
But Jolly Robin said he wasnt thinking of planting a garden
In fact he explained the trouble is I dont know what to do Id
like to have some regular work you know And since youve had a good
deal of experience having run a toothpulling parlor a barbershop
and a shoestore I thought you might be able to tell me what would be
a good business for me to take up
For a few minutes Jimmy Rabbit did not speak But he nodded his head
wisely
Let me see he said at last Whats the thing you do best
Jolly Robin replied at once that he thought he could fly better than
he could do anything else And he felt so happy because he was sure
Jimmy Rabbit was going to help him that he began to laugh gaily And
he couldnt help singing a snatch of a new song he had heard that
morning And then he laughed again
Youre mistaken Jimmy Rabbit said to him You fly well enough I
dare say But there are others who can beat you at flying No he
declared What you can do better than anybody I know is to laugh
And if I were you I should make laughing my regular business
That idea struck Jolly Robin as being so funny that he laughed harder
than ever And Jimmy Rabbit nodded his head again as if to say Im
right and I know it
At last Jolly Robin stopped laughing long enough to ask Jimmy to
explain how anyone could make a business of laughing I dont see how
it could be done said Jolly Robin
Whyits simple enough Jimmy told him All you need do is to find
somebody who will hire you to laugh for him There are people you
know who find it very difficult to laugh I should think theyd be
glad to pay somebody to do their laughing for them
Name someone Jolly Robin urged him
And Jimmy Rabbit did
Theres old Mr Crow he said You know how solemn he is Its
positively painful to hear him try to laugh at a joke Im sure he
would be delighted with this idea And if I were you Id see him
before somebody else does
Jolly Robin looked puzzled
Who would ever think of such a thing but you he asked
Nobody Jimmy Rabbit replied But I like the scheme so well that I
almost wish I hadnt mentioned it And unless you make your bargain
with old Mr Crow at once I may decide to go into the laughing
business myself My advice to you he said is to hurry
So Jolly Robin thanked him And then he flew away to find old Mr
Crow
Of course he went to the cornfield first
V
LAUGHING FOR MR CROW
Sure enough old Mr Crow was in the cornfield And though he was
feeling somewhat peevish that morning because a coon had disturbed
his rest the night before he listened to what Jolly Robin had to
say
Ive come to ask you a question Jolly told him Ive decided to go
into businessthe laughing business And I want to inquire if you
wouldnt like to engage me to do your laughing for you
Well that struck old Mr Crow as being very funny He forgot all
about his loss of sleep And his eye twinkled quite merrily He tried
to laugh too but it was a pitiful attemptno more than a hoarse
cackle which was as Jimmy Rabbit had said positively painful Old
Mr Crow seemed to realize that he was making a very queer sound He
hastily turned his laugh into a cough and pretended that he had a
kernel of corn stuck in his throat
What are your prices he asked Jolly Robin Are you going to charge
by the day or by the laugh
Just as you prefer Jolly answered
Well Ill have to think about it old Mr Crow told him Its a
question that I wouldnt care to decide in a hurry If I paid you by
the day you might not laugh at all And if I paid you by the laugh you
might laugh all the time It would be pretty expensive either way
And I dont believe Id like that
Ill tell you what Ill do said Jolly Robin then Ill stay with
you one day for nothing And well see how the arrangement suits us
That suggestion pleased Mr Crow
Agreed he said quickly And now he added you may laugh for me
because I am quite delighted
So Jolly Robin laughed happily And old Mr Crow remarked that it was
a fair laugh though not so loud as he would have liked
Ill do better next time Jolly assured him
Good said Mr Crow And now since Ive finished my breakfast
well go over to the woods and see whats going on there this
morning
The first person they saw in the woods was Peter Mink He was fishing
for trout in Broad Brook And old Mr Crow as soon as he spied him
sang out
How many of Farmer Greens fish have you eaten this morning
Peter Mink was just crawling out of the water with a fish in his
mouth When he heard Mr Crow calling to him he dropped his trout
upon a rock and looked up quickly
How much of Farmer Greens corn have you stolen for your breakfast
he cried
At that Jolly Robin began to laugh But Mr Crow stopped him quickly
Dont laugh the old gentleman squawked Theres nothing to laugh
at so far as I can see
So Jolly managed to smother his laughter for he noticed that Mr Crow
was angry
Youll have to be careful Mr Crow warned him You mustnt laugh
at the wrong time you know
Ill do my best Jolly Robin promised And he could see already that
old Mr Crow was going to be hard to please
VI
TICKLING A NOSE
Old Mr Crow did not want to stay near the brook to talk with Peter
Mink Calling to Jolly Robin to follow him he flapped his way to the
edge of the woods and sat in a tree overlooking the pasture
Here comes Tommy Fox Mr Crow exclaimed We ought to have some fun
with him So when its time for you to laugh for me dont forget to
laugh loudly
Ill remember Jolly promised him And just by way of practice he
chirruped so merrily that Tommy Fox pricked up his ears and came
bounding up to the tree where Jolly and Mr Crow were sitting
Good morning Mr Crow cried to Tommy Is that a hens feather
thats stuck behind your ear he asked very solemnly
No said Tommy Fox Its a crows and I certainly had a fine
breakfast
Now Jolly Robin wasnt quite sure whether he ought to laugh or not
And then Tommy winked at him So Jolly thought there must be a joke
somewhere and he began to chirrup as loudly as he could
For pitys sake keep still old Mr Crow snapped
But you wanted me to laugh louder Jolly reminded him
Yes said Mr Crowwhen theres anything to laugh at
But didnt Tommy Fox make a joke Jolly Robin asked
A very poor one old Mr Crow replied A very poor joke indeed
I see he added I see youve not had much experience laughing for
people And heres where you make a mistake You laugh at other
peoples jokes which is all wrong After this you must laugh at my
jokesdo you understand
Jolly Robin said he understood And Mr Crow remarked that he was glad
there would be no more trouble
And now the old fellow said now well go over to the swamp where
Uncle Sammy Coon lives We ought to have some fun with him
So over to the swamp they flew where they found Uncle Sammy Coon
sunning himself in the top of a tall hemlock
Howdydo said Mr Crow
But Uncle Sammy Coon did not answer
Were in luck Mr Crow said with a chuckle I declare I believe
the old beggars asleep Just watch me play a practical joke on him
So Mr Crow lighted on a branch near Uncle Sammy Coon and began
tickling his nose
Pretty soon Uncle Sammy Coon sneezed And when that happened Mr Crow
jumped back quickly But Uncle Sammy didnt awakeat least he didnt
open his eyes So Mr Crow tickled his nose again
Now old Mr Crow was so amused that he glanced at Jolly Robin to see
if he was watching And in that instant when Mr Crow looked away
Uncle Sammy Coon leaped at him He caught Mr Crow by the tail too
The old gentleman set up a great din He squawked Help help at
the top of his voice and flapped his broad wings
The struggle was over in a moment By a great effort Mr Crow broke
away leaving one of his tailfeathers with Uncle Sammy Coon and flew
into another tree nearby
Then Jolly Robin laughed as if he would never stop He thought that it
must be the proper time to laugh because Mr Crow had said he was
going to play a joke on Uncle Sammy
Mr Crow however seemed to think differently about the matter
Do keep quiet he cried Theres nothing to laugh at so far as I
can see
But you said you were going to play a joke on Uncle Sammy Coon
didnt you Jolly inquired
Yes Mr Crow replied But its no joke to lose a tailfeather And
I wouldnt think of laughing at what just happened Besides he
continued your laughter is altogether wrong What you must try to
do is to laugh very sadly In fact he added I wouldnt mind if
you shed a few tears because I feel quite upset over this unfortunate
accident
Well Jolly Robin saw at once that it was impossible for him to please
Mr Crow
My laughter he said is always merry I couldnt laugh sadly no
matter how hard I might try And as for shedding tears I couldnt
weep for you even if you lost all your tailfeathers Mr Crow
Then you may leave at once Mr Crow cried just as if Farmer
Greens pasture belonged to him
Yes Jolly Robin answered I mayand then again I may not
And since he stayed right there and laughed old Mr Crow himself flew
away It was a long while too before he could bear to hear people
laugh For he thought they must be laughing at him because he had
lost a tailfeather
And perhaps that was what amused Jolly Robin though I never thought
of that before
VII
A NEW WAY TO TRAVEL
The time had come when Jolly Robin was ready to begin his long journey
to the South for it was growing quite cold On some days there was no
sun at all And even when the weather was fair the sun rose late and
went to bed early It was exactly the sort of weather Jolly Robin did
not like
No doubt youll be leaving us soon Jasper Jay remarked to Jolly one
day when the two chanced to meet in Farmer Greens woods where the
beeches grew
I expect to start tomorrow Jolly Robin answered with a short
laugh The mere thought of his warm lightflooded winter home in the
Southland made him feel glad
Well well Jasper Jay exclaimed Im glad I happened to see you
for I know of a new way to travel
And Jolly Robin wanted to know all about it
If its a better way than the old Ill be pleased to try it he
said
Oh its much better Jasper told him If I hadnt made up my mind
to spend the winter in Pleasant Valley Id go the new way myself But
the beechnut crop is good this fall So I shall stay right here to
enjoy it
Tell me how were to go if you please Jolly Robin urged him
We said Jasper You dont mean to say you are going with a
crowd do you
Why yes Jolly Robin replied All the Robins are leaving
tomorrow And I had intended to go with them
Jasper Jay shook his head
Take my advice and dont do any such thing he said Youll find it
quieter travelling alone And though you may not know it its the
fashionable thing to do
Jolly Robin laughed when Jasper said that
But Im not a fashionable person he exclaimed
Then you should become one Jasper told him Besides the new way
is easier as well as more stylish But if youre afraid to try
something new of course I wouldnt think of urging you
Im not afraid Jolly Robin cried And if youll only tell me what
Im to do I promise you Ill do it
Good said Jasper Jay Meet me here day after tomorrow and Ill
start you on your journey I cant explain anything now because I
must hurry over to the woods at once where my cousin Mr Crow is
waiting for me Then he flew away screaming a loud goodby as he
went
So Jolly Robin hastened back to the orchard to find his wife and tell
her what he had decided to do
He had no difficulty at all in finding her But he had no end of
trouble trying to persuade her to travel with him the new way instead
of going along with the crowd in the good oldfashioned style In
fact she raised so many objections saying how lonely it would be and
how dangerous it was to travel in a small party and that she didnt
want to be fashionableshe raised so many objections that at last
Jolly Robin said very well she might do as she pleased But as for
him he was going to meet Jasper Jay just as he had promised And
since the new way was easier he expected to reach their winter home
long before she arrived even if he did start a day later
But he was disappointed all the same And he kept up such a constant
laughing and joking all the rest of that day that his wife knew he
must be feeling quite out of sorts
For that was a way Jolly Robin had The worse he felt the happier he
always acted And it was not a bad way either
VIII
JOLLY IS LEFT BEHIND
All of Jolly Robins friends and relations were greatly surprised when
they saw him bidding his wife and children goodby on the day the
Robin family started from Pleasant Valley for their winter home in the
South
Whats this they cried Arent you coming with us
And Jolly Robin laughed and said to them gaily
Not today But youll find me waiting for you when you reach your
journeys end
His wife however shook her head
Its one of his queer notionshis and Jasper Jays she explained
Tut tut her husband said And he chucked her under the chinand
winked at his friends
There was no time to say anything more for everyone was eager to
start So the travellers called goodby to Jolly while he waved a
farewell to them
It was not many minutes before he was the only member of the Robin
family left in Pleasant Valley He felt very lonely all at once And
he wanted to hurry after the others But he knew what Jasper Jay would
say if he did Jasper would be sure to tell people that Jolly Robin
was afraid to travel a new way Of course Jolly didnt want that
to be said about him So he looked as cheerful as he could and he
whistled the merriest tune he knew Nobodyexcept his wife
maybewould have guessed that he wasnt perfectly happy
Jolly spent a very lonely night When he went to the roost where the
whole Robin family had been sleeping for several weeks he found it
distressingly silent after the gay chatter that he had grown
accustomed to hearing there And try as he would he could not keep
just a hint of sadness out of his goodnight song
But in the morning he felt better And he welcomed the dawn with a
carol that was joyous enough for anybody For this was the day when
Jasper Jay was going to show him the new way to travel Yes he too
would soon be hurrying southwards where the sun was warm
It was no wonder that he sang Cheerilycheerup cheerilycheerup
right merrily
As soon as he had eaten his breakfast Jolly went to the place where
the beeches grew to find Jasper Jay And Jasper was there just
finishing his own breakfast But he was too busy he said to bother
with Jolly Robin just then
You meet me in the orchard this afternoon he said when the suns
over the mountain and Ill start you on your journey
So Jolly Robin had to wait all the long day while Jasper Jay did a
hundred silly things such as mocking Farmer Greens cat and teasing
a sleepy young owl and making the woods echo with his hoarse screams
Jasper was late too in keeping his appointment in the orchard Jolly
Robin waited for him until almost sunset before Jasper Jay appeared
But Jolly was so glad to see Jasper that he never once thought of
being angry with him
Come along said the bluecoated rascal Follow me and youll soon
learn the new way to the South And if it isnt a good one I hope Ill
never eat another beechnut
Jolly Robin laughed He was sure then that he had nothing to worry
about For everybody knew that Jasper Jay was specially fond of
beechnuts
IX
JOLLYS MISTAKE
With Jolly Robin following close behind him Jasper Jay flew directly
to the crossroads almost halfway to the village Once there he
perched himself upon the signpost at the four corners And Jolly
Robin seated himself upon one of the boards that were nailed to the
post
Here we are said Jasper Jay You see how easy it is
When will the post begin to move Jolly Robin inquired a bit
