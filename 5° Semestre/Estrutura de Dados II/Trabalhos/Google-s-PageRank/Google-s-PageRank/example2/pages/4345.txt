THE DEVITTS
Everyone at Melkbridge knew the Devitts they lived in the new
pretentiouslooking house standing on the right a few minutes after
one left the town by the Bathminster road It was a blustering
stareoneintheface kind of house which defied one to question the
financial stability of its occupants The Devitts were like their home
in being new ostentatious folk their prosperity did not extend
further back than the father of Montague the present head of the
family
Montague Devitt did little beyond attending board meetings of the
varied industries which his fathers energy had called into being He
was a bluff wellsetup man who had married twice both of his wives
had brought him money Each time Montague chose a mate he had made
some effort to follow the leanings of his heart but money not lying in
the same direction as love an overmastering instinct of his blood had
prevailed against his sentimental inclinations in each case it had
insisted on his marrying in one instance an interest in iron works in
another a third share of a Portland cement business
His first wife had borne him two sons and a daughter his second was
childless
Montague was a member of two or three Bohemian clubs in London to
which as time went on he became increasingly attached At these he
passed as a good fellow chiefly from a propensity to stand drinks to
any and everyone upon any pretence he was also renowned amongst his
boon companions for his rendering of The Village Blacksmith in dumb
show a performance greeted by his thirsty audience with thunders of
applause
Harold his first born will be considered later
Lowther his second son can be dismissed in a few words He was a
goodlooking specimen of the British bounder His ideas of life were
obtained from the Winning Post and the morality or want of it
suggested by musical comedy productions at the Gaiety Theatre He
thought coarsely of women While spending money freely in the society
of ladies he met at the Empire promenade or in the Cafe d lEurope
he practised mean economics in private
Victoria Montagues daughter was a bit of a puzzle to friends and
relations alike all of whom commenced by liking her a sentiment
which sooner or later gave place to a feeling of dissatisfaction She
was a disappointment to her father although he would never admit it to
himself indeed if he had tried to explain this displeasure he would
have been hard put to it to give a straightforward cause for a
distressing effect On first acquaintance it would seem as if she were
as desirable a daughter as heart of father could want She was tall
goodlooking well educated she had abundance of tact
accomplishments and refinement she had never given her parents a
moment of anxiety What then was wrong with her from her fathers
point of view He was well into middle age increasing years made him
yearn for the love of which his life had been starved this craving
would have been appeased by love for his daughter but the truth was
that he was repelled by the girls perfection She had never been known
to lose her temper not once had she shown the least preference for any
of the eligible young men of her acquaintance although always
becomingly dressed she was never guilty of any feminine foibles which
would have endeared her to her father To him such correctness
savoured of inhumanity much of the same feeling affected the girls
other relatives and friends to the ultimate detriment of their esteem
Hilda Montagues second wife was the type of woman that successful
industrialism turns out by the gross Sincere wellmeaning narrow
homely expensively but indifferently educated her opinion on any
given subject could be predicted her childlessness accentuated her
want of mental breadth She read the novels of Mrs Humphry Ward she
was vexed if she ever missed an Academy if she wanted a change she
frequented fashionable wateringplaces She was much exercised by the
existence of the social evil she belonged to and for her
subscribed heavily to a society professing to alleviate if not to
cure this distressing ailment of the body politic She was the
honorary secretary of a vigilance committee whose operations extended
to the neighbouring towns of Trowton and Devizeton The good woman was
ignorant that the starvation wages which her husbands companies paid
were directly responsible for the existence of the local evil she
deplored and which she did her best to eradicate
Miss Spraggs Hilda Devitts elder sister lived with the family at
Melkbridge House She was a virgin with a taste for scribbling which
commonly took the form of lengthy letters written to those she thought
worthy of her correspondence She had diligently read every volume of
letters which she could lay hands on of persons whose performance was
at all renowned in this department of literature foreign ones in
translations and was by way of being an agreeable rattle albeit of a
pinchbeck provincial genus Miss Spraggs was much courted by her
relations who were genuinely proud of her local literary reputation
Also let it be said that she had the disposal of capital bringing in
five hundred a year
Montagues eldest son Harold was at once the pride and grief of the
Devitts although custom had familiarised them with the calamity
attaching to his life
He had been a comely athletic lad with a nature far removed from that
of the other Devitts he had seemed to be in the nature of a reversion
to the type of gentleman who it was said had imprudently married an
ancestress of Montagues first wife Whether or not this were so in
manner mind and appearance Harold was generations removed from his
parents and brother He had been the delight of his fathers eye until
an accident had put an end to the high hopes which his father had
formed of his future A canal ran through Melkbridge some way from the
town this narrowed its course to run beneath a footbridge locally
known as the Gallows bridge
It was an achievement to jump this stretch of water Harold Devitt was
renowned amongst the youth of the neighbourhood for the performance of
this feat He constantly repeated the effort but did it once too
often One July morning he miscalculated the distance and fell to be
picked up some while after insensible He had injured his spine After
many weeks of suspense suffered by his parents these learned that
their dearly loved boy would live although he would be a cripple for
life Little by little Harold recovered strength till he was able to
get about Melkbridge on a selfpropelled tricycle any day since the
year of the accident his kindly distinguished face might be seen in
the streets of the town or the lanes of the adjacent country where he
would pull up to chat with his many friends
His affliction had been a terrible blow to Harold when he had first
realised the permanent nature of his injuries he had cursed his fate
his impotent rage had been pitiful to behold This travail occurred in
the first year of his affliction later he discovered as so many
others have done in a like extremity that time accustoms the mind to
anything he was now resigned to his misfortune His sufferings had
endowed him with a great tolerance and a vast instinct of sympathy for
all living things qualities which are nearly always lacking in young
men of his present age which was twentynine The rest of the family
stood in some awe of Harold realising his superiority of mind they
feared to be judged at the bar of his opinion also he had some
hundreds a year left him in his own right by his mother it was
unthinkable that he should ever marry Another thing that
differentiated him from his family was that he possessed a sense of
humour
It may be as well to state that Harold plays a considerable part in
this story which is chiefly concerned with a young woman of whom the
assembled Devitts were speaking in the interval between tea and dinner
on a warm July day Before setting this down however it should be
said that the chief concern of the Devitts excepting Harold was to
escape from the social orbit of successful industrialism in which they
moved to the exalted spheres of county society
Their efforts so far had only taken them to certain halfway houses on
their road The families of consequence about Melkbridge were
oldfashioned conservative folk who resented the intrusion in their
midst of those they considered beneath them
Whenever Montague a borough magistrate met the buffers of the great
families upon the bench or in the hunting field he found them civil
enough but their young men would have little to do with Lowther while
its womenfolk ignored the assiduities of the Devitt females
The drawingroom in which the conversation took place was a large
overfurnished room in which a conspicuous object was a picture most
of which the lower part was hidden by padlocked shutters the portion
which showed was the full face of a beautiful girl
The picture was an Etty taken in part payment of a debt by
Montagues father but as it portrayed a nude woman the old Puritan
had employed a Melkbridge carpenter to conceal that portion of the
figure which the artist had omitted to drape Montague would have had
the shutters removed but had been prevailed upon by his wife to allow
them to remain until Victoria was married an event which at present
she had no justification for anticipating
The late afternoon post had brought a letter for Mrs Devitt which gave
rise to something of a discussion
Actually here is a letter from Miss Annie Mee said Mrs Devitt
Your old schoolmistress remarked Miss Spraggs
I didnt know she was alive went on Mrs Devitt She writes from
Brandenburg College Aynhoe Road West Kensington Park London asking
me to do something for her
Of course commented the agreeable rattle
How did you know asked Mrs Devitt looking up from the letter she
was reading with the help of glasses
Didnt you know that there are two kinds of letters those you want
and those that want something asked Miss Spraggs in a way that
showed she was conscious of saying a smart thing
I can hardly believe human nature to be so depraved as you would make
it out to be Eva remarked Mrs Devitt who disliked the fact of her
unmarried sister possessing sharper wits than her own
Oh I say is that your own guffawed Devitt from his place on the
hearthrug
Why shouldnt it be asked Miss Spraggs demurely
Anyway continued Mrs Devitt impatiently she wishes to know if I am
in want of a companion or anything of that sort as she has a teacher
she is unable to keep owing to her school having fallen on bad times
Then shes young cried Lowther who was lolling near the window
Her name is Mavis Keeves she is the only daughter of the late
Colonel Keeves who I believe before he was overtaken by misfortune
occupied a position of some importance in the vicinity of Melkbridge
read Mrs Devitt from Miss Annie Mees letter
Keeves Keeves echoed her husband
Do you remember him asked his wife
Of course he replied He was a MFH and knew everyone everyone
was here synonymous with the elect the Devitts were pining to meet on
equal terms His was Sir Henry Ockendons place
The prospects of Mavis Keeves securing employment with the Devitts had
suddenly increased
How was it he came down asked the agreeable rattle keenly
interested in anything having to do with the local aristocracy past or
present
The old story speculatin solicitors replied Montague who made a
point of dropping his gs One week saw him reduced from money to
nixes
Mrs Devitt raised her eyebrows
I mean nothin corrected Devitt
How very distressing remarked Victoria in her exquisitely modulated
voice We should try and do something for her
We will said her father
We certainly owe a duty to those who were once our neighbours
assented Miss Spraggs
Do you remember her asked Mrs Devitt of her husband
Of course I do now I come to think of it he replied
What was she like
He paused for a moment or two before replying
Shed reddy sort of hair and queer eyes She was a fine little girl
but a fearful tomboy said Devitt
Pretty then exclaimed Mrs Devitt as she glanced apprehensively at
her stepdaughter
She was then It was her hair that did it answered her husband
Hm came from his wife
The pretty child of today is the plain girl of tomorrow commented
Miss Spraggs
What was her real disposition asked Mrs Devitt
I know nothin about that but she was always laughin when I saw her
Frivolous commented Mrs Devitt
Perhaps theres more about her in the letter suggested Lowther who
had been listening to all that had been said
There is said his stepmother but Miss Mees writing is very
trying to the eyes
Montague took the schoolmistresss letter from his wifes hand He read
the following in his big blustering voice
In all matters affectin Miss Keevess educational qualifications I
find her comme il faut with the possible exception of freehand
drawing which is not all that a fastidious taste might desire Her
disposition is winnin and unaffected but I think it my duty to
mention that on what might appear to others as slight provocation
Miss Keeves is apt to give way to sudden fits of passion which
however are of short duration Doubtless this is a fault of youth
which years and experience will correct
Rebellious commented Mrs Devitt
Spirit said Harold who all this while had been reclining in his
invalid chair apparently reading a review
Mrs Devitt looked up as if surprised
After all everything depends on the point of view remarked Miss
Spraggs
Is there any more asked Harold
By way of reply his father read from Miss Mees letter
In conclusion I am proud to admit that Miss Keeves has derived much
benefit from so many years association with one who has endeavoured to
influence her curriculum with the writins of the late Mr Ruskin whose
acquaintance it was the writers inestimable privilege to enjoy With
my best wishes for your welfare I remain dear Madam your obedient
servant Annie Allpress Mee Thats all he added as he tossed the
letter on to the table at his wifes side
Did she know Ruskin asked Harold
When I was at her schoolit was then at Fulhamshe or her sister
never let a day go by without making some reference to him replied
his stepmother
What are you going to do for Miss Keeves asked Harold
Its so difficult to decide offhand his stepmother replied
Cant you think of anything father persisted Harold
Its scarcely in my line answered Montague glancing at his wife as
he spoke
Harold looked inquiringly at Mrs Devitt
Its so difficult to promise her anything till one has seen her she
remarked
Then why not have her down asked Harold
Yes why not echoed his brother
She can get here and back again in a day added Harold as his eyes
sought his review
Very well then Ill write and suggest Friday said Mrs Devitt not
too willingly taking up a pen
You can always wire and put her off if you want to do anything else
remarked her sister
Wont you send her her fare asked Harold
Is that necessary queried Mrs Devitt
Isnt it usual
I can give it to her when she comes said Mrs Devitt who hated
parting with money although when it was a question of entertaining
the elect of Melkbridge she spent her substance lavishly
Thus it came about that a letter was written to Miss Annie Mee
Brandenburg College Aynhoe Road West Kensington Park London W
saying that Mrs Devitt would expect Miss Keeves for an interview by
the train that left Paddington for Melkbridge at ten on Friday next
also that she would defray her thirdclass travelling expenses
CHAPTER TWO
MAVIS KEEVES
The following Friday morning Mavis Keeves sprang from bed on waking
It was late when she had gone to sleep the previous night for she had
been kept up by the festivities pertaining to breakingup day at
Brandenburg College and the inevitable talk over the incidents of
the event with Miss Helen and Miss Annie Mee which conversation had
been prolonged till nearly twelve oclock but the excitement of
travelling to the place of her birth and the certainty of getting an
engagement in some capacity or another Mavis had no doubt on this
point were more than enough to curtail her slumbers She had fallen
asleep laughing to herself at the many things which had appealed to her
sense of humour during the day and it was the recollection of some of
these which made her smile directly she was awake She tubbed and
dressed quickly although she had some bother with her hair which
this morning seemed intent on defying the efforts of her fingers
Having dressed herself to her somewhat exigent satisfaction she went
downstairs passing the doors of those venerable virgins the Misses
Helen and Annie Mee as she descended to the groundfloor on which was
the schoolroom This was really two rooms but the folding doors which
had once divided the apartment had long since been removed from their
hinges they were now rotting in the strip of garden behind the house
The appearance of Brandenburg College belied its pretentious name Once
upon a time its nameplate had decorated the gates of a stately old
mansion in the Fulham of many years ago here it was that Mrs Devitt
then Miss Hilda Spraggs had been educated Since those fat days the
nameplate of Brandenburg College had suffered many migrations always
in a materially downward direction till now it was screwed on the
railings of a stuffy little road in Shepherds Bush which as Mavis
was in the habit of declaring was called West Kensington Park for
short
The brass plate much the worse for wear told the neighbourhood that
Brandenburg College educated the daughters of gentlemen perhaps it was
as well that this definition like the plate was fallen on hard times
inasmuch as it was capable of such an elastic interpretation that it
enabled the Misses Mee to accept pupils whom in their prosperous days
they would have refused Mavis looked round the familiar shabby
schoolroom with its atmosphere of ink and slate pencil to which she
was so soon to say goodbye
It looked desolate this morning perhaps because there leapt to her
fancy the animated picture it had presented the day before when it had
been filled by a crowd of pupils dressed in their best their
admiring parents and friends
Yesterdays programme had followed that of all other girls school
breakingup celebrations with the difference that the passages
selected for recital had been wholly culled from the writings of Mr
Ruskin Reference to the same personage had occurred in the speech to
the prizewinners every girl in the school had won a prize of sorts
made by Mr Smiley the curate who performed this office also the
Misses Mee when opportunity served had not been backward in making
copious references to the occasion on which they had drunk tea with the
deceased author Indeed the parents and friends had breathed such an
atmosphere of Ruskin that there were eight requests for his works at
the local free library during the following week
Good old Ruskin laughed Mavis as she ran downstairs to the
breakfast room which was situated in the basement Here the only
preparation made for the meal was a not too clean tablecloth spread
upon the table Mavis went into the kitchen where she found Amelia
the general servant doing battle with a smoky kitchenfire
How long before breakfast is ready asked Mavis
Is that you miss Oi cant see you properly said Amelia as she
turned her head This ere smoke had got into my best oye
Amelia spoke truly there was a great difference between the seeing
capacity of her two eyes one of these being what is known as walled
Amelia was an orphan she had been dragged up by the Metropolitan
Association for Befriending Young Servants known to its familiars as
the Mabys such designation being formed by the first letter of each
word of the title Every week dozens of these young women issued from
the doors of the many branches of this institution who became to
their respective mistresses a source of endless complaint in times of
domestic stress one or two of these generals had been known to keep
their situations for three months Amelia was a prodigy of success a
record in the annals of the society inasmuch as she had been at
Brandenburg College for two years and a half She kept her situation
because she was cheap also because she did her best to give
satisfaction as she appreciated the intellectual atmosphere of the
place which made her hope that she too might pick up a few
educational crumbs moreover she was able to boast to her intimates
on the occasions when she visited her parent home how her two
mistresses could speak four languages which was certainly true
Wasnt it all beautiful miss asked Amelia who had listened to
yesterdays entertainment halfway down the stairs leading to the
basement
Wonderful replied Mavis as she tied on a kitchen apron a
preliminary to giving Amelia a helping hand with the breakfast
And the reverend He did make me laugh when he gave four prizes to
fat Miss Robson and said she was a good all round girl
This joke had not been intentional on Mr Smileys part he had been
puzzled by the roar of laughter which had greeted his remark when he
divined its purport he was quite willing to take credit for having
deliberately made the sally
You managed to hear that asked Mavis
Yes miss an what the reverend said about dear Mr Fuskin I eard
that too
Ruskin corrected Mavis as she set about making coffee
Amelia with a hurt expression on her face turned to look at Miss
Keeves who noticing the girls dejection said
Call him what you like Amelia Its only the Miss Mees whore so
particular
Dear gentleman continued Amelia Next to being always with you
miss I should like to have been with im
Im afraid you cant even be with me I have to earn my own living
Yes miss but when you marry a rich gentleman I should like to come
with you as general
Dont talk nonsense Amelia
But it aint miss didnt the music master im with the lovely
long shiny air promise me a shillin to give you a note
Did he laughed Mavis Its nearly eight youd better take in the
breakfast things
Oh well if I cant be here or with you Id sooner be with that
dear Mr
Ruskin Amelia interrupted Mavis Try and get it right if only for
once
Amelia took no notice of the interruption but went on as she dusted
the cups before putting them on the tray
Dear Mr Fuskin Ow I would have looked after im and ow carefully
Id ave counted is washing
Punctually as the clock struck eight the two Miss Mees entered the
breakfast room they kissed Mavis on the cheek before sitting down to
the meal They asked each other and Mavis how they had slept as was
their invariable custom but the sensitive observant girl could not
help noticing that the greetings of her employers were a trifle less
cordial than was their wont Mavis put down this comparative coldness
to their pride at the success of yesterdays festival
To the indifferent observer the Miss Mees were exactly alike being
meagre dilapidated whitehaired old ladies with the same beaked
noses and receding chins both wore rusty black frocks each of which
was decorated with a white cameo brooch both walked with the same
propitiatory shuffle They were like a couple of elderly moulting
decorous hens who in spite of their physical disabilities had
something of a presence This was obtained from the authority they had
wielded over the many pupils who had passed through their hands
Nearer inspection showed that Miss Annie Mee was a trifle stouter than
her sister if this be not too robust a word to apply to such a wisp of
a woman that her eyes were kinder and less watery than Helens also
that her face was less insistently marked with lines of care
The Miss Mees dispositions were much more dissimilar than their
appearance Miss Helen the elder loved her home and in her heart of
hearts preferred the kitchen to any other part of the house It was
she who attended to the ordering of the few wants of the humble
household she arranged the meals paid the bills and generally looked
after the domestic economy of the college she took much pride in the
orderliness of her housekeepers cupboard into which Amelia never
dared to pry In the schoolroom she received the parents arranged the
fees and extras and inflicted the trifling punishment she awarded to
delinquents which latter it must be admitted gave her a faint
pleasure
Annie Mee her sister had a natural inclination for the fleshpots of
life She liked to lie abed on Sunday and holiday mornings she spread
more butter on her breakfast toast than Helen thought justified by the
slenderness of their resources she was indulgent to the pupils and
seized any opportunity that offered of going out for the evening She
frequented and had been known to enjoy entertainments given in
schoolrooms for church purposes she welcomed the theatre or concert
tickets which were sometimes sent her by the father of one of the
pupils who was behind with his account when however paltry the
promised fare she would be waiting at the door clad in her faded
garments a full hour before the public were admitted in order not to
miss any of the fun Mavis usually accompanied her on these excursions
although she was soon bored by the tenthrate singers and the poor
plays she heard and saw she was compensated by witnessing the pleasure
Miss Annie Mee got from these sorry dissipations
The two sisters dispositions were alike in one thing the good works
they unostentatiously performed The sacrifices entailed by these had
much contributed to their declining fortunes This unity of purpose did
not stay them from occasionally exchanging embittered remarks when
heated by difference of opinion
When they sat down to breakfast Helen poured out the coffee
What day does the West London Observer come out asked Annie
presently of Mavis
Friday I believe
There should be some account of yesterdays proceedings said Miss
Helen The very proper references which Mr Smiley made to our
acquaintance with the late Mr Ruskin are worthy of comment
I have never known the applause to be so hearty as it was yesterday
remarked Annie after she had eaten her first piece of toast
What is the matter Mavis asked Miss Helen
A crumb stuck in my throat replied Mavis saying what was untrue as
she bent over her plate This action was necessary to hide the smile
that rose to her lips and eyes at the recollection of yesterdays
applause to which Miss Annie had referred It had amused Mavis to
notice the isolated clapping which followed the execution of an item
in the programme by a solitary performer this came from her friends in
the room The conclusion of a duet would be greeted by two patches of
appreciation whilst a pianoforte concerto which engaged sixteen
hands merged the eight oases of applause into a roar of approval
How do you get to Paddington Mavis asked Miss Helen after she had
finished her meagre breakfast
From Addison Road replied Mavis who was still eating
Wouldnt Shepherds Bush be better asked Annie who was wondering if
she could find accommodation for a further piece of toast
I always recommend parents to send their daughters from Paddington via
Addison Road remarked Helen severely
There are more trains from Shepherds Bush persisted Annie
Maybe dear Annie when relations between the sisters were strained
they made use of endearing terms but more genteel people live on the
Addison Road connection
But Helen dear the class of residence existing upon a line of
railway does not enable a traveller to reach his or her destination the
quicker
I was not aware dear Annie that I ever advanced such a proposition
Then there is no reason dearest Helen why Mavis shouldnt reach
Paddington by going to Shepherds Bush
None beyond the fact that it is decided that she shall travel by way
of Addison Road Besides Addison Road is nearer dear
But the exercise of walking to Shepherds Bush would do Mavis good
after the fatigues of yesterday Helen
That is altogether beside the point dear Annie
I am never listened to complained her sister angrily
You argue for the sake of talking replied the other crossly
They continued in that strain for some moments and were still at it
when Mavis went upstairs to put on her hat here she gave a last look
at herself in the glass
I wonder if Ill do she thought as she dealt with one or two
strands of tawny coloured hair which were still inclined to be
rebellious
I wonder if Ill meet anyone who remembers me she thought as she
left the room
Downstairs the two old ladies were awaiting her in the hall Miss
Helen was full of good advice for the journey whilst Miss Annie
dangled a packet of sandwiches In case dear Mavis should need
refreshment on the way
Thanks so much said Mavis as she took the little packet the
brownpaper covering of which was already greasestained from the fat
of the sandwiches
Dont fail to remember me to Mrs Devitt urged Helen
I wont forget said Mavis
I put salt and mustard in the sandwiches remarked Annie
Thanks so much cried Mavis as she opened the front door
And dont forget to be sure and travel in a compartment reserved for
