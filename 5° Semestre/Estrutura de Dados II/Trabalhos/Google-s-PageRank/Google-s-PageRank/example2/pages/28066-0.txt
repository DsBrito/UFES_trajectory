obliging wellbred affable kind From this it will be seen that civil
government depends upon the intelligence and righteousness of the people
The absence of all legal demands and all legal restraints would be the
absence of all government It would be libertinism or lawlessness The
great majority of men from the earliest ages of the world to the present
time have been under the control of tyrants and have known little
exemption from despotic rule There is not a single Pagan Mahomedan or
antiChristian country today in which the spirit of liberty has an
abiding place She may have brooded over them at intervals but like
Noahas bird found no resting place
The influence of the Bible preventing the young the mature and the aged
from crime causing men and women to love and respect our humanity is of
necessity to the same extent the very life of civil government and
consequently the life of civil liberty It has been said the Bible is the
great protector and guardian of the liberties of men It was an axiom in
an apostate church that ignorance is the mother of devotion but the true
origin of this axiom is that ignorance which fastens the chains of civil
and ecclesiastic despotism
It is not possible for a people thoroughly under the influence of the
teachings of the religion of Christ to be ignorant of their own rights and
the responsibility of their rulers Where the teachings of Christ and the
Bible form public opinion the people must be free No such tyrant as
Caligula or Nero would be tolerated in Protestant Christendom The
necessary effect of Christianity upon an abused people is to make them
restless under a tyrantas yoke The author of Travels in England France
Spain and the Barbary States although an enemy to the Bible said after
leaving the Barbary States and arriving in France I could breathe more
freely I no longer looked upon my fellow men with distrust and I thanked
God that I was once more in a Christian land When we survey the history
of past events and kingdoms we too find good reasons to thank the Lord
for a Christian land The only authoritative history of remote events and
kingdoms is in the writings of Moses and the Prophets In the times of
Moses there were no historical records in Greece Chaldea Phoenicia
Egypt or Assyria No other historian lived so remote as Moses He was five
hundred years before Sanconiathan and more than a thousand years before
Manetho He has been called the father of history Men have claimed that
astronomical calculations carry us farther back but this claim has been
successfully refuted by the calculations of Bedford There is a fact upon
record in Gillieas history of Greece that confirms Bedfordas calculations
This man says After Alexander conquered Babylon he eagerly demanded the
astronomical calculations that had been preserved in that ancient capital
about nineteen centuries and ordered them faithfully transcribed and
handed to Aristotle who was the preceptor of this prince They extended
back twenty two hundred and thirtyfour years behind the Christian era
There is no reliable history so ancient as the writings of Moses All the
efforts between Moses and David are without regular formaa mass of
rearranged tradition both fabulous and corrupt long after the times of
David the pages of writers regarded authentic are loaded with absurd and
disgusting fictions
Nimrodas kingdom was Babel and he was a tyrant instigating war and
bloodshed everywhere laying the nations under tribute and transmitting
his tyrannical spirit and powers from son to son until the Egyptians
drove his descendants into Canaan and Joshua drove them into Greece Ninus
inherited the spirit of his father and the history of his empire until
it was overthrown by the Babylonians and Medes is a history of absolute
Assyrian despotism
The Babylonian Empire was no better from the revolt of Nebopolassar to its
destruction by Cyrus Egypt and Persia were also equally deprived of the
blessings of civil liberty Greece and Rome were in no better condition
with the exceptions of a few restrictions consequent upon Greece being
controlled by established customs and Rome by the Senate These nations
were comparatively free but their freedom did not grow out of a
comprehension of the rights of their citizens
The Jewish Republic is the first ancient government where the people
exerted any proper influence in state affairs It is worthy of special
consideration that the Jewish laws were adapted to civil liberty in an age
when human rights were so little understood There is no one work so full
of the great principles of civil wisdom as the Pentateuch and the history
of Judah and Israel They were free in choosing their form of government
free in the establishment of their laws free in the fact that their laws
governed and not men Their form of government was republican with
healthy limitations Twelve tribes were united in one great republic like
so many confederated states bound together for purposes of defence At
first God was their king After awhile they desired another king and
their form of government was changed to a limited monarchy upon their own
request Their kings did not enter upon their duties until they were
accepted and crowned by the people and then they were restricted in their
power by sworn stipulations
Bad men do not make good citizens There never was a nation of infidels or
idolaters existing as such in the enjoyment of freedom Holland was free
as long as she was virtuous She flourished as a republic produced great
and learned statesmen she became corrupt and infidelity banished her
glory
When Perrier of France the successor of Lafayette in the office of Prime
Minister to Louis Phillipe was on his death bed he exclaimed with much
emphasis and zeal aFrance must have religionaaman must be governed by
moral truth or by despotic power Liberty does not flourish without
morality nor morality without the religion of the Bible The love of law
the love of wisdom the love of benevolent institutions and the love of
virtue makes a people free When these are absent tyrants are present
When a nation becomes corrupt liberty degenerates into parties and
factions until the stubborn necessity of the strong arm of despotism makes
its appearance to control the passions of men If pride selfishness love
of gold thirst for power and licentiousness are not controlled liberty
will die It may be truthfully said that the hightoned principles of
Bible morality are necessary to the good of all classes These and only
these will unite a people in one grand national brotherhood wiping out
its factions and hatred extinguishing party spirit and bringing all the
parts into one great whole Many minds are so opposed to the Bible that
they are inclined to oppose any government based upon its contents This
is a fearful current and we should always watch against being carried
away upon its turbid waters Ours is a Christian land and we shall be a
free people as long as we remain a Christian people While the Bible is
loved and honored our freedom will continue beyond this there is nothing
to hinder us from degenerating into slavery All great struggles in
Christian lands have been great moral and political struggles
LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE
This phase of the question rises very high in our estimation for we have
been taught to regard the rights of conscience and to esteem them above
all other rights in a free country There can be no civil liberty where
the rights of conscience are ignored The teachings of the Bible are
opposed to all interference by law with manas religious faith and worship
Religious liberty asks for no laws meddling with the rights of conscience
Such laws whether of tolerance or of intolerance are always in conflict
with the spirit of the religion of Christ for it asks for the soulas
free voluntary service As American citizens we ask at the hands of our
Government to be protected in common with all other citizens in the
free exercise of the rights of conscience We ask no interference with
religion by law and we apprehend none in our country If our religion
cannot take care of itself by the force of its own merits it must
perish
Rivers of blood have been offered upon the altar of a blind intolerance
Look at Antiochus sacking the city of Jerusalem and laying the country
waste Look at the slaughter of the infants of Bethlehem under Herodas
jurisdiction In many ages of the world religious intolerance has been the
fruitful source of misery and bloodshed
The religion of the Bible does not rest itself upon the authority of man
much less is it responsible for the cruel results of wicked efforts to
establish or overthrow it by law Causes outside of Christianity in the
hands of wicked men are responsible for every drop of blood that has been
shed in the name of our holy religion Christianity has nothing to fear in
our country as long as our lawmakers remember that their whole duty
consists not in making or unmaking rights or religion but in making laws
protecting all in the enjoyment of their rights The principles of
religious liberty set forth in the Bible are the following First the
word of God is the only source of authority in religious matters Neither
tradition nor remote antiquity nor ecclesiastical decisions nor
statutes but the Bible is supreme in our religion Second the Bible
allows and demands the right of private judgment in all matters of faith
and duty This is based upon the welldefined principles of individual and
personal responsibility aLet every man prove his own worka
The true and intelligent Christian has always been opposed to
ecclesiastical establishments by law and the authority of the state to
produce unity of faith and worship In all such matters we are responsible
to God alone His authority is all that is needed in order to the soulas
own free service and this is the only acceptable worship The third great
principle of religious liberty is this the Bible contains the only
infallible standard of faith and worship and its author is the only
infallible judge The Bible gives to no man or set of men dominion over
the human conscience but on the contrary lays the solemn injunction upon
each individual aProve all things and hold fast that which is gooda The
direction of Christ is in these living lines aCall no man master for one
is your master even Christa Every manas own works are the only true
expositor of his character because they are the fruits of the affections
which point him out as an enemy or as a friend of righteousness
The man who abuses the right of private judgment has a fearful account to
renderalet him see to that If he receives not the truth in the love of it
that he may be saved it is at his own peril The field of investigation
is the place where Christianity has won her most splendid victories She
has always lost when wicked men have called in the aid of the secular arm
for it is a very great error to suppose that you can deal successfully
with a manas spiritual nature by such forces it was not made for such
government By the secular arm you may force a wicked man to be a
hypocrite but you cannot make him a Christian in that way for you cannot
reach his understanding nor give life to his conscience by any such
means
There are two extremes however which we must carefully avoid First
that it is a matter of total indifference what religious principles a man
adopts and what form of worship he prefers The Bible contains essential
principlesaprinciples which constitute the essence of the gospel of Christ
which must be received loved and obeyed in order to the enjoyment of the
promises of salvation The sentiment that it matters not what a man
believes is no part of the religious liberty which the Bible inculcates
Such a sentiment is everywhere discouraged and denounced A forcible
writer said Keep clear of uncommon pretensions to charity Believe the
love of God and be satisfied with his charity and never dream of making
an improvement upon his character
The other extreme is to have no charity at all There are many things
about which men may safely differ but they are neither precepts to be
obeyed nor facts to be believed Differences may exist in opinions but
not in facts to be believed nor in commands to be obeyed Christians are
such in virtue of faith in Christ and obedience to his commandments
Wherever the minds of men have been brought under the power of the
Christian religion there they have been the devoted friends of such
liberty Such were the adherents of Luther in Germany the Lollards in
England and the adherents of Knox in Scotland Such was the case with
Holland when her republican virtues learning and piety moral and
literary institutions made her famous throughout the earth aWhere the
spirit of the Lord is there is libertya One of the most erroneous
objections to Christianity is that it is calculated to subject the many to
the few but its spirit and tendency is to bring all both the rich and
poor on one common level It pronounces temporal circumstances matters of
no consequence all men creatures of God made of one blood having a
common nature subject to common sufferings common dependence and
responsibilities It teaches us to adefraud no mana to acorrupt no mana
to alove our enemiesa to apray for those who despitefully use usa to
adisregard external distinctionsa In Christ there is neither Jew nor
Greek bond nor free male nor female but all are one The poor are
exalted and the rich are humbled Tholuck says aThe cultivated heathen
were offended at Christianity because the higher classes could no longer
have precedence of the common peoplea A religion which teaches that all
are upon one grand level under its influences will certainly teach us that
all are equal in the presence of the law Christianity is not only a
stranger to despotism but denounces it in the plainest terms Its great
founder said aWhosoever will be great among you let him be your servant
and whosoever will be chief let him be your ministera What greater
calamity could we experience than the loss of the last copy of the New
Testament Who would bring over the world once more the darkness of
Paganism Who would have our Government put on Roman character Who would
have us foster the basest passions of men Who would throw the human
intellect back into a state of uncertainty respecting a future existence
and the manner of securing its blessedness Who would dry up the living
fountains of joy which have been opened to us in the gospel Who would
destroy the motive power of our religion and wither its fruits of
righteousness Who would rob the bereaved heart of its consolations and
provoke anew the tears of the mourner which have been wiped away Who
would go to the widow and say Go and visit the grave of your loved one
and weep without hope Yes weep with the terrible thought that this
parting is to last forever Weep with trembling and at last step into the
grave with awful uncertainty to learn all there and never bring back the
secret Who are they who would restore to death its sting and to the grave
its victory What victories have they ever achieved for our humanity No
calculations could measure the sacrifice it would cost to part with the
Bible forever Wicked men would toll its funeral while the innocent ones
of earth would bathe in tears and turn away in sorrow Let us never
persecute those unfortunate men who are opposing the truth of our religion
on account of the errors of the creeds of our fathers Let us always avoid
a spirit of despotism and persecution because it is dishonorable If
there must be persecution let truth be the victim Error is not worthy of
the honor that martyrs bear
It is better that we asuffer for welldoing than for illdoinga therefore
let us criticise ourselves severely but deal with others in love The
Bible is our authority in religion and the civil arm is our protection in
the state Religious freedom is oursamay it long remain the glory of our
country In comparison with this freedom all else is mere illusion You
may enjoy all the freedom that this world can give and if you are slaves
to sin you are miserable slaves to a cruel master The intellectual and
moral condition of the soul constituting its highest glory is a liberty
worthy of the name Such an one in a very important sense is free
indeed free in solitude free in poverty free in abundance free in
life free in death free everywhere and forever free
THE ORTHODOXY OF ATHEISM AND INGERSOLISM BY REV S L TYRRELL
aHail human liberty there is no Goda Such is the exulting song of many a
human heart when bewildering metaphysics or superficial science has
crowded from its convictions faith in the Deity and his moral government
Few men have reached the pure unclouded heights of religion and morality
where the unselfish love of the holy and the right for their own inherent
excellence forms the controlling motive of their conduct regardless of
penalty or reward Humanity is yet on the low moral plane where penal
laws human or divine are the most potent forces in regulating human
life Hence the sad fact appears that when theism seems most successfully
assailed we hear from many quarters illconcealed rustlings of exultation
at the welcome loosening of the bonds of morality and religion It seems
to be overlooked that a very stern theological system may be quite
rationally evolved from atheistic premises and there is now a new and
very tempting field inviting some bold Calvin or Luther in the ranks of
positivism to write an immortal book with the original and attractive
title Ethics of Atheism The great offense of the scientific sciolistic
atheist is his lofty arrogance He complacently assumes the name of
Infallible Wisdom He aunderstands all mysteriesa his mental telescope
sweeps eternity afrom everlasting to everlastinga his microscopic vision
pierces the secrets of creationasees the beauty and order of all
celestial worlds emerge from fiery chaotic dustaby the fortunate contact
of cooling cinders of the right chemical properties and temperature he
secretes and hatches into life an egg or cell of throbbing protoplasm to
this pulsating mass of jelly there comes from the unconscious abyss at
length a vague instinct a drowsy awakening of desire next a feeble gleam
of definite thought reason then faintly dawns and lo at last this fair
universe burst into glorious light clothed in surpassing loveliness
throbbing with love tender sympathy and sublime aspiration and all
through the magic potency of blind matter and unconscious force without
an architect or guide O wondrous matter could a God do more
O divine science sciolist we bless thy name thou hast delivered us
from the terrors of dogmatic fear Man is but dust and unto dust shall he
return alet us eat and drink for tomorrow we diea But ere we run riot
in the intoxication of our newborn freedom from divine law does not the
skeptical cautious scientific spirit admonish us to pause a moment and
look logically at another class of possible achievements of this
wonderworking material power In philosophical researches analogy is a
recognized and legitimate guide to truth Admitting then that pure
matter has done all that materialism claims it has done in the past let
us look by the light of analogy at other and graver possibilities it may
have wrought in its reckless unrestrained creations Time is a mighty
attribute of evolutionary divinities its power seems next to infinite In
a few millions of years Alexanders Bonapartes Bismarks Miltons Edisons
and Ingersols have been evolved from thoughtless chaos now if in limited
time for what are millions of years to eternity such majestic mental
forces have been developed from the inexhaustible storehouse of
intellectual nothingness why should bold mathematical science deem it a
athing incrediblea that in an eternity of time with an unlimited amount
of matter for capital and infinite space for a theater of action this
mindevolving force may not have generated beings of almost infinite
capacitiesaeven a monarch who sways a scepter over more worlds than
oneaEVEN A GOD Why should material philosophy cavil at the creeds which
teach a righteous judgment to come Have not the judicial elements of
oxygen carbon and hydrogen combined to organize on one planet at least
courts of equity and judgment seats and crystalized into prison walls and
handcuffs the gallows and the hangman Upon the established scientific
principle that natureas laws are uniform undeviating and universal in
their action does not the analogy of earthly tribunals logically
necessitate the belief that our globe is but a province of the infinite
empire governed by righteous laws of which enlightened human laws are a
partial revelation
Modern science teaches the oneness of the universe and the identity and
sameness of the matter composing it What then can be more strictly
scientific and demonstrable from materialistic premises than the vast
conclusion that uniform passive matter operated upon by the same
undeviating laws must in all worlds produce the same results and evolve
as it has on our planet intelligence in which a sense of right and
justice shall predominate and everywhere and in all time enact and
execute laws discriminating between right and wrong What astronomical
prediction then can be more certain of fulfillment than this moral
prophecy of the final eclipse of evil and ultimate triumph of the right
With no existing power to arrest or mitigate the sentence of this
relentless carboniferous judge how fearful may be the possible fate of
those who disregard the moral laws of protoplasm Matter has evolved a
Franklin and a Morse who learned to wield the lightningas power Why may
there not have been evolved in the infinite past a more profound
electrician who with his battery and etherial wires can shiver a planet
with his touch A marvelous powerathe human spiritahas gained a vast
control over the blind stubborn substances and forces that created it
and by its immaterial invisible will can in a limited degree overrule
the most imperious law of nature by throwing a stone into the air Is it
unscientific then or derogatory to the vaunted potency of matter to
affirm that the eternal ages may have developed an intelligent will that
can project a planet or sun as the human will and muscle project the
pebble Scoff not exalted sages at the weak terrors of those who tremble
at the dogma of a malignant devil consider that pity and compassion are
not the known chemical constituents of this soulless creator Where then
can we fix the limit of that unconscious fiendish force that evolved a
Nero and incarnated in human bodies the myriads of demoniac spirits that
walk the earth today Egotistical scientist sciolist calm the cyclone
quiet the engulphing earthquake blot from human history the records of
war pestilence famine the tales of St Bartholomew and the Inquisition
and then deny by material philosophy the possibility of even a Calvinistic
hell deny the personality of man because your microscope and scalpel can
not find a soul by dissecting the brain of the mathematician and then
deny a personal God because his spirit eludes the grasp of sealed
crucibles and can not be detected by digging in the earth with the spade
Deny the existence of conscious life and then in the light of reason and
science deny that the forces that generate life must from necessary law
work for its continuance and immortality Extreme materialism confidently
teaches the birth death and resurrection of planetary universes why
should such grand faith stagger at the theory of the resurrection of a
soul Where is the scientific absurdity of Renanas distant hope that this
mighty resurrection of dead worlds will embrace in its infinite scope the
awakening to consciousness the universal past consciousness of the
universe May not both theist and atheist find in this line of thought a
partial answer to the oft recurring modern prayer aHelp thou mine

THE SHASTERS AND VEDAS AND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT RELIGION ETC
Men who wish to be known as scientific skeptics and unbelievers often
boast that the abovementioned books are more worthy of respect than the
books of the Bible For the benefit of all who may not have access to
those books the following from Duffas India credited to the Shasters
may be of service in the search after truth
aBrahm produced an egg All the primary atoms qualities and principles
the seeds of future worlds that had been evolved from the substance of
Brahm were now collected together and deposited in the newly produced
egg And into it along with them entered the selfexistent himself
under the assumed form of Brahma and then he sat vivifying expanding
and combining the elements during four thousand three hundred millions of
solar years During this amazing period the wondrous egg floated like a
bubble on the water increasing constantly in size At length the supreme
who dwelt therein burst the shell of the stupendous egg and issued forth
under a new form with a thousand heads a thousand eyes and a thousand
arms Along with him issued another form huge and measureless which
speedily matured into the present glorious universeaaShasters
In Hindostan we may see on one hand the trident of Neptune the eagle of
Jupiter the satyrs of Bacchus the bow of Cupid and the chariot of the
Sun on the other we hear the cymbals of Rhea the songs of the Muses
and the pastoral tales of Apollo Nomius The Hindoos enumerate four grand
periods in the worldas history called yugs The first comprehends one
million seven hundred and twentyeight thousand years The second one
million two hundred and ninetysix thousand the third eight hundred and
sixtyfour thousand years and the fourth four hundred and twentythree
thousand years Four thousand nine hundred and thirtyseven of the last
yug expired in eighteen hundred and fortythree The incredibility of
their chronology will be seen at a glance if you recollect that it is
claimed that one of their sovereigns lived through the whole of the first
yug Veda is a generic name for their four oldest and most sacred books
containing simply a revelation directly from Brahma
Many unbelievers in this and the old world who have set themselves
against our Bible have indorsed the Vedas as scientific without so much
as having read or known one line in them These Vedas profess to go back
through maha yugs of 4320000 years of men A thousand of these maha
yugs or 4320000000 of years make a kalpa or one day of the life of
Brahma and his night is of equal length a hundred such days and nights
measure the time of his life
These books give as facts seven great continents separated by that many
rivers and seven mountainchains four hundred thousand miles high They
record a hundred sons to one king ten thousand to another and sixty
thousand to another These kings were in no danger from violating the
command to amultiply and replenish the eartha but there is one
difficulty at least about the records concerning the seventy thousand
and one hundred sons born to these three kings and that is this the
records say They were all born in a pumpkin and nourished in pans of
milk reduced to ashes by the curse of a sage and restored to life by the
waters of the Ganges Those same sacred books say The moon is fifty
thousand leagues higher than the sun and that it shines by its own light
and animates our body they say the sun goes behind the Someyra Mountains
and this makes the night they say these mountains are many thousand
miles high and are situated in the middle of our earth they say our
earth is flat and triangular having seven stories each one of peculiar
beauty having its own inhabitants and each one having a sea The first
story of earth they say is composed of honey the second is composed
of sugar the third of butter the fourth of wine and the whole
thing is carried upon the heads of elephants and when these shake
themselves earthquakes are produced Among the astronomical calculations
which confirm all this there are accounts of floods of waters rising to
the Polar star How is that for a flood
Infidel if you read this and remember that you have been guilty of
foisting the Vedas against the Hebrew Scriptures hide your face and do it
no more The Hindoos worship cats and monkeys and holy bulls and sticks
and stones They are yet sacrificing their infants in that sacred river
Ganges The car of Juggernaut atis said is yet rolling on its bloody
wheels and women are yet burned upon the dead bodies of their husbands
What is the trouble with those unfortunates Well they enjoy freedom from
the Bible freedom from the Bible God and freedom from the Protestant and
Catholic clergyathe freedom that the infidels of the United States concern
themselves so much about Give them what they plead for and it will not be
long until they will have more hell than they will love or worship
Infidels boast of the worth of the writings of Confucius and the religion
of the Chinese Let us look after their condition Here it is as given in
the Universal Vocabulary As they are esteemed by unbelievers so ancient
as to put to shame all others pretending to antiquity we must be allowed
to make the test of their religious and scientific tree by its fruits
First aIf a person be suspected of treason he is put to death in a slow
and painful manner all his relations in the first degree are beheaded
his female relations sold into slavery and all his connections residing
in his house are put to death If a physician treat the case of a patient
in any way different from established rules and the patient dies he is
treated as guilty of homicide though if on his trial it be shown that it
was a mere error he is redeemed from death but must quit his practice
forever When a debtor is unable to meet the demand of his creditor he
receives thirty blows and the same number may be repeated from time to
time till the debt is paid In case the creditor violently seize the
debtoras goods he is liable to eighty blows In order to the collection of
debts it is customary for creditors to enter the houses of their debtors
on the first day of the year and pronounce their claims with a loud voice
and continue there until they are reimbursed It is said that this teazing
proves a successful method of collecting debts inasmuch as the debtor
fearing that something may befall the creditor while in his house and
therefore suspicion fall on him he is moved to use all possible
endeavors to answer the demand Women are sold in marriage and the highest
bidder takes them Their government is patriarchial and despotic The
emperor is styled Holy Son of Heaven Sole Governor of the Earth Their
religion is paganisma
Zellas Encyclopedia gives the following items as true today aTheir
husbandry is to a great extent nullified by the rude and illadapted
implements employed therefor and also by the smallness of the farms
Hence agriculture as scientifically considered is but little advanceda
The form of government is strictly patriarchial The emperor who bears
the various euphuistic titles of the aBrother of the Sun and Moona
Teentsye or the aSun of Heavena Tahwangli or the aGreat
Emperora and Wansuyyay or the aLord of a Myriad Yearsa is regarded
as the father of his people and has unlimited power over all his
subjects The emperor is spiritual as well as temporal sovereign and as
high priest of the empire can alone with his immediate representatives
and ministers perform the great religious ceremonies The bamboo as the
chief instrument of government is applied without distinction to the
highest and lowest Chinese
The imperial palaces are of great extent consisting of a series of
courts with galleries and halls of audience beautifully painted The
temples differ greatly in form and size The ordinary temples or
josshouses consist each of one chamber containing an idol This
gentle reader is the storehouse of pagan idolatry to which some
unbelievers in Indiana and elsewhere resort for names or titles by which
to designate the houses of Christian worship in our own country How would
those men like to emigrate to China where they could have a language that
suits their taste and a literature and religion about which they have
boasted so much If Chinese government religion and literature and
science be so old as is claimed by Chinamen and by infidels in our
country and its age be the cause of its great superiority in religion and
science may we not thank the Lord that we are young
ANCIENT COSMOGONIES
The Mosaic method found in the first chapter of the book of Genesis is not
the method of physical science this seeks by induction after laws
principles and causes stepping backwards step by step seeking by the
light of physical science the character of that unit which lies at the
base of the whole series of all created things aThe world by wisdom knew
not Goda The truth of this statement is monumented by the literature of
the unbelievers of the nineteenth century Today men who refuse Bible
instruction talk of the unknown and the unknowable thus conceding that
their efforts as naturalists or anatural mena are not sufficient in
their results to disclose the character of the great first cause The same
great failure has been and ever will be made by all mere naturalists In
view of this fact it is well that Moses gives us at once the great first
cause in the phrase aIn the beginning God created the heavens and the
eartha There is in this sentence no limitation of time so there is room
here for astronomical ages cycle upon cycle There was time enough in
that beginning for the present system of planets to be arranged from a
single nebulous mass In it we have a picture of matter in a crude
condition without fixedness of form surrounded with darkness Then comes
the commencement of the great work of preparing our planet for the home of
man by the spirit of God moving over the chaos There is nothing in this
statement that should perplex any man unless he is that fool who asays in
his heart there is no Goda If the chaos here described was matter in a
