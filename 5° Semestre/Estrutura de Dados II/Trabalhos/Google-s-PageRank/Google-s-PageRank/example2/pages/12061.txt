Sidenote AD 211 au 964 Sidenote1 After this Antoninus
secured the entire power Nominally he ruled with his brother but in
reality alone and at once With the enemy he came to terms withdrew
from their country and abandoned the forts But his own people he
either dismissed as Papinianus the prefect or else killed as Euodus
his nurse Castor and his wife Plautilla and the latters brother
Plautius In Rome itself he also executed a man who was renowned for no
other reason than his profession which made him very conspicuous This
was Euprepes the charioteer he killed him when the man dared to show
enthusiasm for a cause that the emperor opposed So Euprepes died in
old age after having been crowned in an endless number of horseraces
He had won seven hundred and eightytwo of thema record equaled by
none other
Antoninus had first had the desire to murder his brother while his
father was still alive but had been unable to do so at that time
because of Severus or later on the road because of the legions The
men felt very kindly toward the younger son especially because in
appearance he was the very image of his father But when Antoninus
arrived in Rome he got rid of this rival also The two pretended to
love and commend each other but their actions proved quite the reverse
to be true and anybody could see that some catastrophe would result
from their relations This fact was recognized even prior to their
reaching Rome When it had been voted by the senate to sacrifice in
behalf of their harmony both to the other gods and to Harmony herself
the assistants made ready a victim to be sacrificed to Harmony and the
consul arrived to do the slaughtering yet he could not find them nor
could the assistants find the consul They spent nearly the whole night
looking for each other so that the sacrifice could not be performed on
that occasion The next day two wolves climbed the Capitol but were
chased away from that region one of them was next encountered somewhere
in the Forum and the other was later slain outside the pomerium This
is the story about those two animals
Sidenote2 It was Antoninuss wish to murder his brother at the
Saturnalia but he was not able to carry out his intention The danger
had already grown too evident to be concealed As a consequence there
were many violent meetings between the twoboth feeling that they were
being plotted againstand many precautionary measures were taken on
both sides As many soldiers and athletes abroad and at home day and
night were guarding Geta Antoninus persuaded his mother to send for
him and his brother and have them come along to her house with a view to
being reconciled Geta without distrust went in with him When they were
well inside some centurions suborned by Antoninus rushed in a body
Geta on seeing them had run to his mother and as he hung upon her neck
and clung to her bosom and breasts he was cut down bewailing his fate
and crying out Mother that bore me mother that bore me help I am
slain
Sidenote AD 212 au 965 Tricked in this way she beheld her son
perishing by most unholy violence in her very lap and as it were
received his death into her womb whence she had borne him She was all
covered with blood so that she made no account of the wound she had
received in her hand She might neither mourn nor weep for her son
although untimely he had met so miserable an end he was only
twentytwo years and nine months old on the contrary she was
compelled to rejoice and laugh as though enjoying some great piece of
luck All her words gestures and changes of color were watched with
the utmost narrowness She alone Augusta wife of the emperor mother
of emperors was not permitted to shed tears even in private over so
great a calamity
Sidenote3 Antoninus although it was evening took possession of
the legions after bawling all the way along the road that he had been
the object of a plot and was in danger On entering the fortifications
he exclaimed Rejoice fellowsoldiers for now I have a chance to
benefit you Before they heard the whole story he had stopped their
mouths with so many and so great promises that they could neither think
nor speak anything decent I am one of you he said it is on your
account alone that I care to live that so I may afford you much
happiness All the treasuries are yours Indeed he said this also I
pray if possible to live with you but if not at any rate to die with
you I do not fear death in any form and it is my desire to end my days
in warfare There should a man die or nowhere
To the senate on the following day he made various remarks and after
rising from his seat he went towards the door and said Listen to a
great announcement from me That the whole world may be glad let all
the exiles who have been condemned on any complaint whatever in any way
whatever be restored to full rights Thus did he empty the islands of
exiles and grant pardon to the worst condemned criminals but before
long he had the isles full again
Sidenote4 The Caesarians and the soldiers that had been with Geta
were suddenly put to death to the number of twenty thousand men and
women alike wherever in the palace any of them happened to be
Antoninus slew also various distinguished men among them Papinianus
While the Pretorians accused Papianus sic and Patruinus
Footnote This is Valerius Patruinus for certain actions
Antoninus allowed the complainants to kill them and added the
following remark I hold sway for your advantage and not for my
own therefore I defer to you both as accusers and as judges
He rebuked the murderer of Papinianus for using an axe instead of a
sword to give the finishing stroke
He had also desired to deprive of life Cilo his nurse and benefactor
who had served as prefect of the city during his fathers reign whom he
had also often called father The soldiers sent against him plundered
his silver plate his robes his money and everything else that
belonged to him Cilo himself they conducted along the Sacred Way
making the palace their destination where they prepared to give him his
quietus He had low slippers Footnote Reading Greek blahytast in the
place of the MS Greek chlhapast This emendation is favored by Cobet
Mnemosyne NS X p 211 and Naber Mnemosyne NS XVI p 113
on his feet since he had chanced to be in the bath when apprehended
and wore an abbreviated tunic The men rent his clothing open and
disfigured his face so that the people and the soldiers stationed in
the city made clamorous objections Therefore Antoninus out of respect
and fear for them met the party and shielding Cilo with his cavalry
cloakhe was wearing military garbcried out Insult not my father
Strike not my nurse The tribune charged with slaying him and the
soldiers in his contingent lost their lives nominally for making plots
but really for not having killed their victim
Sidenote5 But Antoninus was so anxious to appear to love Cilo
that he declared Those who have plotted against him have plotted
against me Commended for this by the bystanders he proceeded Call
me neither Hercules nor the name of any other god not that he was
unwilling to be termed a god but because he wished to do nothing worthy
of a god He was naturally capricious in all matters and would bestow
great honors upon people and then suddenly disgrace them quite without
reason He would save those who least deserved it and punish those whom
one would never have expected
Julianus Asper was a man by no means contemptible on account of his
education and good sense as well He exalted him together with his
sons and after Asper had walked the streets surrounded by I dont know
how many fasces he without warning insulted him outrageously and
dismissed him to his native place Footnote Ie Tusculum with abuse
and in mighty trepidation Laetus too he would have disgraced or even
killed had this man not been extremely sick So the emperor before the
soldiers called his sickness wicked because it did not allow him to
display wickedness in one more case
Again he made way with Thrasea Priscus a person second to none in
family or intelligence
Many others also previously friends of his he put to death
Sidenote6
Nay I could not recite nor give the names all over
Footnote From Homers Iliad II verse 488 of the distinguished men
whom he killed without any right Dio because the slain were very well
known in those days even makes a list of them For me it suffices to
say that he crushed the life out of everybody he chose without
exception
whether the man was guilty or whether he was not
Footnote From Homers Iliad XV verse 137 and that he simply
mutilated Rome by rendering it bereft of excellent men Antoninus was
allied to three races And he possessed not a single one of their good
points but included in himself all their vices The lightness the
cowardice and recklessness of Gaul were his the roughness and cruelty
of Africa the abominations of Syria whence he was on his mothers
side Veering from slaughter to sports he pursued his murderous
course no less in the latter Of course one would pay no attention to
an elephant rhinoceros tiger and hippotigris being killed in the
theatre but he took equal pleasure in having gladiators shed the
greatest amount of one anothers blood One of them Bato he forced
to fight three successive men on the same day and then when Bato
met death at the hands of the last he honored him with a conspicuous
burial
Sidenote7 He had Alexander on the brain to such an extent that he
used certain weapons and cups which purported to have belonged to the
great conqueror and furthermore he set up many representations of him
both among the legions and in Rome itself He organized a phalanx
sixteen thousand men of Macedonians alone named it Alexanders
phalanx and equipped it with the arms which warriors had used in his
day These were a helmet of raw oxhide a threeply linen breastplate
a bronze shield long pike short spear high boots sword Not even
this however satisfied him but he called his hero The Eastern
Augustus Once he wrote to the senate that Alexander had come on earth
again in the body of the Augustus Footnote Antoninus meant
himself so that when he had finished his own brief existence he might
enjoy a larger life in the emperors person The socalled Aristotelian
philosophers he hated bitterly wishing even to burn their books and he
abolished the common messes they had in Alexandria and all the other
privileges they enjoyed his grievance as stated was the tradition
that Aristotle had been an accomplice in the death of Alexander
This was the way he behaved in those matters And by Jupiter he took
around with him numbers of elephants that in this respect too he
might seem to be imitating Alexander or rather perhaps Dionysus
Sidenote8 On Alexanders account he was fond of all the
Macedonians Once after praising a Macedonian tribune because the latter
had shown agility in jumping upon his horse he enquired of him first
From what country are you Then learning that he was a Macedonian he
pursued What is your name Having thereupon heard that it was
Antigonus he further questioned How was your father called When
the fathers name was found to be Philip he declared I have all my
desire He straightway bestowed upon him the whole series of exalted
military honors and before a great while appointed him one of the
senators with the rank of an expraetor
There was another man who had no connection with Macedonia but had
committed many dreadful crimes and for this reason was tried before him
in an appealed case His name proved to be Alexander and when the
orator accusing him said repeatedly the bloodthirsty Alexander the
goddetested Alexander the emperor became angry as if he were
personally slandered and spoke out If Alexander doesnt suit you you
may regard yourself as dismissed
Sidenote9 Now this great Alexandrophile Antoninus kept many
men about him alleging reasons after reasons all fictitious and wars
upon wars He had also this most frightful characteristic that he was
fond of spending money not only upon the soldiers but for all other
projects with one sole end in viewto strip despoil and grind down
all mankind and the senators by no means least In the first place
there were gold crowns that he kept demanding on the constant pretext
that he had conquered some enemy or other I am not speaking about the
actual manufacture of the crownsfor what does that amount tobut
the great sums of money constantly being given under that name by the
cities for the crowning as it is called of their emperors Then
there was the provisions which we were all the time levying in great
abundance from all quarters sometimes seizing them without compensation
and sometimes spending a little something on them all this supply he
presented or else peddled to the soldiers And the gifts which he
demanded from wealthy individuals and from states And the taxes both
the new ones which he published and the ten per cent tax that he
instituted in place of the twenty per cent to apply to the emancipation
of slaves to bequests left to any one and to all gifts for he
abolished in such cases the right of succession and exemption from taxes
which had been accorded to those closely related to persons deceased
This accounts for his giving the title of Romans to all the men in his
empire Nominally it was to honor them but his real purpose was to get
an increased income by such means since foreigners did not have to pay
most of those taxes But aside from all these we were also compelled to
build at our own expense all sorts of dwellings for him whenever he took
a trip from Rome and costly lodgings in the middle of even the very
shortest journeys Yet not only did he never live in them but he had no
idea of so much as looking at a single one Moreover without receiving
any appropriation from him we constructed huntingtheatres and
racecourses at every point where he wintered or expected to winter
They were all torn down without delay and apparently the sole purpose of
their being called into existence was to impoverish us
Sidenote10 The emperor himself kept spending the money upon the
soldiers as we said and upon beasts and horses He was forever
killing great collections of wild beasts of horses and also of
domestic animals forcing us to contribute the majority of them though
now and then he bought a few One day he slew a hundred boars at once
with his own hands He raced also in chariots and then he would wear
the Blue costume In all undertakings he was exceedingly hotheaded and
exceedingly fickle and besides this he possessed the rascality of his
mother and of the Syrians to which race she belonged He would put up
some kind of freedman or other wealthy person as director of games
merely that in this occupation too the man might spend money From
below he would make gestures of subservience to the audience with his
whip and would beg for gold pieces like one of the lowliest citizens He
said that he used the same methods of chariotdriving as the Sun god
and he took pride in the fact Accordingly during the whole extent of
his reign the whole earth so far as it yielded obedience to him was
plundered Hence the Romans once at a horserace uttered this among
other cries We are destroying the living in order to bury the dead
The emperor would often say No man need have money but me and I want
it to bestow it on the soldiers Once when Julia chided him for his
great outlays upon them and said No longer is any resource either
just or unjust left to us he replied exhibiting his sword Cheer
up mother for as long as we have this money is not going to fail
us
Sidenote11 To those who flattered him however he distributed
possessions and money
Julius Paulus Footnote Undoubtedly a mistake for the Julius
Paulinus subsequently mentioned was a man of consular rank
who was a great chatterer and joker and would not refrain from
aiming his shafts of wit at the very emperors therefore Severus
had him taken into custody though without constraints When he
still continued even under guard to make the sovereigns the
objects of his jests Severus sent for him and swore that he
would cut off his head But the man replied Yes you can cut it
off but as long as I have it neither you nor I can restrain
it and so Severus laughed and released him
He granted to Julius Paulinus twentyfive myriads because the man who
was a jester had been led though involuntarily to make a joke upon
him Paulinus had said that he actually resembled a man getting angry
for somehow he was always assuming a fierce expression Footnote None
of the editors any more than the casual reader has been able to find
anything of a sidesplitting nature in this joke The trouble is of
course that the utterance sounds like a plain statement of fact
Caracallas natural disposition was harsh and irritable Some have
changed the word man to Pan in anger but without gaining very
much I offer for what it is worth the suggestion that a wellknown
truth especially in the case of personal characteristics may sound
very amusing when pronounced in a quizzical or semiironical fashion by
a person possessing sufficient vis comica Thus we may conceive
Paulinus a professional jester on meeting Antoninus to have blurted
out in a tone of mock surprise Why anybody would really think you are
angry You look so cross all the time There would then be a point in
the jest but the point would lie not in the words but in the voice and
features of the speaker Apart from this explanation of the possible
humor of the remark an excerpt of Peter Patricius Exc Vat 143 gives
us to understand that it would be taken as a compliment by Antoninus
from the mouth of a person to whom he was accustomed to accord some
liberties since Antoninus made a point of maintaining at all times this
character of harshness and abruptnessAntoninus made no account of
anything excellent he never learned anything of the kind as he himself
admitted So it was that he showed a contempt for us who possessed
something approaching education Severus to be sure had trained him in
all pursuits bar none that tended to inculcate virtue whether
physical or mental so that even after he became emperor he went to
teachers and studied philosophy most of the day He also took oil
rubbings without water and rode horseback to a distance of seven hundred
and fifty stades Moreover he practiced swimming even in rough water
In consequence of this Antoninus was as you might say strong but he
paid no heed to culture since he had never even heard the name of it
Still his language was not bad nor did he lack judgment but he showed
in almost everything a keen appreciation and talked very readily For
through his authority and recklessness and his habit of saying right out
without reflection anything at all that occurred to him and not being
ashamed to air his thoughts he often stumbled upon some felicitous
expression But the same Antoninus made many mistakes through his
headstrong opinions It was not enough for him to know everything he
wanted to be the only one who knew anything It was not enough for him
to have all power he would be the only one with any power Hence it
was that he employed no counselor and was jealous of such men as knew
something worth while He never loved a single person and he hated all
those who excelled in anything and most did he hate those whom he
affected most to love Many of these he destroyed in some way or other
Of course he had many men murdered openly but others he would send to
provinces not suited to them fatal to their physical condition having
an unwholesome climate thus while pretending to honor them
excessively he quietly got rid of them exposing such as he did not
like to excessive heat or cold Hence though he spared some in so far
as not to put them to death yet he subjected them to such hardships
that the stain Footnote This is very likely an incorrect translation of
an incorrect reading The various editors of Dio have a few substitutes
to propose but as all the interpretations seem to me extremely
lumbering I have turned the MS Greek chelidoysthai taken as a
passive in a way that may be not quite beyond the bounds of
possibility The noun Greek chelhist like the English stain often
passes from its original sense of blemish to that of the consequent
disgrace of murder still rested on him
The above describes him in general terms
Sidenote AD 213 Sidenote12 Now we shall state what sort
of person he showed himself in war Abgarus king of the Osrhoeni when
he had once got control of the kindred tribes inflicted the most
outrageous treatment upon his superiors Nominally he was compelling
them to change to Roman customs but in fact he was making the most of
his authority over them in an unjustifiable way He tricked the king of
the Osrhoeni Abgarus inducing him to visit him as a friend and then
arrested and imprisoned him This left Osrhoene without a ruler and he
subdued it
The king of the Armenians had a dispute with his own children and
Antoninus summoned him in a friendly letter with the avowed purpose of
making peace between them he treated these princes in the same fashion
as he had Abgarus The Armenians however instead of yielding to him
had recourse to arms and not one of them thereafter would trust him in
the slightest particular Thus he was brought by experience to
understand how great the penalty is for an emperors practicing deceit
toward friends The same ruler assumed the utmost credit for the fact
that at the death of Vologaesus king of the Parthians his children
proceeded to fight about the sovereignty what was purely accidental he
pretended had come about through his own connivance He ever took
vehement delight in the actions and dissensions of the brothers and
generally in the mutual slaughter of foreign potentates He did not
hesitate either to write to the senate regarding the rulers of the
Parthians who were brothers and at variance that the brothers quarrel
would work great harm to the Parthian state Just as if barbarian
governments could be destroyed by such procedure and yet the Roman state
had been preserved Just as if it had not been on the contrary almost
utterly overthrown It was not merely that the great sums of blood money
given under such conditions to the soldiers for his brothers murder
served to demoralize mankind in addition vast numbers of citizens had
information laid against themnot only those who had sent the brother
letters or had brought him presents Footnote Reading Greek
dorophorhesantest Reimar for the MS Greek doruphoraesantes when
he was still Caesar or again after he had become emperor but all the
rest who had never had any dealings with him If anybody even so much as
wrote the name of Geta or spoke it that was the end of him then and
there Hence the poets no longer used it even in comedies Footnote
Geta was a common name for slaves in Latin comedy It came into Rome
through Greek channels and was originally merely the national adjective
applied to a tribe of northern barbarians The property too of all
those in whose wills the name was found written was confiscated
Many of his acts were committed with a view to getting money And he
exhibited his hatred for his dead brother by abolishing the honor paid
to his birthday by getting angry at the stones which had supported his
images and by melting up the coinage that displayed his features Not
even this sufficed him but more than ever from this time he began his
practice of unholy rites and often forced others to share his pollution
by making a kind of annual offering to his brothers Manes
Sidenote AD 213 au 966 Sidenote13 Though
holding such views and behaving in such a way with regard to the
latters murder he took delight in the dissension of the
barbarian brothers on the ground that the Parthians would suffer
some great injury as a result of it
The Celtic nations however afforded him neither pleasure nor any
pretence of cleverness or courage but proved him to be nothing more nor
less than a cheat a simpleton and an arrant coward Antoninus made a
campaign among the Alamanni and wherever he saw a spot suitable for
habitation he would order There let a fort be erected there let a
city be built To those spots he applied names relating to himself yet
the local designations did not get changed for some of the people were
unaware of the new appellations and others thought he was joking
Consequently he came to entertain a contempt for them and would not keep
his hands off this tribe even but whereas he had been saying that he
had come as an ally he accorded them treatment to be expected of a most
implacable foe He called a meeting of their men of military age under
promise that they were to receive pay and then at a given signalhis
raising aloft his own shieldhe had them surrounded and cut down he
also sent cavalry around and arrested all others not present
Antoninus commended in the senate by means of a letter Pandion a
fellow who had previously been an understudy of charioteers but in the
war against the Alamanni drove his chariot for him and in this capacity
was his comrade and fellow soldier And he asserted that he had been
saved by this man from a portentous danger and was not ashamed to evince
greater gratitude to him than to the soldiers whom in their turn he
regarded as our superiorsFootnote There is a gap of a word or two
here Dindorf text filled by reading Greek helen hechon with
Boissevain
Some of the most distinguished men whom Antoninus slew he ordered to be
cast out unburied
He made a search for the tomb of Sulla and repaired it and reared a
cenotaph to Mesomedes who had written a compilation of citharoedic
modes He honored the latter because he was himself learning to sing to
the zither and the former because he was emulating his cruelty
Still in cases of necessity and urgent campaigns he was simple and
frugal toiling with painstaking care in menial offices as much as the
rest He trudged beside the soldiers and ran beside them not taking a
bath nor changing his clothing but helping them in every labor and
choosing absolutely the same food as they had Often he would send to
distinguished champions on the enemys side and challenge them to single
combat The details of generalship in which he certainly ought to have
been most versed he managed least well as if he thought that victory
lay in the performance of those services mentioned and not in this
science of commanding
Sidenote14 He conducted war also against a certain Celtic tribe
of Cenni These warriors are said to have assailed the Romans with the
utmost fierceness using their mouths to pull from their flesh the
missiles with which the Osrhoeni wounded them that they might give
their hands no respite in slaughtering the foe Nevertheless even they
after selling the name of defeat at a high figure made an agreement
with him to go into Germany on condition of being spared Their women
and those of the Alamanni all who were captured would not in truth
await a servile doom but when Antoninus asked them whether they
desired to be sold or slain chose the latter alternative Afterward as
they were offered for sale they all killed themselves and some of their
children as well Many also of the people dwelling close to the ocean
itself near the mouth of the Albis sent envoys to him and asked his
friendship when their real concern was to get money For after he had
done as they desired they would frequently attack him threatening to
begin a war and with all such he came to terms Even though his offer
was contrary to their principles yet when they saw the gold pieces they
were captivated To them he gave true gold pieces but the silver and
gold money with which he provided the Romans was alloyed He
manufactured the one of lead with a silver plating and the other of
bronze with a gold plating
Sidenote15 The same ruler published some of his devices
directly pretending that they were excellent and worthy of
commendation however base their actual character Other intentions he
rather unwillingly made known through the very precautions which he took
to conceal them as for example in the case of the money He plundered
the whole land and the whole sea and left nothing whatever unharmed The
chants of the enemy made Antoninus frenzied and beside himself hearing
which some of the Alamanni asserted that they had used charms to put him
out of his mind He was sick in body partly with ordinary and partly
with private diseases and was sick also in mind suffering from
distressing visions and often he thought he was being pursued by his
father and his brother armed with swords Therefore he called up
spirits to find some remedy against them among others the spirit of his
father and of Commodus But not one would speak a word to him except
Commodus Geta so they say attended Severus though unsummoned Yet
not even he offered any suggestion to relieve the emperor but on the
contrary terrified him the more This is what he said
Draw nearer judgment which the gods demand of thee Footnote
Emended by Fabricius and Reiske from a corruption in the MS
for Severus
then something else and finally
having in secret places a disease hard to heal
For letting these facts become public many suffered unseemly outrage
But to Antoninus not one of the gods gave any response pertaining to the
healing of either his body or his mind although he showered attention
upon all the most distinguished shrines This showed in the clearest
light that they regarded not his offerings nor his sacrifices but only
his purposes and his deeds He got no aid from Apollo Grannus Footnote
Grannus was really a Celtic god merely identified with Apollo He was
honored most in Germany and Dacia also known in Rhaetia Noricum and
inasmuch as many inscriptions bearing his name have been found near the
Danube it may probably be conjectured that he had a temple of some
importance in that vicinity For further details see Pauly II p 46
Roscher I col 1738 nor Asclepius nor Serapis in spite of his many
supplications and his unwearying persistence Even when abroad he sent
to them prayers and sacrifices and votive offerings and many runners
traveled to them daily carrying things of the sort He also went
himself hoping to prevail by appearing in person and he performed all
the usual practices of devotees but he obtained nothing that would
contribute to health
Sidenote16 While declaring that he was the most scrupulous of all
mankind he ran to an excess of bloodguiltiness killing four of the
vestal virgins one of whomso far as he was ablehe had forcibly
outraged For latterly all his sexual power had disappeared as a result
of which it was reported that he satisfied his vileness in a different
way and associated with him were others of similar inclinations who
