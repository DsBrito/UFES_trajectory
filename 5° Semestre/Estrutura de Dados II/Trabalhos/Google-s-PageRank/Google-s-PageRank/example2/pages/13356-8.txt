A MEMORIAL SKETCH
As thisThe Captains TollGateis the last of the works of Frank R
Stockton that will be given to the public it is fitting that it be
accompanied by some account of the man whose bright spirit illumined
them all It is proper also that something be said of the stories
themselves of the circumstances in which they were written the
influences that determined their direction and the history of their
evolution It seems appropriate that this should be done by the one who
knew him best the one who lived with him through a long and beautiful
life the one who walked hand in hand with him along the whole of a
wonderful road of everchanging scenes now through forests peopled with
fairies and dryads griffins and wizards now skirting the edges of an
ocean with its strange monsters and remarkable shipwrecks now on the
beaten track of European tourists sharing their novel adventures and
amused by their mistakes now resting in lovely gardens imbued with
human interest now helping the young to make happy homes for
themselves now sympathizing with the old as they look longingly toward
a heavenly home and oftenest perhaps watching girls and young men as
they were trying to work out the problems of their lives All this and
much more crowded the busy years until the Angel of Death stood in the
path and the journey was ended
In regard to the present storyThe Captains TollGatealthough it is
now after his death first published it was all written and completed by
Mr Stockton himself No other hand has been allowed to add to or to
take from it Mr Stockton had so strong a feeling upon the literary
ethics involved in such matters that he once refused to complete a book
which a popular and brilliant author whose style was thought to
resemble his own had left unfinished Mr Stockton regarded the
proposed act in the light of a sacrilege The book he said should be
published as the author left it Knowing this fact readers of the
present volume may feel assured that no one has been permitted to tamper
with it Although the last book by Mr Stockton to be published it is
not the last that he wrote He had completed The Captains TollGate
and was considering its publication when he was asked to write another
novel dealing with the buccaneers He had already produced a book
entitled Buccaneers and Pirates of our Coasts The idea of writing a
novel while the incidents were fresh in his mind pleased him and he put
aside The Captains TollGate as the other bookKate Bonnetwas
wanted soon and he did not wish the two works to conflict in
publication Steve Bonnet the crazyheaded pirate was a historical
character and performed the acts attributed to him But the charming
Kate and her lover and Ben Greenaway were inventions
Francis Richard Stockton born in Philadelphia in 1834 was on his
fathers side of purely English ancestry on his mothers side there
was a mixture of English French and Irish When he began to write
stories these three nationalities were combined in them the peculiar
kind of inventiveness of the French the point of view and the humor
that we find in the old English humorists and the capacity of the Irish
for comical situations
Soon after arriving in this country the eldest son of the first American
Stockton settled in Princeton NJ and founded that branch of the
family while the father with the other sons settled in Burlington
County in the same State and founded the Burlington branch of the
family from which Frank R Stockton was descended On the female side
he was descended from the Gardiners also of New Jersey His was a
family with literary proclivities His father was widely known for his
religious writings mostly of a polemical character which had a
powerful influence in the denomination to which he belonged His
halfbrother much older than Frank was a preacher of great eloquence
famous a generation ago as a pulpit orator
When Frank and his brother John two years younger came to the age to
begin life for themselves they both showed such decided artistic genius
that it was thought best to start them in that direction and to have
them taught engraving an art then held in high esteem Frank chose
wood and John steel engraving Both did good work but their hearts
were not in it and as soon as opportunity offered they abandoned
engraving John went into journalism became editorially connected with
prominent newspapers and had won a foremost place in his chosen
profession when he was cut off by death at a comparatively early age

Frank chose literature He had while in the engraving business written
a number of fairy tales some of which had been published in juvenile
magazines also a few short stories and quite an ambitious long story
which was published in a prominent magazine He was then sufficiently
well known as a writer to obtain without difficulty a place on the
staff of Hearth and Home a weekly New York paper owned by Orange Judd
and conducted by Edward Eggleston Mrs Mary Mapes Dodge had charge of
the juvenile department and Frank went on the paper as her assistant
Not long after Scribners Monthly was started by Charles Scribner the
elder in conjunction with Roswell Smith and JG Holland Later Mr
Smith and his associates formed The Century Company and with this
company Mr Stockton was connected for many years first on the Century
Magazine which succeeded Scribners Monthly and afterward on St
Nicholas as assistant to Mrs Mary Mapes Dodge and still later when
he decided to give up editorial work as a constant contributor After a
few years he resigned his position in the company with which he had been
so pleasantly associated in order to devote himself exclusively to his
own work By this time he had written and published enough to feel
justified in taking what seemed to his friends a bold and even rash
step because so few writers then lived solely by the pen He was never
very strong physically he felt himself unable to do his editorial work
and at the same time write out the fancies and stories with which his
mind was full This venture proved to be the wisest thing for him and
from that time his life was in great part in his books and he gave
to the world the novels and stories which bear his name
I have mentioned his fairy stories Having been a great lover of fairy
lore when a child he naturally fell into this form of story writing as
soon as he was old enough to put a story together He invented a goodly
number and among them the TingaLing stories which were read aloud in
a boys literary circle and meeting their hearty approval were
subsequently published in The Riverside Magazine a handsome and popular
juvenile of that period and much later were issued by Hurd  Houghton
in a very pretty volume In regard to these he wrote long afterward as
follows
I was very young when I determined to write some fairy tales because my
mind was full of them I set to work and in course of time produced
several which were printed These were constructed according to my own
ideas I caused the fanciful creatures who inhabited the world of
fairyland to act as far as possible for them to do so as if they were
inhabitants of the real world I did not dispense with monsters and
enchanters or talking beasts and birds but I obliged these creatures
to infuse into their extraordinary actions a certain leaven of common
sense
It was about this time while very young that he and his brother
became ambitious to write stories poems and essays for the world at
large They sent their effusions to various periodicals with the result
common to ambitious youths all were returned They decided at last that
editors did not know a good thing when they saw it and hit upon a
brilliant scheme to prove their own judgment One of them selected an
extract from Paradise Regained as being not so well known as Paradise
Lost and sent it to an editor with the boys own name appended
expecting to have it returned with some of the usual disparaging
remarks which they would greatly enjoy But they were disappointed The
editor printed it in his paper thereby proving that he did know a good
thing if he did not know his Milton Mr Stockton was fond of telling
this story and it may have given rise to a report extensively
circulated that he tried to gain admittance to periodicals for many
years before he succeeded This is not true Some rebuffs he had of
coursesome with things which afterward proved great successesbut not
as great a number as falls to the lot of most beginners
The TingaLing tales proved so popular that Mr Stockton followed them
at intervals with long and short stories for the young which appeared in
various juvenile publications and were afterward published in book
formRoundabout Rambles Tales out of School A Jolly Fellowship
Personally Conducted The Story of Viteau The Floating Prince and
others Some years later after he had begun to write for older readers
he wrote a series of stories for St Nicholas ostensibly for children
but really intended for adults Children liked the stories but the
deeper meaning underlying them all was beyond the grasp of a childs
mind These stories Mr Stockton took very great pleasure in writing
and always regarded them as some of his best work and was gratified
when his critics wrote of them in that way They have become famous and
have been translated into several languages notably Old Pipes and the
Dryad The Bee Man of Orne and The Griffin and the Minor Canon This
last story was suggested by Chester Cathedral and he wrote it in that
venerable city The several tales were finally collected into a volume
under the title The Bee Man of Orne and Other Stories which is
included in the complete edition of his novels and stories During the
whole of his literary career Mr Stockton was an occasional contributor
of short stories and essays to The Youths Companion
Mr Stockton considered his career as an editor of great advantage to
him as an author In an autobiographical paper he writes
Longcontinued reading of manuscripts submitted for publication which
are almost good enough to use and yet not quite up to the standard of
the magazine can not but be of great service to any one who proposes a
literary career Bad work shows us what we ought to avoid but most of
us know or think we know what that is Fine literary work we get
outside the editorial room But the great mass of literary material
which is almost good enough to print is seen only by the editorial
reader and its lesson is lost upon him in a great degree unless he is
or intends to be a literary worker
The first house in which we set up our own household goods stood in
Nutley NJ We had with us an elderly attache of the Stockton family
as maidofallwork and to relieve her of some of her duties I went
into New York and procured from an orphans home a girl whom Mr
Stockton described as a middlesized orphan She was about fourteen
years old and proved to be a very peculiar individual with strong
characteristics which so appealed to Mr Stocktons sense of humor that
he liked to talk with her and draw out her opinions of things in
general and especially of the books she had read Her spare time was
devoted to reading books mostly of the bloodcurdling variety and she
read them to herself aloud in the kitchen in a very disjointed fashion
which was at first amusing and then irritating We never knew her real
name nor did the people at the orphanage She had three or four very
romantic ones she had borrowed from novels while she was with us for
she was very sentimental
Mr Stockton bestowed upon her the name of Pomona which is now a
household word in myriads of homes This extraordinary girl and some
household experiences induced Mr Stockton to write a paper for
Scribners Monthly which he called Rudder Grange This one paper was all
he intended to write but it attracted immediate attention was
extensively noticed and much talked about The editor of the magazine
received so many letters asking for another paper that Mr Stockton
wrote the second one and as there was still a clamor for more he
after a little time wrote others of the series Some time later they
were collected in a book For those interested in Pomona I will add
that while the girl was an actual personage with all the
characteristics given to her by her chronicler the woman Pomona was a
development in Mr Stocktons mind of the girl as he imagined she would
become for the original passed out of our lives while still a girl
Rudder Grange was Mr Stocktons first book for adult readers and a
good deal of comment has been made upon the fact that he had reached
middle life when it was published His biographers and critics assume
that he was utterly unknown at that time and that he suddenly jumped
into favor and they naturally draw the inference that he had until then
vainly attempted to get before the public This is all a misapprehension
of the facts It will be seen from what I have previously stated that
at this time he was already well known as a juvenile writer and not
only had no difficulty in getting his articles printed but editors and
publishers were asking him for stories He had made but few slight
attempts to obtain a larger audience That he confined himself for so
long a time to juvenile literature can be easily accounted for For one
thing it grew out of his regular work of constantly catering for the
young and thinking of them Then again editorial work makes urgent
demands upon time and strength and until freed from it he had not the
leisure or inclination to fashion stories for more exacting and critical
readers Perhaps too he was slow in recognizing his possibilities
Certain it is that the public were not slow to recognize him He did
however experience difficulties in getting the collected papers of
Rudder Grange published in book form I will quote his own account
which is interesting as showing how slow he was to appreciate the fact
that the public would gladly accept the writings of a humorist
The discovery that humorous compositions could be used in journals
other than those termed comic marked a new era in my work Periodicals
especially devoted to wit and humor were very scarce in those days and
as this sort of writing came naturally to me it was difficult until
the advent of Puck to find a medium of publication for writings of this
nature I contributed a good deal to this paper but it was only partly
satisfactory for articles which make up a comic paper must be terse and
short and I wanted to write humorous tales which should be as long as
ordinary magazine stories I had good reason for my opinion of the
gravity of the situation for the editor of a prominent magazine
declined a humorous story afterward very popular which I had sent him
on the ground that the traditions of magazines forbade the publication
of stories strictly humorous Therefore when I found an editor at last
who actually wished me to write humorous stories I was truly
rejoiced My first venture in this line was Rudder Grange And after
all I had difficulty in getting the series published in book form Two
publishers would have nothing to do with them assuring me that although
the papers were well enough for a magazine a thing of ephemeral nature
the bookreading public would not care for them The third publisher to
whom I applied issued the work and found the venture satisfactory
The bookreading public cared so much for this book that it would not
remain satisfied with it alone Again and again it demanded of the
author more about Pomona Euphemia and Jonas Hence The Rudder Grangers
Abroad and Pomonas Travels
The most famous of Mr Stocktons stories The Lady or the Tiger was
written to be read before a literary society of which he was a member
It caused such an interesting discussion in the society that he
published it in the Century Magazine It had no especial announcement
there nor was it heralded in any way but it took the public by storm
and surprised both the editor and the author All the world must love a
puzzle for in an amazingly short time the little story had made the
circuit of the world Debating societies everywhere seized upon it as a
topic it was translated into nearly all languages society people
discussed it at their dinners plainer people argued it at their
firesides numerous letters were sent to nearly every periodical in the
country and public readers were expounding it to their audiences It
interested heathen and Christian alike for an English friend told Mr
Stockton that in India he had heard a group of Hindoo men gravely
debating the problem Of course a mass of letters came pouring in upon
the author
A singular thing about this story has been the revival of interest in it
that has occurred from time to time Although written many years ago it
seems still to excite the interest of a younger generation for after
an interval of silence on the subject of greater or less duration
suddenly without apparent cause numerous letters in relation to it
will appear on the authors table and solutions will be printed in
the newspapers This ebb and flow has continued up to the present time
Mr Stockton made no attempt to answer the question he had raised
We both spent much time in the South at different periods The dramatic
and unconsciously humorous side of the negroes pleased his fancy He
walked and talked with them saw them in their homes at their
meetins and in the fields He has drawn with an affectionate hand
the genial companionable Southern negro as he isor rather as he
wasfor this type is rapidly passing away Soon there will be no more
of these oldtime darkies They would be by the world forgot had they
not been embalmed in literature by Mr Stockton and the best Southern
writers
There is one other notable characteristic that should be referred to in
writing of Mr Stocktons storiesthe machines and appliances he
invented as parts of them They are very numerous and ingenious No
matter how extraordinary might be the work in hand the machine to
accomplish the end was made on strictly scientific principles to
accomplish that exact piece of work It would seem that if he had not
been an inventor of plots he might have been an inventor of instruments
This idea is sustained by the fact that he had been a woodengraver only
a short time when he invented and patented a double graver which cuts
two parallel lines at the same time It is somewhat strange that more
than one of these extraordinary machines has since been exploited by
scientists and explorers without the least suspicion on their part that
the enterprising romancer had thought of them first Notable among these
may be named the idea of going to the north pole under the ice the one
that the center of the earth is an immense crystal Great Stone of
Sardis and the attempt to manufacture a gun similar to the Peace
Compeller in The Great War Syndicate
In all of Mr Stocktons novels there were characters taken from real
persons who perhaps would not recognize themselves in the peculiar
circumstances in which he placed them In the crowd of purely
imaginative beings one could easily recognize certain types modified and
altered In The Casting away of Mrs Leeks and Mrs Aleshine he
introduced two delightful old ladies whom he knew and who were never
surprised at anything that might happen Whatever emergency arose they
took it as a matter of course and prepared to meet it Mr Stockton
amused himself at their expense by writing this story He was not at
first interested in the Dusantes and had no intention of ever saying
anything further about them When there was a demand for knowledge of
the Dusantes Mr Stockton did not heed it He was opposed to writing
sequels But when an author of distinction whose work and friendship he
highly valued wrote to him that if he did not write something about the
Dusantes and what they said when they found the board money in the
ginger jar he would do it himself Mr Stockton set himself to writing
The Dusantes
I have been asked to give some account of the places in which Mr
Stocktons stories and novels were written and their environments Some
of the Southern stories were written in Virginia and now and then a
short story elsewhere as suggested by the locality but the most of his
work was done under his own rooftree He loved his home it had to be a
country home and always had to have a garden In the care of a garden
and in driving he found his two greatest sources of recreation
Illustration CLAYMONT MR STOCKTONS HOME NEAR CHARLES TOWN WEST
VIRGINIA
I have mentioned Nutley which lies in New Jersey near New York His
dwelling there was a pretty little cottage where he had a garden some
chickens and a cow This was his home in his editorial days and here
Rudder Grange was written It was a rented place The next home we
owned It stood at a greater distance from New York at the place called
Convent halfway between Madison and Morristown in New Jersey Here we
lived a number of years after Mr Stockton gave up editorial work and
here the greater number of his tales were written It was a much larger
place than we had at Nutley with more chickens two cows and a much
larger garden
Mr Stockton dictated his stories to a stenographer His favorite spot
for this in summer was a grove of large firtrees near the house Here
in the warm weather he would lie in a hammock His secretary would be
near with her writing materials and a book of her choosing The book
was for her own reading while Mr Stockton was thinking It annoyed
him to know he was being waited for He would think out pages of
incidents and scenes and even whole conversations before he began to
dictate After all had been arranged in his mind he dictated rapidly
but there often were long pauses when the secretary could do a good
deal of reading In cold weather he had the secretary and an easy chair
in the studya room he had built according to his own fancy A fire of
blazing logs added a glow to his fancies
I may state here that we always spent a part of every winter in New
York A certain amount of city life was greatly enjoyed Mr Stockton
thus secured much intellectual pleasure He liked his clubs and was
fond of society where he met men noted in various walks of life1
Footnote 1 Edward Gary the secretary of the Century Club in the
obituary notice of Mr Stockton written by him for the clubs annual
report says of Mr Stockton as a member It was but a dozen years ago
that Frank R Stockton entered the fellowship of the Century in which
he soon became exceedingly at home winning friends here as he won them
all over the land and in other lands by the charm of his keen and
kindly mind shining in all that he wrote and said He had an
extraordinary capacity for work and a rare talent for diversion and the
Century was honored by his wellearned fame and fortunate in its share
in his ever fresh and varying companionship
I am now nearing the close of a life which had had its trials and
disappointments its struggles with weak health and with unsatisfying
labor But these mostly came in the earlier years and were met with
courage an ever freshspringing hope and a buoyant spirit that would
not be intimidated On the whole as one looks back through the long
vista much more of good than of evil fell to his lot His life had been
full of interesting experiences and one of perhaps unusual happiness
At the last there came to pass the fulfilment of a dream in which he had
long indulged He became the possessor of a beautiful estate containing
what he most desired and with surroundings and associations dear to his
heart
He had enjoyed The Holt his New Jersey home and was much interested in
improving it His neighbors and friends there were valued companions
But in his heart there had always been a longing for a home not
suburbana place in the real country and with more land Finally
the time came when he felt that he could gratify this longing He liked
the Virginia climate and decided to look for a place somewhere in that
State not far from the city of Washington After a rather prolonged
search we one day lighted upon Claymont in the Shenandoah Valley It
won our hearts and ended our search It had absolutely everything that
Mr Stockton coveted He bought it at once and we moved into it as
speedily as possible
Claymont is a handsome colonial residence with all modern
improvementsan unusual combination It lies near the historic old
town of Charles Town in West Virginia near Harpers Ferry Claymont is
itself an historic place The land was first owned by the Father of his
Country This great personage designed the house with its main
building two cottages or lodges and courtyards for his nephew
Bushrod to whom he had given the land Through the wooded park runs the
old road now grass grown over which Braddock marched to his celebrated
defeat guided by the youthful George Washington who had surveyed the
whole region for Lord Fairfax During the civil war the place twice
escaped destruction because it had once been the property of Washington
But it was not for its historical associations but for the place
itself that Mr Stockton purchased it From the main road to the house
there is a drive of threequarters of a mile through a park of great
foresttrees and picturesque groups of rocks On the opposite side of
the house extends a wide open lawn and here and from the piazzas a
noble view of the valley and the Blue Ridge Mountains is obtained
Besides the park and other grounds there is a farm at Claymont of
considerable size Mr Stockton however never cared for farming
except in so far as it enabled him to have horses and stock But his
soul delighted in the big old terraced garden of his West Virginia
home Compared with other gardens he had had the new one was like
paradise to the common world At Claymont several short stories were
written John Gaythers Garden was prepared for publication here by
connecting stories previously published into a series told in a garden
and suggested by the one at Claymont John Gayther however was an
invention Kate Bonnet and The Captains TollGate were both written at
Claymont
Illustration A CORNER IN MR STOCKTONS STUDY AT CLAYMONT Showing the
desk at which all his later books were written
Mr Stockton was permitted to enjoy this beautiful place only three
years They were years of such rare pleasure however that we can
rejoice that he had so much joy crowded into so short a space of his
life and that he had it at its close Truly life was never sweeter to
him than at its end and the world was never brighter to him than when
he shut his eyes upon it He was returning from a winter in New York to
his beloved Claymont in good health and full of plans for the summer
and for his garden when he was taken suddenly ill in Washington and
died three days later on April 20 1902 a few weeks after Kate Bonnet
was published in book form
Mr Stockton passed away at a ripe agesixtyeight years And yet his
death was a surprise to us all He had never been in better health
apparently his brain was as active as ever life was dear to him he
seemed much younger than he was He had no wish to give up his work no
thought of old age no mental decay His last novels his last short
stories showed no fallingoff They were the equals of those written in
younger years Nor had he lost the public interest He was always sure
of an audience and his work commanded a higher price at the last than
ever before His was truly a passing away He gently glided from the
homes he had loved to prepare here to one already prepared for him in
heaven unconscious that he was entering one more beautiful than even he
had ever imagined
Mr Stockton was the most lovable of men He shed happiness all around
him not from conscious effort but out of his own bountiful and loving
nature His tender heart sympathized with the sad and unfortunate but
he never allowed sadness to be near if it were possible to prevent it
He hated mourning and gloom They seemed to paralyze him mentally until
his bright spirit had again asserted itself and he had recovered his
balance He usually looked either upon the best or the humorous side of
life Pie won the love of every one who knew himeven that of readers
who did not know him personally as many letters testify To his friends
his loss is irreparable for never again will they find his equal in
such charming qualities of head and heart

This is not the place for a critical estimate of the work of Frank R
Stockton2 His stories are in great part a reflex of himself The
bright outlook on life the courageous spirit the helpfulness the
sense of the comic rather than the tragic the love of domestic life
the sweetness of pure affection live in his books as they lived in
himself He had not the heart to make his stories end unhappily He knew
that there is much of the tragic in human lives but he chose to ignore
it as far as possible and to walk in the pleasant ways which are
numerous in this tangled world There is much philosophy underlying a
good deal that he wrote but it has to be looked for it is not
insistent and is never morbid He could not write an impure word or
express an impure thought for he belonged to the pure in heart who
we are assured shall see God
Footnote 2 I may however properly quote from the sketch prepared by
Mr Gary for the Century Club He brought to his later work the
discipline of long and rather tedious labor with the capital amassed by
acute observation on which his original imagination wrought the
sparkling miracles that we know He has been called the representative
American humorist He was that in the sense that the characters he
created had much of the audacity of the American spirit the thirst for
adventures in untried fields of thought and action the subconscious
seriousness in the most incongruous situations the feeling of being at
home no matter what happens But how amazingly he mingled a broad
philosophy with his fun a philosophy not less wise and comprehending
than his fun was compelling If his humor was American it was also
cosmopolitan and had its laughing way not merely with our British
kinsmen but with alien peoples across the usually impenetrable barrier
of translation The fortune of his jesting lay not in his ears but in
the hearts of his hearers It was at once appealing and revealing It
flashed its playful light into the nooks and corners of our own being
and wove close bonds with those at whom we laughed There was no
bitterness in it He was neither satirist nor preacher nor of set
purpose a teacher though it must be a dull reader that does not gather
from his books the lesson of the value of a gentle heart and a clear
level outlook upon our perplexing world

THE CAPTAINS TOLLGATE
CHAPTER I
Olive
A long wide and smoothly macadamized road stretched itself from the
considerable town of Glenford onward and northward toward a gap in the
distant mountains It did not run through a level country but rose and
fell as if it had been a line of seaweed upon the long swells of the
ocean Upon elevated points upon this road farm lands and forests could
be seen extending in every direction But there was nothing in the
landscape which impressed itself more obtrusively upon the attention of
the traveler than the road itself White in the bright sunlight and gray
under the shadows of the clouds it was the one thing to be seen which
seemed to have a decided purpose Northward or southward toward the gap
in the long line of mountains or toward the woodencircled town in the
valley it was always going somewhere
About two miles from the town and at the top of the first long hill
which was climbed by the road a tall white pole projected upward
against the sky sometimes perpendicularly and sometimes inclined at a
slight angle This was a turnpike gate or bar and gave notice to all in
vehicles or on horses that the use of this wellkept road was not free
to the traveling public At the approach of persons not known or too
well known the bar would slowly descend across the road as if it were
a musket held horizontally while a sentinel demanded the password
Upon the side of the road opposite to the great post on which the
tollgate moved was a little house with a covered doorway from which
toll could be collected without exposing the collector to sun or rain
This tollhouse was not a plain whitewashed shed such as is often seen
upon turnpike roads but a neat edifice containing a comfortable room
