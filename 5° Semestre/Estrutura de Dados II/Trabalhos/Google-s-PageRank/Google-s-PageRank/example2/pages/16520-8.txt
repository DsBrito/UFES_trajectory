THE RIGHTS OF A GIRL
She has certain inalienable rights regardless of race color or social
state When it has thought about her at all society in general has
supposed until recently that in a free country a glorious land of
opportunity the girl has her rightsthe right to work the right to
play the right to secure an education and to enter the professions the
right to marry or to refuse the right in short to do as she shall
choose And in a sense and to the casual observer this is true Our
country gives to her some rights which she can enjoy nowhere else in the
world But as one learns to know her little by little the stupendous
fact is impressed upon him that girlhood has been and is being denied
its rights
It is the right of every girl to be born into a community where the
sanitary conditions are such that she has at least a fair chance to
enter upon life without being physically handicapped at the start But
hundreds of girls every year open their baby eyes in dark inner rooms
where the dim gas light steals what oxygen there may chance to be in the
heavy air take their first steps in foul alleys find their first toys
in garbage cans and gutters They have been denied their rights at the
start In a Christian land they grow weak anemic yield to the white
specter and in a few years pass out of the unfair world to which they
came or remain to fight out a miserable existence against terrific
odds They make up an army of girls who have been denied their rights
And her religion What is it that religion may offer to her in
compensation for that which she has been denied
It is the right of every girl to be born under conditions which will
make possible sufficient food and clothing for her natural growth and
development But scores of little girls go shivering to school every
morning after a breakfast of bread and tea they return numb with cold
after a dinner of more bread and tea and they go home to a supper of the
same with a piece of stale cake or a cookie to help out Nature calls
aloud for nourishment and there is no answer The girl enters her
teens finds a job goes to work hungry the long year through
fighting to win out over the cold in winter and to endure the scorching
days of summer And her religion What is it that religion may offer to
her in compensation for what she has been denied
It is the right of every girl to receive through the educational work
of the community training which shall fit her for clean honest and
efficient living Yet every year sees hundreds of girls turned out into
the world wholly unequipped for life their special talents
undiscovered their energies undirected their purposes unformed their
ambitions unawakened
It is the right of every girl to be shielded from the moral danger and
physical strain of labor for her daily bread at least until she shall
reach the age of sixteen Yet every year sees a long procession of girls
from eight to sixteen entering into the economic struggle who cannot
claim their rights
It is the right of every girl to have a good time to play under
conditions that are morally safe and to enjoy amusements that leave no
stain Hundreds of girls live in communities where this is absolutely
impossible What has religion to offer to a girl denied an education
which will fit her for the life she must live compelled to enter into a
fierce struggle for daily bread while still a child surrounded by every
sort of cheap exotic amusement behind which temptation lurks Has it
anything to offer in compensation if it permits conditions to go on
unchanged
It is the right of every girl to enjoy companionship and friends
Thousands of girls toil through the day in shops factories offices and
kitchens and at night sit friendless and alone until the loneliness
becomes unendurable and they seek companionship of the unfit and the
refuge of the street Has religion anything to do with lonely girlhood
It is the right of every girl to receive such instruction regarding
her own physical life and development as shall serve to protect her from
the pitfalls laid for the thoughtless and ignorant and shall fit her to
understand and when the time comes accept the privileges and
responsibilities of motherhood Every year sees thousands of girls enter
the teens whose only knowledge of self and motherhood is gained through
the half truths revealed by companions the suggestions of patent
medicine and kindred advertisements or the falsehoods of those who seek
to corrupt What has a girls religion to do with these simple
undeniable facts
It is the right of every girl to receive the protection of wise
parental authority The guidance of parents who earnestly wisely and
with the highest motives require obedience from those too young to
choose for themselves is the right of every girl Yet thousands of girls
every year are left to decide lifes most important questions while
parents weak indifferent or careless sleep until it is too late Has
religion anything to offer to girls whose parents have laid down their
task and neglected their duty
It is the right of every girl to receive such moral and religious
instruction as shall develop and strengthen her higher nature fortify
her against temptation and lead her in the spirit of the Author of the
Golden Rule into service for her fellows Yet thousands of girls are
without definite moral and religious instruction and unconscious of the
fact that it is their right and thousands more receive moral and
religious training in haphazard fashion and from sources inadequate to
the task
When the community awakens to the necessity for sanitary conditions in
the environment of every girl and honestly seeks the solution of the
problems of economic injustice when the educational system seeks to
prepare its girls for the life they must live when laws for the
regulation of labor for girls are made in the interest of the girl
herself when the community makes it possible for its girls to play in
safety and makes provision for friendless and lonely girlhood when
mothers instruct their daughters in the most important facts of life
parents exercise protective authority and the church provides adequate
assistance in the task of moral and religious instruction then and not
till then will the girl receive her rights
And the girls religion The girl is naturally religious Without
religion no girl comes into her own Whenever and wherever religion
concerns itself with the rights of a girl it becomes a girls religion
to which she can pledge body mind and soul For the coming of that
religion the world of girlhood eagerly waits

THE HANDICAPPED GIRL
They were both handicapped as a careful observer could tell at a
glance One stood behind the counter the other in front of it examining
the toys she was about to purchase for a Christmas box for some young
cousins in the country She had not been able to find just what she
wanted and was impatient in voice and manner as she explained to the
girl on the other side of the counter what she had hoped to find She
was extravagantly gowned in a fashion not at all in good taste for
morning shopping but she was pretty and her fair complexion her
shining hair soft and well cared for the beautiful fur thrown back
over her shoulders fascinated the other girl and filled her heart with
envy She was pale and anemic her hair was dark and there was barely
enough of it to do up even when helped out by the puffs she had bought
from the counter on the opposite side The weather had been bitterly
cold and she was suffering from sore throat and headache She had turned
up the collar of her thin coat but it had failed to protect her and she
was thinking of that as she looked at the fur She was worn out by the
strain of the Christmas season had slept late and then rushed to the
store with only a cup of coffee to help her do the work of the morning
She did not care much whether the girl before her found the toys she
wanted or not Toys seemed such a small part of life and Christmas
aroused in her all sorts of conflicting emotions It was winter and life
looked very hard as it can look to a girl of fourteen upon whom poverty
had laid a heavy hand and whose life has been robbed by the sins and
misfortunes of others who has been handicapped from the beginning
The girl before the counter finally decided upon the toys ordered them
sent to her home and looking scornfully at the cheap jewelry and tawdry
ornaments passed out of the store She was thinking what a nuisance
cousins were how ridiculous it was in her father to insist each year
upon her remembering his poor relations at Christmas just when she
needed all her allowance for herself and planning to tell him that next
year she did not intend to do it She was in a most unhappy mood because
she had been denied permission to attend a houseparty and she could not
bear to be denied anything She was handicapped by the heavy hand of
money newly acquired by her father and by the atmosphere of pride
vanity and social ambition which surrounded her
All day through the busy streets of the shopping district they
passedthe citys handicapped girls Some were held back from the best
that life can give by poverty which like a great yawning chasm lies
between the girl and all her natural desires and ambitions some held
back from the joy of simple natural living by the forced artificial
social system of which they are a part some pitiful specimens of
physical and mental handicap and some who showed the strain of the
handicap of sin mingled in that Christmas crowd
Through the open door of great seaport cities there have poured during
the years past steady streams of handicapped girls They are poor they
are plunged into a life whose manners and customs they cannot grasp
they are handicapped by a language they do not understand and by great
expectations seldom destined to be fulfilled
According to our government statistics during nineteen hundred twelve
ninety three thousand two hundred sixtyone 93261 girls from fifteen
to twentyone years of age came to us from across the sea and in three
years an army of two hundred fortysix thousand five hundred fiftyfour
246554 became a part of the girl problem our country must meet It is
hard to picture in concrete fashion how great this host of girlhood is
Sometimes when one looks into the faces of a thousand college girls at
Wellesley Vassar or Smith and realizes that in a single year more than
ninety three times as many girls from fifteen to twentyone came to test
the opportunities of a new land the significance of the figure becomes
a little more clear to him When he realizes that in three years enough
young girls land in this country to found a city the size of Rochester
or St Paul when he tries to imagine this army of girls marching six
abreast through city streets for hours and hours until the thousands
upon thousands representing scores of tongues and nations have passed
some conception of the great task facing any organization attempting to
direct that army of unprepared unequipped and largely unprotected
girlhood comes to him
Illustration UNCONSCIOUS OF HER HANDICAPS SHE ANTICIPATES KEENLY LIFE
IN THE NEW WORLD
Where will they be in another yearthose ninetythree thousand and more
who came to us in nineteen hundred twelve What an array of factories
and kitchens what rows of dingy tenements the moving picture film
could reveal to us if it followed these handicapped girls It does not
follow themthey come in over the blue waters of the bay look with
shining eyes at Liberty with her promise of fulfilment of all the
hearts desires they sit in the long rows of benches at Ellis Island
pass through the gate and are gone the majority to be lost in the mass
that struggles for a mere livelihoodjust the chance to keep on living
What if some summer morning or in the dim twilight of a bitter winter
day a miracle should be wrought and the handicapped should be lifted so
that girlhood might be free to work out the realization of its dreams
Many have prayed for such a miracle some have hoped for itbut it
will not come There will be no miracle suddenly wrought for men to gaze
upon in wonder and after a time forget The release of the handicapped
can come only through mans Godinspired effort on behalf of his brother
man In removing his brothers handicap he will remove his own and both
shall be free to live But it cannot be done in a moment Effort is
slow It cannot be done by any organization or church or creed or
individual It must be done by the public conscience Educating the
public conscience is a long process and America is in the midst of that
process now There are two qualifications without which the educator of
the public conscience cannot succeedone is patience the other
persistence All educators of the public sense of right like Jane
Addams have had these two characteristics in marked degree and all
churches creeds and organizations which have had local success in
removing local handicaps have shown the ability to wait and the power to
persevere despite every opposition
How the public conscience will act in directing the work of removing the
conditions which so sadly handicap girlhood today we cannot say It may
be that vocational schools built and maintained by the State not by
charity will be one strong hand laid upon the inefficiency and
ignorance that handicap It may be that the Welfare teacher whose salary
and rank shall equal that of the teacher of Greek Ancient History or
arithmetic will be another hand laid upon the shoulder of the girl
limited by the lack of friendship and protection It may be that houses
maintained as a business proposition and paying honest returns built in
such a way that girls obliged to work away from home may be decently
housed and have a fair chance for health will be another strong hand
reached out to release her from the things that handicap It may be that
a minimum wage safety devices laws wiping out sweatshop methods will
reduce the number of handicapped girls
Wise cities may establish special schools for the immigrant girl where
she shall learn something of the language while being taught the making
of beds simple cooking and the common kitchen tasks then to be
recommended with some equipment to the homes greatly in need of her
Even if she should choose later to go into shop or store the State will
have gone a long way toward removing the great handicap by having taught
her to understand the language of the new land to care for a room cook
simple food and keep clean
It may be that some thoughtful States will require school attendance
until a girl is sixteen the age under which no girl should enter the
business world as a wage earner
It may be that the natural good sense of the true American woman will
finally triumph over the extravagant and unnatural living of the present
day and that the handicap of false standards superficiality display
idleness and wild pursuit of exotic pleasures shall be lifted from the
girls now held prisoners by the tyranny of money and complex social
life
It may be that in all these ways and scores of others the public
conscience working out along lines in which it finds itself best fitted
and most interested to work will solve the problem of the handicapped
girl
Before one can possibly help another in a permanent way he must know
what is the trouble with him and then what has caused the trouble
The greatest encouragement in our girl problem today lies in the fact
that politics is looking at her and asking questions it scarcely dares
to answer the corporation is looking at her compelled to do so often
against its will City Government School Board Board of Health are all
looking at her womens clubs whose individual members have never given
her a thought are reaching out a hand to her the Church whose part we
shall study definitely later on is looking more practically and
sensibly and with deeper interest than ever before the Young Womens
Christian Associations are looking wisely and intelligently getting
facts which speak with tremendous power and showing them to the world
More than all this the handicapped girl is looking at herself
It has become in these days the passionate desire of those who see the
problem with both heart and mind and are interested not in abstract
girlhood but in the individual living real girl that the public
conscience be more deeply touched and stirred until it shall feel that
by whatever means the thing is to be accomplished the bounden duty of
Church and State to give themselves to the task of solving the problem
is clear
For in the midst of every problempolitical social economic
religious there stands The Handicapped Girl God help herand
usfor until we have gained the wisdom to remove her handicap the whole
problem will remain unsolved We are learningevery year shows a gain
and in this fact lies our hope
III
THE PRIVILEGED GIRL
One finds her in all sorts of unexpected places Last summer I saw her
in a home of wealth and luxury She was fifteen the eldest of a family
of four children Behind her was a long line of ancestry of which anyone
might rightfully be proud Her face was pure and sweet and her eyes
revealed the frankness and honest purpose of past generations After
breakfast she played for the hymns at prayers and in a clear true
soprano led the singing A twelveyearold brother had selected the part
of the Bible to be read and the eightyearold sister had chosen the
hymns The fathers prayer was simple and sincere and some of its
sentences were remembered for many a day After prayers the girl
attended to the flowers This was her work for the summer I saw her
gather from their lovely garden dainty blossoms and sprays of green
making them with unusual skill into bouquets for the Flower Mission in
the city Then three small baskets were filled with pansies These went
to three old ladies in the factory section of the village She told me
they were the sweetest old ladies and dear friends of hers She
seemed to take real delight in making the baskets beautiful I saw her
later in the day galloping off through the woods on her horse her face
glowing with health and happiness In the afternoon she spent an hour on
German which she said was her hopeless study but I found her reading
German folk lore with ease She was familiar with the best things in
literature was intensely interested in art and revealed unusual
knowledge without any evidence of precociousness She was just a normal
healthy natural girl wellborn wellbred a girl with every
advantage When I said goodnight to her in her lovely room and thought
of her protected sheltered life I wondered how she might be helped to
know into what pleasant places her lot had fallen and how she might come
to understand and do in later years her full duty toward the other
fifteenyearold girl who that day made paper boxes feathers flowers
or shirtwaists toiled in the laundries or the cotton factory or walked
with heavy heart from place to place searching for work They are
dependent upon one another these two They do not know it now but if
each is to be her best they must know
How to lead her daughter to value and help this other girl that sweet
mother told me as we talked in the library that night she felt was her
great problem We women are responsible for so much she said and
our daughters will be responsible for still more We must help them
estimate things at their right value With that thought and spirit in
her mothers heart the girl I had watched all day with such pleasure
seemed doubly privileged
Last September I saw another privileged girl She showed me her trunk
packed for college Every member of the family was interested in it
perhaps most of all her father who had put into the bank that first
dollar on the day that she was born with the faith that what should be
added to it might one day mean college Behind her was a long line of
honest ancestry simple people who had worked hard and managed to get
along She was the first on either side of the family to go to
college No one in the family even the most distant relative failed
to feel the importance of the event Toms Dorothy goes to college this
weekthink of it a great aunt in a little unpainted lowroofed
farmhouse far away in the hills told all her friends at church
Great ambition hopes and dreams were packed into that trunk and the day
when she should graduate and come back to teach in the high school
seemed near Jack and Bessie and Newton were in her plans for using the
money she should earn when those four short years were over
Illustration SHE WAS FULL OF AMBITION AND WILLING TO WORK
Looking at her sweet fresh face so full of happiness one knew her to be
a privileged girl All through high school she had had her purpose
clear her studies were a pleasure her simple good times were enjoyed
to the full and life every moment of it was worth the living When I
saw her lock the trunk and excitedly instruct the expressman as to just
how it must be carried I had a sudden vision of the thousands of girls
with happy faces filled with anticipation of all that is wrapped up in
that one word college A great army of privileged girls they are
One cannot help wishing that he might feel sure that when they leave
those college halls it might be with a deep appreciation and real
sympathetic understanding of the other girls who have turned their eyes
with longing toward four years more of study and fun but whose feet
were obliged to walk in other pathways They are so dependent upon one
another these girls who can go to college and the other girls who
cannot go They do not know it now but neither girl can ever come to her
best until the privileged girl sees and understands
One of the most interesting of the privileged girls I met one morning
going to work It was her third month in the office One of the finest
in the city Theres a chance to work up and me for the top she told
me her face beaming Her father had come across the sea from Sweden
when a boy Long generations of honest folk were behind him and he made
good in the new land He saved a good share of the wages he made in the
bicycle shop studied with a correspondence school and assumed more and
more responsible positions with higher wages At last he was able to
build a house for his young family at the end of the car line where the
children had room to play and the cow and chickens kept the boys busy
and taught them to work Olga was the eldest and it was a proud night
for the family when she graduated from grammar school Going home on the
trolley her father determined that she should have the desire of her
heart and go for two years to business college There was great
rejoicing on the part of the family when he made his decision known and
Olga hardly slept that night When the two years were over the principal
of the school had said such fine things of her work that Olga had
blushed to hear them More than that he offered her the best position
open to his students He was a little astonished the next morning when
Olgas father came down to ask in his careful English regarding the
character of the men in the office where his daughter was to work To
Olgas great joy he was able to satisfy the father to whom the matter
was of enough importance to make him put on his best clothes and take
half a day off in order to make sure that all was right
It was a great day when Olga came home with her yellow envelope and laid
the money on the table Not a cent would her father take No Olga he
said the money is yours You shall keep the account of it and show it
to your father You shall buy the new bed for your room and the chairs
Your mother wants the house made pretty Perhaps you will help That
will be very good But the money is yours No one seeing the girls
face as she related her fathers words could doubt the appreciation in
her heart Her girl friends had paid their board and she had expected
to do the same That night she refurnished the house in her dreams and
the memory of that dream room of her mothers with paper on the wall
and rugs on the floor helped her save her money until the dream came
true
Olga is indeed a privileged girl She has parents wise enough to have
given her the best equipment possible for the work she wanted to do She
has her own money and may dress as well as any girl in the office She
has an object for saving what she can and knows the joy of helping to
make home beautiful The suburban church is the center of many of her
pleasures for it is alive and the young people in it know how to enjoy
themselves She is loved and sheltered in a real home She can live a
normal useful happy life with opportunity for promotion in her work
and an object for her ambition She has health sane pleasures and good
friends Any such girl is indeed privileged
When one sees her going happily to work he is forced to think of the
other girl her homeless boarding place chance friends pitiful
economies and few pleasures the girl who has forgotten what it means to
be sheltered and protected if she ever knew to whom love is a myth or
a dream
Perhaps one of the happiest of the privileged girls was the one who took
me to her room on a beautiful June day to show me her cedar chest her
gowns and the gifts already beginning to come The day was near The
young man whom she was to marry was honest and fine in business with
his father and hoping to make the firm a greater success than ever as
the years should pass The girl was just twentyone After high school
a mother who was not strong needed her help and she had made that home a
center of enjoyment for three years Surrounded by the loving
appreciation of parents and brothers her life was filled with
happiness Now in a few days she would go across the street to the house
built for her and furnished simply and well with the articles which he
and she had chosen on the long shopping tours during the months past
She was in every sense a privileged girl
The other girl saw her married She was looking forward to her own
wedding day but it seemed farther away than ever She had no hope for a
house built for her but she knew where there was a flat for rental
which she had mentally furnished many times that month But they could
not afford it They had added and subtracted and gone over the figures
again and again but it was of no use He was manly and fine he had hope
and ambition but the clerkship was only fifteen dollars a week and he
had tried in vain for another position Fifteen dollars a week would not
do in their city Butter eggs coal ice milk and meat stood in the
way So they were waiting and there were tears in her eyes at the
wedding of the privileged girl
That day was a hard one for another girl She read of the weddingthe
decorations the gifts the congratulations of friendsthen putting
down the paper forced back the tears and went out to finish the shirt
waist she was making for it must be ready to wear to the office in the
morning That evening he would come she knew to tell her again that it
was not fair that her family would get along some way and that he had
been patient for a long time She knew that he must continue to wait
for her mother was doing her utmost Wilbur could earn only a little and
the other two children were too young to leave school It was three
years since her fathers death The young man had said then that he
could wait ten years She had begged him to take his release but he
refused Of late he had been very insistent She knew she must stand by
her mother and help her through If he could not see it that way there
was but one thing to do She found it hard even to think the words that
she must say and she thought of the privileged girl with longing in her
soul But the privileged girl did not know If she had her sympathy and
understanding would have helped
One rejoices as he remembers the thousands of pure sweet wholesome
girls who have been privileged to enjoy the results of a long ancestry
unstained by weakness and sin the results of training guidance and
protection the opportunity for healthful normal living for pleasures
and the satisfaction of human friendship and love Our country looks
today with increasing hopefulness to these privileged girls for the
solution of many of the problems of the other girl Our country looks to
them for another generation of privileged girls even stronger and wiser
than they
One of the greatest of the problems with which our country is concerned
today the solution of which involves every phase of social religious
and economic life is the providing of ways and means by which the
unprivileged girl may in large numbers be promoted into the privileged
class
IV
THE GIRL WHO IS EASILY LED
She is a chameleon sort of girl but she is not rare So often she is
sweet and lovable Almost without exception she is obliging a jolly
companion fearless and frank One often finds her a girl of talent and
natural ability She is the very opposite of the indifferent girl for
she responds to everything The girl she will finally become depends
upon the companions whose lead she follows Her safety lies in the
establishment of the habit of going in the right way She is the girl
who most needs care and guardianship So much depends upon her choice of
friends that parents and teachers must be wise for her
A little tenyearold in whom all her teachers were interested because
of her versatility and quick response to every interest moved into a
new neighborhood Some weeks later because of her ability to learn
rapidly she was put into a higher grade Her new home and new
classmates in a short time entirely changed the character of her
environment Before long the girl herself began to show the result of
the change She had always been too much interested in her studies to
waste time or disobey the school rules Following the leadership of some
of the newly made friends she entered into all the little conspiracies
of a group of girls and boys who made things hard for the teacher a
rather weak disciplinarian One day the girl hitherto perfectly honest
told a lie to get out of the trouble into which the following of the new
leaders had brought her It troubled her conscience and she cried on the
way home from school but her companions laughed at her told her she
was all right and had stood by them splendidly They made her feel
heroic and she dried her eyes and stifled her desire to tell her mother
Before the year was over the child had entirely changed Her studies
suffered she seemed to lose her ambition her naturalness and
spontaneity vanished Her mother began to discover increasing
untruthfulness One day toward the close of the school year the child
asked to wear her best dress to school saying there was to be an
entertainment There was no entertainment Instead there was a party at
the home of one of the girls of whom her mother disapproved The party
began later than they had planned and it was nearly six before the child
reached home She found her mother greatly troubled and said quite
glibly that she had stayed after school to help the teacher Next day
the mother called at the school to remonstrate with the teacher for
keeping the child so often and so late to help her Then the whole
truth came out and the mother was dismayed She felt that the matter was
so serious that she must remove her daughter at once from her companions
and before school opened in the fall the family had moved back to their
former neighborhood and the parents were permitted to send the little
