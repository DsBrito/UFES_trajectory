Illustration THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN BOSTON
Before the white people came there were no houses in this country but
the little huts of the Indians The Indian houses were made of
bark or mats or skins spread over poles
Some people came to one part of the country Others started
settlements in other places When more people came some of these
settlements grew into towns The woods were cut down Farms were
planted Roads were made But it took many years for the country to
fill with people
The first white people that came to live in the woods where Boston is
now settled there a long time ago They had a governor over them
He was a good man and did much for the people His name was John
Winthrop
The first thing the people had to do was to cut down the trees After
that they could plant corn But at first they could not raise
anything to eat They had brought flour and oatmeal from England
But they found that it was not enough to last till they could raise
corn on their new ground
Winthrop sent a ship to get more food for them The ship was gone a
long time The people ate up all their food They were hungry They
went to the seashore and found clams and mussels They were glad to
get these to eat
At last they set a day for everybody to fast and pray for food The
governor had a little flour left Nearly all of this was made into
bread and put into the oven to bake He did not know when he would
get any more
Soon after this a poor man came along His flour was all gone His
bread had all been eaten up His family were hungry The governor
gave the poor man the very last flour that he had in the barrel
Just then a ship was seen It sailed up toward Boston It was loaded
with food for all the people
The time for the fast day came But there was now plenty of food The
fast day was turned into a thanksgiving day
One day a man sent a very cross letter to Governor Winthrop
Winthrop sent it back to him He said I cannot keep a letter that
might make me angry Then the man that had written the cross letter
wrote to Winthrop By conquering yourself you have
conquered me
MARQUETTE IN IOWA
The first white men to go into the middle of our country were
Frenchmen The French had settled in Canada They sent
missionaries to preach to the Indians in the West They also sent
traders to buy furs from the Indians
The Frenchmen heard the Indians talk about a great river in the West
But no Frenchman had ever gone far enough to see the Mississippi
Marquette was a priest Joliet was a trader These two men were
sent to find the great river that the Indians talked about
They traveled in two birch canoes They took five men to paddle the
canoes They took some smoked meat to eat on the way They also took
some Indian corn They had trinkets to trade to the Indians
Hatchets and beads and bits of cloth were the money they used to pay
the Indians for what they wanted
The friendly Indians in Wisconsin tried to persuade them not to go
They told them that the Indians on the great river would kill them
The friendly Indians also told them that there was a demon in one part
of the river They said that this demon roared so loud that he could
be heard a long way off They said that the demon would draw the
travelers down into the water Then they told about great monsters
that ate up men and their canoes
But Marquette and the men with him thought they would risk the
journey They would not turn back for fear of the demon or
the monsters
The two little canoes went down the Wisconsin River After some days
they came to the Mississippi More than a hundred years before the
Spaniards had seen the lower part of this river But no white man had
ever seen this part of the great river Marquette did not know that
any white man had ever seen any part of the Mississippi
The two little canoes now turned their bows down the river Sometimes
they saw great herds of buffaloes Some of these came to the bank of
the river to look at the men in the canoes They had long shaggy
manes which hung down over their eyes
For two weeks the travelers paddled down the river In all this time
they did not see any Indians After they had gone hundreds of miles in
this way they came to a place where they saw tracks in the mud It
was in what is now the State of Iowa
Marquette and Joliet left the men in their canoes and followed the
tracks After walking two hours they came to an Indian village The
Frenchmen came near enough to hear the Indians talking The Indians
did not see them
Joliet and Marquette did not know whether the Indians would kill
them or not They said a short prayer Then they stood out in full
view and gave a loud shout
The Indians came out of their tents like bees They stared at the
strangers Then four Indians came toward them These Indians carried a
peace pipe They held this up toward the sun This meant that they
were friendly
The Indians now offered the peace pipe to the Frenchmen The
Frenchmen took it and smoked with the Indians This was the Indian
way of saying We are friends
Illustration Marquette and Joliet
Marquette asked the Indians what tribe they belonged to
They told him that they were of the tribe called the Illinois
They took Joliet and Marquette into their village They came to the
door of a large wigwam A chief stood in the door He shaded his eyes
with both hands as if the sun were shining in his face Then he made
a little speech
He said Frenchmen how bright the sun shines when you come to see
us We are all waiting for you You shall now come into our houses
in peace
The Illinois Indians made a feast for their new friends First they
had mush of corn meal with fat meat in it One of the Indians fed the
Frenchmen as though they were babies He put mush into their mouths
with a large spoon
Then came some fish The Indian that fed the visitors picked out the
bones with his fingers Then he put the pieces of fish into their
mouths After they had some roasted dog The Frenchmen did not like
this Last they were fed with buffalo meat
The next morning six hundred Indians went to the canoes to tell the
Frenchmen goodby They gave Marquette a young Indian slave And they
gave him a peace pipe to carry with him
INDIAN PICTURES
When Marquette and his men left the Illinois they went on down the
river The friendly Illinois had told them that the Indians they
would see were bad and that they would kill any one who came into
their country
The Frenchmen had heard before this that there were demons and
monsters in the river One day they saw some high rocks with pictures
painted on them The ugly pictures made them think of these monsters
They were painted in red black and green colors They were pictures
of two Indian demons or gods
Each one of these monsters was about the size of a calf They had
horns as long as those of a deer Their eyes were red Their faces
were like a mans but they were ugly and frightful They had beards
like a tigers Their bodies were covered with scales like those on a
fish Their long tails were wound round their bodies and over their
heads and down between their legs The end of each tail was like that
of a fish
The Indians prayed to these ugly gods when they passed in their
canoes Even Marquette and his men were a little frightened when they
saw such pictures in a place so lonely The Frenchmen went down the
river about twelve hundred miles Sometimes the Indians tried to kill
them but by showing the peace pipe they made friends At last they
turned back Joliet went to Canada Marquette preached to the
Indians in the West till he died
WILLIAM PENN AND THE INDIANS
The King of England gave all the land in Pennsylvania to William
Penn The King made Penn a kind of king over Pennsylvania Penn
could make the laws of this new country But he let the people make
their own laws
Penn wanted to be friendly with the Indians He paid them for all the
land his people wanted to live on Before he went to Pennsylvania
he wrote a letter to the Indians He told them in this letter that he
would not let any of his people do any harm to the Indians He said he
would punish anybody that did any wrong to an Indian This letter was
read to the Indians in their own language
Soon after this Penn got into a ship and sailed from England He
sailed to Pennsylvania When he came there he sent word to the
tribes of Indians to come to meet him
The Indians met under a great elm tree on the bank of the river
Indians like to hold their solemn meetings out of doors They sit on
the ground They say that the earth is the Indians mother
When Penn came to the place of meeting he found the woods full of
Indians As far as he could see there were crowds of Indians Penns
friends were few They had no guns
Penn had a bright blue sash round his waist One of the Indian chiefs
who was the great chief put on a kind of cap or crown In the middle
of this was a small horn The head chief wore this only at such great
meetings as this one
When the great chief had put on his horn all the other chiefs and
great men of the Indians put down their guns Then they sat down in
front of Penn in the form of a halfmoon Then the great chief told
Penn that the Indians were ready to hear what he had to say
Penn had a large paper in which he had written all the things that he
and his friends had promised to the Indians He had written all the
promises that the Indians were to make to the white people This was
to make them friends When Penn had read this to them it was
explained to them in their own language Penn told them that they
might stay in the country that they had sold to the white people The
land would belong to both the Indians and the white people
Then Penn laid the large paper down on the ground That was to show
them he said that the ground was to belong to the Indians and the
white people together
He said that there might be quarrels between some of the white people
and some of the Indians But they would settle any quarrels without
fighting Whenever there should be a quarrel the Indians were to
pick out six Indians The white people should also pick out six of
their men These were to meet and settle the quarrel
Penn said I will not call you my children because fathers
sometimes whip their children I will not call you brothers because
brothers sometimes fall out But I will call you the same person as
the white people We are the two parts of the same body
The Indians could not write But they had their way of putting down
things that they wished to have remembered They gave Penn a belt of
shell beads These beads are called wampum Some wampum is white
Some is purple
They made this belt for Penn of white beads In the middle of the belt
they made a picture of purple beads It is a picture of a white man
and an Indian They have hold of each others hands When they gave
this belt to Penn they said We will live with William Penn and his
children as long as the sun and moon shall last
Illustration Penn jumping with the Indians
Penn took up the great paper from the ground He handed it to the
great chief that wore the horn on his head He told the Indians to
keep it and hand it to their childrens children that they might know
what he had said Then he gave them many presents of such things as
they liked They gave Penn a name in their own language They named
him Onas That was their word for a feather As the white people
used a pen made out of a quill or feather they called a pen onas
That is why they called William Penn Brother Onas
Penn sometimes went to see the Indians He talked to them and gave
them friendly advice Once he saw some of them jumping They were
trying to see who could jump the farthest
Penn had been a very active boy He knew how to jump very well He
went to the place where the Indians were jumping He jumped farther
than any of them
When the great governor took part in their sport the Indians were
pleased They loved Brother Onas more than ever
ONE LITTLE BAG OF RICE
The first white people that came to this country hardly knew how to
get their living here They did not know what would grow best in
this country
Many of the white people learned to hunt All the land was covered
with trees In the woods were many animals whose flesh was good to
eat There were deer and bears and great shaggy buffaloes There
were rabbits and squirrels And there were many kinds of birds The
hunters shot wild ducks wild turkeys wild geese and pigeons The
people also caught many fishes out of the rivers
Then there were animals with fur on their backs The people killed
these and sold their skins In this way many made their living
Other people spent their time in cutting down the trees They sawed
the trees into timbers and boards Some of it they split into staves
to make barrels They sent the staves and other sorts of timber to
other countries to be sold In South Carolina men made tar and
pitch out of the pine trees
But there was a wise man in South Carolina He was one of those men
that find out better ways of doing His name was Thomas Smith
Thomas Smith had once lived in a large island thousands of miles away
from South Carolina In that island he had seen the people raising
rice He saw that it was planted in wet ground He said that he would
like to try it in South Carolina But he could not get any seed
rice to plant The rice that people eat is not fit to sow
One day a ship came to Charleston where Thomas Smith lived It had
been driven there by storms The ship came from the large island
where Smith had seen rice grow The captain of this ship was an old
friend of Smith
The two old friends met once more Thomas Smith told the captain that
he wanted some rice for seed The captain called the cook of his ship
and asked him if he had any The cook had one little bag of seed rice
The captain gave this to his friend
There was some wet ground at the back of Smiths garden In this wet
ground he sowed some of the rice It grew finely
He gathered a good deal of rice in his garden that year He gave part
of this to his friends They all sowed it The next year there was a
great deal of rice
After a while the wet land in South Carolina was turned to rice
fields Every year many thousands of barrels of rice were sent away
to be sold
All this came from one little bag of rice and one wise man
Illustration Rice Plant
THE STORY OF A WISE WOMAN
You have read how Thomas Smith first raised rice in Carolina After
his death there lived in South Carolina a wise young woman She
showed the people how to raise another plant Her name was
Eliza Lucas
The father of Miss Lucas did not live in Carolina He was
governor of one of the islands of the West Indies Miss Lucas was
fond of trying new things She often got seeds from her father These
she planted in South Carolina
Her father sent her some seeds of the indigo plant She sowed some
of these in March But there came a frost The indigo plant cannot
stand frost Her plants all died
But Miss Lucas did not give up She sowed some more seeds in April
These grew very well until a cutworm found them The worm wished to
try new things too So he ate off the indigo plants
But Miss Lucas was one of the people who try try again She had lost
her indigo plants twice Once more she sowed some of the seed This
time the plants grew very well
Miss Lucas wrote to her father about it He sent her a man who knew
how to get the indigo out of the plant
The man tried not to show Miss Lucas how to make the indigo He did
not wish the people in South Carolina to learn how to make it He was
afraid his own people would not get so much for their indigo
So he would not explain just how it ought to be done He spoiled the
indigo on purpose
But Miss Lucas watched him closely She found out how the indigo ought
to be made Some of her fathers land in South Carolina was now
planted with the indigo plants
Illustration Indigo Plant
Then Miss Lucas was married She became Mrs Pinckney Her father
gave her all the indigo growing on his land in South Carolina It was
all saved for seed Some of the seed Mrs Pinckney gave to her
friends Some of it her husband sowed It all grew and was made into
that blue dye that we call indigo When it is used in washing clothes
it is called bluing
In a few years more than a million pounds of indigo were made in
South Carolina every year Many people got rich by it And it was all
because Miss Lucas did not give up
FRANKLIN HIS OWN TEACHER
Few people ever knew so many things as Franklin Men said How did he
ever learn so many things For he had been a poor boy who had to work
for a living He could not go to school at all after he was ten
years old
His father made soap and candles Little Ben Franklin had to cut
wicks for the candles He also filled the candle molds And he sold
soap and candles and ran on errands But when he was not at work he
spent his time in reading good books What little money he got he used
to buy books with
He read the old story of Pilgrims Progress and liked it so well
that he bought all the other stories by the same man But as he wanted
more books and had not money to buy them he sold all of these
books The next he bought were some little history books These were
made to sell very cheap and they were sold by peddlers He managed to
buy forty or fifty of these little books of history
Another way that he had of learning was by seeing things with his own
eyes His father took him to see carpenters at work with their saws
and planes He also saw masons laying bricks And he went to see men
making brass and copper kettles And he saw a man with a turning lathe
making the round legs of chairs Other men were at work making knives
Some things people learn out of books and some things they have to
see for themselves
As he was fond of books Bens father thought that it would be a good
plan to send him to learn to print them So the boy went to work in
his brothers printing office Here he passed his spare time in
reading He borrowed some books out of the stores where books were
sold He would sit up a great part of the night sometimes to read one
of these books He wished to return it when the bookstore opened in
the morning One man who had many books lent to Ben such of his books
as he wanted
It was part of the bargain that Bens brother should pay his board
The boy offered to board himself if his brother would give him half
what it cost to pay for his board
Illustration Franklin at Study
His brother was glad to do this and Ben saved part of the money and
bought books with it He was a healthy boy and it did not hurt him
to live mostly on bread and butter Sometimes he bought a little pie
or a handful of raisins
Long before he was a man people said How much the boy knows This
was because
He did not waste his time
He read good books
He saw things for himself
HOW FRANKLIN FOUND OUT THINGS
Franklin thought that ants know how to tell things to one another He
thought that they talk by some kind of signs When an ant has found a
dead fly too big for him to drag away he will run off and get some
other ant to help him Franklin thought that ants have some way of
telling other ants that there is work to do
One day he found some ants eating molasses out of a little jar in a
closet He shook them out Then he tied a string to the jar and hung
it on a nail in the ceiling But he had not got all the ants out of
the jar One little ant liked sweet things so well that he staid in
the jar and kept on eating like a greedy boy
Illustration Ants talking magnified
At last when this greedy ant had eaten all that he could he started
to go home Franklin saw him climb over the rim of the jar Then the
ant ran down the outside of the jar But when he got to the bottom he
did not find any shelf there He went all round the jar There was no
way to get down to the floor The ant ran this way and that way but
he could not get down
Illustration An Ants Feeler magnified
At last the greedy ant thought he would see if he could go up He
climbed up the string to the ceiling Then he went down the wall He
came to his own hole at last no doubt
After a while he got hungry again perhaps He thought about that jar
of sweets at the end of a string Then perhaps he told the other ants
Maybe he let them know that there was a string by which they could get
down to the jar
In about half an hour after the ant had gone up the string Franklin
saw a swarm of ants going down the string They marched in a line one
after another Soon there were two lines of ants on the string The
ants in one line were going down to get at the sweet food The ants in
the other line were marching up the other side of the string to go
home Do you think that the greedy ant told the other ants about
the jar
And did he tell them that there was a string by which an ant could get
there
And did he tell it by speaking or by signs that he made with his
feelers
If you watch two ants when they meet you will see that they touch
their feelers together as if they said Goodmorning
Illustration FRANKLIN ASKS THE SUNSHINE SOMETHING
One day Franklin was eating dinner at the house of a friend The lady
of the house when she poured out the coffee found that it was
not hot
She said I am sorry that the coffee is cold It is because the
servant forgot to scour the coffeepot Coffee gets cold more quickly
when the coffeepot is not bright
This set Franklin to thinking He thought that a black or dull thing
would cool more quickly than a white or bright one That made him
think that a black thing would take in heat more quickly than a
white one
He wanted to find out if this were true or not There was nobody who
knew so there was nobody to ask But Franklin thought that he would
ask the sunshine Maybe the sunshine would tell him whether a black
thing would heat more quickly than a white thing
But how could he ask the sunshine
There was snow on the ground Franklin spread a white cloth on the
snow Then he spread a black cloth on the snow near the white one
When he came to look at them he saw that the snow under the black
cloth melted away much sooner than that under the white cloth
That is the way that the sunshine told him that black would take in
heat more quickly than white After he had found this out many people
got white hats to wear in the summer time A white hat is cooler than
a black one
Some time when there is snow on the ground you can take a white and a
black cloth and ask the sunshine the same question
FRANKLIN AND THE KITE
When Franklin wanted to know whether the ants could talk or not he
asked the ants and they told him When he wanted to know something
else he asked the sunshine about it as you have read in another
story That is the way that Franklin came to know so many things He
knew how to ask questions of everything
Once he asked the lightning a question And the lightning gave him
an answer
Before the time of Franklin people did not know what lightning was
They did not know what made the thunder Franklin thought much about
it At last he proved what it was He asked the lightning a question
and made it tell what it was To tell you this story I shall have
to use one big word Maybe it is too big for some of my little friends
that will read this book Let us divide it into parts Then you will
not be afraid of it The big word is electricity
Those of you who live in towns have seen the streets lighted by
electricity But in Franklins time there were no such lights
People knew very little about this strange thing with a big name
But Franklin found out many things about it that nobody had ever known
before He began to think that the little sparks he got from
electricity were small flashes of lightning He thought that the
little cracking sound of these sparks was a kind of baby thunder
So he thought that he would try to catch a little bit of lightning
Perhaps he could put it into one of the little bottles used to hold
electricity Then if it behaved like electricity he would
know what it was But catching lightning is not easy How do you think
he did it
First he made a kite It was not a kite just like a boys kite He
wanted a kite that would fly when it rained Rain would spoil a paper
kite in a minute So Franklin used a silk handkerchief to cover his
kite instead of paper
Illustration Franklins Discovery
He put a little sharppointed wire at the top of his kite This was
a kind of lightning rod to draw the lightning into the kite His kite
string was a common hemp string To this he tied a key because
lightning will follow metal The end of the string that he held in his
hand was a silk ribbon which was tied to the hemp string of the kite
Electricity will not follow silk
One night when there was a storm coming he went out with his son
They stood under a cow shed and he sent his kite up in the air
Illustration
After a while he held his knuckle to the key A tiny spark flashed
between the key and his knuckle It was a little flash of lightning
Then he took his little bottle fixed to hold electricity He
filled it with the electricity that came from the key He carried
home a bottle of lightning So he found out what made it thunder
and lighten
After that he used to bring the lightning into his house on rods and
wires He made the lightning ring bells and do many other
strange things
