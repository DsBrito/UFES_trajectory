personal character and unfortunately they prevented him from completing
his work The trouble is that he made his art out of life and when in
his final years he carried his struggle as Tolstoi did later back into
life he repented of all he had written and in the frenzy of a wakeful
night burned all his manuscripts including the second part of Dead
Souls only fragments of which were saved There was yet a third part to
be written Indeed the second part had been written and burned twice
Accounts differ as to why he had burned it finally Religious remorse
fury at adverse criticism and despair at not reaching ideal perfection
are among the reasons given Again it is said that he had destroyed the
manuscript with the others inadvertently
The poet Pushkin who said of Gogol that behind his laughter you feel
the unseen tears was his chief friend and inspirer It was he who
suggested the plot of Dead Souls as well as the plot of the earlier work
The Revisor which is almost the only comedy in Russian The importance
of both is their introduction of the social element in Russian
literature as Prince Kropotkin points out Both hold up the mirror
to Russian officialdom and the effects it has produced on the national
character The plot of Dead Souls is simple enough and is said to have
been suggested by an actual episode
It was the day of serfdom in Russia and a mans standing was often
judged by the numbers of souls he possessed There was a periodical
census of serfs say once every ten or twenty years This being the
case an owner had to pay a tax on every soul registered at the
last census though some of the serfs might have died in the meantime
Nevertheless the system had its material advantages inasmuch as an
owner might borrow money from a bank on the dead souls no less than
on the living ones The plan of Chichikov Gogols herovillain was
therefore to make a journey through Russia and buy up the dead souls
at reduced rates of course saving their owners the government tax
and acquiring for himself a list of fictitious serfs which he meant to
mortgage to a bank for a considerable sum With this money he would buy
an estate and some real life serfs and make the beginning of a fortune
Obviously this plot which is really no plot at all but merely a ruse
to enable Chichikov to go across Russia in a troika with Selifan the
coachman as a sort of Russian Sancho Panza gives Gogol a magnificent
opportunity to reveal his genius as a painter of Russian panorama
peopled with characteristic native types commonplace enough but drawn in
comic relief The comic explained the author yet at the beginning of
his career is hidden everywhere only living in the midst of it we are
not conscious of it but if the artist brings it into his art on the
stage say we shall roll about with laughter and only wonder we did not
notice it before But the comic in Dead Souls is merely external Let
us see how Pushkin who loved to laugh regarded the work As Gogol read
it aloud to him from the manuscript the poet grew more and more gloomy
and at last cried out God What a sad country Russia is And later he
said of it Gogol invents nothing it is the simple truth the terrible
truth
The work on one hand was received as nothing less than an exposure of
all Russiawhat would foreigners think of it The liberal elements
however the critical Belinsky among them welcomed it as a revelation
as an omen of a freer future Gogol who had meant to do a service to
Russia and not to heap ridicule upon her took the criticisms of the
Slavophiles to heart and he palliated his critics by promising to bring
about in the succeeding parts of his novel the redemption of Chichikov
and the other knaves and blockheads But the Westerner Belinsky
and others of the liberal camp were mistrustful It was about this time
1847 that Gogol published his Correspondence with Friends and aroused
a literary controversy that is alive to this day Tolstoi is to be found
among his apologists
Opinions as to the actual significance of Gogols masterpiece differ
Some consider the author a realist who has drawn with meticulous detail
a picture of Russia others Merejkovsky among them see in him a great
symbolist the very title Dead Souls is taken to describe the living of
Russia as well as its dead Chichikov himself is now generally regarded
as a universal character We find an American professor William Lyon
Phelps 1 of Yale holding the opinion that no one can travel far in
America without meeting scores of Chichikovs indeed he is an accurate
portrait of the American promoter of the successful commercial
traveller whose success depends entirely not on the real value and
usefulness of his stockintrade but on his knowledge of human nature
and of the persuasive power of his tongue This is also the opinion
held by Prince Kropotkin 2 who says Chichikov may buy dead
souls or railway shares or he may collect funds for some charitable
institution or look for a position in a bank but he is an immortal
international type we meet him everywhere he is of all lands and of
all times he but takes different forms to suit the requirements of
nationality and time
Again the work bears an interesting relation to Gogol himself A
romantic writing of realities he was appalled at the commonplaces
of life at finding no outlet for his love of colour derived from his
Cossack ancestry He realised that he had drawn a host of heroes one
more commonplace than another that there was not a single palliating
circumstance that there was not a single place where the reader might
find pause to rest and to console himself and that when he had finished
the book it was as though he had walked out of an oppressive cellar
into the open air He felt perhaps inward need to redeem Chichikov
in Merejkovskys opinion he really wanted to save his own soul but
had succeeded only in losing it His last years were spent morbidly
he suffered torments and ran from place to place like one hunted but
really always running from himself Rome was his favourite refuge and
he returned to it again and again In 1848 he made a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land but he could find no peace for his soul Something of this
mood had reflected itself even much earlier in the Memoirs of a Madman
Oh little mother save your poor son Look how they are tormenting
him Theres no place for him on earth Hes being driven Oh
little mother take pity on thy poor child
All the contradictions of Gogols character are not to be disposed of
in a brief essay Such a strange combination of the tragic and the comic
was truly seldom seen in one man He for one realised that it is
dangerous to jest with laughter Everything that I laughed at became
sad And terrible adds Merejkovsky But earlier his humour was
lighter less tinged with the tragic in those days Pushkin never failed
to be amused by what Gogol had brought to read to him Even Revizor
1835 with its tragic undercurrent was a trifle compared to Dead
Souls so that one is not astonished to hear that not only did the Tsar
Nicholas I give permission to have it acted in spite of its being a
criticism of official rottenness but laughed uproariously and led the
applause Moreover he gave Gogol a grant of money and asked that its
source should not be revealed to the author lest he might feel obliged
to write from the official point of view
Gogol was born at Sorotchinetz Little Russia in March 1809 He left
college at nineteen and went to St Petersburg where he secured a
position as copying clerk in a government department He did not keep
his position long yet long enough to store away in his mind a number of
bureaucratic types which proved useful later He quite suddenly started
for America with money given to him by his mother for another purpose
but when he got as far as Lubeck he turned back He then wanted to
become an actor but his voice proved not strong enough Later he wrote
a poem which was unkindly received As the copies remained unsold he
gathered them all up at the various shops and burned them in his room
His next effort Evenings at the Farm of Dikanka 1831 was more
successful It was a series of gay and colourful pictures of Ukraine
the land he knew and loved and if he is occasionally a little over
romantic here and there he also achieves some beautifully lyrical
passages Then came another even finer series called Mirgorod which won
the admiration of Pushkin Next he planned a History of Little Russia
and a History of the Middle Ages this last work to be in eight or
nine volumes The result of all this study was a beautiful and short
Homeric epic in prose called Taras Bulba His appointment to a
professorship in history was a ridiculous episode in his life After a
brilliant first lecture in which he had evidently said all he had to
say he settled to a life of boredom for himself and his pupils When he
resigned he said joyously I am once more a free Cossack Between
1834 and 1835 he produced a new series of stories including his famous
Cloak which may be regarded as the legitimate beginning of the Russian
novel
Gogol knew little about women who played an equally minor role in
his life and in his books This may be partly because his personal
appearance was not prepossessing He is described by a contemporary as
a little man with legs too short for his body He walked crookedly he
was clumsy illdressed and rather ridiculouslooking with his long
lock of hair flapping on his forehead and his large prominent nose
From 1835 Gogol spent almost his entire time abroad some strange
unrestpossibly his Cossack bloodpossessed him like a demon and
he never stopped anywhere very long After his pilgrimage in 1848 to
Jerusalem he returned to Moscow his entire possessions in a little
bag these consisted of pamphlets critiques and newspaper articles
mostly inimical to himself He wandered about with these from house to
house Everything he had of value he gave away to the poor He ceased
work entirely According to all accounts he spent his last days in
praying and fasting Visions came to him His death which came in 1852
was extremely fantastic His last words uttered in a loud frenzy
were A ladder Quick a ladder This call for a laddera spiritual
ladder in the words of Merejkovskyhad been made on an earlier
occasion by a certain Russian saint who used almost the same language
I shall laugh my bitter laugh 3 was the inscription placed on
Gogols grave

AUTHORS PREFACE TO THE FIRST PORTION OF THIS WORK
Second Edition published in 1846
From the Author to the Reader
Reader whosoever or wheresoever you be and whatsoever be your
stationwhether that of a member of the higher ranks of society or that
of a member of the plainer walks of lifeI beg of you if God shall
have given you any skill in letters and my book shall fall into your
hands to extend to me your assistance
For in the book which lies before you and which probably you have
read in its first edition there is portrayed a man who is a type taken
from our Russian Empire This man travels about the Russian land and
meets with folk of every conditionfrom the noblyborn to the humble
toiler Him I have taken as a type to show forth the vices and the
failings rather than the merits and the virtues of the commonplace
Russian individual and the characters which revolve around him have
also been selected for the purpose of demonstrating our national
weaknesses and shortcomings As for men and women of the better sort I
propose to portray them in subsequent volumes Probably much of what I
have described is improbable and does not happen as things customarily
happen in Russia and the reason for that is that for me to learn all
that I have wished to do has been impossible in that human life is not
sufficiently long to become acquainted with even a hundredth part
of what takes place within the borders of the Russian Empire Also
carelessness inexperience and lack of time have led to my perpetrating
numerous errors and inaccuracies of detail with the result that in
every line of the book there is something which calls for correction
For these reasons I beg of you my reader to act also as my corrector
Do not despise the task for however superior be your education and
however lofty your station and however insignificant in your eyes
my book and however trifling the apparent labour of correcting and
commenting upon that book I implore you to do as I have said And you
too O reader of lowly education and simple status I beseech you not to
look upon yourself as too ignorant to be able in some fashion however
small to help me Every man who has lived in the world and mixed with
his fellow men will have remarked something which has remained hidden
from the eyes of others and therefore I beg of you not to deprive me
of your comments seeing that it cannot be that should you read my book
with attention you will have NOTHING to say at some point therein
For example how excellent it would be if some reader who is
sufficiently rich in experience and the knowledge of life to be
acquainted with the sort of characters which I have described herein
would annotate in detail the book without missing a single page and
undertake to read it precisely as though laying pen and paper before
him he were first to peruse a few pages of the work and then to recall
his own life and the lives of folk with whom he has come in contact
and everything which he has seen with his own eyes or has heard of from
others and to proceed to annotate in so far as may tally with his own
experience or otherwise what is set forth in the book and to jot down
the whole exactly as it stands pictured to his memory and lastly to
send me the jottings as they may issue from his pen and to continue
doing so until he has covered the entire work Yes he would indeed do
me a vital service Of style or beauty of expression he would need
to take no account for the value of a book lies in its truth and its
actuality rather than in its wording Nor would he need to consider my
feelings if at any point he should feel minded to blame or to upbraid
me or to demonstrate the harm rather than the good which has been
done through any lack of thought or verisimilitude of which I have
been guilty In short for anything and for everything in the way of
criticism I should be thankful
Also it would be an excellent thing if some reader in the higher walks
of life some person who stands remote both by life and by education
from the circle of folk which I have pictured in my book but who knows
the life of the circle in which he himself revolves would undertake to
read my work in similar fashion and methodically to recall to his mind
any members of superior social classes whom he has met and carefully to
observe whether there exists any resemblance between one such class and
another and whether at times there may not be repeated in a higher
sphere what is done in a lower and likewise to note any additional fact
in the same connection which may occur to him that is to say any fact
pertaining to the higher ranks of society which would seem to confirm or
to disprove his conclusions and lastly to record that fact as it may
have occurred within his own experience while giving full details of
persons of individual manners tendencies and customs and also of
inanimate surroundings of dress furniture fittings of houses and so
forth For I need knowledge of the classes in question which are the
flower of our people In fact this very reasonthe reason that I do
not yet know Russian life in all its aspects and in the degree to
which it is necessary for me to know it in order to become a successful
authoris what has until now prevented me from publishing any
subsequent volumes of this story
Again it would be an excellent thing if some one who is endowed with
the faculty of imagining and vividly picturing to himself the various
situations wherein a character may be placed and of mentally following
up a characters career in one field and anotherby this I mean some
one who possesses the power of entering into and developing the ideas
of the author whose work he may be readingwould scan each character
herein portrayed and tell me how each character ought to have acted
at a given juncture and what to judge from the beginnings of each
character ought to have become of that character later and what new
circumstances might be devised in connection therewith and what new
details might advantageously be added to those already described
Honestly can I say that to consider these points against the time when a
new edition of my book may be published in a different and a better form
would give me the greatest possible pleasure
One thing in particular would I ask of any reader who may be willing to
give me the benefit of his advice That is to say I would beg of him
to suppose while recording his remarks that it is for the benefit of
a man in no way his equal in education or similar to him in tastes and
ideas or capable of apprehending criticisms without full explanation
appended that he is doing so Rather would I ask such a reader to
suppose that before him there stands a man of incomparably inferior
enlightenment and schoolinga rude country bumpkin whose life
throughout has been passed in retirementa bumpkin to whom it is
necessary to explain each circumstance in detail while never forgetting
to be as simple of speech as though he were a child and at every step
there were a danger of employing terms beyond his understanding Should
these precautions be kept constantly in view by any reader undertaking
to annotate my book that readers remarks will exceed in weight
and interest even his own expectations and will bring me very real
advantage
Thus provided that my earnest request be heeded by my readers and
that among them there be found a few kind spirits to do as I desire the
following is the manner in which I would request them to transmit their
notes for my consideration Inscribing the package with my name let
them then enclose that package in a second one addressed either to the
Rector of the University of St Petersburg or to Professor Shevirev of
the University of Moscow according as the one or the other of those two
cities may be the nearer to the sender
Lastly while thanking all journalists and litterateurs for their
previously published criticisms of my bookcriticisms which in spite
of a spice of that intemperance and prejudice which is common to all
humanity have proved of the greatest use both to my head and to my
heartI beg of such writers again to favour me with their reviews For
in all sincerity I can assure them that whatsoever they may be pleased
to say for my improvement and my instruction will be received by me with
naught but gratitude
DEAD SOULS
PART I
CHAPTER I
To the door of an inn in the provincial town of N there drew up a smart
britchkaa light springcarriage of the sort affected by bachelors
retired lieutenantcolonels staffcaptains landowners possessed of
about a hundred souls and in short all persons who rank as gentlemen
of the intermediate category In the britchka was seated such a
gentlemana man who though not handsome was not illfavoured not
overfat and not overthin Also though not overelderly he was
not overyoung His arrival produced no stir in the town and was
accompanied by no particular incident beyond that a couple of peasants
who happened to be standing at the door of a dramshop exchanged a few
comments with reference to the equipage rather than to the individual
who was seated in it Look at that carriage one of them said to the
other Think you it will be going as far as Moscow I think it will
replied his companion But not as far as Kazan eh No not as far as
Kazan With that the conversation ended Presently as the britchka was
approaching the inn it was met by a young man in a pair of very short
very tight breeches of white dimity a quasifashionable frockcoat and
a dickey fastened with a pistolshaped bronze tiepin The young man
turned his head as he passed the britchka and eyed it attentively
after which he clapped his hand to his cap which was in danger of being
removed by the wind and resumed his way On the vehicle reaching the
inn door its occupant found standing there to welcome him the polevoi
or waiter of the establishmentan individual of such nimble and
brisk movement that even to distinguish the character of his face was
impossible Running out with a napkin in one hand and his lanky form
clad in a tailcoat reaching almost to the nape of his neck he tossed
back his locks and escorted the gentleman upstairs along a wooden
gallery and so to the bedchamber which God had prepared for the
gentlemans reception The said bedchamber was of quite ordinary
appearance since the inn belonged to the species to be found in all
provincial townsthe species wherein for two roubles a day travellers
may obtain a room swarming with blackbeetles and communicating by a
doorway with the apartment adjoining True the doorway may be blocked
up with a wardrobe yet behind it in all probability there will be
standing a silent motionless neighbour whose ears are burning to learn
every possible detail concerning the latest arrival The inns exterior
corresponded with its interior Long and consisting only of two
storeys the building had its lower half destitute of stucco with the
result that the darkred bricks originally more or less dingy had
grown yet dingier under the influence of atmospheric changes As for the
upper half of the building it was of course painted the usual tint
of unfading yellow Within on the ground floor there stood a number
of benches heaped with horsecollars rope and sheepskins while the
windowseat accommodated a sbitentshik 4 cheek by jowl with a samovar
5the latter so closely resembling the former in appearance that but
for the fact of the samovar possessing a pitchblack lip the samovar
and the sbitentshik might have been two of a pair
During the travellers inspection of his room his luggage was brought
into the apartment First came a portmanteau of white leather whose
raggedness indicated that the receptacle had made several previous
journeys The bearers of the same were the gentlemans coachman
Selifan a little man in a large overcoat and the gentlemans
valet Petrushkathe latter a fellow of about thirty clad in a worn
overample jacket which formerly had graced his masters shoulders and
possessed of a nose and a pair of lips whose coarseness communicated to
his face rather a sullen expression Behind the portmanteau came a
small dispatchbox of redwood lined with birch bark a bootcase
and wrapped in blue paper a roast fowl all of which having been
deposited the coachman departed to look after his horses and the valet
to establish himself in the little dark anteroom or kennel where already
he had stored a cloak a bagful of livery and his own peculiar smell
Pressing the narrow bedstead back against the wall he covered it with
the tiny remnant of mattressa remnant as thin and flat perhaps also
as greasy as a pancakewhich he had managed to beg of the landlord of
the establishment
While the attendants had been thus setting things straight the gentleman
had repaired to the common parlour The appearance of common parlours of
the kind is known to every one who travels Always they have varnished
walls which grown black in their upper portions with tobacco smoke
are in their lower grown shiny with the friction of customers
backsmore especially with that of the backs of such local tradesmen
as on marketdays make it their regular practice to resort to
the local hostelry for a glass of tea Also parlours of this kind
invariably contain smutty ceilings an equally smutty chandelier a
number of pendent shades which jump and rattle whenever the waiter
scurries across the shabby oilcloth with a trayful of glasses the
glasses looking like a flock of birds roosting by the seashore and a
selection of oil paintings In short there are certain objects which
one sees in every inn In the present case the only outstanding feature
of the room was the fact that in one of the paintings a nymph was
portrayed as possessing breasts of a size such as the reader can never
in his life have beheld A similar caricaturing of nature is to be noted
in the historical pictures of unknown origin period and creation
which reach ussometimes through the instrumentality of Russian
magnates who profess to be connoisseurs of artfrom Italy owing to
the said magnates having made such purchases solely on the advice of the
couriers who have escorted them
To resume howeverour traveller removed his cap and divested his neck
of a particoloured woollen scarf of the kind which a wife makes for
her husband with her own hands while accompanying the gift with
interminable injunctions as to how best such a garment ought to be
folded True bachelors also wear similar gauds but in their case
God alone knows who may have manufactured the articles For my part
I cannot endure them Having unfolded the scarf the gentleman ordered
dinner and whilst the various dishes were being got readycabbage
soup a pie several weeks old a dish of marrow and peas a dish of
sausages and cabbage a roast fowl some salted cucumber and the sweet
tart which stands perpetually ready for use in such establishments
whilst I say these things were either being warmed up or brought in
cold the gentleman induced the waiter to retail certain fragments of
tittletattle concerning the late landlord of the hostelry the amount
of income which the hostelry produced and the character of its present
proprietor To the lastmentioned inquiry the waiter returned the answer
invariably given in such casesnamely My master is a terribly hard
man sir Curious that in enlightened Russia so many people cannot even
take a meal at an inn without chattering to the attendant and making
free with him Nevertheless not ALL the questions which the gentleman
asked were aimless ones for he inquired who was Governor of the town
who President of the Local Council and who Public Prosecutor In short
he omitted no single official of note while asking also though with an
air of detachment the most exact particulars concerning the landowners
of the neighbourhood Which of them he inquired possessed serfs and
how many of them How far from the town did those landowners reside
What was the character of each landowner and was he in the habit of
paying frequent visits to the town The gentleman also made searching
inquiries concerning the hygienic condition of the countryside Was
there he asked much sickness aboutwhether sporadic fever fatal
forms of ague smallpox or what not Yet though his solicitude
concerning these matters showed more than ordinary curiosity his
bearing retained its gravity unimpaired and from time to time he
blew his nose with portentous fervour Indeed the manner in which he
accomplished this latter feat was marvellous in the extreme for though
that member emitted sounds equal to those of a trumpet in intensity
he could yet with his accompanying air of guileless dignity evoke the
waiters undivided respectso much so that whenever the sounds of
the nose reached that menials ears he would shake back his locks
straighten himself into a posture of marked solicitude and inquire
afresh with head slightly inclined whether the gentleman happened
to require anything further After dinner the guest consumed a cup of
coffee and then seating himself upon the sofa with behind him
one of those woolcovered cushions which in Russian taverns
resemble nothing so much as a cobblestone or a brick fell to snoring
whereafter returning with a start to consciousness he ordered himself
to be conducted to his room flung himself at full length upon the bed
and once more slept soundly for a couple of hours Aroused eventually
by the waiter he at the latters request inscribed a fragment of
paper with his name his surname and his rank for communication in
accordance with the law to the police and on that paper the waiter
leaning forward from the corridor read syllable by syllable Paul
Ivanovitch Chichikov Collegiate CouncillorLandownerTravelling
on Private Affairs The waiter had just time to accomplish this
feat before Paul Ivanovitch Chichikov set forth to inspect the town
Apparently the place succeeded in satisfying him and to tell the
truth it was at least up to the usual standard of our provincial
capitals Where the staring yellow of stone edifices did not greet his
eye he found himself confronted with the more modest grey of wooden
ones which consisting for the most part of one or two storeys added
to the range of attics which provincial architects love so well looked
almost lost amid the expanses of street and intervening medleys of
broken or halffinished partitionwalls At other points evidence of
more life and movement was to be seen and here the houses stood crowded
together and displayed dilapidated rainblurred signboards whereon
boots of cakes or pairs of blue breeches inscribed Arshavski Tailor
and so forth were depicted Over a shop containing hats and caps
was written Vassili Thedorov Foreigner while at another spot a
signboard portrayed a billiard table and two playersthe latter clad
in frockcoats of the kind usually affected by actors whose part it is
to enter the stage during the closing act of a piece even though with
arms sharply crooked and legs slightly bent the said billiard players
were taking the most careful aim but succeeding only in making abortive
strokes in the air Each emporium of the sort had written over it This
is the best establishment of its kind in the town Also al fresco in
the streets there stood tables heaped with nuts soap and gingerbread
the latter but little distinguishable from the soap and at an
eatinghouse there was displayed the sign of a plump fish transfixed
with a gaff But the sign most frequently to be discerned was the
insignia of the State the doubleheaded eagle now replaced in this
connection with the laconic inscription Dramshop As for the paving
of the town it was uniformly bad
The gentleman peered also into the municipal gardens which contained
only a few sorry trees that were poorly selected requiring to be
propped with oilpainted triangular green supports and able to boast
of a height no greater than that of an ordinary walkingstick Yet
recently the local paper had said apropos of a gala that Thanks to
the efforts of our Civil Governor the town has become enriched with a
pleasaunce full of umbrageous spaciouslybranching trees Even on the
most sultry day they afford agreeable shade and indeed gratifying
was it to see the hearts of our citizens panting with an impulse of
gratitude as their eyes shed tears in recognition of all that their
Governor has done for them
Next after inquiring of a gendarme as to the best ways and means of
finding the local council the local lawcourts and the local Governor
should he Chichikov have need of them the gentleman went on to
inspect the river which ran through the town En route he tore off a
notice affixed to a post in order that he might the more conveniently
read it after his return to the inn Also he bestowed upon a lady
of pleasant exterior who escorted by a footman laden with a bundle
happened to be passing along a wooden sidewalk a prolonged stare
Lastly he threw around him a comprehensive glance as though to fix in
his mind the general topography of the place and betook himself
home There gently aided by the waiter he ascended the stairs to his
bedroom drank a glass of tea and seating himself at the table called
