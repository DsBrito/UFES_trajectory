the storm awakened at last in the snowshovellers and in the men and
women who gasped and stumbled along the choked thoroughfares a sort of
heady exhilaration in the emergency a tendency to be proud of the
storm and of its effect upon their humdrum lives They laughed and
shouted as they battled with it and as Natures great barrier of snow
threw down the little barriers of convention and shyness Men held out
their hands to slipping and stumbling women caught them by their
shoulders panted to them that this was a storm all right this was
the worst yet Girls staggering in through the revolving glass doors
of the big department stores must stand laughing helplessly for a few
seconds in the gush of reviving warmth while they beat their wet
gloves together regaining breath and selfpossession and straightened
outraged millinery
Traffic was congested deserted trucks and motorcars lined the side
streets the subways were jammed the surface cars helpless Here and
there long lines of the omnibuses stood blocked in snow and the press
frantically heralded impending shortages of milk and coal reiterating
pessimistically No relief in sight
But late in Saturday morning there was a sudden lull The snow stopped
the wind fell and the pure cold air was motionless and sweet The city
emerged exhausted from its temporary blanketing and from the buried
benches of Bowling Green to the virgin sweep of pure white beyond Van
Cortlandt Park began its usual January fight with the snow
A handsome rosy old lady wrapped regally in furs and with a maid
picking her way cautiously beside her was one of the first to take
advantage of the sudden change in the weather Mrs Melrose had been
held captive for almost two days first by Thursdays inclement winds
and then by the blizzard Her motorcar was useless and although at
sixty she was an extremely youthful and vigorous woman her daughters
and granddaughter had threatened to use force rather than let her risk
the danger of an expedition on foot at least while the storm continued
But now the wind was gone and by the time Mrs Melrose had been
properly shod and coated and hatted there was even a dull glimmer
toward the southeast that indicated the location of the longlost sun
The old lady looked her approval at Fifth Avenue with all its crudities
veiled and softened by the snowfall and as she climbed into an omnibus
expressed herself firmly to Regina
You mark my words the sun will be out before we come home
Regina punching the two dimes carefully into the jolting receiver made
only a respectful murmur for answer She was like many a maid a snob
where her mistress was concerned and she did not like to have Mrs
Melrose ride in public omnibuses For Regina herself it did not matter
but Mrs Melrose was one of the citys prominent and wealthy women and
Regina could not remember that she had ever sunk to the use of a public
conveyance before today The maid was glad when they descended at a
street in the East Sixties They would probably be sent home she
reflected in Mrs Liggetts car For Regina noticed that private cars
were beginning to grind and slip over the snow again
Old Mrs Melrose was going to see her daughter Alice who was Mrs
Christopher Liggett because Alice was an invalid It had been only a
few years after Alices most felicitous marriage a dozen years ago
when an accident had laid the lovely and brilliant woman upon the bed of
helplessness that she might never leave again There was no real reason
why the spine should continue useless the great specialists said there
was a hopeeven a probabilitythat as Alice grew rested and strong
after the serious accident she might find herself walking again But
Alice had been a prisoner for ten years now and the mother and sister
who idolized her feared that she would never again be the old dancing
Alice and feared that she knew it What Christopher Liggett feared they
did not know He insisted that Alices illness was but temporary and
was tireless in his energetic pursuit of treatment for his wife
Everything must be hoped and everything must be tried and Alices
mother knew that one of the real crosses of her daughters life was
sorrowful pity for Chriss optimistic delusions
The young Liggetts had sold the old house of Christophers father an
immense brownstone mansion a few squares away and lived in a modern
flatfaced graystone house that rose five stories from the beautifully
arranged basement entrance There were stone benches at the entrance
and a great iron grill and two potted trees and the small square
windows were leaded and showed blossoming plants inside The three long
windows above gave upon a littleused formal drawingroom with a Gothic
fireplace of white stone at one end and a dim jumble of rich colours
and polished surfaces between that and the big piano at the other The
room at the back on this floor was an equally large and formal
diningroom gleaming with carved mahogany and fretted plate used only
on the rare occasions of a dinnerparty
But on the floor above the gracious mistress of the house had her
domain and here there was enough beauty and colour to make the whole
house live The front room cool all summer because it faced north and
warm all winter because of the great open fireplace that augmented the
furnace heat was Alices sittingroom comfortable beautiful and
exquisitely ordered None of the usual clutter of the invalid was there
The fireplace was of plain creamy tiling the rugs dulltoned upon a
dark polished floor There were only two canvases on the dovegray
walls and the six or seven photographs that were arranged together on
the top of one of the low plain builtin bookcases were framed alike
There were no meaningless vases no jars or trays or plaques or
ornaments in Alices room Her flowers she liked to see in shining glass
bowls her flattopped desk was severely bare
But the cretonne that dressed her big comfortable chairs and her couch
was bright with roses and parrots and hollyhocks and the same cretonne
with plain net undercurtaining hung at her four front windows The room
was big enough to accommodate besides even with an air of space and
simplicity the little grand piano that Christopher played for her
almost every night A great Persian tortoiseshell cat was at home here
and sometimes Alice had her magnificent parrot besides hanging himself
upside down on his gailypainted stand and veiling the beady sharp eye
with which he watched her The indulgent extravagance of her mother had
bound all the books that Alice loved in the same tone of stonyblue
vellum the countless cushions with which the aching back was so
skillfully packed were of the same dull tone and it pleased the persons
who loved her to amuse the prisoner sometimes with a ring in which her
favourite note was repeated or a chain of old lapislazuli that made
Alices appreciative blue eyes more blue
Back of Alices room was a den in which Christopher could conduct much
of his personal business and beyond that was the luxurious bathroom a
modern miracle of enamel tiling and shining glass Across the
sunflooded back of the house were Alices little bedroom nunlike in
its rigid austerity her nurses room adjoining and a square sunroom
giving glimpses of roofs and trim backgardens full of flowers with a
little fountain and goldfish a floor of dull pink tiling and plants in
great jars of Chinese enamel Christopher had planned this delightful
addition to Alices domain only a few years ago and with that
knowledge of her secret heart that only Christopher could claim had let
her share the pleasure of designing and arranging it It stretched out
across the west side of the spacious backyard almost touching the
branches of the great plane tree and when after the painful move to
her mothers house and the necessary absence during the building of it
Alice had been brought back to this new evidence of their love and
goodness she had buried her face against Christophers shoulder and
told him that she didnt think people with all the world to wander in
had ever had anything lovelier than this
One of the paintings that Alice might look at idly in the silence of
the winter noon was of a daisied meadow stretching between walls of
heavy summer woodland to the roof of a halfburied farmhouse in the
valley below The other picture was of the very mother who was coming
toward Alice now in the jolting omnibus But it was a younger mother
and a younger Alice that had been captured by the painters genius It
was a stout imperious magnificently gowned woman of not much more
than thirty in whose spreading silk lap a fair little girl was sitting
This little earnesteyed child was Alice at seven The splendid
darkeyed proudlooking boy of about fourteen who stood beside the
mother was Teddy her only son dead now for many years and perhaps
mercifully dead The fourth and last person pictured was the elder
daughter Annie who had been about nine years old then Alice
remembered Annie and Alice had been unusually alike even for sisters
but even then Annies fair aristocratic type of blonde prettiness had
been definite where Alices was vague and Annies expression had been
just a trifle haughty and discontented where Alices was always grave
and sweet Annie had almost been a beauty she was extremely and
conspicuously goodlooking even now when as Mrs Hendrick von Behrens
wife of a son of an old and wealthy Knickerbocker family she was
supreme in the very holy of holies of the citys social life
Mrs Melrose came unannounced upon her daughter today and Alices
colourless warm cheek flushed with happiness under her mothers fresh
cold kiss
Mummyyou darling But how did you get here Miss Slater says that the
streets are absolutely impassable
I came in the bus dear Mrs Melrose said very much pleased with
herself How warm and comfy you are in here darling But what did I
interrupt
You didnt interrupt anything Alice said quickly Chris telephoned
and hes bringing Henricithe Frenchman who wrote that play I loved
soto tea Isnt that fun Im so excitedand I think Chris was such a
duck to get hold of him I was translating it you know and Bowditch
who was here for dinner last night told me hed place it if I finished
it And now I can talk it over with Henrici himselfthanks to Chris
Chris met my man at the club and told him about me and he said he
would be charmed So I telephoned several persons and I tried to get
hold of Annie
Annie has a lunchand a board meeting at the hospital at four
Annies mother remembered and Leslie is at a girls luncheon
somewhere Annie had breakfast with me and was rushing off afterward
Shes quite wonderfully faithful about those things
Well but youll stay for lunch and tea too Mummy Alice pleaded
She was lying back in her pillows feasting her eyes upon her mothers
face with that peculiarly tense devotion that was part of her nature
Rarely did a day pass without their meeting and no detail touching
Annies life Annies boys or husband was too small to interest Alice
She was especially interested too in Leslie the eighteenyearold
daughter that her brother Theodore had left to his mothers care in
fact between the mother and daughters the one granddaughter and two
little grandsons and the two sonsinlaw of the Melrose family a deep
bond existed a bond of pride as well as affection It was one of their
favourite boasts that to the Melroses the unity and honour of the family
was the first consideration in the world
But today Mrs Melrose could not stay At one oclock she left Alice to
be put into her prettiest robe by the devoted Miss Slater saw with
satisfaction that preparations for tea were noiselessly under way
called Regina odorous of tea and mutton chops from the pantry and
went out into the quiet cold of the winter noon
The old Melrose house was a substantial roomy brownstone building in
Madison Avenue inconspicuous perhaps among several notoriously handsome
homes but irreproachably dignified none the less A few blocks below it
the commercial current of East Thirtyfourth Street ebbed and flowed a
few blocks north the great facade of the Grand Central Station shut off
the street completely Third Avenue behind it swarmed and rattled
alarmingly close and Broadway flared its impudent signs only five
minutes walk in the other direction but here in a little oasis of
quiet street two score of old families serenely held their place
against the rising tide and among them the Melroses confidently felt
themselves valued and significant
Mrs Melrose mounted her steps with the householders secret
complacency They were scrupulously brushed of the last trace of snow
and the heavy door at the top swung noiselessly open to admit her She
suddenly realized that she was very tired that her fur coat was heavy
and her back ached She swept straight to the dark old curving stairway
and mounted slowly
Joseph she said over her shoulder send luncheon upstairs please
And when Miss Leslie comes in tell her I should like to see her if it
isnt too late Anybody coming tonight
Mr von Behrens telephoned that he and Mr Liggett might come in for a
moment on his way to the banquet at the Waldorf Madam But that was
all
I may have dinner upstairs too if Leslie is going anywhere Mrs
Melrose said to herself mounting slowly And it seemed to her fatigue
very restful to find her big room warm and orderly her coal fire
burning behind the oldfashioned steel rods all the homely
comfortable treasures of her busy years awaiting her She sank into a
chair and Regina flew noiselessly about with slippers and a loose silk
robe Presently a maid was serving smokinghot bouillon and Mrs
Melrose felt herself relaxed and soothed it was good to be home
Yet there was trace of uneasiness of something almost like
apprehension in the look that wandered thoughtfully about the
overcrowded room Presently she reached a plump wellgroomed hand
toward the bell But when Regina came to stand expectantly near her
Mrs Melrose roused herself from a profound abstraction to assure her
that she had not rungit must have been a mistake
Miss Leslie hasnt come in
Not yet Madam Miss Melrose is at Miss Higginss luncheon
Yes but it was an early luncheon the grandmother said
discontentedly She was playing squash or tennis or something
Regina
Yes Madam
But Mrs Melrose was musing again
Regina I am expecting a caller at four oclock a Mrs Sheridan
Please see that she is shown up at once I want to see her here And
please
A pause Regina waited
Thats all her mistress announced suddenly
Alone again the old lady stirred her tea ruminated for a few moments
with narrowed eyes fixed on space recalled herself to her surroundings
and finished her cup
Her room was large filled with chairs and tables lamps and cushions
silver trays and lacquer boxes vases and jars and bowls gift books
and current magazines There was not an unbroken inch of surface
anywhere the walls were closely set with pictures of all sorts Along
the oldfashioned mantel a scalloped narrow shelf of marble was a
crowding line of photographs in silver frames and there were other
framed photographs all about the room There were the young mothers of
the late eighties seated to best display their bustles and their French
twists with heavyheaded infants in their tightly cased arms and there
were childrens pictures babes in shells in swings or leaning on
gates There were three Annies one in ringlets plaid silk and
tasselled boots at eight one magnificent in drawingroom plumes and a
recent one a cloudy study of the severely superb mother with a
sleekheaded widecollared boy on each side of her There was a
photograph of the son Theodore handsome sullen dressed in the fashion
of the opening century and there was more than one of Theodores
daughter the last of the Melroses Leslie had been a wideeyed sturdy
little girl who carried a perpetually surprised even a babyish
expression into her teens but her last pictures showed the debutante
the piquant and charming eighteenyearold whose knowingly tipped hat
and high fur collar left only a glimpse of pretty and pouting face
between
Leslie came in upon her grandmother at about three oclock She was
genuinely tired after an athletic morning at the club a luncheon amid
a group of chattering intimates and a walk with the young man whose
attentions to her were thrilling not only her grandmother and aunts but
the coolblooded little Leslie herself Acton Liggett was Christophers
only brother only relative indeed and promised already to be as great
a favourite as the irresistible Chris himself Both were rich both
finelooking straightforward honourable men proud of their own
integrity their longestablished family and their old firm Acton was
pleasantly at home in the Melrose Liggett and Von Behrens houses the
very maids loved him and his quiet singling out of Leslie for his
devotion had satisfied everyones sense of what was fitting and
delightful Pretty Leslie back from a summers idling with Aunt Annie
and the little boys in California and Hawaii had found Actons
admiration waiting for her with all the other joys of her debutante
winter
And even the critical Aunt Annie had to admit that the little minx was
managing the whole matter with consummate skill Leslie was not in the
least selfconscious with Acton she turned to him with all the artless
confidence of a little sister She asked him about her dancing partners
and about her gowns and she discussed with him all the various bits of
small gossip that concerned their own friends
Should I have said that Acton she would ask trustfully Shall I be
Marions bridesmaid Would youafter I refused Linda Fox you know I
dont like to dance with Louis Davis after what you told me what shall
I do when he comes up to me
Acton was twentyfive seven years her senior He advised her earnestly
over many a confidential cup of tea And just lately the grandmother
noticed exultantly hardly a day passed that did not find the young
couple together
How did Acton happen to meet you lovey she asked today apropos
of the walk
Why he telephoned Vesta Higginss and asked me how I was going to get
home I said walk There was no use trying motorcars anyway for they
were slipping and bumping terribly He said he was in the neighbourhood
and he came up Granny
She paused and her grandmother was conscious of a quickened heartbeat
The thoughtful almost tremulous tone was not like giddy little Leslie
Granny the girl repeated presently how old was my mother when she
got married
About twentytwo the old woman said
And how old was Aunt Annie when she did
Annies about thirtyseven her mother considered She was about
twentyfive But why dear
Nothing said Leslie and fell silent
She was still in the silk blouse and short homespun skirt that she had
worn at the athletic club luncheon but she had thrown aside her loose
woolly coat and the narrow furs that were no softer than her own fair
skin Flung back into a deep chair and relaxed after her vigorous day
she looked peculiarly childish and charming her grandmother thought
She was like both her aunts with Annies fair almost ashen hair and
Alices full pretty mouth But she was more squarely built than either
and a hint of a tip at the end of her nose gave her an expression at
once infantile and astonished When Leslie opened her blue eyes widely
and stared at anything she looked like an amazed baby and the effect
of her round eyes and tilted nose was augmented by her very fair skin
and by just a sixteenth of an inch shortness in her upper lip Of course
she knew all this Her acquaintance with her own good and bad points had
begun in school days and while through her grandmothers care her
teeth were being straightened and her eyes and throat subjected to mild
forms of surgery her Aunt Annie had seen to it that her masses of fair
hair had been burnished and groomed her hands scraped and polished into
beauty and finally that her weight was watched with scrupulous care
Nature had perhaps intended Leslie to be plump and ruddy but modern
fashion had decreed otherwise and with half the girls of her own age
and set Leslie took saccharine in her tea rarely touched sweets or
fried food and had the supreme satisfaction of knowing that she was
actually too slim and too willowy for her height and interestingly
colourless into the bargain
Could Acton possibly have said anything definite to start this unusual
train of thought the grandmother speculated With Leslie so
felicitously married she would have felt ready for her nunc dimittis
She watched Leslie expectantly But the girl was apparently dreaming
and was staring absently at the tip of one sturdy oxford above which a
stretch of thick white woollen stocking was visible almost to her knee
How can they fall in love with them dressed like Welsh peasants the
grandmother said to herself in mild disapproval And aloud she said
Ah dont lovey
For Leslie had taken out a small gold case and was regarding it
thoughtfully
My first today on my honour Leslie said as she lazily lighted a
sweetscented cigarette It never occurred to her to pay any attention
to her grandmothers protest for Grandmother had been regularly
protesting against everything Leslie had done since her adored and
despotic childhood She had fainted when Leslie had dived off the dock
at Newport and had wept when Leslie had galloped through the big iron
gates on her own roan stallion she had called in Christopher as
Leslies guardian when Leslie at fifteen had calmly climbed into one
of the big cars and driven it seven miles alone and unadvised and
totally without instruction or experience Leslie knew that this
halfscandalized and whollyadmiring opposition was one of her
grandmothers secret satisfactions and she combatted it only
mechanically
Have one Grandma
Have oneyou wild girl you Id like to know what a nice young man
thinks when a refined girl offers him
All the nice young men are smoking themselves like chimneys
Ah but thats a very different thing No my dear no man whether he
smokes himself or not likes to have a sweet womanly girl descend
Darling didnt you ever do anything that my revered greatgrandmother
Murison disapproved of Leslie teased dropping on her knees before her
grandmother and resting her arms on her lap
Smoke My mother would have fainted said Mrs Melrose And dont
blow that nastysmelling stuff in my face
But she could not resist the pleasure that the lovely young face so
near her own gave her and she patted it with her soft wrinkled hand
Suddenly Leslie jumped up eagerly listening to the sound of voices in
the hall
Theres Aunt Annieoh goody I wanted to ask her
But it was Regina who opened the door showing in two callers The first
was a splendidlooking woman of perhaps fortyfive with a rosy
cheerful face and wide shrewd gray eyes shining under a somewhat
shabby mourning veil With her was a pretty girl of eighteen or perhaps
a little more
Leslie glanced astonished at her grandmother It was extremely unusual
to have callers shown in in this unceremonious fashion even if she had
been rather unprepossessed by these particular callers The younger
womans clothing indeed if plain was smart and simple her severe
tailormade had a collar of beaver fur to relieve its dark blue and her
little hat of blue beaver felt was trimmed only by a band of the same
fur She had attractive darkblue eyes and a flashing smile
But her companions comfortable dowdiness her black cotton gloves her
squarely built figure and worn shoes all awakened a certain contempt
in the granddaughter of the house and caused Leslie shrewdly to surmise
that these humble strangers were pensioners of her grandmother the
older one probably an old servant
Kate Sheridan Old Mrs Melrose had gotten to her feet and had put
her arm about the visitor Well my dear my dear Ive not seen you
theseWhat is it Dont tell me how many years it is And which
daughter is this
This is my niece Norma the older woman said in a delightful rich
voice that was full of easy confidence and friendliness This is Mrs
Melrose Norma darling that was such a good friend to me and mine
years ago
No warmer friend than you were to me Kate the old lady said
quickly still keeping an arm about the sturdy figure This is my
granddaughter Theodores little girl Mrs Melrose added catching
Leslie with her free hand
Leslie was not more of a snob than is natural to a girl of her age and
upbringing but she could not but give Mrs Sheridan a pretty cool
glance Grandmothers old friends were all very well
But Mrs Sheridan was studying her with affectionate freedom
And isnt she Miss Alices image But shes like you allshes like
Mr Theodore too especially through the eyes
And she turned back to her hostess interested animated and as
oblivious to Leslies hostile look as if the girl were her own picture
on the wall
And you and my Norma must know each other she said presently
watching the girls as they shook hands with a world of love and
solicitude in her eyes
Sit down both you two Mrs Melrose said Leslie glanced at the
strapped watch at her wrist
Grandmother I really she began
No you dont really her grandmother smiled Talk to Miss Sheridan
while I talkshe turned smiling to her old friendto Kate Tell me
how are you all Kate And where are you allyou were in Detroit
Weve been in New York more than two years now and why I havent been
to see you before perhaps you can tell me for I cant Kate
Sheridan said But my boy is a great big fellow now Wolfs
twentyfour and Rose is twentyone and this one she nodded toward
Norma who was exchanging comments on the great storm with Leslie this
one is nearly nineteen And you see theyre all working Wolfs doing
wonderfully with a firm of machine manufacturers in Newark and Rose
has been with one real estate firm since we came And Norma here works
in a bookstore up the Avenue a bit Birettas
Why I go in there nearly every week the old lady said
She told me the other night that she had been selling some books to Mr
Christopher Liggett and thats Miss Alices husband I hear said Mrs
Sheridan Shes in what they call the Old Book Room she added
lowering her voice Shes wonderful about books reads them and knows
them as if they were childrenthey think the world of her in there And
I keep house for the three of them and what with this and thatI never
have any time
But you have someone to help you Kate the old lady asked with her
amused and affectionate eyes on the others wholesome face
Why would I demanded Mrs Sheridan roundly The girls are a great
help
She always assumes a terrific brogue the minute you ask her why we
dont have someone in to help her Norma contributed with a sort of
shy and loving audacity Shell tell you in a minute that faith she
and her sister used to run barefoot over the primroses and they
blooming beyond anything the Lord ever created and the spring on
them
Leslie Melrose laughed out suddenly in delighted appreciation and the
tension between the two girls was over They had not quite known how to
talk to each other Norma naturally assuming that Leslie looked down
upon a seller of books and anxious to show her that she was unconscious
of either envy or inferiority and Leslie at a loss because her usual
social chatter was as foreign here as a strange tongue would be But no
type is quicker to grasp upon amusement and to appreciate the amuser
than Leslies unable to amuse itself and skilled in seeking for
entertainment She was too shy to ask Norma to imitate her aunt again
but her stiffness relaxed and she asked Norma if it was not great fun
to sell thingsespecially at Christmas for instance Norma asked in
turn if Mr Liggett was not Leslies uncle and said that she had sold
him hundreds of beautiful books for his wife and had even had a note
from Leslies Aunt Alice thanking her for some little courtesy
But isnt that funny Leslie said with her childish widening of the
eyes That you should know Chris
Well now said Mrs Sheridans voice cutting across both
conversations where can these girls go for about fifteen minutes Ill
tell you my little bit of business Mrs Melrose and then Norma and I
will go along It wont take me fifteen minutes for theres nothing to
decide today the girls heard her add comfortably as they went into
the hall
Leslie her grandmother called after her If you must change
dearbut wait a minute is that Aunt Annie out there
No Grandma just ourselves What were you going to say
I was going to say lovey that you could ask Miss Sheridan to wait in
the library her aunt tells me she is fond of books Mrs Melrose did
not quite like to commit Leslie to entertaining the strange girl for
perhaps half an hour She was pleasantly reassured by Leslies answering
voice
Well have tea in my room Grandma Marion and Doris may come in
Thats right have a good time her grandmother answered And then
settling back comfortably she added with her kind fussy superiority
Well Kate Ive wondered where you were hiding yourself all this time
Lets have the business But first I want to say that I appreciate your
turning to me If its moneyIve got it If its something else Chris
Liggett is one of the cleverest men in New York and well consult him
Its not money thank God Mrs Sheridan said in her forthright
voice Lord knows where it all comes from these days but the children
always have plenty she added glad of a diversion They bought
themselves a car two years ago and if it isnt a Victrola this week
its a thermos bottle or a pair of white buckskin shoes Rose told me
she paid eight dollars for her corsets Eight dollars for what I
said a dozen But then Ive the two houses in Brooklyn you know
You still have those
I have indeed And even the babywe call Norma the babyis earning
good money now
She has your name KateSheridan Had your husband a brother
Kate Sheridans face grew a trifle pale She glanced at the door to see
that it was shut and at the one to the adjoining room to make sure
that it was closed also Then she turned to Mrs Melrose and it was an
anxious glance she directed at the older woman
Well now theres no hurry about this she began and you may say
that its all nonsense and send me packingand God knows I hope you
will But it just began to get on my mindand Ive never been a great
one to worry Ill begin at the beginning
CHAPTER II
Marion Duer and Doris Alexander duly arrived for tea with Leslie and
Norma was introduced They all sat in Leslies room and laughed as they
reached for crumpets and marvelled at the storm Norma found them
rather younger than their years and shyly anxious to be gracious On
her part she realized with some surprise that they were not really
