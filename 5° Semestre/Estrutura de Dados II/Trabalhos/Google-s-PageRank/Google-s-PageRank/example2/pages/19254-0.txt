PARTICIPATION IN SECOND SEVEN YEAR PLAN
MESSAGE TO 1947 CONVENTION
My heart is filled with delight wonder pride and gratitude in
contemplation of the peacetime exploits in both hemispheres of the
world community of the followers of the Faith of BahAauallAh triumphantly
emerging from the crucible of global war and moving irresistibly into the
second epoch of the Formative Age of the BahAaA Dispensation
The opening years of the second century of the BahAaA Era synchronizing
with concluding stage of the memorable quartercentury elapsed since the
termination of the Heroic Age of the Faith have been distinguished by a
compelling demonstration by the entire body of believers headed by the
valorous American BahAaA Community of solidarity resolve and
selfsacrifice as well as by a magnificent record of systematic
worldwide achievements
The three years since the celebration of the Centenary have been
characterized by a simultaneous process of internal consolidation and
steady enlargement of the orbit of a fastevolving Administrative Order
These years witnessed first the astounding resurgence of a
wardevastated BahAaA community of Central Europe the rehabilitation of
the communities in Southeast Asia the Pacific Islands and the Far East
second the inauguration of a new Seven Year Plan by the American BahAaA
Community destined to culminate with the Centenary of the Birth of
BahAauallAhas Prophetic Mission aiming at the formation of three national
assemblies in Latin America and the Dominion of Canada at completion of
the holiest House of Worship in the BahAaA world and at the erection of
the structure of the Administrative Order in ten sovereign states of the
European continent and third the formulation by the British the Indian
and the Persian National Assemblies of Six Year Four and OneHalf Year
and FortyFive Month Plans respectively culminating with the Centenary of
the BAbas Martyrdom and pledged to establish nineteen spiritual assemblies
in the British Isles double the number of assemblies in the Indian
subcontinent establish ninetyfive new centers of the Faith in Persia
convert the groups in Bahrein Mecca and Kabul into assemblies and plant
the banner of the Faith in the Arabian territories of Yemen Oman Ahsa
and Kuweit
Moreover the number of countries opened to the onsweeping Faith and the
number of languages in which its literature has been translated and
printed is now raised to eightythree and fortyseven respectively Four
additional countries are in process of enrollment Translations into
fifteen other languages are being undertaken No less than seventeen
thousand pounds have accumulated for the international relief of
warafflicted BahAaA communities of East and West The BahAaA endowments
on the North American continent have now passed the two million dollar
mark The value of the endowments recently acquired at the World Center of
the Faith dedicated to the Shrines are estimated at thirtyfive thousand
pounds BahAaA literature has been disseminated as far north as Upernavik
Greenland above the Arctic Circle The BahAaA message has been broadcast
by radio as far south as Magallanes The area of land dedicated to the
MashriqualAdhkAr of Persia has increased by almost a quartermillion
square meters The number of localities in the Antipodes where BahAaAs
reside has been raised to thirtyfive spread over Australia New Zealand
and Tasmania Twentyseven assemblies are functioning in Latin America In
over a hundred localities BahAaAs are resident in Central and South
America almost double the localities at opening of the first Seven Year
Plan Historic Latin American conferences have been held in Buenos Aires
and Panama Summer schools are established in Argentina and Chile Land
has been offered in Chile for site of the first MashriqualAdhkAr of
Latin America Additional assemblies have been incorporated in Paraguay
and Colombia Seven others are in process of incorporation A notable
impetus has been lent this worldredeeming Message through the concerted
measures devised by the American National Assembly designed to proclaim
the Faith to the masses through public conferences press and radio
Such remarkable multiplication of dynamic institutions such thrilling
deployment of worldregenerating forces North South East and West
endow the preeminent goal of the Second Seven Year Plan in Europe with
extraordinary urgency and peculiar significance I am impelled to appeal
to all American believers possessing independent means to arise and
supplement the course of the second year of the Second Seven Year Plan
through personal participation or appointment of deputies the superb
exertions of the heroic vanguard of the hosts destined through successive
decades to achieve the spiritual conquest of the continent unconquered by
IslAm rightly regarded as the mother of Christendom the fountainhead of
American culture the mainspring of western civilization and the
recipient of the unique honor of two successive visits to its shores by
the Center of BahAauallAhas Covenant
April 28 1947
NSA MUST CONTROL CREDENTIALS OF FOREIGNERS
Owing to arrival of disloyal socalled BahAaAs your Assemblyas control of
credentials should be strictly exercised otherwise corruptive influences
will spread and injure the magnificent services being achieved by the
American BahAaA Community
Circa June 1947
THE CHALLENGING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PRESENT HOUR
The opening years of the second century of the BahAaA Era have
synchronized with the termination of the first epoch of the Formative Age
of the BahAaA Dispensation a Dispensation which posterity will recognize
as the most glorious and momentous in the greatest cycle in the worldas
religious history
The first seventyseven years of the preceding century constituting the
Apostolic and Heroic Age of our Faith fell into three distinct epochs of
nine of thirtynine and of twentynine yearsa duration associated
respectively with the BAbA Dispensation and the ministries of BahAauallAh
and of aAbdualBahA This Primitive Age of the BahAaA Era unapproached in
spiritual fecundity by any period associated with the mission of the
Founder of any previous Dispensation was impregnated from its inception
to its termination with the creative energies generated through the
advent of two independent Manifestations and the establishment of a
Covenant unique in the spiritual annals of mankind
The last twentythree years of that same century coincided with the first
epoch of the second the Iron and Formative Age of the Dispensation of
BahAauallAhathe first of a series of epochs which must precede the
inception of the last and Golden Age of that Dispensationaa Dispensation
which as the Author of the Faith has Himself categorically asserted must
extend over a period of no less than one thousand years and which will
constitute the first stage in a series of Dispensations to be established
by future Manifestations all deriving their inspiration from the Author
of the BahAaA Revelation and destined to last in their aggregate no
less than five thousand centuries
We are now entering the second epoch of the second Age of the first of
these Dispensations The first epoch witnessed the birth and the primary
stages in the erection of the framework of the Administrative Order of the
Faithathe nucleus and pattern of its World Orderaaccording to the precepts
laid down in aAbdualBahAas Will and Testament as well as the launching
of the initial phase of the worldencompassing Plan bequeathed by Him to
the American BahAaA Community That epoch was characterized by a twofold
process aiming at the consolidation of the administrative structure of the
Faith and the extension of the range of its institutions It witnessed on
the one hand the emergence and the laying of the groundwork of that
embryonic World Order whose advent was announced by the BAb in the BayAn
whose laws were revealed by BahAauallAh in the KitAbiAqdas and whose
features were delineated by aAbdualBahA in His Will and Testament It was
marked on the other hand by the launching in the Western Hemisphere of
the first stage of a Plan whose original impulse was communicated by the
Herald of our Faith in His QayyAomualAsmA to whose implications the
Author of the BahAaA Revelation alluded in His Tablets and whose Charter
was revealed by the Center of His Covenant in the evening of His life
The epoch we have now entered is destined to impart a great impetus to
this historic this twofold process It must witness on the one hand the
consummation of a laboriously constructed Administrative Order and on
the other the unfoldment of successive stages in the development of
aAbdualBahAas Plan beyond the confines of the Western Hemisphere and of
the continent of Europe
CROWNING FEATURE OF ADMINISTRATIVE ORDER THE UNIVERSAL HOUSE OF JUSTICE
During this Formative Age of the Faith and in the course of present and
succeeding epochs the last and crowning stage in the erection of the
framework of the Administrative Order of the Faith of BahAauallAhathe
election of the Universal House of Justiceawill have been completed the
KitAbiAqdas the MotherBook of His Revelation will have been codified
and its laws promulgated the Lesser Peace will have been established the
unity of mankind will have been achieved and its maturity attained the
Plan conceived by aAbdualBahA will have been executed the emancipation
of the Faith from the fetters of religious orthodoxy will have been
effected and its independent religious status will have been universally
recognized whilst in the course of the Golden Age destined to consummate
the Dispensation itself the banner of the Most Great Peace promised by
its Author will have been unfurled the World BahAaA Commonwealth will
have emerged in the plenitude of its power and splendor and the birth and
efflorescence of a world civilization the child of that Peace will have
conferred its inestimable blessings upon all mankind
FOURFOLD OBJECTIVE TO PRESENT REQUIREMENTS
Not ours however to unriddle the workings of a distant future or to
dwell upon the promised glories of a Godimpelled and unimaginably potent
Revelation Ours rather the task to cast our eyes upon and bend our
energies to meet the challenging requirements of the present hour
Labors of an urgent and sacred character claim insistently our undivided
attention during the opening years of this new epoch which we have
entered The Second Seven Year Plan intended to carry a stage further the
mission conceived by aAbdualBahA for the American BahAaA Community is
now entering its second year and must as it operates in three
continents be productive of results outshining any as yet achieved since
the Divine Plan itself was set in motion during the concluding years of
the first BahAaA century Unlike the plans which BahAaA communities in
Europe and on the Asiatic continent have spontaneously inaugurated since
the commencement of the present century the Plan with which the community
of the aApostles of BahAauallAha stands identified is divine in origin is
guided by the explicit and repeated instructions that have flowed from the
pen of the Center of the Covenant Himself is energized by the
allcompelling will of its Author claims as the theater for its operation
territories spread over five continents and the islands of the seven seas
and must continue to function ere its purpose is achieved throughout
successive epochs in the course of the Formative Age of the BahAaA
Dispensation As it propels itself forward driven by forces which its
prosecutors can not hope to properly assess as it spreads its
ramifications to the furthest corners of the Western Hemisphere and
across the oceans to the continents of the Old World and beyond them to
the farflung islands of the seas this Plan the birthright of the North
American BahAaA Community will be increasingly regarded as an agency
designed not only for the enlargement of the limits of the Faith and the
multiplication of its institutions over the face of the planet but for
the acceleration of the construction and completion of the administrative
framework of BahAauallAhas embryonic World Order hastening thereby the
advent of that Golden Age which must witness the proclamation of the Most
Great Peace and the unfoldment of that world civilization which is the
offspring and primary purpose of that Peace
The fourfold objective which the prosecutors of the Plan in the present
early stage of its development are now pursuing and which is designed to
stimulate the dual process initiated during the opening phase of the
Formative Age of the Faith must be strenuously and unfalteringly pursued
The second year of the Second Seven Year Plan must witness on all fronts
on the part of young and old alike rich and poor colored and white
neophyte and veteran a rededication to the tasks undertaken and an
intensification of effort for their furtherance wholly unparalleled in the
annals of American BahAaA history In every state of the United States in
every province of the Dominion of Canada in every republic of Central and
South America in each of the ten selected sovereign states of the
European continent the everswelling legions of BahAauallAhas steadily
advancing army obeying the Mandate of aAbdualBahA launched on the
second stage of their worldwide crusade deriving fresh courage from the
exploits that have distinguished the opening phase of the present stage of
their enterprise must strain every nerve to scale loftier heights of
heroism and deploy over a wider range their divinely sustained forces
as their present Plan unfolds and moves towards a climax
GOALS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ALASKA
In the United States of America the base from which the manifold
operations of this holy expedition are conducted the enterprise
associated with the completion of the first MashriqualAdhkAr of the
West designed to consummate this historic undertaking in time for the
celebration of its Jubilee in the year 1953 must be strenuously pushed
forward The prodigious efforts exerted for the erection of this noble
edificeathe holiest House of Worship ever to be reared by the followers of
BahAauallAhaon which no less than one million four hundred thousand
dollars have thus far been expended and which will necessitate the
expenditure of at least half a million more dollars ere it is completed
must not for one moment be relaxed The necessary modifications of the
design chosen for its interior ornamentation should be adopted the plans
and specifications prepared the preliminary contracts for its execution
placed and actual construction work started if possible ere the expiry
of the present year
The utmost effort by the National Teaching Committee and its auxiliary
Regional Teaching Committees aimed at raising the number of spiritual
assemblies in the North American continent to no less than one hundred and
seventyfive ere the expiry of the current year should be exerted The
eighty cities newly opened to the Faith should likewise be reinforced
The two hundred and eighteen groups already constituted should be
continually encouraged to evolve into assemblies while the vast number of
localities totalling over nine hundred where isolated believers reside
should however tremendous the exertion required be enabled to attain
group status and be eventually converted into properly functioning
assemblies
Collateral to this process of reinforcing the fabrics of the
Administrative Order and of widening its basis a resolute attempt should
be made by the national elected representatives of the entire community
aided by their Public Relations Race Unity Public Meetings Visual
Education College Speakers Bureau and Radio Committees to reinforce the
measures already adopted for the proclamation through the press and
radio of the verities of the Faith to the masses and for the
establishment of closer contact with the leaders of public thought with
colleges and universities and with newspaper and magazine editors
National advertising and publicity should be further developed the
contact with seven hundred and fifty newspapers magazines and trade
papers should be maintained and the public relations programs amplified
Association as distinct from affiliation and untainted by any
participation in political matters with the various organs leaders and
representatives of the United Nations and kindred organizations should be
stimulated for the purpose of giving on the one hand greater publicity
to the aims and purposes of the Faith and of paving the way on the
other for the eventual conversion of a selected number of capable and
receptive souls who will reinforce the ranks of its active and unreserved
supporters
The process of the incorporation of properly functioning spiritual
assemblies must be simultaneously and vigorously carried out The
fortyfive assemblies now incorporated are the first fruits of an
enterprise of great significance which must rapidly develop in the days
to come as an essential preliminary to the establishment and the
extension of the scope of BahAaA local endowments as soon as the
financial obligations incurred in connection with the completion of the
Temple have been discharged The institutions of the three summer schools
at Green Acre Davison and Geyserville and the International School at
Temerity Ranch as well as the activities of the BahAaA Youth must under
the close supervision of their respective national committees be
continually expanded and increasingly utilized as agencies for the
furtherance of the vital objectives of the Plan
The beneficial and highly responsible activities undertaken by the
Publishing the Reviewing the Library the Service for the Blind the
Visual Education the Pamphlet Literature and Study Aids Committees
designed to disseminate and insure the integrity of BahAaA literature
should however indirectly connected with the purposes of the Plan and
within the limits imposed upon them through its operation be steadily
expanded consolidated and be made to promote in whatever way possible
its paramount interests
Nor should the aspacious territory of Alaskaa particularly mentioned by
aAbdualBahA in His Tablets of the Divine Plan and at present the
northern outpost of the Faith in the Western Hemisphere be ignored or
its vital requirements neglected The maintenance and consolidation of the
first historic spiritual assembly in Anchorage the northernmost
administrative center of the Faith of BahAauallAh in the world the
multiplication of BahAaA centers in that territory the propagation of the
teachings among the Eskimos emphasized by aAbdualBahAas pen in those
same Tablets the translation and publication of selected passages from
BahAaA literature in their native language the extension of the limits of
the Faith beyond Fairbanks and nearer to the Arctic Circleathese
constitute the urgent tasks facing the prosecutors of the present Plan in
the years immediately ahead
aAlaska is a vast countrya are aAbdualBahAas own words recorded in
those Tablets aPerchance God willing the lights of the Most Great
Guidance will illuminate that country and the breezes of the rose garden
of the love of God will perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of Alaska
Should you be aided to render such a service rest ye assured that your
heads shall be crowned with the diadem of everlasting sovereigntya
CANADA TO FORM SEPARATE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
In the Dominion of Canada to whose significance and future the Author of
the Tablets of the Divine Plan has repeatedly referred and in all the
nine provinces of which as a direct result of the operation of the first
