A Model Steam Engine 1
The accompanying sketch illustrates a twocylinder singleacting
poppet valve steam engine of home construction
The entire engine excepting the flywheel shaft valve cams
pistons and bracing rods connecting the upper and lower plates of
the frame proper is of brass the other parts named being of cast
iron and bar steel
The cylinders G are of seamless brass tubing 112 in outside
diameter the pistons H are ordinary 112 in pipe caps turned
to a plug fit and ground into the cylinders with oil and emery
This operation also finishes the inside of the cylinders
The upright rods binding the top and bottom plates are of steel
rod about 18in in diameter threaded into the top plate and
passing through holes in the bottom plate with hexagonal brass
nuts beneath
The valves C and their seats B bored with a countersink bit
are plainly shown The valves were made by threading a copper
washer 38 in in diameter and screwing it on the end of the
valve rod then wiping on roughly a tapered mass of solder and
grinding it into the seats B with emery and oil
The valve rods operate in guides D made of 14in brass tubing
which passes through the top plate and into the heavy brass bar
containing the valve seats and steam passages at the top into
which they are plugfitted and soldered
The location and arrangement of the valve seats and steam passages
are shown in the sketch the flat bar containing them being
soldered to the top plate
The steam chest A over the valve mechanism is constructed of
Illustration Engine Details
1in square brass tubing one side being sawed out and the open
ends fitted with pieces of 116 in sheet brass and soldered in
The steam inlet is a gasoline pipe connection such as used on
automobiles
The valveoperating cams F are made of the metal ends of an old
typewriter platen one being finished to shape and then firmly
fastened face to face to the other and used as a pattern in
filing the other to shape Attachment to the shaft N is by means
of setscrews which pass through the sleeves
The main bearings M on the supports O and the crankend
bearings of the connecting rods K are split and held in position
by machine screws with provision for taking them up when worn
The exhausting of spent steam is accomplished by means of slots
I sawed into the fronts of the cylinders at about 18 in above
the lowest position of the pistons top at the end of the stroke
at which position of the piston the valve rod drops into the
cutout portion of the cam and allows the valve to seat
All the work on this engine save turning the pistons which was
done in a machine shop for a small sum and making the flywheel
this being taken from an old dismantled model was accomplished
with a hacksaw bench drill carborundum wheel files taps and
dies The base Q is made of a heavy piece of brass
The action is smooth and the speed high Steam is supplied by a
sheet brass boiler of about 3 pt capacity heated with a Bunsen
burner

Magic Spirit Hand 2
The magic hand made of wax is given to the audience for
examination also a board which is suspended by four pieces of
common pictureframe wire The hand is placed upon the board and
answers by rapping any question asked by members of the
audience The hand and the board may be examined at any time and
yet the rapping can be continued though surrounded by the
audience
The Magic Wand London gives the secret of this spirit hand as
follows The hand is prepared by concealing in the wrist a few
soft iron plates the wrist being afterwards bound with black
velvet as shown in Fig 1 The board is hollow the top being made
of thin veneer Fig 2 A small magnet A is connected to a
small flat pocket lamp battery B The board is suspended by four
lengths of pictureframe wire one of which E is
Illustration Wax Hand on Board and Electrical Connections
connected to the battery and another D to the magnet The other
wires F and G are only holding wires All the wires are fastened
to a small ornamental switch H which is fitted with a connecting
plug at the top The plug can be taken out or put in as desired
The top of the board must be made to open or slide off so that
when the battery is exhausted a new one can be installed
Everything must be firmly fixed to the board and the hollow space
filled in with wax which will make the board sound solid when
tapped
In presenting the trick the performer gives the hand and board
with wires and switch for examination keeping the plug concealed
in his right hand When receiving the board back the plug is
secretly pushed into the switch which is held in the right hand
The hand is then placed on the board over the magnet When the
performer wishes the hand to move he pushes the plug in which
turns on the current and causes the magnet to attract the iron in
the wrist and will therefore make the hand rap The switch can
be made similar to an ordinary push button so the rapping may be
easily controlled without detection by the audience
Making Skis and Toboggans 3
During the winter months everyone is thinking of skating coasting
or ski running and jumping Those too timid to run down a hill
standing upright on skis must take their pleasure in coasting or
skating
The ordinary ski can be made into a coasting skitoboggan by
joining two pairs together with bars without injury to their use
for running and jumping The ordinary factorymade skis cost from
250 per pair up but any boy can make an excellent pair far 50
cents
In making a pair of skis select two strips of Norway pine free
from knots 1 in thick 4 in wide and 7 or 8 ft long Try to
procure as fine and straight a grain as possible The pieces are
dressed thin at both ends leaving about 1 ft in the center the
full thickness of 1 in and gradually thinning to a scant 12 in
at the ends One end of each piece is tapered to a point beginning
12 in from the end A groove is cut on the under side about 14
in wide and 18 in deep and running almost the full length of
the ski This will make it track straight and tends to prevent
side slipping The shape of each piece for a ski as it appears
before bending is shown in Fig 1
The pointed end of each piece is placed in boiling water for at
least 1 hour after which the pieces are ready for bending The
bend is made on an ordinary stepladder The pointed ends are stuck
under the back of one step and the other end securely tied to the
ladder as shown in Fig 2 They should remain tied to the ladder
48 hours in a moderate temperature after which they will hold
their shape permanently
The two straps Fig 3 are nailed an a little forward of the
center of gravity so that when the foot is lifted the front

of the ski will be raised Tack on a piece of sheepskin or deer
hide where the foot rests Fig 4
The best finish for skis is boiled linseed oil After two or three

applications the under side will take a polish like glass from the
contact with the snow
The skitoboggan is made by placing two pairs of skis together
side by side

and fastening them with two bars across the top The bars are held
with Vshaped metal clips as shown in Fig 5

Homemade Life Preserver 4
Procure an inner tube of a bicycle tire the closedend kind and
fold it in four alternate sections as shown in Fig 1 Cut or
tear a piece of cloth into strips about 12 in wide and knot
them together Fasten this long strip of cloth to the folded tube
and weave it alternately in and out having each
Illustration Fig 1 Fig 2 Inner Tube and Cover
run of the cloth about 4 in apart until it is bound as shown in
Fig 1
Make a case of canvas that will snugly fit the folded tube when
inflated The straps that hold the preserver to the body may be
made of old suspender straps They are sewed to the case at one
end and fastened at the other with clasps such as used on overall
straps The tube can be easily inflated by blowing into the valve
at the same time holding the valve stem down with the teeth The
finished preserver is shown in Fig 2
How to Make Boomerangs 4
When the ice is too thin for skating and the snow is not right for
skis about the only thing to do is to stay in the house A
boomerang club will help to fill in between and also furnishes
good exercise for the muscles of the arm A boomerang can be made
Illustration Bending and Cutting the Wood
of a piece of well seasoned hickory plank The plank is well
steamed in a wash boiler or other large kettle and then bent to a
nice curve as shown in Fig 1 It is held in this curve until
dry with two pieces nailed on the sides as shown
After the piece is thoroughly dried out remove the side pieces
and cut it into sections with a saw as shown in Fig 2 The
pieces are then dressed round A piece of plank 12 in wide and 2
ft long will make six boomerangs
To throw a boomerang grasp it and hold the same as a club with
the hollow side away from you Practice first at some object about
25 ft distant and in a short time the thrower will be able to
hit the mark over 100 ft away Any worker in wood can turn out a
great number of boomerangs cheaply

How to Make an Eskimo Snow House 5
By GEORGE E WALSH
Playing in the snow can be raised to a fine art if boys and girls
will build their creations with some attempt at architectural
skill and not content themselves with mere rough work Working in
snow and ice opens a wide field for an expression of taste and
invention but the construction of houses and forts out of this
plastic material provides the greatest amount of pleasure to the
normally healthy boy or girl
The snow house of the Eskimo is probably the unhealthiest of
buildings made by any savage to live in but it makes an excellent
playhouse in winter and represents at the same time a most
ingenious employment of the arch system in building The Eskimos
build their snow houses without the aid of any scaffolding or
interior false work and while there is a keystone at the top of
the dome it is not essential to the support of the walls These
are selfsupporting from the time the first snow blocks are put
down until the last course is laid
The snow house is of the beehive shape and the ground plan is that
of a circle The circle is first laid out on the ground and a
space cleared for it Then a row of snow blocks is laid on the
ground and another course of similar blocks placed on top The
snow blocks are not exactly square in shape but about 12 in
long 6 in high and 4 or 5 in thick Larger or smaller blocks
can be used according to size of the house and thickness of the
walls
First the snow blocks must be packed and pressed firmly into
position out of moist snow that will pack A very light dry snow
will not pack easily and it may be necessary to use a little
water If the snow is of the right consistency there will be no
trouble in packing and working with it As most of the blocks are
to be of the same size throughout it will pay to make a mold for
them by forming a box of old boards nailed together minus the
top and with a movable bottom or rather no bottom at all Place
the four sided box on a flat board and ram snow in it forcing it
down closely Then by lifting the box up and tapping the box from
above the block will drop out In this way blocks of uniform size
are formed which makes the building simpler and easier
While one boy makes the blocks another can shave them off at the
edges and two others can build the house one inside of the circle
and the other outside The Eskimos build their snow houses in this
way and the man inside stays there until he is completely walled
in Then the door and a window are cut through the wall
Illustration Laying the Snow Bricks
Illustration ThreeRoom Snow House
Each layer of snow blocks must have a slight slant at the top
toward the center so that the walls will constantly curve inward
This slant at the top is obtained better by slicing off the lower
surfaces of each block before putting it in its course The top
will then have a uniform inward slant
The first course of the snow house should be thicker than the
others and the thickness of the walls gradually decreases toward
the top A wall however made of 6in blocks throughout will
hold up a snow house perfectly if its top is no more than 6 or 7
ft above the ground If a higher house is needed the walls should
be thicker at the base and well up toward the middle
The builder has no mortar for binding the blocks together and
therefore he must make his joints smooth and even and force in
loose snow to fill up the crevices A little experience will
enable one to do this work well and the construction of the house
will proceed rapidly The Eskimos build additions to their houses
by adding various domeshaped structures to one side and the
young architect can imitate them Such domeshaped structures are
shown in one of the illustrations
A fact not well understood and appreciated is that the Eskimo
beehive snow house represents true arch building It requires no
scaffolding in building and it exerts no outward thrust In the
ordinary keystone arch used by builders a temporary structure
must be erected to hold the walls up until the keystone is fitted
in position and the base must be buttressed against an outward
thrust The Eskimo does not have to consider these points There
is no outward thrust and the top keystone is not necessary to
hold the structure up It is doubtful whether such an arch could
be built of brick or stone without scaffolding but with the snow
blocks it is a simple matter
Secret Door Lock 6
The sketch shows the construction of a lock I have on a door which
is quite a mystery to those who do not know how it operates It
also keeps them out The parts of the lock on the inside of the
door are shown in Fig 1 These parts can be covered so that no
one can see them
Illustration Fig 1 Fig 2 Fig 3 The Lock Parts
The ordinary latch and catch A are attached to the door in the
usual manner The latch is lifted with a stick of wood B which is
about 1 ft long and 1 in wide and pivoted about twothirds of
the way from the top as shown The latch A is connected to the
stick B with a strong cord run through a staple to secure a
rightangle pull between the pieces A nail C keeps the stick B
from falling over to the left The piece of wood D is 6 or 8 in
long and attached to a bolt that runs through the door the
opposite end being fastened to the combination dial Two kinds of
dials are shown in Fig 2 The piece D is fastened on the bolt an
inch or two from the surface of the door to permit placing a
spiral spring of medium strength in between as shown in Fig 3
The opposite end of the bolt may be screwed into the dial which
can be made of wood or an old safe dial will do A nail is driven
through the outer end of the piece D and the end cut off so that
it will pass over the piece B when the dial is turned When the
dial is pulled out slightly and then turned toward the right the
nail will catch on the piece B and open the latch Contributed

A Convenient HotDish Holder 7
When taking hot dishes from the stove it is very convenient to
have holders handy for use For this purpose I screwed two screw
eyes into the ceiling one in front of the stove directly above
the place where the holder should hang and the other back of the
stove and out of the way I next ran a strong cord through the two
eyes To one end of the cord I attached a weight made of a clean
lump of coal The cord is just long enough to let the weight hang
a few inches above the floor and pass through both screw eyes I
fastened a small ring to the other end to keep the cord from
slipping back by the pull of the weight I then fastened two
pieces of string to the ring at the end of the cord and attached
an iron holder to the end of each string The strings should be
just long enough to keep the holders just over the stove where
they are always

MagicBox Escape 7
The things required to make this trick are a heavy packing box
with cover one pair of special hinges one or two hasps for as
many padlocks and a small buttonhook says the Sphinx
The hinges must be the kind for attaching inside of the box If
ordinary butts are used the cover of the box
Illustration Box with Hinges and Lock
must be cut as much short as the thickness of the end board The
hinges should have pins that will slip easily through the parts
Before entering the box the performer conceals the buttonhook on
his person and as soon as the cover is closed and locked and the
box placed in a cabinet or behind a screen he pushes the pin or
bolt of the hinge out far enough to engage the knob end with the
buttonhook which is used to pull the pin from the hinge Both
hinges are treated in this manner and the cover pushed up
allowing the performer to get out and unlock the padlocks with a
duplicate key The bolts are replaced in the hinges the box
locked and the performer steps out in view
A Flour Sifter 7
When sifting flour in an ordinary sieve I hasten the process and
avoid the disagreeable necessity of keeping my hands in the flour
by taking the top from a small tin lard can and placing it on top
of the flour with its sharp edges down When the sieve is shaken
the can top will round up the flour and press it through quickly

How to Make Comer Pieces for a Blotter Pad 8
To protect the corners of blotting pads such as will be found on
almost every writing desk proceed as follows
First make a design of a size proportionate to the size of the
pad and make a rightangled triangle as shown in Fig 1 on
drawing paper Leave a small margin all around the edge and then
place some decorative form therein Make allowance for flaps on
two sides as shown which may later be turned back and folded
under when the metal is worked It should be noted that the
corners of the design are to be clipped slightly Also note the
slight overrun at the top with the resulting Vshaped indentation
To make a design similar to the one shown draw onehalf of it
then fold along the center line and rub the back of the paper with
a knife handle or some other hard smooth surface and the other
half of the design will be traced on the second side With the
metal shears cut out four pieces of copper or brass of No 22
gauge and with carbon paper trace the shape and decorative design
on the metal Then cut out the outline and file the edges smooth
Cover the metal over with two coats of black asphaltum varnish
allowing each coat time to dry Cover the back and all the face
except the white background Immerse in a solution of 3 parts
water 1 part nitric acid and 1 part sulphuric acid When the
metal has been etched to the desired depth about 132 of an inch
remove it and clean off the asphaltum with turpentine Use a stick
with a rag tied on the end for this purpose so as to keep the
solution off the hands and clothes The four pieces should be
worked at the same time one for each corner
It remains to bend the flaps Place the piece in a vise as shown
in Fig 2 and bend the flap sharply to a right angle Next place
a piece of metal of a thickness equal to that of the blotter pad
at the bend and with the mallet bring the flap down parallel to
the face of the corner piece Fig 3 If the measuring has been
done properly the flaps
Illustration Manner of Forming the Plates
ought to meet snugly at the corner If they do not it may be
necessary to bend them back and either remove some metal with the
shears or to work the metal over farther All the edges should be
left smooth a metal file and emery paper being used for this
purpose
If a touch of color is desired it may be had by filling the
etched parts with enamel tinted by the addition of oil colors
such as are used for enameling bathtubs After this has dried
smooth it off with pumice stone and water To keep the metal from
tarnishing cover it with bananaoil lacquer
Boring Holes in Cork 8
The following hints will be found useful when boring holes in
cork In boring through rubber corks a little household ammonia
applied to the bit enables one to make a much smoother hole and
one that is nearly the same size at both openings The common
cork if rolled under the shoe sole can be punctured easily and a
hole can be bored straighter The boring is made easier by boiling
the cork and this operation insures a hole that will he the
desired size and remain the size of the punch or bit used
SelfLighting Arc Searchlight 9
A practical and easily constructed selflighting arc searchlight
can be made in the following manner Procure a large can about 6
in in diameter and cut three holes in its side about 2 in from
the back end and in the positions shown in the sketch Two of the
holes are cut large enough to hold a short section of a garden
hose tightly as shown at AA A piece of porcelain tube B used
for insulation is fitted tightly in the third hole The hose
insulation A should hold the carbon F rigidly while the carbon E
should rest loosely in its insulation
The inner end of the carbon E is supported by a piece of No 25
Germansilver wire C which is about 6 in long This wire runs
through the
Illustration Arc in a Large Can
porcelain tube to the binding post D The binding post is fastened
to a wood plug in the end of the tube The tube B is adjusted so
that the end of the carbon E is pressing against the carbon F The
electric wires are connected to the carbon F and the binding post
D A resistance R should be in the line
The current in passing through the lamp heats the strip of
Germansilver wire causing it to expand This expansion lowers
the end of the carbon E separating the points of the two carbons
and thus providing a space between them for the formation of an
arc When the current is turned off the Germansilver wire
contracts and draws the two carbon ends together ready for
lighting again The feed can be adjusted by sliding the carbon F
through its insulation
A resistance for the arc may be made by running the current
through a water rheostat or through 15 ft of No 25 gauge
Germansilver wire

A Travelers Shaving Mug 9
Take an ordinary collapsible drinking cup and place a cake of
shaving soap in the bottom ring This will provide a shaving mug
always ready for the traveler and one that will occupy very little
space in the grip
Homemade Snowshoes 9
Secure four light barrel staves and sandpaper the outside smooth
Take two old shoes that are extra large and cut off the tops and
heels so as to leave only the toe covering fastened to the sole
Purchase two long book straps cut them in two in the middle and
fasten the ends on the toe covering as shown in Fig 1 The
straps are used to attach the snowshoe to the regular shoe When
buckling up the straps be sure to leave them loose enough for the
foot to work freely Fig 2 Fasten the barrel staves in pairs
leaving a space of 4 in between them as shown in Fig 3 with
thin strips of wood Nail the old shoe soles to crosspieces

Fish Signal for Fishing through Ice 10
Watching a fish line set in a hole cut in the ice on a cold day is
very disagreeable and the usual method is to
Illustration Bell and Battery in a Box
have some kind of a device to signal the fisherman when a fish is
hooked The tip ups and the jumping jacks serve their purpose
nicely but a more elaborate device is the electric signal A
complete electric outfit can be installed in a box and carried as
conveniently as tackle
An ordinary electric bell A Fig 1 having a gong 212 in in
diameter and a pocket battery B are mounted on the bottom of the
box The electric connection to the bell is plainly shown Two
strips of brass C are mounted on the outside of the box The
brass strips are shaped in such a way as to form a circuit when
the ends are pulled together The box is opened and set on the ice
near the fishing hole The fish line is hung over a round stick
placed across the hole and then tied to the inside strip of brass
When the fish is hooked the line will pull the brass points into
contact and close the electric circuit
Homemade Floor Polisher 10
A floor polisher is something that one does not use but two or
three times a year Manufactured polishers come in two sizes one
weighing 15 lb which is the right weight for family use and one
weighing 25 lb
A polisher can be made at home that will do the work just as well
Procure a wooden box such as cocoa tins or starch packages are
shipped in and stretch several thicknesses of flannel or carpet
over the bottom allowing the edges to extend well up the sides
and tack smoothly Make a handle of two stout strips of wood 36
in long by joining their upper ends to a shorter crosspiece and
nail it to the box Place three paving bricks inside of the box
and the polisher will weigh about 16 lb just the right weight
for a woman to use The polisher is used by rubbing with the grain
of the wood

Homemade Scroll Saw 11
A scroll saw if once used becomes indispensable in any home
carpenter chest yet it is safe to say that not one in ten
contains it A scroll saw is much more useful than a keyhole saw
for sawing small and irregular holes and many fancy knickknacks
such as brackets bookracks and shelves can be made with one
A simple yet serviceable scroll saw frame can be made from a piece
of coldrolled steel rod 332 or 14 in in diameter two 18in
machine screws four washers and four square nuts The rod should
be 36 or 38 in long bent as shown in Fig 1 Place one washer on
each screw and put the screws through the eyelets AA then place
other washers on and fasten in place by screwing one nut on each
screw clamping the washers against the frame as tightly as
possible The saw which can be purchased at a local hardware
