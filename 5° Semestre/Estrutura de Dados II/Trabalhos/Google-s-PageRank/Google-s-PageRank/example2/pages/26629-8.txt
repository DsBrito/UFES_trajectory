WERWOLVES
CHAPTER I
WHAT IS A WERWOLF
What is a werwolf To this there is no one very satisfactory reply
There are indeed so many diverse views held with regard to the nature
and classification of werwolves their existence is so keenly disputed
and the subject is capable of being regarded from so many standpoints
that any attempt at definition in a restricted sense would be wellnigh
impossible
The word werwolf or werewolf is derived from the AngloSaxon wer
man and wulf wolf and has its equivalents in the German Wahrwolf
and French loupgarou whilst it is also to be found in the languages
respectively of Scandinavia Russia AustriaHungary the Balkan
Peninsula and of certain of the countries of Asia and Africa from
which it may be concluded that its range is pretty well universal
Indeed there is scarcely a country in the world in which belief in a
werwolf or in some other form of lycanthropy has not once existed
though it may have ceased to exist now But whereas in some countries
the werwolf is considered wholly physical in others it is looked upon
as partly if not entirely superphysical And whilst in some countries
it is restricted to the male sex in others it is confined to the
female and again in others it is to be met with in both sexes
Hence when asked to describe a werwolf or what is generally
believed to be a werwolf one can only say that a werwolf is an
anomalysometimes man sometimes woman or in the guise of man or
woman sometimes adult sometimes child or in the guise of
suchthat under certain conditions possesses the property of
metamorphosing into a wolf the change being either temporary or
permanent
This perhaps expresses most of what is general concerning werwolves
For more particular features upon which I will touch later one must
look to locality and time
Those who are sceptical with regard to the existence of the werwolf and
refuse to accept as proof of such existence the accumulated testimony
of centuries attribute the origin of the belief in the phenomenon
merely to an insane delusion which by reason of its novelty gained a
footing and attracted followers
Humanity they say has ever been the same and any fresh ideano
matter how bizarre or monstrous so long as it is monstrous enoughhas
always met with support and won credence
In favour of this argument it is pointed out that in many of the cases
of persons accused of werwolfery tried in France and elsewhere in the
middle of the sixteenth century when belief in this species of
lycanthropy was at its zenith there was an extraordinary readiness
among the accused to confess and even to give circumstantial evidence
of their own metamorphosis and that this particular form of
selfaccusation at length became so popular among the leading people in
the land that the judicial court having its suspicions awakened and
doubtless fearful of sentencing so many important personages acquitted
the majority of the accused announcing them to be the victims of
delusion and hysteria
Now if it were admitted argue these sceptics that the bulk of
socalled werwolves were impostors is it not reasonable to suppose that
all socalled werwolves were either voluntary or involuntary
impostorsthe latter ie those who were not selfaccused being
falsely accused by persons whose motive for so doing was revenge For
parallel cases one has only to refer to the trials for sorcery and
witchcraft in England And with regard to false accusations of
lycanthropyaccusations founded entirely on hatred of the accused
personhow easy it was to trump up testimony and get the accused
convicted The witnesses were rarely if ever subjected to a searching
examination the court was always biased and a confession of guilt
when not voluntaryas in the case of the prominent citizen when it was
invariably pronounced due to hysteria or delusioncould always be
obtained by means of torture though a confession thus obtained
needless to say is completely nullified Moreover we have no record of
metamorphosis taking place in court or before witnesses chosen for
their impartiality On the contrary the alleged transmutations always
occurred in obscure places and in the presence of people who one has
reason to believe were both hysterical and imaginative and therefore
predisposed to see wonders So says this order of sceptic and to my
mind he says a great deal more than his facts justify for although
contemporary writers generally are agreed that a large percentage of
those people who voluntarily confessed they were werwolves were mere
dissemblers there is no recorded conclusive testimony to show that all
such selfaccused persons were shams and delusionaries Besides even
if such testimony were forthcoming it would in nowise preclude the
existence of the werwolf
Nor does the fact that all the accused persons submitted to the rack or
other modes of torture confessed themselves werwolves prove that all
such confessions were false
Granted also that some of the charges of lycanthropy were groundless
being based on malicewhich by the by is no argument for the
nonexistence of lycanthropy since it is acknowledged that accusations
of all sorts having been based on malice have been equally
groundlessthere is nothing in the nature of written evidence that
would justify one in assuming that all such charges were traceable to
the same cause ie a malicious agency Neither can one dismiss the
testimony of those who swore they were actual eyewitnesses of
metamorphoses on the mere assumption that all such witnesses were
liable to hallucination or hysteria or were hyperimaginative
Testimony to an event having taken place must be regarded as positive
evidence of such an occurrence until it can be satisfactorily proved to
be otherwiseand this is where the case of the sceptic breaks down he
can only offer assumption not proof
Another view advanced by those who discredit werwolves is that belief
in the existence of such an anomaly originates in the impression made
on man in early times by the great elemental powers of nature It was
they say mans contemplation of the changes of these great elemental
powers of nature ie the changes of the sun and moon wind thunder
and lightning of the day and night sunshine and rain of the seasons
and of life and death and his deductions therefrom that led to his
belief in and worship of gods that could assume varying shapes such
for example as India who occasionally took the form of a bull
Derketo who sometimes metamorphosed into a fish Poseidon Jupiter
Ammon Milosh Kobilitch Minerva and countless othersand that it is
to this particular belief and worship which is to be found in the
mythology of every race that all religions as well as belief in
fairies demons werwolves and phantasms may be traced
Well this might be so if there were not in my opinion sufficient
accumulative corroborative evidence to show that not only were there
such anomalies as werwolves formerly but that in certain restricted
areas they are even yet to be encountered
Taking then the actual existence of werwolves to be an established
fact it is of course just as impossible to state their origin as it
is to state the origin of any other extraordinary form of creation
Every religious creed every Occult sect advances its own respective
viewsand has a perfect right to do so as long as it advances them as
views and not dogmatisms
I for my part bearing in mind that everything appertaining to the
creation of man and the universe is a profound mystery cannot see the
object on the part of religionists and scientists in being arbitrary
with regard to a subject which any child of ten will apprehend to be one
whereon it is futile to do other than theorize My own theory or rather
one of my own theories is that the property of transmutation ie
the power of assuming any animal guise was one of the many
propertiesincluding second sight the property of becoming invisible
at will of divining the presence of water metals the advent of death
and of projecting the etherical bodywhich were bestowed on man at the
time of his creation and that although mankind in general is no longer
possessed of them a few of these properties are still in a lesser
degree to be found among those of us who are termed psychic
The history of the Jews is full of references to certain of these
properties The greatest of all the Superphysical Forcesthe creating
Force the Hebrew Jah Jehovahso says the Bible constantly held
direct communication with His electwith Adam Noah Abraham and
Moses while His emissaries the angels or what modern Occultists would
term Benevolent Elementals conversed with Abraham Sarah Jacob and
hosts of others In this same history too there is no lack of
reference to sorcery and whilst Black Magic is illustrated in the
tricks wrought by the magicians before Pharaoh and the infliction of
all manner of plagues upon the Egyptians one is rather inclined to
attribute to White Magic Daniels safety among the lions Shadrach
Meshach and Abednegos preservation from the flames Elijahs
miraculous spinning out of the barrel of meal and cruse of oil in the
days of famine and his raising of the widows son Also to the account
of White Magicand should anyone dispute this point let me remind him
that it is merely a difference in the point of viewI would add
Elishas calling up of the bears that made such short work of the
naughty children who tormented him There are too many examples of
divination recorded in the Bible In Genesis chapter xxx verses
2743 a description is given of a divining rod and its influence over
sheep and other animals in Exodus chapter xvii verse 15 Moses with
the aid of a rod discovers water in the rock at Rephidim and for
similar instances one has only to refer to Exodus chapter xiv verse
16 and chapter xvii verses 911 The calling up of the phantasm of
Samuel at Endor more than suggests a biblical precedent for the modern
practice of spiritualism and it was undoubtedly the abuse of such
power as that possessed by the witch of Endor and the prevalence of
sorcery such as she practised that finally led to the decree delivered
by Moses to the Children of Israel that on no account were they to
suffer a witch to live Reference to yet another property of the
occultnamely Etherical Projectionwhich is clearly exemplified in
the Scriptures may be found in Numbers chapter xii verse 6 in Job
chapter xxxiii verse 15 in the First Book of Kings chapter iii
verse 5 in Genesis chapter xx verses 3 and 6 and chapter xxxi
verse 24 in Isaiah Jeremiah Nahum and Zechariah and more
particularly in the Acts of the Apostles and in the Revelation of St
John Lastly in this history of the Jews which is surely neither more
nor less authenticated than any other well established history
testimony as to the existence of one species of Elemental of much the
same order as the werwolf is recorded by Isaiah In chapter xiii verse
21 we read And their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and
owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there Satyrs we
repeat are not satyrs every whit as grotesque and outrageous as
werwolves Why then should those who regarding the Scriptures as
infallible confess to a belief in the satyr reject the possibility of
a werwolf And for those who are more logically scepticalwho question
the veracity of the Bible and are dubious as to its authenticitythere
are the chronicles of Herodotus Petronius Arbiter Baronius Dole
Olaus Magnus Marie de France Thomas Aquinas Richard Verstegan and
many other recognized historians and classics covering a large area in
the history of man all of whom specially testify to the existencein
their own respective periodsof werwolves
And if any further evidence of this once near relationship with the
Other World is required one has only to turn to Aristotle who wrote so
voluminously on psychic dreams most of which I am inclined to think
were due to projection to the teachings of Pythagoras and his
followers Empedocles and Apollonius to Cicero and Tacitus to Virgil
who frequently talks of ghosts and seers of Tyana to Plato the
exponent of magic and to Plutarch whose works swarm with allusions to
Occultism of all kindsphantasms of the dead satyrs and numerous
other species of Elementals
I say then that in ages past before any of the artificialities
appertaining to our present mode of living were introduced when the
world was but thinly populated and there were vast regions of wild
wastes and silent forests the Known and Unknown walked hand in hand It
was seclusion of this kind the seclusion of nature that spirits loved
and it was in this seclusion they were always to be found whenever man
wanted to hold communication with them To such silent spotsto the
woods and wildernessesBuddha Mohammed the Hebrew Patriarchs and
Prophets all in their turn resorted to solicit the companionship of
benevolently disposed spirits to be tutored by them and in all
probability to receive from them additional powers To these wastes and
forests too went all those who wished to do ill There they communed
with the spirits of darkness ie demons or what are also termed
Vice Elementals and from the latter they acquiredpossibly in exchange
for some of their own vitality for spirits of this order are said to
have envied man his material bodytuition in sorcery and such
properties as second sight invisibility and lycanthropy
This property of lycanthropy or metamorphosing into a beast probably
dates back to mans creation It was I am inclined to believe
conferred on man at his creation by Malevolent Forces that were
antagonistic to mans progress and that these Malevolent Forces had a
large share in the creation of this universe is to my mind extremely
probable But however that may be I cannot believe that the creation
of man and the universe were due entirely to one Creatorthere are
assuredly too many inconsistencies in all we see around us to justify
belief in only one Creative Force The Creator who inspired man with
lovelove for his fellow beings and love of the beautifulcould not be
the same Creator who framed that irredeemably cruel principle observable
throughout nature ie the survival of the fittest the preying of
the stronger on the weakerof the tiger on the feebler beasts of the
jungle the eagle on the smaller birds of the air the wolf on the
sheep the shark on the poor defenceless fish and so on neither could
He be the Creator that deals in diseasesfoul and filthy diseases
common not only to all divisions of the human species but to
quadrupeds birds fish and even flora that brings into existence
cripples and idiots the blind the deaf and dumb and watches with
passive inertness the most acute sufferings not only of adults but of
sinless children and all manner of helpless animals No It is
impossible to conceive that such incompatibilities can be the work of
one Creator But supposing for the sake of argument we may admit the
possibility of only one Creator we cannot concede that this Creator is
at the same time both omnipotent and merciful My own belief which is
merely based on common sense and observation is that this earth was
created by many Forcesthat everything that makes for mans welfare is
due to Benevolent Forces and that everything that tends to his
detriment is due to antagonistic Malevolent Forces and that the
Malevolent Forces exist for the very simple reason that the Benevolent
Forces are not sufficiently powerful to destroy them
These Malevolent Forces thenthe originators of all evilcreated
werwolves and the property of lycanthropy becoming in many cases
hereditary there were families that could look back upon countless
generations possessed of it But lycanthropy did not remain in the
exclusive possession of a few families the bestowal of it continued
long after its original creation and I doubt if this bestowal has even
now become entirely a thing of the past There are still a few
regionsdesolate and isolated regions in Europe in Russia
Scandinavia and even France to say nothing of Asia Africa and
America Australasia and Polynesiawhich are unquestionably the haunts
of Vagrarians Barrowvians and other kinds of undesirable Elementals
and it is quite possible that through the agency of these spirits the
property of lycanthropy might be acquired by those who have learned in
solitude how to commune with them
I have already referred to the werwolf as an anomaly and for its
designation I do not think I could have chosen a more suitable term
Though its movements and actions are physicalfor what could be more
material than the act of devouring flesh and bloodthe actual process
of the metamorphosis savours of the superphysical whilst to still
further strengthen its relationship with the latter its appearance is
sometimes half man and half wolf which is certainly more than
suggestive of the semihuman and by no means uncommon type of Elemental
Its inconsistency too which is a striking characteristic of all
psychic phenomena is also suggestive of the superphysical and
there is certainly neither consistency as to the nature of the
metamorphosiswhich is sometimes brought about at will and sometimes
entirely controlled by the hour of day or by the seasonsnor as to the
outward form of the werwolf which is sometimes merely that of a wolf
and sometimes partly wolf and partly human nor as to its shape at the
moment of death when in some cases there is metamorphosis whilst in
other cases there is no metamorphosis Nor is this inconsistency only
characteristic of the movements actions and shape of the werwolf It
is also characteristic of it psychologically When the metamorphosis is
involuntary and is enforced by agencies over which the subject has no
control the werwolf though filled with all the passions characteristic
of a beast of prey when a wolf is not of necessity cruel and savage
when a human being that is to say before the transmutations take
place There are many instances of such werwolves being as people
affectionate and kindly disposed On the other hand in some cases of
involuntary metamorphosis and in the majority of cases of voluntary
metamorphosisthat is to say when the transmutation is compassed by
means of magicthe werwolf as a person is evilly disposed and as a
wolf shows a distinct blending of the beast with the passions subtle
ingenuity and reasoning powers of the human being From this it is
obvious then that the werwolf is a hybrid of the material and
immaterialof man and Elemental known and Unknown The latter term
does not of course meet with acceptance at the hands of the
Rationalists who profess to believe that all phenomena can be explained
by perfectly natural causes They suggest that belief in the werwolf as
indeed in all other forms of lycanthropy is traceable to the craving
for blood which is innate in certain natures and is sometimes
accompanied by hallucination the subject genuinely believing himself to
be a wolf or whatever beast of prey is most common in the district
and in imitation of that animals habits committing acts of
devastation at night selecting his victims principally from among women
and childrenthose in fact who are too feeble to resist him
Often however say these Rationalists there is no suggestion of
hallucination the question resolving itself into one of vulgar
trickery The anthropophagi unable to suppress their appetite for human
food taking advantage of the general awe in which the wolf is held by
their neighbours dress themselves up in the skins of that beast and
prowling about lonely isolated spots at night pounce upon those people
they can most easily overpower Rumours most probably started by the
murderers themselves speedily get in circulation that the mangled and
halfeaten remains of the villagers are attributable to creatures half
human and half wolf that have been seen gliding about certain places
after dark The simple countryfolk among whom superstitions are rife
are only too ready to give credence to such reports the existence of
the monsters becomes an established thing whilst the localities that
harbour them are regarded with horror and looked upon as the happy
hunting ground of every imaginable occult power of evil
Now although such an explanation of werwolves might be applicable in
certain districts of West Africa where the native population is
excessively bloodthirsty and ignorant it could not for one moment be
applied to werwolfery in Germany France or Scandinavia where the
peasantry are generally speaking kindly and intelligent people whom
one could certainly accuse neither of being sanguinary nor of possessing
any natural taste for cannibalism
The rationalist view can therefore only be said to be feasible in
certain limited spheres outside of which it is grotesque and
ridiculous
Now a question that has occurred to me and which I fancy may give
rise to some interesting speculation is whether some of the werwolves
stated to have been seen may not have been some peculiar type of
phantasm I make this suggestion because I have seen several subhuman
and subanimal occult phenomena in England and have too met other
people who have had similar experiences
With our limited knowledge of the Unknown it is of course impossible
to be arbitrary as to the class of spirits to which such phenomena
belong They may be Vice Elementals ie spirits that have never
inhabited any material body whether human or animal and which are
wholly inimical to mans progresssuch spirits assume an infinite
number of shapes agreeable and otherwise or they may be phantasms of
dead human beingsvicious and carnalminded people idiots and
imbecile epileptics It is an old belief that the souls of cataleptic
and epileptic people during the bodys unconsciousness adjourned
temporarily to animals and it is therefore only in keeping with such a
view to suggest that on the deaths of such people their spirits take
permanently the form of animals This would account for the fact that
places where cataleptics and idiots have died are often haunted by semi
and by wholly animal types of phantasms
According to Paracelsus Man has in him two spiritsan animal spirit and
a human spiritand that in after life he appears in the shape of
whichever of these two spirits he has allowed to dominate him If for
example he has obeyed the spirit that prompts him to be sober and
temperate then his phantasm resembles a man but on the other hand if
he has given way to his carnal and bestial cravings then his phantasm
is earthbound in the guise of some terrifying and repellent
animalmaybe a wolf bear dog or catall of which shapes are far
from uncommon in psychic manifestations
This view has been held either in toto or with certain reservations
by many other writers on the subject and I too in a great measure
endorse itits pronouncement of a limit to mans phantasms being
perhaps the only important point to which I cannot accede My own view
is that so complex a creature as mancomplex both physically and
psychologicallymay have a representative spirit for each of his
personalities Hence on mans physical dissolution there may emanate
from him a host of phantasms each with a shape most fitting the
personality it represents And what more thoroughly representative of
cruelty savageness and treachery than a wolf or even something partly
lupine Therefore as I have suggested elsewhere in some instances but
emphatically not in all what were thought to have been werwolves may
only have been phantasms of the dead or Elementals
CHAPTER II
WERWOLF METAMORPHOSIS COMPARED WITH OTHER BRANCHES OF LYCANTHROPY
The wolf is not the only animal whose shape it is stated man may
possess the power of assuming and it may be of some interest to inquire
briefly into the varying branches of lycanthropy comparing them with
the one already under discussion
In Orissa the power of metamorphosing into a tiger is asserted by the
Kandhs to be hereditary and also to be acquired through the practice of
magic many who have travelled in this country have assured me that
there is a very great amount of truth in this assertion and that
although there are without doubt a number of impostors among those
designated wertigers there are most certainly many who are genuine
As with the werwolf so with the wertiger the metamorphosis is usually
dependent on the hour of the day and generally occurs cotemporaneous
with the setting of the sun
But the lycanthropy of the wertiger differs from that of the werwolf
inasmuch as there is a definite god or spirit in the shape of a tiger
that is directly responsible for the bestowal of the property This
tiger deity is looked upon and worshipped as a totem or national
deitythat is to say as a divine being that has the welfare of the
Kandh nation especially at heart It is communed with at home but more
particularly in the wild dreariness of the jungle where on the
condition that the prayers of its devotees are sufficiently concentrated
and in earnest it confersas an honour and privilegethe power of
transmutation into its own shape Some idea of its appearance may
perhaps be gathered from the following description of it given me by a
Mr K whose name I see in the list of passengers reported missing
in the deplorable disaster to the Titanic
Anxious to see Mr K stated if there was anything of truth in
the alleged materialization of the tiger totem to those supplicating it
I went one evening to a spot in the junglesome two or three miles from
the villagewhere I had been informed the manifestations took place As
the jungle was universally held to be haunted I met no one and in spite
of my dread of the snakes big cats wild boars scorpions and other
poisonous vermin with which the place was swarming arrived without
mishap at the place that had been so carefully described to mea
circular clearing of about twenty feet in diameter surrounded on all
sides by rank grass of a prodigious height trolsee shrubs kulpa and
tamarindtrees Quickly concealing myself I waited the coming of the
wouldbe tigerman
He was hardly more than a boyslim and almost feminineand came
gallivanting along the narrow path through the brushwood like some
careless highspirited brownskinned hoyden
The moment he reached the edge of the mystic circle however his
behaviour changed the light of laughter died from his eyes his lips
straightened his limbs stiffened and his whole demeanour became one of
respect and humility
Advancing with bare head and feet some three or so feet into the
clearing he knelt down and touching the ground three times in
succession with his forehead looked up at a giant kulpatree opposite
him chanting as he did so some weird and monotonous refrain the
meaning of which was unintelligible to me Up to then it had been
lightthe sky like all Indian skies at that season one blaze of
moonbeams and stars but now it gradually grew dark An unnatural
aweinspiring shade seemed to swoop down from the far distant mountains
and to hush into breathless silence everything it touched Not a bird
sang not an insect ticked not a leaf stirred One might have said all
nature slept had it not been for an uncomfortable sensation that the
silence was but the silence of intense expectationmerely the prelude
to some unpleasant revelation that was to follow At this juncture my
feelings were certainly novelentirely different from any I had
hitherto experienced
I had not believed in the supernatural and had had absolutely no
apprehensions of coming across anything of a ghostly characterall my
fears had been of malicious natives and tigers they now however
changed and I was confronted with a dread of what I could not
understand and could not analyseof something that suggested an
appearance alarming on account of its very vagueness
The pulsations of my heart became irregular I grew faint and sick and
painfully susceptible to a sensation of excessive coldness which
instinct told me was quite independent of any actual change in the
atmosphere
I made several attempts to remove my gaze from the kulpatree which
intuition told me would be the spot where the something whatever it
was that was going to happen would manifest itself My eyes however
refused to obey and I was obliged to keep them steadily fixed on this
spot which grew more and more gloomy All of a sudden the silence was
broken and a cry half human and half animal but horribly ominous
sounding at first faint and distant speedily grew louder and louder
Soon I heard footsteps the footsteps of something running towards us
and covering the ground with huge light strides Nearer and nearer it
came till with a sudden spring it burst into viewthe giant reeds
and trolsees were dashed aside and I saw standing in front of the
kulpatree a vertical column of crimson light of perhaps seven feet in
height and one or so in width A columnonly a column though the
suggestion conveyed to me by the column was nastynasty with a
nastiness that baffles description I looked at the native and the
expression in his eyes and mouth assured me he saw morea very great
deal more For some seconds he only gasped then by degrees the
rolling of his eyes and twitching of his lips ceased He stretched out a
hand and made some sign on the ground Then he produced a string of
beads and after placing it over the scratchings he had made on the
soil jerked out some strange incantation in a voice that thickened and
quivered with terror I then saw a stream of red light steal from the
base of the column and dart like forked lightning to the beads which
instantly shone a luminous red The native now picked them up and
putting them round his neck clapped the palms of his hands vigorously
together uttering as he did so a succession of shrill cries that
gradually became more and more animal in tone and finally ended in a
roar that converted every particle of blood in my veins into ice The
crimson colour now abruptly vanishedwhither it went I know notthe
shade that had been veiling the jungle was dissipated and in the burst
of brilliant moonlight that succeeded I saw peering up at me from the
spot where the native had lain the yellow glittering malevolent eyes
not of a man but a tigera tiger thirsting for human blood The shock
was so great that for a second or two I was paralysed and could only
stare back at the thing in fascinated helplessness Then a big bird
close at hand screeched and some small quadruped flew past me
terrified and with these awakenings of nature all my faculties revived
and I simply jumped on my feet andfled
Some fifty yards ahead of me and showing their tops well above the
moonkissed reeds and bushes were two treesa tamarind and a kulpa
briksha God knows why I decided on the latter Probably through a mere
fluke for I hadnt the remotest idea which of the trees offered the
best facilities to a poor climber My mind once made up there was no
time to alter The wertiger was already terribly close behind I could
gauge its distance by the patter of its feetapparently the
metamorphosis had only been in partand by the steadily intensifying
purr purr so unmistakably interpretative of the brutes utter
satisfaction in its power to overtake me as well as at the prospect of
so good a meal I was just thirteen stone seemingly a most unlucky
number even in weight Had the tiger wanted I am sure he could have
caught me at once but I fancy it wished to play with me a little
firstto let me think I was going to escape and then when it had got
all the amusement possible out of me just to give a little sprint and
haul me over Perhaps it was my anger at such undignified treatment of
the human race that gave a kind of sting to my running for I certainly
got over the ground at twice the speed I had ever done before or ever
thought myself capable of doing At times my limbs were on the verge of
mutiny but I forced them onward and though my lungs seemed bursting I
