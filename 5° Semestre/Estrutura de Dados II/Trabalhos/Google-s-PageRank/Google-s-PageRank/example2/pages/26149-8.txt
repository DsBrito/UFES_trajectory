CHAPTER I
THE BOY FROM KANSAS
HOLD up
Coach Robey coatless vestless hatless his old flannel trousers held
up as by a miracle with the aid of a leather strap scarcely deserving
the name of belt pushed his way through the first squad players The
Brimfield Head Coach was a wiry mediumsized man of about thirty with
a deeplytanned face from which sharp blue eyes looked out under whitish
lashes that were a shade lighter than his eyebrows and two shades
lighter than his sandy hair As the afternoon was excessively hot even
for the twentyfirst day of September and in proximity to Long Island
Sound Mr George Robeys countenance was bathed in perspiration and the
faded blue silk shirt was plastered to his body
That was left half through guardtackle wasnt it Then dont put the
ball in your arm St Clair You ought to know better than that On
plays through the line hold it against your stomach with both hands How
long do you think youd keep that ball in your elbow after you hit the
line Someone would knock it out in about one second Now try it again
and think what youre doing All right Carmine Same play
The panting and perspiring backs crouched once more Carmine shrilly
called his signals Thayer and Gafferty plunged against an imaginary foe
as Thursby shot the ball back and St Clair hugging the pigskin
ecstatically with widespread fingers trotted through the hole
stopped set the ball on the grass and wiped his streaming face with the
torn sleeve of a maroon jersey
All right said the coach That will do for today In on the trot
everyone
The first squad exhaling a long deep sigh of relief as one man set
their faces toward the gymnasium and trotted slowly off their
canvasclad legs swishswashing as they met Coach Robey walked
further down the sunbaked field to where the nearer of the remaining
four squads was at work
Oh put some pep into it McPhee called the coach as he approached
You all look as if you were asleep Come on now Wake up Jones get up
there Youre away out of position Thats better Now then Quarter
Hold up Whats your down
Third sir and four to go
All right Show me what youre going to do with it Head up Martin
Look where youre going
36274386 grunted the quarterback 36
Signal cried Gordon at right half
McPhee straightened cast a withering look at the halfback wiped the
perspiration from the end of his sunburnt nose and repeated
362743
Gordon shifted his feet and
Hold up barked the coach Gordon dont give the play away Shifting
your feet like that makes it a cinch for the other fellow Get your
position now and hold it until the balls passed All right Once more
Quarter
36274386 wailed McPhee 3627
The pigskin shot into his waiting hands Gordon leaped forward took it
at a handpass and ran out behind his line left half in advance turned
sharply in and set the ball down
First down called McPhee Sturges over
Hold up Try a forward pass McPhee Youre on the ten yards and its
third down Get into this you ends Put some pep into it
Signal Martin back 37321471Hep The backs jumped to the left
one stride 3732
Back flew the ball to the fullback right end shot out and down the
field across the mythical last line the defence surged against the
imaginary enemy and Martin poising the ball at arms length threw over
the line to Lee
All right commented the coach Thatll be all for today Trot all
the way in fellows
Five minutes later the field was empty of the sixtyodd boys who had
reported for the second days practice and the sun was going down behind
the treeclad hill to the west In the gymnasium was the sound of
rushing water of many voices and of scraping benches Mr Robey wormed
his way through the crowded lockerroom to where Danny Moore the
trainer stood in the doorway of the rubbingroom in talk with Jim
Morton this years manager of the team Morton was nineteen tall thin
and benevolent looking behind a pair of rubberrimmed spectacles
Did you put them on the scales Dan asked the coach
Sure the first second and third sir Some of em dropped a good
three pounds today By gorry I feel like Id dropped that much meself
It certainly is warm Look here Jim is this all we get to work on
How many were out today
Sixtytwo Coach Thats not bad I suppose therell be a few more
dribble along tomorrow and the next day
Well they look pretty fair dont you think Some of the new fellows
seem to have ideas of football All the last year fellows on hand
All but Gilbert He hasnt shown up I dont know why Im sure
Better look him up said the coach Gilbert ought to make a pretty
good showing this year and we arent any too strong on guards
Gilbert rooms with Tim Otis I think replied Morton Oh Tim Tim
Otis
A lighthaired boy of seventeen very straight and very pink where an
enormous bathtowel failed to cover him wormed his way to them
Say Tim whats the matter with Gilbert asked Morton Isnt he
coming out
Tim Otis shrugged a pair of broad lean shoulders He hasnt got here
yet Morton I dont know whats happened He wrote me two weeks ago
that hed meet me at the station in New York yesterday for the
threefiftyeight but he wasnt there and I havent heard a word from
him
Probably missed his connection suggested Morton He lives out West
somewhere doesnt he
Yes Osawatomie Kansas
It probably takes a good while to get away from a place with a name
like that said Mr Robey drily Well when he shows up Otis tell
him to get a move on if he wants a place
Yes sir I will Im pretty certain he will be along today some time
I wouldnt be surprised if he was here now
All right By the way Otis how do you feel at right half Seem
strange to you
No sir I dont notice it I did play right you know two years ago
on the second Seems to me its easier to take the ball from that
position too
Well dont try the fool trick your sidepartner did today said Mr
Robey smiling Putting the ball under your elbow for a line plunge is
a fine piece of business for a fellow whos been playing three years
Tim laughed I guess he did that because it was just practice sir He
knows a lot better than to do it in scrimmage
I hope so Well hurry Gilbert along will you If he doesnt get out
here inside of a few days he wont find much of a welcome Im afraid
Im not going to keep positions open for anyone this year not with the
first game coming along in four days
Dont you worry Mr Robey replied Tim with a chuckle and a flash of
white teeth Ill have him out here the first day he shows up even if
I have to lug him all the way Dont think Ill have to though for you
couldnt keep Don from playing football unless you tied him up
Nice chap commented Morton nodding at Tim as the latter returned to
his bench Awfully cleancut sort
A fine lad agreed Danny Moore and Mr Robey nodded thoughtfully
I dont believe were going to miss Kendall and Freer as much as I
thought he said after a moment Otis looks to me like a fellow who
will stand a lot of work and grow on it Well Im going to get a shower
and get out of this sweatbox As soon as you get time Jim I wish
youd catalogue the players the way we did last year and let me have
the list You know how Black did it dont you
Yes sir Ill have the list ready for you tomorrow
Good Got a towel I can use Dan I havent brought any yet Thanks
The coach nodded and sought a place to disrobe The trainers gaze
followed him until he was lost to sight beyond the throng
I wonder will he put it over again this year he mused
Surest thing you know asserted Morton Think Im going to have the
team licked the year Im manager Danny Not so youd notice it
Well between you and him chuckled Danny Ive no doubt youll turn
out a fine team Say hes the lad that can do it though now aint he
Four years hes been at it and its fiftyfifty now aint it
Yes we lost the first two years and won last year and the year before
It was Andy Millers team that started the ball rolling for us No one
could have won those first two years anyhow Danny Robey had to start
at the bottom and build up the whole thing We hadnt been playing
football here for several years before that It takes a couple of years
at the least to get a foundation laid If we win this year well have
something to boast of No other team ever beat Claflin three times
running
Maybe we wont either Im hoping we do though Still and all it
dont do to win too many times You get to thinking you cant lose dye
see and the first thing anyone knows youre all shot to pieces Ive
seen it happen me boy
Oh I dare say Danny but dont lets start the losing streak until
next year I want to manage a winning team Well so long See about
some cooler weather tomorrow will you
I will so replied the little trainer gravely Ill start
arrangements to once
Meanwhile Tim Otis again arrayed in grey flannels and a pair of tan
rubbersoled shoes rather the worse for a hard summer was on his way
along the Row to the last of the five buildings set end to end on the
brow of the hill As he swung in between Wendell and Torrencethe
gymnasium stood behind Wendell and save for the Cottage as the
principals residence was called was the only building out of
alignmenthe saw the entrances to dormitories and Main Hall thronged
with youths who evidently preferred the coolness of outdoors to the heat
of the rooms while others were seated on the grass along the walk It
almost seemed that the entire roster of some one hundred and eighty
students was before him He answered many hails but declined all
inducements to tarry keeping on his way past Main Hall and Hensey until
Billings was reached There he turned in and tramped to the right along
the first floor corridor to the open door of Number 6 a room on the
back of the building that looked out upon the tennis courts and beyond
the football and baseball fields From the fact that no sound came from
the room Tim decided that Don Gilbert had after all and in spite of
what Tim called a hunch failed to arrive But when he entered his
mistake was instantly apparent A marooncoloured cushion hurtled toward
him narrowly missing the green shade of the droplight on the study
table and thanks to prompt and instinctive action on the part of Tim
sailed on serene and unimpeded into the corridor Whereupon Tim
uttered a savage whoop of mingled joy and vengeance and traversing the
length of the room in four leaps hurled himself upon the occupant of
the windowseat
CHAPTER II
IN NUMBER SIX
FOR a long minute confusion and the noise of battle reigned supreme
Then in response to a sudden yelp of pain from Don Tim drew off
panting and grinning Don was extending a left hand funereally wrapped
in a black silk handkerchief further along the windowseat and away
from the scene of action
Hello said Tim Whats the matter with that
Hurt it a little replied Don
Well I supposed you had you idiot How Hit it against your head
The other smiled in his slow fashion We had a sort of a wreck coming
on Out in Indiana somewhere I got this Thats why Im behind time
Im beastly sorry old man I didnt notice the crepe Did I hurt it
much
No I yelled so you wouldnt Preparedness you know Safety first and
so on It isnt much Hows everything here
Tim seated himself at the other end of the seat took his knees in his
hands and beamed
Oh fine Say Im tickled to death to see your ugly mug again Don
You arent a bit handsomer are you
Ive been told I was Trouble with you is you dont recognise manly
beauty when you see it
Oh dont I Tim twirled an imaginary moustache I recognise it every
time I look in the glass Well how are you aside from the bum fist
Great Ive just had a seance with Josh I tried to register and sneak
by but Brooke wouldnt have it that way Er quite so Gilbert quite
so but Ierthink you had better see Mr Fernald So I did and Josh
read me the riot act Thought for awhile he was going to send me home
again
But didnt you tell him your train was wrecked
Yes but he didnt believe in it much Thought I was romancing I
guess Got a railway guide and showed me how I might have got here on
time just the same Maybe hes right but I couldnt figure it out in
Cincinnati Besides I didnt get away with much of anything besides
pajamas and overcoat and shoes and so I had to refit That lost me the
first connection and then I got held up again at Pittsburg So here I
am the late Mr Gilbert
Josh is an idiot said Tim disgustedly Didnt he see your hand How
did he think you did that if you werent in a wreck
Oh I kept that in my pocket and I guess he didnt notice it He came
around all right in the end though We parted friends At least I
did
Well what about that Tim nodded at the injured hand Howd you cut
you burn you
Yes Things got on fire
Youre the most vivid descriptionist I ever listened to Come across
with the sickening details How did it happen I didnt see anything
about it in the papers
Probably wasnt on the sporting page replied Don gravely
Oh dry up and blow away Wasnt it in the papers
Cincinnati papers had it I havent read the others It wasnt much of
a wreck really Engineer killed fireman scalded about twenty
passengers injured more or less Several considerably more Express
messenger expected to pass out Just a nice cosy little wreck with
nono spectacular features as you might say
Well come on How did it happen
Freight train taking a siding and went to sleep at it Our engine
bumped the other engine and they both went smash Hot coals and steam
and so on got busy It was about five in the morning Just getting
lightish Everyone snuggled up in bed Biff Wow I landed out on the
floor on my hands and knees Everyone yelled Car turned half over and
sat that way Doors got jammed We beat it out by the windows I was a
Roman Senator with a green berth curtain wrapped about me Afterwards I
sneaked back and pulled out my shoes and overcoat Always sleep with my
shoes under my pillow you see Good idea too If I hadnt had them
there Id never have got them Couldnt get my bag out Car was on fire
by that time Three others too They saved all but the one I was in and
the express and baggage cars After awhile a wrecking train came and
then a lot of us walked to a village about a mile and a half away and
had breakfast and went on to Cincinnati about noon
Gee But still you know I dont see how you got burned
Well things were pretty hot Some of them got burned a lot worse than
I did Had to pull some of them out the windows and through the roofs
Women too Lucky thing our car had only two in it Two women I mean
Things were fairly busy for awhile
Must have been The engineer was killed straight off eh
Ours was The other one managed to jump Firemen got off all right
too The other fireman Ours got caught and scalded like the dickens
Saw the engineer myself Don frowned and shuddered Nasty mess he was
too poor fellow Lets talk about something else I dont like to
remember that engineer
Too bad But say you were lucky werent you You might have been
killed I suppose
Might have maybe Didnt come very near it though First wreck I ever
saw and dont want to see any more Funny thing though I didnt mind
it at all until I was on the train going to Cincinnati Excitement I
suppose Then I came near keeling over honest What do you know about
that Timmy
I guess anyone would have How bad is your burn
Not bad Hurts a bit though Its the inside of the fingers and the
palm Itll be all right in a few days I guess Doctor chap said Id
have to have it dressed every day for awhile
But Great Scott Don what about football
Ive thought of that Nothing doing for a week or so I guess Rotten
luck eh
Beastly And Robey was telling me only half an hour ago to hurry you
up Said youd have to come right out if you wanted a place Still when
he understands what the trouble is
Ill see him tonight I guess Whos playing guard Tim
Joe Gafferty left Tom Hall right Walton and Pryme and Lawton are
all after places Waltons been doing good work too I think
All the fellows back
Every last one Remember Howard who played sub halfback for the
second last year Hes showing great form Still you cant tell much
yet Theres to be scrimmage tomorrow We play Thacher Saturday you
know Sort of quick work and I dont believe well be anywhere near
ready for them
Thachers easy We beat them 26 to 3 last year
Twentythree to three
Twentysix
Twentythree Bet you
I dont bet Timmy Know Im right though Anyway Thachers easy
Tell me the news
Oh there isnt anything startling We had the usual polite party at
Joshs last night Shook hands with the new chaps and told em how
tickled we were to see them Ate sandwiches and cake and lemonade
andby the way weve got a new master physics Moller his name is
Caleb Moller BA Quite a handsome brute and a swell dresser Comes
from Lehigh or one of those Southern colleges I believe
Lehighs in Pennsylvania you ignoramus
Is it answered Tim untroubledly All right Let it stay there
Anyhow Caleb is some cheese
Wheres Rollinson gone
Dont know what happened to Rollo Draper said he heard hed gone to
some whopping big prep school up in New Hampshire or somewhere
Or some other Southern school suggested Don soberly
Dry up And say get a move on Its nearly time for eats and Im
starved
Timmy I never saw the time you werent starved All right Im sort of
hungry myself Havent had anything since about ten oclock this
morning Ran out of money Got here with eight cents in my pocket That
and my tuition check Id have cashed that if I could have and had a
dinner I was sure hungry
Well wash your dirty face and hands said Tim and come along Oh
say Don wait till you see the classy Norfolk suit Ive got I enticed
dad into Crooks when we struck the city told him I had to have some
hankies and ties you know Then I steered him up against this here
suit and this here suit made a hit with him right away If he could
have got into it himself hed have walked out in it Its sort of green
with a reddish thread wandering carelessly through it Its some
apparel take it from me
Maybe I will if it fits me responded Don
Will what
Take it from you
Gee but youre bright Getting wreckeds put an edge on you sonny
Im afraid that suit wouldnt fit you though Don Youve grown about
an inch since Spring havent you Youre beastly fat too
I am not denied Don goodhumouredly indignant Ive kept in strict
training all summer What you think is fat is good hard muscle Timmy
Feel of that arm if you dont believe it
Yes quite villageblacksmithy
Quite what
Villageblacksmithy The muscles of his mighty arms were strong as
iron bands or something like that Get out of the way and let me wash
up
Don retired to his dresser and passed the brushes over his brown hair
and snugged his tie up a bit The face that looked back at him from the
mirror was not perhaps handsome although it by no means merited Tims
aspersions There was a nice pair of dark brown eyes rather slumberous
looking a nose a trifle too short for perfection and a mouth a shade
too wide But it was a goodtempered pleasant face on the whole
intelligent and capable and matching well the physically capable body
below a body of wide shoulders and wellknit muscles and a deep chest
that might have belonged to a youth of eighteen instead of seventeen
Compared with Tim Otis who was of the same age Don Gilbert suffered on
only two countsquickness and vivacity Tim wellmuscled possessed a
litheness that Don could never attain to and moved thought and spoke
far more quickly In height Don topped his friend by almost a full inch
and was broader and biggerboned They were both in spite of
dissimilarity fine manly fellows
Tim wiping his hands after ablutions turned to survey Don with a
quizzical smile on his goodlooking face And after a moments
reflective regard of his chums broad back he broke the silence
Say Don he asked glad to get back
Don turned while a slow smile crept over his countenance
Suure he drawled
CHAPTER III
AMY HOLDS FORTH
BRIMFIELD ACADEMY is at Brimfield and Brimfield is a scant thirty miles
out of New York City and some two or three miles from the Sound It is
more than possible that these facts are already known to you if you
live in the vicinity of New York they certainly are But at the risk of
being tiresome I must explain a little about the school for the benefit
of those readers who are unacquainted with it Brimfield was this Fall
entering on its twentyfifth year a fact destined to be appropriately
celebrated later on The enrollment was one hundred and eighty students
and the faculty consisted of twenty members inclusive of the principal
Mr Joshua L Fernald AM more familiarly known as Josh The course
covers six years and boys may enter the First Form at the age of
twelve Being an endowed institution and well supplied with money under
the terms of the will of its founder Brimfield boasts of its fine
buildings There are four dormitories Wendell Torrence Hensey and
Billings all modern and between Torrence and Hensey the original
Academy Building now known as Main Hall and containing the class rooms
school offices assembly room and library The dining hall is in
Wendell the last building on the right Behind Wendell is the
gymnasium Occupying almost if not quite as retiring a situation at the
other end of the Row is the Cottage Mr Fernalds residence Each
dormitory is ruled over by a master In Billings Mr Daley the
instructor in modern languages was in charge at the period of this
story and since it was necessary to receive permission before leaving
the school grounds after supper Don and Tim paused at Mr Daleys study
on the way out Dons knock on the portal of Number 8 elicited an
instant invitation to enter and a moment later he was shaking hands with
the hall master a youngish man with a pleasant countenance and a manner
at once eager and embarrassed Mr Daley was usually referred to as
Horace which was his first name and as he shook hands Don very
nearly committed the awful mistake of calling him that After greetings
had been exchanged Don explained somewhat vaguely the reason for his
tardy arrival and then requested permission to visit Coach Robey in the
village after supper
Yes Gilbert buterbe back by eight please Im not sure that Mr
Robey isnt about school however Have you inquired
No sir but Tim says he isnt eating in hall yet and so
Ah in that case perhaps not Well be back for study hour If youre
going to supper Ill walk along with you fellows Mr Daley closed his
study door and they went out together and as they trod the flags of the
long walk that passed the fronts of the buildings Mr Daley discoursed
on football with Tim while Don replied to the greetings of friends They
parted from the instructor at the dining hall door and sought their
places at table Dons arrival being greeted with acclaim by the other
halfdozen occupants of the board Once more he was obliged to give an
account of himself but this time his narrative was considered to be
sadly lacking in detail and it was not until Tim had come to his
assistance with a highly coloured if not exactly authentic history of
the trainwreck that the audience was satisfied Don told him he was an
idiot Tim declining to argue the point revenged himself by stealing a
slice of Dons bread when the latters attention was challenged by Harry
Westcott at the farther end of the table
Westcott who was one of the editors of the school monthly The
Review had developed the journalistic instinct to a high degree of
late and had visions of a thrilling story in the November issue But Don
utterly refused to pose as a hero of any sort The best Harry could get
out of him was the acknowledgment that he had seen several persons
removed from the wreck and had helped carry one to the relief train
later That wasnt much to go on and subsequently Harry regretfully
abandoned his plan
After supper Don and Tim walked down to the village and Don had a few
minutes of talk with the coach Mr Robey was sympathetic but annoyed
Although he didnt say so in so many words he gave Don to understand
that he had failed in his duty to the school and the team in allowing
himself to become concerned in a trainwreck He didnt explain just how
Don could have avoided it and Don didnt think it worth while to
inquire
You have that hand looked after properly and regularly Gilbert he
said and watch practice until you can put on togs Losing a week or so
is going to handicap you No doubt about that And Im not making any
promises But you keep your eyes open and maybe therell be a place for
you when youre ready to work Its awfully hard luck old chap See you
tomorrow
Don went back to school through the warm dusk slightly cast down
although he had previously realised that football would be beyond him
for at least a week It is sometimes one thing to acknowledge a fact
oneself and another to hear the same fact stated by a second person
Theres a certain finality about the latter that is convincing But if
Don was downcast he didnt show it to his companion Don had a way of
concealing his emotions that Tim at once admired and resented When Tim
felt bluewhich was mighty seldomhe let it be known to the whole
world and when he felt gay he was just as confiding But Donwell as
Tim often said he was worse than an Indian
After study they sallied forth again arm in arm and went down the Row
to Torrence and climbed the stairs to Number 14 As the door was half
open knocking was a needless formalityespecially as the noise within
would have prevented its being heardand so Tim pushed the portal
further ajar and entered followed by Don on a most animated scene
Eight boys were sprawled or seated around the room while another a
thin tall unkempt youth with a shock of very black hair which was
always falling over his eyes and being brushed aside was standing in a
small clearing between table and windows balancing a baseball bat
surmounted by two books and a glass of water on his chin So interested
was the audience in this startling feat that the presence of the new
arrivals passed unnoted until the juggler suddenly stepping back
allowed the law of gravity to have its way for an instant Then his
right hand caught the falling bat the two books crashed unheeded to the
floor and his left hand seized the descending tumbler Simultaneously
there was a disgruntled yelp from Jim Morton and a howl of laughter from
the rest of the audience For the juggler while he had miraculously
caught the tumbler in midair had not been deft enough to keep the
contents intact and about half of it had gone into the football
managers face However everyone there except Morton applauded
enthusiastically and hilariously and Larry Jones sweeping his
offending locks aside with the careless and impatient grace of a violin
virtuoso bowed repeatedly
Great stuff approved Amory Byrd rescuing his books from the floor
Do it again and stand nearer Jim
If he does it again Im going into the hall said Morton disgustedly
wiping his damp countenance on the edge of Clint Thayers bedspread
Youre a punk juggler Larry
All right you do it was the reply Larry proffered the bat and
tumbler but Morton waved them indignantly aside
I dont do monkeytricks thanks Gee my collars sopping wet
Oh thats all right called someone Youll be going to bed soon
