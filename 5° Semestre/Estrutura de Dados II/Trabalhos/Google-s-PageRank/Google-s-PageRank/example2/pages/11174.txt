THE STORY OF GEORGE WASHINGTON
IWHEN WASHINGTON WAS A BOY
When George Washington was a boy there was no United States The land
was here just as it is now stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the
Pacific but nearly all of it was wild and unknown
Between the Atlantic Ocean and the Alleghany Mountains there were
thirteen colonies or great settlements The most of the people who
lived in these colonies were English people or the children of English
people and so the King of England made their laws and appointed their
governors
The newest of the colonies was Georgia which was settled the year after
George Washington was born
The oldest colony was Virginia which had been settled one hundred and
twentyfive years It was also the richest colony and more people were
living in it than in any other
There were only two or three towns in Virginia at that time and they
were quite small
Most of the people lived on farms or on big plantations where they
raised whatever they needed to eat They also raised tobacco which they
sent to England to be sold
The farms or plantations were often far apart with stretches of thick
woods between them Nearly every one was close to a river or some other
large body of water for there are many rivers in Virginia
There were no roads such as we have nowadays but only paths through
the woods When people wanted to travel from place to place they had to
go on foot or on horseback or in small boats
A few of the rich men who lived on the big plantations had coaches and
now and then they would drive out in grand style behind four or six
horses with a fine array of servants and outriders following them But
they could not drive far where there were no roads and we can hardly
understand how they got any pleasure out of it
Nearly all the work on the plantations was done by slaves Ships had
been bringing negroes from Africa for more than a hundred years and now
nearly half the people in Virginia were blacks
Very often also poor white men from England were sold as slaves for a
few years in order to pay for their passage across the ocean When their
freedom was given to them they continued to work at whatever they could
find to do or they cleared small farms in the woods for themselves or
went farther to the west and became woodsmen and hunters
There was but very little money in Virginia at that time and indeed
there was not much use for it For what could be done with money where
there were no shops worth speaking of and no stores and nothing to
buy
The common people raised flax and wool and wove their own cloth and
they made their own tools and furniture The rich people did the same
but for their better or finer goods they sent to England
For you must know that in all this country there were no great mills for
spinning and weaving as there are now there were no factories of any
kind there were no foundries where iron could be melted and shaped into
all kinds of useful and beautiful things
When George Washington was a boy the world was not much like it is now
IIHIS HOMES
George Washingtons father owned a large plantation on the western shore
of the Potomac River Georges greatgrandfather John Washington had
settled upon it nearly eighty years before and there the family had
dwelt ever since
This plantation was in Westmoreland county not quite forty miles above
the place where the Potomac flows into Chesapeake Bay By looking at
your map of Virginia you will see that the river is very broad there
On one side of the plantation and flowing through it there was a
creek called Bridges Creek and for this reason the place was known as
the Bridges Creek Plantation
It was here on the 22d of February 1732 that George Washington was
born
Although his father was a rich man the house in which he lived was
neither very large nor very fineat least it would not be thought so
now
It was a square wooden building with four rooms on the ground floor
and an attic above
The eaves were low and the roof was long and sloping At each end of
the house there was a huge chimney and inside were big fireplaces one
for the kitchen and one for the great room where visitors were
received
But George did not live long in this house When he was about three
years old his father removed to another plantation which he owned near
Hunting Creek several miles farther up the river This new plantation
was at first known as the Washington Plantation but it is now called
Mount Vernon
Four years after this the house of the Washingtons was burned down But
Mr Washington had still other lands on the Rappahannock River He had
also an interest in some iron mines that were being opened there And so
to this place the family was now taken
The house by the Rappahannock was very much like the one at Bridges
Creek It stood on high ground overlooking the river and some low
meadows and on the other side of the river was the village of
Fredericksburg which at that time was a very small village indeed
George was now about seven years old
IIIHIS SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLMASTERS
There were no good schools in Virginia at that time In fact the people
did not care much about learning
There were few educated men besides the parsons and even some of the
parsons were very ignorant
It was the custom of some of the richest families to send their eldest
sons to England to the great schools there But it is doubtful if these
young men learned much about books
They spent a winter or two in the gay society of London and were taught
the manners of gentlemenand that was about all
George Washingtons father when a young man had spent some time at
Appleby School in England and Georges halfbrothers Lawrence and
Augustine who were several years older than he had been sent to the
same school
But booklearning was not thought to be of much use To know how to
manage the business of a plantation to be polite to ones equals to be
a leader in the affairs of the colonythis was thought to be the best
education
And so for most of the young men it was enough if they could read and
write a little and keep a few simple accounts As for the girls the
parson might give them a few lessons now and then and if they learned
good manners and could write letters to their friends what more could
they need
George Washingtons first teacher was a poor sexton whose name was Mr
Hobby There is a story that he had been too poor to pay his passage
from England and that he had therefore been sold to Mr Washington as
a slave for a short time but how true this is I cannot say
From Mr Hobby George learned to spell easy words and perhaps to write
a little but although he afterward became a very careful and good
penman he was a poor speller as long as he lived
When George was about eleven years old his father died We do not know
what his fathers intentions had been regarding him But possibly if he
had lived he would have given George the best education that his means
would afford
But now everything was changed The plantation at Hunting Creek and
indeed almost all the rest of Mr Washingtons great estate became the
property of the eldest son Lawrence
George was sent to Bridges Creek to live for a while with his brother
Augustine who now owned the old home plantation there The mother and
the younger children remained on the Rappahannock farm
While at Bridges Creek George was sent to school to a Mr Williams
who had lately come from England
There are still to be seen some exercises which the lad wrote at that
time There is also a little book called The Young Mans Companion
from which he copied with great care a set of rules for good behavior
and right living
Not many boys twelve years old would care for such a book nowadays But
you must know that in those days there were no books for children and
indeed very few for older people
The maxims and wise sayings which George copied were no doubt very
interesting to himso interesting that many of them were never
forgotten
There are many other things also in this Young Mans Companion and we
have reason to believe that George studied them all
There are short chapters on arithmetic and surveying rules for the
measuring of land and lumber and a set of forms for notes deeds and
other legal documents A knowledge of these things was doubtless of
greater importance to him than the reading of many books would have
been
Just what else George may have studied in Mr Williamss school I cannot
say But all this time he was growing to be a stout manly boy tall and
strong and wellbehaved And both his brothers and himself were
beginning to think of what he should do when he should become a man
IVGOING TO SEA
Once every summer a ship came up the river to the plantation and was
moored near the shore
It had come across the sea from faraway England and it brought many
things for those who were rich enough to pay for them
It brought bonnets and pretty dresses for Georges mother and sisters
it brought perhaps a hat and a tailormade suit for himself it brought
tools and furniture and once a yellow coach that had been made in
London for his brother
When all these things had been taken ashore the ship would hoist her
sails and go on farther up the river to leave goods at other
plantations
In a few weeks it would come back and be moored again at the same place
Then there was a busy time on shore The tobacco that had been raised
during the last year must be carried on shipboard to be taken to the
great tobacco markets in England
The slaves on the plantation were running back and forth rolling
barrels and carrying bales of tobacco down to the landing
Letters were written to friends in England and orders were made out for
the goods that were to be brought back next year
But in a day or two all this stir was over The sails were again
spread and the ship glided away on its long voyage across the sea
George had seen this ship coming and going every year since he could
remember He must have thought how pleasant it would be to sail away to
foreign lands and see the many wonderful things that are there
And then like many another active boy he began to grow tired of the
quiet life on the farm and wish that he might be a sailor
He was now about fourteen years old Since the death of his father his
mother had found it hard work with her five children to manage her
farm on the Rappahannock and make everything come out even at the end of
each year Was it not time that George should be earning something for
himself But what should he do
He wanted to go to sea His brother Lawrence and even his mother
thought that this might be the best thing
A bright boy like George would not long be a common sailor He would
soon make his way to a high place in the kings navy So at least his
friends believed
And so the matter was at last settled A seacaptain who was known to
the family agreed to take George with him He was to sail in a short
time
The day came His mother his brothers his sisters were all there to
bid him goodbye But in the meanwhile a letter had come to his mother
from his uncle who lived in England
If you care for the boys future said the letter do not let him go
to sea Places in the kings navy are not easy to obtain If he begins
as a sailor he will never be aught else
The letter convinced Georges motherit half convinced his
brothersthat this going to sea would be a sad mistake But George
like other boys of his age was headstrong He would not listen to
reason A sailor he would be
The ship was in the river waiting for him A boat had come to the
landing to take him on board
The little chest which held his clothing had been carried down to the
bank George was in high glee at the thought of going
Goodbye mother he said
He stood on the doorstep and looked back into the house He saw the kind
faces of those whom he loved He began to feel very sad at the thought
of leaving them
Goodbye George
He saw the tears welling up in his mothers eyes He saw them rolling
down her cheeks He knew now that she did not want him to go He could
not bear to see her grief
Mother I have changed my mind he said I will not be a sailor I
will not leave you
Then he turned to the black boy who was waiting by the door and said
Run down to the landing and tell them not to put the chest on board
Tell them that I have thought differently of the matter and that I am
going to stay at home
If George had not changed his mind but had really gone to sea how very
different the history of this country would have been
He now went to his studies with a better will than before and although
he read but few books he learned much that was useful to him in life He
studied surveying with especial care and made himself as thorough in
that branch of knowledge as it was possible to do with so few
advantages
VTHE YOUNG SURVEYOR
Lawrence Washington was about fourteen years older than his brother
George
As I have already said he had been to England and had spent sometime at
Appleby school He had served in the kings army for a little while and
had been with Admiral Vernons squadron in the West Indies
He had formed so great a liking for the admiral that when he came home
he changed the name of his plantation at Hunting Creek and called it
Mount Vernona name by which it is still known
Not far from Mount Vernon there was another fine plantation called
Belvoir that was owned by William Fairfax an English gentleman of much
wealth and influence
Now this Mr Fairfax had a young daughter as wise as she was beautiful
and so what should Lawrence Washington do but ask her to be his wife
He built a large house at Mount Vernon with a great porch fronting on
the Potomac and when Miss Fairfax became Mrs Washington and went into
this home as its mistress people said that there was not a handsomer or
happier young couple in all Virginia
After young George Washington had changed his mind about going to sea
he went up to Mount Vernon to live with his elder brother For Lawrence
had great love for the boy and treated him as his father would have
done
At Mount Vernon George kept on with his studies in surveying He had a
compass and surveyors chain and hardly a day passed that he was not
out on the plantation running lines and measuring his brothers fields
Sometimes when he was busy at this kind of work a tall whitehaired
gentleman would come over from Belvoir to see what he was doing and to
talk with him This gentleman was Sir Thomas Fairfax a cousin of the
owner of Belvoir He was sixty years old and had lately come from
England to look after his lands in Virginia for he was the owner of
many thousands of acres among the mountains and in the wild woods
Sir Thomas was a courtly old gentleman and he had seen much of the
world He was a fine scholar he had been a soldier and then a man of
letters and he belonged to a rich and noble family
It was not long until he and George were the best of friends Often they
would spend the morning together talking or surveying and in the
afternoon they would ride out with servants and hounds hunting foxes
and making fine sport of it among the woods and hills
And when Sir Thomas Fairfax saw how manly and brave his young friend
was and how very exact and careful in all that he did he said Here
is a boy who gives promise of great things I can trust him
Before the winter was over he had made a bargain with George to survey
his lands that lay beyond the Blue Ridge mountains
I have already told you that at this time nearly all the country west of
the mountains was a wild and unknown region In fact all the western
part of Virginia was an unbroken wilderness with only here and there a
hunters camp or the solitary hut of some daring woodsman
But Sir Thomas hoped that by having the land surveyed and some part of
it laid out into farms people might be persuaded to go there and
settle And who in all the colony could do this work better than his
young friend George Washington
It was a bright day in March 1748 when George started out on his first
trip across the mountains His only company was a young son of William
Fairfax of Belvoir
The two friends were mounted on good horses and both had guns for
there was fine hunting in the woods It was nearly a hundred miles to
the mountaingap through which they passed into the country beyond As
there were no roads but only paths through the forest they could not
travel very fast
After several days they reached the beautiful valley of the Shenandoah
They now began their surveying They went up the river for some
distance then they crossed and went down on the other side At last
they reached the Potomac River near where Harpers Ferry now stands
At night they slept sometimes by a campfire in the woods and sometimes
in the rude hut of a settler or a hunter They were often wet and cold
They cooked their meat by broiling it on sticks above the coals They
ate without dishes and drank water from the running streams
One day they met a party of Indians the first red men they had seen
There were thirty of them with their bodies painted in true savage
style for they were just going home from a war with some other tribe
The Indians were very friendly to the young surveyors It was evening
and they built a huge fire under the trees Then they danced their
wardance around it and sang and yelled and made hideous sport until
far in the night
To George and his friend it was a strange sight but they were brave
young men and not likely to be afraid even though the danger had been
greater
They had many other adventures in the woods of which I cannot tell you
in this little bookshooting wild game swimming rivers climbing
mountains But about the middle of April they returned in safety to
Mount Vernon
It would seem that the object of this first trip was to get a general
knowledge of the extent of Sir Thomas Fairfaxs great woodland
estateto learn where the richest bottom lands lay and where were the
best huntinggrounds
The young men had not done much if any real surveying they had been
exploring
George Washington had written an account of everything in a little
notebook which he carried with him
Sir Thomas was so highly pleased with the report which the young men
brought back that he made up his mind to move across the Blue Ridge and
spend the rest of his life on his own lands
And so that very summer he built in the midst of the great woods a
hunting lodge which he called Greenway Court It was a large square
house with broad gables and a long roof sloping almost to the ground
When he moved into this lodge he expected soon to build a splendid
mansion and make a grand home there like the homes he had known in
England But time passed and as the lodge was roomy and comfortable he
still lived in it and put off beginning another house
Washington was now seventeen years old Through the influence of Sir
Thomas Fairfax he was appointed public surveyor and nothing would do
but that he must spend the most of his time at Greenway Court and keep
on with the work that he had begun
For the greater part of three years he worked in the woods and among the
mountains surveying Sir Thomass lands And Sir Thomas paid him wella
doubloon 824 for each day and more than that if the work was very
hard
But there were times when the young surveyor did not go out to work but
stayed at Greenway Court with his good friend Sir Thomas The old
gentleman had something of a library and on days when they could
neither work nor hunt George spent the time in reading He read the
Spectator and a history of England and possibly some other works
And so it came about that the three years which young Washington spent
in surveying were of much profit to him
The work in the open air gave him health and strength He gained courage
and selfreliance He became acquainted with the ways of the
backwoodsmen and of the savage Indians And from Sir Thomas Fairfax he
learned a great deal about the history the laws and the military
affairs of old England
And in whatever he undertook to do or to learn he was careful and
systematic and thorough He did nothing by guess he never left anything
half done And therein let me say to you lie the secrets of success in
any calling
VITHE OHIO COUNTRY
You have already learned how the English people had control of all that
part of our country which borders upon the Atlantic Ocean You have
learned also that they had made thirteen great settlements along the
coast while all the vast region west of the mountains remained a wild
and unknown land
Now because Englishmen had been the first white men to see the line of
shore that stretches from Maine to Georgia they set up a claim to all
the land west of that line
They had no idea how far the land extended They knew almost nothing
about its great rivers its vasts forests its lofty mountains its rich
prairies They cared nothing for the claims of the Indians whose homes
were there
All the land from ocean to ocean they said belongs to the King of
England
But there were other people who also had something to say about this
matter
The French had explored the Mississippi River They had sailed on the
Great Lakes Their hunters and trappers were roaming through the western
forests They had made treaties with the Indians and they had built
trading posts here and there along the watercourses
They said The English people may keep their strip of land between the
mountains and the sea But these great river valleys and this country
around the Lakes are ours because we have been the first to explore and
make use of them
Now about the time that George Washington was thinking of becoming a
sailor some of the rich planters in Virginia began to hear wonderful
stories about a fertile region west of the Alleghanies watered by a
noble river and rich in game and furbearing animals
This region was called the Ohio Country from the name of the river and
those who took pains to learn the most about it were satisfied that it
would at some time be of very great importance to the people who
should control it
And so these Virginian planters and certain Englishmen formed a company
called the Ohio Company the object of which was to explore the country
and make money by establishing trading posts and settlements there And
of this company Lawrence Washington was one of the chief managers
Lawrence Washington and his brother George had often talked about this
enterprise
We shall have trouble with the French said Lawrence They have
already sent men into the Ohio Country and they are trying in every way
to prove that the land belongs to them
It looks as if we should have to drive them out by force said George
Yes and there will probably be some hard fighting said Lawrence
and you as a young man must get yourself ready to have a hand in it
And Lawrence followed this up by persuading the governor of the colony
to appoint George as one of the adjutantsgeneral of Virginia
George was only nineteen years old but he was now Major Washington and
one of the most promising soldiers in America
VIIA CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
Although George Washington spent so much of his time at Greenway Court
he still called Mount Vernon his home
Going down home in the autumn just before he was twenty years old he
found matters in a sad state and greatly changed
His brother Lawrence was very illindeed he had been ill a long time
He had tried a trip to England he had spent a summer at the warm
springs but all to no purpose He was losing strength every day
The sick man dreaded the coming of cold weather If he could only go to
the warm West Indies before winter set in perhaps that would prolong
his life Would George go with him
No loving brother could refuse a request like that
The captain of a ship in the West India trade agreed to take them and
so while it was still pleasant September the two Washingtons embarked
for Barbadoes which then as now belonged to the English
It was the first time that George had ever been outside of his native
land and it proved to be also the last He took careful notice of
everything that he saw and in the little notebook which he seems to
have always had with him he wrote a brief account of the trip
He had not been three weeks at Barbadoes before he was taken down with
the smallpox and for a month he was very sick And so his winter in the
West Indies could not have been very pleasant
In February the two brothers returned home to Mount Vernon Lawrences
health had not been bettered by the journey He was now very feeble but
he lingered on until July when he died
By his will Lawrence Washington left his fine estate of Mount Vernon
and all the rest of his wealth to his little daughter But George was
to be the daughters guardian and in case of her death all her vast
property was to be his own
And so before he was quite twentyone years old George Washington was
settled at Mount Vernon as the manager of one of the richest estates in
Virginia The death of his little niece not long afterward made him the
owner of this estate and of course a very wealthy man
But within a brief time events occurred which called him away from his
peaceful employments
VIIIA PERILOUS JOURNEY
Early the very next year news was brought to Virginia that the French
were building forts along the Ohio and making friends with the Indians
there This of course meant that they intended to keep the English out
of that country
The governor of Virginia thought that the time had come to speak out
about this matter He would send a messenger with a letter to these
Frenchmen telling them that all the land belonged to the English and
that no trespassing would be allowed
The first messenger that he sent became alarmed before he was within a
hundred miles of a Frenchman and went back to say that everything was
as good as lost
It was very plain that a man with some courage must be chosen for such
an undertaking
I will send Major George Washington said the governor He is very
young but he is the bravest man in the colony
Now promptness was one of those traits of character which made George
Washington the great man which he afterward became And so on the very
day that he received his appointment he set out for the Ohio Country
He took with him three white hunters two Indians and a famous
woodsman whose name was Christopher Gist A small tent or two and such
few things as they would need on the journey were strapped on the backs
of horses
They pushed through the woods in a northwestwardly direction and at
last reached a place called Venango not very far from where Pittsburg
now stands This was the first outpost of the French and here
Washington met some of the French officers and heard them talk about
what they proposed to do
Then after a long ride to the north they came to another fort The
French commandant was here and he welcomed Washington with a great show
of kindness
Washington gave him the letter which he had brought from the governor
of Virginia
The commandant read it and two days afterward gave him an answer
He said that he would forward the letter to the French governor but as
for the Ohio Country he had been ordered to hold it and he meant to do
so
Of course Washington could do nothing further But it was plain to him
that the news ought to be carried back to Virginia without delay
It was now midwinter As no horse could travel through the trackless
woods at this time of year he must make his way on foot
So with only the woodsman Gist he shouldered his rifle and knapsack
and bravely started home
It was a terrible journey The ground was covered with snow the rivers
