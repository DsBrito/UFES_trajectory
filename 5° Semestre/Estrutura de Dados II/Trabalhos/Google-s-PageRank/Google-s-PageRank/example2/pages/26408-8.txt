is sometimes called an atheist from his writings there is nothing from
which such an inference can be drawn unless indeed a Reverend Fellow of
the Royal Society may be held to be the fool who said in his heart etc
etc if his contributions to the Philosophical Transactions go no higher
than nature The following anecdote is well known in Paris but has never
been printed entire Laplace once went in form to present some edition of
his Systeme du Monde to the First Consul or Emperor Napoleon whom some
wags had told that this book contained no mention of the name of God and
who was fond of putting embarrassing questions received it withM
Laplace they tell me you have written this large book on the system of the
universe and have never even mentioned its Creator Laplace who though
the most supple of politicians was as stiff as a martyr on every point of
his philosophy or religion e g even under Charles X he never concealed
his dislike of the priests drew himself up and answered 2 bluntly Je
navais pas besoin de cette hypothesela2 Napoleon greatly amused
told this reply to Lagrange who exclaimed Ah cest une belle hypothese
ca explique beaucoup de choses3
It is commonly said that the last words of Laplace were Ce que nous
connaissons est peu de chose ce que nous ignorons est immense4 This
looks like a parody on Newtons pebbles5 the following is the true
account it comes to me through one remove from Poisson6 After the
publication in 1825 of the fifth volume of the Mecanique Celeste
Laplace became gradually weaker and with it musing and abstracted He
thought much on the great problems of existence and often muttered to
himself Quest ce que cest que tout cela7 After many alternations
he appeared at last so permanently prostrated that his family applied to
his favorite pupil M Poisson to try to get a word from him Poisson paid
a visit and after a few words of salutation said Jai une bonne
nouvelle a vous annoncer on a recu au Bureau des Longitudes une lettre
dAllemagne annoncant que M Bessel a verifie par lobservation vos
decouvertes theoriques sur les satellites de Jupiter8 Laplace opened
his eyes and answered with deep 3 gravity Lhomme ne poursuit que des
chimeres9 He never spoke again His death took place March 5 1827
The language used by the two great geometers illustrates what I have said
a supreme and guiding intelligenceapart from a blind rule called nature
of thingswas an hypothesis The absolute denial of such a ruling power
was not in the plan of the higher philosophers it was left for the smaller
fry A round assertion of the nonexistence of anything which stands in the
way is the refuge of a certain class of minds but it succeeds only with
things subjective the objective offers resistance A philosopher of the
appropriative class tried it upon the constable who appropriated him I
deny your existence said he Come along all the same said the
unpsychological policeman
Euler10 was a believer in God downright and straightforward The
following story is told by Thiebault11 in his Souvenirs de vingt ans de
sejour a Berlin12 published in his old age about 1804 This volume was
fully received as trustworthy and Marshall Mollendorff13 told the Duc de
Bassano14 in 1807 that it was the most veracious of books written by the
most honest of men Thiebault says that he has no personal knowledge of the
truth of the story but 4 that it was believed throughout the whole of
the north of Europe Diderot15 paid a visit to the Russian Court at the
invitation of the Empress He conversed very freely and gave the younger
members of the Court circle a good deal of lively atheism The Empress was
much amused but some of her councillors suggested that it might be
desirable to check these expositions of doctrine The Empress did not like
to put a direct muzzle on her guests tongue so the following plot was
contrived Diderot was informed that a learned mathematician was in
possession of an algebraical demonstration of the existence of God and
would give it him before all the Court if he desired to hear it Diderot
gladly consented though the name of the mathematician is not given it was
Euler He advanced towards Diderot and said gravely and in a tone of
perfect conviction Monsieur a  bn  n  x donc Dieu existe
repondez16 Diderot to whom algebra was Hebrew was embarrassed and
disconcerted while peals of laughter rose on all sides He asked
permission to return to France at once which was granted
ROTATION OF THE MOON
An examination of the Astronomical doctrine of the Moons rotation By
J L17 Edinburgh 1847 8vo
A systematic attack of the character afterwards made with less skill and
more notice by Mr Jellinger Symons
July 1866 J L appears as Mr James Laurie with a new pamphlet The
Astronomical doctrines of the Moons rotation  Edinburgh Of all the
works I have seen on the question this is the most confident and the
sorest 5 A writer on astronomy said of Mr Jellinger Symons18 Of
course he convinced no one who knew anything of the subject This
ungenerous slur on the speculators memory appears to have been keenly
felt but its truth is admitted Those who knew anything of the subject are
the socalled men of science whose three Ps were assailed prestige
pride and prejudice this the author tries to effect for himself with
three Qs quibble quirk and quiddity He explains that the Scribes and
Pharisees would not hear Jesus and that the lordly bishop of Rome will not
cast his tiara and keys at the feet of the humble presbyter who now plays
the part of pope in Scotland I do not know whom he means but perhaps the
friends of the presbyterpope may consider this an ungenerous slur The
best proof of the astronomer is just such as might have been expected from
the merest of blockheads but as the giver is of course not a blockhead
this circumstance shows how deeply blinded by prejudice he must be
Of course the paradoxers do not persuade any persons who know their
subjects and so these Scribes and Pharisees reject the Messiah We must
suppose that the makers of this comparison are Christians for if they
thought the Messiah an enthusiast or an impostor they would be absurd in
comparing those who reject what they take for truth with others who once
rejected what they take for falsehood And if Christians they are both
irreverent and blind to all analogy The Messiah with His Divine mission
proved by miracles which all might see who chose to look is degraded into
a prototype of James Laurie ingeniously astronomizing upon ignorant
geometry and false logic and comparing to blockheads those who expose his
nonsense Their comparison is as foolish assupposing 6 them
Christiansit is profane but like errors in general its other end
points to truth There were Pseudochrists and Antichrists and a
Concordance would find the real forerunners of all the paradoxers But they
are not so clever as the old false prophets there are none of whom we
should be inclined to say that if it were possible they would deceive the
very educated Not an Egyptian among them all can make uproar enough to
collect four thousand men that are murderersof common senseto lead out
into the wilderness Nothing says the motto of this work is so difficult
to destroy as the errors and false facts propagated by illustrious men
whose words have authority I deny it altogether There are things much
more difficult to destroy it is much more difficult to destroy the truths
and real facts supported by such men And again it is much more difficult
to prevent men of no authority from setting up false pretensions and it is
much more difficult to destroy assertions of fancy speculation Many an
error of thought and learning has fallen before a gradual growth of
thoughtful and learned opposition But such things as the quadrature of the
circle etc are never put down And why Because thought can influence
thought but thought cannot influence selfconceit learning can annihilate
learning but learning cannot annihilate ignorance A sword may cut through
an iron bar and the severed ends will not reunite let it go through the
air and the yielding substance is whole again in a moment

Against the moons rotation on her axis
Handed about in the streets in 1847 I quote the whole Important
discovery in astronomy communicated to the Astronomer Royal December
21st 1846 That the Sun revolve round the Planets in 2574825 years
in consequence of the combined attraction of the planets and their
satellites and that the Earth revolve round the Moon in 18 years and
228 days D T GLAZIER altered with a pen into GLAZION Price one

1847 In the United Service Magazine for September 1847 Mrs
Borron21 of Shrewsbury published some remarks tending to impeach the
fact that Neptune the planet found by Galle22 really was the planet
which Le Verrier and Adams23 had a right to claim This was followed
September 14 by two pages separately circulated of Further
Observations upon the Planets Neptune and Uranus with a Theory of
Perturbations and October 19 1848 by three pages of A Review of M
Leverriers Exposition Several persons when the remarkable discovery was
made contended that the planet actually discovered was an intruder and
the future histories of the discovery must contain some account of this
little afterpiece Tim Linkinwaters theory that there is no place like
London for coincidences would have been utterly overthrown in favor of
what they used to call the celestial spaces if there had been a planet
which by chance was put 8 near the place assigned to Neptune at the time
when the discovery was made
EARLY IDEAS OF AVIATION
Aerial Navigation containing a description of a proposed flying
machine on a new principle By Ddalus Britannicus London 1847 8vo
In 184243 a Mr Henson24 had proposed what he called an aeronaut
steamengine and a Bill was brought in to incorporate an Aerial Transit
Company The present plan is altogether different the moving power being
the explosion of mixed hydrogen and air Nothing came of itnot even a
Bill What the final destiny of the balloon may be no one knows it may
reasonably be suspected that difficulties will at last be overcome
Darwin25 in his Botanic Garden 1781 has the following prophecy
Soon shall thy arm unconquered Steam afar
Drag the slow barge or drive the rapid car
Or on widewaving wings expanded bear
The flying chariot through the fields of air
Darwins contemporaries no doubt smiled pity on the poor man It is worth
note that the two true prophecies have been fulfilled in a sense different
from that of the predictions Darwin was thinking of the suggestion of
Jonathan Hulls26 when he spoke of dragging the slow barge it is only
very recently that the steamtug has been employed on the canals The car
was to be driven not drawn and on the common roads Perhaps the flying
chariot will 9 be something of a character which we cannot imagine even
with the two prophecies and their fulfilments to help us27
THE SECRET OF THE UNIVERSE DIVULGED
A book for the public New Discovery The causes of the circulation of
the blood and the true nature of the planetary system London 1848
8vo
Light is the sustainer of motion both in the earth and in the blood The
natural standard the pulse of a person in health four beats to one
respiration gives the natural second which is the measure of the earths
progress in its daily revolution The Greek fable of the Titans is an
elaborate exposition of the atomic theory but any attempt to convince
learned classics would only meet their derision so much does longfostered
prejudice stand in the way of truth The author complains bitterly that men
of science will not attend to him and others like him he observes that
in the time occupied in declining a man of science might test the
merits This is alas too true so well do applicants of this kind know
how to stick on But every rule has its exception I have heard of one The
late Lord Spencer28the Lord Althorp of the House of Commonstold me
that a speculator once got access to him at the Home Office and was
proceeding to unfold his way of serving the public I do not understand
these things said Lord Althorp but I happen to have  naming an
eminent engineer upstairs suppose you talk to him on the subject The
discoverer went up and in halfanhour returned and said I am very much
obliged to your Lordship for introducing me to Mr  he has convinced
me 10 that I am quite wrong I supposed when I heard the storybut it
would not have been seemly to say itthat Lord A exhaled candor and
sense which infected those who came within reach he would have done so
if anybody
THE TRISECTION AND QUADRATURE AGAIN
A method to trisect a series of angles having relation to each other
also another to trisect any given angle By James Sabben 1848 two
quarto pages
The consequence of years of intense thought very likely and very sad
1848 The following was sent to me in manuscript I give the whole of it
Quadrature of the CircleA quadrant is a curvilinear angle traversing
round and at an equal distance from a given point called a center no two
points in the curve being at the same angle but irreptitiously graduating
from 90 to 60 It is therefore a mean angle of 90 and 60 which is 75
because it is more than 60 and less than 90 approximately from 60 to 90
and from 90 to 60 with equal generation in each irreptitious
approximation therefore meeting in 75 and which is the mean angle of the
quadrant
Or suppose a line drawn from a given point at 90 and from the same point
at 60 Let each of these lines revolve on this point toward each other at
an equal ratio They will become one line at 75 and bisect the curve
which is onesixth of the entire circle The result taking 16 as a
diameter gives an area of 201072400 and a circumference of 502681
The original conception its natural harmony and the result to my own
mind is a demonstrative truth which I presume it right to make known
though perhaps at the hazard of unpleasant if not uncourteous remarks
I have added punctuation the handwriting and spelling 11 are those of an
educated person the word irreptitious is indubitable The whole is a
natural curiosity

Peters 8vo n d circa 184829
Suggestions as to the necessity for a revolution in philosophy and
prospectus for the establishment of a new quarterly to be called the
Physical Philosopher and Heterodox Review By Q E D 8vo 1848
These works are by one author who also published as appears by
advertisement
Newton rescued from the precipitancy of his followers through a century
and a half30 and Dangers along a coast by correcting as it is called
a ships reckoning by bearings of the land at night fall or in a fog
nearly out of print Subscriptions are requested for a new edition
The area of a circle is made fourfifths of the circumscribed square
proved on an assumption which it is purposed to explain in a longer
essay31 The author as Q E D was in controversy with the Athenum
journal and criticised a correspondent D who wrote against a certain
class of discoverers He believed the common theories of hydrostatics to be
wrong and one of his questions was
Have you ever taken into account anent gravity and gravitation the fact
that a five grain cube of cork will of itself half sink in the water
whilst it will take 20 grains of brass which will sink of itself to pull
under the other half Fit this if you can friend D to your notions of
gravity and specific gravity as applied to the construction of a universal
law of gravitation
This the Athenum publishedbut without some Italics for which the
editor was sharply reproved as a sufficient 12 specimen of the quod
erat D monstrandum on which the author remarksDWherefore the e
caret is it D apostrophe D DM DMo DMonstrandum we cannot find the
wit of it This I conjecture to contain an illusion to the name of the
supposed author but whether De Mocritus De Mosthenes or De Moivre was
intended I am not willing to decide

Geometry versus Algebra or the trisection of an angle geometrically
solved By W Upton BA33 Bath circa 1849 8vo
The author published two tracts under this title containing different
alleged proofs but neither gives any notice of the change Both contain
the same preface complaining of the British Association for refusing to
examine the production I suppose that the author finding his first proof
wrong invented the second of which the Association never had the offer
and feeling sure that they would have equally refused to examine the
second thought it justifiable to 13 present that second as the one which
they had refused Mr Upton has discovered that the common way of finding
the circumference is wrong would set it right if he had leisure and in
the mean time has solved the problem of the duplication of the cube
The trisector of an angle if he demand attention from any mathematician
is bound to produce from his construction an expression for the sine or
cosine of the third part of any angle in terms of the sine or cosine of
the angle itself obtained by help of no higher than the square root The
mathematician knows that such a thing cannot be but the trisector
virtually says it can be and is bound to produce it to save time This is
the misfortune of most of the solvers of the celebrated problems that they
have not knowledge enough to present those consequences of their results by
which they can be easily judged Sometimes they have the knowledge and
quibble out of the use of it In many cases a person makes an honest
beginning and presents what he is sure is a solution By conference with
others he at last feels uneasy fears the light and puts selflove in the
way of it Dishonesty sometimes follows The speculators are as a class
very apt to imagine that the mathematicians are in fraudulent confederacy
against them I ought rather to say that each one of them consents to the
mode in which the rest are treated and fancies conspiracy against himself
The mania of conspiracy is a very curious subject I do not mean these
remarks to apply to the author before me
One of Mr Uptons trisections if true would prove the truth of the
following equation
3 cos theta  3  1  root4  sin2theta
which is certainly false34
14
In 1852 I examined a terrific construction at the request of the late Dr
Wallich35 who was anxious to persuade a poor countryman of his that
trisection of the angle was waste of time One of the principles was that
magnitude and direction determine each other The construction was
equivalent to the assertion that theta being any angle the cosine of
its third part is
sin 3theta  cos5theta2  sin2 theta sin 5theta2
divided by the square root of
sin2 3theta  cos2 5theta2  sin4 theta  sin 3theta  sin
5theta  sin2 theta
This is from my rough notes and I believe it is correct36 It is so
nearly true unless the angle be very obtuse that common drawing applied
to the construction will not detect the error There are many formulae of
this kind and I have several times found a speculator who has discovered
the corresponding construction has seen the approximate success of his
drawingoften as great as absolute truth could give in graphical
practiceand has then set about his demonstration in which he always
succeeds to his own content
There is a trisection of which I have lost both cutting and reference I
think it is in the United Service Journal I could not detect any error
in it though certain there must 15 be one At least I discovered that
two parts of the diagram were incompatible unless a certain point lay in
line with two others by which the angle to be trisectedand which was
trisectedwas bound to be either 0 or 180
Aug 22 1866 Mr Upton sticks to his subject He has just published The
Uptonian Trisection Respectfully dedicated to the schoolmasters of the
United Kingdom It seems to be a new attempt He takes no notice of the
sentence I have put in italics nor does he mention my notice of him
unless he means to include me among those by whom he has been ridiculed
and sneered at or branded as a brainless heretic I did neither one nor
the other I thought Mr Upton a paradoxer to whom it was likely to be
worth while to propound the definite assertion now in italics and Mr
Upton does not find it convenient to take issue on the point He prefers
general assertions about algebra So long as he cannot meet algebra on the
above question he may issue as many respectful challenges to the
mathematicians as he can find paper to write he will meet with no
attention
There is one trisection which is of more importance than that of the angle
It is easy to get half the paper on which you write for margin or a
quarter but very troublesome to get a third Show us how easily and
certainly to fold the paper into three and you will be a real benefactor
to society
Early in the century there was a Turkish trisector of the angle Hussein
Effendi who published two methods He was the father of Ameen Bey who was
well known in England thirty years ago as a most amiable and cultivated
gentleman and an excellent mathematician He was then a student at
Cambridge and he died years ago in command of the army in Syria Hussein
Effendi was instructed in mathematics by Ingliz Selim Effendi who
translated a work 16 of Bonnycastle37 into Turkish38 This Englishman
was Richard Baily brother of Francis Baily39 the astronomer who
emigrated to Turkey in his youth and adopted the manners of the Turks but
whether their religion also I never heard though I should suppose he did
I now give the letters from the agricultural laborer and his friend
described on page 12 Vol I They are curiosities and the history of the
quadrature can never be well written without some specimens of this kind
Doctor Morgan Sir Permit me to address you
Brute Creation may perhaps enjoy the faculty of beholding visible things
with a more penitrating eye than ourselves But Spiritual objects are as
far out of their reach as though they had no being
Nearest therefore to the brute Creation are those men who Suppose
themselves to be so far governed by external objects as to believe nothing
but what they See and feel And Can accomedate to their Shallow
understanding and Imaginations
My Dear Sir Let us all Consult ourselves by the wise proverb
I believe that evry mans merit  ability aught to be appreciated and
valued In proportion to its worth  utility
In whatever State or Circumstances they may fortunately or unfortunately
be placed
And happy it is for evry man to know his worth and place
When a Gentleman of your Standing in Society Clad with those honors Can
not understand or Solve a problem That is explicitly explained by words and
Letters and 17 mathematically operated by figuers He had best consult the
wise proverd
Do that which thou Canst understand and Comprehend for thy good
I would recommend that Such Gentleman Change his business

July 7th 1849
Sir I have been given to understand that a friend of mine one whom I
shall never be ashamed to acknowledge as 18 such tho lowly his origine
nay not only not ashamed but proud of doing so for I am one of those who
esteem and respect a man according to his ability and probity deeming with
Dr Watts that the mind is the standard of the man40 has laid before
you and asked your opinion of his extraordinary performance viz the
quadrature of the circle he did this with the firmest belief that you
would not only treat the matter in a straightforward manner but with the
conviction that from your known or supposed knowledge of mathematicks would
have given an upright and honorable decision upon the subject but the
question is have you done so Could I say yes I would with the greatest of
pleasure and have congratulated you upon your decision whatever it might
have been but I am sorry to say that I cannot your letter is a paltry
evasion you say that it is a great pity that you Mr  should have
attempted this the quadrature of the circle for your mathematical
knowledge is not sufficient to make you know in what the problem consists
you dont say in what it does consist according to your ideas oh no
nothing of the sort you enter into no disquisition upon the subject in
order to show where you think Mr  is wrong and why you have not is
simplybecause you cannotyou know that he has done it and what is if I
am not wrongly informed you have been heard to say so He has done what
you nor any other mathematician as those who call themselves such have
done And what is the reason that you will not candidly acknowledge to him
as you have to others that he has squared the circle shall I tell you it
is because he has performed the feat to obtain the glory of which
mathematicians have battled from time immemorial that they might encircle
their brows with a wreath of laurels far more glorious than ever conqueror
won it is simply this that it is a poor man a 19 humble artisan who has
gained that victory that you dont like to acknowledge it you dont like to
be beaten and worse to acknowledge that you have miscalculated you have in
short too small a soul to acknowledge that he is right
I was asked my opinion and I gave it unhesitatingly in the affirmative
and I am backed in my opinion not only by Mr  a mathematician and
watchmaker residing in the boro of Southwark but by no less an authority
than the Professor of mathematics of  College   United States
Mr  and I presume that he at least is your equal as an authority and
Mr  says that the government of the US will recompense M D for the
discovery he has made if so what a reflection upon Old england the boasted
land of freedom the nursery of arts and sciences that her sons are obliged
to go to a foreign country to obtain that recompense to which they are
justly entitled
In conclusion I had to contradict an assertion you made to the effect that
there is not nor ever was any reward offered by the government of this
country for the discovery of the quadrature of the circle I beg to inform
you that there was but that it having been deemed an impossibility the
government has withdrawn it I do this upon no less an authority than the
Marquis of Northampton41
I am sir yours

THE MOONS ROTATION
Notes on the Kinematic Effects of Revolution and Rotation with
reference to the Motions of the Moon and of the earth By Henry
Perigal Jun Esq London 18461849 8vo
On the misuse of technical terms Ambiguity of the terms Rotation and
Revolution owing to the double meaning improperly 20 attributed to
each of the words No date nor place but by Mr Perigal42 I have
no doubt and containing letters of 1849 and 1850
The moon controversy Facts v Definitions By H P Jun London
1856 8vo pp 4
Mr Henry Perigal helped me twenty years ago with the diagrams direct from
the lathe to the wood for the article Trochoidal Curves in the Penny
Cyclopdia these cuts add very greatly to the value of the article
which indeed could not have been made intelligible without them He has
had many years experience as an amateur turner in combination of double
and triple circular motions and has published valuable diagrams in
profusion A person to whom the double circular motion is familiar in the
lathe naturally looks upon one circle moving upon another as in simple
motion if the second circle be fixed to the revolving radius so that one
and the same point of the moving circle travels upon the fixed circle Mr
Perigal commenced his attack upon the moon for moving about her axis in
the first of the tracts above ten years before Mr Jellinger Symons43
but he did not think it necessary to make it a subject for the Times
newspaper His familiarity with combined motions enabled him to handle his
arguments much better than Mr J Symons could do in fact he is the
clearest assailant of the lot which turned out with Mr J Symons But he
is as wrong as the rest The assault is now I suppose abandoned until it
becomes epidemic again This it will do it is one of those fallacies which
are very tempting There was a dispute on the subject in 1748 between
James Ferguson44 and an anonymous opponent and I think there have been
others
21
A poet appears in the field July 19 1863 who calls himself Cyclops and
writes four octavo pages He makes a distinction between rotation and
revolution and his doctrines and phrases are so like those of Mr
Perigal that he is a follower at least One of his arguments has so often
been used that it is worth while to cite it
Would Mathematicalsforsooth
If true have failed to prove its truth
Would not theyif they couldsubmit
Some overwhelming proofs of it
But still it totters proofless Hence
Theres strong presumptive evidence
None door cansuch proof profound
Because the dogma is unsound
For were there means of doing so
They would have proved it long ago
This is only one of the alternatives Proof requires a person who can give
and a person who can receive I feel inspired to add the following
A blind man said As to the Sun
Ill take my Bible oath theres none
For if there had been one to show
They would have shown it long ago
How came he such a goose to be
Did he not know he couldnt see
Not he
The absurdity of the verses is in the argument The writer was not so
ignorant or so dishonest as to affirm that nothing had been offered by the
other side as proof accordingly his syllogism amounts to this If your
proposition were true you could have given proof satisfactory to me but
this you have not done therefore your proposition is not true
