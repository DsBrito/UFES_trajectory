intelligent man There were the same eyes but deeper in color and in
meaning the same brow but wider the same mouth but the lips were
firmly closed
Over the womans face ideas and impressions glided without leaving a
furrow or a trace in fact so hastily that her eyes always seemed to
retain a certain astonishment at their flight With the child on the
contrary one felt that impressions remained and his thoughtful air
would have been almost painful had it not been combined with a certain
caressing indolence of attitude that indicated a petted child
Now leaning against his mother with one hand in her muff he listened
to her words with adoring attention and occasionally looked at the
priest and at all the surroundings with timid curiosity He had promised
not to cry but a stifled sob shook him at times from head to foot
Then his mother looked at him and seemed to say You know what you
promised Then the child choked back his tears and sobs but it
was easy to see that he was a prey to that first agony of exile and
abandonment which the first boardingschool inflicts on those children
who have lived only in their homes
This examination of mother and child made by the priest in two or
three minutes would have satisfied a superficial observer but
Father O who had been the director for twentyfive years of the
aristocratic institution of the Jesuits at Vaurigard was a man of the
world and knew too well the best Parisian society all its shades of
manner and dialect not to understand that in the mother of his new
pupil he beheld a representative of an especial class
The selfpossession with which she entered his officeselfpossession
too apparent not to be forcedher way of seating herself her uneasy
laugh and above all the overwhelming flood of words with which she
sought to conceal a certain embarrassment all created in the mind of
the priest a vague distrust Unhappily in Paris the circles are so
mixed the community of pleasures and similarity of toilets have so
narrowed the line of demarcation between fashionable women of good and
bad society that the most experienced may at times be deceived and
this is the reason that the priest regarded this woman with so much
attention The principal difficulty in arriving at a decision arose from
the unconnected style of her conversation but the embarrassed air of
the mother when he asked for the other name of the child settled the
question in his mind
She colored hesitated True she said excuse me I have not yet
presented myself What could I have been thinking of and drawing a
small highlyperfumed case from her pocket she took from it a card on
which in long letters was to be read the insignificant name
Ida de Barnacy
Over the face of the priest flashed a singular smile
Is this the childs name he asked
The question was almost an impertinence The lady understood him and
concealed her embarrassment under an assumption of great dignity
Certainly sir certainly
Ah said the priest gravely
It was he now who found it difficult to express what he wished to say
He rolled the card between his fingers with a little movement of the
lips natural to a man who measures the weight and effect of the words he
is about to speak
Suddenly he arose from his chair and approaching one of the large
windows that looked on a garden planted with fine trees and reddened
by the wintry sun tapped lightly on the glass A black silhouette was
drawn on the window and a young priest appeared immediately within the
room
Duffieux said the Superior take this child out to walk with you
Show him our church and our hothouses he is tired of us poor little
man
Jack supposed that he was sent out to walk so that he might be spared
the pain of saying goodbye to his mother and his terrified despairing
expression so touched the kind priest that he hastily added
Dont be frightened Jack Your mother is not going away you will find
her here
The child still hesitated
Go my dear said Madame de Barancy with a queenly gesture
Then he went without another word as if he were already conquered by
life and prepared for all its evils
When the door closed behind him there was a moment of silence The
steps of the child and his companion were heard on the frozen gravel
and dying away left no sound save the crackling of the fire the chirps
of the sparrows on the eaves the distant pianos and an indistinct
murmur of voicesthe hum of a great boardingschool
This child seems to love you madame said the Superior touched by
Jacks submission
Why should he not love me answered Madame de Barancy somewhat
melodramatically the poor dear has but his mother in the world
Ah you are a widow
Alas yes sir My husband died ten years ago the very year of our
marriage and under the most painful circumstances Ah Monsieur lAbbe
romancewriters who are at a loss to invent adventures for their
heroines do not know that many an apparently quiet life contains enough
for ten novels My own story is the best proof of that The Comte
de Barancy belonged as his name will tell you to one of the oldest
families in Touraine
She made a fatal mistake here for Father O was born at Amboise
and knew the nobility of the entire province So he at once consigned
the Comte de Barancy to the society of MajorGeneral Pembroke and the
Rajah of Singapore He did not let this appear however and contented
himself with replying gently to the soidisant comtesse
Do you not think with me madame that there would be some cruelty in
sending away a child that seems so warmly attached to you He is still
very young and do you think his physical health good enough to support
the grief of such a separation
But you are mistaken sir she answered promptly Jack is a very
robust child he has never been ill He is a little pale perhaps
but that is owing to the air of Paris to which he has never been
accustomed
Annoyed to find that she was not disposed to comprehend him the priest
continued
Besides just now our dormitories are full the scholastic year is very
far advanced we have even been obliged to decline receiving new pupils
until the next term You would be compelled to wait until then madame
and even then
She understood him at last
So she said turning pale you refuse to receive my son Do you
refuse also to tell me why
Madame answered the priest I would have given much if this
explanation could have been avoided But since you force it upon me I
must inform you that this institution whose head I am exacts from
the families who confide their children to us the most unexceptionable
conduct and the strictest morality In Paris there are many laical
institutions where your little Jack will receive every care but with
us it would be impossible I beg of you he added with a gesture of
indignant protestation do not make me explain further I have no right
to question you no right to reproach you I regret the pain I am now
giving and believe me when I say that my words are as painful to myself
as to you
While the priest spoke over the countenance of Madame de Barancy
flitted shadows of anger grief and confusion At first she tried to
brave it out throwing her head back disdainfully but the kind words of
the priest falling on her childish soul made her burst suddenly into a
passion of sobs and tears
She was so unhappy she cried no one could ever know all she had
done for that child Yes the poor little fellow had no name no father
but was that any reason why a crime should be made of his misfortune
and that he should be made responsible for the faults of his parents
Ah M lAbbe I beg of you
As she spoke she took the priests hand The good father sought to
disengage it with some little embarrassment
Be calm dear madame he cried terrified by these tears and outcries
for she wept like the child that she was with vehement sobs and
with the abandonment in fact of a somewhat coarse nature The poor man
thought What could I do with her if this lady should be taken ill
But the words he used to calm her only excited her more
She wished to justify herself to explain things to narrate the story
of her life and willing or not the Superior found himself compelled
to follow her through an obscure recital whose connecting thread she
broke at every step without looking to see how she should ever get back
again to the light
The name of Barancy was not hers but if she should tell him her name
he would be astonished The honor of one of the oldest families in
France was concerned and she would rather die than speak
The Superior hastened to assure her that he had no intention of
questioning her but she would not listen to him She was started and a
windmill under full sail would have been more easily arrested than
her torrent of words of which probably not one was true for she
contradicted herself perpetually throughout her incoherent discourse
yet withal there was something sincere something touching even in this
love between mother and child They had always been together He had
been taught at home by masters and she wished now to separate from him
only because of his intelligence and his eyes that saw things that were
not intended for his vision
The best thing to do it seems to me said the priest gravely would
be to live such a life that you need fear neither the scrutiny of your
child nor of any one else
That was my wish sir she answered As Jack grew older I wished to
make his home all that which it ought to be Besides before long my
position will be assured For some time I have been thinking of
marrying but to do this it was necessary to send my boy away for a time
that he might obtain the education worthy of the name he ought to bear
I thought that nowhere could he do as well as here but at one blow you
repulse him and discourage his mothers good resolutions
Here the Superior arrested her with an exclamation of astonishment He
hesitated a moment then looking her straight in her eyes said
So be it madame I yield to your wishes Little Jack pleases me very
much I consent to receive him among our pupils
My dear sir
But on two conditions
I am ready to accept all
The first is that until the day that your position is assured the
child shall spend his vacations under this roof and shall not return to
yours
But he will die my poor Jack if he does not see his mother
Oh you can come here whenever you please onlyand this is my second
conditionyou will not see him in the parlor but always here in my
private room where I shall take care that you are not interfered with
and that no one sees you
She rose in indignation
The idea that she could never enter the parlor or be present on the
receptiondays when she could astonish the other guests with the beauty
of her child with the richness of her toilette that she could never
say to her friends I met at the school yesterday Madame de C
or Madame de V that she must meet Jack in secret all this
revolted her
The astute priest had struck well
You are cruel with me sir You oblige me to refuse the favor for which
I have so earnestly entreated but I must protect my dignity as woman
and mother Your conditions are impossible And what would my child
think
She stopped for outside the glass she saw the fair curly head of the
child with eyes brightened by the fresh air and by his anxiety Upon a
sign from his mother he entered quickly
Ah mamma how good you are I was afraid you were gone
She took his hand hastily
You will go with me she answered we are not wanted here
And she sailed out erect and haughty leading the boy who was stupefied
by this departure which so strongly resembled a flight She hardly
acknowledged the respectful salute of the good father who had also
risen hastily from his chair but quickly as she moved it was not too
quick for Jack to hear a gentle voice murmur Poor child poor child
in a tone of compassion that went to his heart He was pitiedand why
For a long time he pondered over this
The Superior was not mistaken Madame la Comtesse Ida de Barancy was not
a comtesse at all Her name was not Barancy and possibly not even
Ida Whence came she Who was she No one could say These complicated
existences have fortunes so diverse a past so long and so varied that
one never knows the last shape they assume One might liken them to
those revolving lighthouses that have long intervals of shadow between
their gleams of fire Of one thing only was there any certainty she
was not a Parisian but came from some provincial town whose accent she
still retained It was said that at the Gymnase one evening two Lyons
merchants thought they recognized in her a certain Melanie Favrot who
formerly kept an establishment of gloves and perfumery but these
merchants were mistaken
Again an officer in the Hussars insisted that he had seen her eight
years before at Orleans He also was mistaken And we all know that
resemblances are often impertinences
Madame de Barancy had however travelled much and made no concealment of
the fact but an absolute sorcerer would have been needed to evolve any
facts from the contradictory accounts she gave of her origin and her
life One day Ida was born in the colonies spoke of her mother a
charming creole of her plantation and her negroes Another time she had
passed her childhood in a great chateau on the Loire She seemed utterly
indifferent as to the manner in which her hearers would piece together
these dislocated bits of her existence
As may be imagined in these fantastic recitals vanity reigned
triumphant the vanity of a chattering paroquet Bank and money titles
and riches were the texts of her discourse Rich she certainly was
She had a small hotel on the Boulevard Haussmann she had horses and
carriages gorgeous furniture in most questionable taste three or four
servants and led a most indolent existence trifling away her life
among women like herself less confident in her bearing perhaps
than they from her provincial birth and breeding This and a certain
freshness the result of a childhood passed in the open air all kept
her somewhat out of the current of Parisian life where too being so
newly arrived she had not yet found her place
Once each week a man of middle age and of distinguished appearance
came to see her In speaking of him Ida always said Monsieur with an
air of such respect that one would have supposed him to be at the court
of France in the days when the brother of the king was so denominated
The child spoke of him simply as our friend The servants announced
him as M le Comte but among themselves they called him the old
gentleman
The old gentleman was very rich for madame spared nothing and there
was an enormous expenditure going on constantly in the house This was
managed by Mademoiselle Constant Idas waitingmaid It was this woman
who gave her mistress the addresses of the tradespeople who guided her
inexperience through the mazes of life in Paris for Idas pet dream and
hope was to be taken for a woman of irreproachable character and of the
highest fashion
Thus it will be seen into what state of mind the reception of Father
O had thrown her and in what a rage she left his presence An
elegant coupe awaited her at the door of the Institution She threw
herself into it with her child retaining only sufficient selfcommand
to say home in so loud a voice that she was heard by a group of
priests who were talking together and who quickly dispersed before this
whirlwind of furs and curled hair In fact as soon as the carriagedoor
was closed the unhappy woman sank into a corner not in her usual
coquettish position but overwhelmed and in tears stifling her sobs in
the quilted cushions
What a blow The priest had refused to take her child and at the first
glance had discovered the humiliating truth that she believed to have
thoroughly disguised under the luxurious surroundings of a woman of the
world and of an irreproachable mother
Her wounded pride recalled with renewed flushes of shame the keen eyes
of the good father She recalled all her falsehood all her folly and
remembered his incredulous smile at almost her first words
Silent and motionless in the other corner of the carriage sat Jack
looking sadly at his mother unable to comprehend her despair He
vaguely conceived himself to be in fault the dear little fellow and
yet was secretly glad that he had not been left at the school
For a fortnight he had heard of it night and day his mother had
extorted a promise from him not to weep his trunk was packed and all
was ready and the childs heart was full of trouble and now at the
last moment he was reprieved
If his mother had not been in so much trouble now he would have thanked
her how happy would he have been curled up at her side under her
furs in the little coupe in which they had had so many happy hours
togetherhours which were now to be repeated And Jack thought of
the afternoons in the Bois of the long drives through the gay city
of Parisa city so new to both of them and full of excitement and
interest A monument perhaps or even a mere street incident delighted
them
Look Jack
Look mamma
They were two children together and together they peered from the
windowthe childs head with its golden curls close to the mothers
face tightly veiled in black lace
A despairing cry from Madame de Barancy aroused the boy from all these
sweet recollections Mon dieu she cried wringing her hands what
have I done to be so wretched
This exclamation naturally elicited no response and little Jack not
knowing what to say or how to console her timidly caressed her hand
even at last kissing it with the fervor of a lover
She started and looked wildly at him
Ah cruel cruel child what harm you have done me in this world
Jack turned pale I What have I done
He loved but one person on the face of the earth his mother He thought
her absolutely perfect and without knowing it he had injured her in
some mysterious way The poor child was now overwhelmed with despair
also but remained utterly silent as if the noisy demonstrations of his
mother had shocked him and made him ashamed of any manifestations on
his own part He was seized with a sort of nervous spasm His mother
took him in her arms No no dear child I was only in jest be
sensible dear What must I rock my longlegged boy as if he were a
baby No little Jack you never did me any harm It is I who did wrong
Come do not weep any more See I am not crying
And the strange creature forgetful of her recent grief laughed
gayly that Jack too might laugh It was one of the privileges of this
inconsequent nature never to retain impressions for any length of time
Singularly enough too the tears she had just shed only seemed to add
new freshness and brilliancy to her youthful beauty as a sudden shower
upon a doves plumage seems to bring out new lustre without penetrating
below the surface
Where are we now said she suddenly dropping the window that was
covered with mist At the Madeleine How quickly we have come We must
stop somewhere at the pastrycooks I think Dry your eyes little
one we will buy some meringues
They alighted at the fashionable confectioners where there was a great
crowd Rich furs and rustling silks crushed each other and womens
faces with veils half lifted were reflected in the surrounding mirrors
which were set in gilt frames and creamcolored panels glittering
glass and a variety of cakes and dainties delighted the spectators
Madame de Barancy and her child were much looked at This charmed her
and this small success following upon the mortification of the previous
hour gave her an appetite She called for a quantity of meringues and
nougat and finished by a glass of wine Jack followed her example but
with more moderation his great grief having filled his eyes with unshed
tears and his heart with suppressed sighs
When they left the shop the weather was so fine although cold and the
flowermarket of the Madeleine so fragrant with the sweet perfume of
violets that Ida determined to dismiss the carriage and return on foot
Briskly and yet with a certain slowness of step that indicated a woman
accustomed to admiration she started on her walk leading Jack by
the hand The fresh air the gay streets and attractive shops quite
restored Idas goodhumor Then suddenly by what connection of ideas
I know not she remembered a masqued ball to which she was going that
night preceded by a restaurant dinner
Mercy I had forgotten Hurry little Jackquick She wanted flowers
a bouquet a dozen forgotten trifles and the child whose life had
always been made up of just such trifles and who felt as much as his
mother the subtile charm of these elegances followed her in high glee
delighted by the idea of the fete that he was not to see The toilette
of his mother always interested him and he fully appreciated the
admiration her beauty excited as they went through the streets and into
the various shops
Exquisite exquisite Yes you may send it to meBoulevard Haussmann
Madame de Barancy tossed down her card and went out talking gayly to
Jack of the beauty of her purchases Suddenly she assumed a graver air
Remember Jack what I say Do not tell our good friend that I went to
this ball it is a great secret It is five oclock How Constant will
scold
She was not mistaken
Her maid a tall stout person of forty years ugly and masculine
rushed toward Ida as she entered the house
The costume is here There is no sense in being so late Madame will
not be ready in season No one could make her toilette in such a little
while
Dont scold Constant If you only knew what had happened Look and
she pointed to Jack
The factotum seemed utterly out of patience What Master Jack back
again That is very naughty sir after all you promised The police
will have to come and take you to school your mother is too good
No no it was not he The priest would not have him Do you
understand They insulted me Whereupon she began to cry again and to
ask of heaven why she was so unhappy What with the meringues and the
nougat the wine and the heat of the room she soon felt very ill
She was carried to her bed salts and ether were hastily sought
Mademoiselle Constant acquitted herself with the propriety of a woman
who is no stranger to such scenes went in and out of the room opened
and shut wardrobes with a certain selfpossession that seemed to
say This will soon pass off But she did not perform her duties in
silence
What folly it was to take this child to the Fathers As if it was a
place for him in his position It would not have been done certainly
had I been consulted I would engage to find a place for this boy at
very short notice
Jack terrified at seeing his mother so ill had seated himself on the
edge of the bed where looking at her anxiously he in silence asked
her pardon for the sorrow he had caused her
There get away Master Jack Your mother is all right I must help her
dress now
What You do not mean Constant that I must go to this ball I have no
heart to amuse myself
Pshaw I know you madame You have but five minutes Just look at this
pretty costume these rosecolored stockings and your little cap
She shook out the skirts displayed the trimming and jingled the little
bells which adorned it and Ida ceased to resist
While his mother was dressing Jack went into the boudoir and remained
alone in the dark The little room perfumed and coquettish was it
is true partially illuminated by the gas lamps on the boulevard Sadly
enough the child leaned against the windows and thought of the day that
was just over By degrees without knowing how he felt himself to be
the poor child of whom the priest had spoken in such compassionate
tones
It is so singular to hear ones self pitied when one believes ones self
to be happy There are sorrows in fact so well concealed that those
who have caused them and even sometimes their victims do not divine
them
The door openedhis mother was ready
Come in Master Jack and see if this is not lovely
Ah what a charming Folly Silver and pink lustrous satin and delicate
lace What a lovely rustling of spangles when she moved
The child looked on in admiration while the mother light and airy
waving her Momus staff smiled at Jack and smiled at herself in the
Psyche without at that time asking heaven why she was so unhappy Then
Constant threw over her shoulders a warm cloak and accompanied her to
the carriage while Jack leaning over the railing watched from stair
to stair moving almost as if she were dancing the little pink slippers
embroidered with silver that bore his mother to balls where children
could not go As the last sound of the silver bells died away he turned
towards the salon disturbed and anxious for the first time by the
solitude in which he ordinarily passed his evenings
When Madame de Barancy dined out Master Jack was confided to the tender
mercies of Constant She will dine with you said Ida
Two places were laid in the diningroom that seemed so huge on such
days But very often Constant finding her dinner anything but cheerful
took the child and joined her companions below where they feasted
gayly The tablecloth was soiled and the conversation was not of the
purest and very often the conduct of the mistress of the house was
commented upon in words to be sure that were slightly veiled so as not
to frighten the child This evening there was a grand discussion as to
the refusal of the Fathers to receive the boy The coachman declared
that it was all for the bestthat the priests would have made of the
child a hypocrite and a Jesuit
Constant protested against these words She was not a professor of
religion she said but she would not hear it spoken ill of Then the
discussion changed to the great disappointment of Jack who listened
with all his little ears hoping to hear why this priest who appeared
so good was not willing to receive him
But for the moment Jack was of little consequence each was absorbed in
narrating his or her religious convictions
The coachman who had been drinking said that his God was the sun in
fact he like the elephants adored the sun Suddenly some one asked
how he knew that elephants adored the sun
I saw it once in a photograph said he sternly Upon which
Mademoiselle Constant vehemently accused him of impiety and atheism
while the cook a stout Picardian with true peasant shrewdness told
them to be quiet
Hush she said you should never quarrel over your religions
And Jackwhat was he doing all this time
At the end of the table stupefied by the heat and the interminable
discussions of these brutes he slept with his head on his arms and
his fair curls spread over his velvet sleeves In his unrestful slumber
he heard the hum of the servants voices and at last he fancied that
they were talking of him but the voices seemed to reach from afar
offthrough a fog as it were
Who is he then asked the cook
I dont know answered Constant but one thing is certain he cant
remain here and she wishes me to find a school for him
Between a yawn and a hiccough the coachman spoke
I know a capital school and one that will just answer your purpose
It is called the Moronval Collegeno not collegebut the Moronval
Academy But what of that it is a college all the same I put my child
there once when I was ordered off with the Egyptian army The grocer
gave me the prospectus and I think I have it still
He looked in his portfolio and from among the tumbled and soiled papers
he extracted one dirtier even than the others
Here it is he cried with an air of triumph
He unfolded the prospectus and began to read or rather to spell with
difficulty
Gymnase Moronvalin thein the
Give it to me said Mademoiselle Constant and taking it from him she
read it at one glance
Moronval Academysituated in the finest quarter of Parisa
family schoollarge gardenthe number of pupils limitedcourse of
instructionparticular attention paid to the correction of the accent
of foreigners
Mademoiselle Constant interrupted herself here to breathe and to
exclaim This seems all right enough
I think so said the cook
The reading of the prospectus was resumed but Jack was soundly asleep
and heard no more
He was dreaming Yes while his future was thus under discussion
around this kitchentable while his mother was dancing as Folly in
her rosecolored skirts and silver bells he was dreaming of the kind
priest and of the tender voice that had murmuredPoor child
CHAPTER IITHE SCHOOL IN THE AVENUE MONTAIGNE
23 Avenue Montaigne in the best quarter of Paris said the
prospectus And no one can deny that the Avenue Montaigne is well
situated in the Champs Elysees but it has an incongruous unfinished
aspect as of a road merely sketched and not completed
By the side of the fine hotels with their plateglass windows hung with
silken draperies stand the houses of workmen whence issue the noise of
hammers and grating of saws One part of the Faubourg seems also to be
relinquished to gardens after the style of Mabille
At the time of which I speak and possibly now from the avenue ran two
or three narrow lanes whose sordid aspect offered a strange contrast to
the superb buildings near them One of these lanes opened at the number
23 and announced on a gilded sign swinging in the passage that the
Moronval Academy was there situated This sign however once passed it
seemed to you that you were taken back forty years and to the other
end of Paris The black mud the stream in the centre of the lane the
reverberations from the high walls the drinkingshops built from old
planks all seemed to belong to the past From every nook and cranny
from stairs and balconies whence fluttered linen hung to dry streamed
forth a crowd of children escorted by an army of lean and hungry cats
