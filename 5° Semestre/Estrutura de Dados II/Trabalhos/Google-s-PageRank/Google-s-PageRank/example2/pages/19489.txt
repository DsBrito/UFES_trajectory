CANOE MATES IN CANADA
or
Afloat on the Saskatchewan
CHAPTER I
A PLUNGE DOWN THE RAPIDS
Kneeling in a bullboat fashioned from the skin of an animal and
wielding a paddle with the dexterity only to be attained after years of
practice in canoeing a sturdilybuilt and thoroughly bronzed Canadian
lad glanced ever and anon back along the course over which he had so
recently passed and then up at the black storm clouds hurrying out of
the mysterious North
It was far away in the wilderness of the Northwest where this fierce
tributary of the great Saskatchewan came pouring down from the
timberclad hills and all around the lone voyager lay some of the
wildest scenery to be met with on the whole continent
Here and there in this vast territory one might come across the
occasional trading posts of the widereaching Hudson Bay Company at
each of which the resident factor ruled with the arbitrary power of a
little czar
It might be he would discover the fire of some Ishmaelite of the forest
a wandering timbercruiser marking out new and promising fields for
those he served and surveying the scene of possible future bustling
logging camps
Otherwise the country at this time was a vast unknown land seldom
penetrated by human kind save the Indian fur gatherers
Considering that he was in so vast a wilderness this adventurous lad
appeared to have scant luggage in his well battered bullboatindeed
beyond the buskskin jacket which he had thrown off because of his
exertions there did not seem to be anything at all aboard the craft
not even a gun by means of which he might provide himself with food
while on the journey downstream
This singular fact would seem to indicate that he might have had trouble
of some sort back yonder
Indeed the occasional glances which he cast over his shoulder added
strength to this possibility though the look upon his strong face was
more in the line of chagrin and anger than fear
Now and then he shook his curly head and muttered something and once a
name passed his lips in anything but a friendly fashionthat of
Alexander Gregory
Swifter grew the current giving plain warning to one so well versed as
this lad must be in the vagaries of these mad rivers of the Silent Land
that presently it would be racing furiously down a steep incline with
razoredge rocks on every side apparently only too eager to rend asunder
the frail canoe of the adventurous cruiser
Still Owen Dugdale continued to ply the nimble paddle weaving it in and
out like a shuttle
He kept to the middle of the river when it would seem to at least have
been the part of wisdom had he edged his craft closer to either shore
so that he might in time make a safe landing in preference to trusting
himself to the mercy of the wild rapids in which his frail bullboat
would be but as a chip in the swirl of conflicting waters
Already had the vanguard of the storm swept down upon him
An inky pall began to shut out the daylight and when a sudden flash of
lightning cleft the lowhanging clouds overhead the effect was perfectly
staggering
The roar of thunder that followed quick upon its heels was like the
explosion of a twelveinch gun as heard in the steeljacketed turret of
a modern battleship
Again and again was the rushing river with its grim forestclad shores
lighted up by the rapidfire electric flashes
All around crashed the loudtoned thunderclaps rumbling and roaring
until the whole affair became a perfect pandemonium and brave indeed
must be the soul that could gaze upon it without dismay and flinching
It was just then before the rain had begun to descend and while the
artillery of heaven flashed and roared with all the fury of a
Gettysburg that Owen Dugdale found himself plunging into the dangerous
rapids ten times more to be feared under such conditions than ordinary
Possibly he may have regretted his rashness in sticking to the middle of
the channel until it was too late to change his course but apparently
the solitary young Canuck was at the time in somewhat of a desperate
frame of mind and recked little what might be the result of his mad act
of defiance to the combined powers of tempest and boiling rapids
At least he showed no signs of shrinking from the consequences
Beyond shifting his weight a trifle as if to settle himself better for
the desperate work that faced him he remained just as before on his
knees
Crouching amidships lie held his paddle poised as if ready to thrust it
into the swirling water at a seconds notice to stay the progress of
the canoe as it lunged toward a threatening rock or glided too near a
roaring whirlpool where disaster was certain to follow
Owen Dugdale was no novice at shooting rapids though never before could
he have undertaken such a fierce fight as the one in which he was now
engaged for the combination of the elements made it simply appalling
The stirring scene might have appealed to the instinct of an artist but
so far as the lad was concerned he had only eyes for the perils with
which he was surrounded and his whole soul seemed wrapped up in the
prompt meeting of each emergency as it flashed before him
A dozen times he would have met with sudden disaster but for the
instantaneous manner in which his hand followed the promptings of his
brain
Even then it was a mighty close shave more than once for the boat
rubbed up against several snags in whirling past any one of which
would have sunk the frail craft had it been a headon collision
Once he had to paddle like a madman to keep from being sucked into the
largest whirlpool along the course which seemed to reach out eager
fingers and strive to the utmost to engulf him in its gluttonous maw
Thanks to the almost incessant lightning Owen was enabled to see these
perils in time to take action else he must have been speedily
overwhelmed in the fury of the rushing waters
While the time might have seemed an eternity to the brave lad who
battled for his very life in reality it could not have been more than a
couple of minutes at most that he was shooting down that foamy descent
dodging hither and thither as the caprice of the rapids or the impetus
of his paddle dictated
Just below him was the finish of the dangerous fall and as so often
happens the very last lap proved to be more heavily charged with
disaster than any of those above even though they appeared to be far
worse
Being a son of the wilderness Owen Dugdale had probably never heard of
the kindred terrors that used to lie in wait for the bold mariners of
ancient Greecethe rock and the whirlpool known as Scylla and
Charybdisif they missed being impaled upon the one they were apt to
be engulfed in the otherand yet here in the rapids of this furious
Saskatchewan feeder he was brought face to face with a proposition
exactly similar to that of mythology
He strove valiantly to meet the occasion and his sturdy sweep of the
paddle did send him away from the ugly pointed rock but the last
whirlpool was so close that he was not enabled to fully recover in time
to throw his whole power into the second stroke consequently his canoe
was caught in the outer edge of the swirl and before one could even
wink twice it capsized
This was not the first time Owen had met with such a disaster while
shooting rapids and he had his wits about him for all of the confusion
that surrounded him there
His very first act was to clutch hold of the canoe and throw all his
energies into the task of avoiding the deadly suction of the whirlpool
for once he fell into its grip there must be only a question of seconds
ere he reached its vortex and went under
Fortune aided by his own violent efforts favored him and as a result
he managed to swim down the balance of the rapid and reach the smoother
waters below still hanging on with a desperate clutch to his poor old
boat while his other hand gripped the paddle
The canoe was full of water but it did not sink being buoyant enough
to keep on the surface but Owen found it as much as he could do to push
the unwieldly thing along when he began to make for the nearest shore
Exciting as this adventure had been it was only an episode in a life
such as he had spent up in this vast region where the first lesson a
boy learns is to take care of himself and meet peril in any guise
There was not the least doubt with regard to his ability to gain the
nearby shore with his wrecked canoe even if left to himself
Nevertheless when his ears caught the sound of encouraging shouts and
he realized that his perilous descent of the rapids had been witnessed
by sympathetic eyes it gave Mm a thrill to know that friends were near
by and waiting to assist him if such were necessary
But young Dugdale was an independent lad accustomed to relying
altogether upon his own endeavors as one must always do whose life is
spent in the heart of the Great Lone Land of the Far Northwest
Hence he kept on swimming with his boat until he could wade and in
this way came out of the river dripping temporarily held in check by
his misfortune but not in the least dismayed
Two figures hurried to meet him though they arrived too late to give
him a helping hand in effecting a landing
Owen looked at them in amazementhe had at the most anticipated that
those whose encouraging shouts had reached his ears while in the water
must be some timbercruisers who chanced to be camping at the foot of
the rapids for the fishing to be found there or it might be several of
the halfbreed voyageurs employed by the Hudson Bay Company to carry
furs from far distant posts to some station on the railroad but he
found himself gazing upon neither
Two boys confronted him neither of them much older than himself and
utter strangers at that
Owen had never had a chum and indeed his life had been a lonely one
burdened by responsibilities that had made him much older than his
yearshis scanty associations had been with hardy lumbermen or
voyageurs so that the presence of this twain struck him as the most
mysterious and remarkable thing in all his experience
And they seemed so solicitous concerning his welfare insisting upon
taking hold of the boat and pulling the same clear of the water that he
almost began to fancy he must be dreaming
Now exclaimed the taller of the two when this job had been finished
come right up to our tent where we have a bully fire that will dry you
off in a jiffy And our coffee is just ready tooI rather guess
thatll warm you up some Eli its lucky you made an extra supply
after all Looks as if you expected wed have company drop in on us
Ill carry the paddlegood you hung on to it for its a tough job to
whittle one out I know Here we are old chap and believe me youre a
thousand times welcome
CHAPTER II
THE CAMP UNDER THE HEMLOCKS
Young Owen Dugdales heart thrilled within him
In all his life he could not exactly remember a single time when he had
been thus warmly welcomed to any camp Why it was almost worth shooting
the rapids and meeting with disaster to hear such words and feel that
every one was meant
Who were these lads and why were they here in this faraway land
His astonished eyes fell upon the craft that had evidently carried them
up the river from some hamlet scores perhaps hundreds of miles away
Such a dandy canoe Owen Dugdale had never dreamed existed in the whole
wide world for it was of varnished cedar and with its nickeled
trimmings glistened there under the hemlocks in the flash of the
lightning and the glow of the protected campfire
He seemed to feel somehow that this apparent calamity upon the river had
been the open sesame for him to enter upon a new and perhaps
delightful experience rather a rough introduction perhaps but then he
knew only such in the range of his past
And the delicious odor of that supper was enough to arouse the dormant
appetite of one who had foresworn all cookery one of these modern
cranks determined to exist upon nuts and fruit which our young friend
of the bullboat certainly was not
Both lads bustled about trying to make him comfortable near the cheery
blaze and then filling a pannikin with the canoeists stew of corn
beef succotash and leftover potatoes they invited him to setto nor
wait for them a second
Owen could not have restrained himself once his nostrils became
saturated with those delicious odors and he started to eat like a
starving chap as indeed he came very near being seeing that he had
not partaken of a mouthful of food for almost twentyfour hours and
then but scantily
Then came a cup of such coffee as he had never before tasted with
condensed milk to mellow the same and close at his hand was placed a
package of crackers into which he was expected to dip as the humor
seized him
Boys never like to talk while hungry and no matter how strong the
curiosity on both sides might be nothing was said beyond the usual
courtesies necessary in passing things until one and all declared
themselves satisfied
But although their tongues were silent during this halfhour their
eyes did double duty and Owen found a thousand things at which to
wonder
The canoe had been enough to excite his curiosity but everything he saw
about the camp was in keeping with such luxury
The duncolored tent was a beauty and doubtless positively waterproof
for the rain that had been beating down ever since they commenced eating
had found no inlet and the fly over the fire sufficed to keep it from
being extinguished
He saw several warbags of the same kind of canvas evidently used for
the storage of clothes and provisions and in addition there were a
couple of guns rubber ponchos gray blankets that peeped out of two
expensive sleeping bags and a couple of black japanned boxes the
contents of which he could not picture unless they might be something
in the way of surveyors instruments for Owen had once seen a party of
these gentry running a line through the forest and hence his vague
application now
These things had been taken in with a few glances around but the two
boys themselves occupied most of his attention and he found himself
trying to study out what they werethe taller one he understood
immediately must be in command for his whole appearance indicated it
while the shorter chap was of the calibre not unlike himself bronzed
from a life in the open and with a cheery manner that drew the waif
toward him from the start
Both were dressed for business with no unnecessary frills and it was
evident that if the leader of the mysterious expedition was possessed of
unlimited means he also had enough common sense to deny himself luxuries
when upon such a long cruise
When every one declared that not another bite could be taken Eli pulled
out a pipe being evidently addicted to smoking and his comrade
finding that the newcomer had dried out pretty thoroughly hunted up a
spare jacket from one of the bags which he insisted upon Owen donning
since the storm now a thing of the past had been followed by a cool
wave that made the fire doubly pleasant
Now said the tall lad with one of his winning smiles that drew Owen
to him so wonderfully lets exchange confidences a bit just as far as
you care to go and no further First of all my name is Cuthbert
Reynolds and Im from across the border a Yankee to the backbone and
this is Eli Perkins also an American boy a native of the lumber
regions of Michigan and with his fortunes bound up in mine
And Im Owen Dugdale said the other knowing the pause was intended
for him to break in with the mention of his name a native Canuck and
at home in this timber regionmy parents were of Scotch descent I
believe And the first thing I want to say is that Im mighty glad to be
here with you just now I was just about as hungry as a bear and only
for you I dont see what I could have done after that ducking for my
matches must have been wet and I would have gone to sleep hungry and
cold
The tall lad hastened to interrupt him evidently not fancying being
thanked for doing what was apparently the greatest pleasure in the world
to him
Hold on please we understand all that Youre a thousand times
welcome and I tell you right now nothing could have happened to please
me better than meeting up with you You can bet theres something
besides chance in it Now naturally youre wondering what in the
dickens two fellows of our stripe are doing wandering about up here in
the Far Northwest like a couple of nomads
Well perhaps when you learn the actual truth youll wonder harder than
ever how it is one of us has escaped landing in a lunatic asylum up to
this time but as some of my friends say to me youthful enthusiasm is
responsible for many queer things and so long as my wonderful ambition
is to copy after Stanley in the line of exploring why they dont
worry
They say I have more money than I know what to do with anyway and if
it must be blown in somehow why this is a harmless way of doing it
dangerous only to myself and any other foolish chap whom I may
influence to accompany me on my mad expeditions and as he spoke he
glanced affectionately in the direction of the homely freckled but
goodhumored Eli who returned the look with a grin and an emphatic nod
of approval
Now you see Eli has been with the lumbermen all his life and is as
hardy as they make them What he doesnt know about the woods isnt
worth telling and so we make a pretty good team for Ive picked up a
little knowledge about camp life during my canoeing days in the East
and manage to fill in the gaps in Elis education along the line of
woodcraft
I might as well make a full confession in the start for youre bound
to get on to my weakness if we see much of each other and I hope we
will Ever since I was kneehigh to a grasshopper Ive been inoculated
with the exploring bee read everything ever printed in that line and
pictured myself doing wonderful stunts like Livingstone and Stanley
It was only to be expected then that when I was left my own master at
the death of my father I would pursue my hobby to the limit and I
rather guess I have been on the jump for two years Havent made myself
famous yet and a little of my enthusiasm in that line has dribbled
away but Im just as determined to work in the field of research as
ever only age is beginning to tone down my earlier wild notions and
after this last and crowning folly I think I shall hitch up with some
veteran who knows it all and be content to work up from the ranks
I started out on this expedition with great notions of making such a
trip as no man had ever before attempted passing up a branch of the
Saskatchewan making a portage with the assistance of the Crees or
Chippewas to some convenient branch of the Athabasca River and voyage
on to the lake of that name by fall winter there perhaps at the Hudson
Bay Post and in the spring by means of the chain of lakes and rivers
that I understand connect the Athabasca Lake with Hudson Bay arrive at
that vast sheet of water in time to be picked up by some whaler and
carried home a winner
Makes you smile I guesswell it strikes me as funny now that Ive
been navigating this country for several months and only gotten this
far but when I laid out the trip it was a serious business for me and
I couldnt see anything but success ahead of me Ive had my fun and
Im ready to call the game off This is a mans work I understand now
and Im out of the exploring business for the time only now that were
up so far Eli and myself want to see all we can of the country and Eli
has some notions in the line of discovering rich copper ledges that he
means to work while wandering about this unknown land eh old man
In this boyish familiar manner did he address his comrade and Eli as
usual laughed goodnaturedly and nodded his headevidently he had a
fund of humor in his makeup that could not be disturbed by any amount
of joshing
Cuthbert halted in his explanations he did not hint at such a thing
but evidently it was up to Owen to tell something at least in connection
with his presence in the neighborhood and how he came to be rushing
down the dangerous rapids at the time the storm broke when it would
appear the part of wisdom for one who knew the peril involved as well as
he did to land and portage around the troubled water
The lad acted a little as though confused not knowing just how much he
should tell in connection with himself but taking a brace he finally
spoke upEli was adding some wood to the fire from a stock they had
laid in dry when the storm was seen approaching while Cuthbert busied
himself in making his seat more comfortable though in reality it was
done in order not to appear to be noticing the coloringup of the guest
about whom he seemed to realize that there was a bit of a mystery
I told you my name was Owen Dugdale and that I had always lived up in
this country Well that is hardly so for when I was a little chap I
remember being in Montreal with my parents for a spell but they came
back here and Ive never gone out of the woods since
My mother taught me all I know for she was a lady and had been
educated in a convent school in that city My father was used to the
life of the woods and I learned everything connected with that from
him I lost my mother two years ago and my father later Thats about
all there is in connection with me II had some trouble up the river
at the post and was making my way down with the intention of leaving
this country forever when this accident happened Im glad it did
happen because its thrown me in with two such good fellows Youll be
surprised when I tell you that Ive never had a boy friend in all my
life andwell its mighty fine to be sitting here and talking with
you both I wish I could do something to return the favor thats what
You canstay with us a while and let us have some of the benefit of
your knowledge of the country Wed like nothing better and if you have
no other place to go why make a third member of the crowd You have a
boat and as for grub and such why were loaded down with it Dont
decide just now but think it over and tell us in the morning We wont
take no for an answer remember
Owen turned his head away as if to look at something he fancied moved
along the edge of the camp but it was to conceal the tears that came
unbidden into his eyesthe genuine warmth of this invitation stirred
his heart and as some resolution sprang into life he gripped his hands
and set his teeth hard
CHAPTER III
COMRADES
The young Canadian sat for a few minutes mute as though turning over
this proposition of Cuthberts in his mind then suddenly raising his
eyes he looked his new friend straight in the face and said
Thats awfully white of you and Im going to accept your invitation
Ill be only too glad to stay with you for a time at least and serve
you as guide And if you still persist in your determination to ascend
the river further to see all you can while in this country who should
know that region better than myself Let come what will I am going
back
The impulsive American after his kind was bound to seal the bargain
with a hearty handshake and Eli not to be outdone in the matter also
thrust out his broad paw as he called it squeezing that of the other
with a strength that made Owen wince a bit
At the same time the observing Cuthbert could not but note the gritting
of Owens teeth when he declared that he was ready to go back into the
country from which he had apparently just come it would appear as
though some recent experience up the river did not linger fondly in his
memory and that when he came paddling downstream in his battered old
bullboat it might have been with the idea of quitting the country for
good
Naturally this aroused a little curiosity in the others mind though he
was not addicted to this failing overly much
What could there be in the depths of the wilderness to bring about this
aversion on the part of young Dugdale
If Cuthbert had allowed himself to ruminate upon this subject all sorts
of suspicions might have been aroused but he was by nature too frank
and generous to judge a stranger before he had been given a chance to
explain and the more he looked in the face of the lad and noted the
calm depths of his gray eyes the stronger grew his conviction that Owen
Dugdale as he called himself could not descend to anything wrong
Some persons carry their character in their faces and he was of the
number So Cuthbert made up his mind to chase all suspicion from his
mind if in his own time the Canadian chose to confide in him well and
good until then he would forget what he had seen of first anxiety and
then grim determination stamped upon that young face
Both of the wouldbe explorers were cast in somewhat of a merry mould
and it was impossible to be in their company long without partaking of
their happygolucky spirit
To the sober Owen this was about as fine a thing as could ever have
happened for he found it utterly out of the question to ponder gloomily
upon the bitter past while these two chaps were whipping jokes back and
forth and insidiously drawing him into the conversation until greatly
to his astonishment he even burst out into a hearty peal of laughter
the first expression of merriment that had sprung from his heart for
many a day
Perhaps a benign Providence had taken pity upon him and was now bent on
sending sunshine where hitherto there had been little save clouds and
storm
The more he saw of these cousins from over the line the better he liked
them
It was a favorite joke of Cuthberts to compare himself with that
wonderfully humorous character of Spanish literature who took himself
so solemnly even while he furnished merriment for everybodyDon
Quixote the Knight of La Manchathis wild expedition into the depths
of the Northwestern Unknown Land was now in the originators mind
about as weird and ridiculous a proposition as any of the adventures of
the crazy knight and he never tired of cracking broad jokes upon the
subject
Of course as was natural honest Eli must pose for the faithful squire
Sancho Panza and long since he had been told the whole story so that
he was now acquainted with most of the peculiarities of that worthy and
even at times managed to tickle his friend and employer by carrying out
the idea in some manner
Owen was not ignorant as to the facts for it chanced that he had read
the book having found an old copy in his cabin home the property of
his mother so that he was in a condition to enjoy the joke whenever
there happened to be a reference made to the ancient couple
The storm had long since passed away down the river growling in the
distance for quite a time but gradually the stars came peeping out in
the broad blue dome overhead and while the woods dripped with the
moisture the prospect for a good day on the morrow seemed propitious
There was room in the tent for three with a little goodnatured
crowding and while Owen protested against intruding he was turned down
instantly and compelled to take his place
Never in all his life had he been drawn to any one as he was toward
these two bighearted fellows from across the border and when he lay
down finally after busying himself for half an hour about the fire he
felt like a new boy such is the confidence generated in the human heart
by comradeship
Owen had intentionally chosen a position near the exit of the tent for
seeing that he had spent his life under similar conditions and it was
second nature with him to attend to a fire during the night he would
not hear of either of his new friends attempting it
In spite of his getting up several times between that hour and the
breaking of dawn Owen slept sounder than he had done for many a day he
seemed to feel a new confidence in himself as if matters had taken a
turn for the better and in this accidental meeting with his benefactors
his fortunes had begun to assume a less gloomy aspect
Once as he was about snuggling down under the extra blanket which had
been assigned to him he rested his head upon his hand his elbow being
on the ground and surveyed the two sleeping lads for the firelight
crept through the opening of the tent and revealed the interior
It was difficult for him to believe that he had only known these good
fellows a comparatively few hours so strong a hold had they taken upon
his heart that it seemed as though he must have met them in his dreams
for they appeared to be occupying a space in his affections that was
theirs by right
So the morning found them
When Cuthbert awoke he discovered that the new addition to the exploring
party was already busily employed in getting things ready for breakfast
whereupon there arose a friendly argument as to whose duty it was to
hustle things for the morning meal
This was finally settled by arranging matters so that the three of them
could take turns about in the daily duties and Owen chose to begin
then
The others were not adverse to letting him have a whack at the culinary
department for they had been going together for a long time now and
both had about exhausted their repertoire in the line of cookery so
that a change would really be a delightful diversion for almost every
camper has his favorite dishes upon which he prides himself and when
two such come together there is always more or less of a friendly
rivalry to see which can outdo the other
By degrees such a party comes to recognize the particularly strong
points of each member so that in the end they make a fine team every
one being a star in his favorite line
Breakfast was eaten with more or less good natured chaff such as boys
will always indulge in and older campers as well for when in the woods
it seems as if being brought close back to Nature makes children of us
all showing that it is only the care and worry of a strenuous battle
for wealth or power that forces men to appear aged and serious
After that came a portage for the canoes and all the camp duffle had to
