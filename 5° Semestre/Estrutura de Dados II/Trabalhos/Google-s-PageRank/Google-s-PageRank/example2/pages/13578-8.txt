THE GLOWWORM
That pretty sparkler of our summer evenings so often made the
ploughboys prize the only brilliant that glitters in the rustics hat
the glowworm lampyris noctiluca is not found in such numbers
with us as in many other places where these signal tapers glimmer upon
every grassy bank yet in some seasons we have a reasonable sprinkling
of them Every body probably knows that the male glowworm is a winged
erratic animal yet may not have seen him He has ever been a scarce
creature to me meeting perhaps with one or two in a year and when
found always a subject of admiration Most creatures have their eyes
so placed as to be enabled to see about them or as Hook says of the
housefly to be circumspect animals but this male glowworm has a
contrivance by which any upward or side vision is prevented Viewed
when at rest no portion of his eyes is visible but the head is
margined with a horny band or plate being a character of one of the
genera of the order coleoptera under which the eyes are situate
This prevents all upward vision and blinds or winkers are so fixed
at the sides of his eyes as greatly to impede the view of all lateral
objects See Figures The chief end of this creature in his
nightly peregrinations is to seek his mate always beneath him on the
earth and hence this apparatus appears designed to facilitate his
search confining his view entirely to what is before or below him The
first serves to direct his flight the other presents the object of his
pursuit and as we commonly and with advantage place our hand over the
brow to obstruct the rays of light falling from above which enables us
to see clearer an object on the ground so must the projecting hood of
this creature converge the visual rays to a point beneath
Glowworms emit light only for a short period in the year and I have but
partially observed it after the middle of July I have collected many of
these pretty creatures on a bank before my house into which they retire
during the winter to shine out again when revived by the summers
warmth but in this latter season I have frequently missed certain of
my little proteges and have reason to apprehend that they formed the
banquet of a toad that frequented the same situation
Observing above that the glowworm does not emit light after the 14th of
July I mean thereby that clear steady light which has rendered this
creature so remarkable to all persons for I have repeatedly noticed
deep in the herbage a faint evanescent light proceeding from these
creatures even as late as August and September This was particularly
manifested September the 28th 1826 The evening was warm and dewy and
we observed on the housebank multitudes of these small evanescent
sparks in the grass The light displayed was very different from that
which they exhibit in warm summer months Instead of the permanent green
glow that illumines all the blades of the surrounding herbage it was a
pale transient spot visible for a moment or two and then so speedily
hidden that we were obliged in order to capture the creature to
employ the light of a candle The number of them and their actions
creeping away from our sight contrary to that half lifeless dulness
observed in summer suggested the idea that the whole body had availed
themselves of this warm moist evening to migrate to their winter
station A single spark or so was to be seen some evenings after this
but no such large moving parties were discovered again If we conclude
that the summer light of the glowworm is displayed as a signal taper
the appearance of this autumnal light can have no such object in view
nor can we rationally assign any use of it to the creature itself
unless indeed it serves as a point of union in these supposed
migrations like the leading call in the flight of nightmoving birds
The activity and numbers of these insects in the abovementioned
evening enabled me to observe the frequent presence and disappearance
of the light of an individual which did not seem to be the result of
will but produced by situation During the time the insect crawled
along the ground or upon the fine grass the glow was hidden but on
its mounting any little blade or sprig of moss it turned round and
presented the luminous caudal spot which on its falling or regaining
its level was hidden again
A summary of the peculiarities of the year 1825 very appropriately
concludes the volume from which we may be tempted to make future
extracts
THE TALIPOT TREE
The first of our Engravings is a species of palm a native of Ceylon
and is one of the most magnificent wonders of the vegetable kingdom The
leaf is circular terminating in the most beautiful rays and folding up
into plaits like a fan which in figure it nearly resembles
This leaf is used in the maritime provinces of Ceylon as a mark of
distinction each person being allowed to have a certain number of these
leaves folded up as fans carried with him by his servants and also in
the Kandian country in the shape of a round flat umbrella on a long
stick The talipot leaves are likewise used by the common people to
shelter themselves from the rain one leaf affording sufficient
shelter for seven or eight persons It is also used in making tents
In 1818 Sir Alexander Johnston gave to Sir Joseph Banks a very fine
specimen of a tent made of their leaves large enough to hold a party of
ten persons at table
All the books of importance in Pali and Cingalese relative to the
religion of Buddhoo in Ceylon are written on lamina of these leaves
with either a brass or an iron style There are some of these books in
Sir A Johnstons collections which are supposed to be from 500 to 600
years old and which are still very perfect In the museum of the
Asiatic Society there is a complete copy of the Pali book called the
Pansyapanas Iatakah written on 1172 laminae of the finest
description of this sort of palm leaf Large as the dimensions of the
talipot leaf may appear it is exceeded in size by the troolie of
Surinam which extends on the ground and has frequently been known to
attain the width of three feet and the length of thirty
Our Engraving is copied from the Gardeners Magazine where it is
reduced from the Transactions of the Asiatic Society
THE DEATHWATCH MAGNIFIED
Although the present may be a late hour to dissipate the faith placed in
signs and tokens we are persuaded that a more intimate knowledge of
this insect will not prove uninteresting to our readers3
The name death watch was evidently derived from the importance
attached to the beatings of the insect which by superstitious people
were formerly supposed to prognosticate death to some one of the family
in whose house it was heard The natural size of the insect is about a
quarter of an inch in length of a dark brown colour spotted with
transparent wings under the vagina or sheath a huge cap or
helmet on the head and two antennae or feelers from beneath
the eyes
It is chiefly in the advanced period of spring that these insects
commence their noise and which is the call or signal by which they are
mutually attracted to each other and may be considered as analogous to
the call of birds This noise does not arise from their voice but from
the insect beating on hard substances with the shield or fore part of
its head The general number of successive distinct strokes is from 7 to
9 or 11 These are given in pretty quick succession and are repeated at
uncertain intervals and in old houses where the insects are numerous
they may be heard if the weather be warm almost every hour in the day
The noise exactly resembles that made by beating moderately hard with
the finger on a table Mr Stackhouse carefully observed its manner of
beating He says the insect raises itself upon its hinder legs and
with the body somewhat inclined beats its head with great force and
agility against the place on which it stands
This insect which is the real deathwatch of the vulgar must
not be confounded with another minuter insect which makes a ticking
noise like a watch but instead of beating at intervals it continues
its noise for a considerable time without intermission This latter
belongs to a very different tribe It is usually found in old wood
decayed furniture neglected books c and both the male and the
female have the power of making this ticking noise in order to attract
each other The Rev Mr Derham seems to have been the first naturalist
who examined and described this species and he says that during the
month of July in one particular summer they scarcely ever ceased to
beat either in day or night The eggs are generally hatched about the
beginning of March many of them live through the winter but during
that time to avoid the frost they bury themselves deep in dust
Mr T Carpenter of whose paper in Gills Repository we have
already availed ourselves tells us that these insects are excellent
anatomists in order to render them useful in making some delicate
dissections for his microscope Mr Carpenter placed a few of the
insects within a pillbox with the heads of three dead flies He found
some time afterwards that they had cleared the interior of some of the
eyes completely from all the bloodvessels leaving the lenses in the
cornea beautifully transparent
BIRDS NESTS
The structure of the nests of birds affords perhaps one of the most
agreeable lessons in Natural History
Among the most curious nests of our English birds may be named
that of the Wren the longtailed Titmouse the Thrush
the Goldfinch the Chaffinch the Magpie and the House
Sparrow to these may also be added the Swallows the Martins
the Wood Pigeons and the WoodPeckers Of the nests of Rooks
it may be sufficient to observe that they are often found to the number
of six or even more in a cluster Crows nests are always
solitary they are similar in structure to those of the rook
Among the nests of Foreign birds that of the Taylor Bird
deserves especial mention the bird itself is a diminutive one being
little more than three inches long it is an inhabitant of India The
nest is sometimes constructed of two leaves one of them dead the
latter is fixed to the living one as it hangs upon the tree by sewing
both together in the manner of a pouch or purse it is open at the top
and the cavity is filled with fine down and being suspended from the
branch the birds are secure from the depredations of snakes and
monkeys to which they might otherwise fall a prey
In Dr Lathams collection is a specimen of the taylor birds nest
composed of a single large leaf of a fibrous rough texture about six
inches long independent of the stalk five inches and a half in breadth
and ending in a point The sides of this leaf are drawn together so as
to meet within threequarters of an inch within is the nest about four
inches deep and two broad opening at the top the bottom of the leaf
is drawn upwards to assist in the support of it The interior nest is
composed of white down with here and there a feather and a small
portion of white down intermixed
Another nest of this bird has also been described as composed of several
leaves like those of some kind of hazel sewed together the inner nest
formed of dry bents fibres and hairs suspended from a tree It is
therefore probable that this bird as well as some others varies the
structure of its nest as occasion and the materials may require These
singular works are performed by the birds using his bill instead of a
needle and vegetable fibres for thread
The Rufous Beeeater or Merops Rufus constructs also a
very singular nest This bird is a native of Buenos Ayres the nest is
built generally on the naked great branch of a tree sometimes on the
windows of houses a fence or a projecting beam of a high house or
other building it is composed of earth in the form of a bakers oven
and is often built in the short space of two days both birds being
engaged in its construction it is six inches in diameter and one
thick a division is within beginning at the entrance and carried
circularly so that the eggs are deposited in the inner chamber on a
bed of grass The swallow and other birds often attempt to obtain
possession of this nest but are generally repulsed by the owners
Many of the Orioles nests are also deserving notice The
black and yellow Oriole inhabiting South America has a pendent
nest shaped like an alembic it is affixed to the extreme branches of
trees sometimes it is said so many as four hundred nests are found
hanging on the same tree
The Philippine and Pensile Grosbeak make also very curious nests
In concluding this account of the nests of birds I may notice here the
nest of the Hirundo esculenta or Esculent Swallow an inhabitant
of China and the Islands of the Indian Ocean The nest consists of a
gelatinous substance in shape resembling an apple cut down the middle
The nests are found in great numbers together and are by the luxurious
Asiatics made into broths and otherwise cooked and are esteemed one of
the greatest dainties of the table they are also occasionally used for
glueJenningss Ornithologia
1 We are pleased therefore to commence our Supplementary Sheet
with such a volume as the present which we have reserved for
this purpose The feelings which it must engender in the reader
will be doubly grateful in these troublous times of strong
political excitement they enjoin peace on earth and goodwill
towards men the Divine antidote to the storms of conflicting
interests and passions and the balm which heals the thorny
wounds of the world that cross every path and tear the finest
sympathies of our nature It adds moreover a pleasant variety
to the contents of our sheet and alternates with the
vicissitudes of enterprise in the progress of infant liberty
in the New World as in the Memoirs of the patriot Millerthe
daring and recklessness of crime as in the vivid sketch of
First and Lastthe picturesque country and ceremonies of
Arabia and its religious people as drawn by Burckhardtand
the architectural embellishment of the Metropolis as shown in

2 In the MIRROR dated March 1 1828 we noticed Gilbert Whites
Natural History of Selborne is one of the most delightful
household books in our language and we are surprised at the
rarity of such works The publication of the Journal of a
Naturalist early in March 1829 is a coincidence
3 Philosophers and wits have written on this subject Sir Thomas
Brown who wrote a book of Vulgar Errors remarks with great
seriousness that the man who could eradicate this error from the
minds of the people might prevent the fearful passions of the
heart and many cold sweats taking place in grandmothers and
nursesSwift lets fly the shafts of satire in these lines
A woodworm
That lies in old wood like a hare in her form
With teeth or with claws it will bite or will scratch
And chambermaids christen this worm a deathwatch
Because like a watch it always cries click
Then woe be to those in the house who are sick
For sure as a gun they will give up the ghost
If the maggat cries click when it scratches the post
Gay too in a pastoral dirge says
The wethers bell
Before the drooping flock tolld forth her knell
The solemn deathwatch clickd the hour she died
FINE ARTS
METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS
Abridged from the Introduction to Brittons Picture of London 26th
edition just published
The year 1825 will ever be memorable in the annals of the
metropolis for more novel improvements changes and events occurred in
that one year than during any other corresponding period Schemes
for the formation of new Companiesthe vast speculations arising
out of them tending to the aggrandizement of a few persons and to the
ruin of others with the utilities of some and the futilities and
impositions of manymay also be said to belong to this year
Let us however take a brief review of the real improvements and useful
novelties that have been progressing or have commenced in London since
that singular and eventful era Commencing at the court or west end we
will take an imaginary tour to the east adverting to such new buildings
as are calculated to arrest the attention of the stranger in our
progress Without remarking on the general improvements of the age we
shall find enough to engross our attention in the particular objects
before us The most noted or conspicuous of these are1 The New
Palace with the adjoining Park and Gardens 2 A Terrace Street and
Public Buildings on the site of Carlton House 3 Belgrave Square and
the adjoining Squares and Streets 4 The Entrance Lodges and Bridge
in Hyde Park with the improvements in the Roads and Walks of the same
5 The Regents Park with its Terraces Villas Public Buildings
Zoological Gardens and Colosseum 6 The London University 7 The
British Museum 8 The Post Office 9 London Bridge and its Vicinity
10 St Katherines Docks 11 The New Buildings and Alterations
connected with the Houses of Parliament the Ministerial Offices and
others at Charing Cross All these rank among the novelties and
embellished features of London and whilst the design and execution of
so many public works manifest the increasing taste or luxury of the
age they employ and give encouragement to numerous artists artisans
and tradesmen
Of the Royal Palace suffice it to remark in this place that it
is a large pile of buildinghas been carried on with great rapidity of
executionits whole exterior is stone many parts of which are adorned
with sculptured statues bassorelievo and other ornamentsthat a
highlydecorated triumphal arch composed of fine white marble is
to be raised at a short distance from the centre of the principal
frontand that the interior is to be splendidly adorned with marble
scagliola and other rich materials whilst the galleries armoury
chapel staterooms c are to display the most gorgeous ornaments of
the cabinetmaker upholsterer decorative painter and other artisans
The Park in front of this palace which had continued for nearly
a century in one state of formal tasteless insipidity has been laid
out as a large pleasuregarden interspersed with lawn clusters of
shrubs and flowers winding walks varied surface and a lake whose
margin is made to wind with every inequality of surface spreading
occasionally into a broad expanse and then contracting to a narrow arm
In the midst of the larger spaces are islands covered with aquatic
trees and shrubs
The Gardens or Pleasure Grounds belonging to the Palace
partake of the same character but are adorned with shrubs plants and
flowers of a more choice description A large piece of water is likewise
formed in the midst of these Gardens
Belgrave Square and Vicinity Immediately to the west of the
boundarywall of the royal gardens is a tract of ground which in 1824
was open fields intersected by mudbanks and partly occupied by a few
sheds and inhabited by the lowest characters of society In 1829 the
same land consisting of about 140 acres is nearly covered with houses
of the largest size surrounding spacious squares or skirting wide and
handsome streets Of all the extraordinary works carried into effect by
London gentlemen and tradesmen we may fairly adduce this as a
preeminent example In the space of about four years the houses
surrounding one large square called Belgrave have been erected some
of them finished and occupied and several others of nearly equal
dimensions and value completed
The most prominent feature of this district is Belgrave Square
which includes within the front walls of the houses an area of about ten
acres the centre of which enclosed by lofty and handsome railing is
laid out as a pleasure garden The whole of the houses are large lofty
and spacious with stuccoed fronts porches balustraded balconies
and those in the centre of each side are decorated with columns or
threequarter columns vases on the parapet c
Of Eaton Square one portion only is built at present as laid
out planted and railed in it is intended to occupy an area of about
fourteen acres and will be bounded by four rows of houses on the north
side and the like number on the south side having the kings private
road extending east and west through the centre It measures 600 yards
long by 120 yards wide between the houses At the eastern extremity is
a new church built from the designs of Henry Hakewill Esq
To the north of this district at Hyde Park Corner is a large new
edifice appropriated to St Georges Hospital It is a commodious
and handsome building from the designs of R Smirke Esq Near it and
forming an entrance lodge to the Palace Gardens is a bold large and
highlydecorated archway built from the designs of Decimus Burton Esq
Opposite is a screen of columns with three entrance archways a lodge
c constituting an architectural entrance to Hyde Park Three other
lodges with gates by Mr Burton form so many other entrances to the
Park from the east and northApsley House the town mansion of
the Duke of Wellington at the southeast angle of Hyde Park is
rebuilding from the designs of Messrs B and C Wyatt and will form a
handsome object at this entrance to the metropolis
The Earl of Grosvenor has set a most laudable example to our opulent
nobility in the new wing to his mansion in Grosvenor Street as a
gallery for his valuable pictures It is a handsome and imposing design
and does honour to the architect Mr Cundy
The new Club Houses in St Jamess Street especially that near
the southern end present imposing fronts and it may be added that
most of the other Club Houses have contributed very much to adorn their
respective situations and to impart a strictly architectural character
to our street buildings
The site of Carlton House and its gardens is occupied by a wide
street by a lofty terrace overlooking the Park by club houses c Two
of the latter terminate Waterloo Place and are appropriated to the
United Service and the Athenaeum the first built from
the designs of Mr Nash and the latter from those of Mr D Burton
From Charing Cross to Exeter Change an amazing improvement has
commenced All the houses on the north side of the Strand are taking
down and others raising farther back by which the street will be much
widened and the new buildings will assume better faces if not better
accommodation for the tradesmen who occupy them That museum of sheds
stalls and filth Covent Garden is also to be cleared and
cleansed and respectable ranges of shops and warerooms are to be
erected
It is now confidently said that the Kings College of London
is to be attached to the eastern side of Somerset House and that Mr
Smirke is commissioned to make a design for the building
In the Regents Park a new Terrace and other buildings are in
progress the great Colosseum is nearly finished and the Zoological
Gardens have excited unusual popularity No less than 130000
visiters have been admitted to view the gardens and the vivarium within
the year 1828
On the east side of the Park is a mass of buildings appropriated to
St Katherines Hospital consisting of a chapel in the centre
with a group of dwellings on each side and a detached mansion for the
master South of this is a series of buildings called Cumberland
Terrace raised from the designs of Mr Nash which is abundantly
adorned with columns arches statues and bassorelievo
The Colosseum in the same Park is a building of great
dimensions and novel appropriation and therefore calculated to excite
very popular attention Near this is the Diorama an edifice of
singular construction destined for the public display of two pictures
A new line of communication from this Park to Pall Mall has been
completed within the last few years by a wide and handsome road called
Regent Street
London UniversityThe situation of the first University founded
in this immense city is most peculiarly favourable being equally
removed from the busy and confined part of the metropolis and from the
fashionable and idle whilst it is not inconveniently remote from either
extremity The building was commenced on the 30th of April 1827 when
the Duke of Sussex laid the first stone in the presence of a large
concourse of noblemen and gentlemen The design is by William Wilkins
Esq RA who has evinced in the principal elevation and general
character of the edifice considerable taste and science When completed
it is intended to consist of a central part and two wings projecting at
right angles from the extremities of the former The first portion only
of this is at present finished It extends from north to south 430 feet
with a depth from east to west including the two semicircular
theatres of about 200 feet The elevation is at once classical and
chaste having a bold and rich portico in the centre elevated on a
plinth to the height of the first story 19 feet and is approached
by numerous steps which are arranged to produce a fine effect Twelve
Corinthian columns support a flattened pediment in the tympanum of
which is to be a composition in bassorelievo analogous to science and
literature Behind this pediment is a cupola finished by a lantern
light in imitation of a peripteral temple crowning and ornamenting a
grand octagonal vestibule or saloon North of this is the museum of
natural history 118 feet by 50 and 23 feet in height opening to
the museum of anatomy which latter communicates with two rooms for
professors and to one of the large theatres or lecturerooms East of
the vestibule is a large hall and to the south is the great library
corresponding in size c with the museum of natural history the
small library rooms for the librarian for apparatus and also another
large theatre The groundfloor consists of rooms for lectures the
Professors offices laboratory museum a spacious cloister 213 feet
by 24 rooms for the anatomical school c In the basement are other
apartments for the anatomical schools for the chemical laboratory
the students common room kitchen stewards room refreshment rooms
housekeepers room vaults c
At the British Museum a new room to contain the late kings
library has been built and fitted up from the designs of Mr R Smirke
It is the largest apartment in this country its measurement being 300
feet in length by 30 feet in width and 30 feet high
The St Katherines Docks recently formed near the Tower will
increase this species of accommodation and be a great improvement to a
district where reform and alteration are much required By a statement
published by the Committee in October 1828 it appears that the first
stone was laid 3rd of May 1827 and that a grand ceremony was exhibited
on the 25th of October 1828 of opening the Docks On that occasion
nine vessels of from 516 to 343 tons burden entered the docks to load
and discharge their freights Above 1200 houses warehouses c were
purchased and taken down to make room for the new works Accommodation
is provided for the stowage of 210000 tons of merchandize and from
the improved construction of the warehouses these goods will be always
housed under cover The fixed capital for completing this great
commercial undertaking is 1352752l
A Collier Dock on a large scale has been projected to be
excavated and formed in the Isle of Dogs near Blackwall for which
Mr George Rennie has made plans and estimates
The New London Bridge now nearly completed is a work of great
magnitude science and novelty Its erection in our times and
following the recent finishing of the bridges of Waterloo and Southwark
is a memorable event in the annals of London
The projected Tunnel under the Thames is not only a novel object
in this part of London but should it ever be accomplished it will be
a wonderful triumph of human talents over seeming impossibilities
Although so many useful and even important improvements have been
recently effected in the metropolis there are yet many things left
undone that ought to be done and others proceeding in a manner that
will neither be creditable nor beneficial The widening and opening of
New Streets from Pall Mall to the British Museum from that
national repository to Waterloo Bridge skirting the two theatresfrom
the Strand to Lincolns Inn Fields and thence to Holborn and again
to Covent Gardenfrom Charing Cross to Somerset Housefrom Oxford
Road to Bloomsbury Square and Holbornfrom Blackfriars Bridge to
Clerkenwell removing and clearing away that nuisance in a public
thoroughfare Fleet Marketfrom Moorfields to the Bank and thence
obliquely to Southwark Bridgewidening and opening the area around
St Pauls Cathedralare all calculated to be very beneficial to
the public Other essential alterations are still required and the
legislature as well as all publicspirited individuals should
cooperate to promote them The formation of open respectable quays
terraces and streets on the banks of our fine river is an event
greatly to be desired
The vastlyincreasing population of London has occasioned a great
augmentation of Churches and Chapels both for congregations
of the establishment and for dissenters In consequence of urgent and
argumentative appeals by some truly pious and benevolent Christians the
legislature has granted a large sum for the purpose of aiding parochial
committees to build new churches or enlarge their old ones
The New Post Office in St MartinsleGrand is fast
approaching conclusion and will constitute one of the most imposing
public buildings of the city Preparatory to the reerection of the
whole of the Blue Coat School or Christs Hospital in
Newgate Street a spacious and handsome Hall has been erected from the
designs of Mr Shaw
A new Chapel of novel design being of an amphitheatrical form
has been recently completed from the designs of W Brooks
architect It is seated near the Catholic Chapel in Finsbury Circus
THE SKETCHBOOK
THE FIRST AND LAST CRIME
Blackwoods Magazine for the current month contains a sketchy
article under this title which displays much of the breadth and vigour
of one of Magas contributors Our extract is in the form of the
confession of a reckless daring spirit who being imprisoned for
murder commits suicide The early developement of his bad passions is
admirably drawn and altogether this is one of the most powerfully
written papers that we have lately met with
