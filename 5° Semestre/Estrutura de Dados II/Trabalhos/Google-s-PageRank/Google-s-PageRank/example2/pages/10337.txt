philosophy The materialism of our age will not help us here It is
indeed a miracle something from outside our world altogether an
event which we would willingly accept if we were to meet it invested
with the authority of Divine Revelation in the scriptures but which we
are not prepared to encounter almost in our time happening in
Oxfordshire amongst our neighbours
The only things which go any way towards an explanation of it are but
guesswork and I give them more because I would not conceal anything
than because I think they are of any worth
Mrs Tebricks maiden name was certainly Fox and it is possible that
such a miracle happening before the family may have gained their name
as a soubriquet on that account They were an ancient family and have
had their seat at Tangley Hall time out of mind It is also true that
there was a halftame fox once upon a time chained up at Tangley Hall in
the inner yard and I have heard many speculative wiseacres in the
publichouses turn that to great accountthough they could not but
admit that there was never one there in Miss Silvias time At first I
was inclined to think that Silvia Fox having once hunted when she was
a child of ten and having been blooded might furnish more of an
explanation It seems she took great fright or disgust at it and
vomited after it was done But now I do not see that it has much bearing
on the miracle itself even though we know that after that she always
spoke of the poor foxes when a hunt was stirring and never rode to
hounds till after her marriage when her husband persuaded her to it
She was married in the year 1879 to Mr Richard Tebrick after a short
courtship and went to live after their honeymoon at Rylands near
Stokoe Oxon One point indeed I have not been able to ascertain and
that is how they first became acquainted Tangley Hall is over thirty
miles from Stokoe and is extremely remote Indeed to this day there is
no proper road to it which is all the more remarkable as it is the
principal and indeed the only manor house for several miles round
Whether it was from a chance meeting on the roads or less romantic but
more probable by Mr Tebrick becoming acquainted with her uncle a
minor canon at Oxford and thence being invited by him to visit Tangley
Hall it is impossible to say But however they became acquainted the
marriage was a very happy one The bride was in her twentythird year
She was small with remarkably small hands and feet It is perhaps worth
noting that there was nothing at all foxy or vixenish in her appearance
On the contrary she was a more than ordinarily beautiful and agreeable
woman Her eyes were of a clear hazel but exceptionally brilliant her
hair dark with a shade of red in it her skin brownish with a few dark
freckles and little moles In manner she was reserved almost to shyness
but perfectly selfpossessed and perfectly wellbred
She had been strictly brought up by a woman of excellent principles and
considerable attainments who died a year or so before the marriage And
owing to the circumstance that her mother had been dead many years and
her father bedridden and not altogether rational for a little while
before his death they had few visitors but her uncle He often stopped
with them a month or two at a stretch particularly in winter as he was
fond of shooting snipe which are plentiful in the valley there That
she did not grow up a country hoyden is to be explained by the
strictness of her governess and the influence of her uncle But perhaps
living in so wild a place gave her some disposition to wildness even in
spite of her religious upbringing Her old nurse said Miss Silvia was
always a little wild at heart though if this was true it was never
seen by anyone else except her husband
On one of the first days of the year 1880 in the early afternoon
husband and wife went for a walk in the copse on the little hill above
Rylands They were still at this time like lovers in their behaviour and
were always together While they were walking they heard the hounds and
later the huntsmans horn in the distance Mr Tebrick had persuaded her
to hunt on Boxing Day but with great difficulty and she had not
enjoyed it though of hacking she was fond enough
Hearing the hunt Mr Tebrick quickened his pace so as to reach the edge
of the copse where they might get a good view of the hounds if they
came that way His wife hung back and he holding her hand began
almost to drag her Before they gained the edge of the copse she
suddenly snatched her hand away from his very violently and cried out
so that he instantly turned his head
Where his wife had been the moment before was a small fox of a very
bright red It looked at him very beseechingly advanced towards him a
pace or two and he saw at once that his wife was looking at him from
the animals eyes You may well think if he were aghast and so maybe
was his lady at finding herself in that shape so they did nothing for
nearly halfanhour but stare at each other he bewildered she asking
him with her eyes as if indeed she spoke to him What am I now become
Have pity on me husband have pity on me for I am your wife
So that with his gazing on her and knowing her well even in such a
shape yet asking himself at every moment Can it be she Am I not
dreaming and her beseeching and lastly fawning on him and seeming to
tell him that it was she indeed they came at last together and he took
her in his arms She lay very close to him nestling under his coat and
fell to licking his face but never taking her eyes from his  The
husband all this while kept turning the thing in his head and gazing on
her but he could make no sense of what had happened but only comforted
himself with the hope that this was but a momentary change and that
presently she would turn back again into the wife that was one flesh
with him
One fancy that came to him because he was so much more like a lover
than a husband was that it was his fault and this because if anything
dreadful happened he could never blame her but himself for it
So they passed a good while till at last the tears welled up in the
poor foxs eyes and she began weeping but quite in silence and she
trembled too as if she were in a fever At this he could not contain his
own tears but sat down on the ground and sobbed for a great while but
between his sobs kissing her quite as if she had been a woman and not
caring in his grief that he was kissing a fox on the muzzle
They sat thus till it was getting near dusk when he recollected
himself and the next thing was that he must somehow hide her and then
bring her home
He waited till it was quite dark that he might the better bring her into
her own house without being seen and buttoned her inside his topcoat
nay even in his passion tearing open his waistcoat and his shirt that
she might lie the closer to his heart For when we are overcome with
the greatest sorrow we act not like men or women but like children
whose comfort in all their troubles is to press themselves against their
mothers breast or if she be not there to hold each other tight in one
anothers arms
When it was dark he brought her in with infinite precautions yet not
without the dogs scenting her after which nothing could moderate their
clamour
Having got her into the house the next thing he thought of was to hide
her from the servants He carried her to the bedroom in his arms and
then went downstairs again
Mr Tebrick had three servants living in the house the cook the
parlourmaid and an old woman who had been his wifes nurse Besides
these women there was a groom or a gardener whichever you choose to
call him who was a single man and so lived out lodging with a
labouring family about half a mile away
Mr Tebrick going downstairs pitched upon the parlourmaid
Janet says he Mrs Tebrick and I have had some bad news and Mrs
Tebrick was called away instantly to London and left this afternoon and
I am staying tonight to put our affairs in order We are shutting up
the house and I must give you and Mrs Brant a months wages and ask
you to leave tomorrow morning at seven oclock We shall probably go
away to the Continent and I do not know when we shall come back Please
tell the others and now get me my tea and bring it into my study on a
tray  Janet said nothing for she was a shy girl particularly before
gentlemen but when she entered the kitchen Mr Tebrick heard a sudden
burst of conversation with many exclamations from the cook
When she came back with his tea Mr Tebrick said I shall not require
you upstairs Pack your own things and tell James to have the waggonette
ready for you by seven oclock tomorrow morning to take you to the
station I am busy now but I will see you again before you go
When she had gone Mr Tebrick took the tray upstairs For the first
moment he thought the room was empty and his vixen got away for he
could see no sign of her anywhere But after a moment he saw something
stirring in a corner of the room and then behold she came forth
dragging her dressinggown into which she had somehow struggled
This must surely have been a comical sight but poor Mr Tebrick was
altogether too distressed then or at any time afterwards to divert
himself at such ludicrous scenes He only called to her softly
SilviaSilvia What do you do there And then in a moment saw for
himself what she would be at and began once more to blame himself
heartilybecause he had not guessed that his wife would not like to go
naked notwithstanding the shape she was in Nothing would satisfy
him then till he had clothed her suitably bringing her dresses from the
wardrobe for her to choose But as might have been expected they were
too big for her now but at last he picked out a little dressingjacket
that she was fond of wearing sometimes in the mornings It was made of
a flowered silk trimmed with lace and the sleeves short enough to sit
very well on her now While he tied the ribands his poor lady thanked
him with gentle looks and not without some modesty and confusion He
propped her up in an armchair with some cushions and they took tea
together she very delicately drinking from a saucer and taking bread
and butter from his hands All this showed him or so he thought that
his wife was still herself there was so little wildness in her
demeanour and so much delicacy and decency especially in her not
wishing to run naked that he was very much comforted and began to
fancy they could be happy enough if they could escape the world and live
always alone
From this too sanguine dream he was aroused by hearing the gardener
speaking to the dogs trying to quiet them for ever since he had come
in with his vixen they had been whining barking and growling and all
as he knew because there was a fox within doors and they would kill it
He started up now calling to the gardener that he would come down to
the dogs himself to quiet them and bade the man go indoors again and
leave it to him All this he said in a dry compelling kind of voice
which made the fellow do as he was bid though it was against his will
for he was curious Mr Tebrick went downstairs and taking his gun from
the rack loaded it and went out into the yard Now there were two dogs
one a handsome Irish setter that was his wifes dog she had brought it
with her from Tangley Hall on her marriage the other was an old fox
terrier called Nelly that he had had ten years or more
When he came out into the yard both dogs saluted him by barking and
whining twice as much as they did before the setter jumping up and down
at the end of his chain in a frenzy and Nelly shivering wagging her
tail and looking first at her master and then at the house door where
she could smell the fox right enough
There was a bright moon so that Mr Tebrick could see the dogs as
clearly as could be First he shot his wifes setter dead and then
looked about him for Nelly to give her the other barrel but he could
see her nowhere The bitch was clean gone till looking to see how she
had broken her chain he found her lying hid in the back of her kennel
But that trick did not save her for Mr Tebrick after trying to pull
her out by her chain and finding it uselessshe would not comethrust
the muzzle of his gun into the kennel pressed it into her body and so
shot her Afterwards striking a match he looked in at her to make
certain she was dead Then leaving the dogs as they were chained up
Mr Tebrick went indoors again and found the gardener who had not yet
gone home gave him a months wages in lieu of notice and told him he
had a job for him yetto bury the two dogs and that he should do it
that same night
But by all this going on with so much strangeness and authority on his
part as it seemed to them the servants were much troubled Hearing the
shots while he was out in the yard his wifes old nurse or Nanny ran
up to the bedroom though she had no business there and so opening the
door saw the poor fox dressed in my ladys little jacket lying back in
the cushions and in such a reverie of woe that she heard nothing
Old Nanny though she was not expecting to find her mistress there
having been told that she was gone that afternoon to London knew her
instantly and cried out
Oh my poor precious Oh poor Miss Silvia What dreadful change is
this Then seeing her mistress start and look at her she cried out
But never fear my darling it will all come right your old Nanny
knows you it will all come right in the end
But though she said this she did not care to look again and kept her
eyes turned away so as not to meet the foxy slit ones of her mistress
for that was too much for her So she hurried out soon fearing to be
found there by Mr Tebrick and who knows perhaps shot like the dogs
for knowing the secret
Mr Tebrick had all this time gone about paying off his servants and
shooting his dogs as if he were in a dream Now he fortified himself
with two or three glasses of strong whisky and went to bed taking his
vixen into his arms where he slept soundly Whether she did or not is
more than I or anybody else can say
In the morning when he woke up they had the place to themselves for on
his instructions the servants had all left first thing Janet and the
cook to Oxford where they would try and find new places and Nanny
going back to the cottage near Tangley where her son lived who was the
pigman there
So with that morning there began what was now to be their ordinary life
together He would get up when it was broad day and first thing light
the fire downstairs and cook the breakfast then brush his wife sponge
her with a damp sponge then brush her again in all this using scent
very freely to hide somewhat her rank odour When she was dressed he
carried her downstairs and they had their breakfast together she
sitting up to table with him drinking her saucer of tea and taking her
food from his fingers or at any rate being fed by him She was still
fond of the same food that she had been used to before her
transformation a lightly boiled egg or slice of ham a piece of
buttered toast or two with a little quince and apple jam While I am on
the subject of her food I should say that reading in the encyclopedia
he found that foxes on the Continent are inordinately fond of grapes
and that during the autumn season they abandon their ordinary diet for
them and then grow exceedingly fat and lose their offensive odour
This appetite for grapes is so well confirmed by Aesop and by passages
in the Scriptures that it is strange Mr Tebrick should not have known
it After reading this account he wrote to London for a basket of grapes
to be posted to him twice a week and was rejoiced to find that the
account in the encyclopedia was true in the most important of these
particulars His vixen relished them exceedingly and seemed never to
tire of them so that he increased his order first from one pound to
three pounds and afterwards to five Her odour abated so much by this
means that he came not to notice it at all except sometimes in the
mornings before her toilet What helped most to make living with her
bearable for him was that she understood him perfectlyyes every word
he said and though she was dumb she expressed herself very fluently by
looks and signs though never by the voice
Thus he frequently conversed with her telling her all his thoughts and
hiding nothing from her and this the more readily because he was very
quick to catch her meaning and her answers
Puss Puss he would say to her for calling her that had been a habit
with him always Sweet Puss some men would pity me living alone here
with you after what has happened but I would not change places while
you were living with any man for the whole world Though you are a fox I
would rather live with you than any woman I swear I would and that too
if you were changed to anything But then catching her grave look he
would say Do you think I jest on these things my dear I do not I
swear to you my darling that all my life I will be true to you will
be faithful will respect and reverence you who are my wife And I will
do that not because of any hope that God in His mercy will see fit to
restore your shape but solely because I love you However you may be
changed my love is not
Then anyone seeing them would have sworn that they were lovers so
passionately did each look on the other
Often he would swear to her that the devil might have power to work some
miracles but that he would find it beyond him to change his love for
her
These passionate speeches however they might have struck his wife in an
ordinary way now seemed to be her chief comfort She would come to him
put her paw in his hand and look at him with sparkling eyes shining
with joy and gratitude would pant with eagerness jump at him and lick
his face
Now he had many little things which busied him in the housegetting his
meals setting the room straight making the bed and so forth When he
was doing this housework it was comical to watch his vixen Often she
was as it were beside herself with vexation and distress to see him in
his clumsy way doing what she could have done so much better had she
been able Then forgetful of the decency and the decorum which she had
at first imposed upon herself never to run upon all fours she followed
him everywhere and if he did one thing wrong she stopped him and showed
him the way of it When he had forgot the hour for his meal she would
come and tug his sleeve and tell him as if she spoke Husband are we
to have no luncheon today
This womanliness in her never failed to delight him for it showed she
was still his wife buried as it were in the carcase of a beast but with
a womans soul This encouraged him so much that he debated with himself
whether he should not read aloud to her as he often had done formerly
At last since he could find no reason against it he went to the shelf
and fetched down a volume of the History of Clarissa Harlowe which he
had begun to read aloud to her a few weeks before He opened the volume
where he had left off with Lovelaces letter after he had spent the
night waiting fruitlessly in the copse
Good God
What is now to become of me
My feet benumbed by midnight wanderings through the heaviest dews
that ever fell my wig and my linen dripping with the hoarfrost
dissolving on them
Day but just breaking etc
While he read he was conscious of holding her attention then after a
few pages the story claimed all his so that he read on for about
halfanhour without looking at her When he did so he saw that she was
not listening to him but was watching something with strange eagerness
Such a fixed intent look was on her face that he was alarmed and sought
the cause of it Presently he found that her gaze was fixed on the
movements of her pet dove which was in its cage hanging in the window
He spoke to her but she seemed displeased so he laid Clarissa
Harlowe aside Nor did he ever repeat the experiment of reading to her
Yet that same evening as he happened to be looking through his writing
table drawer with Puss beside him looking over his elbow she spied a
pack of cards and then he was forced to pick them out to please her
then draw them from their case At last trying first one thing then
another he found that what she was after was to play piquet with him
They had some difficulty at first in contriving for her to hold her
cards and then to play them but this was at last overcome by his
stacking them for her on a sloping board after which she could flip
them out very neatly with her claws as she wanted to play them When
they had overcome this trouble they played three games and most
heartily she seemed to enjoy them Moreover she won all three of them
After this they often played a quiet game of piquet together and
cribbage too I should say that in marking the points at cribbage on the
board he always moved her pegs for her as well as his own for she could
not handle them or set them in the holes
The weather which had been damp and misty with frequent downpours of
rain improved very much in the following week and as often happens in
January there were several days with the sun shining no wind and light
frosts at night these frosts becoming more intense as the days went on
till bye and bye they began to think of snow
With this spell of fine weather it was but natural that Mr Tebrick
should think of taking his vixen out of doors This was something he had
not yet done both because of the damp rainy weather up till then and
because the mere notion of taking her out filled him with alarm Indeed
he had so many apprehensions beforehand that at one time he resolved
totally against it For his mind was filled not only with the fear that
she might escape from him and run away which he knew was groundless
but with more rational visions such as wandering curs traps gins
spring guns besides a dread of being seen with her by the
neighbourhood At last however he resolved on it and all the more as
his vixen kept asking him in the gentlest way Might she not go out
into the garden Yet she always listened very submissively when he told
her that he was afraid if they were seen together it would excite the
curiosity of their neighbours besides this he often told her of his
fears for her on account of dogs But one day she answered this by
leading him into the hall and pointing boldly to his gun After this he
resolved to take her though with full precautions That is he left the
house door open so that in case of need she could beat a swift retreat
then he took his gun under his arm and lastly he had her well wrapped
up in a little fur jacket lest she should take cold
He would have carried her too but that she delicately disengaged
herself from his arms and looked at him very expressively to say that
she would go by herself For already her first horror of being seen to
go upon all fours was worn off reasoning no doubt upon it that either
she must resign herself to go that way or else stay bedridden all the
rest of her life
Her joy at going into the garden was inexpressible First she ran this
way then that though keeping always close to him looking very sharply
with ears cocked forward first at one thing then another and then up to
catch his eye
For some time indeed she was almost dancing with delight running round
him then forward a yard or two then back to him and gambolling beside
him as they went round the garden But in spite of her joy she was full
of fear At every noise a cow lowing a cock crowing or a ploughman in
the distance hulloaing to scare the rooks she started her ears pricked
to catch the sound her muzzle wrinkled up and her nose twitched and
she would then press herself against his legs They walked round the
garden and down to the pond where there were ornamental waterfowl teal
widgeon and mandarin ducks and seeing these again gave her great
pleasure They had always been her favourites and now she was so
overjoyed to see them that she behaved with very little of her usual
selfrestraint First she stared at them then bouncing up to her
husbands knee sought to kindle an equal excitement in his mind Whilst
she rested her paws on his knee she turned her head again and again
towards the ducks as though she could not take her eyes off them and
then ran down before him to the waters edge
But her appearance threw the ducks into the utmost degree of
consternation Those on shore or near the bank swam or flew to the
centre of the pond and there huddled in a bunch and then swimming
round and round they began such a quacking that Mr Tebrick was nearly
deafened As I have before said nothing in the ludicrous way that arose
out of the metamorphosis of his wife and such incidents were
plentiful ever stood a chance of being smiled at by him So in this
case too for realising that the silly ducks thought his wife a fox
indeed and were alarmed on that account he found painful that spectacle
which to others might have been amusing
Not so his vixen who appeared if anything more pleased than ever when
she saw in what a commotion she had set them and began cutting a
thousand pretty capers Though at first he called to her to come back
and walk another way Mr Tebrick was overborne by her pleasure and sat
down while she frisked around him happier far than he had seen her ever
since the change First she ran up to him in a laughing way all smiles
and then ran down again to the waters edge and began frisking and
frolicking chasing her own brush dancing on her hind legs even and
rolling on the ground then fell to running in circles but all this
without paying any heed to the ducks
But they with their necks craned out all pointing one way swam to and
fro in the middle of the pond never stopping their quack quack quack
and keeping time too for they all quacked in chorus Presently she came
further away from the pond and he thinking they had had enough of this
sort of entertainment laid hold of her and said to her
Come Silvia my dear it is growing cold and it is time we went
indoors I am sure taking the air has done you a world of good but we
must not linger any more
She appeared then to agree with him though she threw half a glance over
her shoulder at the ducks and they both walked soberly enough towards
the house
When they had gone about halfway she suddenly slipped round and was off
He turned quickly and saw the ducks had been following them
So she drove them before her back into the pond the ducks running in
terror from her with their wings spread and she not pressing them for
he saw that had she been so minded she could have caught two or three of
the nearest Then with her brush waving above her she came gambolling
back to him so playfully that he stroked her indulgently though he was
first vexed and then rather puzzled that his wife should amuse herself
with such pranks
But when they got within doors he picked her up in his arms kissed her
and spoke to her
Silvia what a lighthearted childish creature you are Your courage
under misfortune shall be a lesson to me but I cannot I cannot bear to
see it
Here the tears stood suddenly in his eyes and he lay down upon the
ottoman and wept paying no heed to her until presently he was aroused
by her licking his cheek and his ear
After tea she led him to the drawing room and scratched at the door till
he opened it for this was part of the house which he had shut up
thinking three or four rooms enough for them now and to save the
dusting of it Then it seemed she would have him play to her on the
pianoforte she led him to it nay what is more she would herself pick
out the music he was to play First it was a fugue of Handels then one
of Mendelssohns Songs Without Words and then The Diver and then
music from Gilbert and Sullivan but each piece of music she picked out
was gayer than the last one Thus they sat happily engrossed for perhaps
an hour in the candle light until the extreme cold in that unwarmed room
stopped his playing and drove them downstairs to the fire Thus did she
admirably comfort her husband when he was dispirited
Yet next morning when he woke he was distressed when he found that she
was not in the bed with him but was lying curled up at the foot of it
During breakfast she hardly listened when he spoke and then impatiently
but sat staring at the dove
Mr Tebrick sat silently looking out of window for some time then he
took out his pocket book in it there was a photograph of his wife taken
soon after their wedding Now he gazed and gazed upon those familiar
features and now he lifted his head and looked at the animal before
him He laughed then bitterly the first and last time for that matter
that Mr Tebrick ever laughed at his wifes transformation for he was
not very humorous But this laugh was sour and painful to him Then he
tore up the photograph into little pieces and scattered them out of the
window saying to himself Memories will not help me here and turning
to the vixen he saw that she was still staring at the caged bird and
as he looked he saw her lick her chops
He took the bird into the next room then acting suddenly upon the
impulse he opened the cage door and set it free saying as he did so
Go poor bird Fly from this wretched house while you still remember
your mistress who fed you from her coral lips You are not a fit
plaything for her now Farewell poor bird Farewell Unless he added
with a melancholy smile you return with good tidings like Noahs
dove
But poor gentleman his troubles were not over yet and indeed one may
say that he ran to meet them by his constant supposing that his lady
should still be the same to a tittle in her behaviour now that she was
changed into a fox
Without making any unwarrantable suppositions as to her soul or what had
now become of it though we could find a good deal to the purpose on
that point in the system of Paracelsus let us consider only how much
the change in her body must needs affect her ordinary conduct So that
before we judge too harshly of this unfortunate lady we must reflect
upon the physical necessities and infirmities and appetites of her new
condition and we must magnify the fortitude of her mind which enabled
her to behave with decorum cleanliness and decency in spite of her new
situation
Thus she might have been expected to befoul her room yet never could
anyone whether man or beast have shown more nicety in such matters
But at luncheon Mr Tebrick helped her to a wing of chicken and leaving
the room for a minute to fetch some water which he had forgot found her
at his return on the table crunching the very bones He stood silent
dismayed and wounded to the heart at this sight For we must observe
that this unfortunate husband thought always of his vixen as that gentle
and delicate woman she had lately been So that whenever his vixens
conduct went beyond that which he expected in his wife he was as it
were cut to the quick and no kind of agony could be greater to him
than to see her thus forget herself On this account it may indeed be
regretted that Mrs Tebrick had been so exactly wellbred and in
particular that her table manners had always been scrupulous Had she
been in the habit like a continental princess I have dined with of
taking her leg of chicken by the drumstick and gnawing the flesh it had
been far better for him now But as her manners had been perfect so the
lapse of them was proportionately painful to him Thus in this instance
he stood as it were in silent agony till she had finished her hideous
crunching of the chicken bones and had devoured every scrap Then he
spoke to her gently taking her on to his knee stroking her fur and fed
her with a few grapes saying to her
Silvia Silvia is it so hard for you Try and remember the past my
darling and by living with me we will quite forget that you are no
longer a woman Surely this affliction will pass soon as suddenly as
it came and it will all seem to us like an evil dream
Yet though she appeared perfectly sensible of his words and gave him
sorrowful and penitent looks like her old self that same afternoon on
taking her out he had all the difficulty in the world to keep her from
going near the ducks
There came to him then a thought that was very disagreeable to him
