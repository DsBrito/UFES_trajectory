unimposinglooking man sat at a desk marked MR MEREDITHACCOUNTING
DEPT He looked as though he were paying no attention whatever to
anything going on at the various windows but he too had a microphone
at his throat and a hidden pickup in his ear
At Houstons question he whispered Thats Sir Lewis Huntley The
checks good of course Poor fellow
Yeah whispered Houston if he is what we think he is
Im fairly certain Meredith replied Sir Lewis isnt the type of
fellow to draw that much in cash At the present rate of exchange
thats worth three thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars American
Sir Lewis might carry a hundred pounds as pocketmoney but never a
thousand
Houston and Meredith were a good thirty feet from each other and
neither looked at the other Unless a bystander had equipment to tune in
on the special scrambled wavelength they were using that bystander
would never know they were holding a conversation
ninefifty ninesixty nineseventy nineeighty nineninety a
thousand pounds said the clerk who was taking care of Sir Lewiss
check Would you count that to make sure sir
Certainly Ten twenty thirty
While the baronet was doublechecking the amount David Houston glanced
at him Sir Lewis looked perfectly calm and unhurried as though he were
doing something perfectly legalwhich in a way he was And in
another way he most definitely was not if George Merediths suspicions
were correct
Your receipt sir It was the teller at Houstons own window
Houston took the receipt thanked the teller and walked toward the
broad front doors of the bank
George he whispered into the throat mike has Sir Lewis noticed me
Hasnt so much as looked at you Meredith answered Good hunting
Thanks
As Houston stepped outside the bank he casually dropped one hand into a
coat pocket and turned a small knob on his radio control box Houston
to HQ he whispered
London HQ what is it Houston asked the earpiece
Leadenhall Street Post Meredith thinks hes spotted one Sir Lewis
Huntley
Righto Weve got men in that part of the city now Well have a
network posted within five minutes Can you hold onto him that long
Houston looked around Leadenhall Street was full of people and the
visibility was low Ill have to tail him pretty closely Houston
said Your damned English fogs dont give a man much chance to see
anything
There was a chuckle from the earphone Cheer up Yank you should have
seen it back before 1968 When atomic power replaced coal and oil our
fogs became a devil of a lot cleaner
The voice was quite clear at the London headquarters of the UN
Psychodeviant Police there was no need to wear a throat mike which had
a tendency to make the voice sound muffled in spite of the Statistical
InformationBit Samplers which were supposed to clarify the speech
coming through them
What do you know about 1968 Houston asked sardonically Your mother
was still pushing you around in a babycarriage then
In a pram corrected the Headquarters operator That is true but my
dear Aunt Jennifer told me all about it She was
The hell with your Aunt Jennifer Houston interrupted suddenly Here
comes Sir Lewis Get me coverfast
Right Keep us posted
Sir Lewis Huntley stepped out of the broad door of the bank and turned
left He took a couple of steps and stopped He didnt look around he
simply took a cigarette out of a silver case put it in his mouth and
lit it The glow of the lighter shone yellowly on the brass plate near
the door which said An Affiliate of Westminster Bank Ltd
Sir Lewis snapped the light out drew on the cigarette and strode on
down the street swinging a blue plastex brief case which contained a
thousand pounds in United Nations Bank of England notes
Houston decided the baronet had not been looking for a tail he wished
he could probe the mans mind to make sure but he knew that would be
fatal Hed have to play the game and hope for the best
Hes heading east Houston whispered Doesnt look as if hes going
to get a cab
Check said the earphone
Sir Lewis seemed in no great hurry but he walked briskly as though he
had a definite destination in mind
After a little way he crossed to the south side of Leadenhall Street
and kept going east Houston stayed far enough behind to be above
suspicion but not so far that he ran a chance of losing his man
Hes turning south on Fenchurch Houston said a little later I
wonder where hes going
Keep after him said Headquarters Our net men havent spotted either
of you yet They can hardly see across the street in this damned fog
Houston kept going
What the hell he whispered a few minutes later Hes still following
Fenchurch Street Hes doubling back
Leadenhall Street the banking center of the City of London runs almost
due eastandwest Fenchurch Street makes a fortyfive degree angle with
it at the western end running southwest for a bit and then curving
toward the west toward Lombard
Houston said HQ touch your left ear
Houston obediently reached up and scratched his left ear
Okay said HQ Bogarts spotted you but he hasnt spotted Sir Lewis
Bogarts across the street
He cant miss Sir Lewis whispered Houston Conservatively
dressedmatching coat and trousers of orange nylon tweedroyal blue
halfbrim bowlercarrying a blue brief case
There was a pause then Yeah Bogarts spotted him and so has
MacGruder Macs on your side a few yards ahead
Check How about the rest of the net
Coming coming Be patient old man
I am patient growled Houston I have to be he thought to
himself otherwise Id never stay alive
Weve got him bracketed now HQ said If we lose him now hes a
magician
Sir Lewis walked on seemingly oblivious to the group of men who had
surrounded him He came to the end of Fenchurch Street and looked to his
left towards London Bridge Then he glanced to his right
I think hes looking for a cab Houston whispered
Thats what MacGruder says came the reply Weve got Arthmore in a
cab behind you hell pick you up MacGruder will get another cab and
we have a private car for Bogart
Sir Lewis flagged a cab climbed in and gave an address to the driver
Houston didnt hear it but MacGruder a heavyset short balding man
was standing near enough to get the instructions Sir Lewis had given to
the driver
A cab pulled up to the curb near Houston and he got in
Arthmore the driver was a thin tall hawknosed individual who could
have played Sherlock Holmes on TV Once he got into character for a
part he never got out of it unless absolutely necessary Right now he
was a Cockney cabdriver and he would play the part to the hilt
Where to guvnor he asked innocently
Buckingham Palace said Houston Ive got a poker appointment with
Prince Charles
Blimey guvnor said Arthmore You are movin in igh circles
Ows Er Majesty these days
The turboelectric motor hummed and the cab shot off into traffic
According to the report I get on the blinkin wireless he continued
a chap named MacGruder claims that the eminent Sir Lewis Untley is
eaded for Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews
One of these days said Houston all those Hs you drop is going to
bounce back and hit you in the face
Beg pardon Mr Yewston Arthmore asked blankly
Houston grinned Nothing cabbie its just that you remind me of a
cultured intelligent fellow named Jack Arthmore The only difference is
that Jack speaks the Queens English
Crikey said Arthmore Wot a coincidence He paused then The
Queens English you say She as to be dont she
Shut up said Houston conversationally And give me a cigarette he
added
Theres a package of Players in my shirt pocket Arthmore said
keeping his hands on the wheel
Houston fished out a cigarette lit it and returned the pack
Apropos of nothing Arthmore said Reminds me of the time I was workin
for a printer see We ad to print up a bunch of andbills advertisin
a church charity bazaar Down at the bottom was supposed to be printed
Under the auspices of St BedesonThames So I
He went on with a long rambling tale about making a mistake in printing
the handbill Houston paid little attention He smoked in silence
keeping his eyes on the red glow of the taillight ahead of them
Neither man mentioned the approaching climax of the chase Even hardened
veterans of the Psychodeviant Police dont look forward to the
possibility of having their minds taken over controlled by some outside
force
It had never happened to Houston but he knew that Arthmore had been
through the experience once It evidently wasnt pleasant
and the boss was oppin mad Arthmore was saying but crikey ow
was I to know that auspice was spelled AUSPICE
Houston grinned Yeah sure Howre we doing with Sir Lewis
Seems to be headed in the right direction Arthmore said suddenly
dropping the Cockney accent This is the route Id take if I were
headed for Upper Berkeley Mews He probably hasnt told the driver to
change addressesmaybe he wont
The victims never do Houston said He probably is actually headed
toward Number 37 Upper Berkeley Mews
Yeah Nobodys perfect said Arthmore
Fortyfive minutes of steady progress through the streets of Greater
London brought Sir Lewis Huntley to Upper Berkeley and to the short
deadend street which constituted the Mews By the time the dapper
baronet stepped out of the machine and paid his driver the whole area
was surrounded by and filled with the wellarmed silent and careful
agents of the Psychodeviant Police
Number 37 was an old concreteandsteel structure of the George VI
period faced with a veneer of red brick It had obviously been
remodeled at least once to make the facade more modern and more
fashionable the redviolet anodized aluminum was relatively fresh and
unstained It wouldnt have taken vast wealth to rent a flat in the
building but neither would an average income have been quite enough
Houston looked out of the window of Arthmores cab and glanced at the
tiers of windows in the building Presumably the man they were looking
for was up theresomewhere
So you occupy a station in the upper middleclass thought Houston It
checked Every bit of evidence that came his way seemed to check
perfectly and fit neatly into the hypothesis which he had formed Soon
it would be time to test that theorybut the time had not yet come
Stand by and wait for orders Houston said the speaker in Houstons
ear Weve got men inside the building
Sir Lewis Huntley opened the sparkling translucent door of Number 37
Upper Berkeley Mews and went inside
Arthmore pulled the cab over to the curb a few yards from the entrance
and the two men waited in silence All around them were other men some
in private cars some walking slowly along the street All of them were
part of the net that had gathered to catch one man
Poor fish Houston thought wryly
There was no noise no excitement Five minutes after Sir Lewis had
entered the front door it opened again A man whom Houston had never
seen before stepped out and gestured with one hand At the same time
Houstons speaker said Theyve got him Hit him with a stun gun when
he tried to get out through the fire exit
An ambulance which had been waiting at the entrance of the Mews pulled
up in front of Number 37 and a minute or so later a little clot of men
came out bearing a stretcher which was loaded into the ambulance
Immediately after them came another man who had a firm but polite grip
on the arm of Sir Lewis Huntley
Houston sighed and leaned back in his seat That was that It was all
over Simple Nothing to it
Another Controller had been apprehended by the Psychodeviant Police
Another deviant already tried and found guilty was ready to be exiled
from Earth and imprisoned on one of the Penal Asteroids All in the
days work
Theres just one thing Id like to know Houston thought blackly
What in the hells going on
In his hotel room near Piccadilly Circus several hours later David
Houston sat alone drink in hand and put that same question to himself
again
Whats going on
On the face of it it was simple On the face of it the answer was
right in front of him printed in black and white on the front page of
the evening Times
Houston lifted the paper off the bed and looked at it The banner line
said Controller Captured in Lambeth
Beneath that in smaller type the headline added Robert Harris Accused
of Taking Control of Barrister Sir Lewis Huntley
The column itself told the whole story Mr Robert Harris of No 37
Upper Berkeley Mews had by means of mental control taken over the
mind of Sir Lewis and compelled him to draw one thousand pounds out of
his bank While Sir Lewis was returning to Harris with the money the
United Nations Psychodeviant Police had laid a trap Sir Lewis upon
recovering his senses when Harris was rendered unconscious by a stun
gun had given evidence to the PD Police and to officials at New
Scotland Yard
Houston looked at the fullcolor photo of Harris that was printed
alongside the column Nicelooking chap late twenties or early
thirties Houston guessed Blondred hair blue eyes Allinall a
very pleasant but ordinary sort of man
There had been evidence that a Controller had been at work in London for
some weeks now Twelve days before several men following an impulse
had mailed twenty pounds to a Richard Hempstead General Delivery
Waterloo Station By the time the matter had come to the authorities
attention the envelopes had been called for and the Controller had
escaped
Robert Harris was not the first Controller to be captured nor Houston
knew would he be the last The first one had shown up more than sixteen
years before in Dallas Texas USA
Houston grinned as he thought of it Projective telepathy had only been
a crackpots idea back then In spite of the work of many intelligent
sane men who had shown that mental powers above and beyond the ordinary
did exist the average man simply laughed off such nonsense It was
mysticism it was magic it was foolish superstition It was anything
but true
But ever since Blackjack Donnely had practically taken control of the
whole city of Dallas the average man had changed his mind It was still
mysterious it was still magic but now the weird machinations of the
supernormal mind were something to be feared
In the sixteen years that had ensued since the discovery of the abnormal
mental powers of Blackjack Donnely rumors had spread all over the
world There were supposed to be men who could levitatefly through the
air at will Others could walk through walls and still others could
make themselves invisible The horrible monsters that were supposed to
be walking the Earth were legion
Actually only one type of supernormal psychodeviant had been foundthe
telepath the mindreader who could probe into the mental processes of
others Worse than that the telepath could project his own thoughts
into the mind of another so that the victim supposed that the thoughts
were his own Actually it was a highpowered form of hypnotism the
victim could be made to do anything the projective telepath wanted him
to
Blackjack Donnely had made that clear in his trial in Texas
Donnely had been a big manbig physically and important in city
politics He had also been as arrogant as the Devil himself
It was the arrogance that had finally tripped up Donnely He had thought
himself impregnable Haled into court on charges of misappropriation of
public funds he had just sat and smirked while several witnesses for
the State admitted that they had aided Donnely but they claimed he had
hypnotized them Donnely didnt try to interfere with the
evidencethats where he made his mistake And thats where his
arrogance tripped him up
If hed used telepathic projection to influence the State Attorney or
the witnesses or the judge or the Grand Jury before the trial he
might never have been discovered as the first of the Controllers But
that wasnt Donnelys style
None of this nambypamby stuff he had once been quoted as saying if
you got enemies dont tease emshow em whos running things
Blackjack em if you have to
And thats exactly what Blackjack Donnely had done The trial was a
farce from beginning to end each witness gave his evidence from the
stand and then Donnely took control of their minds and made them refute
every bit of it publicly and tearfully apologizing to the wonderful
Mr Donnely for saying such unkind things about him
The judge and the jury knew something funny was going on but they had
no evidence one way or another The case even at that point might
have ended with an acquittal or a hung jury but Donnely wasnt through
using his blackjack
He took over the mind of the foreman of the jury The foreman claimed
later that the jury had decided that they could reach no decision Other
jurors claimed that they had decided Donnely was guilty but that was
probably an ex post facto switch It didnt matter anyway when the
foreman came out he pronounced Donnely innocent That should have ended
it
The other jurors began to protest but by that time Donnely had gained
control of the judges mind Rapidly the judge silenced the jurors
declared Donnely to be free and then publicly apologized for ever
daring to doubt Mr Donnely
The States Attorney was equally verbose in his apology he was almost
in tears because of his deep contrition at having cast aspersions on
the spotless character of so great a man
Donnely was released
The next evening Blackjack Donnely was shot down at the front door of
his own home There were fifteen bullets in his body three from a 32
five from a 38 and seven from a 45
The police investigation was far from thorough any evidence that may
have turned up somehow got lost It was labelled as homicide committed
by person or persons unknown and it stayed that way
Donnely was only the first In the next two years four more showed up
Everyone of them in one way or another had attempted to gain power or
money by mental projection Everyone of them was a twisted megalomaniac
Houston looked again at Harriss picture on the front page of the
Times Here was one Controller who neither looked nor acted like a
megalomaniac That wouldnt make much difference to the PD Police as
far as the officials were concerned the ability to project
telepathically and the taint of delusions of grandeur went hand in hand
Controllers were powermad and criminal by definition
Fear still ruled the emotional reactions against Controllers in spite
of the protection of the Psychodeviant Police
But David Houston knew damned good and well that all telepaths were not
necessarily insane
He should know He was a Controller himself
Brrrring
David Houston tossed the paper on the bed and walked over to the phone
He cut in the circuit and waited for the phones TV screen to show the
face of his caller But the screen remained blank
Who is it Houston asked
Is this CHAring Cross 78161 It was a womans voice soft and
wellmodulated
No this is CHElsea 78161 Houston said You must have dialed CHE
instead of CHA
Oh Im very sorry Excuse me There was a click and she hung up
Houston walked back over to the bed and picked up his paper He looked
at it but he didnt read it It no longer interested him
So Dorrine was finally in London eh Hed recognized her voice
instantly even years of training couldnt smother the midwestern
American of Chicago completely beneath the precise British of the
welleducated English girl
The signal had been agreed upon just in case his phone was tapped Even
the Psychodeviant Police could be suspected of harboring a
Controlleralthough Houston didnt think it too likely Nevertheless
he wasnt one to take too many chances
He glanced at his watch He had an hour yet Hed wait five minutes
before he phoned headquarters
He sat down in his chair again and forced himself to relax smoke a
cigarette and read the paperthe sports section Perusing the records
of the seasons cricket matches kept his mind off that picture on the
front page At least he hoped they would Lets see nowBenton was
being rated as the finest googly bowler on the Staffordshire Club
Everything went fine until he came across a reference to a John Harris
a topflight batsman for Hambledon that reminded him of Robert Harris
Houston threw down the paper in disgust and walked over to the phone
The number was TROwbridge 54321 but no one ever bothered to remember
it Simply dial 87654321 and every time a voice at the other end
would answer
Hamilton speaking
Houston here will I be needed in the next hour or so
Mmmm Just a second Ill check the roster No your evidence wont be
needed personally Youve filed an affidavit No I dont thinkwait a
minute Yes theres a return here for you reservation on the six AM
jet to New York Your job here is done Houston so you can take the
rest of the evening off and relax Going anywhere in particular
I thought Id get a bite to eat and take in a movie maybe but if Im
due out at six Ill forego the cinematic diversion Whens the trial
Its scheduled for eleventhirty this evening Going to come
Houston shook his head Not if Im not needed to give evidence Those
Controllers always give me the creeps
They do everybody said Hamilton Well you caught him theres no
need for you to stick around for the windup Have a good time
Thanks said Houston shortly and hung up
The windup Houston thought Sure Thats all it will be A
Controllers trial is a farce Knock him out with a stun gun and then
pump him full of comatol How can he defend himself if hes unconscious
all through the trial
Houston knew what the average mans answer to that would be If a
Controller were allowed to remain conscious hed take over the judges
mind and get himself freed
Houston said an obscene word under his breath jammed his hat on his
head put on his coat and left his apartment
With the coming of darkness the heavy fog had become still denser The
yellow beams of the sodium vapor lamps were simply golden spots hanging
in an allenveloping blackness Walking the street was a process of
moving from one little golden island of light to another crossing seas
of blankness between The monochromatic yellow shone on the human faces
that passed beneath the lamps robbing them of all color giving them a
dead grayish appearance beneath the yellow itself
David Houston walked purposefully along the pavement his hand jammed
deep in his overcoat pockets One hand held the control box for the
little earpiece he wore He kept moving the band selector listening for
any sign that the Psychodeviant Police were suspicious of a Controller
in their midst
If they were following him of course they would use a different
scrambler circuit than the one which was plugged into his own unit but
he would be able to hear the gabble of voices even if he couldnt
understand what they were saying
So far there hadnt been a sound if he was being followed his tailers
werent using the personal intercom units
He didnt try to elude anyone who might be following That in itself
would be a giveaway Let them watch if they were watching They
wouldnt see anything but a man going to get himself a bit of dinner
The Charles II Inn on Regent Street near Piccadilly Circus was a
haven of brightness in an otherwise Stygian London It was one of those
oldfashioned placesRestoration style of decoration carried out in
modern plastics The oak panelling looked authentic enough but it was
just a little too glossy to be real
Houston pushed open the door stepped inside removed his hat and coat
and shook the dampness from them As he handed them to the checker he
looked casually around Dorrine was nowhere in sight but he hadnt
expected her to be There would be no point in their meeting physically
it might even be downright dangerous
The headwaiter clad in the long waistcoat and full trunkhose of the
late Seventeenth Century bowed punctiliously
Youre alone sir
Alone yes Houston said Ill just be wanting a light supper and a
drink or two
This way sir
Houston followed the man to a small table in the rear of the huge dining
room It was set for two but the other place was quickly cleared away
Houston ordered an Irishandsoda from a waiter who was only slightly
less elaborately dressed than the headwaiter and then settled himself
down to wait If he knew Dorrine she would be on time to the minute
She came while the waiter was setting the drink on Houstons table She
stepped in through the door her unmistakable hair glowing a rich red in
the illumination of the pseudocandlelight
She didnt bother to look around she knew he would be there
After a single glance Houston averted his eyes from her and looked back
at his drink
And in that same instant their minds touched
Dave darling I knew youd be early
Dorrine
And then their minds meshed for an instant
IweyouLOVEyoueach othermeus
Houston looked complacently at his drink while the headwaiter led
Dorrine to a table on the far side of the room She sat down gracefully
smiled at the waiter and ordered a cocktail Then she took a magazine
from her handbag and beganpresumablyto read
Her thought came Who is this Richard Harris Hes not one of our
Group
Houston sipped at his drink No An unknown like the others I wonder
if hes even a telepath
What Her thought carried astonishment Why Davehed have to be
How else could he have controlled this Sir LewiswhatsisnameHuntley
WellIve got a funny idea Houston replied Look at it this way So
far as we know there are two Groups of telepaths Theres our own
Group All we want is to be left alone We dont read a Normals mind
unless we have to and we dont try to control one unless our lives are
threatened We stay under cover out of everyones way
Then there are the megalomaniacs They try presumably to gain wealth
and power by controlling Normals And they get caught with monotonous
regularity Right
The girl caught an odd note in that thought What do you mean
monotonous regularity she asked
I mean Houston thought savagely why is it theyre all so bloody
stupid Look at this Harris guy he is supposed to have taken over Sir
Lewiss mind in order to get a thousand pounds So what did he have Sir
Lewis do Parade all around the city to pick up a PD Police net and
then give his address to a cabman in a loud voice and lead the whole
net right to Harris How stupid can a man get
It does look pretty silly Dorrine agreed Have you got an
explanation
Several Houston told her And I dont know which one is correct
Lets have them the girl thought
Houston gave them to her None of them he knew was completely
satisfactory but they all made more sense that the theory that Harris
had done what the PD Police claimed hed done
Theory Number One The real megalomaniac Controller had taken over Sir
Lewiss mind and made him draw out the thousand pounds and head west on
Leadenhall Street Somehow the Controller had found out that Sir Lewis
was being followed and had steered him away from the original
destination heading him toward the innocent Robert Harris That implied
that the Controller had been within a few dozen yards of the net men
that afternoon A Controller cant control a mind directly from a
distance although orders can be implanted which will cause a man to
carry out a plan of action even though he may be miles from the
Controller But in order to change those plans the Controller would
have to be within projection range
Theory Two Robert Harris actually was a megalomaniac Controller with a
long record of success behind him who had finally grown careless
At that point Dorrine interjected a thought Isnt it possible that he
wanted to be caught
Houston mulled it over for a minute A guiltpunishment reaction He
wanted to be punished for his crimes I suppose that might account for
part of it yes But if hed been so successful what did he do with all
his money
Dorrine gave a mental shrug Who knows Whats Theory Number Three
Number Three was the screwiest one of all yet it made a weird kind of
sense Suppose that Sir Lewis himself had had a grudge against Harris
The whole thing would have been ridiculously easy all hed have to do
would be to act just as he had acted and then give evidence against
Harris
The thing that made it odd wasnt the actual frameup if thats what it
was these days every crime was blamed on a Controller A man accused
of murder simply looked virtuous and said that he would never have done
such a thing if he hadnt been under the power of a Controller Ditto
for robbery rape and any other felony youd care to name
An aura of fear hung over the whole Earth each man half suspected
everyone with whom he came in contact of being a Controller
