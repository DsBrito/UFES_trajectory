THE SUNDERING FLOOD
Chapter I Of a River Called the Sundering Flood and of the Folk that
Dwelt Thereby
It is told that there was once a mighty river which ran south into the
sea and at the mouth thereof was a great and rich city which had
been builded and had waxed and thriven because of the great and most
excellent haven which the river aforesaid made where it fell into the
sea And now it was like looking at a huge wood of barked and
smoothened firtrees when one saw the masts of the ships that lay in
the said haven
But up in this river ran the flood of tide a long way so that the
biggest of dromonds and roundships might fare up it and oft they lay
amid pleasant upcountry places with their yards all but touching the
windows of the husbandmans stead and their bowsprits thrusting forth
amongst the middens and the routing swine and querulous hens And
the uneasy lads and lasses sitting at highmass of the Sunday in the
grey church would see the tall masts amidst the painted saints of the
aisle windows and their minds would wander from the masshackled
priest and the words and the gestures of him and see visions of far
countries and outlandish folk and some would be heartsmitten with
that desire of wandering and looking on new things which so oft the
seabeat board and the windstrained pine bear with them to the
dwellings of the stayathomes and to some it seemed as if when they
went from out the church they should fall in with St Thomas of India
stepping over the gangway and come to visit their uplandish Christmas
and the Yulefeast of the fieldabiders of midwinter frost And
moreover when the tide failed and there was no longer a flood to
bear the seagoing keels upstream and that was hard on an hundred of
miles from the sea yet was this great river a noble and
widespreading water and the downlong stream thereof not so heavy nor
so fierce but that the barges and lesser keels might well spread their
sails when the southwest blew and fare on without beating or if the
wind were fouler for them they that were loth to reach from shore to
shore might be tracked up by the draught of horses and bullocks and
bear the wares of the merchants to many a cheaping
Other rivers moreover not a few fell into this main flood and of the
some were no lesser than the Thames is at Abingdon where I who
gathered this tale dwell in the House of the Black Canons blessed be
St William and St Richard and the Holy Austin our candle in the
dark Yea and some were even bigger so that the land was well
furnished both of fisheries and waterways
Now the name of this river was the Sundering Flood and the city at
the mouth thereof was called the City of the Sundering Flood And it
is no wonder considering all that I have told concerning the wares
and chaffer that it bore upcountry though the folk of the City and
its lands and the cityfolk in special knew no cause for this name
Nay oft they jested and gibed and gabbed for they loved their river
much and were proud of it wherefore they said it was no sunderer but
a uniter that it joined land to land and shore to shore that it had
peopled the wilderness and made the waste places blossom and that no
highway for wheels and beasts in all the land was so full of blessings
and joys as was their own wet Highway of the Flood Nevertheless as
meseemeth that no name is given to any town or mountain or river
causeless but that men are moved to name all steads for a remembrance
of deeds that have been done and tidings that have befallen or some
due cause even so might it well be with the Sundering Flood and
whereas also I wot something of that cause I shall now presently show
you the same
For ye must know that all this welfare of the said mighty river was
during that while that it flowed through the plain country anigh the
city or the fertile pastures and acres of hill and dale and down
further to the north But one who should follow it up further and
further would reach at last the place where it came forth from the
mountains There though it be far smaller than lower down yet is it
still a mighty great water and it is then well two hundred miles from
the main sea Now from the mountains it cometh in three great forces
and many smaller ones and perilous and awful it is to behold for
betwixt those forces it filleth all the mountain ghyll and there is
no foothold for man nay for goat save at a hundred foot or more
above the water and that evil and perilous and is the running of a
winter millstream to the beetles and shrewmice that haunt the
greensward beside it so is the running of that flood to the sons of
Adam and the beasts that serve them and none has been so bold as to
strive to cast a bridge across it
But when ye have journeyed with much toil and no little peril over the
mountainnecks for by the gorge of the river as aforesaid no man
may go and have come out of the mountains once more then again ye
have the flood before you cleaving a great waste of rocks mingled
with sand where groweth neither tree nor bush nor grass and now the
flood floweth wide and shallow but swift so that no words may tell of
its swiftness and on either side the water are great wastes of
tumbled stones that the spates have borne down from the higher ground
And ye shall know that from this place upward to its very wells in the
higher mountains the flood decreaseth not much in body or might
though it be wider or narrower as it is shallower or deeper for
nought but mere trickles of water fall into it in the space of this
sandy waste and what feeding it hath is from the bents and hills on
either side as you wend toward the mountains to the north where as
aforesaid are its chiefest wells
Now when ye have journeyed over this waste for some sixty miles the
land begins to better and there is grass again yet no trees and it
rises into bents which go back on each side east and west from the
Flood and the said bents are grass also up to the tops where they
are crested with sheer rocks black of colour As for the Flood itself
it is now gathered into straiter compass and is deep and exceeding
strong high banks it hath on either side thereof of twenty foot and
upward of black rock going down sheer to the water and thus it is for
a long way save that the banks be higher and higher as the great
valley of the river rises toward the northern mountains
But as it rises the land betters yet and is well grassed and in
divers nooks and crannies groweth small wood of birch and whiles of
quicken tree but ever the best of the grass waxeth nigh unto the lips
of the Sundering Flood where it rises a little from the Dale to the
water and what little acreland there is and it is but little is up
on knolls that lie nearer to the bent and be turned somewhat
southward or on the east side of the Flood which runneth here nigh
due north to south on the bentside itself where as it windeth and
turneth certain slopes lie turned to southwest And in these places
be a few garths fenced against the deer wherein grow rye and some
little barley whereof to make malt for beer and ale whereas the folk
of this highup windy valley may have no comfort of wine And it is to
be said that ever is that land better and the getting more on the east
side of the Sundering Flood than on the west
As to the folk of this land they are but few even now and belike
were fewer yet in the time of my tale There was no great man amongst
them neither King nor Earl nor Alderman and it had been hard
living for a strongthief in the Dale Yet folk there were both on the
east side and the west of the Flood On neither side were they utterly
cut off from the world outside the Dale for though it were toilsome
it was not perilous to climb the bents and so wend over the necks east
and west where some forty miles from the west bank and fifty from the
east you might come down into a valley fairly well peopled wherein
were two or three cheapingtowns and to these towns the dalesmen had
some resort that they might sell such of their wool as they needed
not to weave for themselves and other small chaffer so that they
might buy wrought wares such as cutlery and pots and above all boards
and timber whereof they had nought at home
But this you must wot and understand that howsoever the Sundering
Flood might be misnamed down below up in the Dale and down away to
the southern mountains it was such that better named it might not be
and that nought might cross its waters undrowned save the fowl flying
Nay and if one went upstream to where it welled forth from the great
mountains he were no nearer to passing from one side to the other
for there would be nought before him but a wall of sheer rock and
above that rent and tumbled crags the safe stronghouses of erne and
osprey and gerfalcon Wherefore all the dealings which the folk on the
east Dale and the west might have with each other was but shouting and
crying across the swirling and gurgling eddies of the black water
which themselves the while seemed to be talking together in some dread
and unknown tongue
True it is that on certain feast days and above all on Midsummer
night the folk would pluck up a heart and gather together as gaily
clad as might be where the Flood was the narrowest save at one place
whereof more hereafter and there on each side would trundle the
firewheel and do other Midsummer games and make music of
stringplay and horns and sing songs of old time and drink to each
other and depart at last to their own homes blessing each other But
never might any man on the east touch the hand of any on the west
save it were that by some strange wandering from the cheapingtowns
aforesaid they might meet at last far and far off from the Dale of
the Sundering Flood
Chapter II Of Wethermel and the Child Osberne
Draw we nigher now to the heart of our tale and tell how on the east
side of the Sundering Flood was erewhile a stead hight Wethermel a
stead more lonely than most even in that Dale the last house but one
and that was but a cot toward the mountains at the head of the Dale
It was not ill set down for its houses stood beneath a low spreading
knoll the broader side whereof was turned to the southwest and
where by consequence was good increase of corn year by year The said
knoll of Wethermel was amidst of the plain of the Dale a mile from the
waterside and all round about it the pasture was good for kine and
horses and sheep all to the waters lip on the west and half way up
the bent on the east while towards the crown of the bent was a wood
of bushes good for firewood and charcoal and even beyond the crown of
the bent was good sheepland a long way
Nevertheless though its land was fruitful as for that country yet
had Wethermel no great name for luck and folk who had the choice
would liever dwell otherwhere so that it was hard for the goodman to
get men to work there for hire Many folk deemed that this illluck
came because the knoll had been of old time a dwelling of the Dwarfs
or the Landwights and that they grudged it that the children of Adam
had supplanted them and that corn grew on the very roof of their
ancient house But however that might be there was little thriving
there for the most part and at least it was noted by some that if
there were any good hap it ever missed one generation and went not
from father to son but from grandsire to grandson and even so it was
now at the beginning of this tale
For he who had been master of Wethermel had died a young man and his
wife followed him in a month or two and there was left in the house
but the father and mother of these twain hale and stout folk he of
fifty winters she of fortyfive an old woman of seventy a kinswoman
of the house who had fostered the late goodman and a little lad who
had to name Osberne now twelve winters old a child strong and bold
tall bright and beauteous These four were all the folk of Wethermel
save now and then a hired man who was hard pressed for livelihood
would be got to abide there some six months or so It must be told
further that there was no house within ten miles either up or down the
water on that side save the little cot abovesaid nigher to the
mountains and that was four miles upstream it hight Burcot and was
somewhat kenspeckle Withal as to those Cloven Motes as they were
called which were between the folk on either side they were holden
at a stead seven miles below Wethermel So that in all wise was it a
lonely and scantlymanned abode and because of this every man on the
stead must work somewhat hard and long day by day and even Osberne
the little lad must do his share and up to this time we tell of his
work was chiefly about the houses or else it was on the knoll or
round about it scaring fowl from the corn weeding the acreground
or tending the old horses that fed near the garth or gooseherding at
whiles Forsooth the two elders who loved and treasured the little
carle exceedingly were loth to trust him far out of sight because of
his bold heart and wilful spirit and there were perils in the Dale
and in special at that rough and wild end of thereof though they came
not from weaponed reivers for the more part though now and again some
desperate outcast from the thicker peopled lands had strayed into it
and there was talk from time to time of outlaws who lay out over the
mountainnecks and might not always do to lack a sheep or a neat or a
horse Other perils more of everyday there were for a young child as
the deep and hurrying stream of the Sundering Flood and the wolves
which haunted the bent and the foothills of the mountains and ever
moreover there was the peril from creatures seldom seen Dwarfs and
Landwights to wit who as all tales told might be well pleased to
have away into their realm so fair a child of the sons of Adam as was
this Osberne
Forsooth for the most part the lad kept within bounds for loves sake
rather than fear though he wotted well that beating abode
boundbreaking but ye may well wot that this quietness might not
always be And one while amongst others he was missing for long and
when his grandsire sought him he found him at last half way between
grass and water above the fierce swirling stream of the river for he
had clomb down the sheer rock of the bank which all along the water
is fashioned into staves as it were organpipes but here and there
broken by I wot not what mighty power There then was my lad in an
inglenook of the rock and not able either to go down or come up
till the goodman let a rope down to him and hauled him on to the
grass
Belike he was a little cowed by the peril and the beating he got for
putting his folk in such fear but though he was somewhat moved by his
grandams tears and lamentations over him and no less by the old
carlines bewailing for his days that he would so surely shorten yet
this was not by a many the last time he strayed from the stead away
into peril On a time he was missing again nightlong but in the
morning came into the house blithe and merry but exceeding hungry
and when the good man asked him where he had been and bade him
whippingcheer he said that he cared little if beaten were he so
merry a time he had had for he had gone a long way up the Dale and
about twilight this was in midMay had fallen in with a merry lad
somewhat bigger than himself who had shown him many merry plays and
at last had brought him to his house which is not builded of stone
and turf like to ours saith he but is in a hole in the rock and
there we wore away the night and there was no one there but we two
and again he showed me more strange plays which were wondrous but
some did frighten me
Then his grandsire asked him what like those plays were Said Osberne
He took a stone and stroked it and mumbled and it turned into a
mouse and played with us nought afraid a while but presently it grew
much bigger till it was bigger than a hare and great game meseemed
that was till on a sudden it stood on its hindlegs and lo it was
become a little child and O but so much littler than I and then it
ran away from us into the dark squealing the while like a mouse
behind the panel only louder Well thereafter my playmate took a
big knife and said Now drudgling I shall show thee a good game
indeed And so he did for he set the edge of the said knife against
his neck and off came his head but there came no blood nor did he
tumble down but took up his head and stuck it on again and then he
stood crowing like our big red cock Then he said Poultry cockerel
now I will do the like by thee And he came to me with the knife but
I was afraid and gat hold of his hand and had the knife from him and
then I wrestled with him and gave him a fall but I must needs let him
get up again presently whereas he grew stronger under my hand then
he thrust me from him and laughed exceeding much and said Here is a
champion come into my house forsooth Well I will leave thine head on
thy shoulders for belike I might not be able to stick it on again
which were a pity of thee for a champion shalt thou verily be in the
days to come After this all his play with me was to sit down and bid
me hearken and then he took out a little pipe and put it to his
mouth and made music out of it which was both sweet and merry And
then he left that and fell to telling me tales about the woods where
big trees grow and how his kindred had used to dwell therein and
fashioned most fair things in smiths work of gold and silver and
iron and all this liked me well and he said I tell thee that one
day thou shalt have a sword of my fathers fathers fashioning and
that will be an old one for they both were longlived And as he
spake I deemed that he was not like a child any more but a little
little old man whitehaired and wrinklefaced but without a beard
and his hair shone like glass And thenI went to sleep and when I
woke up again it was morning and I looked around and there was no one
with me So I arose and came home to you and I am safe and sound if
thou beat me not kinsman
Now ye may judge if his foreelders were not scared by the lads tale
for they knew that he had fallen in with one of the Dwarfkin and his
grandam caught him up and hugged him and kissed him well favouredly
and the carline whose name was Bridget followed on the like road
and then she said See you kinsmen if it be not my doing that the
blessed bairn has come back to us Tell us sweetheart what thou hast
round thy neck under thy shirt Osberne laughed Said he Thou didst
hang on me a morsel of parchment with signs drawn thereon and it is
done in a silk bag Fear not fostermother but that I will wear it
yet since thou makest such todo over it
Ah the kind lad thou art my dear said the carline I will tell
you kinsmen that I had that said parchment from our priest and it
is strong neckguard against all evil things for on it is scored the
Holy Rood and thereon are the names of the three Holy Kings and
other writing withal which I may not read for it is clerks Latin
And again the two women made much of the little lad while the goodman
stood by grumbling and grunting but this time did Osberne escape his
beating though he was promised a drubbing which should give him much
to think on if he went that way again and the women prayed and
besought him to be obedient to the goodman herein
But one thing he had not told his kinsfolk to wit that the Dwarf had
given him for a gift that same knife wherewith he had played the game
of headsoff and a fair sheath went with it and he had done him to
wit that most like luck would go with it Wherefore little Osberne had
the said knife hidden under his raiment along with the parchment
whereon was scored the Holy Rood and the good words of wisdom written
Chapter III Wolves Harry the Flock
Now these matters and other strayings and misdoings of the youngling
befel before the time whereof I now tell when he was as aforesaid
passed of twelve years and it was in latter autumn when the nights
are lengthening At this time there was a hired man dwelling with
them whose work it was to drive the sheep afield either up on to the
eastern bents or away off down to the water so as they might not eat
the grass of the kine from them But Osberne both of his own will and
at the bidding of the goodman went off afield with this man John and
helped him to keep the sheep from straying overfar Now one day at
evening somewhat later than he was wont when as it chanced Osberne
had not fared with him back comes John from the bents and he looked
scared and pale and he tells the tale that as the light began to fail
up there three huge wolves fell upon the sheep and slew sundry of
them and it was easy to be seen of him that he had held no very close
battle with the wolves but had stood aloof till they had done their
supper and then gathered what he could of the sheep without going
overnear the field of deed The goodman berated him for his
cowardice and seemed to begrudge him his victuals somewhat that
night whereas what with them who the wolves had slain and them who
had perchance fled away the flock was seventeen wethers short John
excused himself what he might and said that he had no weapon nought
save his shepherds staff and that the wolves had slain his dog in
the first stour but while he spake Osberne who sat by deemed him
somewhat stark and tall to be so littlehearted
However the next day the goodman and John must needs go up to the
bent to see if they might find aught alive of the sheep that were
missing and each of them bore a shield and short spear that they
might make head against the wolves if that host should fall on them in
the middle of the day Meantime Osberne by the goodmans bidding
drives the flock down toward the water nothing loth for ever the
wondrous stream seemed to draw the lad to it And a fair day he had of
it wandering amidst the sheep and being friendly with them whiles
drawing out his knife to look thereon as oft he did when he was
alone and forsooth it was a goodly weapon carven with quaintnesses
about the heft the blade inlaid with runes done in gold and the
sheath of silver Whiles also he stood on the rivers lip and looked
across the water which was there in most places as big as the Thames
is at Reading but sometimes narrower But there was nought stirring
within eyeshot on the further bank that day save the fowl and a bull
that came running along and lowing as he went on some errand whatever
it might be for he was not followed of any men So he came back with
the flock before dark all safe neither had he gone far from the
stead for so he was bidden of by his grandsire
A little after comes in the goodman with John neither of them in very
sweet temper they had seen nought of the sheep save the hide and
bones of a half score but the wolves they had not failed to see they
had come to the same place as the last night and seemed by no means
afraid of the manhost with its spears and shields wherefore these
last had turned their backs and run from them stoutly and now sat
together glowering on each other and casting now and again a gibe
each at each But they were at one in this that the wolves were huge
and fierce beyond measure and such as any man might fear But at last
John spake and said Well master it is as they say down the Dale
that this no lucky house meseems ye are beset with no common wolves
but with skinchangers who have taken the shape of wolves whether
they be Landwights or Dwarfs or rideanights of the outlaws
At that word waxed the master woodwrath as was his wont if any spake
of the luck of Wethermel and he forgot his fear in his anger and
said Hearken the fooltalk of him Thou hadst not the heart for all
thine inches to go forward before thy master and a man on the
downward side of years and now thou must needs make up fairy tales to
cover they cowardice Said John grinning Keep thy head master
for sooth it is that thou wert the first to run and wert the first
through the door
Thou liest said the goodman but this I tell thee that whosoever
was afraid then thou shalt be afraid now And he rose up and smote
his man upon the face so that he fell to the ground and John leapt up
and would have smitten his master again but even therewith comes in
the goodwife and Bridget with her bearing in the supper smoking hot
and something seemed to hold John back from his blow and he sat down
surly enough but silent Then said the goodwife What is to do here
Hast thou run against the settleend John that thy cheek is red and
blue
Laughed the youngling thereat and a word came into his mouth and he
sang
All grey on the bent
There the sheepgreedy went
The big spear and shield
Met the foes of the field
But nought the white teeth
In the warriors gat sheath
For master and man
Full meetly they ran
But now in this hall
The fear off doth fall
From one of the twain
And his hand getteth gain
But the other sits there
And new groweth his fear
Both of man and of grey
So the meat on board lay
Thou on whom gold doth ride
Meatgoddess greyeyed
Let the loafwarden eat
And the man whom he beat
And the lad that doth lie
In wallnook hereby
And thou Goldtree the fair
And the milkmother dear
Lest the meat wax acold
Both for bold and unbold
Hereat all laughed but the two men somewhat from one side of their
mouths And the goodman said See thou to it kinsman lest stripes
be thy songpay But Osberne laughed from a fair and merry face and
sang again
O lord of the land
To the staff lay no hand
Till the grey ones thou face
In the windweary place
And therewith he fell to his meat and ate stoutly and to the women it
seemed that their little kinsman had the makings of a champion in him
and his staves they loved dearly in their hearts and they smiled upon
him kindly and he looked from one to the other and quoth he
Three mothers had I
And one is gone by
But two are left here
Leal buxom and dear
As for the goodman now that the meat was getting into him the wrath
was running off and he thought within himself that presently he
should have good avail of his grandson
Chapter IV Surly John Falls Out with the Goodman
On the morrow comes John to the goodman and quoth he Master there
is small doubt that I shall one day pay thee for the pudding in the
pot which thou gavest me yestereen and after that I shall have to
take my soles out of this straightway so meseemeth I had best go
hence today
Well said the goodman if thou must go go and the devil go with
thee But as to the knock on thy cheekbone I will boot thee therefor
if thou wilt take boot and abide for though thou be no hard worker
nor very deft of thy hands yet the winter is lonely here and thou
wilt be missed somewhat
Quoth John Yea goodman but there is this in it withal that
Wethermel liketh me not though I say nought against thee for a
master I love not thy werewolves that are big and gruesome enough
to frighten two stout armed men and I love not thy Dwarfs who cut
off their own heads and stick them on again and give guesting to
little lads doing them no hurt for meseems that means that the said
Dwarf will be carving guestquarters here one day and who knows how
soon and I care not for such an one as a fellow at board And then
there is thy grandson and a fair boy he is and a good scald though
that be come upon him somewhat suddenly But he is over bigwordy for
me and I see clearly that soon there shall be two masters in this
house and one is well enough for me And lastly as to thy kinswomen
I wot well I shall have no good word from them year in year out So
take this for my last word that I shall turn my back upon thee so
soon as thou hast paid me my hire and shall go seek quarters down the
Dale at some merrier stead than this
