ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF FORM AND ORNAMENT
IN CERAMIC ART
BY WILLIAM H HOLMES
INTRODUCTORY
For the investigation of art in its early stages and in its widest
sensethere is probably no fairer field than that afforded by
aboriginal America ancient and modern
At the period of discovery art at a number of places on the American
continent seems to have been developing surely and steadily through the
force of the innate genius of the race and the more advanced nations
were already approaching the threshold of civilization at the same time
their methods were characterized by great simplicity and their art
products are as a consequence exceptionally homogeneous
The advent of European civilization checked the current of growth and
new and conflicting elements were introduced necessarily disastrous to
the native development
There is much however in the art of living tribes especially of those
least influenced by the whites capable of throwing light upon the
obscure passages of precolumbian art By supplementing the study of the
prehistoric by that of historic art which is still in many cases in its
incipient stages we may hope to penetrate deeply into the secrets of
the past
The advantages of this field as compared with Greece Egypt and the
Orient will be apparent when we remember that the dawn of art in these
countries lies hidden in the shadow of unnumbered ages while ours
stands out in the light of the very present This is well illustrated by
a remark of Birch who in dwelling upon the antiquity of the fictile
art says that the existence of earthen vessels in Egypt was at least
coeval with the formation of a written language1 Beyond this there
is acknowledged chaos In strong contrast with this is the fact that
all precolumbian American pottery precedes the acquisition of written
language and this contrast is emphasized by the additional fact that it
also antedates the use of the wheel that great perverter of the plastic
tendencies of clay
Footnote 1 Birch History of Ancient Pottery 1873 p 8
The material presented in the following notes is derived chiefly from
the native ceramic art of the United States but the principles involved
are applicable to all times and to all art as they are based upon the
laws of nature
Ceramic art presents two classes of phenomena of importance in the study
of the evolution of sthetic culture These relate first to form
and second to ornament
Form as embodied in clay vessels embraces 1st useful shapes
which may or may not be ornamental and 2d sthetic shapes which
are ornamental and may be useful There are also grotesque and
fanciful shapes which may or may not be either useful or ornamental
No form or class of forms can be said to characterize a particular age
or stage of culture In a general way of course the vessels of
primitive peoples will be simple in form while those of more advanced
races will be more varied and highly specialized
The shapes first assumed by vessels in clay depend upon the shape of the
vessels employed at the time of the introduction of the art and these
depend to a great extent upon the kind and grade of culture of the
people acquiring the art and upon the resources of the country in which
they live To illustrate If for instance some of the highly advanced
Alaskan tribes which do not make pottery should migrate to another
habitat less suitable to the practice of their old arts and well
adapted to art in clay and should there acquire the art of pottery
they would doubtless to a great extent copy their highly developed
utensils of wood bone ivory and basketry and thus reach a high grade
of ceramic achievement in the first century of the practice of the art
but on the other hand if certain tribes very low in intelligence and
having no vesselmaking arts should undergo a corresponding change of
habitat and acquire the art of pottery they might not reach in a
thousand years if left to themselves a grade in the art equal to that
of the hypothetical Alaskan potters in the first decade It is
therefore not the age of the art itself that determines its forms but
the grade and kind of art with which it originates and coexists
Ornament is subject to similar laws Where pottery is employed by
peoples in very low stages of culture its ornamentation will be of the
simple archaic kind Being a conservative art and much hampered by the
restraints of convention the elementary forms of ornament are carried a
long way into the succeeding periods and have a very decided effect upon
the higher stages Pottery brought into use for the first time by more
advanced races will never pass through the elementary stage of
decoration but will take its ornament greatly from existing art and
carry this up in its own peculiar way through succeeding generations
The character of the ornamentation does not therefore depend upon the
age of the art so much as upon the acquirements of the potter and his
people in other arts
ORIGIN OF FORM
In order to convey a clear idea of the bearing of the preceding
statements upon the history of form and ornament it will be necessary
to present a number of points in greater detail
The following synopsis will give a connected view of various possible
origins of form
By adventition
Origin of form By imitation Of natural models
By invention        Of artificial models
FORMS SUGGESTED BY ADVENTITION
The suggestions of accident especially in the early stages of art are
often adopted and become fruitful sources of improvement and progress
By such means the use of clay was discovered and the ceramic art came
into existence The accidental indentation of a mass of clay by the
foot or hand or by a fruitshell or stone while serving as an
auxiliary in some simple art may have suggested the making of a cup
the simplest form of vessel
The use of clay as a cement in repairing utensils in protecting
combustible vessels from injury by fire or in building up the walls of
shallow vessels may also have led to the formation of disks or cups
afterwards independently constructed In any case the objects or
utensils with which the clay was associated in its earliest use would
impress their forms upon it Thus if clay were used in deepening or
mending vessels of stone by a given people it would when used
independently by that people tend to assume shapes suggested by stone
vessels The same may be said of its use in connection with wood and
wicker or with vessels of other materials Forms of vessels so derived
may be said to have an adventitious origin yet they are essentially
copies although not so by design and may as readily be placed under
the succeeding head
FORMS DERIVED BY IMITATION
Clay has no inherent qualities of a nature to impose a given form or
class of forms upon its products as have wood bark bone or stone It
is so mobile as to be quite free to take form from surroundings and
where extensively used will record or echo a vast deal of nature and of
coexistent art
In this observation we have a key that will unlock many of the mysteries
of form
In the investigation of this point it will be necessary to consider the
processes by which an art inherits or acquires the forms of another art
or of nature and how one material imposes its peculiarities upon
another material In early stages of culture the processes of art are
closely akin to those of nature the human agent hardly ranking as more
than a part of the environment The primitive artist does not proceed
by methods identical with our own He does not deliberately and freely
examine all departments of nature or art and select for models those
things most convenient or most agreeable to fancy neither does he
experiment with the view of inventing new forms What he attempts
depends almost absolutely upon what happens to be suggested by preceding
forms and so narrow and so direct are the processes of his mind that
knowing his resources we could closely predict his results
The range of models in the ceramic art is at first very limited and
includes only those utensils devoted to the particular use to which the
clay vessels are to be applied later closelyassociated objects and
utensils are copied In the first stages of art when the savage makes a
weapon he modifies or copies a weapon when he makes a vessel he
modifies or copies a vessel
This law holds good in an inverse ratio to culture varying to a certain
extent with the character of the material used
Natural originalsNatural originals both animal and vegetable
necessarily differ with the country and the climate thus giving rise to
individual characters in art forms often extremely persistent and
surviving decided changes of environment
The gourd is probably the most varied and suggestive natural vessel We
find that the primitive potter has often copied it in the most literal
manner One example only out of the many available ones is necessary
This is from a mound in southeastern Missouri
In Fig 464 a illustrates a common form of the gourd while b
represents the imitation in clay
Illustration a Gourd b Clay vessel FIG 464Form
derived from a gourd
All nations situated upon the sea or upon large rivers use shells of
mollusks which without modification make excellent receptacles for
water and food Imitations of these are often found among the products
of the potters art A good example from the Mississippi Valley is shown
in Fig 465 a being the original and b the copy in clay
In Africa and in other countries such natural objects as cocoanut
shells and ostrich eggs are used in like manner
Another class of vessels those made from the skins bladders and
stomachs of animals should also be mentioned in this connection as it
is certain that their influence has frequently been felt in the
conformation of earthen utensils
In searching nature therefore for originals of primitive ceramic forms
we have little need of going outside of objects that in their natural or
slightly altered state are available for vessels
Illustration a Shell b Clay FIG 465Form derived
from a conch shell
True other objects have been copied We find a multitude of the higher
natural forms both animal and vegetable embodied in vessels of clay
but their presence is indicative of a somewhat advanced stage of art
when the copying of vessels that were functionally proper antecedents
had given rise to a familiarity with the use of clay and a capacity in
handling it that with advancing culture brought all nature within the
reach of the potter and made it assist in the processes of variation and
development
Artificial originalsThere is no doubt that among most peoples art
had produced vessels in other materials antecedent to the utilization of
clay These would be legitimate models for the potter and we may
therefore expect to find them repeated in earthenware In this way the
art has acquired a multitude of new forms some of which may be natural
forms at second hand that is to say with modifications imposed upon
them by the material in which they were first shaped But all materials
other than clay are exceedingly intractable and impress their own
characters so decidedly upon forms produced in them that ultimate
originals where there are such cannot often be traced through them
It will be most interesting to note the influence of these peculiarities
of originals upon the ceramic art
A nation having stone vessels like those of California on acquiring
the art of pottery would use the stone vessels as models and such forms
as that given in Fig 466 would arise a being in stone and b in
clay the former from California and the latter from Arizona
Similar forms would just as readily come from gourds baskets or other
globular utensils
Nations having wooden vessels would copy them in clay on acquiring the
art of pottery This would give rise to a distinct group of forms the
result primarily of the peculiarities of the woody structure Thus in
Fig 467 a we have a form of wooden vessel a sort of winged trough
that I have frequently found copied in clay The earthen vessel given in
Fig 467 b was obtained from an ancient grave in Arkansas
Illustration a stone b clay FIG 466Form derived

Illustration a wood b clay FIG 467Form derived
from a wooden tray
Illustration a Horn b Clay FIG 468Form derived
from a horn spoon
Illustration a Bark b Clay FIG 469Form derived
from a bark vessel
The carapace of some species of turtles and perhaps even the hard case
of the armadillo could be utilized in a similar way The shaping of a
knot of wood often gives rise to a dippershaped vessel such as may be
found in use by many tribes and is as likely an original for the dipper
form in clay as is the gourd or the conch shell the familiar horn
vessel of the western tribes Fig 468 a would have served equally
well The specimen given in b is from Arkansas As a rule however
such vessels cannot be traced to their originals since by copying and
recopying they have varied from the parent form tending always toward
uniform conventional shapes
A vessel of rectangular outline might originate in wood or bark In Fig
469 a we have a usual form of bark tray which is possibly the
prototype of the squarerimmed earthen vessel given in b
Illustration a Wicker b Clay FIG 470Form
originating in basketry
Illustration a Wicker b Clay FIG 471Form

Illustration a Net b Clay FIG 472Form originating
in basketry
Basketry and other classes of woven vessels take a great variety of
forms and being generally antecedent to the potters art and constantly
present with it have left an indelible impression upon ceramic forms
This is traceable in the earthenware of nearly all nations The clay
vessel is an intruder and usurps the place and appropriates the dress
of its predecessor in wicker The form illustrated in Fig 470 a is
a common one with the Pueblo peoples and their earthen vessels often
resemble it very closely as shown in b Another variety is given in
Fig 471 a and b These specimens are from southwestern Utah Fig
472 b illustrates a form quite common in the Southern States a
section in which pouchlike nets and baskets a were formerly in use
and in which the pots were often modeled
INVENTION OF FORM
In the early stages of art forms are rarely invented outright and I
shall not stop to consider the subject here
MODIFICATION OF FORM
The acquisition of new materials the development of new uses the
employment of new processes of manufacture and many other agencies lead
to the multiplication of forms through modification The processes by
which highly differentiated forms are reached are interesting throughout
and repay the closest study
A preliminary classification of the various causes that lead to
modification is given in the following synopsis
To assume form
Incapacity of materialTo retain form
Incapacity of the artisan
Changes in method of manufacture
By adventitionChanges in environment
Changes of use
Modification of form               Lack of use
Influence of new or exotic forms etc
To enhance usefulness
By intention
To please fancyFor the beautiful
For the grotesque
MODIFICATION BY ADVENTITION
Incapacity of materialIt is evident at a glance that clay lacks the
capacity to assume and to retain many of the details of form found in
antecedent vessels This necessarily results in the alteration or
omission of these features and hence arise many modifications of
original forms
The simple lack of capacity on the part of the potter who undertook to
reproduce a model would lead to the modification of all but the most
simple shapes
The acquisition of the art by a superior or an inferior race or one of
different habits would lead to decided changes A people accustomed to
carrying objects upon the head on acquiring earthen vessels would shape
the bases and the handles to facilitate this use
Improvements in the methods of manufacture are of the greatest
importance in the progress of an art The introduction of the lathe for
example might almost revolutionize form in clay
As arts multiply clay is applied to new uses Its employment in the
manufacture of lamps whistles or toys would lead to a multitude of
distinct and unique forms
The acquisition of a new vesselmaking material by a nation of potters
and the association of the forms developed through its inherent
qualities or structure would often lead ceramic shapes into new
channels
Illustration a wood b clay FIG 473Coincident forms
The contact of a nation of potters with a nation of carvers in wood
would tend very decidedly to modify the utensils of the former One
example may be given which will illustrate the possibilities of such
exotic influences upon form In Fig 473 a we have an Alaskan vessel
carved in wood It represents a beaver grasping a stick in its hands and
teeth The conception is so unusual and the style of vessel so
characteristic of the people that we should not expect to find it
repeated in other regions but the ancient graves of the Middle
Mississippi Valley have furnished a number of very similar vessels in
clay one of which is outlined in b While this remarkable coincidence
is suggestive of ethnic relationships which do not call for attention
here it serves to illustrate the possibilities of modification by
simple contact
Illustration a b FIG 471Form resulting from accident
A curious example illustrative of possible transformation by
adventitious circumstances is found in the collection from the province
of ancient Tusayan A small vessel of sphynxlike appearance possibly
derived more or less remotely from a skin vessel has a noticeable
resemblance to some life form Fig 474 a The forelegs are
represented by two large bosses the wideopen mouth takes the place of
the severed neck and a handle connects the top of the rim with the back
of the vessel The handle being broken off and the vessel inverted
b there is a decided change we are struck by the resemblance to a
frog or toad The original legs having dark concentric lines painted
around them look like large protruding eyes and the mouth gapes in the
most realistic manner while the two short broken ends of the handle
resemble legs and serve to support the vessel in an upright position
completing the illusion The fetichhunting Pueblo Indian picking up
this little vessel in its mutilated condition would probably at once
give to it the sacred character of the water animal which it resembles
and it might readily transmit its peculiarities of form to other
generations of vessels
It is not necessary in this study to refer at length to the influence of
metallic vessels upon ceramic forms They do not usually appear until
the ceramic art is far advanced and often receive a heritage of shape
from earthen forms Afterwards when the inherent qualities of the metal
have stamped their individuality upon utensils the debt is paid back to
clay with interest as will be seen by reference to later forms in many
parts of the world
MODIFICATION BY INTENTION
To enhance usefulnessThere can be no doubt that the desire upon the
part of the archaic potter to increase the usefulness and convenience of
his utensils has been an important agent in the modification of form
The earliest vessels employed were often clumsy and difficult to handle
The favorite conch shell would hold water for him who wished to drink
but the breaking away of spines and the extraction of the interior whorl
improved it immeasurably The clumsy mortar of stone with its thick
walls and great weight served a useful purpose but it needed a very
little intelligent thought to show that thin walls and neatlytrimmed
margins were much preferable
Vessels of clay aside from the forms imposed upon them by their
antecedents and associates would necessarily be subject to changes
suggested by the growing needs of man These would be worked out with
everincreasing ease by his unfolding genius for invention Further
investigation of this phase of development would carry me beyond the
limits set for this paper
To please fancyThe skill acquired by the handling of clay in
constructing vessels and in efforts to increase their usefulness would
open an expansive field for the play of fancy The potter would no
sooner succeed in copying vessels having life form than he would be
placed in a position to realize his capacity to imitate forms not
peculiar to vessels His ambition would in time lead him even beyond the
limits of nature and he would invade the realm of imagination embodying
the conceptions of superstition in the plastic clay This tendency would
be encouraged and perpetuated by the relegation of vessels of particular
forms to particular ceremonies
ORIGIN OF ORNAMENT
The birth of the embellishing art must be sought in that stage of animal
development when instinct began to discover that certain attributes or
adornments increased attractiveness When art in its human sense came
into existence ideas of embellishment soon extended from the person
with which they had been associated to all things with which man had
to deal The processes of the growth of the sthetic idea are long and
obscure and cannot be taken up in this place
The various elements of embellishment in which the ceramic art is
interested may be assigned to two great classes based upon the
character of the conceptions associated with them These are
ideographic and nonideographic In the present paper I shall treat
chiefly of the non ideographic reserving the ideographic for a second
paper
Elements nonideographic from the start are derived mainly from two
sources 1st from objects natural or artificial associated with the
arts and 2d from the suggestions of accidents attending construction
Natural objects abound in features highly suggestive of embellishment
and these are constantly employed in art Artificial objects have two
classes of features capable of giving rise to ornament these are
constructional and functional In a late stage of development all
things in nature and in art however complex or foreign to the art in
its practice are subject to decorative treatment This latter is the
realistic pictorial stage one of which the student of native American
culture needs to take little cognizance
Elements of design are not invented outright man modifies combines
and recombines elements or ideas already in existence but does not
create
A classification of the sources of decorative motives employed in the
ceramic art is given in the following diagram

SUGGESTIONS OF NATURAL FEATURES OF OBJECTS
The first articles used by men in their simple arts have in many cases
possessed features suggestive of decoration Shells of mollusks are
exquisitely embellished with ribs spines nodes and colors The same
is true to a somewhat limited extent of the shells of the turtle and the
armadillo and of the hard cases of fruits
These decorative features though not essential to the utensil are
nevertheless inseparable parts of it and are cast or unconsciously
copied by a very primitive people when similar articles are artificially
produced in plastic material In this way a utensil may acquire
ornamental characters long before the workman has learned to take
pleasure in such details or has conceived an idea beyond that of simple
utility This may be called unconscious embellishment In this
fortuitous fashion a ribbed variety of fruit shell would give rise to a
ribbed vessel in clay one covered with spines would suggest a noded
vessel etc When taste came to be exercised upon such objects these
features would be retained and copied for the pleasure they afforded
Illustration aShell vessel bCopy in clay FIG 475Scroll
derived from the spire of a conch shell
Passing by the many simple elements of decoration that by this
unconscious process could be derived from such sources let me give a
single example by which it will be seen that not only elementary forms
but even so highly constituted an ornament as the scroll may have been
brought thus naturally into the realm of decorative art The seashell
has always been intimately associated with the arts that utilize clay
and abounds in suggestions of embellishment The Busycon was almost
universally employed as a vessel by the tribes of the Atlantic drainage
of North America Usually it was trimmed down and excavated until only
about threefourths of the outer wall of the shell remained At one end
was the long spikelike base which served as a handle and at the other
the flat conical apex with its very pronounced spiral line or ridge
expanding from the center to the circumference as seen in Fig 475 a
This vessel was often copied in clay as many good examples now in our
museums testify The notable feature is that the shell has been copied
literally the spiral appearing in its proper place A specimen is
illustrated in Fig 475 b which although simple and highly
conventionalized still retains the spiral figure
Illustration a b c FIG 476Possible derivation of the
current scroll
In another example we have four of the noded apexes placed about the rim
of the vessel as shown in Fig 476a the conception being that of
four conch shells united in one vessel the bases being turned inward
and the apexes outward Now it is only necessary to suppose the addition
of the spiral lines always associated with the nodes to have the
result shown in b and by a still higher degree of convention we have
the classic scroll ornament given in c Of course no such result as
this could come about adventitiously as successful combination calls
for the exercise of judgment and taste but the initiatory steps could
be takenthe motive could enter artwithout the conscious supervision
of the human agent
SUGGESTIONS BY FEATURES OF ARTIFICIAL OBJECTS
Illustration FIG 477Ornament derived through the modification of
handles
Functional featuresFunctional features of art products liable to
influence ornament comprise handles legs feet rims bands and other
peculiarities of shape originating in utility Handles for instance
may have been indigenous to a number of arts they are coeval and
coextensive with culture The first load weapon or vessel transported
by man may have been suspended by a vine or filament Such arts as have
fallen heir to handles have used them according to the capacities of the
material employed Of all the materials stone is probably the least
suited to their successful use while clay utilizes them in its own
peculiar way giving to them a great variety of expression They are
copied in clay from various models but owing to the inadequate
capacities of the material often lose their function and degenerate
into mere ornaments which are modified as such to please the potters
fancy Thus for example the series of handles placed about the neck of
the vessel become by modification in frequent copying a mere band of
ornamental figures in relief or even finally in engraved punctured or
painted lines in the manner suggested in Fig 477 Legs pedestals
spouts and other features may in a like manner give rise to decoration
Illustration aCoiled fillet of clay bDouble coil
FIG 478Scroll derived from coil of clay
Constructional featuresFeatures of vessels resulting from
construction are infinitely varied and often highly suggestive of
decoration Constructional peculiarities of the clay utensils themselves
are especially worthy of notice and on account of their actual presence
in the art itself are more likely to be utilized or copied for ceramic
ornament than those of other materials The coil so universally
employed in construction has had a decided influence upon the ceramic
decoration of certain peoples as I have shown in a paper on ancient
Pueblo art From it we have not only a great variety of surface
ornamentation produced by simple treatment of the coil in place but
probably many forms suggested by the use of the coil in vessel building
as for instance the spiral formed in beginning the base of a coiled
vessel Fig 478 a from which the double scroll b as a separate
feature could readily be derived and finally the chain of scrolls so
often seen in border and zone decoration This familiarity with the use
of fillets or ropes of clay would also lead to a great variety of
applied ornament examples of which from Pueblo art are given in Fig
479 The sinuous forms assumed by a rope of clay so employed would
readily suggest to the Indian the form of the serpent and the means of
representing it and might thus lead to the introduction of this much
revered creature into art
Illustration FIG 479Ornamental use of fillets
Of the various classes of utensils associated closely with the ceramic
art there are none so characteristically marked by constructional
features as nets and wicker baskets The twisting interlacing
knotting and stitching of filaments give relieved figures that by
