Michael Arranstoun was
And to be sure he had ample reason as you my friend who may happen
to have begun this tale will presently see
It is really most irritating to be suddenly confronted with the
consequences of ones follies at any age but at twentyfour when
otherwise the whole life is smiling for one it seems quite too hard
The frightful language this wellendowed young gentleman now indulged
in half aloud and half in thought would be quite impossible to put on
paper It contained what almost amounted to curses for a certain lady
whose appearance could she have been seen at this moment suggested
that of a pious little saint
How the h can I keep from marrying her Mr Arranstoun said more
than aloud this time and then kicking an innocent footstool across the
room he called his bulldog put on his cap and stamped out on to the
old stone balcony which opened from this apartment and was soon
stalking down the staircase and across the lawn to a little door in the
great fortified wall which led into the park
He had hardly left the room when from the wide arched doorway of his
bedchamber beyond there entered Mr Johnson his superior valet
carrying some ridingboots and a silk shirt over his arm You could see
through the open door that it was a very big and comfortable bedroom
which had evidently been adapted to its present use from some much more
stately beginning A large vaulted chamber it was with three narrow
windows looking on to the grim courtyard beneath
Michael Arranstoun had selected this particular suite for himself when
his father died ten years before and his mother was left to spoil him
until she too departed from this world when he was sixteen
What a splendid inheritance he had come into This old border castle up
in the northand not a mortgage on the entire property While from his
mother a number of solid golden sovereigns flowed into his coffers
every yearobtained by trade That was a little disgusting for the
Arranstounsbut extremely useful
It might have been from this same strain that the fortunate young man
had also inherited that common sense which made him fairly levelheaded
and not given as a rule to any overmad taste
The Arranstouns had been at Arranstoun since the time of those tiresome
Picts and Scotsand for generations they had raided their neighbors
castles and lands and carried off their cattle and wives and daughters
and what not They had seized anything they fancied and were a strong
ruthless brutal race not much vitiated by civilization These
instincts of seizing what they wanted had gone on in them throughout
eleven hundred years and more and were there until this day when
Michael the sole representative of this branch of the family said
Damn and kicked a footstool across the room into the grate
Mr Johnson was quite aware of the peculiarity of the family Indeed he
was not surprised when Alexander Armstrong remarked upon it presently
Alexander Armstrong was the old retainer who now enjoyed the position
of guide to the Castle upon the two days a week when tourists were
allowed to walk through the state rooms and look at the splendid
carvings and armor and pictures and the collection of plate
Johnson had had time to glance over his masters correspondence that
morning which with characteristic recklessness that gentleman had
left upon his bed while he went to his bath so his servant knew the
cause of his bad temper and had been prudent and kept a good deal out
of the way But the news was so interesting he felt Alexander Armstrong
really ought to share the thrill
Mrs Hatfields husband is dying he announced as Armstrong very
diffidently peeped through the window from the balcony and then
seeing no one but his friend the valet entered the room
Alexander Armstrong spoke in broad Scotch but I shall not attempt to
transcribe this barbaric language sufficient to tell you that he made
the excuse for his intrusion by saying that he had wanted to get some
order from the master about the tourists
We shant have any tourists when shes installed here as mistress Mr
Johnson remarked sepulchrally
Armstrong was heard to murmur that he did not know what Mr Johnson
meant This was too stupid
Why I told you straight off Mrs Hatfields husband is dying Johnson
exclaimed contemptuously She wrote one of her mauve billy doos this
morning telling the master so and suggesting theyd soon be able to be
married and happypretty coldblooded I call it considering the poor
man is not yet in his grave
Armstrong was almost knocked over by this statement then he
laughedand what he said meant in plain English that Mr Johnson need
not worry himself for no Arranstoun had ever been known to be coerced
into any course of conduct which he did not desire himselfnot being
hampered by consideration for women or by any consideration but his own
will For the matter of that a headstrong ruthless race all of them
and as Mr Johnson must be very well aware their own particular master
was a true chip of the old block
See his bonny blue eye I think he pronounced it ee see his
mouth shut like a game spring See his strong arms and his height See
him smash the boughs off trees when they get in his way and then tell
me a womans going to get dominion over him Go along Mr Johnson
But Johnson remained unconvinced and troubled he had had several
unpleasant proofs of womans infernal cunning in his own sphere of life
and Mrs Hatfield he knew was as well endowed with Eves wit as any
French maid
Well ha a bet about it if you like Armstrong remarked as he got up
to go the clock striking three He knew the first batch of afternoon
tourists would be clamoring at the gate
Mr Johnson looked at the ridingboots in his hand
He went straight off for his ride without tasting a bite of breakfast
or seeing Mr Fordyce and he didnt return to lunch and just now I
find every article of clothing strewn upon the floorwhen he came in
and took another bathhe did not even ring for mehe must have
galloped all the time his temper would frighten a fighting cock
Meanwhile Michael Arranstoun was tramping his park with giant strides
and suddenly came upon his friend and guest Henry Fordyce whose very
presence in his house he had forgotten so turbulent had his thoughts
been ever since the early post came in Henry Fordyce was a leisurely
creature and had come out for a stroll on the exquisite June day upon
his own account
They exchanged a few remarks and gradually got back to Michaels
sittingroom again and rang for drinks
Mr Fordyce had by this time become quite aware that an active volcano
was going on in his friend but had waited for the first indication of
the cause It came in the course of a conversation after the footman
had left the room and both men were reclining in big chairs with their
iced whiskey and soda
It is a shame to stay indoors on such a day Henry said lazily
looking out upon the balcony and the glittering sunshine
I never saw anyone enjoy a holiday like you do Henry Michael
retorted petulantly I cant enjoy anything lately Pon my soul it
is worth going into Parliament to get such an amount of pleasure out of
a weeks freedom
But Henry did not agree that it was freedom when even here at
Arranstoun he had been pestered to patronize the local bazaar
The penalty of greatness I wonder when you will be prime minister
Lord what a grind
Mr Fordyce stretched himself in his chair and lit a cigar
It may be a grind he said meditatively but it is for some definite
idea of goodeven if I am a slave whereas youyou are tied and bound
to a womanand such a woman You have not been able to call your soul
your own since last October as it isand before you know where you are
you will be attending the husbands funeral and your own wedding in the
same week
Michael bounded from his chair with an oath Ill be shot if I do he
said and sat down again Then his voice grew a little uncertain and he
went on
It is worrying me awfully though Henry If poor old Maurice does puff
outI suppose I ought to marry herI
Mr Fordyce stiffened and the sleepy look in his gray eyes altered to a
flash of steel
Let us have a little plain speaking Michael old boy It is not as
though I do not know the whole circumstance of your affair with Violet
Hatfield I warned you about her in the beginning when you met her at
my sister Roses but as usual you would take your own course
Michael began to speak but checked himselfand Henry Fordyce went on
I have had a letter from Rose this morningas you of course know
Violet is staying for this Whitsuntide with them having dragged her
wretched husband dying of consumption as he is to this merry party
WellRose says poor Maurice is in a terrible state caught a fresh cold
on Saturdayand she adds So I suppose we shall soon see Violet
installed at Arranstoun as mistress
I knowI heard from Violet herself this morning and Michael put his
head down dejectedly
Ebbsworth is only thirtyfive miles from here Mr Fordyce announced
with meaning Violet can pop in on you at any moment and shell clinch
the matter and bind you with her cobwebs before you can escape
Oh Lord
You know you are dead sick of her Michaeland you know that I am not
the sort of man who would ever speak of a woman thus without grave
reason but she does not care for you any more than the half a dozen
others who occupied your proud position before your dayit is only for
money and the glory of having you tied to her apron strings It was not
any good hammering on while the passion was upon you but I have
watched you and have seen that it is waning so nows my time With
this danger in front of you you have got to pull yourself together old
boy and cut and run
That would be no use Then Michael stammered a little I say Henry
I wont hear a word against her You can thunder at mebut leave her
out
Mr Fordyce smiled
Did she express deep grief at poor Maurices condition in her letter
he asked
Ernonot exactly
I thought notshe probably suggested all sorts of joys with you when
she is free
There was an ominous silence
Mr Fordyces voice now took on that crisp tone which his adversaries in
the House of Commons so well knew meant that they must look to their
guns
Delightful woman A spider I tell you a roaring hypocrite too
bamboozling poor Rose into thinking her a virtuous persecuted little
darling with a noble passion for you and my sister is a downright
person not easily fooled At this moment Violet is probably shedding
tears on her shoulder over poor Maurice while she is plotting how soon
she can become mistress of Arranstoun Good God when I think of itI
would rather get in a girl from the village and go through the ceremony
with her and make myself safe than have the prospect of Violet
Hatfield as a wife Michael I tell you seriously dear boyyou wont
have the ghost of a chance if you are still unmarried when poor Maurice
dies
Michael bounded from his chair once more He was perfectly
furiousfurious with the situationfurious with the womanfurious
with himself
Confound it Henry Iknow itbut it does not mend matters your
ranting thereand I am so sorry for the poor chapMaurice I meana
very decent fellow poor Maurice Cant you suggest any way out
Mr Fordyce mused a moment while he deliberately puffed smoke
Michaels impatience increasing so that he ran his hands through his
dark smooth hair whose shiny immaculate brushing was usually his
pride
Cant you suggest a way out he reiterated
Mr Fordyce did not replythen after a moment You were always too
much occupied with women Michaelfrom your first scrape when you left
Eton and over this affair you have been a complete fool
Michael was heard to swear again
You have been inconsistent too because you did not even employ your
usual ruthless methods of doing what you pleased with them You have
simply drifted into allowing this vile creatures cobwebs to cling on to
your whole existence until you are almost paralyzed and it seems to me
that an immediate marriage with someone else is your only way of escape
Such a waste of your life Just analyze the position You have
everything in the world this glorious placean old
namemoneyprestigeand if your inclinations do run to the material
side of things instead of the intellectual they are still successful in
their demonstration No one has a better eye for a horse or is a finer
shot The best at driven grouse for your age my boy I have ever seen
You are full of force Michael and ought to do some decent
thinginstead of which you spoil the whole outlook by fooling after
this infernal womanand you have not now the pluck to cut the Gordian
knot She will drag you to the lowest depths
Then he laughed And only think of that voice in ones ears all day
long I would rather marry old Bessie at the South Lodge She is
eightyfour she tells me and would soon leave you a widower
The first ray of hope shot into Michaels bright blue eyesand he
exclaimed with a kind of joy as he seized Binko his bulldog by his
fat engaging throat
Bessie Old BessieBy Jove what an ideathe very thing Shed do it
for me like a shot dear old body
Binko gurgled and slobbered in sympathy
She would be kind to you too Binko She would not say she found your
hairs on every chair and that you dribbled on her dress She would not
tell your master that he left his cigaretteash about and she hated the
smell of smoke She would not want this room for her boudoir she
Then he stopped his flow of words suddenly catching sight of the
whimsical sardonic smile upon his friends face
Oh Lord he mumbled contritely I had forgotten you were here
Henry I am so jolly upset
This heartlessness about poor Maurice has finished you eh Mr
Fordyce suggested He felt he might be gaining his end
Michael covered his face with his hands
It seems so ghastly to think of marriage with the poor chap not yet
deadI am fairly knocked overit really is the last strawbut she
will cry and make a sceneand she has certainly argumentsand it will
make one feel such a cad to leave her
She wrote thatdid shewrote of marriage and her husbands last
attack of hemorrhage in the same paragraph I suppose Michael it is
revolting My dear boy you must break away from herand then do try to
occupy yourself with more important things than women Believe me they
are all very well in their way and in their proper placeto be treated
with the greatest courtesy and respect as wives and motherseven loved
if you will for a recreationbut as vital factors in a mans real
life My dear fellow the idea is ridiculousthat life should be for
his country and the development of his own soul
Michael Arranstoun laughed
Jolly old Mohammedan You think women have none I suppose
Henry Fordyce frowned because it was rather truebut he denied the
charge
Nothing of the sort Merely I see things at their proper balance and
you cannot
Michael leaned back in his chair he was quieter for a moment
I only see what I want to see Henryand I am a savageI cannot help
itwe have always been so When I fancy a woman I must obtain
herwhen I want a horse I must have it It is always mustand we
have not done so badly We still possess our shoulders and chins and
strength after eleven hundred years of it and he stretched out a
splendid arm with a force which could have felled an ox
An undoubtedly fine specimen of British manhood he looked sitting there
in the June sunlight which came in a shaft from the south mullioned
window in the corner beyond the great fireplace the space between
occupied by a large picture of uncertain date depicting the landing of
Mary Queen of Scots in her northern kingdom
His eyes roamed to this
One of my ancestors was among that party he said pointing to a
figure He had just killed a Moreton and stolen his wife that is why
he looks so perkythe fellow in the blue doublet
Mr Fordyce rose from his chair and fired his last shot
And now a female spider is going to paralyze the last Arranstoun and
rule him for the rest of his days sapping his vitality
But Michael protested
By heaven no
Well Ill leave you to think about it I am going for another stroll
on this lovely day He had got to the window by this time which looked
into the courtyard on the opposite side to the balcony Goodness what
a party of tourists It is a bore for you to have them all over the
place like this To own a castle with state rooms to be shown to the
public has its disadvantages
Michael looked at them too a large party of Americans mostly of that
class which compose the tourists of all countries and which no nation
feels proud to own He had seen hundreds of such and turned away
indifferently
They only come here twice a week and it has been allowed for such
agesthey are generally quiet and fortunately their perambulations
close at the end of the gallery They dont intrude upon my own suite
They get to the chapel by the outside door
Henry crossed the room and went on to the balcony
Mrs Hatfield will alter all that he laughed as he disappeared from
view
Michael flashed a rageful glance at his back and then flung himself
into his great armchair again and pulled the wrinkled mass which
called itself a prize bulldog on to his lap
I believe hes right and we are caught Binko If we fled to the Rocky
Mountains she would track us If we stay and face it shell make an
almighty scandal and force us to marry her What in the devils name are
we to do
Binko licked his masters hands and made noises so full of gurgling
slobbering sympathy no heart could have remained uncomforted Who
knows His canine common sense may have telepathically transmitted a
thought for Michael suddenly plopped him on the floor and stalked
toward the fireplace to ring the bell while he exclaimed as though
answering a suggestion Yes well send for old Bessiethats the only
way
But before he could reach his goal the picture of Mary Queen of Scots
landing fell forward with a crash and through the aperture of a secret
door which it concealed there tumbled a very young and pretty girl
right into the room
CHAPTER II
Mr Arranstoun was extremely startled and annoyed too and before he
took in the situation he had exclaimed while Binko gave an ominous
growl of displeasure
Confound itwho is that These are private rooms Then seeing it was
a girl on the floor he said in another voice Quiet Binko and the
dog retired to his own basket under a distant table Oh I beg your
pardonbut
The creature on the floor blinked at Michael with large round violet
eyes but did not move while she answered aggrievedlywith a very
faint accent whether a little French or a little American or a little
of both he was not sure only that it had something attractive about
it
You may well say but I did not mean to intrude upon your private
roombut I had to run away from Mr Greenbankhe was so horrid here
she gasped a little for breathand I happened to see something like a
door ajar in the Gainsborough room so I fled through it and it
fastened after me with a snapI could not open it againand it was
pitch dark in that dreadful passage and not a scrap of airI felt
suffocated and I pushed on anywhereand something gave way and I fell
in herethats all
She rattled this out without a stop and then stared at Michael with her
big childish eyes but did not attempt to rise from the floor
He walked toward her and held out his hand and with ceremonious and
ironical politeness he began
May I not help youI could offer you a chair
She interrupted him while she struggled up refusing his proffered hand
Ive knocked myself against your nasty tablewhy do you have it in
that place
Michael sat down upon the edge of it and went on in his ironical tone
Had I known I was to have the honor of this visit I should certainly
have had it moved
There is no use being sarcastic the girl said almost crying now It
hurts very much andandI want to go home
Mr Arranstoun pushed a comfortable monster seat toward her and said
more sympathetically
I am very sorrybut where is home
The girl sank into the chair and smoothed out her pink cotton frock
the skimpy skirt not as narrow as in these days but still short and
spare showed a perfect pair of feet and ankles
Shes American of course then Michael said to himself observing
these and quite pretty if that smudge of grime was off her face
She was looking at him now with her large innocent eyes which
contained no shadow of gene over the unusual situation and then she
answered quite simply
I havent a home you knowIm just staying at the Inn with Uncle
Mortimer and Aunt Jemima andandMr Greenbankand we are tourists I
suppose and were looking at the pictureswhenwhen I had to run
away
Michael felt a little piqued with curiosity she was a diversion after
his perplexing irritating meditations
It would be so interesting to hear why you ran awaythe whole story
he suggested
The girl turned her head and looked out of the window showing a dear
little baby profile and masses of light brown hair rolled up anyhow at
the back She did not look older than seventeen at the outside and was
peculiarly childish and slender for that
But I should have to tell you from the beginning and it is so
longand you are a stranger
Michael drew another chair nearer to her and sat down while his manner
took on a note of grave elderly concern which rather belied the
twinkle of mischief in his eyes
Never mind thatI am sympathetic and I am your hostand by
Jovewont you have some tea You look awfully tired anddusty and
he rang the bell and then reseated himself See to be quite orthodox
we will make our own introductionI am Michael Arranstounand you
are
The girl rose and made him a polite bow I am Sabine Delburg she
announced He bowed alsoand then she went into a peal of silvery
laughter that seemed to contain all the glad notes of spring and youth
Oh this is fun and II should like some tea She caught sight of
herself in an old mirror which stood upon a commode Goodness what a
guy I look Why didnt you tell me that my hat was crooked She settled
it straight and began searching for a handkerchief up her sleeve and in
her belt but none was to be found
So Mr Arranstoun handed her a clean one he chanced to have in his
pocket I expect you want to wipe the smudge of dirt off your face he
hazarded
She took it laughing and showing an even row of beautiful teeth between
red full baby lips
You are the owner of this castle she went on as she gave firm rubs
at the velvet pink cheeks That must be nice You can do what you like
I suppose and here a sigh of regret escaped and made her voice lower
I wish I could Mr Arranstoun answered feelingly
Well if I were a man I would
What would you do
She turned and faced him while she said with extreme solemnity
I should never marry Mr Greenbank
Michael laughed
I dont suppose you would if you were a man At this moment a footman
answered the bell Bring tea please his master ordered inwardly
amused at the servants astonished face and then when they were alone
again he continued his sympathetic questioning
Who is Mr Greenbank You had to flee from himyou said he was horrid
I believe
Miss Delburg had removed her hat and was trying to tidy her hair before
readjusting it she had the hatpin in her mouth but took it out to
answer vehemently
So he is a pig And I went and got engaged to him this morning You
see turning to the glass again quite unembarrassed I cant get my
money until I am marriedand Uncle is so disagreeable and Aunt Jemima
nags all day long and it was left in Papas will that I was to live
with themand I dont come of age until I am twentyone but I can get
the money directly if I marryI was seventeen in May and of course no
one could stand it till twentyone Mr Greenbank is the only person
who has asked me and Aunt Jemima says no one else ever will I have
been out of the Convent for a whole month and I cant bear it
Michael was beginning really to enjoy himself She was something so
fresh so entirely different to anything he had ever seen in his life
before There was nothing of shyness or awkwardness in her manner as
any English girl would have shown She was absolutely at ease with a
childish confiding innocence which he saw plainly was real and not put
on for his benefit It was almost incredible in these uptodate days A
most engaging morsel of seventeen summers he decided as he answered
with overgrave concern
What a hard fatebut you have not told me yet why you ran away
The girl had finished her toilet by now and reseated herself with a
grownup air in the big armchair
Oh well he was justhorridthat was all and then abruptly turning
the conversation It is a nice place you have here and it does feel
lovely doing something wrong like thishaving tea with you I mean You
know I have never spoken to a young man before The Nuns always told us
they were dreadful creaturesbut you dont look so bad and she
examined her host critically
Michael accepted the implied appreciation
What is Mr Greenbank then
The silver laugh rang out again while she jumped up and peeped from
the window into the courtyard
Samuelhes only a thing Oh Uncle and Aunt would be so angry if they
could see me here And I expect they are all in a fine fuss now to know
what has happened to me They never saw me go through the door and I
hope they think that Ive committed suicide out of one of the windows
Look and she danced excitedly there is Uncle talking to the
commissionaire Oh what fun
Mr Arranstoun peeped tooand saw a spare elderly American of grim
appearance in anxious confab with Alexander Armstrong
The whole situation struck him as delightful and he laughed gaily
while he suggested You are perhaps rather a difficult charge
Miss Delburg resented this at once
What an idea How would you like to marry Mr Greenbank or stay with
Aunt Jemima for four years
Well you see I cant contemplate it as I am not a girl
Again those white teeth showed and the violet eyes were suffused with
laughter
No Of course not How silly I ambut I mean how would you care to be
forced to do something you did not like
Michael thought of his own fate
By Jove I should hate it
Wellyou can understand me
Then the door opened and the butler and footman brought in the tea
eyeing their masters guest furtively while they maintained that
superbly aloof manner of wellbred English servants The pause their
entrance caused gave Mr Arranstoun time to think and an idea gradually
began to unfold itself in his brainand unconsciously he took out and
then replaced in his breast pocket a mauve closelywritten letter
while a frown of deep cogitation crept over his face
Miss Delburg for her part was only thrilled with the sight of the very
agreeable tea and after waiting a moment to see what her preoccupied
host would do when the servants left the room hunger forced her to fall
to the temptation of a particularly appetizing chocolate cake which she
surreptitiously seized and began munching with the frank joy of a
child
I do love them she sighed and we never were allowed them only once
a month after Moravia Cloudwater got that awful toothache and had to
have a big grinder pulled out
Michael was paying no attention to her he had walked rapidly up and
down the room once or twice much to her astonishment
At last he spoke
I have an ideabut first let me give you some teaNodo help
yourself then he paused awkwardly and she at once proceeded to fill
her cup
Binko had condescended to emerge from his basket under the table
Teatime was an hour when he allowed himself to take an interest in
human beings
Oh you darling the girl cried putting down her cup You fat
lovely wrinkly darling
He is a nice dog his master admitted his voice was actually
nervousand he pulled Binko to him by his solid fleshy paws while he
sat down in his chair again
Miss Delburg had got back into her seat where she munched a cake and
continued her tea The chair was so deep and long that her little bits
of feet did not nearly reach the ground but dangled there
Maynt I pour you out some too she asked getting forward again I
do love to pour outand do you take sugar I like lumps and lumps of
it
Oheryes Michael agreed absently and then he went on with the
determined air of a person getting something off his chest I hardly
know how to say what I am thinking of it sounds so strange ListenI
also must marry someoneanyoneto avert a fate I dont wantWhat do
you say to marrying me
The teapot came down into the tray with a bump while the round
