Paul said slowly Last time I saw Raul was in a swamp near Lake
Managua The very last time
The Chief said hurriedly Dont give me the details I leave details up
to you
I know Paul said flatly
His superior drew a pound can of Sir Walter Raleigh across the desk
selected a briar from a pipe rack and while he was packing in tobacco
said Paul do you know what day it isand what year
Its Tuesday And 1965
The bureau chief looked at his disk calendar Ummm Today the Seven
Year Plan is completed
Paul snorted
The Chief said mildly Successfully For all practical purposes the
USSR has surpassed us in gross national product
Illustration
Thats not the way I understand it
Then you make the mistake of believing our propaganda Thats always a
mistake believing your own propaganda Worse than believing the other
mans
Our steel capacity is a third again as much as theirs
Yes and currently what with our readjustmentremember when they used
to call them recessions or even earlier depressionsour steel
industry is operating at less than sixty per cent of capacity The
Soviets always operate at one hundred per cent of capacity They dont
have to worry about whether or not they can sell it If they produce
more steel than they immediately need they use it to build another
steel mill
The Chief shook his head As long ago as 1958 they began passing us
product by product Grain butter and timber production jet aircraft
space flight and coal
Paul leaned forward impatiently We put out more than three times as
many cars refrigerators kitchen stoves washing machines
His superior said Thats the point While we were putting the product
of our steel mills into automobiles and automatic kitchen equipment
they did without these things and put their steel into more steel mills
more railroads more factories We leaned back and took it easy sneered
at their progress talked a lot about our freedom and liberty to our
allies and the neutrals and enjoyed our refrigerators and washing
machines until they finally passed us
You sound like a Tass broadcast from Moscow
Ummm Ive been trying to the Chief said However thats still
roughly the situation The fact that you and I personally and a couple
of hundred million Americans prefer our cars and such to more steel
mills and prefer our personal freedoms and liberties is beside the
point We should have done less laughing seven years ago and more
thinking about today As things stand give them a few more years at
this pace and every neutral nation in the world is going to fall into
their laps
Thats putting it strong isnt it
Strong the Chief growled disgustedly Thats putting it mildly Even
some of our allies are beginning to waver Eight years ago India and
China both set out to industrialize themselves Today China is the
third industrial power of the world Wheres India about twentieth Ten
years from now China will probably be first I dont even allow myself
to think where shell be twentyfive years from now
The Indians were a bunch of idealistic screwballs
Thats one of the favorite alibis isnt it Actually we the West let
them down They couldnt get underway The Soviets backed China with
everything they could toss in
Paul crossed his legs and leaned back It seems to me Ive run into
this discussion a few hundred times at cocktail parties
The Chief pulled out a drawer and brought forth a kingsize box of
kitchen matches He struck one with a thumbnail and peered through
tobacco smoke at Paul Koslov as he lit up
The point is that the system the Russkies used when they started their
first fiveyear plan back in 1928 and the system used in China works
If we with our traditions of freedom and liberty like it or not it
works Every citizen of the country is thrown into the grinding mill to
increase production Everybody the Chief grinned sourly that is
except the party elite who are running the whole thing Everybody
sacrifices for the sake of the progress of the whole country
I know Paul said Give me enough time and Ill find out what this
lecture is all about
The Chief grunted at him The Commies are still in power If they
remain in power and continue to develop the way theyre going well be
through completely through in another few years Well be so far
behind well be the worlds laughingstockand everybody else will be
on the Soviet bandwagon
He seemed to switch subjects Ever hear of Somerset Maugham
Sure Ive read several of his novels
I was thinking of Maugham the British Agent rather than Maugham the
novelist but its the same man
British agent
Ummm He was sent to Petrograd in 1917 to prevent the Bolshevik
revolution The Germans had sent Lenin and Zinoviev up from Switzerland
where theyd been in exile by a sealed train in hopes of starting a
revolution in Czarist Russia The point Im leading to is that in one of
his books The Summing Up I believe Maugham mentions in passing that
had he got to Petrograd possibly six weeks earlier he thinks he could
have done his job successfully
Paul looked at him blankly What could he have done
The Chief shrugged It was all out war The British wanted to keep
Russia in the allied ranks so as to divert as many German troops as
possible from the Western front The Germans wanted to eliminate the
Russians Maugham had carte blanche Anything would have gone Elements
of the British fleet to fight the Bolsheviks unlimited amounts of money
for anything he saw fit from bribery to hiring assassins What would
have happened for instance if he could have had Lenin and Trotsky
killed
Paul said suddenly What has all this got to do with me
Were giving you the job this time
Maughams job Paul didnt get it
No the other one I dont know who the German was who engineered
sending Lenin up to Petrograd but thats the equivalent of your job
He seemed to go off on another bent Did you read Djilas The New
Class about a decade ago
Most of it as I recall One of Titos top men who turned against the
Commies and did quite a job of exposing the socalled classless
society
Thats right Ive always been surprised that so few people bothered to
wonder how Djilas was able to smuggle his book out of one of Titos
strongest prisons and get it to publishers in the West
Never thought of it Paul agreed How could he
Because the Chief said knocking the ash from his pipe and replacing
it in the rack there was and is a very strong underground in all the
Communist countries Not only Yugoslavia but the Soviet Union as well
Paul stirred impatiently Once again whats all this got to do with
me
Theyre the ones youre going to work with The antiSoviet
underground Youve got unlimited leeway Unlimited support to the
extent we can get it to you Unlimited funds for whatever you find you
need them for Your job is to help the underground start a new Russian
Revolution
Paul Koslov his face still bandaged following plastic surgery spent a
couple of hours in the Rube Goldberg department inspecting the latest
gadgets of his trade
Derek Stevens said The Chief sent down a memo to introduce you to this
new item We call it a Tracy
Paul frowned at the wristwatch fingered it a moment held it to his
ear It ticked and the second hand moved Tracy he said
Stevens said After Dick Tracy Remember a few years ago His wrist
twoway radio
But this is really a watch Paul said
Sure Keeps fairly good time too However thats camouflage Its
also a twoway radio Tight beam from wherever you are to the Chief
Paul pursed his lips The transistor boys are really doing it up
brown He handed the watch back to Derek Stevens Show me how it
works Derek
They spent fifteen minutes on the communications device then Derek
Stevens said Heres another item the Chief thought you might want to
see
It was a compact shortmuzzled hand gun Paul handled it with the ease
of long practice The grips clumsy Whats its advantage I dont
particularly like an automatic
Derek Stevens motioned with his head Come into the firing range
Koslov and well give you a demonstration
Paul shot him a glance from the side of his eyes then nodded Lead
on
In the range Stevens had a mansize silhouette put up He stood to one
side and said OK let her go
Paul stood easily left hand in pants pocket brought the gun up and
tightened on the trigger He frowned and pressed again
He scowled at Derek Stevens Its not loaded
Stevens grunted amusement Look at the target First time you got it
right over the heart
Ill be  Paul began He looked down at the weapon in surprise
Noiseless and recoilless What caliber is it Derek and whats the
muzzle velocity
We call it the 38 Noiseless Stevens said It has the punch of that
44 Magnum youre presently carrying
With a fluid motion Paul Koslov produced the 44 Magnum from the holster
under his left shoulder and tossed it to one side Thats the last time
I tote that cannon he said He balanced the new gun in his hand in
admiration Have the front sight taken off for me Derek and the fore
part of the trigger guard I need a quick draw gun He added absently
How did you know I carried a 44
Stevens said Youre rather famous Koslov The Colonel Lawrence of the
Cold War The journalists are kept from getting very much about you but
what they do learn they spread around
Paul Koslov said flatly Why dont you like me Stevens In this game I
dont appreciate people on our team who dont like me Its dangerous
Derek Stevens flushed I didnt say I didnt like you
You didnt have to
Its nothing personal Stevens said
Paul Koslov looked at him
Stevens said I dont approve of Americans committing political
assassinations
Paul Koslov grinned wolfishly and without humor Youll have a hard
time proving that even our cloak and dagger department has ever
authorized assassination Stevens By the way Im not an American
Derek Stevens was not the type of man whose jaw dropped but he blinked
Then what are you
A Russian Paul snapped And look Stevens were busy now but when
youve got some time to do a little thinking consider the ethics of
warfare
Stevens was flushed again at the tone Ethics of warfare
There arent any Paul Koslov snapped There hasnt been chivalry in
war for a long time and there probably never will be again Neither
side can afford it And Im talking about cold war as well as hot He
scowled at the other Or did you labor under the illusion that only the
Commies had tough operators on their side
Paul Koslov crossed the Atlantic in a supersonic TU180 operated by
Europa Airways That in itself galled him It was bad enough that the
Commies had stolen a march on the West with the first jet liner to go
into mass production the TU104 back in 1957 By the time the United
States brought out its first really practical transAtlantic jets in
1959 the Russians had come up with the TU114 which its designer old
Andrei Tupolev named the largest most efficient and economical
aircraft flying
In civil aircraft they had got ahead and stayed ahead Subsidized beyond
anything the West could or at least would manage the air lines of the
world couldnt afford to operate the slower smaller and more expensive
Western models One by one first the neutrals such as India and then
even members of the Western bloc began equipping their air lines with
Russian craft
Paul grunted his disgust at the memory of the strong measures that had
to be taken by the government to prevent even some of the American lines
from buying Soviet craft at the unbelievably low prices they offered
them
In London he presented a card on which he had added a numbered code in
pencil Handed it over a desk to the British intelligence major
I believe Im expected Paul said
The major looked at him then down at the card Just a moment Mr
Smith Ill see if his lordship is available Wont you take a chair
He left the room
Paul Koslov strolled over to the window and looked out on the moving
lines of pedestrians below He had first been in London some thirty
years ago So far as he could remember there were no noticeable changes
with the exception of automobile design He wondered vaguely how long it
took to make a noticeable change in the London street scene
The major reentered the room with a new expression of respect on his
face His lordship will see you immediately Mr Smith
Thanks Paul said He entered the inner office
Lord Carrol was attired in civilian clothes which somehow failed to
disguise a military quality in his appearance He indicated a chair next
to his desk Weve been instructed to give you every assistance Mr
Smith Frankly I cant imagine of just what this could consist
Paul said as he adjusted himself in the chair Im going into the
Soviet Union on an important assignment Ill need as large a team at my
disposal as we can manage You have agents in Russia of course He
lifted his eyebrows
His lordship cleared his throat and his voice went even stiffer All
major military nations have a certain number of espionage operatives in
each others countries No matter how peaceful the times this is
standard procedure
And these are hardly peaceful times Paul said dryly Ill want a
complete list of your Soviet based agents and the necessary information
on how to contact them
Lord Carrol stared at him Finally sputtered Man why Youre not
even a British national This is
Paul held up a hand Were cooperating with the Russian underground
Cooperating isnt quite strong enough a word Were going to push
them into activity if we can
The British intelligence head looked down at the card before him Mr
Smith he read He looked up John Smith I assume
Paul said still dryly Is there any other
Lord Carrol said See here youre really Paul Koslov arent you
Paul looked at him said nothing
Lord Carrol said impatiently What you ask is impossible Our
operatives all have their own assignments their own work Why do you
need them
This is the biggest job ever overthrowing the Soviet State We need as
many men as we can get on our team Possibly I wont have to use them
but if I do I want them available
The Britisher rapped You keep mentioning our team but according to
the dossier we carry on you Mr Koslov you are neither British nor
even a Yankee And you ask me to turn over our complete Soviet
machinery
Paul came to his feet and leaned over the desk there was a paleness
immediately beneath his ears and along his jaw line Listen he said
tightly if Im not on this team there just is no team Just a
pretense of one When theres a real team there has to be a certain
spirit A team spirit I dont care if youre playing cricket football
or international cold war If theres one thing thats important to me
that Ive based my whole life upon its this understand Ive got
team spirit Perhaps no one else in the whole West has it but I do
Inwardly Lord Carrol was boiling He snapped Youre neither British
nor American In other words you are a mercenary How do we know that
the Russians wont offer you double or triple what the Yankees pay for
your services
Paul sat down again and looked at his watch My time is limited he
said I have to leave for Paris this afternoon and be in Bonn tomorrow
I dont care what opinions you might have in regard to my mercenary
motives Lord Carrol Ive just come from Downing Street I suggest you
make a phone call there At the request of Washington your government
has given me carte blanche in this matter
Paul flew into Moscow in an Aeroflot jet landing at Vnukovo airport on
the outskirts of the city He entered as an American businessman a
camera importer who was also interested in doing a bit of tourist
sightseeing He was traveling deluxe category which entitled him to a
Zil complete with chauffeur and an interpreterguide when he had need of
one He was quartered in the Ukrayna on Dorogomilovskaya Quai a
twentyeight floor skyscraper with a thousand rooms
It was Pauls first visit to Moscow but he wasnt particularly thrown
off He kept up with developments and was aware of the fact that as
early as the late 1950s the Russians had begun to lick the problems of
ample food clothing and finally shelter Even those products once
considered sheer luxuries were now in abundant supply If material
things alone had been all that counted the Soviet man in the street
wasnt doing so badly
He spent the first several days getting the feel of the city and also
making his preliminary business calls He was interested in a new
automated camera currently being touted by the Russians as the worlds
best Fastest lens foolproof operation guaranteed for the life of the
owner and retailing for exactly twentyfive dollars
He was told as expected that the factory and distribution point was in
Leningrad and given instructions and letters of introduction
On the fifth day he took the Red Arrow Express to Leningrad and
established himself at the Astoria Hotel 39 Hertzen Street It was one
of the many of the Intourist hotels going back to before the revolution
He spent the next day allowing his guide to show him the standard
tourist sights The Winter Palace where the Bolshevik revolution was
won when the mutinied cruiser Aurora steamed up the river and shelled
it The Hermitage Museum rivaled only by the Vatican and Louvre The
Alexandrovskaya Column the worlds tallest monolithic stone monument
The modest personal palace of Peter the Great The Peter and Paul
Cathedral The kingsize Kirov Stadium The Leningrad subway as much a
museum as a system of transportation
He saw it all tourist fashion and wondered inwardly what the Intourist
guide would have thought had he known that this was Mr John Smiths
home town
The day following he turned his business problem over to the guide He
wanted to meet lets see now oh yes here it is Leonid Shvernik of
the Mikoyan Camera works Could it be arranged
Of course it could be arranged The guide went into five minutes of
oratory on the desire of the Soviet Union to trade with the West and
thus spread everlasting peace
An interview was arranged for Mr Smith with Mr Shvernik for that
afternoon
Mr Smith met Mr Shvernik in the latters office at two and they went
through the usual amenities Mr Shvernik spoke excellent English so Mr
Smith was able to dismiss his interpreterguide for the afternoon When
he was gone and they were alone Mr Shvernik went into his sales talk
I can assure you sir that not since the Japanese startled the world
with their new cameras shortly after the Second War has any such
revolution in design and quality taken place The Mikoyan is not only
the best camera produced anywhere but since our plant is fully
automated we can sell it for a fraction the cost of German Japanese or
American
Paul Koslov came to his feet walked quietly over to one of the pictures
hanging on the wall lifted it pointed underneath and raised his
eyebrows at the other
Leonid Shvernik leaned back in his chair shocked
Paul remained there until at last the other shook his head
Paul said in English Are you absolutely sure
Yes Shvernik said There are no microphones in here I absolutely
know Who are you
Paul said In the movement they call you Georgi and youre top man in
the Leningrad area
Shverniks hand came up from under the desk and he pointed a heavy
military revolver at his visitor Who are you he repeated
Paul ignored the gun Someone who knows that you are Georgi he said
Im from America Is there any chance of anybody intruding
Yes one of my colleagues Or perhaps a secretary
Illustration
Then I suggest we go to a bar or some place for a drink or a cup of
coffee or whatever the current Russian equivalent might be
Shvernik looked at him searchingly Yes he said finally Theres a
place down the street He began to stick the gun in his waistband
changed his mind and put it back into the desk drawer
As soon as they were on the open street and out of earshot of other
pedestrians Paul said Would you rather I spoke Russian I have the
feeling that wed draw less attention than if we speak English
Shvernik said tightly Do the Intourist people know you speak Russian
If not stick to English Now how do you know my name I have no
contacts with the Americans
I got it through my West German contacts
The Russians face registered unsuppressed fury Do they ignore the
simplest of precautions Do they reveal me to every source that asks
Paul said mildly Herr Ludwig is currently under my direction Your
secret is as safe as it has ever been
The underground leader remained silent for a long moment Youre an
American eh and Ludwig told you about me What do you want now
To help Paul Koslov said
How do you mean to help How can you help I dont know what youre
talking about
Help in any way you want Money printing presses mimeograph machines
radio transmitters weapons manpower in limited amounts knowhow
training anything you need to help overthrow the Soviet government
They had reached the restaurant Leonid Shvernik became the Russian
export official He ushered his customer to a secluded table Saw him
comfortably into his chair
Do you actually know anything about cameras he asked
Yes Paul said were thorough I can buy cameras from you and
theyll be marketed in the States
Good The waiter was approaching Shvernik said Have you ever eaten
caviar Russian style
I dont believe so Paul said Im not very hungry
Nothing to do with hunger Shvernik said From the waiter he ordered
raisin bread sweet butter caviar and a carafe of vodka
The waiter went off for it and Shvernik said To what extent are you
willing to help us Money for instance What kind of money rubles
dollars And how much A revolutionary movement can always use money
Any kind Paul said flatly and any amount
Shvernik was impressed He said eagerly Any amount within reason eh
Paul looked into his face and said flatly Any amount period It
doesnt have to be particularly reasonable Our only qualification would
be a guarantee it is going into the attempt to overthrow the
Sovietsnot into private pockets
The waiter was approaching Shvernik drew some brochures from his
pocket spread them before Paul Koslov and began to point out with a
fountain pen various features of the Mikoyan camera
The waiter put the order on the table and stood by for a moment for
further orders
Shvernik said First you take a sizable portion of vodka like this
He poured them two jolts And drink it down ah bottoms up you
Americans say Then you spread butter on a small slice of raisin bread
and cover it with a liberal portion of caviar Good Then you eat your
little sandwich and drink another glass of vodka Then you start all
over again
I can see it could be fairly easy to get stoned eating caviar Russian
style Paul laughed
They went through the procedure and the waiter wandered off
Paul said I can take several days arranging the camera deal with you
Then I can take a tour of the country supposedly giving it a tourist
looksee but actually making contact with more of your organization I
can then return in the future supposedly to make further orders I can
assure you these cameras are going to sell very well in the States
Ill be coming back time and againfor business reasons Meanwhile do
you have any members among the interpreterguides in the local Intourist
offices
Shvernik nodded Yes And yes that would be a good idea Well assign
Ana Furtseva to you if we can arrange it And possibly she can even
have a chauffeur assigned you wholl also be one of our people
That was the first time Paul Koslov heard the name Ana Furtseva
In the morning Leonid Shvernik came to the hotel in a Mikoyan Camera
Works car loaded with cameras and the various accessories that were
available for the basic model He began gushing the advantages of the
Mikoyan before they were well out of the hotel
The last thing he said as they trailed out of the hotels portals was
Well drive about town giving you an opportunity to do some snapshots
and then possibly to my country dacha where we can have lunch
At the car he said May I introduce Ana Furtseva whos been assigned
as your guideinterpreter by Intourist for the balance of your stay
Ana Mr John Smith
Paul shook hands
She was blond as almost all Russian girls are blond and with the
startling blue eyes A touch chubby by Western standards but less so
than the Russian average She had a disturbing pixie touch around the
mouth out of place in a dedicated revolutionist
The car took off with Shvernik at the wheel Youre actually going to
have to take pictures as we go along Well have them developed later at
the plant Ive told them that you are potentially a very big order
Possibly theyll try and assign one of my superiors to your account
after a day or two If so I suggest that you merely insist that you
feel I am competent and you would rather continue with me
Of course Paul said Now then how quickly can our assistance to you
get underway
The question is Shvernik said just how much you can do in the way
of helping our movement For instance can you get advanced type weapons
to us
The 38 Noiseless slid easily into Pauls hands Obviously we cant
smuggle sizable military equipment across the border But here for
instance is a noiseless recoilless hand gun We could deliver any
reasonable amount within a month
Five thousand Shvernik asked
I think so Youd have to cover once they got across the border of
course How well organized are you If you arent possibly we can help
there but not in time to get five thousand guns to you in a month
Ana was puzzled How could you possibly get that number across the
Soviet borders Her voice had a disturbing Slavic throatiness It
occurred to Paul Koslov that she was one of the most attractive women he
had ever met He was amused Women had never played a great part in his
life There had never been anyone who had really basically appealed
But evidently blood was telling Here he had to come back to Russia to
find such attractiveness
He said The Yugoslavs are comparatively open and smuggling across the
Adriatic from Italy commonplace Wed bring the things you want in that
way Yugoslavia and Poland are on good terms currently with lots of
trade Wed ship them by rail from Yugoslavia to Warsaw Trade between
Poland and USSR is on massive scale Our agents in Warsaw would send
on the guns in well concealed shipments Freight cars arent searched at
the PolishRussian border However your agents would have to pick up
the deliveries in Brest or Kobryn before they got as far as Pinsk
Ana said her voice very low Visiting in Sweden at the Soviet Embassy
in Stockholm is a colonel who is at the head of the Leningrad branch of
the KGB department in charge of counterrevolution as they call it Can
you eliminate him
Is it necessary Are you sure that if its done it might not raise such
a stink that the KGB might concentrate more attention on you Paul
didnt like this sort of thing It seldom accomplished anything
Ana said He knows that both Georgi and I are members of the movement
Paul Koslov gaped at her You mean your position is known to the
police
Shvernik said Thus far he has kept the information to himself He
found out when Ana tried to enlist his services
Pauls eyes went from one to the other of them in disbelief Enlist his
services How do you know he hasnt spilled everything What do you mean
hes kept the information to himself so far
Ana said her voice so low as to be hardly heard Hes my older
brother Im his favorite sister How much longer he will keep our
secret I dont know Under the circumstances I can think of no answer
except that he be eliminated
It came to Paul Koslov that the team on this side could be just as
dedicated as he was to his own particular cause
He said A Colonel Furtseva at the Soviet Embassy in Stockholm Very
well A Hungarian refugee will probably be best If hes caught the
reason for the killing wont point in your direction
Yes Ana said her sensitive mouth twisting In fact Anastas was in
Budapest during the suppression there in 1956 He participated
The dacha of Leonid Shvernik was in the vicinity of Petrodvorets on the
Gulf of Finland about eighteen miles from Leningrad proper It would
have been called a summer bungalow in the States On the rustic side
Three bedrooms a moderately large livingdining room kitchen bath
even a car port Paul Koslov took a mild satisfaction in deciding that
an American in Shverniks equivalent job could have afforded more of a
place than this
Shvernik was saying I hope it never gets to the point where you have
to go on the run If it does this house is a center of our activities
At any time you can find clothing here weapons money food Even a
