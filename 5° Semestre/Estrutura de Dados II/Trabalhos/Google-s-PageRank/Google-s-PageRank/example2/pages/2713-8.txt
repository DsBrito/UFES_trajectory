I think that Quatermain heard him too though he said nothing The wind
was rising every minute and by the time the beat begun it blew big
guns I stood at the righthand corner of the spinney which curved
round somewhat and Quatermain stood at the left about forty paces from
me Presently an old cock pheasant came rocketing over me looking as
though the feathers were being blown out of his tail I missed him clean
with the first barrel and was never more pleased with myself in my life
than when I doubled him up with the second for the shot was not an
easy one In the faint light I could see Quatermain nodding his head in
approval when through the groaning of the trees I heard the shouts of
the beaters Cock forward cock to the right Then came a whole volley
of shouts Woodcock to the right Cock to the left Cock over
I looked up and presently caught sight of one of the woodcocks coming
down the wind upon me like a flash In that dim light I could not follow
all his movements as he zigzagged through the naked treetops indeed I
could see him when his wings flitted up Now he was passing mebang
and a flick of the wing I had missed him bang again Surely he was
down no there he went to my left
Cock to you I shouted stepping forward so as to get Quatermain
between me and the faint angry light of the dying day for I wanted to
see if he would wipe my eye I knew him to be a wonderful shot but I
thought that cock would puzzle him
I saw him raise his gun ever so little and bend forward and at that
moment out flashed two woodcocks into the open the one I had missed to
his right and the other to his left
At the same time a fresh shout arose of Woodcock over and looking
down the spinney I saw a third bird high up in the air being blown
along like a brown and whirling leaf straight over Quatermains head
And then followed the prettiest little bit of shooting that I ever saw
The bird to the right was flying low not ten yards from the line of
a hedgerow and Quatermain took him first because he would become
invisible the soonest of any Indeed nobody who had not his hawks eyes
could have seen to shoot at all But he saw the bird well enough to kill
it dead as a stone Then turning sharply he pulled on the second bird
at about fortyfive yards and over he went By this time the third
woodcock was nearly over him and flying very high straight down the
wind a hundred feet up or more I should say I saw him glance at it as
he opened his gun threw out the right cartridge and slipped in another
turning round as he did so By this time the cock was nearly fifty yards
away from him and travelling like a flash Lifting his gun he fired
after it and wonderful as the shot was killed it dead A tearing gust
of wind caught the dead bird and blew it away like a leaf torn from an
oak so that it fell a hundred and thirty yards off or more
I say Quatermain I said to him when the beaters were up do you
often do this sort of thing
Well he answered with a dry smile the last time I had to load
three shots as quickly as that was at rather larger game It was at
elephants I killed them all three as dead as I killed those woodcocks
but it very nearly went the other way I can tell you I mean that they
very nearly killed me
Just at that moment the keeper came up Did you happen to get one of
them there cocks sir he said with the air of a man who did not in
the least expect an answer in the affirmative
Well yes Jeffries answered Quatermain you will find one of them
by the hedge and another about fifty yards out by the plough there to
the left
The keeper had turned to go looking a little astonished when
Quatermain called him back
Stop a bit Jeffries he said You see that pollard about one hundred
and forty yards off Well there should be another woodcock down in a
line with it about sixty paces out in the field
Well if that beant the very smartest bit of shooting murmured
Jeffries and departed
After that we went home and in due course Sir Henry Curtis and Captain
Good arrived for dinner the latter arrayed in the tightest and most
ornamental dresssuit I ever saw I remember that the waistcoat was
adorned with five pink coral buttons
It was a very pleasant dinner Old Quatermain was in an excellent
humour induced I think by the recollection of his triumph over the
doubting Jeffries Good too was full of anecdotes He told us a most
miraculous story of how he once went shooting ibex in Kashmir These
ibex according to Good he stalked early and late for four entire days
At last on the morning of the fifth day he succeeded in getting within
range of the flock which consisted of a magnificent old ram with horns
so long that I am afraid to mention their measure and five or six
females Good crawled upon his stomach painfully taking shelter behind
rocks till he was within two hundred yards then he drew a fine bead
upon the old ram At this moment however a diversion occurred Some
wandering native of the hills appeared upon a distant mountain top The
females turned and rushing over a rock vanished from Goods ken But
the old ram took a bolder course In front of him stretched a mighty
crevasse at least thirty feet in width He went at it with a bound
Whilst he was in midair Good fired and killed him dead The ram turned
a complete somersault in space and fell in such fashion that his horns
hooked themselves upon a big projection of the opposite cliffs There he
hung till Good after a long and painful detour gracefully dropped a
lasso over him and fished him up
This moving tale of wild adventure was received with undeserved
incredulity
Well said Good if you fellows wont believe my story when I tell
ita perfectly true story mindperhaps one of you will give us a
better Im not particular if it is true or not And he lapsed into a
dignified silence
Now Quatermain I said dont let Good beat you let us hear how you
killed those elephants you were talking about this evening just after
you shot the woodcocks
Well said Quatermain dryly and with something like a twinkle in
his brown eyes it is very hard fortune for a man to have to follow on
Goods spoor Indeed if it were not for that running giraffe which as
you will remember Curtis we saw Good bowl over with a Martini rifle
at three hundred yards I should almost have said that this was an
impossible tale
Here Good looked up with an air of indignant innocence
However he went on rising and lighting his pipe if you fellows
like I will spin you a yarn I was telling one of you the other night
about those three lions and how the lioness finished my unfortunate
voorlooper JimJim the boy whom we buried in the breadbag
Well after this little experience I thought that I would settle down a
bit so I entered upon a venture with a man who being of a speculative
mind had conceived the idea of running a store at Pretoria upon
strictly cash principles The arrangement was that I should find
the capital and he the experience Our partnership was not of a long
duration The Boers refused to pay cash and at the end of four months
my partner had the capital and I had the experience After this I came
to the conclusion that storekeeping was not in my line and having
four hundred pounds left I sent my boy Harry to a school in Natal and
buying an outfit with what remained of the money started upon a big
trip
This time I determined to go further afield than I had ever been
before so I took a passage for a few pounds in a trading brig that
ran between Durban and Delagoa Bay From Delagoa Bay I marched inland
accompanied by twenty porters with the idea of striking up north
towards the Limpopo and keeping parallel to the coast but at a
distance of about one hundred and fifty miles from it For the first
twenty days of our journey we suffered a good deal from fever that is
my men did for I think that I am fever proof Also I was hard put to
it to keep the camp in meat for although the country proved to be very
sparsely populated there was but little game about Indeed during all
that time I hardly killed anything larger than a waterbuck and as you
know waterbucks flesh is not very appetising food On the twentieth
day however we came to the banks of a largish river the Gonooroo it
was called This I crossed and then struck inland towards a great range
of mountains the blue crests of which we could see lying on the distant
heavens like a shadow a continuation as I believe of the Drakensberg
range that skirts the coast of Natal From this main range a great spur
shoots out some fifty miles or so towards the coast ending abruptly in
one tremendous peak This spur I discovered separated the territories of
two chiefs named Nala and Wambe Wambes territory being to the north
and Nalas to the south Nala ruled a tribe of bastard Zulus called
the Butiana and Wambe a much larger tribe called the Matuku which
presents marked Bantu characteristics For instance they have doors and
verandahs to their huts work skins perfectly and wear a waistcloth and
not a moocha At this time the Butiana were more or less subject to
the Matuku having been surprised by them some twenty years before
and mercilessly slaughtered down The tribe was now recovering itself
however and as you may imagine it did not love the Matuku
Well I heard as I went along that elephants were very plentiful in the
dense forests which lie upon the slopes and at the foot of the mountains
that border Wambes territory Also I heard a very ill report of that
worthy himself who lived in a kraal upon the side of the mountain
which was so strongly fortified as to be practically impregnable It was
said that he was the most cruel chief in this part of Africa and that
he had murdered in cold blood an entire party of English gentlemen who
some seven years before had gone into his country to hunt elephants
They took an old friend of mine with them as guide John Every by name
and often had I mourned over his untimely death All the same Wambe
or no Wambe I determined to hunt elephants in his country I never was
afraid of natives and I was not going to show the white feather now I
am a bit of a fatalist as you fellows know so I came to the conclusion
that if it was fated that Wambe should send me to join my old friend
John Every I should have to go and there was an end of it Meanwhile
I meant to hunt elephants with a peaceful heart
On the third day from the date of our sighting the great peak we found
ourselves beneath its shadow Still following the course of the river
which wound through the forests at the base of the peak we entered the
territory of the redoubtable Wambe This however was not accomplished
without a certain difference of opinion between my bearers and myself
for when we reached the spot where Wambes boundary was supposed to run
the bearers sat down and emphatically refused to go a step further I
sat down too and argued with them putting my fatalistic views before
them as well as I was able But I could not persuade them to look at
the matter in the same light At present they said their skins were
whole if they went into Wambes country without his leave they would
soon be like a watereaten leaf It was very well for me to say that
this would be Fate Fate no doubt might be walking about in Wambes
country but while they stopped outside they would not meet him
Well I said to Gobo my head man and what do you mean to do
We mean to go back to the coast Macumazahn he answered insolently
Do you I replied for my bile was stirred At any rate Mr Gobo
you and one or two others will never get there see here my friend
and I took a repeating rifle and sat myself comfortably down resting my
back against a treeI have just breakfasted and I had as soon spend
the day here as anywhere else Now if you or any of those men walk one
step back from here and towards the coast I shall fire at you and you
know that I dont miss
The man fingered the spear he was carryingluckily all my guns were
stacked against the treeand then turned as though to walk away the
others keeping their eyes fixed upon him all the while I rose and
covered him with the rifle and though he kept up a brave appearance of
unconcern I saw that he was glancing nervously at me all the time When
he had gone about twenty yards I spoke very quietly
Now Gobo I said come back or I shall fire
Of course this was taking a very high hand I had no real right to kill
Gobo or anybody else because they objected to run the risk of death by
entering the territory of a hostile chief But I felt that if I wished
to keep up any authority it was absolutely necessary that I should push
matters to the last extremity short of actually shooting him So I sat
there looking fierce as a lion and keeping the sight of my rifle in
a dead line for Gobos ribs Then Gobo feeling that the situation was
getting strained gave in
Dont shoot Boss he shouted throwing up his hand I will come
with you
I thought you would I answered quietly you see Fate walks about
outside Wambes country as well as in it
After that I had no more trouble for Gobo was the ringleader and when
he collapsed the others collapsed also Harmony being thus restored we
crossed the line and on the following morning I began shooting in good
earnest
IIA MORNINGS SPORT
Moving some five or six miles round the base of the great peak of
which I have spoken we came the same day to one of the fairest bits of
African country that I have seen outside of Kukuanaland At this spot
the mountain spur that runs out at right angles to the great range
which stretches its cloudclad length north and south as far as the eye
can reach sweeps inwards with a vast and splendid curve This curve
measures some fiveandthirty miles from point to point and across
its moonlike segment the river flashed a silver line of light On the
further side of the river is a measureless sea of swelling ground a
natural park covered with great patches of bushsome of them being many
square miles in extent These are separated one from another by glades
of grass land broken here and there with clumps of timber trees and in
some instances by curious isolated koppies and even by single crags of
granite that start up into the air as though they were monuments carved
by man and not tombstones set by nature over the grave of ages gone On
the west this beautiful plain is bordered by the lonely mountain from
the edge of which it rolls down toward the fever coast but how far it
runs to the north I cannot sayeight days journey according to the
natives when it is lost in an untravelled morass
On the hither side of the river the scenery is different Along the
edge of its banks where the land is flat are green patches of swamp
Then comes a wide belt of beautiful grass land covered thickly with
game and sloping up very gently to the borders of the forest which
beginning at about a thousand feet above the level of the plain clothes
the mountainside almost to its crest In this forest grow great trees
most of them of the yellowwood species Some of these trees are so
lofty that a bird in their top branches would be out of range of an
ordinary shot gun Another peculiar thing about them is that they are
for the most part covered with a dense growth of the Orchilla moss and
from this moss the natives manufacture a most excellent deep purple dye
with which they stain tanned hides and also cloth when they happen
to get any of the latter I do not think that I ever saw anything more
remarkable than the appearance of one of these mighty trees festooned
from top to bottom with trailing wreaths of this sadhued moss in which
the wind whispers gently as it stirs them At a distance it looks like
the gray locks of a Titan crowned with bright green leaves and here and
there starred with the rich bloom of orchids
The night of that day on which I had my little difference of opinion
with Gobo we camped by the edge of this great forest and on the
following morning at daylight I started out shooting As we were short
of meat I determined to kill a buffalo of which there were plenty
about before looking for traces of elephants Not more than half a mile
from camp we came across a trail broad as a cartroad evidently made by
a great herd of buffaloes which had passed up at dawn from their feeding
ground in the marshes to spend the day in the cool air of the uplands
This trail I followed boldly for such wind as there was blew straight
down the mountainside that is from the direction in which the
buffaloes had gone to me About a mile further on the forest began to
be dense and the nature of the trail showed me that I must be close to
my game Another two hundred yards and the bush was so thick that had
it not been for the trail we could scarcely have passed through it
As it was Gobo who carried my eightbore rifle for I had the
570express in my hand and the other two men whom I had taken with
me showed the very strongest dislike to going any further pointing
out that there was no room to run away I told them that they need
not come unless they liked but that I was certainly going on and then
growing ashamed they came
Another fifty yards and the trail opened into a little glade I knelt
down and peeped and peered but no buffalo could I see Evidently the
herd had broken up hereI knew that from the spoorand penetrated the
opposite bush in little troops I crossed the glade and choosing one
line of spoor followed it for some sixty yards when it became clear
to me that I was surrounded by buffaloes and yet so dense was the
cover that I could not see any A few yards to my left I could hear one
rubbing its horns against a tree while from my right came an occasional
low and throaty grunt which told me that I was uncomfortably near an
old bull I crept on towards him with my heart in my mouth as gently as
though I were walking upon eggs for a bet lifting every little bit of
wood in my path and placing it behind me lest it should crack and warn
the game After me in single file came my three retainers and I dont
know which of them looked the most frightened Presently Gobo touched my
leg I glanced round and saw him pointing slantwise towards the left
I lifted my head a little and peeped over a mass of creepers beyond the
creepers was a dense bush of sharppointed aloes of that kind of which
the leaves project laterally and on the other side of the aloes not
fifteen paces from us I made out the horns neck and the ridge of the
back of a tremendous old bull I took my eightbore and getting on
to my knee prepared to shoot him through the neck taking my chance of
cutting his spine I had already covered him as well as the aloe leaves
would allow when he gave a kind of sigh and lay down
I looked round in dismay What was to be done now I could not see
to shoot him lying down even if my bullet would have pierced the
intervening aloeswhich was doubtfuland if I stood up he would either
run away or charge me I reflected and came to the conclusion that the
only thing to do was to lie down also for I did not fancy wandering
after other buffaloes in that dense bush If a buffalo lies down it
is clear that he must get up again some time so it was only a case of
patiencefighting the fight of sit down as the Zulus say
Accordingly I sat down and lighted a pipe thinking that the smell of
it might reach the buffalo and make him get up But the wind was the
wrong way and it did not so when it was done I lit another Afterwards
I had cause to regret that pipe
Well we squatted like this for between half and three quarters of an
hour till at length I began to grow heartily sick of the performance
It was about as dull a business as the last hour of a comic opera
I could hear buffaloes snorting and moving all round and see the
redbeaked tic birds flying up off their backs making a kind of hiss
as they did so something like that of the English misselthrush but I
could not see a single buffalo As for my old bull I think he must have
slept the sleep of the just for he never even stirred
Just as I was making up my mind that something must be done to save the
situation my attention was attracted by a curious grinding noise
At first I thought that it must be a buffalo chewing the cud but was
obliged to abandon the idea because the noise was too loud I shifted
myself round and stared through the cracks in the bush in the direction
whence the sound seemed to come and once I thought that I saw something
gray moving about fifty yards off but could not make certain Although
the grinding noise still continued I could see nothing more so I gave
up thinking about it and once again turned my attention to the buffalo
Presently however something happened Suddenly from about forty yards
away there came a tremendous snorting sound more like that made by
an engine getting a heavy train under weigh than anything else in the
world
By Jove I thought turning round in the direction from which the
grinding sound had come that must be a rhinoceros and he has got our
wind For as you fellows know there is no mistaking the sound made by
a rhinoceros when he gets wind of you
Another second and I heard a most tremendous crashing noise Before I
could think what to do before I could even get up the bush behind me
seemed to burst asunder and there appeared not eight yards from us
the great horn and wicked twinkling eye of a charging rhinoceros He
had winded us or my pipe I do not know which and after the fashion
of these brutes had charged up the scent I could not rise I could
not even get the gun up I had no time All that I was able to do was
to roll over as far out of the monsters path as the bush would allow
Another second and he was over me his great bulk towering above me
like a mountain and upon my word I could not get his smell out of my
nostrils for a week Circumstances impressed it on my memory at least I
suppose so His hot breath blew upon my face one of his front feet just
missed my head and his hind one actually trod upon the loose part of
my trousers and pinched a little bit of my skin I saw him pass over me
lying as I was upon my back and next second I saw something else My
men were a little behind me and therefore straight in the path of the
rhinoceros One of them flung himself backwards into the bush and thus
avoided him The second with a wild yell sprung to his feet and bounded
like an indiarubber ball right into the aloe bush landing well among
the spikes But the third it was my friend Gobo could not by any means
get away He managed to gain his feet and that was all The rhinoceros
was charging with his head low his horn passed between Gobos legs
and feeling something on his nose he jerked it up Away went Gobo high
into the air He turned a complete somersault at the apex of the curve
and as he did so I caught sight of his face It was gray with terror
and his mouth was wide open Down he came right on to the great brutes
back and that broke his fall Luckily for him the rhinoceros never
turned but crashed straight through the aloe bush only missing the man
who had jumped into it by about a yard
Then followed a complication The sleeping buffalo on the further side
of the bush hearing the noise sprang to his feet and for a second
not knowing what to do stood still At that instant the huge rhinoceros
blundered right on to him and getting his horn beneath his stomach gave
him such a fearful dig that the buffalo was turned over on to his back
while his assailant went a most amazing cropper over his carcase In
another moment however the rhinoceros was up and wheeling round
to the left crashed through the bush downhill and towards the open
country
Instantly the whole place became alive with alarming sounds In every
direction troops of snorting buffaloes charged through the forest wild
with fright while the injured bull on the further side of the bush
began to bellow like a mad thing I lay quite still for a moment
devoutly praying that none of the flying buffaloes would come my way
Then when the danger lessened I got on to my feet shook myself and
looked round One of my boys he who had thrown himself backward into
the bush was already half way up a treeif heaven had been at the top
of it he could not have climbed quicker Gobo was lying close to me
groaning vigorously but as I suspected quite unhurt while from the
aloe bush into which No 3 had bounded like a tennis ball issued a
succession of the most piercing yells
I looked and saw that this unfortunate fellow was in a very tight
place A great spike of aloe had run through the back of his skin
waistbelt though without piercing his flesh in such a fashion that it
was impossible for him to move while within six feet of him the injured
buffalo bull thinking no doubt that he was the aggressor bellowed
and ramped to get at him tearing the thick aloes with his great horns
That no time was to be lost if I wished to save the mans life was
very clear So seizing my eightbore which was fortunately uninjured I
took a pace to the left for the rhinoceros had enlarged the hole in the
bush and aimed at the point of the buffalos shoulder since on account
of my position I could not get a fair side shot for the heart As I did
so I saw that the rhinoceros had given the bull a tremendous wound
in the stomach and that the shock of the encounter had put his left
hindleg out of joint at the hip I fired and the bullet striking the
shoulder broke it and knocked the buffalo down I knew that he could
not get up any more because he was now injured fore and aft so
notwithstanding his terrific bellows I scrambled round to where he was
There he lay glaring furiously and tearing up the soil with his horns
Stepping up to within two yards of him I aimed at the vertebra of his
neck and fired The bullet struck true and with a thud he dropped his
head upon the ground groaned and died
This little matter having been attended to with the assistance of
Gobo who had now found his feet I went on to extricate our unfortunate
companion from the aloe bush This we found a thorny task but at last
he was dragged forth uninjured though in a very pious and prayerful
frame of mind His spirit had certainly looked that way he said
or he would now have been dead As I never like to interfere with true
piety I did not venture to suggest that his spirit had deigned to make
use of my eightbore in his interest
Having despatched this boy back to the camp to tell the bearers to come
and cut the buffalo up I bethought me that I owed that rhinoceros a
grudge which I should love to repay So without saying a word of what
was in my mind to Gobo who was now more than ever convinced that Fate
walked about loose in Wambes country I just followed on the brutes
spoor He had crashed through the bush till he reached the little glade
Then moderating his pace somewhat he had followed the glade down its
entire length and once more turned to the right through the forest
shaping his course for the open land that lies between the edge of the
bush and the river Having followed him for a mile or so further I
found myself quite on the open I took out my glasses and searched
the plain About a mile ahead was something brownas I thought the
rhinoceros I advanced another quarter of a mile and looked once
moreit was not the rhinoceros but a big antheap This was puzzling
but I did not like to give it up because I knew from his spoor that he
must be somewhere ahead But as the wind was blowing straight from me
towards the line that he had followed and as a rhinoceros can smell you
for about a mile it would not I felt be safe to follow his trail
any further so I made a detour of a mile and more till I was nearly
opposite the antheap and then once more searched the plain It was no
good I could see nothing of him and was about to give it up and start
after some oryx I saw on the skyline when suddenly at a distance of
about three hundred yards from the antheap and on its further side I
saw my rhino stand up in a patch of grass
Heavens I thought to myself hes off again but no after
standing staring for a minute or two he once more lay down
Now I found myself in a quandary As you know a rhinoceros is a very
shortsighted brute indeed his sight is as bad as his scent is good
Of this fact he is perfectly aware but he always makes the most of his
natural gifts For instance when he lies down he invariably does so
with his head down wind Thus if any enemy crosses his wind he will
still be able to escape or attack him and if on the other hand the
danger approaches up wind he will at least have a chance of seeing it
Otherwise by walking delicately one might actually kick him up like a
partridge if only the advance was made up wind
Well the point was how on earth should I get within shot of this
rhinoceros After much deliberation I determined to try a side approach
thinking that in this way I might get a shoulder shot Accordingly we
started in a crouching attitude I first Gobo holding on to my coat
tails and the other boy on to Gobos moocha I always adopt this plan
when stalking big game for if you follow any other system the bearers
will get out of line We arrived within three hundred yards safely
enough and then the real difficulties began The grass had been
so closely eaten off by game that there was scarcely any cover
Consequently it was necessary to go on to our hands and knees which
in my case involved laying down the eightbore at every step and then
lifting it up again However I wriggled along somehow and if it had
not been for Gobo and his friend no doubt everything would have gone
well But as you have I dare say observed a native out stalking is
always of that mind which is supposed to actuate an ostrichso long as
his head is hidden he seems to think that nothing else can be seen So
it was in this instance Gobo and the other boy crept along on their
hands and toes with their heads well down but though unfortunately
I did not notice it till too late bearing the fundamental portions of
their frames high in the air Now all animals are quite as suspicious of
this end of mankind as they are of his face and of that fact I soon had
a proof Just when we had got within about two hundred yards and I was
congratulating myself that I had not had this long crawl with the sun
beating on the back of my neck like a furnace for nothing I heard the
hissing note of the rhinoceros birds and up flew four or five of them
from the brutes back where they had been comfortably employed in
catching tics Now this performance on the part of the birds is to a
rhinoceros what the word cave is to a schoolboyit puts him on the
qui vive at once Before the birds were well in the air I saw the
grass stir
Down you go I whispered to the boys and as I did so the rhinoceros
got up and glared suspiciously around But he could see nothing indeed
if we had been standing up I doubt if he would have seen us at that
distance so he merely gave two or three sniffs and then lay down his
head still down wind the birds once more settling on his back
But it was clear to me that he was sleeping with one eye open being
generally in a suspicious and unchristian frame of mind and that it
was useless to proceed further on this stalk so we quietly withdrew
to consider the position and study the ground The results were not
satisfactory There was absolutely no cover about except the antheap
which was some three hundred yards from the rhinoceros upon his upwind
side I knew that if I tried to stalk him in front I should fail and so
I should if I attempted to do so from the further sidehe or the birds
would see me so I came to a conclusion I would go to the antheap
which would give him my wind and instead of stalking him I would let
him stalk me It was a bold step and one which I should never advise a
hunter to take but somehow I felt as though rhino and I must play the
hand out
I explained my intentions to the men who both held up their arms in
horror Their fears for my safety were a little mitigated however when
I told them that I did not expect them to come with me
Gobo breathed a prayer that I might not meet Fate walking about and
the other one sincerely trusted that my spirit might look my way when
the rhinoceros charged and then they both departed to a place of
safety
Taking my eightbore and halfadozen spare cartridges in my pocket
I made a detour and reaching the antheap in safety lay down For a
moment the wind had dropped but presently a gentle puff of air passed
over me and blew on towards the rhinoceros By the way I wonder what
it is that smells so strong about a man Is it his body or his breath
