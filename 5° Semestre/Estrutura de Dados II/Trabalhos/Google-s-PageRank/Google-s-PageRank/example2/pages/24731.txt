THE TALE OF GRUNTY PIG
I
THE RUNT
He was the smallest of seven children At first his mother thought she
would call him Runty But she soon changed her mind about that for
she discovered that even if he was the runt of the family he had the
loudest grunt of all So the good lady made haste to slip a G in front
of the name Runty
There she exclaimed Grunty is a name that you ought to be proud
of It calls attention to your best point And if you keep on making as
much noise in the world as you do now maybe people wont notice that
youre a bit undersized You certainly sound as big as any little shote
I ever saw or heard
So that was settledthough Grunty Pig didnt care one way or another
He seemed to be interested in nothing but food There is no doubt that
he would have been willing to change his name a dozen times a day for
the slight bribe of a drink of warm milk
His mother sometimes said that he had the biggest appetiteas well as
the loudest gruntof all her seven children And she was glad that he
ate well because food was the very thing that would make him grow
You wont always be runty Grunty if you eat a plenty Mrs Pig often
told him And then he would grunt as if to say You dont need to
urge me Just give me a chance
Grunty Pig soon learned that being the smallest of the family had one
sad drawback His brothers and sisters all bigger than he could crowd
him away from the feeding trough And they not only could but they
often did Unless Grunty reached the trough among the first there was
never a place left where he could squirm in If he tried to eat at one
end of the trough he was sure to be shouldered away and go hungry
So whenever he did succeed in getting the first taste of a meal he took
pains to plant himself in the exact middle of the trough Then there
would be three other youngsters on each side of him all crowding
towards him And though he found it a bit hard to breathe under such a
squeezing at least he got his share of the food
Poor Mrs Pig Her children had frightful manners Though she talked
and talked to them about not crowding and about eating slowly and
about eating noiselessly the moment their food was poured into their
trough they forgot everything their mother had said
That is all but Grunty Pig If he happened to be left out in the cold
so to speak and had to stand and look on while his brothers and sister
stuffed themselves he couldnt help remembering his mothers remarks
about manners
Its awful to watch them he would gurgle I dont see how they can
be so boorish He thought there was no sadder sight than his six
brothers and sisters jostling one another over their food while he
couldnt find a place to push in among them
II
A NEW WAY TO EAT
One thing especially distressed Mrs Pig Her children would put
their fore feet right into the trough when they ate their meals out of
it Nothing she said to them made the slightest difference Even when
she told them that they were little pigs they didnt seem to care
Were all bigger than Grunty is said one of her sonsa bouncing
black youngster who was the most unruly of the litter
Youre all greedy Mrs Pig retorted Do try to restrain yourselves
when you eat Remembertheres plenty of time
But theres not always plenty of food Grunty Pig told his mother
Sometimes there isnt any left for me
I know said Mrs Pig I know that your brothers and sisters eat your
share whenever they can Farmer Green furnishes enough food for you all
And if you children didnt forget your manners everybody would get his
shareno more and no less
Now Mrs Pig was not the only one that noticed how piggish her
youngsters were at the trough One day Farmer Green himself remarked to
his son Johnnie as they leaned over the pen that that litter of pigs
did beat all he had ever seen
They come arunning at meal time as if they were half starved Its a
wonder they dont get in the trough all over
Johnnie Green liked to watch the pigs
That black fellows the greediest of the lot he declared Hes
getting to be the biggest Hes almost twice the size of the little
runt
The runt doesnt get his share said Farmer Green Well have to do
something to help him or hell never be worth his salt
Grunty Pig looked up at Farmer Green and gave a plaintive squeal as if
to say Hurry please Because Im always hungry
And Blackie his greedy brother looked up at Farmer Green too He said
nothing But his little eyes twinkled slyly And afterward he told his
brothers and sisters that Farmer Green neednt think he could keep him
from drinking all the skim milk he pleased
If Mother cant make me behave surely Farmer Green wont be able to
he boasted
Of course Blackie Pig was very young Otherwise he would never have
made such a silly remark And he soon learned that Farmer Green was more
than a match for him
The next day Farmer Green made a long lid that dropped over the feeding
trough and covered it completely And in the lid he cut seven holesone
for each of Mrs Pigs children
There was no more jostling at meal time There was a place for
everybody And Mrs Pig was delighted with the improvement When Farmer
Green filled the trough each of the children stuck his head through a
hole and ate in the most orderly fashion To be sure there was some
squealing and grunting and some snuffling and blowing But it seemed to
Mrs Pig that no youngsters could have behaved more beautifully
And Grunty liked the new way of eating too But Blackie made a great
fuss He complained because he couldnt stick his nose through two holes
at the same time
III
THE LOOSE BOARD
After Farmer Green put the lid with the holes in it over the top of the
feeding trough Grunty Pig began to grow At last he was getting as much
to eat as his brothers and sisters And the bigger he grew the more
food he wanted He was always on the watch for some extra tidbitalways
rooting about to find some dainty that others had overlooked Many a
delicious piece of carrot or turnip or potatoparing rewarded him for
his eager searching
Still Grunty Pig was far from satisfied He had a great longing to get
outside the pen where he lived with the rest of Mrs Pigs seven
children
Out in the wide world there must be many good things to eat he
thought Id like to find the place where the potatoparings grow
But of all this Grunty Pig said nothing to anyone If the chance ever
came to slip out of the pen he intended to take nobody with him He had
not yet caught up with his brothers and sisters in size even if he had
outstripped them in the matter of brains And he feared that any one of
them would crowd him away from the good things that he meant to find
beyond the walls of the pigsty
Little did Mrs Pig dream what plans filled the head of her son Grunty
When she saw him sniffing around the walls of the pen she never once
guessed that he could be looking for anything except something to eat
How could she know that Gruntythe littlest of the familywas
searching for a place to escape
Now it happened that there was one loose board in a corner of the
pigpen The nails that once held it had rusted away Nobody but Grunty
Pig had discovered that by pressing against an end of this board one
could bend it outward
It was too badfor himthat he had grown so rapidly Had he been just
a bit smaller he could have squeezed through the opening
Here Grunty met the first real problem of his life For some days he
puzzled over it One thing was certain he couldnt make himself
smaller unless he stopped eating And that was out of the question In
the end he made up his mind that there was only one thing to do he must
make the opening bigger
Day after day Grunty Pig crowded against the loose board And at last
came his reward Two more rusty nails gave way all at once Under
Gruntys weight the board opened wide And as he slipped through the
space to freedom the board snapped back into place again
There he was with the wide world before him And there was the pen
with no opening anywhere to be seen
With a grunt of delight Grunty Pig trotted out of the low building and
found himself on the edge of Farmer Greens orchard
He noticed that there was a fragrant smell of apples in the air
IV
THE WIDE WIDE WORLD
It was the first time Grunty Pig had ever been outside his pen And
since he didnt know how long it would be before Farmer Green found him
and took him back home he decided that he had better make the most of
his outing while it lasted
Hurrying into the orchard Grunty ate heartily of the fruit that lay
upon the ground After he had devoured a few dozen apples he began to
lose his appetite for that sort of food So he started to root beneath
the trees It was fun to dig Besides he found a good many tender roots
that tickled his taste They were different from anything he had ever
eaten before
After a while Grunty Pig learned something He had always supposed that
he could go on eating forever if he were only lucky enough to have the
chance But to his surprise he found that there was a limit to the
amount he could consume with comfort He began to have a tight feeling
about his waistband At first he dared hope it would go away But the
more he ate the worse he felt And at last he gave a grunt of
disappointment
I cant eat any more he whined Heres a whole world full of food
just going to waste And I cant even hold one half of it
Still there were other pleasures to be had besides eating Grunty
crawled through the fence into the lane And near the barn where the
cows had trampled he beheld such beautiful sticky deep mud as he had
never dreamed could be found anywhere
Grunty Pig gave a deep sigh of happiness as he wallowed in the mire He
lay on his stomach he turned upon each side He even squirmed through a
puddle and rolled over in it so that there wasnt a clean patch on him
anywhere Little did he care that his silvery bristles were smeared with
black The mud felt delightfully cool upon his piggy pinkish skin
This is almost better than eating Grunty squealed
At last his gurgles and grunts attracted the notice of a proud creature
known as Henrietta Hen She had been scratching for worms in the
farmyard And now she came running around a corner of the barn and
peered through the fence at Grunty
You careless child she squawked Stop playing in that mud Dont you
know that its very dangerous to get your feet wet
Grunty Pig stood up and looked at her
Goodness Youre a sight Henrietta Hen exclaimed Does your mother
know youre here
Now Grunty Pig didnt answer a single one of Henriettas questions He
merely stared at her and said nothing So it was no wonder that she
thought him stupid
Poor Mrs Pig thought Henrietta Hen Its bad enough to have a child
so untidy as this youngster But its far worse to have a dullwitted
one
Then to Grunty she said sharply Youd better get out of that mudhole
and go dry yourself in the sun
He actually obeyed her And as soon as Henrietta Hen saw that he was
sunning himself she walked out of sight around the barn stopping now
and then to pick up some tidbit or other
Good Grunty Pig grunted Shes gone This was the easiest way to get
rid of her
V
SIXES AND SEVENS
Not until feeding time came did anyone discover that Grunty Pig was gone
from the pen It may seem strange that neither his mother nor any of his
brothers and sisters missed him But when there are seven children in a
family it is no wonder that one of them could slip away without having
his absence noticed It is specially easy in such a large family to
overlook the littlest
If Mrs Pig had known there was a loose board on the pen she would
certainly have counted noses to find out whether her children were all
safe at home But nobody knew about that loose board except Grunty
himself
It was lucky that Farmer Green had made the lid for Mrs Pigs
childrens feeding troughthe lid with the seven holes in it When he
poured the childrens supper into the trough and slammed down the lid he
stood and watched Mrs Pigs youngsters as they scrambled to the trough
and stuckeach of thema nose into a hole
All at once Farmer Green noticed something queer Hullo he cried to
his son Johnnie Theres an empty hole here Weve lost a pig
He looked closely at the row of six squirming bunches of squeals
I declare said Farmer Green Its the runt thats gone
Mrs Pig who was enjoying her own supper a little way off did not hear
what Farmer Green said Her children were making a good deal of noise
And to tell the truth Mrs Pig herself wasnt exactly a silent eater
When Farmer Green jumped into the pen and began to poke at the sides of
it she wondered what he was doing Soon he found the loose board and
pushed against it with his foot exclaiming Heres where he got away
Whod have thought that the runt was the smartest of the family
Run and get me a hammer and a few nails said Farmer Green to his son
Johnnie We must fix this pen before any more of the pigs crawl out
Well when she heard the news Mrs Pig nearly choked over a bit of
something or other that she was eating Grunty was gone If she hadnt
spent most of the afternoon dozing perhaps she would have missed him
And poor Mrs Pig began to reproach herself for what wasnt really her
fault at all
I hope youll find him she told Farmer Green as he drove a nail into
the loose board I hope you wont leave my son out tonight Theres no
knowing what might happen to a child of his tender years
Maybe Farmer Green heard her request Anyhow as he handed the hammer to
Johnnie he said Come and help me after you put the hammer back Well
have to find that pig If a bear happened to come down from the mountain
tonight hed treat himself to a feast That runt would make a nice
tender meal
Mrs Pig must certainly have heardand understoodFarmer Greens
remark For she gave a loud squeal of alarm
Hurry she begged him Please Mr Green do find Grunty before
dark
VI
MR CROW HELPS
It was a wonder that Johnnie Green and his father ever found Grunty Pig
Soon after Henrietta Hen left him Grunty crept out of the lane and
wandered into the cornfield He had an idea that Henrietta might go and
tell his mother that she had seen him wallowing in the mud behind the
barn And he did not want to be dragged back to the pigpen
Grunty had no way of knowing that Henrietta Hen forgot all about him
before she had crossed the farmyard She fell into a loud dispute with a
neighbor And she never thought of Grunty again
Grunty Pig enjoyed his ramble into the field of waving corn The corn
was sweet and the dirt was loosejust the finest sort to root in that
a body could possibly want He had the place all to himself until at
last a black gentleman came flying up in a great hurry and ordered him
in a hoarse voice to get out of the cornand be quick about it
On him Grunty Pig tried the same trick that he had used on Henrietta
Hen He looked up with a stupid stare at the newcomer and said never a
word
Old Mr Crowfor it was he that had commanded Grunty to leaveold Mr
Crow abused him roundly Mr Crow was not emptyheaded like Henrietta
Hen He was not to be deceived so easily
Why dont you answer me he bawled You make noise enough when youre
at home Ive heard you often way across the cornfield Mr Crow
cawed so angrily that a dozen of his cronies flew over from the woods to
see what was going on And the whole thirteen made such an uproar that
Farmer Green couldnt help noticing them He and Johnnie were in the
orchard hunting for Grunty Pig
Those crows are up to some mischief Farmer Green declared You dont
supposedo youthat theyre teasing that pig
Well Johnnie Green was willing to go and find out And sure enough he
found Grunty in the cornfield
Johnnie Green picked him up tucked him under his armplastered with
dried mud as he wasand brought him in triumph to the barn
Farmer Green laughed when he saw Grunty Pig
He looks as if he had been enjoying himself he remarked as he
dropped Grunty into the pen with the rest of Mrs Pigs children
Are you going to feed him Johnnie Green inquired
Again his father laughed
No he replied That pig has stuffed himself so full he can scarcely
waddle
As for Mrs Pig she didnt know whether to laugh or to weep She was
glad to have Grunty safe at home again but he was a sad sight
At first Mrs Pig thought Farmer Green had made a mistake She thought
he had found somebody elses child For Grunty was so daubed with black
mud that she actually didnt know him until she heard him grunt Where
have you been she asked him in her sternest voice
Ive been out in the world he answered And Ive had a fine time
Its easy to see said Mrs Pig that youre a born wallower Its a
pity that you havent your brother Blackies complexion The dirt does
show so dreadfully on silver bristles
VII
THE GRUMBLER
All the farmyard folk agreed that Farmer Green took the best of care of
everybody Mrs Pig often told her children that they were lucky to have
so good a home And not having lived anywhere else they never imagined
that anything could be finer than their pen
After the day when he escaped from the pen however Grunty Pig began to
complain He wasnt satisfied with the food that Farmer Green gave him
he grumbled because there was no good place to wallow in mud and
especially did he object because there wasnt a tree to rub against
The orchard he often said is a much pleasanter place than this pen
is There are trees enough in the orchard for every member of our family
to rub againstall at the same time
Somehow when Grunty talked in that fashion every one of Mrs Pigs
children began to crowd against the sides of the pen And even Mrs Pig
herself felt an annoying tickling along her back She did wish that
Grunty wouldnt mention such matters
But nothing Mrs Pig could say seemed to do any good He was always
prattling anyhow She could no more stop his flow of grunts and squeals
than she could have kept the water in the brook from babbling down the
mountainside to Swift River
And even more annoying to Mrs Pig was the way her son Grunty tried to
rub his back against her She said Dont to him so often that she
became heartily sick of the word
What bothered Mrs Pig most of all was Gruntys behavior whenever Farmer
Green came to the pen It was mortifying to her to have her son actually
try to scratch his back against her in the presence of a visitor
I do hope said Mrs Pig to Farmer Green I do hope you dont think
that I havent tried to teach this child better manners And then when
all the rest of her family began to squirm and fidget against the sides
of the pen she added with a sigh Look at them Anyone would suppose
they had had no bringing up at all
Farmer Green smiled as he leaned over the pen and watched the antics of
Grunty Pig and his brothers and sisters
Theres something that I can do for your family to make them happier
he told Mrs Pig Tomorrowif I can spare the timeIll make a
change here A lady whos raising such a fine family as yours deserves
the best there is She ought to have a home with every modern
improvement
There Mrs Pig exclaimed to her children as soon as Farmer Green left
them Did you hear what he said Farmer Green is a kind man I
shouldnt have blamed him if he had put us into the poorest pen on the
place after seeing your unmannerly actions Youll have to behave
betterespecially after we have our new improvements
Well the next day Farmer Green brought a stout post and set it firmly
in the center of Mrs Pigs pen
Thats for you and your family to rub against he informed Mrs Pig
Really he neednt have explained what the improvement was for No
sooner had he climbed out of the pen than Mrs Pig and her children
began to put the rubbing post to good use Grunty was the first of all
to try it And to his mothers delight he stopped grumbling at once
Nor did he ever again disgrace her by scratching his back against her
Instead he always walked up to the rubbing post like a little
gentleman At least that was what Mrs Pig said

FEARFUL NEWS
There came a day at last when Farmer Green gave Mrs Pig and her family
a great treat He let them out of their pen and turned them loose in a
little yard out of doors Such gruntings and squealings hadnt been
heard on the farm for a long time It was just like a picnic And
everybody had the finest of times Still Grunty Pig wasnt content to
stay in the yard with the rest of the family It wasnt long before he
found a hole in the fence big enough to wriggle through And off he
went And he was actually glad for once that he was the littlest of
the family There wasnt another of Mrs Pigs children that could
squeeze through the opening
Grunty Pig trotted the whole length of the lane When he reached the
pasture he found himself face to face with the Muley Cow who acted much
surprised to see him there
Youd better go back home at once she advised him There are bears
on Blue Mountain Sometimes they come down this way Only last week I
had an adventure with one in the back pasture She did not tell Grunty
that she had run away from Cuffy Bear down the hillside A bear said
the Muley Cow would be delighted to meet a tender little pig like
you
Grunty Pig did not even thank the Muley Cow for warning him
Id like to meet a bear he declared stoutly I hope Ill meet one
today
Leaving the Muley Cow he zigzagged up the hill through the pasture
stopping now and then to dig up many a juicy root
Although Mrs Pig missed her runaway son after a time she was not
greatly disturbed
He cant be far off she thought Hell come back before dark And
when Grunty did at last come crawling into the little yard Mrs Pig was
merely vexed with him for having gone off without her consent She was
just about to give him a well deserved scolding But before she could
speak to him Grunty greeted her with a loud squeal
I saw a bear in the pasture he cried
Mrs Pig promptly forgot her displeasure Although her son was certainly
unharmed she couldnt help being startled It gave her what she called
a turn to learn that Grunty had met a bear
A bear Mrs Pig gasped A bear is a terribly dangerous creature
Its a wonder that you ever got home What did you do when you saw
him Mrs Pig demanded
I walked away said Grunty
He couldnt have noticed you Mrs Pig declared If you had squealed
it would have been the end of you
Grunty Pig felt that he was the most important member of the family Not
one of his brothers or sisters had ever seen a bear At least they had
never claimed to have enjoyed so fearsome a sight
It was nothing he boasted Id as soon meet a bear as the Muley
Cow
His mother however was of another mind She kept looking about in an
uneasy fashion
I wish Farmer Green would come and put us into our pen she murmured
It will soon be dark And I shouldnt like to spend the night out
herenot with a bear in the neighborhood
IX
A GREAT ADVENTURE
The next outing that Farmer Green gave Mrs Pigs family in the little
yard proved to be anything but a picnicfor Mrs Pig That poor lady
had a dreadful time Grunty ran away again And he hadnt been gone long
before his mother heard a loud squealing in the nearest field The sound
rapidly grew louder And as she stood still and listened Mrs Pig knew
that it was Gruntys squeal and that he was drawing nearer every moment
Dear me she cried He must be in trouble
Soon Grunty tumbled through the fence And scrambling to his feet he
ran to his mother crying at the top of his voice A bear chased me
Oh Oh shrieked Mrs Pig Its a mercy he didnt catch you Oh Oh
Its lucky youre no fatter else you couldnt have run so fast Being
more than fat herself and greatly excited Mrs Pig had to stop
talking for a time because she gurgled and wheezed and panted in a most
alarming fashion
At last when she had somewhat recovered from her flurry she called to
Grunty And looking at him severely Mrs Pig said to him Let this be a
lesson to you Never never stray away from the farmyard again
Yes Mother was Gruntys glib reply Then he sidled away Somehow he
felt uneasy under his mothers gaze
Perhaps it was a good thing after all that the bear chased him
Mrs Pig muttered Maybe this fright will keep him at home
She soon discovered that it would take more than a mere frightmore
than a commandto stop Grunty from running away For it wasnt long
before she missed him again
If Mrs Pig hadnt been so upset she might have been vexedand with
good reason
Oh that dear little Grunty she wailed The bear may have caught him
already in the cabbage patch
Then piercing squeals fell once more on Mrs Pigs ears
Dear Dear she cried I ought to have watched him I ought to have
kept an eye on Grunty After all hes little more than a baby
Again the squeals grew louder Again Grunty Pig burst through the hole
in the fence and romped up to his mother
He chased me another time he grunted The bear chased me almost as
far as the fence
Sakes alive his mother shrieked Somebody ought to tell Farmer
Green This farm is not a safe place to live with a bear prowling about
it
Do you want me to go and tell Mr Green Grunty inquired
You his mother exclaimed No indeed You stay right here with me
Dont you dare stir out of this yard And to Gruntys astonishment
Mrs Pig bowled him right over to show him that she meant what she
said
He jumped to his feet in a jiffy And he was all ready to slink away
into a corner of the yard but his mother bade him wait
This bear she saidwhat did he look like
X
A QUEER BEAR
Grunty Pigs little eyes fell away from his mothers when she asked him
what the bear looked likethe bear that had chased him
Erhe was whitish with brown spots like Johnnie Greens dog said
Grunty anderhe had a long tail like the old horse Ebenezers and
he had six legs
Mrs Pig suddenly made a most peculiar sound It couldnt be called a
squeal nor a grunt nor a gurgle nor a gasp It was a little like all
four And springing clumsily upon her son Mrs Pig upset him before he
could dodge her
Grunty Pig began to whimper What have I done he whined
Youve deceived me his mother cried You havent seen a bear Youve
