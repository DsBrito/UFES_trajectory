popping the question and requesting of me the loan of the lucky
wifecatchers for the occasion
I need not tell you I was delighted to oblige poor Peter who is the best
fellow and surest shot in the county and accordingly took down the boots
from their peg in the hall Through the negligence of the servant they have
been hung up in a damp state and had become covered with blue mould In
order to render them decent and comfortable for Peter I placed them to dry
inside the fender opposite the fire then lighting my pipe I threw myself
back in my chair and as the fragrant fumes of the Indian weed curled and
wreathed around my head with halfclosed eyes turned upon the renowned
wifecatchers I indulged in delightful visions of future weddings and
christenings and recalled with a sigh the many pleasant ones I had
witnessed in their company
Here my uncle applied the tumbler to his face to conceal his emotion I
brought to mind he continued ordering in a parenthesis another jug of
boiling water I brought to mind the first time I had myself sported the
envied wifecatchers at the pattron of Moycullen I was then as wild a
blade as any in Connaught and the tops were in the prime of their
beauty In fact I am not guilty of flattery or egotism in saying that the
girl who could then turn up her nose at the boots or their master must
have been devilish hard to please But though the heyday of our youth had
passed I consoled myself with the reflection that with the help of the
saints and a pair of new soles we might yet hold out to marry and bury
three generations to come
As these anticipations passed through my mind I was startled by a sudden
rustling near me I raised my eyes to discover the cause and fancy my
surprise when I beheld the wifecatchers by some marvellous power
suddenly become animated gradually elongating and altering themselves
until they assumed the appearance of a couple of tall gentlemen clad in
black with extremely sallow countenances and what was still more
extraordinary though they possessed separate bodies their actions seemed
to be governed by a single mind I stared and doubtless so would you
Jack had you been in my place but my astonishment was at its height when
the partners keeping side by side as closely as the Siamese twins stepped
gracefully over the fender and taking a seat directly opposite me
addressed me in a voice broken by an irrepressible chuckle
Here we are old boy Ugh ugh ugh hoo
So I perceive gentlemen I replied rather drily
You look a little alarmedugh ugh hoo hoo hoo cried the pair
Excuse our laughterhoo hoo hoo We mean no offencenone whatever
Ugh hoo hoo hoo We know we are somewhat changed in appearance
I assured the transformed tops I was delighted in being honoured with
their company under any shape hoped they would make themselves quite at
home and take a glass with me in the friendly way The friends shook their
heads simultaneously declining the offer and he whom I had hitherto known
as the right foot said in a grave voice
We feel obliged sir but we never take anything but water moreover our
business now is to relate to you some of the singular adventures of our
life convinced that in your hand they will be given to the world in three
handsome volumes
My curiosity was instantly awakened and I drew my chair closer to my
communicative friends who stretching out their legs prepared to commence
their recital
Hem cried the right foot who appeared to be the spokesman clearing
his throat and turning to his companionhem which of our adventures
shall I relate first brother
Why replied the left foot after a few moments reflection I dont
think you can do better than tell our friend the story of Terence Duffy and
the heiress
Egad youre right brother that was a droll affair and then
addressing himself to me he continued You remember your Uncle Terence A
funny dog he was and in his young days the very devil for lovemaking and
fighting Look here said the speaker pointing to a small circular
perforation in his side which had been neatly patched This mark which I
shall carry with me to my grave I received in an affair between your uncle
and Captain Donovan of the North Cork Militia The captain one day asserted
in the public library at Ballybreesthawn that a certain Miss Biddy
OBrannigan had hair red as a carrot This calumny was not long in reaching
the ears of your Uncle Terence who prided himself on being the champion of
the sex in general and of Miss Biddy OBrannigan in particular
Accordingly he took the earliest opportunity of demanding from the captain
an apology and a confession that the ladys locks were a beautiful auburn
The militia hero who was too courageous to desert his colours
maintained they were red The result was a meeting on the daisies at four
oclock in the morning when the captains ball grazed your uncles leg
and in return he received a compliment from Terence in the hip that
spoiled his dancing for life
I will not insult your penetration by telling you what I perceive you are
already aware of that Terence Duffy was the professed admirer of Miss
Biddy The affair with Captain Donovan raised him materially in her
estimation and it was whispered that the hand and fortune of the heiress
were destined for her successful champion Theres an old saying though
that the best dog dont always catch the hare as Terence found to his
cost He had a rival candidate for the affections of Miss Biddy but such a
rivalhowever I will not anticipate
SONGS FOR THE SENTIMENTAL NO 3
I am thine in my gladness
Im thine in thy tears
My love it can change not

Were a dungeon thy dwelling
My home it should be
For its gloom would be sunshine
If I were with thee
But the light has no beauty
Of thee love bereft
I am thine and thine only
Thineover the left
Over the left
As the wild Arab hails
On his desolate way
The palmtree which tells
Where the cool fountains play
So thy presence is ever
The herald of bliss
For theres love in thy smile
And theres joy in thy kiss
Thou hast won methen wear me
Of thee love bereft
I should fade like a flower

WIT WITHOUT MONEY
OR HOW TO LIVE UPON NOTHING
BY VAMPYRE HORSELEECH ESQ
Creations heirthe world the world is mineGOLDSMITH
Philosophers moralists poets in all ages have never better pleased
themselves or satisfied their readers than when they have descanted upon
deplored and denounced the pernicious influence of money upon the heart
and the understanding Filthy lucreso much trash as may be grasped
thusyellow mischief I know not or choose not to recount how many
justly injurious names have been applied to coin by those who knew because
they had felt its consequences Wherefore I say at once it is better to
have none ontto live without it And yet now I think better upon that
point it is well not altogether to discourage its approach On the
contrary lay hold upon it seize it rescue it from hands which in all
probability would work ruin with it and resolutely refuse when it is once
got to let it go out of your grasp Let no absurd talk about quittance
discharge remuneration payment induce the holder to relax from his
inflexible purpose of palm Pay like party is the madness of many for the
gain of a few
Unhappily vile gold or its representation or equivalent has been during
many centuries the sole medium through which the majority of mankind have
supplied their wants or ministered to their luxuries It is high time that
a sage should arise to expound how the discerning fewthose who have the
wit and the will both must concur to the great end may liveLIVEnot
like him who buys and balances himself by the book of the groveller who
wrote How to Live upon Fifty Pounds a YearO shame to manhoodbut
live I saybe free and merrylaugh and grow fatexchange the
courtesies of lifebe a pattern of the minor moralsand yet all this
without a doit in bank bureau or breeches pocket
I am that sage Let none deride Haply I shall only remind some but I may
teach many Those that come to scoff may perchance go home to prey
Let no gentleman of the old school for whom indeed my brief treatise is
not designed be startled when I advance this proposition That more
discreditable methods are daily practised by those who live to get money
than are resorted to by those who without money are nevertheless under the
necessity of living If this proposition be assented toas in truth I
know not how it can be gainsaidnothing need be urged in vindication of
my art of free living Proceed I then at once
Here is a youth of promiseborn like Jaffier with elegant desiresone
who does not agnize a prompt alacrity in carrying burdensone rather who
recognizes a moral and physical unfitness for such and indeed all other
dorsal and manual operationsone who has been born a Briton and would
not therefore sell his birthright for a mess of pottage but on the
contrary holds that his birthright entitles him to as many messes of
pottage as there may be days to his mortal span though times fingers
stretched beyond the distance allotted to extreme Parr or extremest

peripatetics I was accosted with brutally openmouthed clamour by my
landlady who dragging me in a state of bewilderment into her room
pointed to numerous specimens of granite which her young people had in
their unhallowed thirst for knowledge discovered and drawn from my trunk
which by some strange mischance had been left unlocked In vain I mumbled
something touching my love of mineralogy and that a lapidary had offered I
knew not what for my collection I was compelled to bundle as the
idiomatic but ignorant woman expressed herself To resume

Ferguson I knew well and I respected him But he had a most unfortunate
countenance It was a very solemn but by no means a solvent face and yet
he had a manner with him too and his language was choice if not

OUR CITY ARTICLE
We have no arrivals today but are looking out anxiously for the overland
mail from Battersea It is expected that news will be brought of the state
of the mushroom market and great inconvenience in the mean time is felt by
the dealers who are holding all they have got in the anticipation of a
fall while commodities are of course every moment getting heavier
The London and Westminster steamboat Tulip with letters from Milbank
was planted in the mud off Westminster for several hours and those who
looked for the correspondence had to look much longer than could have been
agreeable
The egg market has been in a very unsettled state all the week and we have
heard whispers of a large breakage in one of the wholesale houses This is
caused by the dead weight of the packingcases to which every house in the
trade is liable In the fruit market there is positively nothing doing
and the growers who are every day becoming less complain bitterly
Raspberries were very slack at 212d per pottle but dry goods still
brought their prices We have heard of several severe smashes in currants
and the bakers who it is said generally contrive to get a finger in the
pie are among the sufferers
The salmon trade is for the most part in a pickle but we should regret
to say anything that might be misinterpreted The periwinkle and wilk
interest has sustained a severe shock but potatoes continue to be done
much as usual

THE SKELETON OF HONOURED WORTH IN THEE
SUPREME COURT OF THE LORD HIGH INQUISITOR PUNCH
Laselato ogni speranza voi ch intrate
JOHN BULL v THE PEEL PLACEHUNTING COMPANY
MR JOBTICKLER said he had to move in this cause for an injunction to
restrain the Peel Placehunting Company from entering into possession of
the estates of plaintiff It appeared from the affidavits on which he
moved that the defendants though not in actual possession laid an
equitable claim to the fee simple of the large estates rightfully belonging
to the plaintiff over which they were about to exercise sovereign
dominion They had entered into private treaty with the blind old man who
held the post of chief lawgrubber of the Exchequer offering him a bribe
to pretend illness and take half his present pay in order to fasten one
of the young and longlived leechesone Sir Frederick Smalluckto the
vacant bench They were about to compel a decentish sort of man who did
the business of Chancery as well as such business can be done under the
present system to retire upon half allowance in order to make room for
one Sir William Fullhat who had no objection to 14000 a year and a
peerage They were about to fill two subchancellorships which they would
not on any account allow the company in the present actual possession of
the estates to fill up with a couple of their own shareholders and were
in fine proceeding to dispose of by open sale and by private contract
the freehold leasehold and funded property of plaintiff to the
incalculable danger of the estate and to the disregard of decency and
justice What rendered this assumption and exercise of power the more
intolerable was that the persons the most unfit were selected and as if
it would appear from a hateful love of contraries the man learned in
law being sent to preside over the business of equity of which he knew
nothing and the man learned in equity being entrusted with the direction
of law of which he knew worse than nothing being obliged to unlearn all he
had previously learnt before he began to learn his new craft
