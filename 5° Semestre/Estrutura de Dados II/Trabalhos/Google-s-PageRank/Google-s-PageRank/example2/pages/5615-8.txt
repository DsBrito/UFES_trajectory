Once upon a time there lived a cat of marvellous beauty with a skin as
soft and shining as silk and wise green eyes that could see even in
the dark His name was Gon and he belonged to a music teacher who
was so fond and proud of him that he would not have parted with him for
anything in the world
Now not far from the music masters house there dwelt a lady who
possessed a most lovely little pussy cat called Koma She was such a
little dear altogether and blinked her eyes so daintily and ate her
supper so tidily and when she had finished she licked her pink nose so
delicately with her little tongue that her mistress was never tired of
saying Koma Koma what should I do without you
Well it happened one day that these two when out for an evening
stroll met under a cherry tree and in one moment fell madly in love
with each other Gon had long felt that it was time for him to find a
wife for all the ladies in the neighbourhood paid him so much attention
that it made him quite shy but he was not easy to please and did not
care about any of them Now before he had time to think Cupid had
entangled him in his net and he was filled with love towards Koma She
fully returned his passion but like a woman she saw the difficulties
in the way and consulted sadly with Gon as to the means of overcoming
them Gon entreated his master to set matters right by buying Koma but
her mistress would not part from her Then the music master was asked to
sell Gon to the lady but he declined to listen to any such suggestion
so everything remained as before
At length the love of the couple grew to such a pitch that they
determined to please themselves and to seek their fortunes together
So one moonlight night they stole away and ventured out into an unknown
world All day long they marched bravely on through the sunshine till
they had left their homes far behind them and towards evening they
found themselves in a large park The wanderers by this time were very
hot and tired and the grass looked very soft and inviting and the
trees cast cool deep shadows when suddenly an ogre appeared in this
Paradise in the shape of a big big dog He came springing towards them
showing all his teeth and Koma shrieked and rushed up a cherry tree
Gon however stood his ground boldly and prepared to give battle for
he felt that Komas eyes were upon him and that he must not run away
But alas his courage would have availed him nothing had his enemy once
touched him for he was large and powerful and very fierce From her
perch in the tree Koma saw it all and screamed with all her might
hoping that some one would hear and come to help Luckily a servant of
the princess to whom the park belonged was walking by and he drove off
the dog and picking up the trembling Gon in his arms carried him to
his mistress
So poor little Koma was left alone while Gon was borne away full of
trouble not in the least knowing what to do Even the attention paid
him by the princess who was delighted with his beauty and pretty ways
did not console him but there was no use in fighting against fate and
he could only wait and see what would turn up
The princess Gons new mistress was so good and kind that everybody
loved her and she would have led a happy life had it not been for a
serpent who had fallen in love with her and was constantly annoying her
by his presence Her servants had orders to drive him away as often as
he appeared but as they were careless and the serpent very sly it
sometimes happened that he was able to slip past them and to frighten
the princess by appearing before her One day she was seated in her
room playing on her favourite musical instrument when she felt
something gliding up her sash and saw her enemy making his way to kiss
her cheek She shrieked and threw herself backwards and Gon who had
been curled up on a stool at her feet understood her terror and with
one bound seized the snake by his neck He gave him one bite and one
shake and flung him on the ground where he lay never to worry the
princess any more Then she took Gon in her arms and praised and
caressed him and saw that he had the nicest bits to eat and the
softest mats to lie on and he would have had nothing in the world to
wish for if only he could have seen Koma again
Time passed on and one morning Gon lay before the house door basking
in the sun He looked lazily at the world stretched out before him
and saw in the distance a big ruffian of a cat teasing and illtreating
quite a little one He jumped up full of rage and chased away the big
cat and then he turned to comfort the little one when his heart nearly
burst with joy to find that it was Koma At first Koma did not know him
again he had grown so large and stately but when it dawned upon her
who it was her happiness knew no bounds And they rubbed their heads
and their noses again and again while their purring might have been
heard a mile off
Paw in paw they appeared before the princess and told her the story of
their life and its sorrows The princess wept for sympathy and promised
that they should never more be parted but should live with her to the
end of their days Byandbye the princess herself got married and
brought a prince to dwell in the palace in the park And she told him
all about her two cats and how brave Gon had been and how he had
delivered her from her enemy the serpent
And when the prince heard he swore they should never leave them but
should go with the princess wherever she went So it all fell out as
the princess wished and Gon and Koma had many children and so had the
princess and they all played together and were friends to the end of
their lives
How the Dragon Was Tricked
From Griechtsche und Albanesische Marchen von J G von Hahn Leipzig
Engelmann 1864
Once upon a time there lived a man who had two sons but they did not
get on at all well together for the younger was much handsomer than his
elder brother who was very jealous of him When they grew older things
became worse and worse and at last one day as they were walking through
a wood the elder youth seized hold of the other tied him to a tree and
went on his way hoping that the boy might starve to death
However it happened that an old and humpbacked shepherd passed the tree
with his flock and seeing the prisoner he stopped and said to him
Tell me my son why are you tied to that tree
Because I was so crooked answered the young man but it has quite
cured me and now my back is as straight as can be
I wish you would bind me to a tree exclaimed the shepherd so that
my back would get straight
With all the pleasure in life replied the youth If you will loosen
these cords I will tie you up with them as firmly as I can
This was soon done and then the young man drove off the sheep leaving
their real shepherd to repent of his folly and before he had gone very
far he met with a horse boy and a driver of oxen and he persuaded them
to turn with him and to seek for adventures
By these and many other tricks he soon became so celebrated that his
fame reached the kings ears and his majesty was filled with curiosity
to see the man who had managed to outwit everybody So he commanded his
guards to capture the young man and bring him before him
And when the young man stood before the king the king spoke to him
and said By your tricks and the pranks that you have played on other
people you have in the eye of the law forfeited your life But on one
condition I will spare you and that is if you will bring me the flying
horse that belongs to the great dragon Fail in this and you shall be
hewn in a thousand pieces
If that is all said the youth you shall soon have it
So he went out and made his way straight to the stable where the flying
horse was tethered He stretched his hand cautiously out to seize the
bridle when the horse suddenly began to neigh as loud as he could Now
the room in which the dragon slept was just above the stable and at
the sound of the neighing he woke and cried to the horse What is the
matter my treasure is anything hurting you After waiting a little
while the young man tried again to loose the horse but a second time it
neighed so loudly that the dragon woke up in a hurry and called out
to know why the horse was making such a noise But when the same thing
happened the third time the dragon lost his temper and went down
into the stable and took a whip and gave the horse a good beating This
offended the horse and made him angry and when the young man stretched
out his hand to untie his head he made no further fuss but suffered
himself to be led quietly away Once clear of the stable the young man
sprang on his back and galloped off calling over his shoulder Hi
dragon dragon if anyone asks you what has become of your horse you
can say that I have got him
But the king said The flying horse is all very well but I want
something more You must bring me the covering with the little bells
that lies on the bed of the dragon or I will have you hewn into a
thousand pieces
Is that all answered the youth That is easily done
And when night came he went away to the dragons house and climbed up on
to the roof Then he opened a little window in the roof and let down
the chain from which the kettle usually hung and tried to hook the bed
covering and to draw it up But the little bells all began to ring and
the dragon woke and said to his wife Wife you have pulled off all the
bedclothes and drew the covering towards him pulling as he did so
the young man into the room Then the dragon flung himself on the
youth and bound him fast with cords saying as he tied the last knot
Tomorrow when I go to church you must stay at home and kill him and
cook him and when I get back we will eat him together
So the following morning the dragoness took hold of the young man and
reached down from the shelf a sharp knife with which to kill him But as
she untied the cords the better to get hold of him the prisoner caught
her by the legs threw her to the ground seized her and speedily cut
her throat just as she had been about to do for him and put her body
in the oven Then he snatched up the covering and carried it to the
king
The king was seated on his throne when the youth appeared before him and
spread out the covering with a deep bow That is not enough said his
majesty you must bring me the dragon himself or I will have you hewn
into a thousand pieces
It shall be done answered the youth but you must give me two years
to manage it for my beard must grow so that he may not know me
So be it said the king
And the first thing the young man did when his beard was grown was to
take the road to the dragons house and on the way he met a beggar whom
he persuaded to change clothes with him and in the beggars garments he
went fearlessly forth to the dragon
He found his enemy before his house very busy making a box and
addressed him politely Good morning your worship Have you a morsel
of bread
You must wait replied the dragon till I have finished my box and
then I will see if I can find one
What will you do with the box when it is made inquired the beggar
It is for the young man who killed my wife and stole my flying horse
and my bed covering said the dragon
He deserves nothing better answered the beggar for it was an ill
deed Still that box is too small for him for he is a big man
You are wrong said the dragon The box is large enough even for me
Well the rogue is nearly as tall as you replied the beggar and
of course if you can get in he can But I am sure you would find it a
tight fit
No there is plenty of room said the dragon tucking himself
carefully inside
But no sooner was he well in than the young man clapped on the lid and
called out Now press hard just to see if he will be able to get out
The dragon pressed as hard as he could but the lid never moved
It is all right he cried now you can open it
But instead of opening it the young man drove in long nails to make it
tighter still then he took the box on his back and brought it to the
king And when the king heard that the dragon was inside he was so
excited that he would not wait one moment but broke the lock and lifted
the lid just a little way to make sure he was really there He was
very careful not to leave enough space for the dragon to jump out but
unluckily there was just room for his great mouth and with one snap
the king vanished down his wide red jaws Then the young man married the
kings daughter and ruled over the land but what he did with the dragon
nobody knows
The Goblin and the Grocer
Translated from the German of Hans Andersen
There was once a hardworking student who lived in an attic and he had
nothing in the world of his own There was also a hardworking grocer
who lived on the first floor and he had the whole house for his own
The Goblin belonged to him for every Christmas Eve there was waiting
for him at the grocers a dish of jam with a large lump of butter in the
middle
The grocer could afford this so the Goblin stayed in the grocers shop
and this teaches us a good deal One evening the student came in by the
back door to buy a candle and some cheese he had no one to send so he
came himself
He got what he wanted paid for it and nodded a good evening to the
grocer and his wife she was a woman who could do more than nod she
could talk
When the student had said good night he suddenly stood still reading
the sheet of paper in which the cheese had been wrapped
It was a leaf torn out of an old booka book of poetry
Theres more of that over there said the grocer I gave an old woman
some coffee for the book If you like to give me twopence you can have
the rest
Yes said the student give me the book instead of the cheese I can
eat my bread without cheese It would be a shame to leave the book to
be torn up You are a clever and practical man but about poetry you
understand as much as that old tub over there
And that sounded rude as far as the tub was concerned but the grocer
laughed and so did the student It was only said in fun
But the Goblin was angry that anyone should dare to say such a thing to
a grocer who owned the house and sold the best butter
When it was night and the shop was shut and everyone was in bed except
the student the Goblin went upstairs and took the grocers wifes
tongue She did not use it when she was asleep and on whatever object
in the room he put it that thing began to speak and spoke out its
thoughts and feelings just as well as the lady to whom it belonged But
only one thing at a time could use it and that was a good thing or
they would have all spoken together
The Goblin laid the tongue on the tub in which were the old newspapers
Is it true he asked  that you know nothing about poetry
Certainly not answered the tub Poetry is something that is in the
papers and that is frequently cut out I have a great deal more in
me than the student has and yet I am only a small tub in the grocers
shop
And the Goblin put the tongue on the coffeemill and how it began to
grind He put it on the buttercask and on the till and all were
of the same opinion as the wastepaper tub and one must believe the
majority
Now I will tell the student and with these words he crept softly up
the stairs to the attic where the student lived
There was a light burning and the Goblin peeped through the keyhole
and saw that he was reading the torn book that he had bought in the
shop
But how bright it was Out of the book shot a streak of light which grew
into a large tree and spread its branches far above the student Every
leaf was alive and every flower was a beautiful girls head some with
dark and shining eyes others with wonderful blue ones Every fruit was
a glittering star and there was a marvellous music in the students
room The little Goblin had never even dreamt of such a splendid sight
much less seen it
He stood on tiptoe gazing and gazing till the candle in the attic
was put out the student had blown it out and had gone to bed but the
Goblin remained standing outside listening to the music which very
softly and sweetly was now singing the student a lullaby
I have never seen anything like this said the Goblin I never
expected this I must stay with the student
The little fellow thought it over for he was a sensible Goblin Then he
sighed The student has no jam
And on that he went down to the grocer again And it was a good thing
that he did go back for the tub had nearly worn out the tongue It had
read everything that was inside it on the one side and was just going
to turn itself round and read from the other side when the Goblin came
in and returned the tongue to its owner
But the whole shop from the till down to the shavings from that night
changed their opinion of the tub and they looked up to it and had such
faith in it that they were under the impression that when the grocer
read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings it
all came from the tub
But the Goblin could no longer sit quietly listening to the wisdom and
intellect downstairs No as soon as the light shone in the evening
from the attic it seemed to him as though its beams were strong ropes
dragging him up and he had to go and peep through the keyhole There
he felt the sort of feeling we have looking at the great rolling sea in
a storm and he burst into tears He could not himself say why he wept
but in spite of his tears he felt quite happy How beautiful it must be
to sit under that tree with the student but that he could not do he
had to content himself with the keyhole and be happy there
There he stood out on the cold landing the autumn wind blowing through
the cracks of the floor It was coldvery cold but he first found it
out when the light in the attic was put out and the music in the wood
died away Ah then it froze him and he crept down again into his warm
corner there it was comfortable and cosy
When Christmas came and with it the jam with the large lump of butter
ah then the grocer was first with him
But in the middle of the night the Goblin awoke hearing a great noise
and knocking against the shutterspeople hammering from outside The
watchman was blowing his horn a great fire had broken out the whole
town was in flames
Was it in the house or was it at a neighbours Where was it
The alarm increased The grocers wife was so terrified that she took
her gold earrings out of her ears and put them in her pocket in order
to save something The grocer seized his account books and the maid her
black silk dress
Everyone wanted to save his most valuable possession so did the Goblin
and in a few leaps he was up the stairs and in the students room He
was standing quietly by the open window looking at the fire that was
burning in the neighbours house just opposite The Goblin seized the
book lying on the table put it in his red cap and clasped it with both
hands The best treasure in the house was saved and he climbed out on
to the roof with iton to the chimney There he sat lighted up by the
flames from the burning house opposite both hands holding tightly on
his red cap in which lay the treasure and now he knew what his heart
really valued mostto whom he really belonged But when the fire was
put out and the Goblin thought it overthen
I will divide myself between the two he said I cannot quite give up
the grocer because of the jam
And it is just the same with us We also cannot quite give up the
grocerbecause of the jam
The House in the Wood
From the German of Grimm
A poor woodcutter lived with his wife and three daughters in a little
hut on the borders of a great forest
One morning as he was going to his work he said to his wife Let our
eldest daughter bring me my lunch into the wood and so that she shall
not lose her way I will take a bag of millet with me and sprinkle the
seed on the path
When the sun had risen high over the forest the girl set out with a
basin of soup But the field and wood sparrows the larks and finches
blackbirds and green finches had picked up the millet long ago and the
girl could not find her way
She went on and on till the sun set and night came on The trees
rustled in the darkness the owls hooted and she began to be very much
frightened Then she saw in tile distance a light that twinkled between
the trees There must be people living yonder she thought who will
take me in for the night and she began walking towards it
Not long afterwards she came to a house with lights in the windows
She knocked at the door and a gruff voice called Come in
The girl stepped into the dark entrance and tapped at the door of the
room
Just walk in cried the voice and when she opened the door there sat
an old grayhaired man at the table His face was resting on his hands
and his white beard flowed over the table almost down to the ground
By the stove lay three beasts a hen a cock and a brindled cow The
girl told the old man her story and asked for a nights lodging
The man said
Pretty cock
Pretty hen
And you pretty brindled cow
What do you say now
Duks answered the beasts and that must have meant We are quite
willing for the old man went on Here is abundance go into the back
kitchen and cook us a supper
The girl found plenty of everything in the kitchen and cooked a good
meal but she did not think of the beasts
She placed the full dishes on the table sat down opposite the
grayhaired man and ate till her hunger was appeased
When she was satisfied she said But now I am so tired where is a bed
in which I can sleep
The beasts answered
You have eaten with him
You have drunk with him
Of us you have not thought
Sleep then as you ought
Then the old man said Go upstairs and there you will find a bedroom
shake the bed and put clean sheets on and go to sleep
The maiden went upstairs and when she had made the bed she lay down
After some time the grayhaired man came looked at her by the light
of his candle and shook his head And when he saw that she was sound
asleep he opened a trapdoor and let her fall into the cellar
The woodcutter came home late in the evening and reproached his wife
for leaving him all day without food
No I did not she answered the girl went off with your dinner She
must have lost her way but will no doubt come back tomorrow
But at daybreak the woodcutter started off into the wood and this time
asked his second daughter to bring his food
I will take a bag of lentils said he they are larger than millet
and the girl will see them better and be sure to find her way
At midday the maiden took the food but the lentils had all gone as on
the previous day the wood birds had eaten them all
The maiden wandered about the wood till nightfall when she came in
the same way to the old mans house and asked for food and a nights
lodging
The man with the white hair again asked the beasts
Pretty cock
Pretty hen
And you pretty brindled cow
What do you say now
The beasts answered Duks and everything happened as on the former
day
The girl cooked a good meal ate and drank with the old man and did not
trouble herself about the animals
And when she asked for a bed they replied
You have eaten with him
You have drunk with him
Of us you have not thought
Now sleep as you ought
And when she was asleep the old man shook his head over her and let
her fall into the cellar
On the third morning the woodcutter said to his wife Send our youngest
child today with my dinner She is always good and obedient and will
keep to the right path and not wander away like her sisters idle
drones
But the mother said Must I lose my dearest child too
Do not fear he answered she is too clever and intelligent to lose
her way I will take plenty of peas with me and strew them along they
are even larger than lentils and will show her the way
But when the maiden started off with the basket on her arm the wood
pigeons had eaten up the peas and she did not know which way to go She
was much distressed and thought constantly of her poor hungry father
and her anxious mother At last when it grew dark she saw the little
light and came to the house in the wood She asked prettily if she
might stay there for the night and the man with the white beard asked
his beasts again
Pretty cock
Pretty hen
And you pretty brindled cow
What do you say now
Duks they said Then the maiden stepped up to the stove where the
animals were lying and stroked the cock and the hen and scratched the
brindled cow between its horns
And when at the bidding of the old man she had prepared a good supper
and the dishes were standing on the table she said Shall I have
plenty while the good beasts have nothing There is food to spare
outside I will attend to them first
Then she went out and fetched barley and strewed it before the cock and
hen and brought the cow an armful of sweetsmelling hay
Eat that dear beasts she said and when you are thirsty you shall
have a good drink
Then she fetched a bowl of water and the cock and hen flew on to the
edge put their beaks in and then held up their heads as birds do when
they drink and the brindled cow also drank her fill When the beasts
were satisfied the maiden sat down beside the old man at the table and
ate what was left for her Soon the cock and hen began to tuck their
heads under their wings and the brindled cow blinked its eyes so the
maiden said Shall we not go to rest now
Pretty cock
Pretty hen
And you pretty brindled cow
What do you say now
The animals said Duks
You have eaten with us
You have drunk with us
You have tended us right
So we wish you good night
The maiden therefore went upstairs made the bed and put on clean sheets
and fell asleep She slept peacefully till midnight when there was such
a noise in the house that she awoke Everything trembled and shook the
animals sprang up and dashed themselves in terror against the wall the
beams swayed as if they would be torn from their foundations it seemed
as if the stairs were tumbling down and then the roof fell in with a
crash Then all became still and as no harm came to the maiden she lay
down again and fell asleep But when she awoke again in broad daylight
what a sight met her eyes She was lying in a splendid room furnished
with royal splendour the walls were covered with golden flowers on a
green ground the bed was of ivory and the counterpane of velvet and on
a stool near by lay a pair of slippers studded with pearls The maiden
thought she must be dreaming but in came three servants richly dressed
who asked what were her commands Go said the maiden I will get up
at once and cook the old mans supper for him and then I will feed the
pretty cock and hen and the brindled cow
But the door opened and in came a handsome young man who said I am a
kings son and was condemned by a wicked witch to live as an old man
in this wood with no company but that of my three servants who were
transformed into a cock a hen and a brindled cow The spell could only
be broken by the arrival of a maiden who should show herself kind
not only to men but to beasts You are that maiden and last night at
midnight we were freed and this poor house was again transformed into
my royal palace
As they stood there the kings son told his three servants to go and
fetch the maidens parents to be present at the wedding feast
But where are my two sisters asked the maid
I shut them up in the cellar but in the morning they shall be led
