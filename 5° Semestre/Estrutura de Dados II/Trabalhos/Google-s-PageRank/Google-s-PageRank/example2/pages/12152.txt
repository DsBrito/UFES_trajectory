I surprised her he ses looking very fierce  I went to er box and
I found a pile of ema pile of emtied up with a piece o pink ribbon
And a photygraph of my lord  And of all the narrerchested weakeyed
slackbaked spindlylegged sons of a gun you ever saw in your life he
is the worst  If I ony get my ands on him Ill choke im with his own
feet
He washed is mouth out with a drop o beer and stood scowling at the
floor
Arter Ive choked im Ill twist his neck he ses  If he ad ony
put his address on is letters Id go round and do it now  And my
daughter my only daughter wont tell me where he lives
She ought to know better I ses
He took hold o my and and shook it  Youve got more sense than one
ud think to look at you Bill he ses not thinking wot he was saying
You see wot a mess Im in
Yes I ses
Im a nurse thats wot I am he ses very savage  Just a
nursemaid I cant move and or foot without that gal  Owd you like
it yourself Bill
It must be very orkard for you I ses  Very orkard indeed
Orkard  he ses its no name for it Bill  I might as well be a
Sundayschool teacher and ha done with it  I never ad such a dull
time in all my life  Never  And the worst of it is its spiling my
temper  And all because o that narrereyed redchestedyou know wot
I mean
He took another mouthful o beer and then he took old of my arm
Bill he ses very earnest I want you to do me a favour
Go ahead I ses
Ive got to meet a pal at Charing Cross at hapast seven he ses
and were going to make a night of it  Ive left Winnie in charge o
the cook and Ive told im plain that if she aint there when I come
back Ill skin im alive  Now I want you to watch er too  Keep the
gate locked and dont let anybody in you dont know  Especially that
monkeyfaced imitation of a man  Here e is  Thats his likeness
He pulled a photygraph out of is coatpocket and anded it to me
Thats im he ses  Fancy a gal getting loveletters from a thing
like that  And she was ony twenty last birthday  Keep your eye on
er Bill and dont let er out of your sight  Youre worth two o the
cook
He finished is beer and cuddling my arm stepped back to the wharf
Miss Butt was sitting on the cabin skylight reading a book and old Joe
the cook was standing near er pretending to swab the decks with a mop
Ive got to go out for a little whileon business ses the skipper
I dont spose I shall be long and while Im away Bill and the cook
will look arter you
Miss Butt wrinkled up er shoulders
The gatell be locked and youre not to leave the wharf  Dye ear
The gal wriggled er shoulders agin and went on reading but she gave
the cook a look out of er innercent baby eyes that nearly made im drop
the mop
Thems my orders ses the skipper swelling his chest and looking
round to everybody  You know wotll appen to you Joe if things
aint right when I come back  Come along Bill and lock the gate arter
me  An mind for your own sake dont let anything appen to that gal
while Im away
Wot timell you be back I ses as e stepped through the wicket
Not afore twelve and praps a good bit later he ses smiling all
over with appiness  But young slabchest dont know Im out and
Winnie thinks Im just going out for arf an hour so itll be all
right So long
I watched im up the road and I must say I began to wish I adnt
taken the job on  Arter all I ad ony had two pints and a bit o
flattery and I knew wot ud appen if anything went wrong  Built like
a bull he was and fond o using his strength  I locked the wicket
careful and putting the key in my pocket began to walk up and down
the wharf
For about ten minutes the gal went on reading and didnt look up once
Then as I passed she gave me a nice smile and shook er little fist at
the cook wot ad got is back towards er  I smiled back o course
and by and by she put her book down and climbed on to the side o the
ship and held out her and for me to elp her ashore
Im so tired of the ship she ses in a soft voice its like a
prison  Dont you get tired of the wharf
Sometimes I ses but its my dooty
Yes she ses  Yes of course  But youre a big strong man and
you can put up with things better
She gave a little sigh and we walked up and down for a time without
saying anything
And its all fathers foolishness she ses at last thats wot
makes it so tiresome  I cant help a pack of silly young men writing to
me can I
No I spose not I ses
Thank you she ses putting er little and on my arm  I knew that
you were sensible  Ive often watched you when Ive been sitting alone
on the schooner longing for somebody to speak to  And Im a good judge
of character  I can read you like a book
She turned and looked up at me  Beautiful blue eyes shed got with
long curling lashes and teeth like pearls
Father is so silly she ses shaking her ead and looking down and
its so unreasonable because as a matter of fact I dont like young
men  Oh I beg your pardon I didnt mean that  I didnt mean to be
rude
Rude I ses staring at her
Of course it was a rude thing for me to say she ses smiling
because you are still a young man yourself
I shook my ead  Youngish I ses
Young she ses stamping er little foot
She gave me another look and this time er blue eyes seemed large and
solemn  She walked along like one in a dream and twice she tripped
over the planks and would ave fallen if I hadnt caught er round the
waist
Thank you she ses  Im very clumsy  How strong your arm is
We walked up and down agin and every time we went near the edge of the
jetty she eld on to my arm for fear of stumbling agin  And there was
that silly cook standing about on the schooner on tiptoe and twisting
his silly old neck till I wonder it didnt twist off
Wot a beautiful evening it is she ses at last in a low voice  I
ope father isnt coming back early  Do you know wot time he is coming
home
About twelve I ses but dont tell im I told you so
O course not she ses squeezing my arm  Poor father I hope he is
enjoying himself as much as I am
We walked down to the jetty agin arter that and sat side by side
looking acrost the river  And she began to talk about Life and wot a
strange thing it was and ow the river would go on flowing down to the
sea thousands and thousands o years arter we was both dead and
forgotten  If it hadnt ha been for her little ead leaning agin my
shoulder I should have ad the creeps
Lets go down into the cabin she ses at last with a little shiver
it makes me melancholy sitting here and thinking of the mighthave
beens
I got up first and elped her up and arter both staring hard at the
cook wot didnt seem to know is place we went down into the cabin
It was a comfortable little place and arter she ad poured me out a
glass of er fathers whisky and filled my pipe for me I wouldnt ha
changed places with a king  Even when the pipe wouldnt draw I didnt
mind
May I write a letter she ses at last
Sartainly I ses
She got out her pen and ink and paper and wrote  I shant be long
she ses looking up and nibbling er pen  Its a letter to my
dressmaker she promised my dress by six oclock this afternoon and I
am just writing to tell her that if I dont have it by ten in the
morning she can keep it
Quite right I ses its the ony way to get things done
Its my way she ses sticking the letter in an envelope and licking
it down  Nice name isnt it
She passed it over to me and I read the name and address Miss Minnie
Miller 17 John Street Mile End Road
Thatll wake her up She ses smiling  Will you ask Joe to take it
for me
Hehes on guard I ses smiling back at er and shaking my ead
I know she ses in a low voice  But I dont want any guardonly
you  I dont like guards that peep down skylights
I looked up just in time to see Joes ead disappear  Then I nipped
up and arter I ad told im part of wot I thought about im I gave im
the letter and told im to sheer off
The skipper told me to stay ere he ses looking obstinate
You do as youre told I ses  Im in charge and I take full
responsibility  I shall lock the gate arter you  Wot are you worrying
about
And heres a shilling Joe for a bus fare ses the gal smiling
You can keep the change
Joe took off is cap and scratched is silly bald ead
Come on I ses its a letter to a dressmaker  A letter that must
go tonight
Else its no use ses the gal  You dont know ow important it is
All right ses Joe  Ave it your own way  So long as you dont
tell the skipper I dont mind  If anything appens youll catch it too
Bill
He climbed ashore and I follered im to the gate and unlocked it  He
was screwing up is eye ready for a wink but I give im such a look
that he thought better of it and arter rubbing his eye with is finger
as though he ad got a bit o dust in it he went off
I locked the gate and went back to the cabin and for some time we sat
talking about fathers and the foolish ideas they got into their eads
and things o that sort  So far as I remember I ad two more goes o
whisky and one o the skippers cigars and I was just thinking wot a
beautiful thing it was to be alive and ealthy and in good spirits
talking to a nice gal that understood wot you said amost afore you said
it when I eard three blows on a whistle
Wots that I ses starting up  Police whistle
I dont think so ses Miss Butt putting her and on my shoulder
Sit down and stay where you are  I dont want you to get hurt if it
is  Let somebody I dont like go
I sat down agin and listened but there was no more whistling
Boy in the street I expect ses the gal going into the stateroom
Oh Ive got something to show you  Wait a minute
I eard her moving about and then she comes back into the cabin
I cant find the key of my box she ses and its in there  I
wonder whether youve got a key that would open it  Its a padlock
I put my and in my pocket and pulled out my keys  Shall I come and
try I ses
No thank you she ses taking the keys  This looks about the size
What key is it
Its the key of the gate I ses but I dont suppose itll fit
She went back into the stateroom agin and I eard her fumbling at a
lock  Then she came back into the cabin breathing rather hard and
stood thinking
Ive just remembered she ses pinching her chin  Yes
She stepped to the door and went up the companionladder and the next
moment I eard a sliding noise and a key turn in a lock  I jumped to
the foot of the ladder and ardly able to believe my senses saw that
the hatch was closed  When I found that it was locked too you might
ha knocked me down with a feather
I went down to the cabin agin and standing on the locker pushed the
skylight up with my ead and tried to lookout  I couldnt see the gate
but I eard voices and footsteps and a little while arterwards I see
that gal coming along the wharf arm in arm with the young man she ad
told me she didnt like and dancing for joy  They climbed on to the
schooner and then they both stooped down with their hands on their
knees and looked at me
Wot is it ses the young man grinning
Its a watchman ses the gal  Its here to take charge of the
wharf you know and see that nobody comes on
We ought to ha brought some buns for it ses the young man look at
it opening its mouth
They both laughed fit to kill themselves but I didnt move a muscle
You open the companion I ses or itll be the worse for you  Dye
hear  Open it
Oh Alfred ses the gal hes losing is temper  Wotever shall we
do
I dont want no more nonsense I ses trying to fix er with my eye
If you dont let me out itll be the worse for you
Dont you talk to my young lady like that ses the young man
Your young lady I ses  Hmm  You should ha seen er arf an hour
ago
The gal looked at me steady for a moment
He put is nasty fat arm round my waist Alfred she ses
Wot ses the young man squeaking  WOT
He snatched up the mop wot that nasty untidy cook ad left leaning
agin the side and afore I ad any idea of wot e was up to he shoved
the beastly thing straight in my face
Next time he ses Ill tear you limb from limb
I couldnt speak for a time and when I could e stopped me with the
mop agin  It was like a chained lion being tormented by a monkey  I
stepped down on to the cabin floor and then I told em both wot I
thought of em
Come along Alfred ses the gal else the cookll be back before we
start
Hes all right ses the young man  Minnies looking arter him
When I left hed got arf a bottle of whisky in front of im
Still we may as well go ses Miss Butt  It seems a shame to keep
the cab waiting
All right he ses  I just want to give this old chump one more lick
with the mop and then well go
He peeped down the skylight and waited but I kept quite quiet with my
back towards im
Come along ses Miss Butt
Im coming he ses  Hi  You down there  When the capn comes back
tell im that Im taking Miss Butt to an aunt o mine in the country
And tellim that in a week or two hell ave the largest and nicest
piece of weddingcake he as ever ad in his life  So long
Goodbye watchman ses the gal
They moved off without another wordfrom them I mean  I heard the
wicket slam and then I eard a cab drive off over the stones  I
couldnt believe it at first  I couldnt believe a gal with such
beautiful blue eyes could be so hardearted and for a long time I
stood listening and hoping to ear the cab come back  Then I stepped up
to the companion and tried to shift it with my shoulders
I went back to the cabin at last and arter lighting the lamp I ad
another sup o the skippers whisky to clear my ead and sat down to
try and think wot tale I was to tell im  I sat for pretty near three
hours without thinking of one and then I eard the crew come on to the
wharf
They was a bit startled when they saw my ead at the skylight and then
they all started at the same time asking me wot I was doing  I told em
to let me out fust and then Id tell em and one of em ad just
stepped round to the companion when the skipper come on to the wharf and
stepped aboard  He stooped down and peeped at me through the skylight
as though he couldnt believe is eyesight and then arter sending the
hands forard and telling em to stay there wotever appened he
unlocked the companion and came down
