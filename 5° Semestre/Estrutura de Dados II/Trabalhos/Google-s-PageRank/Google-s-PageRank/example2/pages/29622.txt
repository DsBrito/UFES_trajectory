THE PREFACE
It hath been the wisdom of the Church of England ever since the
first compiling of her Public Liturgy to keep the mean between
the two extremes of too much stiffness in refusing and of too
much easiness in admitting any variation from it For as on the
one side common experience sheweth that where a change hath been
made of things advisedly established no evident necessity so
requiring sundry inconveniences have thereupon ensued and those
many times more and greater than the evils that were intended to
be remedied by such change So on the other side the particular
Forms of Divine worship and the Rites and Ceremonies appointed to
be used therein being things in their own nature indifferent and
alterable and so acknowledged it is but reasonable that upon
weighty and important considerations according to the various
exigency of times and occasions such changes and alterations
should be made therein as to those that are in place of Authority
should from time to time seem either necessary or expedient
Accordingly we find that in the Reigns of several Princes of
blessed memory since the Reformation the Church upon just and
weighty considerations her thereunto moving hath yielded to make
such alterations in some particulars as in their respective
times were thought convenient Yet so as that the main Body and
Essentials of it as well in the chiefest materials as in the
frame and order thereof have still continued the same unto this
day and do yet stand firm and unshaken notwithstanding all the
vain attempts and impetuous assaults made against it by such men
as are given to change and have always discovered a greater
regard to their own private fancies and interests than to that
duty they owe to the public
By what undue means and for what mischievous purposes the use of
the Liturgy though enjoined by the Laws of the Land and those
Laws never yet repealed came during the late unhappy confusions
to be discontinued is too well known to the world and we are
not willing here to remember But when upon His Majestys happy
Restoration it seemed probable that amongst other things the
use of the Liturgy also would return of course the same having
never been legally abolished unless some timely means were used
to prevent it those men who under the late usurped powers had
made it a great part of their business to render the people
disaffected thereunto saw themselves in point of reputation and
interest concerned unless they would freely acknowledge themselves
to have erred which such men are very hardly brought to do with
their utmost endeavours to hinder the restitution thereof In
order whereunto divers Pamphlets were published against the Book
of Common Prayer the old Objections mustered up with the addition
of some new ones more than formerly had been made to make the
number swell In fine great importunities were used to His Sacred
Majesty that the said Book might be revised and such Alterations
therein and Additions thereunto made as should be thought
requisite for the ease of tender Consciences whereunto His
Majesty out of his pious inclination to give satisfaction so
far as could be reasonably expected to all his subjects of what
persuasion soever did graciously condescend
In which review we have endeavoured to observe the like moderation
as we find to have been used in the like case in former times
And therefore of the sundry Alterations proposed unto us we
have rejected all such as were either of dangerous consequence
as secretly striking at some established Doctrine or laudable
Practice of the Church of England or indeed of the whole Catholic
Church of Christ or else of no consequence at all but utterly
frivolous and vain But such Alterations as were tendered to us
by what persons under what pretences or to what purpose soever
so tendered as seemed to us in any degree requisite or expedient
we have willingly and of our own accord assented unto not
enforced so to do by any strength of Argument convincing us
of the necessity of making the said Alterations For we are
fully persuaded in our judgements and we here profess it to
the world that the Book as it stood before established by
Law doth not contain in it any thing contrary to the Word of
God or to sound Doctrine or which a godly man may not with a
good Conscience use and submit unto or which is not fairly
defensible against any that shall oppose the same if it shall
be allowed such just and favourable construction as in common
Equity ought to be allowed to all human Writings especially
such as are set forth by Authority and even to the very best
translations of the holy Scripture itself
Our general aim therefore in this undertaking was not to gratify
this or that party in any their unreasonable demands but to do
that which to our best understandings we conceived might most
tend to the preservation of Peace and Unity in the Church the
procuring of Reverence and exciting of Piety and Devotion in
the Public Worship of God and the cutting off occasion from
them that seek occasion of cavil or quarrel against the Liturgy
of the Church And as to the several variations from the former
Book whether by Alteration Addition or otherwise it shall
suffice to give this general account That most of the Alterations
were made either first for the better direction of them that
are to officiate in any part of Divine Service which is chiefly
done in the Kalendars and Rubrics Or secondly for the more
proper expressing of some words or phrases of ancient usage in
terms more suitable to the language of the present times and
the clearer explanation of some other words and phrases that
were either of doubtful signification or otherwise liable to
misconstruction Or thirdly for a more perfect rendering of
such portions of holy Scripture as are inserted into the Liturgy
which in the Epistles and Gospels especially and in sundry other
places are now ordered to be read according to the last
Translation and that it was thought convenient that some
Prayers and Thanksgivings fitted to special occasions should
be added in their due places particularly for those at Sea
together with an office for the Baptism of such as are of Riper
Years which although not so necessary when the former Book
was compiled yet by the growth of Anabaptism through the
licentiousness of the late times crept in amongst us is now
become necessary and may be always useful for the baptizing of
Natives in our Plantations and others converted to the Faith
If any man who shall desire a more particular account of the
several alterations in any part of the Liturgy shall take the
pains to compare the present Book with the former we doubt not
but the reason of the change may easily appear
And having thus endeavoured to discharge our duties in this
weighty affair as in the sight of God and to approve our
sincerity therein so far as lay in us to the consciences
of all men although we know it impossible in such variety
of apprehensions humours and interests as are in the world
to please all nor can expect that men of factious peevish
and perverse spirits should be satisfied with any thing that
can be done in this kind by any other than themselves Yet we
have good hope that what is here presented and hath been by
the Convocations of both Provinces with great diligence examined
and approved will be also well accepted and approved by all
sober peaceable and truly conscientious Sons of the Church of
England
CONCERNING THE SERVICE OF
THE CHURCH
There was never any thing by the wit of man so well devised or
so sure established which in continuance of time hath not been
corrupted As among other things it may plainly appear by the
Common Prayers in the Church commonly called Divine Service
The first original and ground whereof if a man would search out
by the ancient Fathers he shall find that the same was not
ordained but of a good purpose and for a great advancement of
godliness For they so ordered the matter that all the whole
Bible or the greatest part thereof should be read over once
every year intending thereby that the Clergy and especially
such as were Ministers in the congregation should by often
reading and meditation in Gods word be stirred up to godliness
themselves and be more able to exhort others by wholesome
doctrine and to confute them that were adversaries to the
truth and further that the people by daily hearing of holy
Scripture read in the Church might continually profit more and
more in the knowledge of God and be the more inflamed with the
love of his true Religion
But these many years passed this godly and decent order of the
ancient Fathers hath been so altered broken and neglected by
planting in uncertain Stories and Legends with multitude of
Responds Verses vain Repetitions Commemorations and Synodals
that commonly when any Book of the Bible was begun after three
or four Chapters were read out all the rest were unread And
in this sort the Book of Isaiah was begun in Advent and the
Book of Genesis in Septuagesima but they were only begun and
never read through After like sort were other Books of holy
Scripture used And moreover whereas St Paul would have such
language spoken to the people in the Church as they might
understand and have profit by hearing the same The Service in
this Church of England these many years hath been read in Latin
to the people which they understand not so that they have heard
with their ears only and their heart spirit and mind have not
been edified thereby And furthermore notwithstanding that the
ancient Fathers have divided the Psalms into seven Portions
whereof every one was called a Nocturn Now of late time a
few of them have been daily said and the rest utterly omitted
Moreover the number and hardness of the Rules called the Pie
and the manifold changings of the Service was the cause that to
turn the Book only was so hard and intricate a matter that many
times there was more business to find out what should be read
than to read it when it was found out
These inconveniences therefore considered here is set forth such
an Order whereby the same shall be redressed And for a readiness
in this matter here is drawn out a Kalendar for that purpose
which is plain and easy to be understood wherein so much as
may be the reading of holy Scripture is so set forth that
all things shall be done in order without breaking one piece
from another For this cause be cut off Anthems Responds
Invitatories and such like things as did break the continual
course of the reading of the Scripture
Yet because there is no remedy but that of necessity there must
be some Rules therefore certain Rules are here set forth which
as they are few in number so they are plain and easy to be
understood So that here you have an Order for Prayer and for
the reading of the holy Scripture much agreeable to the mind
and purpose of the old Fathers and a great deal more profitable
and commodious than that which of late was used It is more
profitable because here are left out many things whereof some
are untrue some uncertain some vain and superstitious and
nothing is ordained to be read but the very pure Word of God
the holy Scriptures or that which is agreeable to the same
and that in such a Language and Order as is most easy and plain
for the understanding both of the Readers and Hearers It is also
more commodious both for the shortness thereof and for the
plainness of the Order and for that the Rules be few and easy
And whereas heretofore there hath been great diversity in saying
and singing in Churches within this Realm some following Salisbury
Use some Hereford Use and some the Use of Bangor some of York
some of Lincoln now from henceforth all the whole Realm shall
have but one Use
And forasmuch as nothing can be so plainly set forth but doubts
may arise in the use and practice of the same to appease all
such diversity if any arise and for the resolution of all
doubts concerning the manner how to understand do and execute
the things contained in this Book the parties that so doubt or
diversely take any thing shall alway resort to the Bishop of the
Diocese who by his discretion shall take order for the quieting
and appeasing of the same so that the same order be not contrary
to any thing contained in this Book And if the Bishop of the
Diocese be in doubt then he may send for the resolution thereof
to the Archbishop
Though it be appointed That all things shall be read and sung in
the Church in the English Tongue to the end that the Congregation
may be thereby edified yet it is not meant but that when men
say Morning and Evening Prayer privately they may say the same
in any language that they themselves do understand
And all Priests and Deacons are to say daily the Morning and
Evening Prayer either privately or openly not being let by
sickness or some other urgent cause
And the Curate that ministereth in every Parish Church or Chapel
being at home and not being otherwise reasonably hindered
shall say the same in the Parish Church or Chapel where he
ministereth and shall cause a Bell to be tolled thereunto a
convenient time before he begin that the people may come to
hear Gods Word and to pray with him
OF CEREMONIES
WHY SOME BE ABOLISHED AND SOME RETAINED
Of such Ceremonies as be used in the Church and have had their
beginning by the institution of man some at the first were of
godly intent and purpose devised and yet at length turned to
vanity and superstition some entered into the Church by undiscreet
devotion and such a zeal as was without knowledge and for
because they were winked at in the beginning they grew daily to
more and more abuses which not only for their unprofitableness
but also because they have much blinded the people and obscured
the glory of God are worthy to be cut away and clean rejected
other there be which although they have been devised by man yet
it is thought good to reserve them still as well for a decent
order in the Church for the which they were first devised as
because they pertain to edification whereunto all things done in
the Church as the Apostle teacheth ought to be referred
And although the keeping or omitting of a Ceremony in itself
considered is but a small thing yet the wilful and contemptuous
transgression and breaking of a common order and discipline is
no small offence before God Let all things be done among you
saith Saint Paul in a seemly and due order The appointment of
the which order pertaineth not to private men therefore no man
ought to take in hand nor presume to appoint or alter any public
or common Order in Christs Church except he be lawfully called
and authorized thereunto
And whereas in this our time the minds of men are so diverse
that some think it a great matter of conscience to depart from a
piece of the least of their Ceremonies they be so addicted to
their old customs and again on the other side some be so
newfangled that they would innovate all things and so despise
the old that nothing can like them but that is new it was
thought expedient not so much to have respect how to please
and satisfy either of these parties as how to please God and
profit them both And yet lest any man should be offended whom
good reason might satisfy here be certain causes rendered why
some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put away and some retained
and kept still
Some are put away because the great excess and multitude of them
hath so increased in these latter days that the burden of them
was intolerable whereof Saint Augustine in his time complained
that they were grown to such a number that the estate of Christian
people was in worse case concerning that matter than were the
Jews And he counselled that such yoke and burden should be taken
away as time would serve quietly to do it But what would Saint
Augustine have said if he had seen the Ceremonies of late days
used among us whereunto the multitude used in his time was not
to be compared This our excessive multitude of Ceremonies was
so great and many of them so dark that they did more confound
and darken than declare and set forth Christs benefits unto us
And besides this Christs Gospel is not a Ceremonial Law as
much of Moses Law was but it is a Religion to serve God not
in bondage of the figure or shadow but in the freedom of the
Spirit being content only with those Ceremonies which do serve
to a decent Order and godly Discipline and such as be apt to
stir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to
God by some notable and special signification whereby he might
be edified Furthermore the most weighty cause of the abolishment
of certain Ceremonies was That they were so far abused partly
by the superstitious blindness of the rude and unlearned and
partly by the unsatiable avarice of such as sought more their
own lucre than the glory of God that the abuses could not well
be taken away the thing remaining still
But now as concerning those persons which peradventure will be
offended for that some of the old Ceremonies are retained still
If they consider that without some Ceremonies it is not possible
to keep any Order or quiet Discipline in the Church they shall
easily perceive just cause to reform their judgements And if
they think much that any of the old do remain and would rather
have all devised anew then such men granting some Ceremonies
convenient to be had surely where the old may be well used
there they cannot reasonably reprove the old only for their age
without bewraying of their own folly For in such a case they
ought rather to have reverence unto them for their antiquity if
they will declare themselves to be more studious of unity and
concord than of innovations and newfangleness which as much
as may be with the true setting forth of Christs Religion is
always to be eschewed Furthermore such shall have no just cause
with the Ceremonies reserved to be offended For as those be taken
away which were most abused and did burden mens consciences
without any cause so the other that remain are retained for a
discipline and order which upon just causes may be altered
and changed and therefore are not to be esteemed equal with
Gods Law And moreover they be neither dark nor dumb Ceremonies
but are so set forth that every man may understand what they do
mean and to what use they do serve So that it is not like that
they in time to come should be abused as other have been And in
these our doings we condemn no other Nations nor prescribe any
thing but to our own people only For we think it convenient that
every Country should use such Ceremonies as they shall think best
to the setting forth of Gods honour and glory and to the reducing
of the people to a most perfect and godly living without error or
superstition and that they should put away other things which
from time to time they perceive to be most abused as in mens
ordinances it often chanceth diversely in divers countries
THE ORDER HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED
TO BE READ
The Psalter shall be read through once every Month as it is there
appointed both for Morning and Evening Prayer But in February
it shall be read only to the twentyeighth or twentyninth day of
the Month
And whereas January March May July August October
and December have Oneandthirty days apiece It is ordered
that the same Psalms shall be read the last day of the said months
which were read the day before So that the Psalter may begin
again the first day of the next month ensuing
And whereas the 119th Psalm is divided into twentytwo portions
and is overlong to be read at one time It is so ordered that
at one time shall not be read above four or five of the said
portions
And at the end of every Psalm and of every such part of the
119th Psalm shall be repeated this Hymn
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Ghost
As it was in the beginning is now and ever shall be world
without end Amen
Note that the Psalter followeth the Division of the Hebrews
and the Translation of the great English Bible set forth and
used in the time of King Henry the Eighth and Edward the Sixth
THE ORDER HOW THE REST OF HOLY
SCRIPTURE IS APPOINTED TO BE READ
The Old Testament is appointed for the First Lessons at Morning
and Evening Prayer so as the most part thereof will be read
every year once as in the Kalendar is appointed
The New Testament is appointed for the Second Lessons at Morning
and Evening Prayer and shall be read over orderly every year
twice once in the morning and once in the evening besides the
Epistles and Gospels except the Apocalypse out of which there
are only certain Lessons appointed at the end of the year and
certain Proper Lessons appointed upon divers feasts
And to know what Lessons shall be read every day look for the
day of the Month in the Kalendar following and there ye shall
find the chapters and portions of chapters that shall be read
for the Lessons both at Morning and Evening Prayer except only
the moveable feasts which are not in the Kalendar and the
immoveable where there is a blank left in the column of Lessons
the Proper Lessons for all which days are to be found in the
Table of Proper Lessons
If Evening Prayer is said at two different times in the same
place of worship on any Sunday except a Sunday for which
alternative Second Lessons are specially appointed in the Table
the Second Lesson at the second time may at the discretion of
the minister be any chapter from the four Gospels or any
Lesson appointed in the Table of Lessons from the four Gospels
Upon occasions to be approved by the Ordinary other Lessons may
with his consent be substituted for those which are appointed in
the Kalendar
And note That whensoever Proper Psalms or Lessons are appointed
then the Psalms and Lessons of ordinary course appointed in the
Psalter and Kalendar if they be different shall be omitted for
that time
Note also That upon occasions to be appointed by the Ordinary
other Psalms may with his consent be substituted for those
appointed in the Psalter
If any of the Holydays for which Proper Lessons are appointed in
the Table fall upon a Sunday which is the first Sunday in Advent
Easterday Whitsunday or Trinity Sunday the Lessons appointed
for such Sunday shall be read but if it fall upon any other
Sunday the Lessons appointed either for the Sunday or for the
Holyday may be read at the discretion of the minister
