GLOUCESTER CATHEDRAL
CHAPTER I
HISTORY OF THE BUILDING
It is neither possible nor desirable within the limits of a book of
this size and scope to go fully into the question interesting though
it be of the relative claims of Aldred and Serlo to the honour of the
first building of the Abbey of Gloucester Professor Willis in his
lecture addressed to the meeting of the Archological Institute held at
Gloucester in 1860 after giving various reasons for believing that the
crypt dates back no further than 1089 when the foundationstone was
laid by Abbot Serlo goes on to state that he was clearly of opinion
that when the foundations of the cathedral were laid the crypt was
planned to receive the existing superstructure and no other
Professor Freeman in his lecture published in the Records of
Gloucester Cathedral says The first thing we do know for certain is
that in the year 1089 thirtyone years only after the dedication of
Ealdreds church Serlo the first Norman Abbot began the building of a
new church which was itself dedicated in 1100
From the record quoted by Mr W H Hart Chartulary i 3 the first
mention of the abbey is in 681 when it was founded by Osric viceroy of
King Ethelred It was dedicated to St Peter and Kyneburga the sister
of Osric was the first Abbess of a double foundation for monks and
nuns She died in 710
Osric himself was buried in his church in 729 Hart i 5 and his
sister was buried near him in front of the altar of St Petronilla
which was on the north side of the then existing church
The second Abbess was also a lady of royal descent and widow of
Wulphere King of the Mercians She died in 735 and with Eve or Eva or
Gaffa her successor who died in 769 the monastery came to an end
In 823 a new regime beganviz that of secular priests introduced by
Beornwulf King of Mercia and the Monasticon Anglicanum Caley i
563 says that he found the monastery spoliatum et ruinosum and
therefore rebuilt it He also changed its constitution by introducing
secular priests of whom many were married to lawful wives and who were
very little different in their way of living to other secular
Christians This state of things went on till 1022 when Cnut as Leland
says for ill lyvynge expellyd secular clerks and by the counsell of
Wolstane Wulfstan Bysshope of Wurcestar bringethe in monkes The
monks introduced by Cnut were of the Benedictine rule or Black monks
as Parker calls them in his Rhythmical History of the Abbey
This change was effected about the same time in many other places in
England but was not generally popular and certainly was not so in
Gloucester Abbot Parker in his rhyming account of the founding of the
abbey says that in 1030
A lord of great puissance named Ulfine Le Rewe
Was enjoyned by the Pope for ever to finde
Satisfying for the seaven priests that he slew
7 monkes for them to pray world without minde
Mr Hope in his Notes on the Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at
Gloucester 1897 p 2 says The Benedictines thus introduced by Cnut
do not seem to have been a success and after an existence of
thirtyseven years under a weak Abbot whose long rule was marked by
great decay of discipline the Memoriale Dugdale i 564 says
God permitted them to be extirpated and the monastery in which they
were established to be devoured by the fiercest flames and the very
foundations and buildings to be rent asunder razed to the ground and
utterly destroyed
The monastery was next taken in hand by Aldred Bishop of Worcester
who in 1058 reestablished the monks He also began to build a new
church from the foundations and dedicated it in honour of St
Peter1
Until now the monastery seems to have occupied the same site throughout
its chequered history but the Memoriale states that Aldred began
the new church a little further from the place where it had first
stood and nearer to the side of the city
The language of these authorities is quite plain but the interpretation
thereof is not so evident As Professor Freeman said By the time when
the oldest church of which we have any part remaining came into being
the Roman Wall or at least this corner of it must have pretty well
passed away It seems clear that the side of the city cannot refer
to the Roman Wall To quote Professor Freeman again The existing
church is something more than near to the Roman Wall It actually stands
over its northwest corner
Even under Aldreds auspices the monastery did not altogether flourish
But this time it was through the fault of Aldred himself for on his
translation to York in 1060 he retained very many of the possessions of
the abbey that had been pledged to him on account of his expenses in
repairing and reedifying the church
In 1072 Wilstan Wulstan the Abbot consecrated by Aldred in 1058
died and was succeeded by Serlo who found the convent reduced to two
monks and eight novices Through his energy the monastery increased to
such an extent that in about fifteen years time it became necessary to
rebuild the monastery
This rebuilding was begun exactly thirtyone years after Aldred had
built his church de nova and a fundamentis Why was this necessary
Professor Freeman says The reason is not very far to seek for any one
who has really mastered the history of architecture during the eleventh
century The simple fact is that the Norman prelates pulled down and
rebuilt the English churches mainly because they thought them too
small Further on he says This proves that of the two types of
church which were in use side by side in the days of the Confessor
Aldred had followed the older type He had not conformed to the new
Norman fashions vast size among them which were coming in after the
example of the kings own church at Westminster His church was built
in the Primitive Romanesque style the style common to England with
Germany Italy and Burgundy not in the newlydeveloped style of
Northern Gaul Therefore neither its scale nor its style suited the
ideas of Abbot Serlo2 It was condemned and the minster that now
stands was begun
In the MS Lives of the Abbots in Queens College Library Oxford it is
stated that in AD 1089 on the day of the festival of the Apostles
Peter and Paul in this year were laid the foundations of the church
ecclesia of Gloucester the venerable man Robert Bishop of Hereford
laying the first stone Serlo the Abbot being in charge of the work
So too Hart i 11
In August 1089 there was an earthquake which did serious damage to the
then existing building Eleven years after this 1100 in the last year
of the reign of William Rufus the church as Florence of Worcester
wrote which Abbot Serlo of revered memory had built from the
foundations at Gloucester was dedicated on Sunday July 15th with
great pomp by Samson Bishop of Worcester Gundulf Bishop of Rochester
Gerard Bishop of Hereford and Herveas Bishop of Bangor This
dedication under Serlos regime is the last authentic record for some
years
Nothing is known exactly as to how much of the building was completed by
1100 Professor Freeman points out that eleven years was quite long
enough for its building and that there is no hint in the local
chronicle of any additions being made to the building dedicated in 1100
Probably part of the church was finished for the dedication such as the
presbytery choir the transepts the Abbots cloister the
chapterhouse and the greater part at any rate of the nave
The nave though so different in scale as compared with the original
choir must have been built very early in the twelfth century and like
the rest of the building originally had a wooden roof
In 1101 or 1102 damage was done to the building by fire notably the
chapterhouse and again in 1122 Possibly in this latter fire the nave
roof was destroyed and of this fire the piers in the nave show traces
Of the same date must be much of the strengthening masonry in the crypt
the Priors lodging the chapel and the slype beneath it
The whole of the Abbey buildings were surrounded by Abbot Peter with a
stone wall and the necessary gatesviz the great gatehouse on the
west another on the south and a third more to the east All these can
be identified from the small plan of the monastic buildings reproduced
p 103 by permission of Mr F S Waller The Saxon Chronicle tells us
that in 1122 while the monks were singing mass fire burst out from the
upper part of the steeple and burnt the whole monastery Some time
between 1164 and 1179 one of the western towers probably the southwest
tower fell down Fire in 1190 is said to have destroyed the greater
part of the city as well as almost all the buildings in the outer
court Helias the sacrist also made new stalls for the monks in the
choir Of these Early English stalls a fragment has been thoughtfully
and carefully preserved behind the seat of the Canon in residence
In 1222 we learn from Hart i 25 that the great eastern tower was
built under the direction of Helias of Hereford the sacrist Of this
tower no traces now remain Helias built his superstructure on the
Norman work that we see in the nave
The Early English Lady Chapel was said to have been built between the
years 12241227 by Ralph of Wylington and Olympias his wife and
endowed with lands
The church was dedicated again in 1239 in Abbot Foliots time by
Walter of Cantelupe the patriot prelate who sixandtwenty years
later stood by Earl Simon on the day of martyrdom at Evesham
Three years after the dedication in 1242 alterations in the triforium of
the nave were made and the stone vaulting was done by the monks
themselves It was a very laudable object but they effectually spoiled
the nave The same year saw the beginning of the rebuilding of the
southwest tower and it was finished before 1246 If this was the tower
that collapsed in 1170 the monks would seem to have somewhat neglected
their duty to the fabric The Norman refectory or frater was
demolished in 1246 and the new one begun This building stood to the
north of the cloisters and was pulled down at the Dissolution Of the
Early English infirmary or farmery traces remain near the Bishops
Palace
In this place we may refer incidentally to Gloucester Hall Oxford
which college was founded in 1283 as a residence for thirteen monks to
be chosen out of the brotherhood at Gloucester and sent to study at
Oxford The hall was empowered later on to receive students from other
Benedictine foundations and the buildings were enlarged for this
purpose in 1298
Fire again ravaged the Abbey and its precincts in 1300 on the feast of
the Epiphany It began in a timbered house in the great court from
which it spread to the small belltower the great camera and the
cloister Hope 36 Mr Hope thinks this belltower was either a single
western tower as formerly there was at Hereford or else a Norman
northwest tower and that the great camera was part of the Abbots
house now the Deanery Professor Freeman thinks that the small
belltower or parvum campanile was so called as being less in height
than the southwest tower rebuilt in 12456
In this same fire the Norman dorter or dormitory suffered considerable
damage It was pulled down three years later and a new one which took
ten years to build was opened for use in 1313 after being blessed and
sprinkled with holy water by the Bishop of St Davids 1318 is a date
of importance in the history of the Abbey John Thokey Abbot from
13071329 made many changes He reconstructed the south aisle of the
nave to save the south side from collapse The windows on the outside
have been restored but the buttresses have been very little touched
Most of the tracery in the windows of the aisles and chapels of the
choir and the triforium of the choir date back to his time
Thokey between 13161329 built the new camera of the Abbot beside the
infirmary garden Hart i 55
Thokeys successor Wygmore carried out the works planned previously
and in 13311337 the south transept was recased and vaulted practically
as we see it today in the style now known as Perpendicular Part of
the front of the Deanery is presumably of the same date though many
later alterations have been made in it Wygmore also built the double
screen vide p 44 which separated the nave from the choir Parts of
it says Mr Hope are worked up in the present screen and he quotes
Hart i 47 to show that Wygmore was buried in 1337 before the
Salutation of the Blessed Mary in the entry of the quire on the south
side which he himself constructed with the pulpitum or loft in the
same place
The transformation of the Norman minster had thus begun In the days of
Adam de Staunton 13371357 the great vault of the choir was made at a
great expense together with the stalls on the Priors sideie the
north side
The oblations at the tomb of Edward II rendered much of his extensive
work practicable as the funds of the Abbey were becoming exhausted
Thomas Horton 13511377 finished the work comprising the high altar
with the presbytery the stalls on the Abbots side or south side of
the choir Hart i 49
He also caused to be made the images and tabernacle work at the entrance
of the choir on the north side and in the six years ending with 1374
he completed the casing of the north transept defraying the greater
part of the cost himself 444 0s 2d out of a total sum of 781 0s
2d
Horton also built the Abbots chapel near the garden of the infirmary
the covered camera of the monks hostelry and the great hall in the
court where the king afterwards held his Parliament in 1378 Hart i
48 50
The present cloister as far as the door of the chapterhouse is also
his work
This important work was for many years unfinished but was completed by
Froucester in the years 13811407 As Leland says he made the cloyster
a right goodly and sumptuous piece of worke
In the one hundred and thirty years that elapsed between the finishing
of the cloisters and the Dissolution many further important changes took
place both in the interior and in the exterior of the fabric
John Morwent 14211437 utterly destroyed the west front with its two
towers which in the opinion of many may have been counterparts of
those at Tewkesbury To him also is credited mainly on Lelands
authority the insertion of the south porch
Abbot Seabroke 14501457 took down the tower as far as the Norman
piers and built the present beautiful structure He died before it was
finished and Robert Tully one of the monks of the monastery carried
out the work as the inscription on the wall in the interior vide p
63 testifies
Before the tower was complete the present Lady Chapel which was
finished before 1500 was begun by Abbot Hanley and finished by Abbot
Farley
John the Baptists Chapel is usually ascribed to Abbot John Browne or
Newton from the similarity of his initials to those of the saint
The eastern bay of the chapterhouse dates back to Abbot Hanleys
timeie between 14571472
In 1540 Henry VIII sent his commissioners and they demanded the
surrender of the Abbey to the king This cannot have been a surprise to
any of the monks who were in the Abbey at the time As far back as 1534
they had all been compelled to take the oath by which they acknowledged
the king as supreme head of the Church of England and denied that any
foreign bishop had any authority in these realms
The monks too had seen the smaller monasteries in Gloucester dissolved
two years before and the more thoughtful of them must have foreseen
that it was a mere question of time for the greedy king to absorb the
larger monasteries as well
Abbot Parkers tomb and also that of King Osric practically date
themselves and of the same period are presumably the gateway into
Palace Yard and part of the Abbots lodging on the site of the present
Bishops Palace From Leland we learn that the south gateie King
Edwards gateis of the same date having been rebuilt by Osborne the
cellarer
The library and the set of rooms beneath it now used as vestry and
practiceroom for the choir are perhaps the latest additions to the
buildings
At the Dissolution the Abbey which had existed for more than eight
centuries under different forms in poverty and in wealth in meanness
and in magnificence in misfortune and success finally succumbed to the
royal will The day came and that a drear winter day when its last
mass was sung its last censer waved its last congregation bent in rapt
and lowly adoration before the altar there and doubtless as the last
tones of that days evensong died away in the vaulted roof there were
not wanting those who lingered in the solemn stillness of the old
massive pile and who as the lights disappeared one by one felt that
there was a void which could never be filled because their old abbey
with its beautiful services its frequent means of grace its
hospitality to strangers and its loving care for Gods poor had
passed away like a morning dream and was gone for ever Hart iii
49
The charter of Henry VIII founding the see is too long to quote in
extenso but it stated that Whereas the great convent or monastery
which whilst still in being was called the monastery of St Peter of
Gloucester  and all and singular its manors  and possessions
for certain special and urgent causes were by Gabriel Moreton Prior of
the said abbey or monastery and the convent thereof lately given and
granted to us and our heirs for ever We being influenced by divine
goodness and desiring above all things that true religion and the
true worship of God may not only not be abolished but entirely restored
to the primitive and genuine rule of simplicity and that all those
enormities may be corrected into which the lives and profession of the
monks for a long time had deplorably lapsed have as far as human
frailty will permit endeavoured to the utmost that for the future the
pure word of God may be taught in that place good discipline
preserved
The charter goes on to say that considering the site of the said late
monastery in which many famous monuments of our renowned ancestors
Kings of England are erected is a very fit and proper place  we
have decreed that the site of the said monastery be an episcopal see
We also will and ordain that the said Dean and Prebendaries and their
successors shall for ever hereafter be called the Dean and Chapter of
the Holy and Individed Trinity of Gloucester Henry also assigned to
the Bishop all the premises formerly occupied by the Abbot
In 1576 the fabric seems to have been in want of considerable repair
and in 1616 when Dr Laud was Dean it was said of it that there was
scarcely a church in England so much in decay The Dean procured an Act
of the Chapter by which the sum of 60 per annum was to be allowed for
repairs
In the time of the civil war it suffered less than might have been
expected It was subsequently in danger of total destruction from the
machinations of some persons who are said to have agreed amongst
themselves for their several proportions of the plunder expected out of
it The little cloisters and the Lady Chapel were begun to be pulled
down and instruments and tackle provided for to take down the tower
but in 1657 the church was made over by grant to the mayor and burgesses
at their request and from this it is to be assumed that they wished to
prevent it from possible ruin Mr Dorney speaking in 1653 recommends
to the officers of the city then elected that they would together
with others join their shoulders to hold up the stately fabric of the
College Church the great ornament of this city which some do say is
now in danger of falling
In 1679 we find an insensate prebendary securing an order from the
Chapter for destroying some of the old glass in the west window of the
choir Bishop Benson 17341752 spent vast sums of money on the
building and to him are due the paving of the nave and pinnacles to
the Lady Chapel which were removed at a recent restoration A stone
screen removed in 1820 was erected at the entrance to the choir by
this energetic Bishop and his architect Kent in whose hands he was
suggested the fluting of the pillars of the nave
Fifty years ago in 1847 under the energetic administration of Dr
Jeune the Treasurer extensive repairs and improvements were begun by
Mr F S Waller The crypt was drained concreted and later on glazed
The grounds round the cathedral have been lowered enlarged and laid
out and the drainage has been properly done Of the restorations during
the last fifty years mention has been made in detail in the description
of the various parts of the building that have been restored and there
is no need to repeat
Restoration is a cause of much strife and in the hands of many
architects it means destruction of the original features of the
building Gloucester has suffered somewhat at the hands of Sir Gilbert
Scott but probably not a tithe of what would have been inflicted upon
it had Wyatt been turned loose with an absolutely free hand Mr Waller
writing in 1890 said Forty years ago everything not Gothic the
fashion of the day was destroyed but were it possible now to reinstate

Wygmores pulpit the aisle screens the remains of the Rood Loft and
the Choir fittings and to put them all backodd mixture as they would
beto the positions they occupied in 1727 few would be found to
object even though the replacement of the monuments on the columns of
the nave became one of the conditionsTruly Tempora mutantur

DedicationThe building of Osric was dedicated to St Peter by
Theodore Archbishop of Canterbury and Bosel Bishop of Worcester When
Bishop Wulfstan ejected the secular canons and brought in his
Benedictine monks he reconsecrated it to St Peter and St Paul
Bishop Aldred after building de novo rededicated the church to St
Peter as the chief of the apostles Abbot Serlo seems to have
remembered the earlier dedication to St Peter and St Paul for he
caused the foundationstone to be laid in 1089 on the festival of those
two apostles in June but his dedication in 1100 was to St Peter Both
St Peter and St Paul are now represented among the statues on the
front of the south porch After the dissolution of the monastery Henry
VIII ascribed the Cathedral Church to the Holy and Individed Trinity
The Cathedral is traditionally by many called St Peters and by some
The Abbey Church but this of course is quite inaccurate
Apropos of the question of the dedication the arms of the see may be
briefly considered
The original arms were Azure two keys in saltire or
By the fifteenth century the sword for St Paul had become incorporated
with the crossed keys and it is found upon the bells and also on the
east side of the organ case At the Dissolution the arms were Gules two
keys in saltire surmounted by a sword in pale argent Brown Willis in
1727 wrote that the old arms of this see as used 100 years ago were
three chevronels the middle one charged with a mitre but the bishops
now give Azure two keys in saltire or

CHAPTER II
THE EXTERIOR
Of the building as originally constructed practically the whole as far
as the outline is concerned may be said to remain as it was at the
beginning of the twelfth century The massive Norman nave the slype or
covered passage that is between the Deanery and the northwest wall of
the cathedral the two transepts with their turrets the choir with its
various chapels and aisles the chapterhouse and the Abbots cloister
are all parts of the original building although later additions have
partly concealed them
In Mr Wallers Notes and Sketches of Gloucester Cathedral1 a very
interesting view is given of the cathedral stripped of every addition of
a later date than the original structure and by his permission it is
here reproduced
With reference to this sketch Mr Waller says
This sketch is given to shew what is left of the old Abbey Church
of the twelfth century and looking to the fact that it was not too
reliable a structure to begin with as regards foundation and
