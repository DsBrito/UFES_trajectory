HOW OLD KING EAGLE WON HIS WHITE HEAD
MOTHER WEST WIND HOW STORIES
I
HOW OLD KING EAGLE WON HIS WHITE HEAD
Peter Rabbit sat on the edge of the dear Old Briarpatch staring up
into the sky with his head tipped back until it made his neck ache Way
way up in the sky was a black speck sailing across the snowy white face
of a cloud It didnt seem possible that it could be alive way up there
But it was Peter knew that it was and he knew who it was It was King
Eagle By and by it disappeared over towards the Great Mountain Peter
rubbed the back of his neck which ached because he had tipped his head
back so long Then he gave a little sigh
I wonder what it seems like to be able to fly like that said he out
loud a way he sometimes has
Are you envious asked a voice so close to him that Peter jumped
There was Sammy Jay sitting in a little tree just over his head
No snapped Peter for it made him a wee bit cross to be so startled
No Im not envious Sammy Jay Im not envious of any bird The ground
is good enough for me I was just wondering thats all
Have you ever seen King Eagle close to asked Sammy
Once replied Peter Once he came down to the Green Meadows and sat
in that lone tree over there and I was squatting in a bunch of grass
quite near and could see him very plainly He is big and fiercelooking
but he looks his name every inch a king Ive wondered a good many
times since how it happens that he has a white head
Because replied Sammy he is just what he looks to beking of the
birdsand that white head is the sign of his royalty given his
greatgreateversogreatgrandfather by Old Mother Nature way back in
the beginning of things
Peters eyes sparkled Tell me about it Sammy he begged Tell me
about it and I wont quarrel with you any more
All right Peter Ill tell you the story because it will do you good
to hear it I supposed everybody knew it All birds do That is why we
all look up to King Eagle replied Sammy
Way back in the beginning of things old King Bear ruled in the Green
Forest as you know That is he ruled the animals and all the little
people who lived on the ground but he didnt rule the birds You see
the birds were not willing to be ruled over by an animal They wanted
one of their own kind So they refused to have old King Bear as their
king and went to Old Mother Nature to ask her to appoint a king of the
air Now Mr Eagle was one of the biggest and strongest and most
respected of all the birds of the air There were some like Mr Goose
and Mr Swan who were bigger but they spent most of their time on the
water or the earth and they had no great claws or hooked beak to
command respect as did Mr Eagle So Old Mother Nature made Mr Eagle
king of the air and as was quite right and proper all the birds
hastened to pay him homage
So King Eagle ruled the air and none dared to cross him or to disobey
him Unlike old King Bear he accepted no tribute from his subjects but
hunted for himself and instead of growing fat and lazy as did old King
Bear he grew stronger of wing and feared no one and nothing Now this
was in the days when the world was young and Old Mother Nature was very
busy trying to make the world a good place to live in so she had very
little time to look after the birds and the animals Thus she left
matters very much to King Eagle and old King Bear They settled all the
quarrels between their subjects and for a while everything went
smoothly
King Eagle made his home on the cliff of a mountain so that he could
look down on all below and see what was going on Every day he went down
to the Green Forest and sat on the tallest tree while he listened to the
complaints of the other birds and settled their disputes and none
questioned his decisions Now after a while this little part of the
earth where the animals and the birds first lived became overcrowded It
became harder and harder to get enough to eat Quarrels became more
frequent until King Eagle had little time for anything but
straightening out these troubles and trying to keep peace
Old Mother Nature had been away a long time trying to make other parts
of the world fit to live in No one knew when she was coming back or
just where she was King Eagle sitting on the edge of the cliff on the
mountain thought it all over Old Mother Nature ought to know how
things were He would send a messenger to try to find her So the next
day he called all the birds together and asked who would go out into the
unknown Great World to look for Old Mother Nature and take a message to
her
No one offered This one had a family to look after That one was not
feeling well Another had a pain in his wings One and all they had an
excuse until Hummer the tiniest of all the birds was reached He
darted into the air before King Eagle Ill go said he
All the others laughed The very idea of such a tiny fellow going out
to dare the dangers of the unknown Great World seemed to them so absurd
that they just had to laugh But King Eagle didnt laugh He thanked
Hummer and told him that his heart was as big as his body was small
but that he would not send him out into the Great World for he would go
himself He had been but trying out his subjects and he had found but
one who was worthy and that one was the smallest of them all Then King
Eagle said things that made all the other birds hang their heads for
shame and want to sneak out of sight
After that he told them that no king who was worthy to be king would
ask his subjects to do what he would not do himself and that where
there was danger to be faced or something hard to do it was the kings
place to do it so he himself was going out into the unknown Great World
to find Mother Nature and see what could be done to make things better
and happier for them Then he spread his great wings and sailed away
every inch a king They watched him until he was a speck in the sky
and finally he disappeared altogether
Day after day they watched for him to come back but there was no sign
of him they began to shake their heads and openly talk of choosing a
new king Only little Mr Hummer kept his faith and day after day flew
away in the direction old King Eagle had gone hoping to meet him coming
back At last a day was set to choose a new king That morning as soon
as it was light enough to see little Mr Hummer darted away and his
heart was heavy He would take no part in choosing a new king He would
go until he found King Eagle or until something happened to him Pretty
soon he saw a speck way up against a cloud a speck no bigger than
himself It grew bigger and bigger and at last he knew that it was
King Eagle himself Little Mr Hummer turned and flew as he never had
flown before He wanted to get back before a new king was chosen so
that King Eagle might never know that his subjects had lost faith in
him
He was so out of breath when he reached the other birds that he
couldnt say a word for a few minutes Then he told them that King Eagle
was coming The other birds had proved that they were not brave when
they had refused to go out in search of Old Mother Nature and now they
proved it again Instead of waiting to give King Eagle a royal welcome
they hurried away one after another They were afraid to meet him
because in their hearts they knew that they had done a cowardly thing in
deciding to choose a new king So when King Eagle weary and with torn
wings and broken tail feathers dropped down to the tall tree in the
Green Forest there was none to give him greeting save little Mr
Hummer
King Eagle said nothing about the failure of the other birds to give
him greeting but at once sent little Mr Hummer around to tell all the
others that far away he had found Old Mother Nature preparing a new land
for them and that when she gave the word he would lead them to it
Then King Eagle flew to his home on the cliff of the mountain and not
one word did he ever say of his terrible journey of how he had gone
hungry had been beaten by storms and had suffered from cold and
weariness yet never once had turned back
But when Old Mother Nature came later and announced that the new land
was ready for the birds she first called them together and told them
all that King Eagle had suffered and how he had proved himself a royal
king As a reward she promised that his family should be rulers over the
birds forever and as a sign that this should be so she reached forth
and touched his black head and it became snowy white and all the birds
cried Long live the king
Then Old Mother Nature turned to tiny Mr Hummer and touched his
throat and behold a shining ruby was there the reward of loyalty
faith and bravery
Then King Eagle mounted into the air and proudly led the way to the
promised land And so the birds went forth and peopled the Great World
and King Eagle and his children and his childrens children have ruled
the air ever since and have worn the snowy crown which King Eagle of
long ago so bravely won

HOW OLD MR MINK TAUGHT HIMSELF TO SWIM
II
HOW OLD MR MINK TAUGHT HIMSELF TO SWIM
Of all the little people who live in the Green Forest or on the Green
Meadows or around the Smiling Pool Billy Mink has the most
accomplishments At least it seems that way to his friends and
neighbors He can run very swiftly he can climb very nimbly his eyes
and his ears and his nose are all wonderfully keen andhe can swim
like a fish Yes Sir Billy Mink is just as much at home in the water
as out of it So wherever he happens to be in the Green Forest out on
the Green Meadows along the Laughing Brook or in the Smiling Pool he
feels perfectly at home and quite able to look out for himself
Once Billy Mink had boasted that he could do anything that any one else
who wore fur could do but boasters almost always come to grief and
Grandfather Frog had brought Billy to grief that time He had invited
every one to meet at the Smiling Pool and see Billy Mink do whatever any
one else who wore fur could do and then when Billy had run and jumped
and climbed and swum Grandfather Frog had called Flitter the Bat There
was some one wearing fur who could fly and of course Billy Mink
couldnt do that It cured Billy of boastingfor a while anyway
Now Peter Rabbit who can do little but run and jump used sometimes to
feel a wee bit of envy in his heart when he thought of all the things
that Billy Mink could do and do well Somehow Peter could never make it
seem quite right that one person should be able to do so many things
when others could do only one or two things He said as much to
Grandfather Frog one day as they watched Billy Mink catch a fat trout
Chugarum said Grandfather Frog and looked sharply at Peter
Chugarum People never know what they can do till they try Once upon
a time Billy Minks greatgreateversogreatgrandfather couldnt swim
any more than you can but he didnt waste any time foolishly wishing
that he could
What did he do asked Peter eagerly
Learned how replied Grandfather Frog gruffly Made it his business
to learn how Then he taught his children and they taught their
children and after a long time it came natural to the Mink family to
swim
Did it take old Mr Mink very long to learn how asked Peter
wistfully
Quite a while replied Grandfather Frog Quite a while Perhaps you
would like to hear about it
Oh if you please Grandfather Frog cried Peter If you please I
should love dearly to hear about it Perhaps then I can learn to swim
Grandfather Frog snapped up a foolish green fly that happened his way
and Peter heard something that sounded very much like a chuckle He
looked at Grandfather Frog suspiciously Was that chuckle because of the
foolish green fly or was Grandfather Frog laughing at him Peter wasnt
sure
It all happened a long time ago when the world was young as a great
many other things happened began Grandfather Frog Old Mr Mink the
eversogreatgrandfather of Billy Mink couldnt do all the things that
Billy can now For instance he couldnt swim But he could do a great
many things and he was very smart It has always run in the Mink family
to be smart He dressed very much as Billy does now except that he
didnt have the waterproof coat that Billy has And he was a great
traveler just as Billy is Everybody smaller than he and some who were
bigger were a little bit afraid of old Mr Mink for he was quite as sly
and cunning as Mr Fox and it was suspected that he knew a great deal
more than he ever admitted about eggs that were stolen and nests that
were broken up and other strange things that happened in the Green
Forest and along the Laughing Brook But he never was caught doing
anything wrong and always seemed to be minding his own business so all
things considered he got along very well with his neighbors
Now Mr Mink was small and spry and his wits were as nimble as his
feet He saw all that was going on about him and he was wise enough to
keep his tongue still so that it never got him into trouble as gossipy
tongues do some people I know
Peter Rabbit fidgeted uneasily It seemed to him that Grandfather Frog
had looked at him very hard when he said this But Grandfather Frog just
cleared his throat and went on with his story
Yes Sir old Mr Mink kept his eyes wide open and his ears wide open
and the wits in his little brown head always working He noticed that
those who were fussy about what they ate and insisted on having a
special kind of food often went hungry or had to hunt long and hard to
find what they liked so he made up his mind to learn to eat many kinds
of food This is how it happens that he learned to like fish His big
cousin Mr Otter often caught a bigger fish than he could eat all
himself and would leave some of it on the bank Mr Mink would find it
and help himself
But having to depend on Mr Otter to get the fish for him didnt suit
Mr Mink at all In the first place he didnt have as much as he
wanted And then again he didnt have it when he wanted it If I could
learn to catch fish for myself I would be much better off thought Mr
Mink After this he spent a great deal of time on the banks of the
Smiling Pool watching Mr Otter swim to see just how he did it If he
can swim I can swim said Mr Mink to himself and went off up the
Laughing Brook to a quiet little pool where the water was not deep
At first he didnt like it at all The water got in his ears and up his
nose and choked him And then it was so dreadfully wet But he would
grit his teeth and keep at it After a while he got so that he could
paddle around a little Gradually he lost his fear of the water Then he
found that because he naturally moved so quickly he could sometimes
catch foolish minnows who swam in where the water was very shallow This
was great sport and he quite often had fish for dinner now
But he wasnt satisfied No Sir he wasnt satisfied Whatever Mr
Mink did he wanted to do well He could run well and climb well and
there was no better hunter in all the Green Forest He was bound that he
would swim well So he kept trying and trying He learned to fill his
lungs with air and hold his breath for a long time while he swam as
fast as ever he could with his head under water as he had seen his
cousin Mr Otter swim The more he did this the longer he could hold
his breath After a while he found that because he was slim and trim and
moved so fast he could outswim Mr Muskrat and this made him feel
very good indeed for Mr Muskrat spent nearly all his time in the water
and was accounted a very good swimmer There was only one thing that
bothered Mr Mink The water was so dreadfully wet Every time he came
out of it he had to run his hardest to dry off and keep from getting
cold This was very tiresome and he did wish that there was an easier
way of drying off
Then came the bad time the sad time when food was scarce and most of
the little people in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadow went
hungry But Mr Mink didnt go hungry Oh my no You see he had
learned to catch fish and so he had plenty to eat When Old Mother
Nature came to see how all the little people were getting along she was
very much surprised to find that Mr Mink had become a famous swimmer
She watched him catch a fish Then she watched him run about to dry off
and keep from getting cold and her eyes twinkled
He who helps himself deserves to be helped said Old Mother Nature
Mr Mink didnt know what she meant by that but the next morning he
found out Yes Sir the next morning he found out He found that he
had a brand new coat over his old one and the new one was waterproof
He could swim as much as he pleased and not get the least bit wet
because the water couldnt get through that new coat And ever since
that longago day when the world was young the Minks have had
waterproof coats and have been famous fishermen Hello Peter Rabbit
What under the sun are you trying to do swelling yourself up that way
II was just practising holding my breath replied Peter and looked
very very foolish
Ho ho ho Ha ha ha laughed Grandfather Frog You cant learn to
swim by holding your breath on dry land Peter Rabbit

HOW OLD MR TOAD LEARNED TO SING
III
HOW OLD MR TOAD LEARNED TO SING
Peter Rabbit never will forget how he laughed the first time he heard
Old Mr Toad say that he could sing and was going to sing Why Peter
would as soon think of singing himself and that is something he can no
more do than he can fly Peter had known Old Mr Toad ever since he
could remember He was rather fond of him even if he did play jokes on
him once in a while But he always thought of Old Mr Toad as one of the
homeliest of all his friendsslow awkward and too commonplace to be
very interesting So when in the glad joyousness of the spring Old
Mr Toad had told Jimmy Skunk that he was going down to the Smiling Pool
to sing because without him the great chorus there would lack one of its
sweetest voices Peter and Jimmy had laughed till the tears came
A few days later Peter happened over to the Smiling Pool for a call on
Grandfather Frog A mighty chorus of joy from unseen singers rose from
all about the Smiling Pool Peter knew about those singers They were
Hylas the little cousins of Stickytoes the Tree Toad Peter sat very
still on the edge of the bank trying to see one of them Suddenly he
became aware of a new note one he never had noticed before and sweeter
than any of the others Indeed it was one of the sweetest of all the
spring songs as sweet as the love notes of Tommy Tit the Chickadee
than which there is none sweeter
It seemed to come from the shallow water just in front of Peter and he
looked eagerly for the singer Then his eyes opened until it seemed as
if they would pop right out of his head and he dropped his lower jaw
foolishly There was Old Mr Toad with a queer bag Peter never had seen
before swelled out under his chin and as surely as Peter was sitting on
that bank it was Old Mr Toad who was the sweet singer
Old Mr Toad paid no attention to Peter not even when he was spoken to
He was so absorbed in his singing that he just didnt hear Peter sat
there a while to listen then he called Jimmy Skunk and Unc Billy
Possum who were also listening to the music and they were just as
surprised as Peter Then he spied Jerry Muskrat at the other end of the
Smiling Pool and hurried over there Peter was so full of the discovery
he had made that he could think of nothing else He fairly ached to
tell
Jerry he cried Oh Jerry Muskrat Do you know that Old Mr Toad can
sing
Jerry looked surprised that Peter should ask such a question Of course
I know it said he It would be mighty funny if I didnt know it
seeing that he is the sweetest singer in the Smiling Pool and has sung
here every spring since I can remember
Peter looked very much chagrined I didnt know it until just how he
confessed I didnt believe him when he told me that he could sing I
wonder how he ever learned
He didnt learn any more than you learned how to jump replied Jerry
It just came to him naturally His father sang and his grandfather
and his great grandfather way back to the beginning of things I
thought everybody knew about that
I dont Tell me about it Please do Jerry begged Peter
All right I will replied Jerry goodnaturedly Its something
you ought to know about anyway In the first place Old Mr Toad
belongs to a very old and honorable family one of the very oldest
Ive heard say that it goes way back almost to the very beginning of
things when there wasnt much land Anyway the first Toad the
greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of Old Mr Toad and own cousin to
the greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of Grandfather Frog was one
of the first to leave the water for the dry land
Old Mother Nature met him hopping along and making hard work of it
because of course it was so new She looked at him sharply What are
you doing here she demanded Arent you contented with the water
where you were born
Mr Toad bowed very low Yesm said he very humbly Ill go right
back there if you say so I thought there must be some things worth
finding out on the land and that I might be of some use in the Great
World
His answer pleased Old Mother Nature She was worried She had planted
all kinds of things on the land and they were springing up everywhere
but she had discovered that bugs of many kinds liked the tender green
things and were increasing so fast and were so greedy that they
threatened to strip the land of all that she had planted She had so
many things to attend to that she hadnt time to take care of the bugs
If you truly want to be of some use said she you can attend to some
of those bugs
Mr Toad went right to work and Old Mother Nature went about some
other business Having so many other things to look after she quite
forgot about Mr Toad and it was several weeks before she came that way
again Right in the middle of a great bare place where the bugs had
eaten everything was a beautiful green spot and patiently hopping from
plant to plant was Mr Toad snapping up every bug he could see He
didnt see Old Mother Nature and kept right on working She watched him
a while as he hopped from plant to plant catching bugs as fast as he
could and then she spoke
Have you stayed right here ever since I last saw you she asked
Mr Toad gave a start of surprise Yesm said he
But I thought you wanted to see the Great World and learn things
said she
Mr Toad looked a little embarrassed So I did he replied but I
wanted to be of some use and the bugs have kept me so busy there was no
time to travel Besides I have learned a great deal right here II
couldnt get around fast enough to save all the plants but I have
saved what I could
Old Mother Nature was more pleased than she was willing to show for
Mr Toad was the first of all the little people who had tried to help
her and he had done what he could willingly and faithfully
I suppose said she speaking a little gruffly you expect me to
reward you
Mr Toad looked surprised and a little hurt I dont want any reward
said he I didnt do it for that It will be reward enough to know that
I really have helped and to be allowed to continue to help
At that Old Mother Natures face lighted with one of her most beautiful
smiles Mr Toad said she if you could have just what you want
what would it be
Mr Toad hesitated a few minutes and then said shyly A beautiful
voice
It was Old Mother Natures turn to look surprised A beautiful voice
she exclaimed Pray why do you want a beautiful voice
So that I can express my happiness in the most beautiful way I know
ofby singing replied Mr Toad
You shall have it declared Old Mother Nature but not all the time
lest you be tempted to forget your work which you know is the real
source of true happiness In the spring of each year you shall go back
to your home in the water and there for a time you shall sing to your
hearts content and there shall be no sweeter voice than yours
Sure enough when the next spring came Mr Toad was filled with a
great longing to go home When he got there he found that in his throat
was a little music bag and when he swelled it out he had one of the
sweetest voices in the world And so it has been ever since with the
Toad family Old Mr Toad is one of the sweetest singers in the Smiling
Pool but when it is time to go back to work he never grumbles but is
one of the most faithful workers in Mother Natures garden concluded
Jerry Muskrat
Peter sighed I never could work said he Perhaps that is why I
cannot sing
Very likely replied Jerry Muskrat quite forgetting that he cannot
sing himself although he is a great worker

HOW OLD MR CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE
IV
HOW OLD MR CROW LOST HIS DOUBLE TONGUE
Caw caw caw caw Blacky the Crow sat in the top of a tall tree and
seemed trying to see just how much noise he could make with that harsh
voice of his Peter Rabbit peered out from the dear Old Briarpatch and
frowned
If I had a voice as unpleasant as that Id forget I could talk Yes
Sir Id forget I had a tongue declared Peter
Somebody laughed and Peter turned quickly to find Jimmy Skunk What
are you laughing at demanded Peter
At the idea of you forgetting that you had a tongue replied Jimmy
Well I would if I had a voice like Blackys persisted Peter
although he grinned a wee bit foolishly as he looked at Jimmy Skunk for
you know Peter is a great gossip
Its lucky for you that you havent then retorted Jimmy Im afraid
that you would lose your tongue just as old Mr Crow did
That sounded like a story Right away Peter sat up and took notice Did
old Mr Crow really lose his tongue How did he lose it Why did he lose
it When
Jimmy Skunk clapped a hand over each ear and pretended that he was going
to run away Peter jumped in front of him No you dont he cried
Youve just got to tell me that story Jimmy Skunk
What story asked Jimmy as if he hadnt the least idea in the world
what Peter was talking about though of course he knew perfectly well
Caw caw caw caw shouted Blacky the Crow from the distant treetop
The story of how old Mr Crow lost his tongue You may as well tell me
first as last because Ill give you no peace until you do insisted
Peter
Jimmy grinned If thats the case I guess Ill have to said he
Wait until I find a comfortable place to sit down I never could tell a
story standing up
At last he found a place to suit him and after changing his position two
or three times to make sure that he was perfectly comfortable he began
Once upon a time
Never mind about that interrupted Peter I dont see why all stories
have to begin Once upon a time It seems as if everything interesting
happened long ago
If you dont watch out this story wont begin at all declared Jimmy
Peter looked properly ashamed for interrupting and Jimmy started again
Once upon a time old Mr Crow the
greatgreateversogreatgrandfather of Blacky over there possessed
the most wonderful tongue of any of the little people who ran walked
crawled or flew He could imitate any and everybody and he did He
could sing like Mr Meadow Lark or he could bark like Mr Wolf He
could whistle like Mr Quail or he could growl like old King Bear
There wasnt anybody whose voice he couldnt imitate and do it so well
that if you had been there and heard but not seen him you never would
have guessed that it was an imitation
Now the imp of mischief was in old Mr Crow just as it is in Blacky
today and he was smart too There wasnt anybody smarter than old Mr
Crow Its from him that Blacky gets his smartness It didnt take him
long to discover that no one else had such a wonderful tongue It was
even more wonderful than the tongue of old Mr Mocker the Mocking Bird
Mr Mocker could imitate the songs of other birds but old Mr Crow
could imitate anybody as I have said He puzzled over it a good deal
himself for a while He couldnt understand how he could make any sound
he pleased while his neighbors could make only a few special sounds
Being very smart and shrewd just as Blacky is he finally made up his
mind that it must be in his tongue As soon as he thought of that he
started out to find out and on one excuse or another he managed to get
all his neighbors to show him their tongues Sure enough his own tongue
was different from any of the others It was split a little so that it
was almost like two tongues in one
Thats it he chuckled I knew it Its this little old tongue of
mine Nobody else has got one like it but nobody knows that but me I
must make good use of it Yes Sir I must make good use of it
Now when old Mr Crow said that he didnt really mean good use at all
That is he didnt mean what you or I or any of his neighbors would have
called good use What he did mean was the use that would bring to
himself the greatest gain in pleasure and being a great joker he began
by having a lot of fun with his neighbors When he saw Mr Rabbit your
grandfather a thousand times removed coming along he would hide and
just as Mr Rabbit was passing he would snarl like Mr Lynx Of course
Mr Rabbit would be scared almost to death and away he would go
lippertylippertylip and old Mr Crow would laugh so that he had to
hold his black sides He would hide in the top of a tree near Mr
Squirrels home and just when Mr Squirrel had found a fat nut and
started to eat it he would scream like Mr Hawk and then laugh to see
Mr Squirrel drop his nut and dive headfirst into the nearest hole He
would squeak like a mouse when Mr Fox was passing just to see Mr Fox
hunt and hunt for the dinner he felt sure was close at hand
But after a while Mr Crow wasnt satisfied with harmless jokes Times
were getting hard and everybody had to work to get enough to eat This
didnt suit Mr Crow at all and one day when he chanced to discover one
