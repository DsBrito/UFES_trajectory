CHAPTER I
Habit and Nervous Strain
PEOPLE form habits which cause nervous strain When these habits have
fixed themselves for long enough upon their victims the nerves give
way and severe depression or some other form of nervous prostration is
the result If such an illness turns the attention to its cause and so
starts the sufferer toward a radical change from habits which cause
nervous strain to habits which bring nervous strength then the illness
can be the beginning of better and permanent health If however there
simply is an enforced rest without any intelligent understanding of
the trouble the invalid gets well only to drag out a miserable
existence or to get very ill again
Although any nervous suffering is worth while if it is the means of
teaching us how to avoid nervous strain it certainly is far preferable
to avoid the strain without the extreme pain of a nervous breakdown
To point out many of these pernicious habits and to suggest a practical
remedy for each and all of them is the aim of this book and for that
reason common examples in various phases of everyday life are used as
illustrations
When there is no organic trouble there can be no doubt that defects of
character inherited or acquired are at the root of all nervous
illness If this can once be generally recognized and acknowledged
especially by the sufferers themselves we are in a fair way toward
eliminating such illness entirely
The trouble is people suffer from mortification and an unwillingness to
look their bad habits in the face They have not learned that
humiliation can be wholesome sound and healthy and so they keep
themselves in a mess of a fog because they will not face the shame
necessary to get out of it They would rather be ill and suffering and
believe themselves to have strong characters than to look the weakness
of their characters in the face own up to them like men and come out
into open fresh air with healthy nerves which will gain in strength as
they live
Any intelligent man or woman who thinks a bit for himself can see the
stupidity of this mistaken choice at a glance and seeing it will act
against it and thus do so much toward bringing light to all nervously
prostrated humanity
We can talk about faith cure Christian Science mind cure hypnotism
psychotherapeutics or any other forms of nerve cure which at the very
best can only give the man a gentle shunt toward the middle of the
stream of life Once assured of the truth the man must hold himself in
the clean wholesomeness of it by actively working for his own strength
of character from his own initiative There can be no other permanent
cure
I say that strength of character must grow from our own initiative and
I should add that it must be from our own initiative that we come to
recognize and actively believe that we are dependent upon a power not
our own and our real strength comes from ceasing to be an obstruction
to that power The work of not interfering with our best health moral
and physical means hard fighting and steady neverending vigilance
But it paysit more than pays And it seems to me this prevailing
trouble of nervous strain which is so much with us now can be the means
of guiding all men and women toward more solid health than has ever
been known before But we must work for it We must give up expecting
to be cured
CHAPTER II
How Women can keep from being Nervous
MANY people suffer unnecessarily from nerves just for the want of a
little knowledge of how to adjust themselves in order that the nerves
may get well As an example I have in mind a little woman who had been
ill for eight yearseight of what might have been the best years of
her lifeall because neither she nor her family knew the straight road
toward getting well Now that she has found the path she has gained
health wonderfully in six months and promises to be better than ever
before in her life
Let me tell you how she became ill and then I can explain her process
of getting well again One night she was overtired and could not get to
sleep and became very much annoyed at various noises that were about
the house Just after she had succeeded in stopping one noise she would
go back to bed and hear several others Finally she was so worked up
and nervously strained over the noises that her hearing became
exaggerated and she was troubled by noises that other people would not
have even heard so she managed to keep herself awake all night
The next day the strain of the overfatigue was of course very much
increased not only by the wakeful night but also by the annoyance
which had kept her awake The family were distressed that she should
not have slept all night talked a great deal about it and called in
the doctor
The womans strained nerves were on edge all day so that her feelings
were easily hurt and her brothers and sisters became as they thought
justly impatient at what they considered her silly babyishness This
of course roused her to more strain The overcare and the feeble
unintelligent sympathy that she had from some members of her family
kept her weak and selfcentered and the ignorant selfish impatience
with which the others treated her increased her nervous strain After
this there followed various other worries and a personal sense of
annoyanceall of which made her more nervous
Thenthe stomach and brain are so closely associatedher digestion
began to cause her discomfort a lump in her stomach her food would
not digest and various other symptoms all of which mean strained and
overwrought nerves although they are more often attributed merely to a
disordered stomach She worried as to what she had better eat and what
she had better not eat If her stomach was tired and some simple food
disagreed with her all the discomfort was attributed to the food
instead of to the real causea tired stomachand the cause back of
thatstrained nerves The consequence was that one kind of wholesome
food after another was cut off as being impossible for her to eat
Anything that this poor little invalid did not like about circumstances
or people she felt ugly and cried over Finally the entire family were
centered about her illness either in overcare or annoyance
You see she kept constantly repeating her brain impression of
overfatigue first annoyance because she stayed awake then annoyance
at noises then excited distress that she should have stayed awake all
night then resistance and anger at other people who interfered with
her Over and over that brain impression of nervous illness was
repeated by the woman herself and people about her until she seemed
settled into it for the rest of her life It was like expecting a sore
to get well while it was constantly being rubbed and irritated A woman
might have the healthiest blood in the world but if she cut herself
and then rubbed and irritated the cut and put salt in it it would be
impossible for it to heal
Now let me tell you how this little woman got well The first thing she
did was to take some very simple relaxing exercises while she was lying
in bed She raised her arms very slowly and as loosely as she could
from the elbow and then her hands from the wrist and stretched and
relaxed her fingers steadily then dropped her hand and forearm
heavily and felt it drop slowly at first then quickly and quietly
with its own weight She tried to shut her eyes like a baby going to
sleep and followed that with long gentle quiet breaths These and
other exercises gave her an impression of quiet relaxation so that she
became more sensitive to superfluous tension
When she felt annoyed at noises she easily noticed that in response to
the annoyance her whole body became tense and strained After she had
done her exercises and felt quiet and rested something would happen or
some one would say something that went against the grain and quick as
a wink all the good of the exercises would be gone and she would be
tight and strained again and nervously irritated
Very soon she saw clearly that she must learn to drop the habit of
physical strain if she wanted to get well but she also learned what
was morefar moreimportant than that that she must conquer the
cause of the strain or she could never permanently drop it She saw
that the cause was resentment and resistance to the noisesthe
circumstances the people and all the variety of things that had made
her nervous
Then she began her steady journey toward strong nerves and a wholesome
happy life She began the process of changing her brain impressions If
she heard noises that annoyed her she would use her will to direct her
attention toward dropping resistance to the noises and in order to
drop her mental resistance she gave her attention to loosening out the
bodily contractions Finally she became interested in the new process
as in a series of deep and true experiments Of course her living and
intelligent interest enabled her to gain very much faster for she not
only enjoyed her growing freedom but she also enjoyed seeing her
experiments work Nature always tends toward health and if we stop
interfering with her she will get us well
There is just this difference between the healing of a physical sore
and the healing of strained and irritated nerves With the one our
bodies are healed and things go on in them about the same as before
With the other every use of the will to free ourselves from the
irritation and its cause not only enables us to get free from the
nervous illness but in addition brings us new nerve vigor
When nervous illness is met deeply enough and in the normal way the
result is that the nerves become stronger than ever before
Often the effect of nervous strain in women is constant talking
Talktalktalk and mostly about themselves their ailments their
worries and the hindrances that are put in their way to prevent their
getting well This talking is not a relief as people sometimes feel
It is a direct waste of vigor But the waste would be greater if the
talk were repressed The only real help comes when the talker herself
recognizes the strain of her talk and loosens into silence
People must find themselves out to get wellreally wellfrom nervous
suffering The cause of nervous strain is so often in the character and
in the way we meet circumstances and people that it seems essential to
recognize our mistakes in that direction and to face them squarely
before we can do our part toward removing the causes of any nervous
illness
Remember it is not circumstances that keep us ill It is not people
that cause our illness It is not our environment that overcomes us It
is the way we face and deal with circumstances with people and with
environment that keeps our nerves irritated or keeps them quiet and
wholesome and steady
Let me tell the story of two men both of whom were brought low by
severe nervous breakdown One complained of his environment complained
of circumstances complained of people Everything and every one was
the cause of his suffering except himself The result was that he
weakened his brain by the constant willful and enforced strain so that
what little health he regained was the result of Natures steady and
powerful tendency toward health and in spite of the man himself
The other manto give a practical instancereturned from a journey
taken in order to regain the strength which he had lost from not
knowing how to work His business agent met him at the railroad station
with a piece of very bad news Instead of being frightened and
resisting and contracting in every nerve of his body he took it at
once as an opportunity to drop resistance He had learned to relax his
body and by doing relaxing and quieting exercises over and over he had
given himself a brain impression of quiet and let go which he could
recall at will Instead of expressing distress at the bad news he used
his will at once to drop resistance and relax and to the surprise of
his informant who had felt that he must break his bad news as easily
as possible he said Anything else Yes there was another piece of
news about as bad as the first Go on answered the man who had been
sick with nerves tell me something else
And so he did until he had told him five different things which were
about as disagreeable and painful to hear as could have been For every
bit of news our friend used his will with decision to drop the
resistance which would of course at once arise in response to all
that seemed to go against him
He had of course to work at intervals for long afterward to keep free
from the resistance but the habit is getting more and more established
as life goes on with him and the result is a brain clearer than ever
before in his life a power of nerve which is a surprise to every one
about him and a most successful business career
The success in business is however a minor matter His brain would
have cleared and his nerve strengthened just the same if what might be
called the business luck had continued to go against him as it seemed
to do for the first few months after his recovery That everything did
go against him for some time was the greatest blessing he could have
had The way he met all the reverses increased his nerve power steadily
and consistently
These two men are fair examples of two extremes The first one did not
know how to meet life If he had had the opportunity to learn he might
have done as well as the other The second had worked and studied to
help himself out of nerves and had found the true secret of doing it
Some men however and I regret to say more women have the weakening
habit so strong upon them that they are unwilling to learn how to get
well even when they have the opportunity It seems so strange to see
people suffer intenselyand be unwilling to face and follow the only
way that will lead them out of their torture
The trouble is we want our own way and nervous health too and with
those who have once broken down nervously the only chance of permanent
health is through learning to drop the strain of resistance when things
do not go their way This is proved over and over by the constant
relapse into nerves which comes to those who have simply been healed
over Even with those who appear to have been well for some time if
they have not acquired the habit of dropping their mental and physical
tension you can always detect an overcare for themselves which means
dormant fearor even active fear in the background
There are some wounds which the surgeons keep open even though the
process is most painful because they know that to heal really they
must heal from the inside Healing over on the outside only means decay
underneath and eventual death This is in most cases exactly
synonymous with the healing of brokendown nerves They must be healed
in causes to be permanently cured Sometimes the change that comes in
the process is so great that it is like reversing an engine
If the little woman whom I mentioned first had practiced relaxing and
quieting exercises every day for years and had not used the quiet
impression gained by the exercises to help her in dropping mental
resistances she never would have gained her health
Concentrating steadily on dropping the tension of the body is very
radically helpful in dropping resistance from the mind and the right
idea is to do the exercises over and over until the impression of quiet
openness is by constant repetition so strong with us that we can
recall it at will whenever we need it Finally after repeated tests
we gain the habit of meeting the difficulties of life without
strainfirst in little ways and then in larger ways
The most quieting relaxing and strengthening of all exercises for the
nerves comes in deep and rhythmic breathing and in voice exercises in
connection with it Nervous strain is more evident in a voice than in
any other expressive part of man or woman It sometimes seems as if all
other relaxing exercises were mainly useful because of opening a way
for us to breathe better There is a pressure on every part of the body
when we inhale and a consequent reaction when we exhale and the more
passive the body is when we take our deep breaths the more freely and
quietly the blood can circulate all the way through it and of course
all nervous and muscular contraction impairs circulation and all
impaired circulation emphasizes nervous contraction
To any one who is suffering from nerves in a lesser or greater
degree it could not fail to be of very great help to take half an hour
in the morning lie flat on the back with the body as loose and heavy
as it can be made and then study taking gentle quiet and rhythmic
breaths long and short Try to have the body so loose and open and
responsive that it will open as you inhale and relax as you exhale
just as a rubber bag would Of course it will take time but the
refreshing quiet is sure to come if the practice is repeated regularly
for a long enough time and eventually we would no more miss it than we
would go without our dinner
We must be careful after each deep long breath to rest quietly and let
our lungs do as they please Be careful to begin the breaths delicately
and gently to inhale with the same gentleness with which we begin and
to make the change from inhaling to exhaling with the greatest delicacy
possiblekeeping the body loose
For the shorter breaths we can count three or five or ten to inhale
and the same number to exhale until we have the rhythm established
and then go on breathing without counting as if we were sound asleep
Always aim for gentleness and delicacy If we have not half an hour to
spare to lie quietly and breathe we can practice the breathing while we
walk It is wonderful how we detect strain and resistance in our
breath and the restfulness which comes when we breathe so gently that
the breath seems to come and go without our volition brings new life
with it
We must expect to gain slowly and be patient we must remember that
nerves always get well by ups and downs and use our wills to make
every down lead to a higher up If we want the lasting benefit or any
real benefit at all when we get the brain impression of quiet freedom
from these breathing exercises we must insist upon recalling that
impression every time a test comes and face the circumstances or the
person or the duty with a voluntary insistence upon a quiet open
brain rather than a tense resistant one
It will come hard at first but we are sure to get there if we keep
steadily at it for it is really the Law of the Lord God Almighty that
we are learning to obey and this process of learning gives us steadily
an enlarged appreciation of what trust in the Lord really is There is
no trust without obedience and an intelligent obedience begets trust
The nerves touch the soul on one side and the body on the other and we
must work for freedom of soul and body in response to spiritual and
physical law if we want to get sick nerves well If we do not remember
always a childlike attitude toward the Lord the best nerve training is
only an easy way of being selfish
To sum it all upif you want to learn to help yourself out of nerves
learn to rest when you rest and to work without strain when you work
learn to loosen out of the muscular contractions which the nerves
cause learn to drop the mental resistances which cause the nerves
and which take the form of anger resentment worry anxiety
impatience annoyance or selfpity eat only nourishing food eat it
slowly and chew it well breathe the freshest air you can and breathe
it deeply gently and rhythmically take what healthy vigorous
exercise you find possible do your daily work to the best of your
ability give your attention so entirely to the process of gaining
health for the sake of your work and other people that you have no mind
left with which to complain of being ill and see that all this effort
aims toward a more intelligent obedience to and trustfulness in the
Power that gives us life Wholesome sustained concentration is in the
very essence of healthy nerves
CHAPTER III
You Have no Idea how I am Rushed
A WOMAN can feel rushed when she is sitting perfectly still and has
really nothing whatever to do A woman can feel at leisure when she is
working diligently at something with a hundred other things waiting to
be done when the time comes It is not all we have to do that gives us
the rushed feeling it is the way we do what is before us It is the
attitude we take toward our work
Now this rushed feeling in the brain and nerves is intensely
oppressive Many women and men too suffer from it keenly and they
suffer the more because they do not recognize that that feeling of rush
is really entirely distinct from what they have to do in truth it has
nothing whatever to do with it
I have seen a woman suffer painfully with the sense of being pushed for
time when she had only two things to do in the whole day and those two
things at most need not take more than an hour each This same woman
was always crying for rest I never knew before I saw her that women
could get just as abnormal in their efforts to rest as in their
insistence upon overwork This little lady never rested when she went
to rest she would lie on the bed for hours in a state of strain about
resting that was enough to tire any ordinarily healthy woman One
friend used to tell her that she was an inebriate on resting It is
perhaps needless to say that she was a nervous invalid and in the
process of gaining her health she had to be set to work and kept at
work Many and many a time she has cried and begged for rest when it
was not rest she needed at all it was work
She has started off to some good healthy work crying and sobbing at
the cruelty that made her go and has returned from the work as happy
and healthy apparently as a little child Then she could go to rest
and rest to some purpose She had been busy in wholesome action and the
normal reaction came in her rest As she grew more naturally interested
in her work she rested less and less and she rested better and better
because she had something to rest from and something to rest for
Now she does only a normal amount of resting but gets new life from
every moment of rest she takes before all her rest only made her want
more rest and kept her always in the strain of fatigue And what might
seem to many a very curious result is that as the abnormal desire for
rest disappeared the rushed feeling disappeared too
There is no one thing that American women need more than a healthy
habit of rest but it has got to be real rest not strained nor
selfindulgent rest
Another example of this effort at rest which is a sham and a strain is
the woman who insists upon taking a certain time every day in which to
rest She insists upon doing everything quietly and withas she
thinksa sense of leisure and yet she keeps the whole household in a
sense of turmoil and does not know it She sits complacently in her
pose of prompt action quietness and rest and has a tornado all about
her She is so deluded in her own idea of herself that she does not
observe the tornado and yet she has caused it Everybody in her
household is tired out with her demands and she herself is ill
chronically ill But she thinks she is at peace and she is annoyed
that others should be tired
If this woman could open and let out her own interior tornado which
she has kept frozen in there by her false attitude of restful quiet
she would be more ill for a time but it might open her eyes to the
true state of things and enable her to rest to some purpose and to
allow her household to rest too
It seems at first thought strange that in this country when the
right habit of rest is so greatly needed that the strain of rest
should have become in late years one of the greatest defects On second
thought however we see that it is a perfectly rational result We
have strained to work and strained to play and strained to live for so
long that when the need for rest gets so imperative that we feel we
must rest the habit of strain is so upon us that we strain to rest And
what does such rest amount to What strength does it bring us What
enlightenment do we get from it
With the little lady of whom I first spoke rest was a
steadilyweakening process She was resting her body straight toward
its grave When a body rests and rests the circulation gets more and
more sluggish until it breeds disease in the weakest organ and then
the physicians seem inclined to give their attention to the disease
and not to the cause of the abnormal strain which was behind the
disease Again as we have seen the abnormal rushed feeling can exist
just as painfully with too much and the wrong kind of rest as with too
much work and the wrong way of working
We have been as a nation inclined toward Americanitis for so long
now that children and childrens children have inherited a sense of
rush and they suffer intensely from it with a perfectly clear
understanding of the fact that they have nothing whatever to hurry
about This is quite as true of men as it is of women In such cases
the first care should be not to fasten this sense of rush on to
anything the second care should be to go to work to cure it to relax
out of that contractionjust as you would work to cure twitching St
Vituss dance or any other nervous habit
Many women will get up and dress in the morning as if they had to catch
a train and they will come in to breakfast as if it were a steamer for
the other side of the world that they had to get and no other steamer
went for six months They do not know that they are in a rush and a
hurry and they do not find it out until the strain has been on them
for so long that they get nervously ill from itand then they find
themselves suffering from that rushed feeling
Watch some women in an argument pushing actually rushing to prove
themselves right they will hardly let their opponent have an
opportunity to speak much less will they stop to consider what he says
and see if by chance he may not be right and they wrong
The rushing habit is not by any means in the fact of doing many things
It asserts itself in our brains in talking in writing in thinking
How many of us I wonder have what might be called a quiet working
brain Most of us do not even know the standard of a brain that thinks
and talks and lives quietly a brain that never pushes and never
rushes or if by any chance it is led into pushing or rushing is so
wholesomely sensitive that it drops the push or the rush as a bare hand
would drop a redhot coal
None of us can appreciate the weakening power of this strained habit of
rush until we have by the use of our own wills directed our minds
toward finding a normal habit of quiet and yet I do not in the least
exaggerate when I say that its weakening effect on the brain and nerves
is frightful
And again I repeat the rushed feeling has nothing whatever to do with
the work before us A woman can feel quite as rushed when she has
nothing to do as when she is extremely busy
But some one says may I not feel pressed for time when I have more
to do than I can possibly put into the time before me
Oh yes yesyou can feel normally pressed for time and because of
this pressure you can arrange in your mind what best to leave undone
and so relieve the pressure If one thing seems as important to do as
another you can make up your mind that of course you can only do what
you have time for and the remainder must go You cannot do what you
have time to do so well if you are worrying about what you have no time
for There need be no abnormal sense of rush about it
Just as Nature tends toward health Nature tends toward resttoward
the right kind of rest and if we have lost the true knack of resting
we can just as surely find it as a sunflower can find the sun It is
not something artificial that we are trying to learnit is something
natural and alive something that belongs to us and our own best
instinct will come to our aid in finding it if we will only first turn
our attention toward finding our own best instinct
We must have something to rest from and we must have something to rest
for if we want to find the real power of rest Then we must learn to
let go of our nerves and our muscles to leave everything in our bodies
open and passive so that our circulation can have its own best way But
we must have had some activity in order to have given our circulation a
fair start before we can expect it to do its best when we are passive
Then what is most important we must learn to drop all effort of our
minds if we want to know how to rest and that is difficult We can do
it best by keeping our minds concentrated on something simple and quiet
and wholesome For instance you feel tired and rushed and you can have
half an hour in which to rest and get rid of the rush Suppose you lie
down on the bed and imagine yourself a turbulent lake after a storm
The storm is dying down dying down until by and by there is no wind
only little dashing waves that the wind has left Then the waves quiet
down steadily more and more until finally they are only ripples on
the water Then no ripples but the water is as still as glass The sun
goes down The sky glows Twilight comes One star appears and green
banks and trees and sky and stars are all reflected in the quiet mirror
of the lake and you are the lake and you are quiet and refreshed and
rested and ready to get up and go on with your workto go on with it
too better and more quietly than when you left it
Or another way to quiet your mind and to let your imagination help you
to a better rest is to float on the top of a turbulent sea and then to
sink down down down until you get into the still water at the bottom
of the sea We all know that no matter how furious the sea is on the
surface not far below the surface it is absolutely still It is very
restful to go down there in imagination
Whatever choice we may make to quiet our minds and our bodies as soon
as we begin to concentrate we must not be surprised if intruding
thoughts are at first constantly crowding to get in We must simply let
them come Let them come and pay no attention to them
I knew of a woman who was nervously ill and some organs of her body
were weakened very much by the illness She madeup her mind to rest
herself well and she did so Every day she would rest for three hours
she said to herself I will rest an hour on my left side an hour on
my right side and an hour on my back And she did that for days and
days When she lay on one side she had a very attractive tree to look
at When she lay on the other she had an interesting picture before
her When she lay on her back she had the sky and several trees to see
through a window in front of the bed She grew steadily better every
weekshe had something to rest for She was resting to get well If
she had rested and complained of her illness I doubt if she would have
been well today She simply refused to take the unpleasant sensations
into consideration except for the sake of resting out of them When she
was well enough to take a little active exercise she knew she could
rest better and get well faster for that and she insisted upon taking
the exercise although at first she had to do it with the greatest
care Now that this woman is well she knows how to rest and she knows
how to work better than ever before
For normal rest we need the long sleep of night For shorter rests
which we may take during the day often opportunity comes at most
unexpected times and in most unexpected ways and we must be ready to
take advantage of it We need also the habit of working restfully This
habit of course enables us to rest truly when we are only resting and
again the habit of resting normally helps us to work normally
A wise old lady said My dear you cannot exaggerate the unimportance
of things She expressed even more perhaps than she knew
It is our habit of exaggerating the importance of things that keeps us
hurried and rushed It is our habit of exaggerating the importance of
ourselves that makes us hold the strain of life so intensely If we
