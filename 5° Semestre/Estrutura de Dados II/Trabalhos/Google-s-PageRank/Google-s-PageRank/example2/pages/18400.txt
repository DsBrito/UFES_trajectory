jaundice Borrow asked the Doctor or is it merely dirt  While at
Norwich too he was greatly influenced in the direction of linguistics
by the English pocket Goethe William Taylor the head of a clan known
as the Taylors of Norwich to distinguish them from a race in which the
principle of heredity was even more strikingly developedthe Taylors of
Ongar  In February 1824 his father the gallant Captain Thomas Borrow
died and his articles in the firm of a Norwich solicitor having
determined George went to London to commence literary man in the old
sense of the servitude under the wellknown booksellerpublisher Sir
Richard Phillipps  In Grub Street he translated and compiled galore but
when the trees began to shoot in 1825 he broke his chain and escaped to
the country to the dingle and to Isopel Berners
To dwell upon the bare outlines of Borrows early career would be a
superfluously dull proceeding  We shall only add a few names and dates
to the framework supplied with a fidelity that is rare in much more
formal works of autobiography in the pages of Lavengro  From the same
pages we may detach just a few of the earlier influences which went to
make up the rare and complex individuality of the writer  Borrows
father a fine old soldier in revealing his sons youthful idiosyncrasy
projects a clear mental image of his own habit of mind  The boy had the
impertinence to say the classics were much overvalued and amongst other
things that some horrid fellow or other some Welshman I think thank
God it was not an Irishman was a better poet than Ovid 2  That a boy
of his years should entertain an opinion of his own I mean one which
militates against all established authority is astonishing  As well
might a raw recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion on the
manual and platoon exercise  The idea is preposterous the lad is too
independent by half
Borrows account of his fathers death is a highly affecting piece of
English  The ironical humour blent with pathos in his picture of this
illrewarded old disciplinarian who combined a tenderness of heart with
a fondness for military metaphor that frequently reminds one of My Uncle
Toby the details of the ailments and the portents that attended his
infantile career and above all the glimpses of the wandering military
life from barrack to barrack and from garrison to garrison inevitably
remind the reader of the childish reminiscences of Laurence Sterne a
writer to whom it may thus early be said that George Borrow paid no small
amount of unconscious homage  A homage of another sort fully recognised
and declared was that paid to the great work of Defoe and to the spirit
of strange and romantic enterprise which it aroused in its reader
After Robinson Crusoe there played across the disk of his youthful
memory a number of weird and hairy figures never to be effaced  A
strange old herbalist and snakekiller with a skin cap first whetted his
appetite for the captivating confidences of roadside vagrants and the
acquaintanceship serves as an introduction to the scene of the gipsy
encampment where the young Sapengro or serpent charmer was first claimed
as brother by Jasper Petulengro  The picture of the encampment may serve
as an example of Borrovian prose nervous unembarrassed and graphic
One day it happened being on my rambles I entered a green lane which
I had never seen before  At first it was rather narrow but as I
advanced it became considerably wider  In the middle was a driftway
with deep ruts but right and left was a space carpeted with a sward
of trefoil and clover  There was no lack of trees chiefly ancient
oaks which flinging out their arms from either side nearly formed a
canopy and afforded a pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun which
was burning fiercely above  Suddenly a group of objects attracted my
attention  Beneath one of the largest of the trees upon the grass
was a kind of low tent or booth from the top of which a thin smoke
was curling  Beside it stood a couple of light carts whilst two or
three lean horses or ponies were cropping the herbage which was
growing nigh
As a pendant to the landscape take a Flemish interior  The home of the
Borrows had been removed in the meantime in accordance with the roving
traditions of the family from Norman Cross to Edinburgh and from
Edinburgh to Clonmel
And to the school I went at Clonmel where I read the Latin tongue
and the Greek letters with a nice old clergyman who sat behind a black
oaken desk with a huge Elzevir Flaccus before him in a long gloomy
kind of hall with a broken stone floor the roof festooned with
cobwebs the walls considerably dilapidated and covered over with
stray figures in hieroglyphics evidently produced by the application
of a burnt stick
In Ireland too he made the acquaintance of the gossoon Murtagh who
taught him Irish in return for a pack of cards  In the course of his
wanderings with his fathers regiment he develops into a wellgrown and
wellfavoured lad a shrewd walker and a bold rider  People may talk of
first loveit is a very agreeable event I dare saybut give me the
flush the triumph and glorious sweat of a first ride 5
At Norwich he learns modern languages from an old emigre a true
disciple of the ancien cour who sets Boileau high above Dante and
some misty German metaphysics from the Norwich philosopher who
consistently seeks a solace in smoke from the troubles of life  His
father had already noted his tendency to fly off at a tangent which was
strikingly exhibited in the lawyers office where within the womb of a
lofty deal desk when he should have been imbibing Blackstone and
transcribing legal documents he was studying Monsieur Vidocq and
translating the Welsh bard Ab Gwilym he was consigning his legal career
to an early grave when he wrote this elegy on the worthy attorney his
master
He has long since sunk to his place in a respectable vault in the
aisle of a very respectable church whilst an exceedingly respectable
marble slab against the neighbouring wall tells on a Sunday some eye
wandering from its prayerbook that his dust lies below  To secure
such respectabilities in death he passed a most respectable life a
more respectablelooking individual never was seen
In the meantime as a sequel to his questionings on the subjects of
reality and truth the Author was asking himself What is death and the
query serves as a prelude to the first of the many breezy dialogues with
that gipsy cousingerman to Autolycus Jasper Petulengro
What is your opinion of death Mr Petulengro
My opinion of death brother is much the same as that in the old
song of Pharaoh    when a man dies he is cast into the earth and
his wife and child sorrow over him  If he has neither wife nor child
then his father and mother I suppose and if he is quite alone in the
world why then he is cast into the earth and there is an end of the
matter
And do you think that is the end of man
Theres an end of him brother mores the pity
Why do you say so
Life is sweet brother
Do you think so
Think so theres night and day brother both sweet things sun
moon and stars brother all sweet things theres likewise a wind on
the heath  Life is very sweet brother who would wish to die
I would wish to die
You talk like a gorgiowhich is the same as talking like a fool
were you a Romany chal you would talk wiser  Wish to die indeed a
Romany chal would wish to live for ever
In sickness Jasper
Theres the sun and stars brother
In blindness Jasper
Theres the wind on the heath brother if I could only feel that I
would gladly live for ever  Daeta well now go to the tents and put
on the gloves and Ill try to make you feel what a sweet thing it is
to be alive brother
Leaving Norwich and his legal trammels a few weeks after his fathers
death in 1824 Lavengro reaches Londonthe scene of Grub Street
struggles not greatly relaxed in severity since the days of Newbery
Gardener and Christopher Smart  As the genius of Hawthorne was cooped up
and enslaved for the American Peter Parley so that of Borrow was hag
ridden by a bookseller publisher of an even worse type the radical
alderman and philanthropic sweater Sir Richard Phillipps  For this
stonyhearted faddist he covered reams of paper with printers copy and
we are told that the kind of compilation that he liked and probably
executed best was that of Newgate Lives and Trials  He had wellnigh
reached the end of his tether when he had the conversation with
Phillippss head factotum Taggart which we cite below and recommend
feelingly to the consideration of every literary aspirant  Sordid and
commonplace enough are the details simple and free from every kind of
inflation the language in which they are narrated  Yet how picturesque
are these vignettes of London life  How vivid and yet how strange are
the figures that animate them  The harsh literary impresario with his
drug in the market who seems to have stalked straight out of Smollett
8 the gnarled old applewoman with every wrinkle shown on her stall
upon London Bridge the grasping Armenian merchant who softened at the
sound of his native tongue the giddy young spendthrift Francis Ardry and
the confiding young creature who had permitted him to hire her a very
handsome floor in the West End the gipsies and thimbleriggers in
Greenwich Parkwhat moving and lifelike figures are these stippled in
with a seeming absence of art yet as strange and as rare as a Night in
Bagdad a chapter of Balzac or the most fantastic scene in the New
Arabian Nights
This brief recapitulationin which it has been possible but just to
touch upon a few of the inner springs of Borrows life as revealed in the
autobiographical Lavengrobrings us once again to that spring day in
1825May 20thwhen the author disposed of an unidentifiable manuscript
for the sumptuous equivalent of 20 pounds  On May 22nd after little
more than a years residence in London he abandons the city  From
London he proceeds to Amesbury in Wiltshire which he reaches on May
23rd visits Stonehenge the Roman Camp of Old Sarum and Salisbury on
May 26th he leaves Salisbury and after an encounter with the longlost
son of the old applewoman returned from Botany Bay strikes northwest
On the 30th he has been walking four days in a northerly direction when
he arrives at the inn where the maid Jenny refreshes him at the pump and
he meets the author with whom he passes the night  On the 31st he
purchases the horse and cart of Jack Slingsby whom he had previously
seen but once at Tamworth many years ago when he was little more than a
child  On June 1st he makes the first practical experience of a
vagrants life and passes the night in the open air in a Shropshire
dell on June 5th he is visited by Leonora Herne the grandchild of the
old brimstone hag who was jealous of the cordiality with which the
young stranger had been received by the Petulengroes and initiated in the
secrets of their gipsy tribe  Three days later betrayed to the old
woman by Leonora he is drabbed ie poisoned with the manricli or
doctored cake of Mrs Herne his life is in imminent danger but he is
saved by the opportune arrival of Peter Williams  He passes Sunday June
12th with the Welsh preacher and his wife Winifred on the 21st he
departs with his itinerant hosts to the Welsh border  Before entering
Wales however he turns back with Ambrose Jasper Petulengro and
settles with his own stockintrade as tinker and blacksmith at the foot
of the dingle hard by Mumpers Lane near Willenhall in Staffordshire
here at the end of June 1825 takes place the classical encounter between
the philologer and the flaming tinmanall this is it not related in
Lavengro and substantiated with much hard labour of facts and dates by
Dr W I Knapp in his exhaustive biography of George Borrow  The
allurement of his genius is such that the etymologist shall leave his
roots and the philologer his MaesoGothic to take to the highway and
dwell in the dingle with Don Jorge
Lavengros triumph over the flaming tinman is the prelude to what
Professor Saintsbury justly calls the miraculous episode of Ysopel
Berners and the narrative of the authors life is thence continued
with many digressions but with a remarkable fidelity to fact as far as
the main issue is concerned until the narrative though not the life
story of the author abruptly terminates at Horncastle in August 1825
There follows what is spoken of as the veiled period of Borrows life
from 1826 to 1833
The years in which we drift are generally veiled from posterity  The
system of psychometry carried to such perfection by Obermann and Amiel
could at no time have been exactly congenial to Borrow who spoke of
himself at this period as digging holes in the sand and filling them up
again  Roughly speaking the years appear to have been spent
comparatively uneventfully for the most part in Norfolk  In December
1832 he walked to London to interview the British and Foreign Bible
Society covering a hundred and twelve miles in twentyseven hours on
less than sixpennyworth of food and drink  He was thirty years old at
the time and the achievement was the pride of his remaining years  Six
months later on the strength of his linguistic attainments he managed
to get on the paid staff of the Society to the bewilderment of Norwich
friends who were inclined to be ironical on the subject of the
transformation of the chum of hanged Thurtell and the disciple of godless
Billy Taylor into a Bible missionary  In July 1833 then Borrow sets
out on his Eastern travels as the accredited agent of the Bible Society
goes to St Petersburg the finest city in the world and obtains the
Russian imprimatur for a Manchu version of that suspicious novelty the
Bible  He carried this scheme into execution to the general
satisfaction and he returns to London in 1837 then to the south of
Europe whence he reappears larger than life and twice as natural in
his masterly autobiographical romance of The Bible in Spain the work
which made his name which was sold by thousands which was eagerly
acclaimed as an invaluable addition to Sunday literature and pirated
in a generous spirit of emulation by American publishers
We are now come to the circumstance of the composition of Lavengro
The Bible in Spain when it appeared in 1843 implied a wonderful
background to the Authors experience a career diversified by all kinds
of wild adventures sorcery Jews Gentiles rambles gipsies
prisonswhat you will 12
The personal element in the bookso suggestive of mystery and
romanceexcited the strongest curiosity  Apart from this however the
reading public of 1843 were not unnaturally startled by a book which
seemed to profess to be a good serious missionary work but for which
it was manifest that Gil Blas and not Bishop Heber had been taken as a
model  Not that any single comparison of the kind can convey the least
idea of the complex idiosyncrasy of such a work  There is a substratum
of Guide Book and Gil Blas no doubt but there are unmistakable
streaks of Defoe of Dumas and of Dickens with all his native
prejudices and insular predilections strong upon him  A narrative so
wide awake amidst a vagrant population of questionable morals and alien
race suggests an affinity with Hajji Baba a close kinsman we
conceive of the Borrovian picaro  But above all as one follows the
author through the mazes of his book one is conscious of two strangely
assorted figures never far from the itinerants side and always ready
to improve the occasion if a shadow of an opportunity be afforded  One
who is prolific of philological chippings might be compared to a
semblance of Max Muller while the other alternately denouncing the
wickedness and deriding the toothlessness of a grim Giant Pope may be
likened at a distance to John Bunyan  About the wholeto concludeis
an atmosphere not too pronounced of the Newgate Calendar and a few
patches of sawdust from the Prize Ring  May not people well have
wondered the good pious English folk to whom Luck is a scandal as the
Bible Societys secretary wrote to Borrowwhat manner of man is this
this muleteermissionary this natural man with a pen in the hand of a
prizefighter but of a prizefighter who is afflicted with the fads of a
philologerand a pedant at that  The surprise may be compared to what
that of a previous generation would have been had it seen Johnson and
Boswell and Baretti all fused into one man  The incongruity is
heightened by familiarity with Borrows tall blonde Scandinavian
figure and the reader is reminded of those roving Northmen of the days
of simple mediaeval devotion who were wont to signalise their conversion
from heathen darkness by a Mediterranean venture combining the
characters of a piratical cruise and a pious pilgrimage
That Curiosity exaggerated and was a marvelmonger we shall attempt to
demonstrate  But in the meantime it was there and it was very strong
As for Borrow he was prepared to derive stimulus from it just as long as
it maintained the unquestioning attitude of Jasper Petulengro when he
expressed the sentiments of gipsydom in the wellworn Lor brother how
learned you are
In February 1843 Borrow wrote to Murray that he had begun his Lifea
kind of biography in the Robinson Crusoe styleand was determined
that it should surpass anything that he had already written  It had been
contemplated he added for some months already as a possible sequel to
the Bible in Spain if that proved successful  Hitherto he wrote the
public had said Good to his Gypsies of Spain 1841 Better to
the Bible in Spain and he wanted it when No 3 appeared to say
Best  Five years rapidly passed away until in the summer of 1848
the book was announced as about to appear shortly under the title of
Lavengro An Autobiography which was soon changed to Life a Drama
The difficulty of writing a book which should have no humbug in it
proved as may well be supposed immense and would in any case be quite
sufficient to account for the long period of gestation  His perplexities
may have often been very near akin to those ascribed to the superstitious
author in the sixtyfifth chapter of Lavengro his desire to be
original sadly cramping the powers of his mind his fastidiousness being
so great that he invariably rejected whatever ideas he did not consider
to be legitimately his own  As a substitute for the usual padding of
humbug sycophancy and secondhand ideas he bethought himself of
philology and he set himself to spring fragments of philological
instruction often far from sound upon his reader in the most unexpected
places that his ingenuity could devise  He then began to base hopes
upon the book in proportion to its originality  At the last moment
however the Author grew querulous about his work distrustful of the
reception that would be given to it and even as to the advisability of
producing it at all  Much yet remained to be done but for a long time
he refused not only to forward new copy to Albemarle Street but even to
revise the proofs of that which he had already written and it required
all the dunning that Murray and the printer Woodfall dare apply before
Lavengro with its altered subtitle for at the last moment Borrow grew
afraid of openly avowing his identity with the speaking likeness which he
had created could be announced as just ready in the Athenaeum of
Dec 14th 1850
Lavengro the Scholar the Gypsy the Priest eventually appeared
in three volumes on Feb 7th 1851  The autobiographical Lavengro
stopped short in July 1825 at the conclusion of the hundredth chapter
with an abruptness worthy of the Sentimental Journey  The Author had
succeeded in extending the area of mystery but not in satisfying the
public  Borrows confidences were so very different in complexion from
those which the critics seemed to have expected that they were taken
aback and declared to the public almost with one accord that the writers
eccentricities had developed into mannerisms that his theories of life
were political manifestoes that his dialects were gibberish and his
defiance of the orthodox canons of autobiography scarcely less than an
outrage upon the public taste
From the general public came a fusillade of requests to solve the
prevailing mystery of the book  Was it fact or fictionor if fact and
fiction were blended in what proportions  Borrow ought to have been
prepared for a question so natural in the mouths of literary busybodies
at any time and especially at a time when partisan spirit was rampant
and the vitality of the lampoon as a factor in politics so far from
extinct  To show his contempt alike for the critical verdict and the
popular curiosity after a quarrel or at least a sharp coolness with
John Murray he published in two volumes in May 1857 The Romany Rye
which carries on the story of Lavengro for just about a month further
namely down towards the end of August 1825 and there again stops dead
Whether we regard coherence or the rate of progress no more attempt at
amendment is perceptible than can be discerned in the later as compared
with the earlier volumes of Tristram Shandy  The peculiarities of the
earlier volume are indeed here accentuated while the Author had
evidently only been confirmed by the lapse of years in the political
philosophy to which he had already given expression  At the end was
printed an appendix a sort of catalogue raisonne of Borrovian
prejudices satirising with unmeasured bitterness the critics of
Lavengro
The resumption of a story after an interval of over six years with
appendages so extravagant whether we regard their tenor or their length
and with an indifference so sublime to the popular desire that he should
get along with his personal narrative was hardly calculated to
conciliate critical opinion but it had one capital effect  It drew from
Whitwell Elwin himself a Norfolk man and a literary critic of the
widest grasp and knowledge this remarkable testimony that far from
exaggerating such incidents as were drawn from his own experience not a
few as he himself could verify Borrows descriptions were rather
within the truth than beyond it  However picturesquely they may be
drawn the lines are invariably those of nature     There can be no
doubt that the larger part and possibly the whole of the work is a
narrative of actual occurrences
Here then is the heart of the mystery or of the mystery that is
apparent the phenomenon is due primarily to the fact that Borrows book
is so abnormally true as regards the matter while in manner of
presentation it is so strikingly original  There are superficial traces
no doubt of not a few writers of the eighteenth century  In some of his
effects Borrow reproduces Sterne essentially Sternean for instance is
the interview between the youthful author and the experienced Mr
Taggart
Well young gentleman said Taggart to me one morning when we
chanced to be alone a few days after the affair of cancelling how
do you like authorship
I scarcely call authorship the drudgery I am engaged in said I
What do you call authorship said Taggart
I scarcely know said I that is I can scarcely express what I
think it
Shall I help you out said Taggart turning round his chair and
looking at me
If you like said I
To write something grand said Taggart taking snuff to be stared
atlifted on peoples shoulders
Well said I that is something like it
Taggart took snuff
Well said he why dont you write something grand
I have said I
What said Taggart
Why said I there are those ballads
Taggart took snuff
And those wonderful versions from Ab Gwilym
Taggart took snuff again
You seem to be very fond of snuff said I looking at him angrily
Taggart tapped his box
Have you taken it long
Threeandtwenty years
What snuff do you take
Universal Mixture
And you find it of use
Taggart tapped his box
In what respect said I
In manythere is nothing like it to get a man through but for snuff
I should scarcely be where I am now
Have you been long here
Threeandtwenty years
Dear me said I and snuff brought you through  Give me a
pinchpah I dont like it and I sneezed
Take another pinch said Taggart
No said I I dont like snuff
Then you will never do for authorship at least for this kind
So I begin to think  What shall I do
Taggart took snuff
You were talking of a great work  What shall it be
Taggart took snuff
Do you think I could write one
Taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap he did not
however
It would require time said I with half a sigh
Taggart tapped his box
A great deal of time  I really think that my ballads
Taggart took snuff
If published would do me credit  Ill make an effort and offer
them to some other publisher
Taggart took a double quantity of snuff
Equally Sternelike is the conclusion to a chapter Italywhat was I
going to say about Italy
Less superficial is the influence of Cervantes and his successors of the
Picaresque school down to the last and most representative of them in
England namely Defoe and Smollett  Profoundest of all perhaps is the
influence of Defoe of whose powers of intense realisation exhibited in
the best parts of Robinson Crusoe we get a fine counterpart amid the
outcasts in Mumpers Lane  Bound up with the truthfulness and
originality of the Author is that strange absence of sycophancy which we
may flatter ourselves is no exceptional thing but which is in reality a
very rare phenomenon in literature
Apart from this independence of character which he so justly prized and
a monomania or two such as his devotion to philology or detestation of
popery Borrows mental peculiarities are not by any means so extravagant
as has been supposed  His tastes were for the most part not unusual
though they might be assorted in a somewhat uncommon manner  He was a
thorough sportsman in the best sense but he combined with his sporting
zeal an instinctive hatred of gambling of bad language and of tyranny
or cruelty in any form  He entertained a love for the horse in the
stable without bowing down to worship the stagecoachmen the jockeys
and other ignoble heroes of horsey life  He loved his country and the
quiet unpretending Church of England  He was ready to exalt the
obsolescent fisticuffs and the strong ale of Old England but he was
not blind either to the drunkenness or to the overbearing brutality which
he had reason to fear might be held to disfigure the character of the
swilling and prizefighting sections among his compatriots 20a
Borrow was a master of whim but it is easy to exaggerate his
eccentricity  As a traveller who met with adventures upon the roads of
Britain he was surpassed by a dozen writers that could be named and in
our own dayto mention oneby that truly eccentric being The Druid
20b  The Druid had a special affinity with Borrow in regard to his
kindness for an old applewoman  His applewoman kept a stall in the
Strand to which the Druid was a constant visitor mainly for the purpose
of having a chat and borrowing and repaying small sums rarely exceeding
one shilling  As an author again Borrow was as jealous as one of
Thackerays heroines he could hardly bear to hear a contemporary book
praised  Whim if you will but scarcely an example of literary
eccentricity
Borrow developed a delightful faculty for adventure upon the high road
but such a faculty was far less singular than his giftakin to the
greatest painters power of suggesting atmosphereof investing each
scene and incident with a separate and distinct air of uncompromising
reality  Many persons may have had the advantage of hearing conversation
as brilliant or as wise as that of the dinner at Dillys what is
distinctive of genius is the power to convey the general feeling of the
interlocutors to suggest a dramatic effect an artistic whole as
Boswell does by the cumulative effect of infinitesimal factors  The
triumph in each case is one not of opportunities but of the subtlest
literary sense
Similarly Borrows fixed ideas had little that was really exceptional or
peculiar about them  His hatred of mumbojumbo and priestcraft was but a
part of his steady love of freedom and sincerity  His linguistic mania
had less of a philological basis than he would have us believe
Impatience that Babel should act as a barrier between kindred souls an
insatiable curiosity prompted by the knowledge that the language of
minorities was in nine cases out of ten the direct route to the heart of
the secret of folks that puzzled himsuch were the motives that
stimulated a hunger for strange vocabularies not in itself abnormal  The
colloquial faculty which he undoubtedly possessedfor we are told by
Taylor that when barely eighteen he already knew English Welsh Irish
Latin Greek Hebrew German Danish French Italian and
Portugueserarely goes with philological depth any more than with
idiomatic purity  Borrow learnt some languages to translate many to
speak imperfectly 22
But as a comparative philologist with claims to scientific equipment
his Targum with its boasted versions from thirty languages or
dialects pales considerably before the almost contemporary Philological
Grammar based upon a comparison of over sixty tongues by the Dorset
poet William Barnes who like Borrow himself was a selftaught man  To
mention but two more English contemporaries of Borrow there was Thomas
Watts of the British Museum who could read nearly fifty languages
including Chinese and Canon Cook the editor of the Speakers
Commentary who claimed acquaintance with fiftyfour  It is commonly
said of Cardinal Mezzofanti that he could speak thirty and understand
sixty  It is quite plain from the pages of Lavengro itself that Borrow
did not share Gregory XVIs high estimate of the Cardinals mental
qualifications unrivalled linguist though he was  That a wordmaster
so abnormal is apt to be deficient in logical sense seems to have been
Borrows deliberate opinion with a saving clause as to exceptions and
I have often thought that it must have been Shakespeares too for does
he not ascribe a command of tongues to the man who is perhaps the most
consummate idiot in the whole range of Shakespearean portraiture
MARIA  That quaffing and drinking will undo you I heard my lady talk
of it yesterday and of a foolish knight that you brought in here to
be her wooer
SIR TOBY BELCH  Who  Sir Andrew Aguecheek
MARIA  Ay he
SIR TOBY  Hes as tall a man as any in Illyria
MARIA  Whats that to the purpose
SIR TOBY  Why he has three thousand ducats a year
MARIA  Ay but hell have but a year in all these ducats hes a very
fool and a prodigal
SIR TOBY  Fie that youll say so  He plays o the viol de gamboys
and speaks three or four languages word for word without book
The extraordinary linguistic gifts of a Mezzofanti were not it is true
