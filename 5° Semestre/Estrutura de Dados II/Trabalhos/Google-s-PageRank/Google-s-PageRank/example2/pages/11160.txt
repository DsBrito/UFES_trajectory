Do not neglect the creeping hours of time the night cometh when no
man can work All time is wasted unless spent in work for God The best
secular way of spending the precious thing that men call time is by
making always for some grand enda great book to show forth the
wonders of creation and the infinite goodness of the Creator You must
influence for good if you write and write nothing that you will
regret some day or think trivial
These words written a month before the end came tell their own tale
The writer of them had a deep love for all things that are lovely
pure and of good report and in his book one sees clearly the
adoration he felt for that God whom he so faithfully served There are
many different kinds of work in this world and diversities of gifts to
him was given the spirit to discern the work of God in Natures glory
and the power to win others to see it also He had a remarkable
influence for good at Oxford and the letters from his numerous friends
and from his former tutor at Christ Church show that this influence has
never been forgotten but has left its mark not only on his college but
on the university
Like his namesake and relative Arthur Hallam of immortal memory
Arthur Gibbs had attained to a purity of soul and a wisdom which were
not of this world at an earlier age than is given to many men and so
in love and faith and hope
I would the great world grew like thee
Who grewest not alone in power
And knowledge but by year and hour
In reverence and charity

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
To those of my readers who have ever lived beside a stream or in an
ancient house or timehonoured college there will always be a peculiar
charm in silvery waters sparkling beneath the summer sun To you the
Gothic building with its carved pinnacles its warped gables its
mullioned casements and dormer windows the old oak within the very
inglenook by the great fireplace where the old folks used to sit at
home the ivy trailing round the grey walls the jessamine roses and
clematis that in their proper seasons clustered round the porchto you
all these things will have their charm as long as you live Therefore
if these pages appeal not to some such it will not be the subject that
is wanting but the ability of the writer
It is not claimed for my Cotswold village that it is one whit prettier
or pleasanter or better in any way than hundreds of other villages in
England I seek only to record the simple annals of a quiet
oldfashioned Gloucestershire hamlet and the country within walking
distance of it Nor do I doubt that there are manor houses far more
beautiful and far richer in history even within a twentymile radius of
my own home For instance the ancient house of Chavenage by Tetbury or
in the opposite direction where the northern escarpments of the
Cotswolds rise out of the beautiful Evesham Vale those historic
mediaeval houses of Southam and Postlip
It is often said that in books like these we paint arcadias that never
did and never could exist on earth To this I would answer that there
are many such abodes in country places if only our minds are such as to
realise them And above all let us be optimists in literature even
though we may be pessimists in life Let us have all that is joyous and
bright in our books and leave the trials and failures for the realities
of life Let us in our literature avoid as much as possible the painful
side of human nature and the pains and penalties of human weakness let
us endeavour to depict a state of existence as far as possible
approaching the Utopian ideal though not necessarily the Nirvana of the
Buddhists nor the paradise of fools let us look not downwards into the
depths of black despair but upwards into the starry heavens let us
gaze at the golden evening brightening in the west Richard Jefferies
has taught us that such a literature is possible and if we read his
best books we may some day be granted that fuller soul he prayed for
and at length obtained Would that we could all hear as he heard the
still small voice that whispers in the woods and among the wild flowers
and the spreading foliage by the brook
To any one who might be thinking of becoming for the time being a
tourist and in that capacity visiting the Cotswolds my advice is
Dont There is really nothing to see There is nothing that is to
say which may not be seen much nearer London And I freely confess that
most of the subjects included in this book are usually deemed unworthy
of consideration even in the district itself Still there are a few who
realise that every county in England is more or less a mine of interest
and for such I have written Realising my limitations I have not gone
deeply into any single subject my endeavour has been to touch on every
branch of country life with as light a hand as possibleto amuse rather
than to instruct For as Washington Irving delightfully sums up the
matter It is so much pleasanter to please than to instruct to play
the companion rather than the preceptor What after all is the mite of
wisdom that I could throw into the mass of knowledge or how am I sure
that my sagest deductions may be safe guides for the opinions of others
But in writing to amuse if I fail the only evil is in my own
disappointment If however I can by any lucky chance rub out one
wrinkle from the brow of care or beguile the heavy heart of one moment
of sorrow if I can now and then penetrate through the gathering film of
misanthropy prompt a benevolent view of human nature and make my
reader more in good humour with his fellow beings and himself surely
surely I shall not then have written in vain

A COTSWOLD VILLAGE
CHAPTER I
FLYING WESTWARDS
London is becoming miserably hot and dusty everybody who can get away
is rushing off north south east and west some to the seaside
others to pleasant country houses Who will fly with me westwards to the
land of golden sunshine and silvery trout streams the land of breezy
uplands and valleys nestling under limestone hills where the scream of
the railway whistle is seldom heard and the smoke of the factory
darkens not the long summer days Away in the smooth Flying Dutchman
past Windsors glorious towers and Etons playingfields past the
little village and churchyard where a century and a half ago the famous
Elegy was written and where hard by those rugged elms that
yewtrees shade yet rests the body of the mighty poet Gray How
those lines run in ones head this bright summer evening as from our
railway carriage we note the great white dome of Stoke House peeping out
amid the elms whilst every field reminds us of him who wrote those
lilting stanzas long long ago
Ah happy hills ah pleasing shade
Ah fields beloved in vain
Where once my careless childhood strayed
A stranger yet to pain
I feel the gales that from ye blow
A momentary bliss bestow
As waving fresh their gladsome wing
My weary soul they seem to soothe
And redolent of joy and youth
To breathe a second spring
But soon we are flashing past Reading where Suttons nursery gardens
are bright with scarlet and gold and blue and white every flower that
can be made to grow in our climate grows there we may be sure But
there is no need of garden flowers now when the fields and hedges even
the railway banks are painted with the lovely blue of wild geraniums
and harebells the gold of birdsfoot trefoil and Saint Johns wort and
the white and pink of convolvulus or bindweed We are passing through
some of the richest scenery in the Thames valley There on the right
is Mapledurham a grand mediaeval building surrounded by such a wealth
of stately trees as you will see nowhere else The Thames runs
practically through the grounds What a glorious carpet of gold is
spread over these meadows when the buttercups are in full bloom Now
comes Pangbourne with its lovely weir where the big Thames trout love
to lie Pangbourne used to be one of the prettiest villages on the
river but its popularity has spoilt it
As we pass onwards many other country housesPurley Basildon and
Hardwickwith their parks and clustering cottages add their charm to
the view There are the beautiful woods of Streatley hanging copses
clothe the sides of the hills and pretty villages nestle amid the
trees But soon the scene changes the glorious valley Father Thames has
scooped out for himself is left behind we are crossing the chalk
uplands On all sides are vast stretches of unfenced arable land though
here and there a tiny village with its squaretowered Norman church
peeps out from an oasis of green fields and stately elm trees On the
right the Chiltern Hills are seen in the background and Wittenham Clump
stands fortha conspicuous object for miles The country round Didcot
reminds one very much of the north of France between Calais and Paris
one notices the same chalk soil the same flat arable fields and the
same oldfashioned farmhouses and gabled cottages
But now we have entered the grand old Berkshire vale Fields and
hedges hedges and fields peace and plenty plenty and peace I should
like to take a foreigner down the vale of Berkshire in the end of May
and ask him what he thought of old England Thus wrote Charles Kingsley
forty years ago when times were better for Berkshire farmers But the
same old fields and the same old hedges still remainonly we do not
appreciate them as much as did the author of Westward Ho
Steventon that lovely village with its gables and thatched roofs its
white cottage walls set with beams of blackest oak its Norman church in
the midst of spreading chestnuts and leafy elms appears from the
railway to be one of the most oldfashioned spots on earth This vale is
full of fine old trees but in many places the farmers have spoilt their
beauty by lopping off the lower branches because the grass will not grow
under their widespreading foliage It is only in the parks and
woodlands that the real glory of the timber remains
And now we may notice what a splendid hunting country is this Berkshire
vale The fields are large and entirely grass the fences though
strong are all flying onesposts and rails too are frequent in the
hedges Many a fine scamper have the old Berkshire hounds enjoyed over
these grassy pastures where the Rosy Brook winds its sluggish course
and we trust they will continue to do so for many years to come Long
may that day be in coming when the sound of the horn is no longer heard
in this delightful country
High up on the hill the old White Horse soon appears in view cut in the
velvety turf of the rolling chalk downs But in the words of the
old ballad
The ould White Horse wants zettin to rights
He wants scouring badly A stranger if shown this old relic the
centre of a hundred legends famous the whole world over would find it
difficult to recognise any likeness to a fiery steed in those uncertain
lines of chalk Nevertheless this is the monument King Alfred made to
commemorate his victory over the Danes at Ashdown So the tradition of
the countryside has had it for a thousand years and shall a
thousand more
The horse is drawn as galloping Frank Buckland took the following
measurements of him The total length is one hundred and seventy yards
his eye is four feet across his ear fifteen yards in length his
hindleg is fortythree yards long Doubtless the full proportions of the
White Horse are not kept scoured nowadays for a few weeks ago I was up
on the hill and took some of the measurements myself I could not make
mine agree with Frank Bucklands for instance the ear appeared to be
seven yards only in length and not fifteen so that it would seem that
the figure is gradually growing smaller It is the head and forelegs
that want scouring worst of all There is little sign of the trench two
feet deep which in Bucklands time formed the outline of the horse the
depth of the cutting is now only a matter of a very few inches
The view from this hill is a very extensive one embracing the vale from
Bath almost to Reading the whole length of the Cotswold Hills as well
as the Chilterns stretching away eastwards towards Aylesbury and far
into Buckinghamshire Beneath your feet lie many hundred thousand acres
of green pastures varied in colour during summer and autumn by golden
wheatfields bright with yellow charlock and crimson poppies It has
been said that eleven counties are visible on clear days
The White Horse at Westbury further down the line represents a horse
in a standing position He reflects the utmost credit on his grooms for
not only are his shapely limbs beautifully and wonderfully made but
the greatest care is taken of him The Westbury horse is not in reality
nearly so large as this one at Uffington but he is a very beautiful
feature of the country I paid him a visit the other day and was
surprised to find he was very much smaller than he appears from the
railway Glancing over a recent edition of Tom Hughes book The
Scouring of the White Horse I found the following lines
In all likelihood the pastime of 1857 will be the last of his race
for is not the famous Saxon or British horse now scheduled to an Act
of Parliament as an ancient monument which will be maintained in time to
come as a piece of prosaic business at the cost of other than Berkshire
men reared within sight of the hill
Alas it is too true There has been no pastime since 1857
It would have been a splendid way of commemorating the diamond jubilee
if a scouring had been organised in 1897 Forty years have passed since
the last pastime with its backsword play and climmin a greasy pole for
a leg of mutton its race for a pig and a cheese and oddly enough
the previous scouring had taken place in the year of the Queens
accession sixtyone years ago It would be enough to make poor Tom
Hughes turn in his grave if he knew that the old White Horse had been
turned out to grass and left to look after himself for the rest of
his days
Those were grand old times when the Berkshire Gloucestershire and
Somersetshire men amused themselves by cracking each others heads and
cudgelplaying for a goldlaced hat and a pair of buckskin breeches
when a flitch of bacon was run for by donkeys and when last but not
least John Morse of Uffington grinned agin another chap droo hos
horse collars a fine bit of spwoart to be sure and made the folks
laaf I here quote from Tom Hughes book The Scouring of the White
Horse to which I must refer my readers for further interesting
particulars
There are some days during summer when the sunlight is so beautiful that
every object is invested with a glamour and a charm not usually
associated with it Such a day was that of which we write As we were
gliding out of Swindon the sun was beginning to descend From a Great
Western express running at the rate of sixty miles an hour through
picturesque country you may watch the sun setting amidst every variety
of scenery Now some hoary grey tower stands out against the intense
brightness of the western sky now a tracery of fine trees shades for a
time the dazzling light then suddenly the fiery furnace is revealed
again reflected perhaps in the waters of some stream or amid the reeds
and sedges of a mere where a punt is moored containing anglers in broad
wideawake hats Gradually a dark purple shade steals over the long range
of chalk hills white cleanlooking roads stand out clearly defined
miles away on the horizon the smoke that rises straight up from some
ivycovered homestead half a mile away is bluer than the evening skya
deep azure blue The horizon is clear in the south but in the
northwest dark but not forbidding clouds are rising fantastic
cloudlets float high up in the firmament rooks coming home to roost are
plainly visible several miles away against the brilliant western sky
This Great Western Railway runs through some of the finest bits of old
England Not long ago in travelling from Chepstow to Gloucester we
were fairly amazed at the surpassing beauty of the views It was
Mayday and the weather was in keeping with the occasion The sight of
the old town of Chepstow and the silvery Wye as we left them behind us
was fine enough but who can describe the magnificent panorama presented
by the wide Severn at low tide Yellow sands glittering like gold in
the dazzling sunshine stretched away for miles beyond these a vista of
green meadows with the distant Cotswold Hills rising out of dreamy
haze waters of chrysolite with fields of malachite beyond the azure
sky overhead flecked with clouds of pearl and opal and all around the
pear orchards in full bloom
While on the subject of scenery may I enter a protest against the
change the Great Western Railway has lately made in the photographs
which adorn their carriages They used to be as beautiful as one could
wish lately however the colouring has been lavished on them with no
sparing hand These photochromes are unnatural and impossible
whereas the old permanent photographs were very beautiful
At Kemble with its old manor house and stoneroofed cottages we say
goodbye to the Vale of White Horse for we have entered the Cotswolds
Stretching from Broadway to Bath and from Birdlip to Burford and
containing about three hundred square miles is a vast tract of hill
country intersected by numerous narrow valleys Probably at one period
this district was a rough uncultivated moor It is now cultivated for
the most part and grows excellent barley The highest point of this
extensive range is eleven hundred and thirtyfour feet but the average
altitude would not exceed half that height Almost every valley has its
little brook The district is essentially a stone country for all the
houses and most of their roofs are built of the local limestone which
lies everywhere on these hills within a few inches of the surface There
is no difficulty in obtaining plenty of stone hereabouts The chief
characteristics of the buildings are their antiquity and Gothic
quaintness The air is sharp and bracing and the climate as is
inevitable on the shallow porous soil of the oolite hills wonderfully
dry and invigorating Lands of gold have been found and lands of
spices and precious merchandise but this is the land of health Thus
wrote Richard Jefferies of the downs and thus say we of the Cotswolds
And now our Great Western express is gliding into Cirencester the
ancient capital of the Cotswold country How fair the old place seems
after the dirt and smoke of London Here town and country are blended
into one and everything is clean and fresh and picturesque The garish
church as you view it from the top of the marketplace has a charm
unsurpassed by any other sacred building in the land In what that charm
lies I have often wondered Is it the marvellous symmetry of the whole
graceful pile as the eye glancing down the massive square tower and
along the pierced battlements and elaborate pinnacles finally rests on
the empty niches and traceried oriel windows of the magnificent south
porch I cannot say in what the charm exactly consists but this stately
Gothic fane has a grandeur as impressive as it is unexpected recalling
those wondrous words of Ruskins
I used to feel as much awe in gazing at the buildings as on the hills
and could believe that God had done a greater work in breathing into the
narrowness of dust the mighty spirits by whom its haughty walls had been
raised and its burning legends written than in lifting the rock of
granite higher than the clouds of heaven and veiling them with their
various mantle of purple flower and shadowy pine

CHAPTER II
A COTSWOLD VILLAGE
The village is not a hundred miles from London yet far from the
madding crowds ignoble strife A green wellwooded valley in the
midst of those farstretching coldlooking Cotswold Hills it is like
an oasis in the desert
Up above on the wolds all is bleak dull and uninteresting The air up
there is ever chill walls of loose stone divide field from field and
few houses are to be seen But down in the valley all is fertile and
full of life It is here that the oldfashioned villagers dwell How
