THE RIGHI RAILROAD
In the year 1864 the wellknown geographer Heinrich Keller from Zurich
on ascending to the summit of the Righi Mountain in the heart of
Switzerland discovered one of the finest panoramic displays of mountain
scenery that he had ever witnessed To his enthusiastic descriptions some
lovers of nature in Zurich and Berne listened with much interest and in
the year 1865 Dr Abel Mr Escher von der Luith Aulic Councilor Dr
Horner and others in connection with Keller himself subscribed money to
the amount of 2000 marks 500 for the purpose of building a hotel on
the top of the mountain overlooking the view This hotel was simple
enough being merely a hut such as is to be found in abundance in the
Alps and which are built by the German and Austrian Alpine Clubs At
present the old hotel is replaced by another and more comfortable
building which is rendered accessible by a railway that ascends the
mountain Mr Riggenbach director of the railway works at Olten was the
projector of this road which was begun in 1869 and completed in 1871
Vitznau at Lucerne is the starting point The ascent which is at first
gradual soon increases one in four After a quarter of an hour the train
passes through a tunnel 240 feet in length and over an iron bridge of the
same length by means of which the Schnurtobel a deep gorge with
picturesque waterfalls is crossed At Station Freibergen a beautiful
mountain scene presents itself and the eye rests upon the glittering
icecovered ridge of the Jungfrau the Monk and the Eiger Further up is
station Kaltbad where the road forks and one branch runs to Scheideck
At about ten minutes from Kaltbad is the socalled Kanzli 4770 feet
an open rotunda on a projecting rock from which a magnificent view is
obtained The next station is Stoffelhohe from which the railroad leads
very near to the abyss on the way to RighiStoffel and from this point it
reaches its terminus RighiKulin in a few minutes This is 5905 feet
above the sea the loftiest and most northern point of the Righi group

The gauge of this railroad is the same as that of most ordinary ones
Between the rails runs a third broad and massive rail provided with teeth
which gear with a cogwheel under the locomotive The train is propelled
upward by steam power while in its descent the speed is regulated by an
ingenious mode of introducing atmospheric air into the cylinder The
carriage for the passengers is placed in both cases in front of the
engine The larger carriages have 54 seats and the smaller 34 Only one
is dispatched at a time In case of accident the train can be stopped
almost instantaneously

We give herewith from La Lumiere Electrique several engravings
illustrating the system Fig 1 shows the starting station As may be seen
on Figs 2 and 3 the method selected for obtaining adhesion permits of
ascending the steepest gradients and that too with entire security
HIGH SPEED STEAM ENGINE
The use of rapidly rotating machinery in electric lighting has created a
demand for engines running from 400 to 1200 revolutions per minute and
capable of being coupled directly to a dynamo machine We have already
illustrated several forms of these engines and now publish engravings of
another in which the most noticeable feature is the employment of separate
expansion valves and very short steam passages Many highspeed engines
labor under the wellgrounded suspicion of being heavy steam users and
their want of economy often precludes their employment Mr Chandler the
inventor of the engine illustrated above has therefore adopted a more
elaborate arrangement of valves than ordinarily obtains in engines of this
class and claims that he gains thereby an additional economy of 33 per
cent in steam The valves are cylindrical and are driven by independent
eccentrics the spindle of the cutoff valve passing through the center of
the main valve The upper valve is exposed to the steam on its top face
and works in a cylinder with a groove cut around its inner surface As
soon as the lower edge of the valve passes below the bottom lip of the
groove the steam is cut off from the space between it and the main valve
which is fitted with packing rings and works over a latticed port This
port opens directly into the cylinder The exhaust takes place chiefly
through a port uncovered when the piston is approaching the end of its
stroke The remaining vapor left in the cylinder is exhausted under the
lower edge of the main valve until cushioning commences and the steam
from both upper and lower ports is discharged into the exhaust box shown
in Fig 2 The speed of the engine is controlled by a centrifugal governor
and an equilibrium valve This is a dead face valve and when the engine
is running empty it opens and closes many times per minute The spindle
on which the valve is mounted revolves with the governor pulley and
consequently never sticks To prevent the small gland being jammed by
unequal screwing up the pressure is applied by a loose flange which is
rounded at the part which presses against the gland The governor is
adjustable while the engine is running
Illustration IMPROVED HIGH SPEED STEAM ENGINE
Another economy claimed for this engine is in the use of oil The cranks
and connecting rods work in a closed chamber the lower part of which is
filled with oil and water The oil floats in a layer on the surface of the
water and at every revolution is splashed all over the working parts
including the interior of the cylinder which it reaches through holes in
the piston The oil is maintained exactly at one level by a very ingenious
arrangement The bottom of the crank chamber communicates through a hole
C with an outer box which receives the water deposited by the exhaust
steam The level of this water is exactly determined by an overflow hole
B which allows all excess above that level to pass into an elbow of the
exhaust pipe out of which it is licked by the passing steam and carried
away Thus as the oil is gradually used the pressure of the water in the
other leg of the hydrostatic balance raises the level of the remaining
portion When a fresh supply of oil is poured into the box it forces out
some of the water and descends very nearly to the level of the hole B
The engine is made with either one or two cylinders and is of course
singleacting The pistons and connecting rods are of forged steel and
phosphorbronze The following is a list of their sizes

THE CHINESE PUMP
If a glass tube about three feet in length provided at its upper
extremity with a valve that opens outwardly and at its lower with one
that opens inwardly be dipped into water and given a series of up and
down motions the water will be seen to quickly rise therein and finally
spurt out at the top The explanation of the phenomenon is very simple
Upon immersing the tube in the water it fills as far as to the external
level of the liquid and the air is expelled from the interior If the
tube be suddenly raised without removing its lower extremity from the
water the valve will close the water will rise with the tube and
through the velocity it has acquired will ascend far above its preceding
level Now upon repeating the up and down motion of the tube in the water
five or six times the tube will be filled and will expel the liquid
every time that the vertical motion occurs
Illustration THE CHINESE PUMP
We speak here of a glass tube because with this the phenomenon may be
observed Any tube of course would produce the same results
The manufacture of the apparatus is very simple The tube is closed above
or below according to the system one desires to adopt by means of a
perforated cork The valve is made of a piece of kid skin which is fixed
by means of a bent pin and a brass wire Fig 2 It is necessary to wet
the skin in order that it may work properly and form a hermetic valve The
arrangement of the lower valve necessitates the use of a tube of
considerable diameter Fig 1 We would advise the adoption of the
arrangement shown in Fig 2 Under such circumstances a tube half an inch
in diameter and about 3 feet in length will answer very well
It is better yet to simply use ones forefinger The tube is taken in the
right hand as shown in Fig 3 and the forefinger placed over the
aperture The finger should be wetted in order to perfect its adherence
and should not be pressed too hard against the mouth of the tube It is
only necessary to plunge the apparatus a few inches into the liquid and
work it rapidly up and down when the water will rise therein at every
motion and spurt out of the top
This is an easy way of constructing the Chinese Pump which is found
described in treatises upon hydraulics Such a pump could not of course
be economically used in practice on account of the friction of the column
of water against a wide surface in the interior of the tube It is
necessary to consider the pistonless pump for what it is worthan
interesting experimental apparatus that any one can make for himselfLa

THE WATER CLOCK
To the Editor of the Scientific American
Referring to the clepsydra or water clock described and illustrated in
the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT of December 20 1884 it strikes me
that the ingenious principle embodied in that interesting device could be
put into a shape more modern and practical doing away with some of its
defects and insuring a greater degree of accuracy
Illustration Fig 1
I would propose the construction given in the subjoined sketch viz The
drum A Figs 1 and 3 is mounted in a yoke suspended in such a manner
as to bring no unnecessary but still sufficient pressure on the friction
roller B to cause it to revolve the friction cone C both cone and
roller being of wood and say well rubbed with resin so as to increase
adhesion
Illustration Fig 2
The friction roller should be movable on a screw thread but so arranged
that it can be fixed at any point say by a lock nut screw clamp or
other simple means It will be evident that by shifting the roller a
greater or less speed of the cone can be effected and as to the end of
the cones axis an index hand sweeping an ordinary clock face is attached
the speed of this index hand can be regulated to a nicety in proportion
to that of the drum Of course before fixing the size and proportion of
the disk and cone the number of revolutions of the drum in a given time
must be ascertained by experiment For instance the drum being found to
make 15 revolutions in 12 hours the proportions would be
Circumference of roller  12 units
Circumference of middle part of cone  15 units
Or the drum making 212 revolutions in 3 hours equal to 9 revolutions in
12 hours
Circumference of roller  12 units
Circumference of middle part of cone  9 units
Any slight inaccuracy can be compensated by the cone and disk device
The drum or cylinder is caused to gradually revolve by a weight attached
to an endless cord passing once around the drum The latter might be
varnished to prevent slipping The weight should be provided with an
automatic wedge allowing it to be slipped along the cord in an upward
direction but preventing its descent The weight is represented partly in
section in the engraving This weight should not be quite sufficient to
revolve the drum it being counterbalanced by the liquid raised in the
chambers of the drum The liquid however following its tendency to seek
the lowest level gradually runs back through the small hole D in the
partitions but is continually raised again with the chamber it has just
entered by the weight slightly turning the cylinder as it the weight
gradually gains advantage over the as gradually diminishing weight of each
chamber raised
As to the drum the same might be constructed as follows viz First
solder the partitions into the cylinder making them slanting or having
the direction of chords of a circle see Fig 2 The end disks should be
dish shaped as shown Place them on a level surface apply heat and melt
some mastic or good sealing wax in the same Then adjust the cylinder
part with its partitions allowing it to sink into the slight depth of
molten matter In this way or perhaps by employing a solution of rubber
instead of the sealing wax the chambers will be well isolated and not
liable to leak The water is then introduced through the center openings
of the disks before hermetically sealing the drum to its axis
Illustration Fig 3
The revolving parts of the clock being nicely balanced a pretty accurate
timepiece I should think would be the result It is needless to mention
that the winding is effected by slipping the weight to its highest
point
Of course I am far from considering the above an instrument of
precision but would rather look upon it in the light of a contrivance
interesting perhaps especially to amateur mechanics as not presenting
any particular difficulties of construction

NEW TORPEDO
We illustrate a new form of selfpropelling and steering torpedo designed
and patented by Mr Richard Paulson of Boon Hills Langwith Notts That
torpedoes will play an important part in the next naval war is evident
from the fact that great activity is being displayed by the various
governments of the world in the construction of this weapon Our own
Government also has latterly paid great attention to this subject
The methods hitherto proposed for propelling torpedoes have been by means
of carbonic acid or other compressed gas carried by the torpedoes and by
means of electricity conveyed by a conductor leading from a controlling
station to electrical apparatus carried by the torpedo The first method
has to a considerable extent failed on account of the inefficient way in
which the compressed gas was employed to propel the torpedo The second is
open to the objection that by means of telephones placed in the water or
by other signaling apparatus the torpedo can be heard approaching while
yet at a considerable distance and that a quick speeded dredger kept
ready for the purpose when any attack is expected can be run between the
torpedo and the controlling station and the conductor cut and the torpedo
captured The arrangements for steering by means of an electrical
conductor from a controlling station are also open to the latter
objection The torpedo we now illustrate in elevation in Fig 1 and in
plan in Fig 2 is designed to obviate these objections and possesses in
addition other advantages which will be enumerated in the following
description
As stated above the torpedo is selfpropelling the necessary energy
being stored up in liquefied carbonic acid contained in a cylindrical
vessel E carried by the torpedo The vessel E communicates by means
of a small bent pipe extending nearly to its bottom with a small chamber
B the passage of the liquid being controlled by means of the cock or tap
F The chamber B is in communication by means of a small aperture with
the nozzle G of an injector T constructed on the ordinary principles
The liquid as it passes into the chamber B volatilizes and the gas
passes through the nozzle of the injector which is surrounded by water in
direct communication with the sea by means of the opening W The gas
imparts its energy in the wellknown manner to the water being itself
entirely or partially condensed the water thus charged with carbonic acid
gas being forced through the combining cone of the injector at a very high
speed and pressure Preferably the water is here divided into two streams
each driving a separate rotary motor or turbine H themselves driving
twin screws or propellers I The motors exhaust into the hollow shafts
J of the propellers which are extended some distance beyond the
propellers so that the remaining energy of the water may be utilized to
aid in propelling the torpedo on the well known principle of jet
propulsion The torpedo is preferably steered by means of the twin screws
A disk or other valve A is pivoted in an aperture in a diaphragm
dividing the outlet of the injector and is operated by means hereafter
described so as to diminish the stream of water on one side and increase
it on the other so that one motor and consequently the corresponding
propeller is driven at a higher speed than the other and so steers the
torpedo
Illustration PAULSONS SELF PROPELLING AND STEERING TORPEDO
The valve A is operated automatically by the following arrangement A
mariners compass P placed in the head of the torpedo has its needle
connected to one pole of a powerful battery D A dial of nonmagnetic
material marked with the points of the compass is capable of being rotated
by the connections shown This dial carries two insulated studs p each
electrically connected with one terminal of the coils of an electromagnet
K whose other terminal is connected to the other pole of the battery
These two magnets are arranged on opposite sides of an armature fixed on a
lever operating the disk or valve A Before launching the torpedo the
dial is set so that when the torpedo is steering direct for the object to
be struck or other desired point one end of the needle of the compass
P is between the steeds p but contact with neither the needle of
course pointing to the magnetic north Should the torpedo however deviate
from this course the needle makes contact with one or other of the studs
according to the direction in which the deviation takes place and
completes the circuit through the corresponding electromagnet which
attracts the armature and causes the disk to move so as to diminish the
supply of water to one motor and increase it to the other and so cause
the torpedo to again assume the required direction Supposing the object
which it is intended that the torpedo should strike be a large mass of
iron such as an ironclad the needle will be attracted and making the
corresponding contact will cause the torpedo to be steered directly away
from the object In order to prevent this a second compass Q is mounted
in the front of the torpedo and when attracted by a mass of iron it
shortcircuits the battery D and thus prevents the armature being
attracted and consequently the torpedo from deviating This needle is
also capable of slight movement in a vertical plane so that when passing
over or under a mass of iron it is attracted downward or upward and
completes a circuit by means of the stops which operate so as to explode
the charge The charge can also be exploded in the ordinary manner viz
by means of the firing pin X when the torpedo runs into any solid
object
The depth at which the torpedo travels below the surface of the water is
regulated by means of a flexible diaphragm M secured in the outer casing
and connected to a rod sliding freely in fixed bearings A spiral or other
spring O is compressed between a color on the rod and an adjustable
fixed nut by which the tension of the spring is regulated so that the
pressure of water on the diaphragm A when the torpedo is at the desired
depth just counterbalances the pressure of the spring the diaphragm being
then flush with the outer casing The rod is connected by suitable levers
to two horizontal fins S pivoted one on either side of the torpedo so
that they shall be in equilibrium Should the torpedo sink too deep or
rise too high the diaphragm will be depressed or extended and will
operate on the lines so as to cause the torpedo to ascend or descend as
the case may be
In order to avoid the risk of a spent torpedo destroying a friendly
vessel a valve is arranged in any suitable part of the outer casing and
is weighted or loaded with a spring in such a manner that when under way
the pressure of the water keeps the valve closed but when it stops the
valve opens and admits water to sink the torpedo
In our description we have only given the main features of the invention
the inventor having mentioned to us in confidence several improvements
designed to perfect the details of his invention among which we may
mention the steering arrangement and arrangements for attacking a vessel
provided with what our contemporary Engineering not inaptly terms a
crinoline i e a network for keeping off torpedoes The transverse
dimensions of our engravings have been considerably augmented for the sake
of clearnessMech World
DUPUY DE LOME
M Dupuy De Lome died on the 1st Feb 1885 at the age of 68 It may be
questioned whether any constructor has ever rendered greater services to
the navy of any country than those rendered by M Dupuy to the French Navy
during the thirty years 184070 Since the fall of the Empire his
connection with the naval service has been terminated but his
professional and scientific standing has been fully maintained and his
energies have found scope in the conduct of the great and growing business
of the Forges et Chantiers Company In him France has undoubtedly lost
her greatest naval architect
The son of a naval officer M Dupuy was born in October 1816 near
LOrient and entered LEcole Polytechnique when nineteen years of age
In that famous establishment he received the thorough preliminary training
which France has so long and wisely provided for those who are to become
the designers of her warships After finishing his professional
education he came to England about 1842 and made a thorough study of
iron shipbuilding and steam navigation in both of which we then held a
long lead of France His report subsequently published under the title of
Memoire sur la Construction des Batiments en FerParis 1844is
probably the best account given to the world of the state of iron
shipbuilding forty years ago and its perusal not merely enables one to
gauge the progress since made but to form an estimate of the great
ability and clear style of the writer We may assume that this visit to
England coming after the thorough education received in Francem did much
toward forming the views to which expression was soon given in designs and
reports on new types of war ships
Illustration M DUPUY DE LOME
When the young constructor settled down to his work in the arsenal at
Toulon on his return from England the only armed steamships in the
French Navy were propelled by paddlewheels and there was great
opposition to the introduction of steam power into lineofbattle ships
The paddlewheel was seen to be unsuited to such large fighting vessels
and there was no confidence in the screw while the great majority of
naval officers in France as well as in England were averse to any
decrease in sail spread M Dupuy had carefully studied the details of the
Great Britain which he had seen building at Bristol and was convinced
that full steam power should be given to lineofbattle ships He grasped
and held fast to this fundamental idea and as early as the year 1845 he
addressed a remarkable report to the Minister of Marine suggesting the
construction of a fullpowered screw frigate to be built with an iron
hull and protected by a belt of armor formed by several thicknesses of
iron plating This report alone would justify his claim to be considered
the leading naval architect of that time it did not bear fruit fully for
some years but its recommendations were ultimately realized
M Dupuy did not stand alone in the feeling that radical changes in the
construction and propulsion of ships were imminent His colleagues in the
Genie Maritime were impressed with the same idea and in England about
this date the earliest screw linersthe wonderful converted block
shipswere ordered This action on our part decided the French also to
begin the conversion of their sailing lineofbattle ships into vessels
with auxiliary steam power But M Dupuy conceived and carried out the
bolder scheme of designing a fullpowered screw liner and in 1847 the
Napoleon was ordered Her success made the steam reconstruction of the
fleets of the world a necessity She was launched in 1850 tried in 1852
and attained a speed of nearly 14 knots an hour During the Crimean War
her performances attracted great attention and the type she represented
was largely increased in numbers She was about 240 ft in length 55 ft
in breadth and of 5000 tons displacement with two gun decks In her
design boldness and prudence were well combined The good qualities of
the sailing lineofbattle ships which had been secured by the genius of
Sane and his colleagues were maintained while the new conditions involved
in the introduction of steam power and large coal supply were thoroughly
fulfilled The steam reconstruction had scarcely attained its full swing
when the ironclad reconstructor became imperative Here again M Dupuy
occupied a distinguished position and realized his scheme of 1845 with
certain modifications His eminent services led to his appointment in 1857
to the highest office in the Constructive CorpsDirecteur du
Materieland his design for the earliest seagoing ironclad La Gloire
was approved in the same year Once started the French pressed on the
construction of their ironclads with all haste and in the autumn of 1863
they had at sea a squadron of five ironclads not including in this list
La Gloire It is unnecessary to trace further the progress of the race for
maritime supremacy but to the energy and great ability of M Dupuy de
Lome must be largely attributed the fact that France took and for a long
time kept such a lead of us in ironclads In the design of La Gloire as
is well known he again followed the principle of utilizing known forms
and dimensions as far as was consistent with modern conditions and the
Napoleon was nearly reproduced in La Gloire so far as underwater shape
was concerned but with one gun deck instead of two and with a completely
protected battery So long as he retained office M Dupuy consistently
adhered to this principle but he at the same time showed himself ready to
consider how best to meet the constantly growing demands for thicker
armor heavier guns and higher speeds It is singular however
especially when his early enthusiasm for iron ships is remembered to find
how small a proportion of the ships added to the French Navy during his
occupancy of office were built of anything but wood
Distinctions were showered upon him In 1860 he was made a Councilor of
State and represented the French Admiralty in Parliament from 1869 to
1875 he was a Deputy and in 1877 he was elected a Life Senator He was a
member of the Academy of Sciences and of other distinguished scientific
bodies Of late his name has been little connected with ship design but
his interest in the subject was unabated
In 1870 M Dupuy devoted a large amount of time and thought to perfecting
a system of navigable balloons and the French Government gave him great
assistance in carrying out the experiments It does not seem however
that any sufficient success was reached to justify further trials The
theoretical investigations on which the design was based and the
ingenuity displayed in carrying out the construction of the balloon were
worthy of M Dupuys high reputation The fleet that he constructed for
France has already disappeared to a great extent and the vessels still
remaining will soon fall out of service But the name and reputation of
their designer will live as long as the history of naval construction is
studiedThe Engineer
THE USE OF GAS IN THE WORKSHOP
At a recent meeting of the Manchester Association of Employers Foremen
and Draughtsmen of the Mechanical Trades of Great Britain an interesting
lecture on Gas for Light and Work in the Workshop was delivered by Mr
T Fletcher FCS of Warington
Mr Fletcher illustrated his remarks with a number of interesting
experiments and spoke as follows
There are very few workshops where gas is used so profitably as it might
be and my object tonight is to make a few suggestions which are the
result of my own experience In a large space such as an erecting or
moulders shop it is always desirable to have all the lights distributed
about the center Wall lights except for bench work are wasteful as a
large proportion of the light is absorbed by the walls and lost Unless
the shop is draughty it is by far the best policy to have a few large
burners rather than a number of small ones I will show you the difference
in the light obtained by burning the same quantity of gas in one and in
two flames I do not need to tell you how much the difference is you can
easily see for yourselves The additional light is not caused as some of
you may suppose by a combined burner as I have here a simple one
burning the same quantity of gas as the two smaller burners together and
the advantage of the simple large burner is quite as great It is a
wellknown fact that the larger the gas consumption in a single flame the
higher the duty obtained for the gas burnt There is a practical limit to
this with ordinary simple burners as when they are too large they are
very sensitive to draught and liable to unsteadiness and smoking I have
here a sample of a works pendant or pillar light which not including
the gas supplypipe can be made for about a shilling For all practical
purposes I believe this light which carries five No 6 Brays union jets
and which we use as a portable light at repairs and breakdowns is as
efficient and economical a form as it is possible to make for ordinary
rough work The burners are in the best position and the light is both
powerful and quite shadowless giving in fact the best light underneath
the burners It must of course be protected in a draughty shop and on
this protection something needs to be said
Regenerator burners for lighting are coming into use and where large
lights are required for long periods no doubt they are economical
Burners of the Bower or Wenham class would be worth adopting for main
street or open space lighting in important positions but when we consider
that with the fiftyfour hours system in workshops artificial light is
only wanted on an average for four hundred hours per annum we may take
it as certain that at the present prices of regenerator burners they are
a bad investment for use in ordinary work We must not forget that the
distance of the burner from the work is a vital point of the cost
question and for all except large spaces requiring general
illumination a common cheap burner on a swivel joint has yet to meet with
a competitor Do not think I am oldfashioned or prejudiced in this
matter It is purely a question of figures and my condemnation of
regenerator burners applies only to the general requirements in ordinary
engineering and other work shops where each man wants a light on one spot
only
Some people think that clear glass does not stop any light This is a
great mistake as you will find it quite easy to throw a distinct shadow
of a sheet of perfect glass on a white paper as I will show you Opal and
ground glass throw a very strong shadow and practically waste half the
light It is better to have a white enameled or whitewashed sheetiron
reflecting hood which will protect the sides from wind if such an
arrangement suits other requirements
I have endeavored in the engraving below to reproduce the shadows thrown
