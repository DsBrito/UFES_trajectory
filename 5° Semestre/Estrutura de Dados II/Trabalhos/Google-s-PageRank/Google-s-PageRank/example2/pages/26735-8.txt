MABEL HOWARD AND HER PET
After all I think I had more real delight in the noble public parks
and gardens of London than in palaces and cathedrals They were all
wonders and novelties to mefor to our misfortune and discreditwe
have nothing of the kind in our country  To see the poor little public
squares in our towns and cities where a few stunted trees seem huddled
together as though scared by the great redfaced houses that crowd so
close upon them one would think that we were sadly stinted and
straitened for land instead of being loosely scattered over a vast
continent many times larger than all Great Britain
The English government with all its faults has always been wise and
generous toward the people in regard to their outdoor comfort and
pleasure  It does not mean that they shall be stifled for want of air
or cramped for room to exercise in  Everywhere over the kingdom the
traveller sees shady parks pleasant gardens breezy downs and wide
heaths open to the public and as much for the enjoyment of the poor
as the rich
The great Hyde Park of London has been the property of the crown since
the time of Henry VIII  It was formerly walled in and held deer for
royal huntingbut in the reign of George IV it was inclosed with an
open iron railing and is now only used for drives promenades rides
and military reviews
Connected with Hyde Park by a bridge over the Serpentine an
artificial river are Kensington Gardens beautiful pleasuregrounds
attached to Kensington Palace a building belonging to the royal family
This palace was for several years the town residence of the widowed
Duchess of Kent and here her illustrious daughter the princess now
Queen Victoria was educated
Strangers sometimes met the young princess walking in the gardens or
saw her sitting under the shade of the trees accompanied by her
mother or governess  She was always very simply dressed and always
wore a sweet gentle look on her fresh young face
In Hyde Park every pleasant afternoon there may be seen hosts of
splendid equipages and hundreds of ladies and gentlemen mounted on
elegant horses riding up and down a long broad avenue called Rotten
Row which is devoted entirely to equestrians
In Hyde Park stood the Crystal Palacenow removed to Sydenhamwhere
it stands on an eminence and seems in itself a great mountain of light
A smaller but yet a fine park is that of St James  King Charles I
walked through this from the Palace of St James to the scaffold before
White Hall on the morning of his execution  He was very calm and on
his way he pointed out a tree to one of his attendants as having been
planted by his brother the young Prince Henry who if he had lived
would have been kingand poor Charles might have kept his head
which doubtless was of more value to him than all the crowns of all
the kingdoms of the world
King Charles II made many improvements in this park and took much
pleasure in riding sporting and idly strolling here  He might often
be seen with half a dozen dogs at his heels lounging along by the
banks of the ponds feeding the ducks with his own delicate royal
hands  The foolish people were greatly moved and delighted at this
thinking that a king who could be so kind and gracious to dogs and
ducks must be a good sovereign but they were wofully mistaken there
Regents Park was so named for the Prince Regent afterwards George IV
This park is extensive and exceedingly beautiful  It has winding
roads and shady paths ornamental plantations clear shining sheets of
waternoble trees and fairylike bowers so secluded and shadowy that
the birds sing and nest in them as fearlessly as in the deep heart of a
country wood
Within this park are several elegant villasamong which I best
remember St Dunstans Villathe residence of the late Marquis of
Hertford about whom and this place I have heard a pretty little story
which I will tell you
In Fleet Street London stands the Church of St Dunstan built on the
site of a church of the same name which was torn down about thirty
years ago
The old Church of St Dunstan had a curious clock which was considered
a very wonderful piece of mechanism almost a work of witchcraft
Standing out on the side of the church in full view of the passersby
were two figures of Hercules holding clubs with which they struck on
two bells the hours and the quarters  All children took delight in
watching these gigantic figures but none so much as the little Marquis
of Hertford whose kind nurse used to take him to see themwhenever he
was a particularly good boy  Every time that he saw them he would
strike his hands together and declare that as soon as he was a grown
man he would buy those beautiful giants and have them all to himself
Well strangely enough when the Marquis grew to be a man and got
possession of all his property and built his new villa in Regents
Park it happened that old St Dunstans Church was torn down and that
famous clock set up at auction  So the Marquis who had never
forgotten his beloved giants bought them and set them up in his
garden where night and day rain or shine they still stand sturdily
swinging their big clubs striking the hours and the quarters
St Dunstans Villa contains fine marble statues rare bronzes vases
and pictures and much costly furniture but nothing in all the house
or grounds was half so dear to the Marquis as that quaint old clock
and those uncouth giantsfor the sight of them always took him back to
the time when he was a happy innocent child and thought them the most
wonderful things in all the world
Regents Park contains The Botanical Gardens where are to be seen
almost all species and varieties of plants and flowers  In a great
conservatory I saw the Victoria Regia the largest aquatic plant in
the world  Its vast leaves lie on the water like those of the
waterlily which they resembleand so broad and thick are they that
it is said a little girl of six years may stand on one of them without
weighing it down enough to wet her feet
But the most interesting portions of Regents Park are the Zoological
Gardens where are kept all varieties of beasts birds and serpents
I had far more pleasure in visiting these gardens than I had ever found
in seeing collections of wild beasts in our own country because the
animals themselves seemed so much more comfortable and happy  I had
been accustomed to see the lions leopards tigers and bears cramped
up in miserable little grated boxes and looking as fierce surly and
wretched as possible  But here they walked up and down large airy
cages or stretched themselves out in the sun or dozed in their
sleepingroomswith no brutal showmen to molest them and no Van
Amburgh to make them afraidand seemed really very well to do
goodhumored and contented  Even the polar bear who had a quiet
shady retreat seemed to be taking matters coolly instead of panting
and lolling and tumbling about in the old uncomfortable way
The zebras looked almost amiable and the hyenas respectable while the
poor camels wore a far less woebegone expression than those
longsuffering animals are expected to wear  As for the monkeys apes
and ourangoutangs they were the noisiest jolliest most frolicsome
set of creatures you can imagine
In a yard by themselves we saw several giraffes who appeared to be
having a pleasant gossipping time overlooking the affairs of all their
neighbors  It seemed to me that if they could put their necks
together they would reach almost as high as Jacks famous beanstalk
climbed
Very curious sights to me were the rhinoceros and hippopotamus both of
whom I saw luxuriating in great vats of muddy water  This hippopotamus
is an enormous animal very clumsy in his motions and rather indolent
in his habits  He has an Arab keeper of whom he is so fond that he
will take food from no one elsewill not even sleep away from him
The Arab is said to return his fat friends affection and by no means
objects to him as a bedfellow
A strange piteouslooking creature was the seal that I saw stretched
on a rock at the edge of a little pond  Its eyes were large and dark
and sadso like human eyes that I shuddered as I looked at them for
it almost seemed that the poor helpless seal itself was a human form
bound and pinioned and flung down there to die
I have no fancy for serpentsindeed to tell the truth I detest and
fear themso I did not visit that department
Among the birds I was most amused by the large collection of parrots
When I entered the gallery in which they are kept I was almost crazed
by the confusion of tongues  There were scores of parrots parroquets
macaws and cockatoos all chattering and laughing and screaming
together  It was like a village school just let out or a large party
of gossiping ladies over their tea
No two were alike except in namefor the majority were Pollies  Some
were ugly yet were vain enough to call themselves pretty and some
were beautiful and sleek and plump though they piteously declared
themselves poor and begged of us as we passed
And now I will tell you a little storysomething very simple in
itself but which I hope will serve to impress this chapter upon your
memories
MABEL HOWARD AND HER PET
Mabel Howard my little heroine was not exactly an English girl
though she was the daughter of English parents  She was born in India
in Calcutta where her father Colonel Howard was stationed for
several years with his regiment  Mabel was not I am sorry to say a
bright and blooming little maiden though she had a sweet intelligent
face and very endearing ways  From her birth she had been pale
slight and feeble  The climate was very bad for her and though all
possible pains were taken with her health she did not gain strength
but grew weaker and weaker  At last when she was about nine years of
age it was resolved to send her to England to stay with her
grandparents who lived in London  Neither her papa nor her mamma
could go with her but Katuka her ayah or native nurse a kind
faithful woman would go and stay with her always and a friend of
Colonel Howard an officer returning home would take charge of them
both till they should reach London
Poor Mabels loving little heart was almost broken at the thought of
being sent so far away from her papa and mamma and babybrother but
she knew it was all meant for her good and did not complain
Of all Mabels pets she loved best a beautiful red and white cockatoo
that her papa had given her on her seventh birthday
Bobbyfor so this favorite was calledwas a very knowing bird
indeedtalking fluently if not wisely in both English and
Hindostanee and though somewhat vain of his beauty and
accomplishments and a little too selfish and fond of good living
never arrogant or surly but the most gracious and amiable of cockatoos
Bobby had a fine gilded cage which hung in a shaded veranda where the
family sat in the cool morning and evening hours so when not talking
or talked to himself he picked up a good deal of knowledge by
listening to the conversation of others
Everybody liked Bobby he was so clever and comical but Mabel not only
liked and petted him but cared for him constantly patiently
ministered to his dainty appetite and tried always to teach him good
and useful things  Indeed I am afraid that if it had not been for
his young mistress Bobby would have been a wicked little heathen like
other Hindoo cockatoos
When Mabel was told that she must go to England almost the first words
which she sobbed out were May I take Bobby
Of course darling said her papa Bobby shall go with you
But on the morning when Katuka and her young mistress sailed lo Bobby
was nowhere to be found  He had been stolen in his cage from the
veranda and carried away during the night by some straggling native
and poor little Mabel was obliged to go away with a new grief weighing
down her tender childish heart  All through the long voyage she
missed and mourned for her lost pet and when she reached London her
good grandmamma could give her nothing that would quite take its place
Everybody was kind to the lonely little girl and much was done to make
her well and happy  Every day her grandmamma or her good ayah took her
to drive or walk in Hyde Park or Kensington Gardens or out on the
open breezy heaths and Mabel soon grew better healthier and
stronger and a soft color stole into her pale cheeks and deepened and
brightened day by day like the flush of an opening rose
Mabel dearly loved her kind English friends but there were sometimes
chill wintry days or dull rainy evenings when she was very homesick
and cried to see again her faroff Indian home her papa and mamma and
little babybrother
At such times she would often say to her kind ayah who wept with her
Ah Katuka if I only had poor Bobby here it would be some
consolation
One day when Mabel had been about six months in England her
grandmamma took her to the Zoological Gardens  She was greatly
interested in seeing the animals though she shrank away with a shudder
from the tigers of whom she had heard fearful stories in India  At
last they entered a long beautiful gallery all hung with bright
gilded cages of gorgeous birds mostly parrots of many different
species  As Mabel walked slowly along admiring the pretty chattering
creatures but sadly remembering her lost Bobby and thinking that no
one of all these was half so beautiful as he suddenly she heard from
a cage just before her a joyous familiar cry Good morning Miss
Mabelcome to bring Bobby dinner  Poor Bobby hungry
With a cry of delight Mabel sprang forward and flung her arms about
the cage and kissed the crimsontuffed head of a pretty cockatoo
thrust through the barsBobbys headfor it was indeed her own dear
lost bird
Sir John Howard Mabels grandfather was able to buy Bobby of the
Zoological Society who had bought him of a sailor from Calcutta so
Mabel had her pet again
He seemed the same intelligent affectionate bird as ever  He had
forgotten nothing he had ever known but he had learned some rather
rough sayings of the sailors on his voyage from India which did not
go very well with the good things his gentle little mistress had taught
him  But for all that he was a great comfort to her and she never
was homesick any more
After a few years Mabels papa mamma and little brother came to
England to livenever to return to India  Ah there was a joyful
meeting one morning in Leicester Square  Sir John and Lady Howard
were overjoyed to see their darling only son again and he bronzed and
weatherbeaten soldier as he was felt as glad to get home as he had
ever been when he was a homesick schoolboy at Eton  Mrs Howard was
welcomed as a real daughter and her beautiful little boy almost
smothered with kisses  Mabel was half wild with happiness and her
parents were surprised and delighted to find her grown so healthy and
handsome  The faithful Katuka kissed the hands of her master and
mistress with tears of joywhile Bobby grown impatient at not being
noticed called out sharply from his perchAvast there shipmates
what a hullabaloo  Bobby wants breakfast
St Pauls Cathedral
STORY OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY
The Cathedral Church of St Pauls is the largest religious edifice in
London and one of the largest in the world  It stands on high ground
in the centre of the city and can be seen for a long distance in
several directions though it is too closely surrounded by other large
buildings to show to the best advantage  It is less beautiful than
some of the old English minsters but in size grander than any  It is
built in the form of a Greek cross and covers more than two acres of
ground  The dome is nearly as large as that of St Peters at Rome
and from every part of the vast city of London you can see it looming
up toward the skya dark stupendous objectsometimes gilded by the
setting sun sometimes wreathed by the mists of morning  The dome is
surmounted by a cupola called the lantern over which is placed an
immense ball of gilt copper weighing five thousand six hundred pounds
and bearing above it a gilt cross weighing three thousand six hundred
pounds
The interior of the cathedral is very grand but rather dark and
gloomy even under the great central light of the domeexcept when
viewed by a very clear sunshine the rarest thing in the world in
great London town for what with the smoke the fog and the rain
the poor old sun has few opportunities of making himself agreeable to
the Londoners  But when he does get a chance to shine he seems to
make the most of it and surely nothing can be more pleasant than a
right Transcribers note bright sunny morning in London  On such a
morning we visited St Pauls Cathedral
Before ascending to the dome we wandered about for some time in the
nave and transept examining with much interest the monuments statues
and tablets erected in honor of celebrated English poets artists
soldiers naval heroes and statesmen and seeking out the famous
epitaph of the noble architect and the great and good man Sir
Christopher Wren  This is in Latin but translated reads thus
Beneath lies Christopher Wren the architect of this church and city
who lived more than ninety years not for himself alone but for the
public  Reader do you seek his monument look around
About the interior of the dome are a series of pictures illustrating
the life of St Paul  An incident occurred during the painting of
these which I will relate as a remarkable instance of presence of
mind  The artist Sir James Thornhill painted standing on a scaffold
erected of course at a great height from the ground  This scaffold was
securely built but not protected by any railing  One day while
fortunately a friend was with him watching him at his workhaving just
finished the head of one of the apostles he forgot where he was and
with his hand over his eyes stepped hastily backward to see how the
picture would look from a distance  In a moment he stood on the very
edge of the platform another stepanother inch backward were certain
death  His friend dared not speak for fear of startling him but
catching up a large brush he dashed it over the face of the apostle
smearing the picture shockingly  Sir James sprang forward instantly
crying out
Bless my soul what have you done  I have saved your life
replied his friend calmly  For the next moment the two stood face to
face very pale and still but thanking God fervently in their full
loudbeating hearts
Within the dome is The Whispering Gallery  This is surely very
curious the least whisper breathed against the wall at a certain
point being distinctly heard on the opposite side of the gallery or
making the entire inner circle of the great dome  After a long weary
ascent of very dirty and dark staircases we reached the cupola and
great London and its environs lay beneath us  Oh what a wide and
wonderful view was that  It was almost overwhelmingand so bewildered
me at first that I could not clearly make out any thing  But soon
that dizziness of astonishment passed away and I began to recognize
one after another places and buildings that had grown familiar to me
There was Hyde Park looking at that distance like a plantation of
young trees there was Buckingham Palace the new palace of
Westminster and the grand old Abbey  I could see the flash of the
fountains in Trafalgar Square and trace the silver winding of the
Thames through miles on miles of docks and warehouses under dark
bridges past darker prisons far up into the green and smiling
country and far down toward the blue and shining sea  There was the
Tower which though not a dark or dilapidated building always has a
guilty gloomy lookafter you know what it is  There was the
Monument towering toward the sky in memory of the great conflagration
in London when where those magnificent buildings now stand were
piles and masses of fireand great flames going up in red columns to
heaven
Brightly shone the sun on hundreds of spires and domes cheerily
lighting up all that vast scene beneath us the wide elegant streets
open squares and parks of the town and the busy crowded streets and
narrow lanes of the city  The kindly rays fell just as warmly and
clearly into the dark and damp courts of the miserable parish of St
Giles as on to the noble terraces and into the palace gardens of
fashionable West End  Oh the beautiful sunshine  Gods manna of
lightfalling for the poor as well as for the rich
While standing on that lofty balcony I could but faintly hear that
great noise of business and travel which roars along London streets
without ceasing day or night  It was like being at the summit of a
high rock on the seashore where the hoarse sound of the great waves
comes up to your ear softened to a low deep murmur
Old St Pauls upon the site of which this noble cathedral now
stands was burned in the fire of 1660  Among the great men buried in
Old St Pauls was Sir Philip Sidney the most brilliant and the
best man of Queen Elizabeths court  Let me tell you more about him
STORY OF SIR PHILIP SIDNEY
Philip Sidney was born in November 1554  He was the son of Sir Henry
Sidney the dear friend of the amiable young King Edward VI who died
in his arms and of the Lady Mary only daughter of the ambitious and
unfortunate Duke of Northumberland
From his early childhood Philip was remarkable for his genius his
beauty his sweet and generous disposition and the modesty and grace
of his manners  Sir Fulke Grevillewho was one of his schoolmates
knew him all his life and so dearly loved and highly honored him that
he directed it should be put on his tombstone that he was the friend
of Sir Philip Sidneysaid of him that while yet a child he seemed
a man in gravity and wisdom in steadiness of purpose and love of
knowledge and that even his teachers found in him something to wonder
at and learn above what they could find in books or were able to
teach
At the age of twelve Philip corresponded with his father in French and
Latin with correctness and elegance at thirteen he entered the
University at Oxford where he distinguished himself by his
scholarship by his noble character and blameless life  At the age of
seventeen having left college he went to Paris in the suite of the
Earl of Lincoln the ambassador extraordinary of Queen Elizabeth to the
court of France  Because of his high connections and reputation and
the letters which he carried from his uncle Robert Dudley Earl of
Leicester he was received with much distinction  Charles IX a
courteous though treacherous prince and his wily mother Catharine de
Medicis were extremely gracious to him  The king gave him an office
of honor in his palace and strove in various ways to win his regard
and confidence  But Philip neither liked nor trusted him but gave the
respect and friendship of his noble heart to a more truly royal object
the brave and good King Henry of Navarre
It was soon evident what secret object King Charles had in trying to
conciliate the English at his court  It was to blind their eyes that
they should not foresee and help to arrest one of the most fearful and
cruel crimes to be found in the dark history of Catholic persecution
the Massacre of St Bartholomew  Charles his wicked mother and the
priests their advisers chose this time when a large number of
Protestants were assembled at Paris on the occasion of the marriage of
the young Prince of Navarre to the sister of the King of France for a
general massacre of the Huguenots throughout the city and kingdom  On
St Bartholomews day the slaughter began and lasted until many
thousand Protestantsmen women and childrenwere murdered shot
down and cut down in their houses their churches and in the open
street  King Charles himself though scarcely more than a boy was the
most brutal and bloodthirsty of all the persecutors  He stood at one
of the windows of his palace and fired at the poor shrieking
struggling people as fast as his carbine could be loaded  Many a
brave Christian father and noble youth were laid low by his cruel shot
in those dreadful streets and courts where the hard stones steamed
with warm blood as meadows in May mornings smoke with ascending dews
and where down the very gutters instead of swift currents of summer
rain ran sluggish red rivulets slowly flowing from the bodies of the
dead and dying piled on either side  But though that bad and mad
young king cruelly meant every shot and though every drop of blood he
shed was a guiltstain on his soul and every dying groan he caused was
to ring on his ear and pierce his wicked heart till he died yet after
all he harmed only the poor perishing bodies of his victims their
deathless souls he but early set free from mortal bondage and hastened
home to God
But to return to Philip Sidney  During the massacre he took refuge
with the English resident minister Sir Francis Walsingham one of the
most distinguished men of the age and court of Elizabeth
Sir Francis had a young daughter a beautiful sweettempered little
girl in whom Philip Sidney became much interested  This child felt
very deeply for the poor Huguenot martyrs  She prayed for them
constantly and wept for them tears of bitter anguish that seemed to
quench the glad sparkle of her tender blue eyes and to wash all the
rosy bloom from her soft round cheeks
Philip who saw her sadness often tried to comfort her but her grief
and her sweet sorrowful words always so touched his own tender heart
that his manly voice trembled and sometimes he bowed his beautiful
face on her head as it lay on his breast and wept with her silently
And so he grew to love her and she loved him more than all the world
As soon as quiet was restoreda sad quiet it wasPhilip Sidney set
out to travel in Germany and Italy  He was glad to leave Paris its
vile court and viler king he was sorry to leave nobody but little
Fanny Walsingham
Soon after returning to England and when only twentyone Sidney was
sent as ambassador to Vienna by Queen Elizabeth who knew how to
perceive talent and worth though she did not always reward them
generously  He faithfully discharged the duties of his office and was
most honorably received by the queen on his return  But he was not of
the stuff out of which courtiers are made  He was too honest
independent and disinterested to gain wealth or power by intrigue or
flattery so though the queen respected him and often advised with
him he received neither gifts nor offices but lived for several years
in retirement devoting himself to study and writing
In 1583 he married Frances only daughter of Sir Francis Walsingham
his well remembered little friend now grown into a beautiful woman
well worthy of his noble love  During that same year he was knighted
by the queen at Windsor and became Sir Philip Sidney
By the time that he reached the age of thirty the fame of his many
splendid qualitieshis learning and literary talent his bravery and
above all his noble honestyhad spread over Europe while in England
he was the glory of the court and the idol of the people
There are a kind of little great men who seek to impose on you by
pompous ways proud looks and highsounding words but there was no
such poor pride and pretension about Sir Philip Sidney  He was gay and
freehearted frank in his words simple and gentle in his manner and
always earnest in the endeavor to be and do good  His writings were
full of noble thought and pure sweet feeling worthy his true heart
and his great soul
In 1585 a wonderful tribute was paid to the talent and exalted worth
of Sir Philip Sidney
The throne of Poland having become vacant by the death of Stephen
Bathori he was invited to enroll himself among the candidates  He
does not seem to have been tempted by this splendid opportunity of
obtaining sovereign power and honors but cheerfully acquiesced in the
queens will that he should remain her loyal subject  She said rather
selfishly I think that she could not consent to lose the jewel of
her times
Soon after this she appointed him to a military command in the Low
Countries  Here he soon distinguished himself by skilful generalship
rare coolness in danger and courage in action  At last on the 24th
of September 1586 in a gallant attack on a greatly superior force of
the enemy near Zutphen a town he was besieging after having had one
horse shot from under him he was severely wounded by a musketball in
the left leg
As his soldiers were bearing him from the field of battle toward his
camp he grew very faint from loss of blood and asked for water  It
was brought to him but just as the glass was raised to his parched
lips he caught the eye of a poor dying soldier fixed wistfully upon
it  In an instant he passed it to him without having tasted a drop
saying Drink my friend thy necessity is yet greater than mine
Oh in all his noble life Sir Philip Sidney had never done so grand a
deed as this  It was in truth a Christlike act though performed
upon a bloody battlefieldand it will be remembered and honored
while the world endures
Sir Philips wound was unskilfully treated and finally caused his
death  He died at Arnheim about the middle of the next month
This seemed a sad closing to so brilliant a life  Far away from
country and home from his dearest friends his beloved wife and his
darling child with no loving one to sympathize with him in his pain
and comfort him in his sadnessto listen reverently to his dying
words to close tenderly his darkened eyes and to weep over the pale
beauty of his dead face  But we may trust from all we know of his
pure Christian life that comforting angels were near him whispering
hope and peace to his heartthat divine love sustained him and we may
feel assured that for the gift of that cup of cold water to the
dying soldier his soul drunk deep of the waters of life that now from
the throne of the Lamb and make beautiful forever the Paradise of God
