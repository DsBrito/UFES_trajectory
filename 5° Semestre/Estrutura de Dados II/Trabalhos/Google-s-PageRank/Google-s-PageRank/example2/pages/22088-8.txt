This was my state of mind as it had been for many years when in the
beginning of 1864 I unexpectedly found myself publicly put upon my
defence and furnished with an opportunity of pleading my cause before
the world and as it so happened with a fair prospect of an impartial
hearing Taken indeed by surprise as I was I had much reason to be
anxious how I should be able to acquit myself in so serious a matter
however I had long had a tacit understanding with myself that in the
improbable event of a challenge being formally made to me by a person
of name it would be my duty to meet it That opportunity had now
occurred it never might occur again not to avail myself of it at once
would be virtually to give up my cause accordingly I took advantage of
it and as it has turned out the circumstance that no time was allowed
me for any studied statements has compensated in the equitable judgment
of the public for such imperfections in composition as my want of
leisure involved
It was in the number for January 1864 of a magazine of wide
circulation and in an Article upon Queen Elizabeth that a popular
writer took occasion formally to accuse me by name of thinking so
lightly of the virtue of Veracity as in set terms to have countenanced
and defended that neglect of it which he at the same time imputed to the
Catholic Priesthood His words were these
Truth for its own sake had never been a virtue with the Roman
clergy Father Newman informs us that it need not and on the
whole ought not to be that cunning is the weapon which heaven
has given to the Saints wherewith to withstand the brute male
force of the wicked world which marries and is given in
marriage Whether his notion be doctrinally correct or not it
is at least historically so
These assertions going far beyond the popular prejudice entertained
against me had no foundation whatever in fact I never had said I
never had dreamed of saying that truth for its own sake need not and
on the whole ought not to be a virtue with the Roman Clergy or that
cunning is the weapon which heaven has given to the Saints wherewith to
withstand the wicked world To what work of mine then could the writer
be referring In a correspondence which ensued upon the subject between
him and myself he rested his charge against me on a Sermon of mine
preached before I was a Catholic in the pulpit of my Church at Oxford
and he gave me to understand that after having done as much as this
he was not bound over and above such a general reference to my Sermon
to specify the passages of it in which the doctrine which he imputed
to me was contained On my part I considered this not enough and I
demanded of him to bring out his proof of his accusation in form and in
detail or to confess he was unable to do so But he persevered in his
refusal to cite any distinct passages from any writing of mine and
though he consented to withdraw his charge he would not do so on the
issue of its truth or falsehood but simply on the ground that I assured
him that I had had no intention of incurring it This did not satisfy my
sense of justice Formally to charge me with committing a fault is one
thing to allow that I did not intend to commit it is another it is no
satisfaction to me if a man accuses me of this offence for him to
profess that he does not accuse me of that but he thought
differently Not being able then to gain redress in the quarter where I
had a right to ask it I appealed to the public I published the
correspondence in the shape of a Pamphlet with some remarks of my own
at the end on the course which that correspondence had taken
This Pamphlet which appeared in the first weeks of February received a
reply from my accuser towards the end of March in another Pamphlet of
48 pages entitled What then does Dr Newman mean in which he
professed to do that which I had called upon him to do that is he
brought together a number of extracts from various works of mine
Catholic and Anglican with the object of showing that if I was to be
acquitted of the crime of teaching and practising deceit and dishonesty
according to his first supposition it was at the price of my being
considered no longer responsible for my actions for as he expressed
it I had a human reason once no doubt but I had gambled it away
and I had worked my mind into that morbid state in which nonsense was
the only food for which it hungered and that it could not be called a
hasty or farfetched or unfounded mistake when he concluded that I did
not care for truth for its own sake or teach my disciples to regard it
as a virtue and though too many prefer the charge of insincerity to
that of insipience Dr Newman seemed not to be of that number
He ended his Pamphlet by returning to his original imputation against
me which he had professed to abandon Alluding by anticipation to my
probable answer to what he was then publishing he professed his
heartfelt embarrassment how he was to believe any thing I might say in
my exculpation in the plain and literal sense of the words I am
henceforth he said in doubt and fear as much as an honest man can
be concerning every word Dr Newman may write How can I tell that I
shall not be the dupe of some cunning equivocation of one of the three
kinds laid down as permissible by the blessed St Alfonso da Liguori and
his pupils even when confirmed with an oath because then we do not
deceive our neighbour but allow him to deceive himself  How can I
tell that I may not in this Pamphlet have made an accusation of the
truth of which Dr Newman is perfectly conscious but that as I a
heretic Protestant have no business to make it he has a full right to
deny it
Even if I could have found it consistent with my duty to my own
reputation to leave such an elaborate impeachment of my moral nature
unanswered my duty to my Brethren in the Catholic Priesthood would
have forbidden such a course They were involved in the charges which
this writer all along from the original passage in the Magazine to
the very last paragraph of the Pamphlet had so confidently so
pertinaciously made In exculpating myself it was plain I should be
pursuing no mere personal quarrelI was offering my humble service to
a sacred cause I was making my protest in behalf of a large body of men
of high character of honest and religious minds and of sensitive
honourwho had their place and their rights in this world though they
were ministers of the world unseen and who were insulted by my Accuser
as the above extracts from him sufficiently show not only in my person
but directly and pointedly in their own Accordingly I at once set
about writing the Apologia pro vita sua of which the present Volume
is a New Edition and it was a great reward to me to find as the
controversy proceeded such large numbers of my clerical brethren
supporting me by their sympathy in the course which I was pursuing and
as occasion offered bestowing on me the formal and public expression of
their approbation These testimonials in my behalf so important and so
grateful to me are together with the Letter sent to me with the same
purpose from my Bishop contained in the last pages of this Volume
This Edition differs from the first form of the Apologia as
followsThe original work consisted of seven Parts which were
published in series on consecutive Thursdays between April 21 and June
2 An Appendix in answer to specific allegations urged against me in
the Pamphlet of Accusation appeared on June 16 Of these Parts 1 and 2
as being for the most part directly controversial are omitted in this
Edition excepting certain passages in them which are subjoined to this
Preface as being necessary for the due explanation of the subsequent
five Parts These being 3 4 5 6 7 of the Apologia are here
numbered as Chapters 1 2 3 4 5 respectively Of the Appendix about
half has been omitted for the same reason as has led to the omission of
Parts 1 and 2 The rest of it is thrown into the shape of Notes of a
discursive character with two new ones on Liberalism and the Lives of
the English Saints of 18434 and another new in part on
Ecclesiastical Miracles In the body of the work the only addition of
consequence is the letter which is found at p 228 a copy of which has
recently come into my possession
I should add that since writing the Apologia last year I have seen for
the first time Mr Oakeleys Notes on the Tractarian Movement This
work remarkably corroborates the substance of my Narrative while the
kind terms in which he speaks of me personally call for my sincere
gratitude
May 2 1865
I make these extracts from the first edition of my Apologia Part 1 pp
3 2025 and Part 2 pp 2931 and pp 4151 in order to set before
the reader the drift I had in writing my Volume
I cannot be sorry to have forced my Accuser to bring out in
fulness his charges against me It is far better that he should
discharge his thoughts upon me in my lifetime than after I am
dead Under the circumstances I am happy in having the
opportunity of reading the worst that can be said of me by a
writer who has taken pains with his work and is well satisfied
with it I account it a gain to be surveyed from without by one
who hates the principles which are nearest to my heart has no
personal knowledge of me to set right his misconceptions of my
doctrine and who has some motive or other to be as severe with
me as he can possibly be
But I really feel sad for what I am obliged now to say I am in
warfare with him but I wish him no illit is very difficult
to get up resentment towards persons whom one has never seen It
is easy enough to be irritated with friends or foes visavis
but though I am writing with all my heart against what he has
said of me I am not conscious of personal unkindness towards
himself I think it necessary to write as I am writing for my
own sake and for the sake of the Catholic Priesthood but I
wish to impute nothing worse to him than that he has been
furiously carried away by his feelings Yet what shall I say of
the upshot of all his talk of my economies and equivocations and
the like What is the precise work which it is directed to
effect I am at war with him but there is such a thing as
legitimate warfare war has its laws there are things which may
fairly be done and things which may not be done I say it with
shame and with stern sorrowhe has attempted a great
transgression he has attempted as I may call it to poison
the wells I will quote him and explain what I mean He
says
I am henceforth in doubt and fear as much as any honest man
can be concerning every word Dr Newman may write How can I
tell that I shall not be the dupe of some cunning equivocation
of one of the three kinds laid down as permissible by the
blessed Alfonso da Liguori and his pupils even when confirmed
by an oath because then we do not deceive our neighbour but
allow him to deceive himself  It is admissible therefore
to use words and sentences which have a double signification
and leave the hapless hearer to take which of them he may
choose What proof have I then that by mean it I never said
it Dr Newman does not signify I did not say it but I did
mean itPp 44 45
Now these insinuations and questions shall be answered in their
proper places here I will but say that I scorn and detest
lying and quibbling and doubletongued practice and slyness
and cunning and smoothness and cant and pretence quite as
much as any Protestants hate them and I pray to be kept from
the snare of them But all this is just now by the bye my
present subject is my Accuser what I insist upon here is this
unmanly attempt of his in his concluding pages to cut the
ground from under my feetto poison by anticipation the public
mind against me John Henry Newman and to infuse into the
imaginations of my readers suspicion and mistrust of everything
that I may say in reply to him This I call poisoning the
wells
I am henceforth in doubt and fear he says as much as any
honest man can be concerning every word Dr Newman may
write How can I tell that I shall not be the dupe of some
cunning equivocation
Well I can only say that if his taunt is to take effect I am
but wasting my time in saying a word in answer to his calumnies
and this is precisely what he knows and intends to be its fruit
I can hardly get myself to protest against a method of
controversy so base and cruel lest in doing so I should be
violating my selfrespect and selfpossession but most base and
most cruel it is We all know how our imagination runs away with
us how suddenly and at what a pacethe saying Csars wife
should not be suspected is an instance of what I mean The
habitual prejudice the humour of the moment is the
turningpoint which leads us to read a defence in a good sense
or a bad We interpret it by our antecedent impressions
The very same sentiments according as our jealousy is or is not
awake or our aversion stimulated are tokens of truth or of
dissimulation and pretence There is a story of a sane person
being by mistake shut up in the wards of a Lunatic Asylum and
that when he pleaded his cause to some strangers visiting the
establishment the only remark he elicited in answer was How
naturally he talks you would think he was in his senses
Controversies should be decided by the reason is it legitimate
warfare to appeal to the misgivings of the public mind and to
its dislikings Any how if my accuser is able thus to practise
upon my readers the more I succeed the less will be my
success If I am natural he will tell them Ars est celare
artem if I am convincing he will suggest that I am an able
logician if I show warmth I am acting the indignant innocent
if I am calm I am thereby detected as a smooth hypocrite if I
clear up difficulties I am too plausible and perfect to be
true The more triumphant are my statements the more certain
will be my defeat
So will it be if my Accuser succeeds in his manoeuvre but I
do not for an instant believe that he will Whatever judgment my
readers may eventually form of me from these pages I am
confident that they will believe me in what I shall say in the
course of them I have no misgiving at all that they will be
ungenerous or harsh towards a man who has been so long before
the eyes of the world who has so many to speak of him from
personal knowledge whose natural impulse it has ever been to
speak out who has ever spoken too much rather than too little
who would have saved himself many a scrape if he had been wise
enough to hold his tongue who has ever been fair to the
doctrines and arguments of his opponents who has never slurred
over facts and reasonings which told against himself who has
never given his name or authority to proofs which he thought
unsound or to testimony which he did not think at least
plausible who has never shrunk from confessing a fault when he
felt that he had committed one who has ever consulted for
others more than for himself who has given up much that he
loved and prized and could have retained but that he loved
honesty better than name and Truth better than dear friends
What then shall be the special imputation against which I shall
throw myself in these pages out of the thousand and one which
my Accuser directs upon me I mean to confine myself to one for
there is only one about which I much carethe charge of
Untruthfulness He may cast upon me as many other imputations as
he pleases and they may stick on me as long as they can in
the course of nature They will fall to the ground in their
season
And indeed I think the same of the charge of Untruthfulness and
select it from the rest not because it is more formidable but
because it is more serious Like the rest it may disfigure me
for a time but it will not stain Archbishop Whately used to
say Throw dirt enough and some will stick well will stick
but not will stain I think he used to mean stain and I do
not agree with him Some dirt sticks longer than other dirt but
no dirt is immortal According to the old saying Prvalebit
Veritas There are virtues indeed which the world is not fitted
to judge of or to uphold such as faith hope and charity but
it can judge about Truthfulness it can judge about the natural
virtues and Truthfulness is one of them Natural virtues may
also become supernatural Truthfulness is such but that does
not withdraw it from the jurisdiction of mankind at large It
may be more difficult in this or that particular case for men to
take cognizance of it as it may be difficult for the Court of
Queens Bench at Westminster to try a case fairly which took
place in Hindostan but that is a question of capacity not of
right Mankind has the right to judge of Truthfulness in a
Catholic as in the case of a Protestant of an Italian or of a
Chinese I have never doubted that in my hour in Gods hour
my avenger will appear and the world will acquit me of
untruthfulness even though it be not while I live
Still more confident am I of such eventual acquittal seeing
that my judges are my own countrymen I consider indeed
Englishmen the most suspicious and touchy of mankind I think
them unreasonable and unjust in their seasons of excitement
but I had rather be an Englishman as in fact I am than
belong to any other race under heaven They are as generous as
they are hasty and burly and their repentance for their
injustice is greater than their sin
For twenty years and more I have borne an imputation of which I
am at least as sensitive who am the object of it as they can
be who are only the judges I have not set myself to remove it
first because I never have had an opening to speak and next
because I never saw in them the disposition to hear I have
wished to appeal from Philip drunk to Philip sober When shall I
pronounce him to be himself again If I may judge from the tone
of the public press which represents the public voice I have
great reason to take heart at this time I have been treated by
contemporary critics in this controversy with great fairness and
gentleness and I am grateful to them for it However the
decision of the time and mode of my defence has been taken out
of my hands and I am thankful that it has been so I am bound
now as a duty to myself to the Catholic cause to the Catholic
Priesthood to give account of myself without any delay when I
am so rudely and circumstantially charged with Untruthfulness I
accept the challenge I shall do my best to meet it and I shall
be content when I have done so
It is not my present accuser alone who entertains and has
entertained so dishonourable an opinion of me and of my
writings It is the impression of large classes of men the
impression twenty years ago and the impression now There has
been a general feeling that I was for years where I had no right
to be that I was a Romanist in Protestant livery and service
that I was doing the work of a hostile Church in the bosom of
the English Establishment and knew it or ought to have known
it There was no need of arguing about particular passages in my
writings when the fact was so patent as men thought it to be
First it was certain and I could not myself deny it that I
scouted the name Protestant It was certain again that many
of the doctrines which I professed were popularly and generally
known as badges of the Roman Church as distinguished from the
faith of the Reformation Next how could I have come by them
Evidently I had certain friends and advisers who did not
appear there was some underground communication between
Stonyhurst or Oscott and my rooms at Oriel Beyond a doubt I
was advocating certain doctrines not by accident but on an
understanding with ecclesiastics of the old religion Then men
went further and said that I had actually been received into
that religion and withal had leave given me to profess myself a
Protestant still Others went even further and gave it out to
the world as a matter of fact of which they themselves had the
proof in their hands that I was actually a Jesuit And when the
opinions which I advocated spread and younger men went further
than I the feeling against me waxed stronger and took a wider
range
And now indignation arose at the knavery of a conspiracy such as
thisand it became of course all the greater in consequence of
its being the received belief of the public at large that craft
and intrigue such as they fancied they beheld with their eyes
were the very instruments to which the Catholic Church has in
these last centuries been indebted for her maintenance and
extension
There was another circumstance still which increased the
irritation and aversion felt by the large classes of whom I
have been speaking against the preachers of doctrines so new
to them and so unpalatable and that was that they developed
them in so measured a way If they were inspired by Roman
theologians and this was taken for granted why did they not
speak out at once Why did they keep the world in such suspense
and anxiety as to what was coming next and what was to be the
upshot of the whole Why this reticence and halfspeaking and
apparent indecision It was plain that the plan of operations
had been carefully mapped out from the first and that these men
were cautiously advancing towards its accomplishment as far as
was safe at the moment that their aim and their hope was to
carry off a large body with them of the young and the ignorant
that they meant gradually to leaven the minds of the rising
generation and to open the gates of that city of which they
were the sworn defenders to the enemy who lay in ambush outside
of it And when in spite of the many protestations of the party
to the contrary there was at length an actual movement among
their disciples and one went over to Rome and then another
the worst anticipations and the worst judgments which had been
formed of them received their justification And lastly when
men first had said of me You will see he will go he is
only biding his time he is waiting the word of command from
Rome and when after all after my arguments and denunciations
of former years at length I did leave the Anglican Church for
the Roman then they said to each other It is just as we said
we knew it would be so
This was the state of mind of masses of men twenty years ago
who took no more than an external and common sense view of what
was going on And partly the tradition partly the effect of
that feeling remains to the present time Certainly I consider
that in my own case it is the great obstacle in the way of my
being favourably heard as at present when I have to make my
defence Not only am I now a member of a most unEnglish
communion whose great aim is considered to be the extinction of
Protestantism and the Protestant Church and whose means of
attack are popularly supposed to be unscrupulous cunning and
deceit but how came I originally to have any relations with the
Church of Rome at all did I or my opinions drop from the sky
how came I in Oxford in gremio Universitatis to present
myself to the eyes of men in that full blown investiture of
Popery How could I dare how could I have the conscience with
warnings with prophecies with accusations against me to
persevere in a path which steadily advanced towards which ended
in the religion of Rome And how am I now to be trusted when
long ago I was trusted and was found wanting
It is this which is the strength of the case of my Accuser
against menot the articles of impeachment which he has framed
from my writings and which I shall easily crumble into dust
but the bias of the court It is the state of the atmosphere it
is the vibration all around which will echo his bold assertion
of my dishonesty it is that prepossession against me which
takes it for granted that when my reasoning is convincing it is
only ingenious and that when my statements are unanswerable
there is always something put out of sight or hidden in my
sleeve it is that plausible but cruel conclusion to which men
are apt to jump that when much is imputed much must be true
and that it is more likely that one should be to blame than
that many should be mistaken in blaming himthese are the real
foes which I have to fight and the auxiliaries to whom my
Accuser makes his advances
Well I must break through this barrier of prejudice against me
if I can and I think I shall be able to do so When first I
read the Pamphlet of Accusation I almost despaired of meeting
effectively such a heap of misrepresentations and such a
vehemence of animosity What was the good of answering first one
point and then another and going through the whole circle of
its abuse when my answer to the first point would be forgotten
as soon as I got to the second What was the use of bringing out
half a hundred separate principles or views for the refutation
of the separate counts in the Indictment when rejoinders of
this sort would but confuse and torment the reader by their
number and their diversity What hope was there of condensing
into a pamphlet of a readable length matter which ought freely
to expand itself into half a dozen volumes What means was
there except the expenditure of interminable pages to set
right even one of that series of single passing hints to use
my Assailants own language which as with his finger tip he
had delivered against me
All those separate charges had their force in being
illustrations of one and the same great imputation He had
already a positive idea to illuminate his whole matter and to
stamp it with a force and to quicken it with an interpretation
He called me a liara simple a broad an intelligible to
the English public a plausible arraignment but for me to
answer in detail charge one by reason one and charge two by
reason two and charge three by reason three and so on through
the whole string both of accusations and replies each of which
was to be independent of the rest this would be certainly
labour lost as regards any effective result What I needed was a
corresponding antagonist unity in my defence and where was that
to be found We see in the case of commentators on the
prophecies of Scripture an exemplification of the principle on
which I am insisting viz how much more powerful even a false
interpretation of the sacred text is than none at allhow a
certain key to the visions of the Apocalypse for instance may
cling to the mind I have found it so in the case of my own
because the view which it opens on us is positive and
objective in spite of the fullest demonstration that it really
has no claim upon our reception The reader says What else can
the prophecy mean just as my Accuser asks What then does
Dr Newman mean  I reflected and I saw a way out of my
perplexity
Yes I said to myself his very question is about my meaning
What does Dr Newman mean It pointed in the very same
direction as that into which my musings had turned me already
He asks what I mean not about my words not about my
arguments not about my actions as his ultimate point but
about that living intelligence by which I write and argue and
act He asks about my Mind and its Beliefs and its sentiments
and he shall be answerednot for his own sake but for mine
for the sake of the Religion which I profess and of the
Priesthood in which I am unworthily included and of my friends
and of my foes and of that general public which consists of
neither one nor the other but of wellwishers lovers of fair
play sceptical crossquestioners interested inquirers curious
lookerson and simple strangers unconcerned yet not careless
about the issuefor the sake of all these he shall be
answered
My perplexity had not lasted half an hour I recognized what I
had to do though I shrank from both the task and the exposure
which it would entail I must I said give the true key to my
whole life I must show what I am that it may be seen what I am
not and that the phantom may be extinguished which gibbers
instead of me I wish to be known as a living man and not as a
scarecrow which is dressed up in my clothes False ideas may be
refuted indeed by argument but by true ideas alone are they
expelled I will vanquish not my Accuser but my judges I will
indeed answer his charges and criticisms on me one by one1
lest any one should say that they are unanswerable but such a
work shall not be the scope nor the substance of my reply I
will draw out as far as may be the history of my mind I will
state the point at which I began in what external suggestion or
accident each opinion had its rise how far and how they
developed from within how they grew were modified were
combined were in collision with each other and were changed
again how I conducted myself towards them and how and how far
and for how long a time I thought I could hold them
consistently with the ecclesiastical engagements which I had
made and with the position which I held I must showwhat is
the very truththat the doctrines which I held and have held
for so many years have been taught me speaking humanly partly
by the suggestions of Protestant friends partly by the teaching
of books and partly by the action of my own mind and thus I
shall account for that phenomenon which to so many seems so
wonderful that I should have left my kindred and my fathers
house for a Church from which once I turned away with
dreadso wonderful to them as if forsooth a Religion which
has flourished through so many ages among so many nations amid
such varieties of social life in such contrary classes and
conditions of men and after so many revolutions political and
civil could not subdue the reason and overcome the heart
without the aid of fraud in the process and the sophistries of
the schools
1 This was done in the Appendix of which the more important
parts are preserved in the Notes
What I had proposed to myself in the course of halfanhour I
determined on at the end of ten days However I have many
difficulties in fulfilling my design How am I to say all that
has to be said in a reasonable compass And then as to the
materials of my narrative I have no autobiographical notes to
consult no written explanations of particular treatises or of
tracts which at the time gave offence hardly any minutes of
definite transactions or conversations and few contemporary
