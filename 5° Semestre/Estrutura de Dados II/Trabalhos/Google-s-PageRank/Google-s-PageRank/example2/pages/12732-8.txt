MARKHEIM 1884 Robert Louis Stevenson
INTRODUCTION
HISTORY OF THE SHORTSTORY
Just when where and by whom storytelling was begun no one can say
From the first use of speech no doubt our ancestors have told
stories of war love mysteries and the miraculous performances of
lower animals and inanimate objects The ultimate source of all
stories lies in a thorough democracy unhampered by the restrictions
of a higher civilization Many tales spring from a loathsome filth
that is extremely obnoxious to our present day tastes The remarkable
and gratifying truth is however that the shortstory beginning in
the crude and brutal stages of mans development has gradually
unfolded to greater and more useful possibilities until in our own
time it is a most flexible and moral literary form
The first historical evidence in the development of the story shows no
conception of a shortstory other than that it is not so long as other
narratives This judgment of the shortstory obtained until the
beginning of the nineteenth century when a new version of its meaning
was given and an enlarged vision of its possibilities was experienced
by a number of writers almost simultaneously In the early centuries
of storytelling there was only one purpose in mindthat of narrating
for the joy of the telling and hearing The storytellers sacrificed
unity and totality of effect as well as originality for an
entertaining method of reciting their incidents
The story of Ruth and the Prodigal Son are excellent short tales
but they do not fulfill the requirements of our modern shortstory for
the reason that they are not constructed for one single impression
but are in reality parts of possible longer stories They are as it
were parts of stories not unlike Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and A
Lear of the Steppes and lack those complete and concise artistic
effects found in the shortstories Markheim and Mumu by the same
authors Both Ruth and the Prodigal Son are exceptionally well
told possess a splendid moral tone and are excellent prophecies of
what the nineteenth century has developed for us in the art of
shortstory writing
The Greeks did very little writing in prose until the era of their
decadence and showed little instinct to use the concise and unified
form of the shortstory The conquering Romans followed closely in the
paths of their predecessors and did little work in the shorter
narratives The myths of Greece and Rome were not bound by facts and
opened a wonderland where writers were free to roam The epics were
slow in movement and presented a list of loosely organized stories
arranged about some character like Ulysses or AEneas
During the mediaeval period storytellers and stories appeared
everywhere The more ignorant of these storytellers produced the
fable and the educated monks produced the simple crude and
disjointed tales The Gesta Romanorum is a wonderful storehouse of
these mediaeval stories In the Decameron Boccaccio deals with
traditional and contemporary materials He is a born storyteller and
presents many interesting and welltold narratives but as Professor
Baldwin1 has said more than half are merely anecdotes and the
remaining stories are bare plots ingeniously done in a kind of
scenario form Three approach our modern idea of the shortstory and
two the second story of the second day and the sixth story of the
ninth day actually attain to our standard Boccaccio was not
conscious of a standard in shortstory telling for he had none in the
sense that Poe and Maupassant defined and practiced it Chaucer in
England told his stories in verse and added the charm of humor and
well defined characters to the development of storytelling
In the seventeenth century Cervantes gave the world its first great
novel Don Quixote Cervantes was careless in his work and did not
write shortstories but tales that are fairly brief Spain added to
the story a high sense of chivalry and a richness of character that
the Greek romance and the Italian novella did not possess France
followed this loose composition and lack of beauty in form Scarron
and Le Sage the two French fiction writers of this period
contributed little or nothing to the advancement of storytelling
Cervantes The Liberal Lover is as near as this period came to
producing a real shortstory
The storytelling of the seventeenth century was largely shaped by the
popularity of the drama In the eighteenth century the drama gave
place to the essay and it is to the sketch and essay that we must go
to trace the evolution of the story during this period Voltaire in
France had a burning message in every essay and he paid far greater
attention to the development of the thought of his message than to the
story he was telling Addison and Steele in the Spectator developed
some real characters of the fiction type and told some good stories
but even their best like Theodosius and Constantia fall far short
of developing all the dramatic possibilities and lack the focusing of
interest found in the nineteenth century stories Some of Lambs
Essays of Elia especially the Dream Children introduce a
delicate fancy and an essayists clearness of thought and statement
into the story At the close of this century German romanticism began
to seep into English thought and prepare the way for things new in
literary thought and treatment
The nineteenth century opened with a decided preference for fiction
Washington Irving reverting to the Spectator produced his
sketches and following the trend of his time looked forward to a
new form and wrote The Spectre Bridegroom and Rip Van Winkle It
is only by a precise definition of shortstory that Irving is robbed
of the honor of being the founder of the modern shortstory He loved
to meander and to fit his materials to his story scheme in a leisurely
manner He did not quite see what Hawthorne instinctively followed and
Poe consciously defined and practiced and he did not realize that
terseness of statement and totality of impression were the chief
qualities he needed to make him the father of a new literary form Poe
and Maupassant have reduced the form of the shortstory to an exact
science Hawthorne and Harte have done successfully in the field of
romanticism what the Germans Tieck and Hoffman did not do so well
Bjornson and Henry James have analyzed character psychologically in
their shortstories Kipling has used the shortstory as a vehicle for
the conveyance of specific knowledge Stevenson has gathered most if
not all of the literary possibilities adaptable to shortstory use
and has incorporated them in his Markheim
France with her literary newspapers and artistic tendencies and the
United States with magazines calling incessantly for good
shortstories and with every section of its conglomerate life
clamoring to express itself lead in the production and rank of
shortstories Maupassant and Stevenson and Hawthorne and Poe are the
great names in the ranks of shortstory writers The list of present
day writers is interminable and high school students can best acquire
a reasonable appreciation of the great work these writers are doing by
reading regularly some of the better grade literary magazines

development of the shortstory students should have access to Brander

QUALITIES OF THE SHORTSTORY
It was not until well along in the nineteenth century that any one
attempted to define the shortstory The three quotations given here
are among the best things that have been spoken on this subject
The right novella is never a novel cropped back from the size of a
tree to a bush or the branch of a tree stuck into the ground and made
to serve for a bush It is another species destined by the agencies
at work in the realm of unconsciousness to be brought into being of
its own kind and not of anotherWD Howells North American
Review 173429
A true shortstory is something other and something more than a mere
story which is short A true shortstory differs from the novel
chiefly in its essential unity of impression In a far more exact and
precise use of the word a shortstory has unity as a novel cannot
have it A shortstory deals with a single character a single
event a single emotion or the series of emotions called forth by a
single situationBrander Matthews The Philosophy of the
ShortStory
The aim of a shortstory is to produce a single narrative effect with
the greatest economy of means that is consistent with the utmost
emphasisClayton Hamilton Materials and Methods of Fiction
The shortstory must always have a compact unity and a direct
simplicity In such stories as Bjornsons The Father and
Maupassants The Piece of String this simplicity is equal to that of
the anecdote but in no case can an anecdote possess the dramatic
possibilities of these simple shortstories for a shortstory must
always have that tensity of emotion that comes only in the crucial
tests of life
The shortstory does not demand the consistency in treatment of the
long story for there are not so many elements to marshal and direct
properly but the shortstory must be original and varied in its
themes cleverly constructed and lighted through and through with the
glow of vivid imaginings A single incident in daily life is caught as
in a snapshot exposure and held before the reader in such a manner
that the impression of the whole is derived largely from suggestion
The single incident may be the turningpoint in life history as in
The Man Who Was it may be a mental surrender of habits fixed
seemingly in indelible colors in the soul and a sudden inflexible
decision to be a man as in the case of Markheim or it may be a
gradual realization of the value of spiritual gifts as Bjornson has
concisely presented it in his little story The Father
The aim of the shortstory is always to present a crosssection of
life in such a vivid manner that the importance of the incident
becomes universal Some shortstories are told with the definite end
in view of telling a story for the sake of exploiting a plot The
Cask of Amontillado is all action in comparison with The Masque of
the Red Death The GoldBug sets for itself the task of solving a
puzzle and possesses action from first to last Other stories teach a
moral Ethan Brand deals with the unpardonable sin and The Great
Stone Face is our classic story in the field of ideals and their
development Hawthorne above all writers is most interested in
ethical laws and moral development Still other stories aim to portray
character Miss Jewett and Mrs Freeman veraciously picture the
fadedput womanhood in New England Henry James and Bjornson turn the
xrays of psychology and sociology on their characters Stevenson
follows with the precision of the tick of a watch the steps in
Markheims mental evolution
The types of the shortstory are as varied as life itself Addison
Lamb Irving Warner and many others have used the story in their
sketches and essays with wonderful effect The Legend of Sleepy
Hollow is as impressive as any of Scotts tales The allegory in The
Great Stone Face loses little or nothing when compared with Bunyans
Pilgrims Progress No better type of detective story has been
written than the two shortstories The Murders in the Rue Morgue
and The Purloined Letter Every emotion is subject to the call of
the shortstory Humor with its expansive free air is not so well
adapted to the shortstory as is pathos There is a sadness in the
stories of Dickens Garland Page Mrs Freeman Miss Jewett
Maupassant Poe and many others that runs the whole gamut from
pleasing tenderness in A Childs Dream of a Star to unutterable
horror in The Fall of the House of Usher
The shortstory is stripped of all the incongruities that led
Fielding Scott and Dickens far afield All its parts harmonize in
the simplest manner to give unity and totality of impression through
strict unity of form It is a concentrated piece of life snatched from
the ordinary and uneventful round of living and steeped in fancy until
it becomes the acme of literary art
COMPOSITION OF THE SHORTSTORY
Any student who wishes to express himself correctly and pleasingly
and desires a keener sense for the appreciation of literary work must
write The way others have done the thing never appears in a forceful
light until one sets himself at a task of like nature Just so in the
study of this text To find and appreciate the better points of the
shortstory students must write stories of their own patterned in a
small way on the technique of the masterpieces
The process of shortstory writing follows in a general way the
following program In the first place the class must have something
interesting and suggestive to write about Sometimes the class can
suggest a subject newspapers almost every day give incidents worthy
of story treatment happenings in the community often give the very
best material for stories and phases of the literature work may well
be used in the development of students themes Change the type of
character and place reconstruct the plot or require a different
ending for the story leaving the plot virtually as it is and then
assign to the class Boys and girls should invariably be taught to see
stories in the life about them in the newspapers and magazines on
their library tables and in the masterpieces they study in their
class work
After the idea that the class wishes to develop has been definitely
determined and the material for this development has been gathered and
grouped about the idea the class should select a viewpoint and
proceed to write Sometimes the author should tell the story
sometimes a third person who may be of secondary importance in the
story should be given the role of the storyteller sometimes the
whole may be in dialogue The class should choose a fitting method
Young writers should be very careful about the beginning of a story
An action story should start with a striking incident that catches the
readers attention at once and forecasts subsequent happenings In
every case this first incident must have in it the essence of the end
of the story and should be perfectly logical to the reader after he
has finished the reading A story in which the setting is emphasized
can well begin with a description and contain a number of
descriptions and expositions distributed with a sense of propriety
throughout the theme A good method to use in the opening of a
character story is that of conversation An excellent example of a
sharp use of this device is Mrs Freemans Revolt of Mother where
the first paragraph is a single spoken word
Every incident included in the story should be tested for its value in
the development of the theme An incident that does not amplify
certain phases of the story has no right to be included and great
care should be used in an effort to incorporate just the material
necessary for the proper evolution of the thought The problem is not
so much what can be secured to be included in the story but rather
after making a thorough collection of the material what of all these
points should be cast out
The ending must be a natural outgrowth of the development found in the
body of the composition Even in a story with a surprise ending of
which we are tempted to say that we have had no preparation for such a
turn in the story there must be hintsthe subtler the betterthat
point unerringly and always toward the end The end is presupposed in
the beginning and the changing of one means the altering of the other
Young writers have trouble in stopping at the right place They should
learn as soon as possible that to drag on after the logical ending
has been reached spoils the best of stories It is just as bad to stop
before arriving at the true end In other words there is only one
place for the ending of a story and in no case can it be shifted
without ruining the idea that has obtained throughout the theme
There are certain steps in the development of storywriting that
should be followed if the best results are to be obtained The first
assignment should require only the writing of straight narrative The
Arabian Nights Tales and childrens stories represent this type of
writing and will give the teacher valuable aid in the presentation of
this work After the students have produced simple stories resembling
the Sinbad Voyages they should next add descriptions of persons and
places and explanations of situations to develop clearness and
interest in their original productions Taking these themes in turn
students should be required to introduce plot incidents that
complicate the simple happenings and divert the straightforward trend
of the narrative Now that the stories are well developed in their
descriptions expositions and plot interests they should be tested
for their emotional effects Students should go through their themes
and by making the proper changes give in some cases a humorous and in
others a pathetic or tragic effect These few suggestions are given to
emphasize the facts that no one conceives a story in all its details
in a moment of inspiration and that there is a way of proceeding that
passes in logical gradations from the simplest to the most complex
phases of story writing
Franklin and Stevenson knew no rules for writing other than to
practice incessantly on some form they wished to imitate Hard work is
the first lesson that boys and girls must learn in the art of writing
and a systematic gradation of assignments is what the teacher must
provide for his students Walter Besant gave the following rules for
novel writers Some of them may be suggestive to writers of the high
school age so the list is given in its complete form 1 Practice
writing something original every day 2 Cultivate the habit of
observation 3 Work regularly at certain hours 4 Read no rubbish
5 Aim at the formation of style 6 Endeavor to be dramatic 7 A
great element of dramatic skill is selection 8 Avoid the sin of
writing about a character 9 Never attempt to describe any kind of
life except that with which you are familiar 10 Learn as much as
you can about men and women 11 For the sake of forming a good
natural style and acquiring command of language write poetry

THE FATHER1
By Bjornstjerne Bjornson 18381910
The man whose story is here to be told was the wealthiest and most
influential person in his parish his name was Thord Overaas He
appeared in the priests study one day tall and earnest
I have gotten a son said he and I wish to present him for
baptism
What shall his name be
Finnafter my father
And the sponsors
They were mentioned and proved to be the best men and women of
Thords relations in the parish
Is there anything else inquired the priest and looked up The
peasant hesitated a little
I should like very much to have him baptized by himself said he
finally
That is to say on a weekday
Next Saturday at twelve oclock noon
Is there anything else inquired the priest
There is nothing else and the peasant twirled his cap as though he
were about to go
Then the priest rose There is yet this however said he and
walking toward Thord he took him by the hand and looked gravely into
his eyes God grant that the child may become a blessing to you
One day sixteen years later Thord stood once more in the priests
study
Really you carry your age astonishingly well Thord said the
priest for he saw no change whatever in the man
That is because I have no troubles replied Thord To this the
priest said nothing but after a while he asked What is your
pleasure this evening
I have come this evening about that son of mine who is to be
confirmed tomorrow
He is a bright boy
I did not wish to pay the priest until I heard what number the boy
would have when he takes his place in the church tomorrow
He will stand number one
So I have heard and here are ten dollars for the priest
Is there anything else I can do for you inquired the priest fixing
his eyes on Thord
There is nothing else
Thord went out
Eight years more rolled by and then one day a noise was heard outside
of the priests study for many men were approaching and at their
head was Thord who entered first
The priest looked up and recognized him
You come well attended this evening Thord said he
I am here to request that the banns may be published for my son he
is about to marry Karen Storliden daughter of Gudmund who stands
here beside me
Why that is the richest girl in the parish
So they say replied the peasant stroking back his hair with one
hand
The priest sat a while as if in deep thought then entered the names
in his book without making any comments and the men wrote their
signatures underneath Thord laid three dollars on the table
One is all I am to have said the priest
I know that very well but he is my only child I want to do it
handsomely
The priest took the money
This is now the third time Thord that you have come here on your
sons account
But now I am through with him said Thord and folding up his
pocketbook he said farewell and walked away
The men slowly followed him
A fortnight later the father and son were rowing across the lake one
calm still day to Storliden to make arrangements for the wedding
This thwart2 is not secure said the son and stood up to
straighten the seat on which he was sitting
At the same moment the board he was standing on slipped from under
him he threw out his arms uttered a shriek and fell overboard
Take holdof the oar shouted the father springing to his feet and
holding out the oar
But when the son had made a couple of efforts he grew stiff
Wait a moment cried the father and began to row toward his son
Then the son rolled over on his back gave his father one long look
and sank
Thord could scarcely believe it he held the boat still and stared at
the spot where his son had gone down as though he must surely come to
the surface again There rose some bubbles then some more and
finally one large one that burst and the lake lay there as smooth and
bright as a mirror again
For three days and three nights people saw the father rowing round and
round the spot without taking either food or sleep he was dragging
the lake for the body of his son And toward morning of the third day
he found it and carried it in his arms up over the hills to his
gard3
It might have been about a year from that day when the priest late
one autumn evening heard some one in the passage outside of the door
carefully trying to find the latch The priest opened the door and in
walked a tall thin man with bowed form and white hair The priest
looked long at him before he recognized him It was Thord
Are you out walking so late said the priest and stood still in
front of him
Ah yes it is late said Thord and took a seat
The priest sat down also as though waiting A long long silence
followed At last Thord said
I have something with me that I should like to give to the poor I
want it to be invested as a legacy in my sons name
He rose laid some money on the table and sat down again The priest
counted it
It is a great deal of money said he
It is half the price of my gard I sold it today
The priest sat long in silence At last he asked but gently
What do you propose to do now Thord
Something better
They sat there for a while Thord with downcast eyes the priest with
his eyes fixed on Thord Presently the priest said slowly and
softly
I think your son has at last brought you a true blessing
Yes I think so myself said Thord looking up while two big tears
coursed slowly down his cheeks

BIOGRAPHY
Bjornstjerne Bjornson Norse poet novelist dramatist orator and
political leader was born December 8 1832 and died in Paris April
26 1910 From his strenuous father a Lutheran priest who preached
with tongue and fist he inherited the physique of a Norse god He
possessed the mind of a poet and the arm of a warrior At the age of
twelve he was sent to the Molde grammar school where he proved
himself a very dull student In 1852 ho entered the university in
Christiana Here he neglected his studies to write poetry and
journalistic articles
In politics Bjornson was a tremendous force Dr Brandes has said To
speak the name of Bjornson is like hoisting the colors of Norway He
was honored as a king in his native land He won this recognition by
no party affiliation but by his natural gifts as a poet His magnetic
eloquence great message and sterling character compelled his
countrymen to follow and honor him He says of his success in this
field The secret with me is that in success as in failure in the
consciousness of my doing as in my habits I am myself There are a
great many who dare not or lack the ability to be themselves For
his views on political issues the following references may well be
used Independent January 31 1901 pp 253257 Current
Literature November 1906 p 581 and Independent July 13 1905

Bjornson and Ibsen the two foremost men of Norway were very closely
associated throughout life They were schoolmates and both were
interested in writing and producing plays Ibsens son Dr Sigurd
Ibsen married Bjornsons daughter Bergilot These two great writers
were direct contrasts in nearly everything Bjornson lived among his
people Ibsen was reserved Bjornson played the role of an optimistic
prophet Ibsen that of a pessimistic judge the former was always a
conciliatory spirit the latter a revolutionist and Bjornson proved
himself a patriotic Norwegian Ibsen a man of the entire world
Lack of space forbids the inclusion of a list of Bjornsons writings
High school teachers will find suitable selections in the list of
collateral readings that follows Those who wish a complete
bibliography of his works will find it in Bookman Volume II p 65
Translations of his works by Rasmus B Anderson Houghton Mifflin Co
and Edmund Gosse the Macmillan Co will furnish students extensive
and standard readings of this master storyteller
CRITICISMS
Bjornson in his masterly character delineations seldom produces
portraits He gives the reader suggestive glimpses often enough and of
the right quality and arrangement to produce a full and vigorous
conception of his characters His female parts are especially well
done His characters present themselves to the reader by unique
thinking and choice expressions Students should analyze The Father
for this phase of character building Note also the simplicity of the
