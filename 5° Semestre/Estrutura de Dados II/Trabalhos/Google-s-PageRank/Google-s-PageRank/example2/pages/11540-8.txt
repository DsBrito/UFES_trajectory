interested in the cultivation of Botany and who may regard the
employments of Horticulture with disdain may still be induced to
frequent the Botanical garden for the beauty of the objects the
pleasures of the society and the animating gaiety of the scene
1 How pleasingly is the substance of these observations embodied
in one of our Snatches from Eugene AramIt has been
observed and there is a world of homely ay of legislative
wisdom in the observation that wherever you see a flower in a
cottage garden or a bird at the window you may feel sure that
the cottagers are better and wiser than their neighbours Vol i
p 4 Yet with what wretched taste is this morality sought to be
perverted in an abusive notice of Mr Bulwers Eugene Aram in
a Magazine of the past month by a reference to Clark and Arams
stealing flowerroots from gentlemens gardens to add to the
ornaments of their own The writer might as well have said that
Clark and Aram were fair specimens of the whole human race or
that every gay flower in a cottage garden has been so stolen
The Manchester Garden we should think must by this time have an
Edenlike appearance The Committee began fortunately Mr Loudon in
one of his valuable Gardening Tours2 refers to a few traits of
liberality in the parties connected with it the noble result as we
think of the influence of commercial prosperity in liberalizing the
mind Mr Trafford the owner of the ground offered it for whatever
price the Committee chose to give for it The Committee took it at its
value to a common farmer and obtained a lease of the 16 acres 10
Lancashire for 99 years renewable for ever at 120l a year He
describes the donations of trees plants and books by surrounding
gentlemen as very liberal Mr Loudon does not altogether approve of
the plan and certainly by no means of the manner in which the Garden
has been planted yet he has no doubt it will contribute materially to
the spread of improved varieties of culinary vegetables and fruits
and to the education of a superior description of gardeners He
commends the hothouses which have been executed at Birmingham
especially the manner in which Mr Jones has heated the houses by hot
water though a number of the garden committee were at first very much
against this mode of heating Mr Mowbray who planned the Garden
informed us that last winter the man could make up the fires for the
night at five oclock without needing to look at them again till the
following morning at eight or nine The houses were always kept as
hot as could be wished and might have been kept at 100 if thought
necessary A young gardener who had been accustomed to sit up half
the night during winter to keep up the fires to the smoke flues
elsewhere was overcome with delight when he came here and found how
easy the task of foreman of the houses was likely to prove to him as
far as concerned the fires and nightwork
2 Gardeners Magazine No XXXIII August 1831
As a means of social improvement a feature of public interest we
hope always to be identified with The Mirror we need scarcely add
our commendation of the design of the Botanic Garden at Manchester
and similar establishments in other large towns of Britain What can
be a more delightful relaxation to a Lancashire Mechanic than an hour
or two in a Garden what an escape from the pestiferous politics of
the times At Birmingham too there is a Public Garden similar to
that at Manchester where we hope the Artisan may enjoy a sight at
least of natures gladdening beauties
In the suburbs of our great metropolis matters are not so well
managed though Mr Loudon we think proposes to unite a Botanic with
the Zoological Gardens Folks in London must study botany on their
windowsills The wealthy do not encourage it Their love of the
country is confined to the forced luxuries of kitchengardens
conveyed to them in wickerbaskets and a few hundred exotics hired
from a florist to furnish a mimic conservatory for an evening rout
They shun her gardens and fields but as Allan Cunningham pleasantly
remarks in his Life of Bonington Her loveliness and varieties are
not to be learned elsewhere than in her lap He will know little of
birds who studies them stuffed in the museum and less of the rose and
the lily who never saw anything but artificial nosegays3

TO A SNOWDROP
A Translation
For the Mirror
First and fairest of flowery visiterthrough the dark winter I
have dreamed of thy paleness and thy purityyoungest sister of the
lilylikelier thou art to be loved for thine own sake Can so
delicate a thing spring from an Earthly bed or art thou indeed
fallen from the heavens as a Snowdrop Thus I pluck thee from thy
clayey abode in which like some of us mortals thou wouldst find an
early grave I place thee in my bosom oh that it were half so pure
as thou and there shalt thou die Thou comest like a pure spirit
rising from thy earthly home unsullied and unknown No longer a child
of the dust thou steppest forth almost too delicately attired at
such a season as this Ye winds of heaven breathe on it gently
Ye showers descend on my Snowdrop with the tenderness of dew Little
flower I love thy look of unpretending innocence thou art the child
of simplicity Thou art a flower even though colourless Wert thou
never gay as others Where are the hues thou once didst wear Hast
thou lent them to the rainbow or to gay and gaudy flowers or why
so pale Dost thou fear the winters wind Canst thou survive the
snowstorm Tell me dost thou sleep by starlight or revel with
midnight fairies My Snowdrop I pity thee for thou art a lonely
flower Why camest thou out so early and wouldst not tarry for thy
more cautious springtime companions Yet thou knowest not fear fair
maiden of February Thou art bold to come out on such a morning and
friendless too It must be true as they tell me that thou wert once
an icicle and the breath of some fairys lips warmed thee into a
flower Indeed thou lookest a frail and fairy thing and thou wilt not
sojourn with us long therefore it is I make much of thee Too soon
ah too soon will thy graceful form droop and die yet shall the
memory of my Snowdrop be sweet while memory lasts I know not that I
shall live to see thy drooping head another year A thousand flowers
with a thousand hues will follow after thee but I will not I will
not forget thee my Snowdrop
MAJOR CONVOLVULUS
OUR LADYS CHAPEL SOUTHWARK
It may not plainly appear to some readers that our Engraving of this
fine vestige of ancient art is from a View taken in the year 1818
The Bishops Chapel which is there shown was demolished about twelve
months since at whose bidding we know not perhaps of the same party
who now contend for the destruction of the Lady Chapel
By the way we referred to the Altar Screen of which we now find the
following memorandum in a History of St Saviours Church published
in 17954
Anno 1618 15 Jac I
The screen at the entrance to the chapel of the Virgin Mary was
this year set up
In the same work occur the particulars of the repairs of the Lady
Chapel in 1624
Anno 1624 21 Jac I
The chapel of the Virgin Mary was restored to the parishioners
being let out to bakers for above sixty years before and 200l
laid out in the repair Of which we preserve the following extract
from Stowe
But passing all these some what now of that part of this church
above the chancell that in former times was called Our Ladies
Chappell
It is now called the New Chappell and indeed though very old
it now may be called a new one because newly redeemed from such
use and imployment as in respect of that it was built to divine
and religious duties may very well be branded with the style of
wretched base and unworthy for that that before this abuse
was and is now a faire and beautifull chappell by those that
were then the corporation which is a body consisting of thirty
vestrymen six of those thirty churchwardens was leased and let
out and the house of God made a bakehouse
Two very faire doores that from the two side iles of the
chancell of this church and two that thorow the head of the
chancell as at this day they doe againe went into it were
latht daubd and damd up the faire pillars were ordinary
posts against which they piled billets and bavens in this place
they had their ovens in that a bolting place in that their
kneading trough in another I have heard a hogstrough for the
words that were given mee were these this place have I knowne
a hogstie in another a store house to store up their hoorded
meal and in all of it something of this sordid kind and
condition It was first let by the corporation afore named to
one Wyat after him to one Peacocke after him to one
Cleybrooke and last to one Wilson all bakers and this
chappell still imployed in the way of their trade a bakehouse
though some part of this bakehouse was some time turned into a
starchhouse
The time of the continuance of it in this kind from the first
letting of it to Wyat to the restoring of it again to the church
was threescore and some odde yeeres in the yeere of our Lord God
1624 for in this yeere the ruines and blasted estate that the
old corporation sold it to were by the corporation of this time
repaired renewed well and very worthily beautified the charge
of it for that yeere with many things done to it since arising
to two hundred pounds
This as all the former repairs being the sole cost and charge
of the parishioners
4 By MM Concanen jun and A Morgan
A correspondent EE inquires how it happens that the Chapel of St
Mary Magdalen shown in all old plans of the Church has likewise
disappeared within the present century This Chapel adjoined the
South transept and was removed during the repairs under the able
superintendence of Mr Gwilt It was thus described by Mr Nightingale
in 1818
The chapel itself is a very plain erection It is entered on the
south through a large pair of folding doors leading down a
small flight of steps The ceiling has nothing peculiar in its
character nor are the four pillars supporting the roof and
the unequal arches leading into the south aisle in the least
calculated to convey any idea of grandeur or feeling of
veneration These arches have been cut through in a very clumsy
manner so that scarcely any vestige of the ancient church of St
Mary Magdalen now remains A small doorway and windows however
are still visible at the east end of this chapel the west end
formerly opened into the south transept but that also is now
walled up except a part which leads to the gallery there There
are in different parts niches which once held the holy water by
which the pious devotees of former ages sprinkled their foreheads
on their entrance before the altar I am not aware that any other
remains of the old church are now visible in this chapel Passing
through the eastern end of the south aisle a pair of gates leads
into the Virgin Marys Chapel
From what we remember of the character of this Chapel the lovers of
architecture have little to lament in its removal Our Correspondent
EE addsThis and not the Lady Chapel it was No 456 of The
Mirror that contained the gravestone of one Bishop Wickham who
however was not the famous builder of Windsor Castle in the time
of Edward III but died in 1595 the same year in which he was
translated from the see of Lincoln to that of Winchester His
gravestone now lying exposed in the churchyard marks the southeast
corner of the site of the aforesaid Magdalen Chapel
SCOTTISH ECONOMY
SHAVINGS V COAL AND PEAT
To the Editor
Without intending to be angry permit me to inform your wellmeaning
correspondent MLB that his observations on the inhabitants of
Auld Reekie are something like the subject of his communication
Shavings rather superficial
Improvidence forms no feature in the Scottish character but your
flying tourist charges the gude folk o Embro with monstrous
extravagance in making bonfires of their carpenters chips and
proceeds to reflect in the true spirit of civilization how much better
it would have been if the builders chips had been used in lighting
household fires to the obviously great saving of bundlewood than to
have thus wantonly forced them to waste their gases on the desert air
But your traveller forgot that in countries which abound in wheat rye
is seldom eaten and that on the same principle in Scotland where
coal and peat are abundant the natives like the ancient Vestals
never allow their fires to go out but keep them burning through the
whole night The business of the gude man is immediately before
going to bed to load the fire with coals and crown the supply with
a canny passack o turf which keeps the whole in a state of gentle
combustion when in the morning a sturdy thrust from the poker
produces an instantaneous blaze But unfortunately should any
untoward oernight clishmaclaver occasion the neglect of this duty
and the fire be left like envy to feed upon its own vitals a remedy
is at hand in the shape of a pan o live coals from some more
provident neighbour resident in an upper or lower flat and thus
without bundlewood or shavings is the mischief cured
I hope that this explanation will sufficiently vindicate my Scottish
friends from MLBs aspersion Scotchmen improvident never for
workhouses are as scarce among them as bundlewood or intelligent
travellers Recollect that I am not in a passion but this I will say
though the gorge choke me that MLB strongly reminds me of the
French princess who when she heard of some manufacturers dying in the
provinces of starvation said Poor fools die of starvationif I
were them I would eat bread and cheese first
The next time MLB visits Scotland let him ask the first peasant
he meets how to keep eggs fresh for years and he will answer rub a
little oil or butter over them within a day or two after laying and
they will keep any length of time perfectly fresh This discovery
which was made in France by the great Reamur depends for its success
upon the oil filling up the pores of the eggshell and thereby
cutting off the perspiration between the fluids of the egg and
the atmosphere which is a necessary agent in putrefaction The
preservation of eggs in this manner has long been practised in all
braid Scotland but it is not so much as known in our own boasted
land of stale eggs and bundlewood
In Edinburgh I mean the Scottish and not the Irish capital MLB
may actually eat new laid eggs a year old How is it that this
great comfort is not practised in the navy The Scotch have also a
hundred other domestic practices for the saving of the hard earned
siller and are far from the commission of any such idle waste as
MLBs story exhibits SS
PS Tinderboxes are unknown in Scotland and I am sure MLB if
he wants a business would as readily make his fortune by selling them
as the Yorkshireman who went to the West Indies with a cargo of great
coats

ON MY FORTYNINTH BIRTHDAY
For the Mirror
On the slope of Lifes decline
The landmark reached of fortynine
Thoughtful on this heart of mine
Strikes the sound of fortynine
Greyish hairs with brown combine
To note Times handand fortynine
Sunny hours that used to shine
Shadow oer at fortynine
Of youthful sports the joys decline
Symptoms strong of fortynine
The dance I willingly resign
To lighter heels than fortynine
Yet why anxiously repine
Pleasures wait on fortynine
Social pleasuresjoys benign
Still are found at fortynine
With a friend to go and dine
What better age than fortynine
Ladies with me sip their wine
Though they know Im fortynine
Tea and chat and wit combine
To enliven musing fortynine
Let harmony its chords untwine
Music charms at forty nine
Oer wasting care let croakers whine
Care well defy at fortynine
Fifty shall not make me pine
Why lament oer fortynine
Joys lets trace of Auld Lang Syne
Memorys fresh at fortynine
Then fill a cup of rosy wine
And drink a health to FORTYNINE

SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS
PHILOSOPHY OF LONDON
The Quadrant
The principle of suum cuique is felicitously enforced in that
ostentatious but rather heavy piece of architecture the Regent
Quadrant the pillars of which exhibit from time to time different
colours according to the fancy of the shopowners to whose premises
respectively they happen to belong Thus Mr Figgins chooses to see
his side of a pillar painted a pale chocolate while his neighbour
Mrs Hopkins insists on disguising the other half with a coat of light
cream colour or haply a delicate shade of Dutch pink so that the
identity of material which made it so hard for Transfer in Zeluco
to distinguish between his metal Venus and Vulcan is often the only
incident that the two moieties have in common
Squares
The few squares that existed in London antecedent to 1770 were rather
sheepwalks paddocks and kitchen gardens than any thing else
Grosvenor Square in particular fenced round with a rude wooden
railing which was interrupted by lumpish brick piers at intervals of
every halfdozen yards partook more of the character of a pond than
a parterre and as for Hanover Square it had very much the air of a
sorry cowyard where blackguards were to be seen assembled daily
playing at husselcap up to their ankles in mire Cavendish Square was
then for the first time dignified with a statue in the modern uniform
of the Guards mounted on a charger a lantique richly gilt and
burnished and Red Lion Square elegantly so called from the sign of
an aleshop at the corner presented the anomalous appendages of two
illconstructed watchhouses at either end with an ungainly naked
obelisk in the centre which by the by was understood to be the
site of Oliver Cromwells reinterment St Jamess Park abounded in
appletrees which Pepys mentions having laid under contribution by
stealth while Charles and his queen were actually walking within
sight of him The quaint style of this old writer is sometimes not a
little entertaining He mentions having seen MajorGeneral Harrison
hanged drawn and quartered at CharingCross he Harrison looking
as cheerful as any man could in that condition He also gravely
informs us that Sir Henry Vane when about to be beheaded on Tower
Hill urgently requested the executioner to take off his head so as
not to hurt a seton which happened to be uncicatrized in his neck
Modern Building
We are the contemporaries of a streetbuilding generation but the
grand maxim of the nineteenth century in their management of masonry
as in almost every thing else as far as we can discover appears to
lie in that troublesome line of Macbeths soliloquy ending with
twere well it were done quickly It is notorious that many of the
leases of new dwellinghouses contain a clause against dancing lest
the premises should suffer from a mazurka tremble at a gallopade or
fall prostrate under the inflictions of the parsons farewell or
the wind that shakes the barley The system of building or rather
running up a house first and afterwards providing it with a false
exterior meant to deceive the eye with the semblance of curved stone
is in itself an absolute abomination Besides Greek architecture so
magnificent when on a large scale becomes perfectly ridiculous when
applied to a private streetmansion or a haberdashers warehouse St
Pauls Church CoventGarden is an instance of the unhappy effect
produced by a combination of a similar kind great in all its parts
with its original littleness it very nearly approximates to the
character of a barn Inigo Jones doubtless desired to erect an edifice
of stately Roman aspect but he was cramped in his design
and therefore only aspired to make a firstrate barn so far
unquestionably the great architect has succeeded Then looking to
those details of London architecture which appear more peculiarly
connected with the dignity of the nation what can we say of it
but that the King of Great Britain is worse lodged than the chief
magistrate of Claris or Zug while the debates of the most powerful
assembly in the world are carried on in a building or a return to
Westminster Hall which will bear no comparison with the Stadthouse
at Amsterdam The city however as a whole presents a combination of
magnitude and grandeur which we should in vain look for elsewhere
although with all its immensity it has not yet realized the quaint
prediction of James the Firstthat London would shortly be England
and England would be London
Morning
The metropolis presents certain features of peculiar interest just at
that unpopular dreamy hour when stars begin to pale their ineffectual
fires and the drowsy twilight of the doubtful day brightens apace
into the fulness of morning blushing like an Eastern bride Then it
is that the extremes of society first meet under circumstances
well calculated to indicate the moral width between their several
conditions The gilded chariot bowls along from square to square with
its delicate patrimonial possessor bearing him homeward in celerity
and silence worn with lassitude and heated with wine quaffed at his
third rout after having deserted the oftseen ballet or withdrawn in
pettish disgust at the utterance of a false harmony in the opera A
cabriolet hurries past him still more rapidly bearing a fashionable
physician on the fret at having been summoned prematurely from the
comforts of a second sleep in a voluptuous chamber on an experimental
visit to
Raise the weak head and stay the parting sigh
Or with new life relume the swimming eye
At the corners of streets of traffic and more especially
Where famd St Giless ancient limits spread
the matutinal huckster may be seen administering to costermongers
hackneycoachmen and fair women without discretion a fluid all
hot all hot ycleped by the initiated elder wine which we should
think might give the partakers a tolerable notion of the fermenting
beverage extracted by Tartars from mares milk not particularly fresh
Hard by we find a decent matron superintending her teatable at the
lamppost and tendering to a remarkably select company little blue
delft cups of bohea filled from time to time from a prodigious
kettle that simmers unceasingly on its charcoal tripod though the
refractory cad often protests that the fuel fails before the boiling
stage is consummated by an ebullition Hither approaches perhaps
an interesting youth from Magherastaphena who ere nightfall is
destined to figure in some policeoffice as a juvenile delinquent
The shivering sweep who has just travelled through half a dozen
stacks of chimneys also quickens every motion of his weary little
limbs when he comes within sight of the destined breakfast and
beholds the reversionary heel of a loaf and roll of butter awaiting
his arrival Another unfailing visiter is the marketgardener on
his way to deposit before the Covent Garden piazza such a pyramid
of cabbages as might well have been manured in the soil with Master
Jacks justly celebrated beanstalk Surely Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like one of these The female portion of
such assemblages for the most part consists of poor Salopian
strawberrycarriers many of whom have walked already at least
four miles with a troublesome burden and for a miserable
pittanceeggwomen with sundry stillborn chickens goslings and
turkeypoutsand passing milkmaidens peripatetic under the yoke of
their double pail Their professional cry is singular and sufficiently
unintelligible although perhaps not so much so as that of the Dublin
milkvenders in the days of Swift it used to run thus
Mugs jugs and porringers
Up in the garret and down in the cellar
They are in general a hale comely wellfavoured race
notwithstanding the assertion of the author of Trivia to the
contrary5
5 On doors the sallow milk maid chalks her gains
Oh how unlike the milkmaid of the plains
The most revolting spectacle to any one of sensibility which usually
presents itself about this hour is the painful progress of the jaded
foundered and terrified droves of cattle that one necessarily must
see not unfrequently struggling on to the appointed slaughterhouse
perhaps after three days during which they have been running
Their course of suffering in the public way
On such occasions we have often wished ourselves far from the sight of
city spire or sound of minster clock One feels most for the sheep
and lambs when the softened fancy recurs to the streams and hedgerows
and pleasant pastures from whence the woolly exiles have been ejected
and yet the emotion of pity isnot wholly unaccompanied by admiration at
the sagacity of the canine disciplinarians that bay them remorselessly
forward and sternly refuse the stragglers permission to make a
reconnoissance on the road They are highly respectable members of
society these same sheepdogs and we wish we could say as much for the
curs of low degree that just at the same hour begin to prowl up and
down St Giless and to and fro in it seeking what they may devour
with the fear of the Alderman of Cripplegate Within before their eyes
The feline kind however have reason to think themselves in more danger
at the first round of the watering cart for we have often rescued an
unsuspicious tortoiseshell from the felonious designs of a skindealer
who was about to lay violent hands on unoffending puss while she was
watching the process of making bread through the crevices of a Scotch
grating6
6 They say that no town in Europe is without a Scotchman for an
inhabitant This trade in London is generally professed by North
Britons and it is always a cause of alarm to a stranger if he
notices the enormous column of black smoke which is emitted from
their premises at the dawn of the morning
Another animal sui generis occasionally visible about the same
cockcrowing season is the parliamentary reporter shuffling to
roost and a more slovenlylooking operative from sunrise to sunset
is rarely to be seen There has probably been a double debate and
between three and five oclock he has written a column bould
No one can well mistake him The features are often Irish the
gait jaunty or resolutely brisk but neither buxom blithe nor
debonnair complexion wan expression pensive and the entire
propriety of the toilette disarranged and degagee The stuff that
he has perpetrated is happily no longer present to his memory and
neither placemans sophistry nor patriots rant will be likely in
any way to interfere with his repose Intense fatigue whether
intellectual or manual however is not the best security for sound
slumber at any hour more particularly in the morning
Even at this hour the swart Savoyard filius nullius issues forth
on his diurnal pilgrimage remote unfriended melancholy slow to
excruciate on his superannuated hurdygurdy that sublime melody the
hundred and seventh psalm or the plaintive sweetness of Isabel
perhaps speculating on a breakfast for himself and Pug somewhere
between Knightsbridge and Old Brentford Poor fellow Could he
procure a few bones of mutton how hard would it be for his hungry
comprehension to understand the displeasure which similar objects
occasioned to Attila on the plains of Champagne
Then the too frequent preparations for a Newgate executionbut enough
of such details it is the muse of Mr Crabbe that alone could do them
justice We would say to the great city in the benedictory spirit of
the patriot of Veniceesto perpetua Notwithstanding thy manifold
honest knaveries peace be within thy walls and plenty pervade thy
palaces that thou mayest ever approve thyself oh queen of capitals
Like Samsons riddle in the sacred song
