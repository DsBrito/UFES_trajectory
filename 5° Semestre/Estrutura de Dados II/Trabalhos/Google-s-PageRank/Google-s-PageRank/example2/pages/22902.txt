set the pewter down Dick saw him scratch something on it and beckon
almost imperceptably to a man near by who had just entered Then as if
by accident knocked his pewter off the table to the floor The other
man came forward picked it up and set it on the table but Dick could
see that he glanced at it at the same time and then as if upon a place
to sit came toward them and sat three or four tables away The
suspected spy presently arose and went out and Dick said
Well goodby Bob I will meet you at Trinity church in half an hour
Then muttering the words Bowling Green ten minutes he walked away
going past the table where the man with the steeplecrowned hat had been
sitting and carelessly knocking off the pewter Picking it up he looked
at it and saw scratched on one side Follow Slater
So this is another as I supposed he thought There are several
spies in town and they know me and are trying either to learn something
or to get possession of me We shall have to turn the tables on them
He made his way to the Bowling Green meeting on the way four or five of
the Liberty Boys
Go up to Trinity church boys he said stroll about the place
carelessly There is British spy watching my movements and I wish to
watch him and if possible to catch him The man is short and rather
stout and had a red face There is another who may not join him at
once who wears a black suit and a steeplecrowned hat and has a beard
He will send the other one first I think
All right Captain replied the boy whose name was Ben Spurlock We
will watch him Come along Sam
Dick had gone on meanwhile the boys proceeding in couples or singly to
the church where they scattered about waiting further instructions from
the young captain Bob appeared at the Bowling Green at the appointed
time and said
The fellow was cautious and did not follow me but I suppose he will be
at the church
Probably as his instructions were to follow me Did he stay as long as
you did
Yes and remained after I left You will see him at the church no
doubt The other man may be there Come into the nearest tavern and
exchange coats with me We will see if these men are observant or not
Very good laughed Bob
In the private bar of the tavern the boys were alone long enough to make
the exchange and then Dick sent Bob ahead and told him to wait in the
churchyard for him or some one wearing his own uniform
You are the captain now Bob with a laugh but I dont know who will
be the lieutenant yet That will depend
Dick then went over to Stone street where he entered a little shop kept
by a draper to whom he said
I want an ordinary suit of clothes Mr Towns I am watching a spy and
I think it just as well not to be in uniform
I see Captain You are wearing the lieutenants coat now
You are very observant smiling I will leave it here and send one of
the boys for it
Very good Captain Step into the wareroom and take what you wish
The wareroom was no bigger than the shop but the different suits were
hanging about the sides and Dick quickly selected one not likely to
attract much attention and put it on leaving the uniform behind On
Whitehall street Dick met one of the boys Phil Waters by name and
directed him to go to the drapers and put on Bobs coat over his own
the young lieutenant being of a heavier build As Phil did not have his
musket with him the change was easily effected and no one not knowing
him would suspect that he was not the lieutenant
Go and meet Bob Dick said and talk about anything but matters of
importance Do not recognize me and watch the man whom you see observing
you and Bob
All right Captain and Phil went away to make the change
Then Dick took his way up to the church and waited for the spy to
appear Coming out of the church after a stay of a few minutes Dick
saw Bob in the yard standing contemplating a monument while not far
away stood the second spy watching him At the time mentioned Phil who
was supposed to be Bob came up and the two began to chat in the most
animated fashion Dick saw the spy approach them so as to overhear their
conversation and at once signaled to Ben Sam Harry Will and others
whom he saw in the grounds to approach rapidly
Bob and Phil were talking away in the liveliest fashion about all sorts
of things except matters of importance the spy standing behind a
monument listening to them and trying to discover what connection the
talk had with the situation in the city Dick meanwhile had gathered the
various groups together and they were now closing in upon the spy
ready to act as soon as they got the word from the captain The man with
the steeplecrowned hat was not to be seen and Dick was uncertain
whether to wait for him or not Then the spy stepped up to Bob and Phil
and said glibly
Good day Captain You dont remember me I suppose I met you on Long
Island So you are over here now Where is your camp I should like to
send up an ox or two for your use Where did you say you were encamped
Dick passed at that moment but was not observed nor was a certain sign
he made to Bob Then the call of a bird was heard and Ben Sam and the
rest began to close in
On the Commons replied Bob Come up and see us some time You are
Mr Bulwinkle are you not
Yes I see you remember me very well
Then all at once he found himself surrounded by Liberty Boys and a
young man in plain garments stepped up and said
You are a British spy You and a man in a steeplecrowned hat in
Fraunces tavern tried to listen to my conversation I have not yet
caught your employer but if you make any alarm or try to get away you
will be denounced Go with these boys They will show you our camp
where you will remain a prisoner until I can deliver you up to General
Putnam
The mans face blanched and then he recognized Dick and muttered
Jove you are Slater the rebel himself How did you manage
Slater the patriot you mean Your superior is not very clever I
detected him following us Then he sat too close Next he scratched a
message on the pewter after beckoning to you You were told to follow
me You thought I was coming here in uniform didnt you After
practically telling you that I was going to be here I am afraid you are
new at spying too Go with the boys but talk and laugh and dont let
any one think that you are a prisoner
Jove but I never would have suspected you of all this clever work
muttered the other
I did not want you to laughed Dick and he and Bob went one way while
the boys went another with their prisoner
CHAPTER IIThe Spy in Danger
Dick Slater and Bob Estabrook set off down Broadway and had nearly
reached Bowling Green when Dick saw the man in the steeplecrowned hat
approaching He evidently took Dick for his friend at first for he came
forward quickly and then suddenly stopped looked at both boys
flushed and turning upon his heel darted across Broadway and into
Pearl street where he disappeared Dick was after him at once but by
the time he reached Pearl street nothing was to be seen of the spy
The boys walked down to Whitehall wharf where they could see over to
Staten Island where the British ships seemed to be getting ready to
change their positions The day was wearing on rapidly and as they
could not get any additional information at the wharf they turned their
faces toward the city and made their way at a good jog toward the
Commons where the camp was located As they neared Thames street above
the church Dick said in a low tone
There is that spy going down the street He has changed his disguise
and I would not be surprised if he had taken off his beard
Where is he Dick eagerly
Going down Thames street on the right the man in brown with a cocked
hat I recognize his walk Keep behind him Bob The sight of a
Continental uniform may have a bad effect upon him
But he has seen you in that disguise Dick
Yes and there is nothing striking about it He would have to see my
face to recognize me and I shall take care that he does not
Indeed Dick had so many ways of changing his expression that it was
quite likely he could deceive the spy even were they to meet face to
face Bob kept behind Dick as they went down the street on the same side
as the spy the young patriot watching the man closely and at length
seeing him go into a wine shop of a rather unsavory reputation When he
disappeared Dick turned to Bob and said quickly
There is another door to this place down the alley Go there at once
and watch for this fellow to come out He will do so as soon as he
recognizes me
Then Dick waited a moment for Bob to go down the alley and entered the
shop He saw the spy sitting at a table and now having his own
expression was recognized in a moment
Good afternoon he said as he walked over to the spy who was unable
to repress a start of surprise You did not expect to see me here did
you
Who are you the other snarled I dont know you from a side of sole
leather Why do you speak to me
I am Captain Dick Slater said Dick taking a seat opposite the spy
You escaped me just now and changed your dress and also took off your
beard You had a frienda short somewhat stout man We have taken care
of him You will find my lieutenant at the other door I see you are
looking toward it I think you had better go out that way Time presses
and we had better go now
The spy suddenly arose started for the door threw the chair in front
of Dick and shouted
This boy is a British spy Hold him while I go for the guard
Then he flew toward the door and was out of it At once the men in the
shop began surging toward Dick with evil looks on their faces and some
drawing uglylooking knives
That is the cry of Stop thief to draw attention from himself said
Dick My gentleman is a spy himself I am Dick Slater captain of the
Liberty Boys I think you may have heard of me Dont be afraid My
lieutenant is at the other door
Then quickly pushing the chair aside Dick left by the door he had
entered and then around to the alley The spy had evidently thought that
Dick was deceiving him but as he went into the alley he saw Bob who
quickly caught him by the arm and said
Wait a moment The captain will be out in a second and will want to see
you There is no such haste
Then Dick came down the alley and Bob said with a careless laugh and a
quizzical expression
Here is the captain I have his uniform but he is the captain just
the same
The spy got up glared at Dick and said angrily
You are making a great fuss over nothing I am not a spy as you think
I am an attorney and have
Why did you try to escape why did you call me a spy why did you
change your clothes why did you follow me into Frances tavern why did
you instruct your companion to follow me if you are not a spy
Attorneys dont do these things
The man turned sallow smiled in a sickly fashion and said
This was all to test you General Putnam had his doubts as to your
efficiency and wished me to put you to the
The boys laughed at this flimsy excuse and Dick said shortly
You will go with us I am well acquainted with General Putnam who is
in command in the city You know that of course We will go to his
quarters now
The man suddenly thrust his hand into his pocket and withdrew a packet
which he tried to throw over a fence but was prevented by Bob
You had better give that to me he said taking the packet and putting
it in his own pocket
Come said Dick It is nearly sunset If you attempt any more
nonsense I shall call the guard You know me and you know why you are
arrested and you are simply trying to throw obstacles in my way and so
make your escape
The spy made no reply and remained quiet for the rest of their way to
the generals quarters Leaving the prisoner under guard Dick shortly
saw the general himself and related what had occurred
Hm spies in the city eh muttered the veteran This is an
important capture Captain I must compliment you on a very pretty piece
of work I shall have to see this man
Dick had the packet which Bob had taken from the spy and he gave it to
the general while the man was being sent for Putnam looked it over and
said
This proves conclusively that the man is a spy You have the other one
you say Captain
Yes in our camp I can deliver him tonight or in the morning as you
please
I think it had better be tonight shortly
Very well and at that moment the spy was ushered into the generals
presence turning pale as he saw the veteran and realized what his fate
would be Dick then took his leave and he and Bob returned with all
speed to the camp
CHAPTER IIIIn the Stone House
Reaching the camp the boys were heartily welcomed by the Liberty Boys
who knew that something had happened when Ben and the rest came in with
a prisoner and were eager to hear the rest
Did you get the other fellow Captain asked Sam
Yes and we left him holding an interview with General Putnam
In which he was likely to get the worst of the argument put in Ben
dryly
At that moment a jollylooking Irish boy up and said giving a comical
salute
Captain dear supper do be ready an the young leddies have come to
camp an will ye ate thim foirstOi mane mate thim foirst an ate
supper afther or phwativer
There was a laugh and then two young very pretty young ladies rode up
to the fire and were helped to dismount by Dick and Bob The girls were
their sisters and their sweethearts also the sister of each being the
sweetheart of the other and were as constant companions as the boys
themselves They lived in Westchester county and had come to visit
friends in New York stopping on the way to see the boys
Well Alice said Dick to his sweetheart so you have come to the
city have you Things are in a rather turbulent state but I fancy we
can get you out of it in case there is any immediate trouble You will
stay to supper of course Patsy has just announced that it is ready so
we will lose no time in sitting down
The girls were well known to all the Liberty Boys and when they sat down
they received a general salute every boy there being glad to see them
After supper the boys who had brought in the spy took him to the
generals quarters and shortly after this Dick and Bob set out with the
girls to see them to the house of their friends in the city Dick and
Bob took their horses the captain riding a magnificent black Arabian
and Bob a fine bay and all set out together laughing and talking in
lively fashion They struck across the Common to the road running to the
west of it and would then make their way into the city past the new
church and Broadway to Maiden Lane
As they were going on at an easy jog expecting to leave the Common
four or five dark forms suddenly sprang up in front of them and seize
their bridles while as many ran up behind and prevented their wheeling
Then some one flashed the light of a lantern in their faces and a voice
was heard saying
Hm women We dont want them All want is the rebels
The girls horses were at once set free and the girls themselves lost
no time in wheeling and dashing back toward the camp Alice taking the
lead
Hi what are you doing growled one of men who were all evillooking
fellows as Dick could see The gals will bring the rest of the
rebels
Dick was dragged from the back of Major his black Arabian and one of
the men attempted to mount the animal to go in chase of the two girls
but was immediately thrown
Back to camp Major said Dick
In an instant the intelligent animal was flying after the girls who
quickly recognized his hoofbeats Meanwhile the men who had captured
Dick and Bob knew the danger they would run remaining on the ground and
they hurried away with the two boys letting Bobs bay go free They
went on so rapidly that Dick was unable to see much of the way but he
knew the direction they took almost by instinct and could have returned
without trouble if he had been liberated The men kept the two boys in
the middle of the party and held on to them tightly
We got the rebels an well get the reward said one
Yes the gals an the other rebels wont be able to find the house and
they can hunt all they like
It was a sharp decline to the river down the lane and one of the men
stumbled and rolled several yards picking himself up with a grunt and a
groan and a lot of bad language and then hurrying after the rest Dick
heard the swash of the water on the gravel bank and then saw the river
itself dimly but in another moment some dark object loomed up before
him and then he and Bob were taken into a house the front of which was
much lower than the back on account of the steepness of the hank The
boys were taken to the front and then down a flight of steps to a room
in the rear where they were left in the dark the door being locked and
barred on the outside
Who are these fellows do you suppose Dick asked Bob when they were
left alone
I dont know Tories no doubt or just men who want the reward offered
for my capture
But there is none offered for me with a laugh Why should they take
me with them
To keep you from giving the alarm They would have taken the girls if
they had thought twice
But will the girls be able to show them the way
They can take them to where we were attacked and after that the boys
will follow the trail Mark is a good hand at that sort of thing and he
will have good boys to help him
Yes they would all turn out and join in the hunt if he asked them
declared Bob
But there is no use in our staying in the dark Bob said Dick You
have matches with you
Yes They did not search us and I have matches and my pistols and
everything
Bob then lighted a sulphur match the only kind in use at the time and
looked about him They were in a room with one door but no windows and
were evidently under guard at the back of the stone house Dick listened
attentively for some minutes and at last heard the sound of some one
coming downstairs
Put out the light Bob he said in a low tone If they see it under
the door they may get suspicious
Bob blew out the candle and in a moment all was dark and still in the
room
When the door opens make a rush at it Bob and overturn the fellows
There are two of them
Bob stood ready to act upon the instant and the steps of the two men
coming on could be heard plainer than ever rays of light beginning to
show under the door The men said nothing and came on softly but
Dicks ears were very sharp and he could hear them with no trouble
The key was turned in the lock and the bolts shot back and then as the
door opened slowly the boys both threw their weight upon it suddenly
and sent it flying wide open in an instant There was a startled cry and
a heavy fall and in a moment the place was thrown into profound
darkness
Pick them up and lock them in Bob said Dick and the boys hurried
into the passage presently stumbling upon two men who were just getting
upon their feet
They seized the men threw them into the room closed the door and
locked them in taking out the key and then looked for the lantern as
they heard a call from above
CHAPTER IVThe Boys Escape
Hallo down there whats the matter called some one at the head of
the stairs
The blame rebels tried to get out and upset the lantern answered
Dick in a gruff voice
Huh where are they now
Theyre all right We locked the door again
Hm we better come down and help you We gotter take them away
All right come on an fetch another light
Then the boys began to move steadily toward the stairs finally finding
them
Come on Bob whispered Dick Dont waste any ceremony on them but
tumble them downstairs as soon as they come They wont get the others
out in a hurry for I have the key
The boys went rapidly upstairs but just as a light appeared at the
top the men in the room below began to shout
Hallo Bill Toby look out for them rebels theyve shut us up in the
storeroom
Hurry Bob hissed Dick
The two boys dashed up to the top of the steps and came upon two men
carrying lanterns In an instant each seized one of the Tories and sent
him rolling down the stairs uttering startled yells Then they hurried
forward in the dark to the front of the stone house opened the door and
ran out At the same moment they heard shouts from the house and then
shots were fired the bullets passing over their heads They returned
the shots and heard a yell and a sudden slamming of a door and then a
cry from up the bank
Hallo Dick Bob are you there
Yes Mark coming right along shouted Dick and then he and Bob
hurried up the steep bank presently seeing lanterns and a number of the
Liberty Boys
We had some little trouble in finding the place declared Mark when
Dick and Bob joined him and the rest there being fully a score of them
The young ladies had no idea where the wretches had gone but we picked
up the trail at length and then had less difficulty in following it
Where were you
In the stone housea regular nest of thieves Dick answered I must
have a look at the place later
There was no further sound from below and the boys went on to the top
where they found several of the Liberty Boys and the two girls
Dick and Bob now jumped into the saddle and resumed their interrupted
ride going with the girls to the house in Maiden Lane The friends of
Alice and Edith were very charming girls and the boys spent an hour or
two very pleasantly telling the story of their adventures in the
afternoon and evening and talking of the situation in in the city The
boys at length left the house to return to the camp Alice and Edith
expressing considerable anxiety however lest they be waylaid by the
men who had already made an unsuccessful attempt to keep them prisoners
In a short time they were back in camp the occasional tramp of a sentry
or the sudden flaring up of a fire from a puff of night air being the
only things to show that there was any one there The Liberty Boys were
always vigilant for one never knew when an enemy might be about and
Dick had taught them to be on the lookout at all times whether they
expected a foe or not After breakfast Dick took a party of about a
dozen of the boys in addition to Bob and set out for the stone house on
the river Reaching the lane the boys dismounted the descent being
rather too steep for the horses and Dick Bob and seven or eight others
went down The door toward the road was closed and there was no sign of
life about the place Dick and Bob went down to the shore where there
was a little wharf and here they found a door on the lower story this
being closed however as were the windows and no one stirring either
in or about the house
The place looks like an ordinary storehouse remarked Dick and I
suppose that the people about here think it is such I shall have to get
permission from the general to examine it for it is a nest of thieves
whatever else it may be
That is plain enough muttered Bob
Taking Bob and leaving the boys to watch the place Dick set out for
Putnams headquarters to report concerning the place and ask what should
be done Some of the boys remained on the bank above and some on the
wharf and near the lower door They found a passage under the wharf and
then another dug through the earth and leading to a door evidently in
the stone house under the bank and back of the wharf
These fellows are regular smugglers as well as thieves exclaimed
Harry This is an important discovery They use this place to take in
stolen goods when they are afraid to take them in any other I guess
See if the door is locked suggested Sam
Then he and Harry tried it and found that it was not fastened but
opened readily when they lifted the latch
Hallo Who is there cried a gruff voice as they advanced
Heres one of the rascals Catch him cried Harry
CHAPTER VAn Important Capture
Dick and Bob set out upon their horses for the generals quarters and
upon reaching Broadway met the girls coming along on horseback
I am afraid we cannot give you much attention now girls said Dick
We are going to the generals quarters and then to rout out the
thieves who make a rendezvous of the stone house and I think we shall
be very busy for sometime
You might go up to the camp and cheer Patsys heart by a visit
laughed Bob He is fond of the girls
You want us to get the poor boy in trouble I see said Alice You
would get so jealous that Patsy would have no peace
You know what Carl says when he disagrees with any one dont you
Sis asked Bob with a sly wink
Come my dear replied Alice I think we shall be able to do without
their company for a time We ought to be resourceful enough for that
But Alice brother and Bob have business to attend to and
And you are a dear little matter of face goose and cant see a joke
laughed Alice You would spoil both those boys but it needs me to put
them in the right place
Then the girls rode away toward the camp while the boys went on to the
generals The veteran listened to Dick and said
By all means break into the place and make a thorough investigation
Captain If there is any complaint say that I gave you full authority
to act There is something very about the whole affair and I do not
believe that the place is used for honest purposes
Nor we General but we wanted your authority before we proceeded to
vigorous measures
Well you have it now Captain said the general who was well
acquainted with Dick Bob and many of the Liberty Boys
They left the place jumped into the saddle were going up toward the
Commons when as they neared the head of Maiden Lane they suddenly
heard a sharp cry and saw a young girl in a chaise come dashing toward
them at a terrific pace the horse having taken fright at something and
being now beyond the girls control
Quick Bob cried Dick We must save her
Why its Sarah Watrous said Bob that being the name of the girls
friend whom the boys had seen the night before
The boys dashed forward one on each side the chaise Dick dismounting
and catching of the bridle throwing himself backward and checking the
animals speed Bob reached out at the same time and did what he could
to stop horse the two boys between them succeeding in checking him in a
short time
Oh I am so glad you came gasped the girl who seemed nearly ready to
swoon I dont know what I should have done without you He never ran
away before and I didnt know what do
What started him up Miss Watrous asked Dick stroking the horse and
getting him into calmer mood
I am sure I dont know I have been before and he never acted in this
fashion
Who harnessed him asked Bob looking the horse
Why I did The boy was busy and I couldnt wait so I did it myself
Why shouldnt I do things for myself instead of being always dependent
upon others
That is all right in theory laughed Bob but you have not done it
right and the horse has been chafed and annoyed and has finally tried
to get out of it and has run away You had better let me fix things
Well I declare exclaimed the girl And I thought I could do most
anything
Just then Dick caught sight of one of the men he had seen the night
before going down Broadway and he said to Bob in a low tone
Look after the young lady Bob There is one of those ruffians Take
Major up with you when you get through
Then he went away at not too rapid a walk and followed the man he had
seen observing him go into a tavern on the other side of the street and
just below the corner
Not a very reputable place he said to himself but I think I am safe
enough
Entering the place he saw the man he had followed sitting in a corner
talking to a man who if he was not greatly mistaken was the chief of
the two spies he had captured the day before and had turned over to
General Putnam The man recognized him and hastily arose and Dick knew
that he was not mistaken although how he should have escaped was a
puzzle to him
Stop that man He is a spy of the British he cried And the man with
him is a thief
Better not talk too loud in this place you saucy young rebel growled
the landlord coming forward All my customers are respectable persons
and if you dont like em your room is preferable to your company
From the black looks cast at him Dick saw that he was likely to get
into trouble the patrons of the place being evidently persons of shady
character and Tories He pushed forward nevertheless and suddenly
drawing a pistol said in a very determined manner
If you attempt to stop me you do it at your own risk One of those men
is an enemy to the country and the other an enemy to society and I
purpose to arrest them both
Run Hughson muttered the thief Ill fix the young rebel He threw
me downstairs last night and
Dick sprang upon the table leaped to the floor seized the thief by the
