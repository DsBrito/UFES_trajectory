INTRODUCTION
Elusive Truth
It was the Chicago Tribune of June 13th 189 which contained this
paragraph under the headline Big Broker Missing
The friends of Isidor Werner a young man prominent in Board of
Trade circles are much concerned about him as he has not been seen
for several days He made his last appearance in the wheat pit as a
heavy buyer Tuesday forenoon That afternoon he left his office at
Room 87 Board of Trade and has not been seen since nor can his
whereabouts be learned He is six feet two inches high of athletic
build with black hair and moustache a regular nose and an
unpronounced Jewish appearance His age is hardly more than
twentyseven but he has often made himself felt as a market force on
the Board of Trade where he was well thought of
But it was the Evening Post of the same date which prided itself on
unearthing the real sensation A scarehead across the top of a first
page column read
A PLUNGERS LAST PLUNGE
The daring young broker who held the whole wheat market in his hands
a few months ago amassing an independent fortune in three days but
losing most of it gamely on subsequent changes in the market has
made his last plunge This time he has gone into the cold kind bosom
of Lake Michigan Isidor Werner evened up his trades in the wheat
market last Tuesday forenoon and then applied for his balancesheet
at a higher clearing house No trace of him or clue to his
whereabouts was found until the Evening Post on the principle of
setting one mystery to solve another sent its representative to
examine a strange steel rocket discovered halfburied in the sands
of Lake Michigan near Berrien Springs two days ago Our reporter
investigated this bulletshaped contrivance and found an opening into
it and within he discovered a scrap of paper on which were written
the words Farewell to Earth for ever Werners friends when
interviewed by the Evening Post all positively identified the
handwriting of this scrap as his chirography It is supposed that he
took an excursion steamer to St Joseph Michigan last Tuesday or
Wednesday afternoon and walking down the shore toward Berrien
Springs finally threw himself into the Lake Neither Israel Werner
with whom the dead man lived on Indiana Avenue nor Patrick Flynn
the chief clerk at his office can give any reason for the suicide
or explain the exact connection of the infernal machine if such it
be with the sad circumstance But they both positively identify the
handwriting on the scrap of paper We have wired our representative
to bring the mysterious machine to Chicago and those who think they
may be able to throw any light upon the case are invited to call at
the office of the Evening Post and examine it
The Inter Ocean developed a theory that the suicide was only a
pretended one for the purpose of fraudulently collecting life insurance
policies It was cited that Isidor Werner had insured his life for more
than 100000 and this in spite of the fact that he had no family
parents brothers or sisters to provide for but had taken the policies
in favour of his uncle Israel Werner and in case of his prior death
in favour of a cousin Ruth Werner This theory gained but little
currency among those who knew the man best and although the insurance
companies prepared to resist payment of the policies to the bitter end
yet as time went on no one attempted to prove his death nor to claim
the handsome sum which would result from it Moreover Israel Werner and
his daughter Ruth the beneficiaries under the policies persisted in
believing that their relative was yet alive though they could give no
good reasons for so believing nor explain his disappearance
In its issue of June 15th the Tribune scouted the idea of suicide
altogether It had a better and more plausible theory of the case
Isidor Werner had a large sum of money in the Corn Exchange Bank
drawing interest by the year In case of either a premeditated or a
pretended suicide he would most certainly have withdrawn and made some
disposition of this money In fact he had on the day of his
disappearance drawn out five thousand dollars of it in gold For this
coin the Tribune believed he had been murdered and that they had a
clue to the murderer The vanished man had several times been seen in
the company of a suspicious German of intelligent but erratic
appearance This queer character lived in a hotbed of socialism on the
West Side and the young broker was supposed to be in his power In
fact it was known for certain that the erratic German had secured a
large sum of money from him and that Werner had visited his rooms in
the slums of the West Side more than once Moreover the two had made a
secret railway journey together two days before the disappearance and
on the very day that Werner was last seen the German had fled his
lodgings without giving any explanation of his departure to his few
acquaintances When the Tribune reporter called at these lodgings the
landlord still had in his possession a gold eagle with which the German
had paid his rent and in the grate of the deserted room were the
charred remains of burnt papers One of these was a rather firm crisp
cinder and had been a blueprint of a drawing As nearly as could be
judged from its shrivelled state it appeared to be the plan of some
infernal machine The name of the fugitive was Anderwelt and he called
himself a doctor Further investigations were being carried on by the
Tribune which promised to prove beyond a doubt that he was the
murderer of Isidor Werner
But the Evening Post still held the palm for sensations and I copy
verbatim from its columns of June 15th
It is rare that a newspaper dealing strictly in facts has to
record anything so closely bordering on the supernatural and
mysterious as that which we must now relate The following facts
however are vouched for by the entire editorial department of the
Evening Post and many of them by several hundred witnesses We
begin by apologising to the hundreds who have called at this office
and have been unable to see the Werner infernal machine We gave it
that name in a thoughtless jest but its subsequent actions have more
than justified the title Our reporter brought it from Berrien
Springs as directed and deposited it in the court of the Evening
Post building As is quite generally known this court is a central
well in the building affording ventilation and light to the interior
offices from every one of which can be seen what goes on in it The
well is spanned by a glass roof above the eighth storey In this
court at eleven oclock this morning the entire editorial and a
large part of the business staff of this paper repaired to examine
the mysterious rocketlike thing A little lid was opened showing
the recess where the telltale scrap of paper written by Werner had
been found Inside there seemed to be a pair of peculiar battery
cells whose exact nature was hidden by the outer shell Outside
there were several thumbscrews which were turned both ways without
any apparent effect While making this examination the machine had
been set up on its lower end and when it was again laid down it
refused to lie on its side but persisted in standing erect of its
own accord This was the more wonderful because the lower end was
not flat so that it would afford a good base but was pointed More
than a hundred people saw it stand up on this sharp tip saw it lift
up light weights which were placed upon it to hold it on its side
and saw it quickly right itself when it was placed vertically but
wrong end down
Thinking this queer property had been contributed to it in some way
by loosening the thumbscrews they were next all set down as tightly
as possible to see if this tendency to erectness would be lost
Then to the astonishment of every one in the court and of several
hundred people who were by this time watching from the interior
windows this infernal machine without any explosion burning of
gases or any apparent force acting upon it slowly rose from the
ground and then travelling more swiftly shot through the roof of
glass and vanished from sight Nor has the most diligent search
enabled us to recover it Does it possess the secret of Isidor
Werners death
But the Chicago Herald had been working thoroughly and saying little
until its issue of June 16th when it claimed the credit of solving the
whole mystery Its long article lies before me as I write There had
been no suicide there had been no murder there had been no infernal
machine Doctor Anderwelt was a learned man and the warm personal
friend of Isidor Werner Both men had shared the same fate they might
yet be alive but they were certainly at the bottom of Lake Michigan
together They were imprisoned there in a sunken submarine boat which
was the invention of Doctor Anderwelt and was built with funds
furnished by the young broker The foundryman who had constructed the
big torpedoshaped contrivance had been interviewed He knew both men
and they were on the most friendly terms In a moment of confidence
Doctor Anderwelt had told him the machine was for submarine exploration
had explained the fourwinged rudder which would make it dive into the
water rise to the surface or direct it to right or to left Moreover
there were closed living compartments around which were chambers
containing a supply of air He himself had pumped them full of
compressed air and it was so arranged that foul air could be let out
when used and new air admitted When all had been finished the
foundryman had shipped the new invention via the Michigan Southern
Railway to the shore of the Lake near Whiting Indiana Next the
Herald had sought and found the conductor whose train had hauled it to
Whiting He remembered switching off the flatcar there and he was
surprised on his return trip next morning to see the heavy thing already
unloaded and gone
Undoubtedly the two men had made an experiment with the diving boat
under the surface of the water and its failure to operate as hoped had
resulted in its sinking to the bottom with the two men imprisoned in
it On no other hypothesis could its disappearance and that of the two
men be so plausibly accounted for But as they had stores of air and
probably of food there was a possibility that they were still alive
inside the thing in the bottom of the Lake Only three days had elapsed
since it had been launched and the Herald was willing to head a
subscription to drag the Lake and send divers to search for and rescue
the two unfortunate men
All this serves to illustrate the untiring energy of newspaper
investigation as well as the remarkable fertility of journalistic
imagination for none of these clever theories hit at the real truth or
explained the correct bearing of the astonishing facts which the
newspapers had so industriously unearthed
And if the mystery of the disappearance of Isidor Werner was uncommonly
deep and wonderful the explanation and final solution of it is not less
marvellous After a delay of more than six years it has just now come
into my hands whole and perfect It is in no less satisfactory form than
a complete manuscript written by the very hand of Isidor Werner I came
strangely into possession of it and it relates a story of interest and
wonder compared with which the mystery of his disappearance pales into
insignificance But the reader may judge for himself for here follows
the story exactly as he wrote it Upon his manuscript I have bestowed
hardly more than a proofreaders technical revision

Secrets of Space
CHAPTER I
Dr Hermann Anderwelt
I had been busy all day trying to swarm the bees and secure my honey
The previous day had been February 29th a date which doesnt often
happen and which I had especial reason to remember for it had been the
most successful of my business career I had made a long guess at the
shaky condition of the great house of Slater Bawker  Co who had been
heavy buyers of wheat I had talked the market down sold it down
hammered it down and true enough what nobody else seemed to expect
really happened The big firm failed the price of wheat went to smash
in a panic of my mixing and as a result I saw a profit of more than
two hundred thousand dollars in the deal But in order to secure this
snug sum I still had to buy back the wheat I had sold at higher prices
and this I didnt find so easy The crowd in the wheat pit had seen my
hand and were letting me play it alone against them all
After the session I hurried to my office to get my overcoat and hat
having an engagement to lunch at the Club
If you please Mr Werner there is a queer old gentleman in your
private office who wishes to see you said Flynn my chief clerk
Ask him to call again tomorrow I am in a great hurry today I said
slipping on one sleeve of my overcoat as I started out
But he has been waiting in there since eleven oclock and said he very
much wished to see you when you had plenty of time He would not allow
me to send on the floor for you during the session
Since eleven oclock Did he have his lunch and a novel sent up Well
I can hardly run away from a man who has waited three and a half hours
to see me and I entered my private office with my overcoat on
Seated in my deep leathern armchair was an elderly man with rather
long and bushy irongrey hair and an uneven grey beard His head
inclined forward he breathed heavily and was apparently fast asleep
You will pardon my awaking you but I never do business asleep I
ventured rather loudly
Slowly the steelblue eyes opened and without any start or
discomposure the old man answered
And Imy most successful enterprises are developed in my dreams
His features and his accent agreed in pronouncing him German He arose
calmly buttoned the lowest button of his worn frockcoat and instead
of extending his hand to me he poked it inside his coat letting it
hang heavily on the single button It was a lazy but characteristic
attitude It tended to make his coat pouch and his shoulders droop I
remembered having seen it somewhere before
Mr Werner I have a matter of the deepest and vastest importance to
unfold to you he began rather mysteriously for which I desire five
hours of your unemployed time
Five hours I interrupted You do not know me That much is hard to
find without running into the middle of the night or into the middle of
the daywhich is worse for a busy man I have just five minutes to
spare this afternoon which will be quite time enough to tell me who you
are and why you have sought me
You do not know me because you do not expect to see me on this
hemisphere he continued Nor did I expect to find you a potent force
in the commercial world only three years after a literary and
linguistic preparation for a scholarly career Why the madchens of
Heidelberg have hardly had time to forget your tall athletic figure or
ceased wondering if you were really a Hebrew
You seem to be altogether familiar with my history I put in with a
little heat Kindly enlighten me equally well as to your own
I gave you the pleasure of an additional year of residence at the
University of Heidelberg not long ago he answered
I do not know how that can be for to my uncle I owe my entire
education there
Perhaps an unappreciated trifle of it you owe to your instructors and
lecturers Do you forget that I refused to pass your examinations in
physics and kept you there a year longer
You are not Doctor Anderwelt then
Hermann Anderwelt PhD at your service sir he replied somewhat
proudly
But when and why did you leave your chair at Heidelberg
It is to answer this that I ask the five hours he said slowly
Oh come now doctor you used to tell me more in a twohour lecture
than I could remember in a week I answered taking off my overcoat
and touching an electric button at my desk My office boy entered
Teddy have I had lunch today This was my favourite question on a
busy day and Teddy always answered it seriously
No sir you have an engagement to lunch at the Standard Club he
replied
Telephone to Gus at the Club that I cant come up today Also send
over to the Grand Pacific for a good lunch for two Have some beer in
itreal Munchner and in steins I directed and then I reclined on
a long leather lounge and motioned to the doctor to have a chair He
declined however and walked slowly back and forth before me as he
talked keeping his right hand inside his coat and with the left he
occasionally ploughed up his heavy hair as if to ventilate his brain
A year ago I gave up theoretical physics for applied physics I
resigned my chair at Heidelberg and came to this progressive city I
brought with me a working model of the greatest invention of this
inventive age Yet it was then neither perfect in design nor complete in
detail But now I have hit on the plan that makes it practicable and
certain of success I need only a little money to build it and the
world will open its eyes
But you must pardon me if instead of opening mine I shut them I
interrupted seeing the point quickly and losing no time in dodging I
have no money to invest in patent rights but still you must stay to
lunch with me
Just here the doctor seemed to find it necessary to diverge from the
orderly course of his lecture as he had prepared it and interject a few
impromptu observations
Events are difficult to forecast but the capabilities of a youth are
harder to divine One educates his son in all the fine arts and he
turns out a founder of pig iron Ones nephew is apprenticed to a
watchmaker and in a few years behold he is a great barrister Your
uncle educated you thoroughly in the old Hebrew and Chaldee of the
rabbis and lo you are now the ursa major of the wheat market
Just now you are in the centre of the kaleidoscope of success Slater
Bawker  Co were there a month ago but now they are only bits of
broken glass in the bottom of the heap And you you are really a
twisted bit of coloured glass like the rest but you chance to be thrown
to the middle The mirrors of public opinion multiply your importance
half a dozen times and behold you are reflected into the whole picture
But the kaleidoscope turns and the pieces of glass are shifted Other
broken chips now at the bottom of the heap will soon be filling the
centre
Permit me to change my figure of speech You are sweeping back the
waves of the sea while the tide is falling and the widemouthed public
looks on and whispers about that your broom makes all the waves obey
and drives them back at will Just when you begin to believe it yourself
the tide may turn and neither brooms nor all the powers on earth can
then sweep it back
Isidor Werner you believe yourself rich but your wealth is like
molasses in a sieve If you do not dip in your finger and taste the
sweet occasionally you will have nothing to show for your pains in the
end I shall ask you for but a taste of the sweet now so that I may
preserve a little of it against that day which may come when the sieve
will be bright and clean and empty again
There was a knock at the door
Come in I shouted Nothing but this lunch can save me from your
eloquence You have already ruined me in three similes
The waiter arranged a bountiful and tempting luncheon on a writing
table I commenced on it at once but the doctor though repeatedly
urged persistently refused He took a long draught at a stein of
Munich beer and continued
My invention proposes to navigate the air and the ether beyond as well
as the interplanetary spaces he said impressively
Flying machine eh I sneered between bites of planked whitefish
Indeed no he growled as if he detested this name My invention is
not a machine but a projectile It is not selfpropelling because if it
depended upon its own propelling apparatus it could not in thousands of
years navigate the interplanetary spaces It is a gravity projectile
and will travel at a rate of speed almost incalculable It does not fly
but its manner of travelling is more nearly like falling
I gave the doctor a quick searching look to see if I could discover any
signs of incipient insanity I met a firm steady gaze an earnest
convincing look Somehow I felt there was something real and true and
wonderful about to come from the great scholar before me and that I
must hear it and hear it all that I must lend a serious and thoughtful
attention My eyes were rivetted upon the doctors for fully a minute in
silence
Go on I said at last I am all attention
CHAPTER II
The Gravity Projectile
Hermann Anderwelt had probably suffered many disappointments and waited
long for a hearing Now he seemed to feel that his opportunity had come
for he continued with growing enthusiasm
Hitherto all attempts at space travelling have been too timid or
puerile We have experimented at aerial navigation as if the brief span
of air were a step in the mighty distance which separates us from our
sister planets As well might steamboats have been invented to cross
narrow streams and never have ventured on the mighty ocean We have
tried to imitate the bird the kite and the balloon and our
experiments have failed and always must so long as we do not look
farther and think deeper Every Icarus who attempts to overcome the
force of gravity which conquers planets and propel himself through the
air by any sort of apparatus will always finish the trip with a wiser
but badly bruised head
Still it has been freely predicted I ventured that this century
will not close without the invention of a successful airtravelling
machine
And I alone have hit upon the right plan because I have not attempted
to struggle against gravity but have made use of it only for
propelling my projectile exclaimed the doctor triumphantly
But wait I interposed Gravity acts only in one direction and that
is exactly opposite to the one you propose to travel
That brings me to the very important discovery I made in physics two
years ago upon which the whole success of the projectile rests You
will remember that according to the textbooks very little is known
about gravity except the laws of its action What it is and how it can
be controlled or modified have never been known Electricity was as
much a mystery fifty years ago but we know all its attributes We can
make it store it control it and use it for almost every necessity of
life The era of electricity is in full bloom but the era of
gravitational force is just budding
Can it be that we have as much to learn from gravity as electricity has
taught us in the last halfcentury I exclaimed as my eyes began to
open
I believe it will teach us far more wonderful things because it will
take us to unknown worlds while electricity has been confined to Earth
Its realm is the wide universe It will show us what life there is on
the planets It will make us at home with the stars
What he continued in a sort of ecstasy Do you think all great
discoveries are over all wonderful inventions made As well might a
trembling child elated with the success of its first feeble steps
alone suppose it had exhausted all the possibilities of life We are
but spelling over the big letters on the title page of the primary book
of knowledge There be other pages and grander chapters further on
There be greater volumes and sweeter more expressive tongues which man
may learn some day
Has a reasoning Divinity created the heavens and peopled the myriad
stars with thinking capable beings who must be perpetually isolated
Or may they not know each other some time But shall we attempt to sail
the vast heavens with a paper kite or try to fly Gods distances with
the wings of fluttering birds Nay we must use Gods engine for such a
task Has He tied the planets to the sun and knitted the suns and their
systems into one great universe obedient to a single law with no
possibility that we may use that law for intercommunication With what
wings do the planets fly around the sun and the suns move through the
heavens With the wings of gravity The same force for minute satellite
or mighty sun It is Gods omnipotence applied to matter Let us fly
with that
But will you permit me to suggest that we are soaring before the
projectile is built I put in
Quite right Let us come back to Earth and return to facts My studies
in physics led me to believe that all natural forcesgravity
centrifugal force and even capillary attractionare like electricity
and magnetism both positive and negative in their action If they do
not normally alternate between a positive and negative current as
electricity does they can be made to do so Gravity and capillary
attraction as we know them always act positively that is they always
attract On the other hand centrifugal force always acts negatively
that is it always repels But each of these forces I believe can
temporarily be made to act opposite to its usual manner I know this to
be the case with gravity for I have caused its positive and negative
currents to alternate that is I have made it repel and then attract
and so on at will by changing the polarity of the body which it acts
upon
Now that I remember it I added our original ideas of magnetism were
that it simply attracted We knew the lodestone drew the steel but only
on better acquaintance did we learn of its alternating currents
attractive and repellant
I have positively demonstrated with my working model that I can reverse
the force of gravity acting upon the model and make it sail away into
space I will show you this whenever you like It is so arranged that
the polarizing action ceases in three minutes after which the positive
current controls and the model falls to the Earth again
But have you ever attempted a trip yet I inquired
Oh no The model was not built to carry me but it has demonstrated
all the important facts and I now need ten thousand dollars to build
one large enough to carry several persons and to equip it with
everything necessary to make a trip to one of the planets With a man
inside to control the currents it will be far more easily managed than
the experimental model has been
Suppose you had the projectile built and everything was ready for a
start I said what would be the method of working it
I should enter the forward compartment began the doctor
But would you make the trial trip yourself
I certainly would not trust the secret of operating the currents to any
one else he remarked with emphasis And will you accompany me in the
rear compartment
No indeed unless you will promise to return in time for the following
days market I replied
Then I shall engage some adventurous fellow as assistant First we
must set the rudder which is both horizontal and vertical so that the
projectile can be steered up down or to either side Having fixed it
so as to be directed a little upward I begin with the currents
Suppose the projectile weighs a ton I gradually neutralize the positive
current which we are acquainted with as gravity When it is exactly
neutralized the projectile weighs nothing and the pressure of the air
is enough to make it rise more rapidly than a balloon When I have
created a negative current the projectile acquires a buoyancy equal to
its previous weight That is it will now fall up as rapidly as it
would previously have fallen down It will not do to put on the full
negative current at once for we should acquire a velocity that would
simply burn us up by friction with the atmosphere However the air is
soon passed if in the ether beyond there is very little friction or
none at all we shall go at full speed which will be the constantly
increasing velocity of a falling body
Somewhere between the Earth and the nearest planet he continued
there is a place where the attraction of one is just equal to the
attraction of the other and if a body is stopped in that fatal spot it
will be anchored there for ever by the equally matched forces tugging
in opposite directions There is such a dead line between all the
planets and our principal danger lies in falling into one of these for
we should remain there a twinkling star throughout eternity We must
trust to our momentum to carry us past this point and into space where
the gravitational attraction of the other planet is paramount Then we
must promptly change our current from negative to positive so that the
other planet will attract us to her Otherwise she would repel us back
to the dead line
With a positive current we are now literally falling into the new
planet We need not land unless we wish for as soon as we enter a
resisting atmosphere we can steer a course lacking barely a quarter of
being directly away from the planet just as you can sail a boat three
quarters against the wind
But suppose you experiment at making a landing on this new planet I
suggested
Very well Of course as soon as we enter an atmosphere it behoves us
to travel slowly to avoid overheating We can still safely travel
several hundred miles an hour however We continue falling until rather
near the planet then turning the rudder gently down we can sail
around and around the planet until we choose our landing place Gently
reversing currents a mild negative one soon overcomes our momentum
Tempering our currents experimentally to the pressure of the air we
can if we desire float like a feather and be wafted with every breeze
Just a suspicion of a positive current brings us gently to the surface
and when we have cooled we unscrew the rear porthole and crawl out to
explore a new world
I had mentally made the trip and was not only intensely interested but
infinitely pleased I was lost for some time with my imagination on the
new sphere but presently my mind returned to the practical side of the
question and I inquired
Are you quite sure that ten thousand dollars will be sufficient to
build and fully equip the projectile
Yes quite certain he answered with decision It will be ample for
that and for the expenses of forming a corporation to own my patents and
exploit the invention It is easy to see the projectile will be cheap of
construction No machinery is necessary no strong building to withstand
enormous shocks or anything of that kind The principal expenditures
