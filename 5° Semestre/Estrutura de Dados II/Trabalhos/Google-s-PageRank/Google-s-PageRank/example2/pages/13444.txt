KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY
1 The old maxim that Knowledge is power is a true one but there
is still a greater truth KNOWLEDGE IS SAFETY Safety amid physical
ills that beset mankind and safety amid the moral pitfalls that
surround so many young people is the great crying demand of the age
2 CRITICISMThis work though plain and to some extent startling
is chaste practical and to the point and will be a boon and a
blessing to thousands who consult its pages The world is full of
ignorance and the ignorant will always criticise because they live
to suffer ills for they know no better New light is fast falling
upon the dark corners and the eyes of many are being opened
3 RESEARCHES OF SCIENCEThe researches of science in the past few
years have thrown light on many facts relating to the physiology
of man and woman and the diseases to which they are subject and
consequently many reformations have taken place in the treatment and
prevention of diseases peculiar to the sexes
4 LOCK AND KEYAny information bearing upon the diseases of mankind
should not be kept under lock and key The physician is frequently
called upon to speak in plain language to his patients upon some
private and startling disease contracted on account of ignorance The
better plan however is to so educate and enlighten old and young
upon the important subjects of health so that the necessity to call a
physician may occur less frequently
5 PROGRESSIONA large respectable though diminishing class in
every community maintain that nothing that relates exclusively to
either sex should become the subject of popular medical instruction
But such an opinion is radically wrong ignorance is no more the
mother of purity than it is of religion Enlightenment can never work
injustice to him who investigates
6 AN EXAMPLEThe men and women who study and practice medicine are
not the worse but the better for such knowledge so it would be to
the community in general if all would be properly instructed on the
laws of health which relate to the sexes
7 CRIME AND DEGRADATIONHad every person a sound understanding on
the relation of the sexes one of the most fertile sources of crime
and degradation would be removed Physicians know too well what sad
consequences are constantly occurring from a lack of proper knowledge
on these important subjects
8 A CONSISTENT CONSIDERATIONLet the reader of this work study its
pages carefully and be able to give safe counsel and advice to others
and remember that purity of purpose and purity of character are the
brightest jewels in the crown of immortality
Illustration BEGINNING RIGHT
THE BEGINNING OF LIFE
1 THE BEGINNINGThere is a charm in opening manhood which has
commended itself to the imagination in every age The undefined hopes
and promises of the futurethe dawning strength of intellectthe
vigorous flow of passionthe very exchange of home ties and protected
joys for free and manly pleasures give to this period an interest and
excitement unfelt perhaps at any other
2 THE GROWTH OF INDEPENDENCEHitherto life has been to boys as to
girls a dependent existencea sucker from the parent growtha home
discipline of authority and guidance and communicated impulse But
henceforth it is a transplanted growth of its owna new and free
power of activity in which the mainspring is no longer authority or
law from without but principle or opinion within The shoot which
has been nourished under the shelter of the parent stem and bent
according to its inclination is transferred to the open world where
of its own impulse and character it must take root and grow into
strength or sink into weakness and vice
3 HOME TIESThe thought of home must excite a pang even in the
first moments of freedom Its glad shelterits kindly guidanceits
very restraints how dear and tender must they seem in parting How
brightly must they shine in the retrospect as the youth turns from
them to the hardened and unfamiliar face of the world With what a
sweet sadlycheering pathos they must linger in the memory And then
what chance and hazard is there in his newlygotten freedom What
instincts of warning in its very novelty and dim inexperience What
possibilities of failure as well as of success in the unknown future
as it stretches before him
4 VICE OR VIRTUECertainly there is a grave importance as well as
a pleasant charm in the beginning of life There is awe as well as
excitement in it when rightly viewed The possibilities that lie in
it of noble or ignoble workof happy selfsacrifice or ruinous
selfindulgencethe capacities in the right use of which it may rise
to heights of beautiful virtue in the abuse of which it may sink to
the depths of debasing vicemake the crisis one of fear as well as of
hope of sadness as well as of joy
5 SUCCESS OR FAILUREIt is wistful as well as pleasing to think of
the young passing year by year into the world and engaging with its
duties its interests and temptations Of the throng that struggle
at the gates of entrance how many may reach their anticipated goal
Carry the mind forward a few years and some have climbed the hills
of difficulty and gained the eminence on which they wished to
standsome although they may not have done this have kept their
truth unhurt their integrity unspoiled but others have turned back
or have perished by the way or fallen in weakness of will no more to
rise again victims or their own sin
6 WARNINGAs we place ourselves with the young at the opening gates
of life and think of the end from the beginning it is a deep concern
more than anything else that fills us Words of earnest argument and
warning counsel rather than of congratulation rise to our lips
7 MISTAKES ARE OFTEN FATALBegin well and the habit of doing well
will become quite as easy as the habit of doing badly Well begun
is half ended says the proverb and a good beginning is half
the battle Many promising young men have irretrievably injured
themselves by a first false step at the commencement of life while
others of much less promising talents have succeeded simply by
beginning well and going onward The good practical beginning is
to a certain extent a pledge a promise and an assurance of the
ultimate prosperous issue There is many a poor creature now crawling
through life miserable himself and the cause of sorrow to others
who might have lifted up his head and prospered if instead of merely
satisfying himself with resolutions of welldoing he had actually
gone to work and made a good practical beginning
8 BEGIN AT THE RIGHT PLACEToo many are however impatient of
results They are not satisfied to begin where their fathers did
but where they left off They think to enjoy the fruits of industry
without working for them They cannot wait for the results of labor
and application but forestall them by too early indulgence
HEALTH A DUTY
Perhaps nothing will so much hasten the time when body and mind will
both be adequately cared for as a diffusion of the belief that the
preservation of health is a duty Few seem conscious that there is
such a thing as physical morality
Mens habitual words and acts imply that they are at liberty to treat
their bodies as they please Disorder entailed by disobedience to
natures dictates they regard as grievances not as the effects of
a conduct more or less flagitious Though the evil consequences
inflicted on their descendents and on future generations are often as
great as those caused by crime they do not think themselves in any
degree criminal
It is true that in the case of drunkenness the viciousness of a bodily
transgression is recognized but none appear to infer that if this
bodily transgression is vicious so too is every bodily transgression
The fact is all breaches of the law of health are physical sins
When this is generally seen then and perhaps not till then will the
physical training of the young receive all the attention it deserves
Purity of life and thought should be taught in the home It is the
only safeguard of the young Let parents wake up on this important
subject

VALUE OF REPUTATION
1 WHO SHALL ESTIMATE THE COSTWho shall estimate the cost of a
priceless reputationthat impress which gives this human dross its
currencywithout which we stand despised debased depreciated Who
shall repair it injured Who can redeem it lost Oh well and truly
does the great philosopher of poetry esteem the worlds wealth as
trash in the comparison Without it gold has no value birth no
distinction station no dignity beauty no charm age no reverence
without it every treasure impoverishes every grace deforms
every dignity degrades and all the arts the decorations and
accomplishments of life stand like the beaconblaze upon a rock
warning the world that its approach is dangerous that its contact is
death
2 THE WRETCH WITHOUT ITThe wretch without it is under eternal
quarantine no friend to greet no home to harbor him the voyage of
his life becomes a joyless peril and in the midst of all ambition
can achieve or avarice amass or rapacity plunder he tosses on the
surge a buoyant pestilence But let me not degrade into selfishness
of individual safety or individual exposure this individual principle
it testifies a higher a more ennobling origin
3 ITS DIVINITYOh Divine oh delightful legacy of a spotless
reputation Rich is the inheritance it leaves pious the example
it testifies pure precious and imperishable the hope which it
inspires can there be conceived a more atrocious injury than to filch
from its possessor this inestimable benefit to rob society of its
charm and solitude of its solace not only to outlaw life but
attain death converting the very grave the refuge of the sufferer
into the gate of infamy and of shame
4 LOST CHARACTERWe can conceive few crimes beyond it He who
plunders my property takes from me that which can be repaired by time
but what period can repair a ruined reputation He who maims my person
effects that which medicine may remedy but what herb has sovereignty
over the wounds of slander He who ridicules my poverty or reproaches
my profession upbraids me with that which industry may retrieve and
integrity may purify but what riches shall redeem the bankrupt fame
What power shall blanch the sullied show of character There can be
no injury more deadly There can be no crime more cruel It is without
remedy It is without antidote It is without evasion

INFLUENCE OF ASSOCIATES
If you always live with those who are lame you will learn to
limpFROM THE LATIN
If men wish to be held in esteem they must associate with those who
are estimableLA BRUYERE
1 BY WHAT MEN ARE KNOWNAn author is known by his writings a
mother by her daughter a fool by his words and all men by their
companions
2 FORMATION OF A GOOD CHARACTERIntercourse with persons of decided
virtue and excellence is of great importance in the formation of a
good character The force of example is powerful we are creatures of
imitation and by a necessary influence our tempers and habits
are very much formed on the model of those with whom we familiarly
associate Better be alone than in bad company Evil communications
corrupt good manners Ill qualities are catching as well as diseases
and the mind is at least as much if not a great deal more liable to
infection than the body Go with mean people and you think life is
mean
3 GOOD EXAMPLEHow natural is it for a child to look up to those
around him for an example of imitation and how readily does he copy
all that he sees done good or bad The importance of a good example
on which the young may exercise this powerful and active element of
their nature is a matter of the utmost moment
4 A TRUE MAXIMIt is a trite but true maxim that a man is known
by the company he keeps He naturally assimilates by the force
of imitation to the habits and manners of those by whom he is
surrounded We know persons who walk much with the lame who have
learned to walk with a hitch or limp like their lame friends Vice
stalks in the streets unabashed and children copy it
5 LIVE WITH THE CULPABLELive with the culpable and you will
be very likely to die with the criminal Bad company is like a nail
driven into a post which after the first or second blow may be drawn
out with little difficulty but being once driven in up to the head
the pinchers cannot take hold to draw it out which can only be done
by the destruction of the wood You may be ever so pure you cannot
associate with bad companions without falling into bad odor
6 SOCIETY OF THE VULGARDo you love the society of the vulgar Then
you are already debased in your sentiments Do you seek to be with
the profane In your heart you are like them Are jesters and buffoons
your choice friends He who loves to laugh at folly is himself a fool
Do you love and seek the society of the wise and good Is this your
habit Had you rather take the lowest seat among these than the
highest seat among others Then you have already learned to be good
You may not make very much progress but even a good beginning is not
to be despised
7 SINKS OF POLLUTIONStrive for mental excellence and strict
integrity and you never will be found in the sinks of pollution and
on the benches of retailers and gamblers Once habituate yourself to a
virtuous course once secure a love of good society and no punishment
would be greater than by accident to be obliged for half a day to
associate with the low and vulgar Try to frequent the company of your
betters
8 PROCURE NO FRIEND IN HASTENor if once secured in haste abandon
them Be slow in choosing an associate and slower to change him
slight no man for poverty nor esteem any one for his wealth Good
friends should not be easily forgotten nor used as suits of apparel
which when we have worn them threadbare we cast them off and call
for new When once you profess yourself a friend endeaver to be
always such He can never have any true friends that will be often
changing them
9 HAVE THE COURAGE TO CUT THE MOST AGREEABLE ACQUAINTANCEDo this
when you are convinced that he lacks principle a friend should bear
with a friends infirmities but not with his vices He that does a
base thing in zeal for his friend burns the golden thread that ties
their hearts together
SELFCONTROL
Honor and profit do not always lie in the same sackGEORGE
HERBERT
The government of ones self is the only true freedom for the
individualFREDERICK PERTHES
It is length of patience and endurance and forbearance that so much
of what is called good in mankind and womankind is shownARTHUR
HELPS
1 ESSENCE OF CHARACTERSelfcontrol is only courage under another
form It may also be regarded as the primary essence of character It
is in virtue of this quality that Shakespeare defines man as a being
looking before and after It forms the chief distinction between man
and the mere animal and indeed there can be no true manhood
without it
Illustration RESULT OF BAD COMPANY
2 ROOT OF ALL THE VIRTUESSelfcontrol is at the root of all the
virtues Let a man give the reins to his impulses and passions and
from that moment he yields up his moral freedom He is carried along
the current of life and becomes the slave of his strongest desire for
the time being
3 RESIST INSTINCTIVE IMPULSETo be morally freeto be more than an
animalman must be able to resist instinctive impulse and this can
only be done by exercise of selfcontrol Thus it is this power which
constitutes the real distinction between a physical and a moral life
and that forms the primary basis of individual character
4 A STRONG MAN RULETH HIS OWN SPIRITIn the Bible praise is given
not to a strong man who taketh a city but to the stronger man who
ruleth his own spirit This stronger man is he who by discipline
exercises a constant control over his thoughts his speech and his
acts Ninetenths of the vicious desires that degrade society and
which when indulged swell into the crimes that disgrace it
would shrink into insignificance before the advance of valiant
selfdiscipline selfrespect and selfcontrol By the watchful
exercise of these virtues purity of heart and mind become habitual
and the character is built up in chastity virtue and temperance
5 THE BEST SUPPORTThe best support of character will always be
found in habit which according as the will is directed rightly or
wrongly as the case may be will prove either a benignant ruler or
a cruel despot We may be its willing subject on the one hand or its
servile slave on the other It may help us on the road to good or it
may hurry us on the road to ruin
6 THE IDEAL MANIn the supremacy of selfcontrol says Herbert
Spencer consists one of the perfections of the ideal man Not to be
impulsive not to be spurred hither and thither by each desire that
in turn comes uppermost but to be selfrestrained selfbalanced
governed by the joint decision of the feelings in council assembled
before whom every action shall have been fully debated and calmly
determinedthat it is which education moral education at least
strives to produce
7 THE BEST REGULATED HOMEThe best regulated home is always that
in which the discipline is the most perfect and yet where it is the
least felt Moral discipline acts with the force of a law of nature
Those subject to it yield themselves to it unconsciously and though
it shapes and forms the whole character until the life becomes
crystallized in habit the influence thus exercised is for the most
part unseen and almost unfelt
8 PRACTICE SELFDENIALIf a man would get through life honorably
and peaceably he must necessarily learn to practice selfdenial
in small things as well as in great Men have to bear as well as to
forbear The temper has to be held in subjection to the judgment
and the little demons of illhumor petulance and sarcasm kept
resolutely at a distance If once they find an entrance to the mind
they are apt to return and to establish for themselves a permanent
occupation there
9 POWER OF WORDSIt is necessary to ones personal happiness to
exercise control over ones words as well as acts for there are
words that strike even harder than blows and men may speak daggers
though they use none The stinging repartee that rises to the lips
and which if uttered might cover an adversary with confusion how
difficult it is to resist saying it Heaven keep us says Miss
Bremer in her Home from the destroying power of words There are
words that sever hearts more than sharp swords do there are words the
point of which sting the heart through the course of a whole life
10 CHARACTER EXHIBITS ITSELFCharacter exhibits itself in
selfcontrol of speech as much as in anything else The wise and
forbearant man will restrain his desire to say a smart or severe thing
at the expense of anothers feeling while the fool blurts out what he
thinks and will sacrifice his friend rather than his joke The mouth
of a wise man said Solomon is in his heart the heart of a fool is
in his mouth
11 BURNSNo one knew the value of selfcontrol better than the poet
Burns and no one could teach it more eloquently to others but when
it came to practice Burns was as weak as the weakest He could not
deny himself the pleasure of uttering a harsh and clever sarcasm at
anothers expense One of his biographers observed of him that it
was no extravagant arithmetic to say that for every ten jokes he made
himself a hundred enemies But this was not all Poor Burns exercised
no control over his appetites but freely gave them the rein
Thus thoughtless follies laid him low
And stained his name
