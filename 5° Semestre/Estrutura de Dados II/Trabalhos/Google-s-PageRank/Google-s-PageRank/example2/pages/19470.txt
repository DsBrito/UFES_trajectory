Who Cares
Mi Darling Muse
Mi darlin Muse aw coax and pet her
To pleeas yo for aw like nowt better
An if aw find aw connot get her
To lend her aid
Into foorced measure then aw set her
The stupid jade
An if mi lines dooant run as spreetly
Nor beam wi gems o wit soa breetly
Place all the blameyoll place it reightly
Upon her back
To win her smile aw follow neetly
Along her track
Maybe shoo thinks to stop mi folly
An let me taste o melancholy
But just to spite her awl be jolly
An say mi say
Awl fire away another volley
Tho shoo says Nay
Weve had some happy times together
For monny years weve stretched our tether
An as aw dunnot care a feather
For fowk at grummel
Well have another try Aye whether
We stand or tummel
Sometimes th reward for all us trubble
Has been a crop o scrunty stubble
But th harvest someday may be double
At least well trust it
An them at say its but a bubble
Well leeav to brust it
To a Daisy Found blooming March 7th
Aa awm feeared thas come too sooin
Little daisy
Pray whativer wor ta doin
Are ta crazy
Winter winds are blowin yet
Thall be starved mi little pet
Did a gleam o sunshine warm thee
An deceive thee
Niver let appearance charm thee
For believe me
Smiles thall find are oft but snares
Laid to catch thee unawares
Still aw think it luks a shame
To tawk sich stuff
Awve lost faith an thall do th same
Hi sooin enuff
If thart happy as tha art
Trustin must be th wisest part
Come awll pile some bits o stooan
Raand thi dwellin
They may screen thee when awve gooanm
Thers no tellin
An when gentle spring draws near
Awll release thee niver fear
An if then thi pretty face
Greets me smilin
Aw may come an sit bith place
Time beguilin
Glad to think awd paar to be
Of some use if but to thee
Mi Bonny Yorksher Lass
Awve travelled East West North an South
An led a rooamin life
Awve met wi things ov stirlin worth
Awve shared wi joy an strife
Awve kept a gooid stiff upper lip
Whativvers come to pass
But th captain of mi Fortuns ship
Has been mi Yorksher Lass
Stormtossed sails rent an reckonin lost
A toy for wind an wave
Mid blindin fog an snow an frost
Awve thowt noa power could save
But ivver in the darkest day
Wi muscles strong as brass
To some safe port shoos led the way
Mi honest Yorksher Lass
Shoos fairall Yorksher lasses are
Shoos bonny as the rest
Her brow neer shows a line o care
Shoo thinks what is is best
Shoos lovin true an full o pluck
An it seems as clear as glass
At th lad is sewer to meet gooid luck
At weds a Yorksher Lass
Thers oriental beauties an
Grand fowk ov ivvery grade
But when it comes to honest worth
Shoo puts em all ith shade
For wi her charms an virtues
Shoo stands at top oth class
Thers nooan soa rare as can compare
Wi a bonny Yorksher Lass
Then heres to th Yorksher lasses
Whearivver they may be
Ther worth thers nooan surpasses
An thers nooan as brave an free
If awd to live life oer ageean
Awd think misen an ass
If aw didnt tak for company
A bonny Yorksher lass
Give it em Hot
Give it em hot an be hanged to ther feelins
Souls may be lost wol yor choosin yor words
Out wi them doctrines at taich o fair dealins
Daan wi a vice tho it may be a lords
What does it matter if truth be unpleasant
Are we to lie a mans pride to exalt
Why should a prince be excused when a peasant
Is bullied an blamed for a mich smaller fault
O thers too mich o that sneakin and bendin
An honest man still should be fearless and bold
But at this day fowk seem to be feeared ov offendin
An theyll bow to a cauf if its nobbut o gold
Give me a crust tho its dry an a hard en
If aw know its my own aw can ait it wi glee
Awd rayther bith hauf work all th day for a farden
Nor haddle a fortun wi bendin mi knee
Let ivery man by his merit be tested
Net by his pocket or th clooas on his back
Let hypocrites all o ther clooaks be divested
An what theyre entitled to that let em tak
Give it em hot but remember when praichin
All yo at profess others failins to tell
At yoll do far moor gooid wi yor tawkin an taichin
If yo set an example an improve yorsel
A Tale for th Childer on Christmas Eve
Little childerlittle childer
Harken to an old mans ditty
Tho yo live ith country village
Tho yo live ith busy city
Awve a little tale to tell yo
One at neer grows stale wi tellin
Its abaat One who to save yo
Here amang men made His dwellin
Riches moor nor yo can fancy
Moor nor all this world has in it
He gave up becoss He loved yo
An Hes lovin yo this minnit
All His power pomp and glory
Which to think on must bewilder
All He leftan what for think yo
Just for love ov little childer
In a common lowly stable
He wor laid an th stars wor twinklin
As if angels een wor peepin
On His face at th dew wor sprinklin
An one star like a big lantern
Shepherds who ther flocks wor keepin
Saw an follerd till it rested
Just aboon whear He wor sleepin
Then strange music an sweet voices
Seemd to sing reight aght o Heaven
Unto us a child is born
Unto us a son is given
Then coom wise men thro strange nations
Young men an men old an hoary
An they all knelt daan befoor Him
An araand Him shone a glory
Then a King thowt he wod kill Him
Tho he reckoned net to mind Him
But they went to a strange country
Whear this bad King couldnt find Him
An He grew up strong and sturdy
An He sooin began His praichin
An big craads stood raand to listen
An they wondered at His taichin
Then some sed bad things abaat Him
Called Him names laft at an jeered Him
Sed He wor a base imposter
For they hated yet they feeard Him
Some believed in His glad tidins
Saw Him cure men ov ther blindness
Saw Him make oncedeead fowk livin
Saw Him full o love an kindness
Wicked men at last waylaid Him
Dragd Him off to jail and tried Him
Tho noa fault they could find in Him
Yet they cursed an crucified Him
Nubdy knows ha mich He suffered
But His work on earth wor ended
From the grave whear they had laid Him
Into Heaven He ascended
Love like His may well bewilder
Sinners weel may bow befoor Him
Nah He waits for th little childer
Up in Heaven whear saints adore Him
Think when sittin raand yor hearthstun
An the Kursmiss bells are ringing
Ha He lived an died at yo may
Join those angels in ther singin
Words ov Kindness
Tis strange at fowk will be sich fooils
To mak life net worth livin
Fermentin rows creatin mooils
Detractin an deceivin
To fratch an worry day an neet
Is sewerly wilful blindness
When weel we know thers nowt as sweet
As a few words spoke i kindness
Ther is noa heart withaat its grief
The gayest have some sadness
But oft a kind word brings relief
An sheds a ray ov gladness
We ought to think of others moor
Nor ov ther pains be mindless
We may bring joy to monny a door
Wi a few words spoke i kindness
A peevish spaik a bitin jest
At may be thowtless spokken
May be like keen edged dagger prest
Throo some heart nearly brokken
Then let love be awr rule o life
This worlds cares we shall find less
For nowt can put an end to strife
Like a few words spoke i kindness
A Brussen Bubble
Bet wor a stirrin strappin lass
Shoo lived near Woodus Moor
An varry keen shoo wor for brass
Tho little wor her stoor
Shood wed for loveand as luck let
It proved a lucky hit
A finer chap yove seldom met
Or one wi better wit
His name awm net inclined to tell
But hed been kursend John
An he wor rayther praad hissel
An anxious to get on
At neet theyd sit an tawk an plan
Some way to mend ther state
What one chaps done another can
Sed Bet lets get agate
This morn wol darnin socks for thee
This thowt coom i mi nop
An dot we will if thall agree
Lets start a little shop
Well sell all sooarts o useful things
At ivverybody needs
Like scaarinstooan an tape an pins
An buttons sooap an threeds
An spice for th childercastor oil
An traitle drink an pies
An kinlin wood an maybe coil
Fresh yeast an hooks an eyes
Corn plaisters Bristol brick an clay
Puttates rewbub an salt
An if that cant be made to pay
It willnt be my fault
Th ideas a gooid en John replied
We should ha done t befoor
Aw raillee think at if its tried
West neer luk back noa moor
But whears th stock commin throo mi lass
Thats moor nor aw can tell
Fowk willnt come an spend ther brass
Unless yove stuff to sell
Why wodnt th maister lend a hand
Tha knows hes fond o me
A five paand nooat wod do it grand
Awd ax if aw wor thee
An John did ax an strange to say
He gat it thear an then
An Bet wor neer i sich a way
Fairly besides hersen
Soa th haase wor turned into a shop
An praad they woran Bet
Sed to hersenIt luks tip top
Awst be a lady yet
An th naybors coom throo far an near
To buy a thing or two
What theyd paid tuppence forwhy here
Bet made three awpence do
When John coom home at neet his wife
