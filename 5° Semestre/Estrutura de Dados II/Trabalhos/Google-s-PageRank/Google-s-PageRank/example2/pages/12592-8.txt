Mother Carke has been away to the town of Willarden to sell knit
stockings and is returning to her rude dwelling by Dardale Moss To
her right as far away as the eye can reach the moor stretches The
narrow track she has followed here tops a gentle upland and at her
left a sort of jungle of dwarfoak and brushwood approaches its edge
The sun is sinking bloodred in the west His disk has touched the
broad black level of the moor and his parting beams glare athwart the
gaunt figure of the old beldame as she strides homeward stick in
hand and bring into relief the folds of her mantle which gleam like
the draperies of a bronze image in the light of a fire For a few
moments this light floods the airtree gorse rock and bracken
glare and then it is out and gray twilight over everything
All is still and sombre At this hour the simple traffic of the
thinlypeopled country is over and nothing can be more solitary
From this jungle nevertheless through which the mists of evening are
already creeping she sees a gigantic man approaching her
In that poor and primitive country robbery is a crime unknown She
therefore has no fears for her pound of tea and pint of gin and
sixteen shillings in silver which she is bringing home in her pocket
But there is something that would have frighted another woman about
this man
He is gaunt sombre bony dirty and dressed in a black suit which a
beggar would hardly care to pick out of the dust
This illlooking man nodded to her as he stepped on the road
I dont know you she said
He nodded again
I never sid ye neyawheere she exclaimed sternly
Fine evening Mother Carke he says and holds his snuffbox toward
her
She widened the distance between them by a step or so and said again
sternly and pale
I hev nowt to say to thee whoeer thou beest
You know Laura Silver Bell
Thats a byneyam the lasss neyam is Laura Lew she answered
looking straight before her
One names as good as another for one that was never christened
mother
How know ye that she asked grimly for it is a received opinion in
that part of the world that the fairies have power over those who have
never been baptised
The stranger turned on her a malignant smile
There is a young lord in love with her the stranger says and Im
that lord Have her at your house tomorrow night at eight oclock
and you must stick cross pins through the candle as you have done for
many a one before to bring her lover thither by ten and her
fortunes made And take this for your trouble
He extended his long finger and thumb toward her with a guinea
temptingly displayed
I have nowt to do wi thee I nivver sid thee afoore Git thee awa
I earned nea goold o thee and Ill tak nane Awa wi thee or Ill
find ane that will mak thee
The old woman had stopped and was quivering in every limb as she thus
spoke
He looked very angry Sulkily he turned away at her words and strode
slowly toward the wood from which he had come and as he approached
it he seemed to her to grow taller and taller and stalked into it as
high as a tree
I conceited there would come something ot she said to herself
Farmer Lew must git it done nesht Sunda The aad awpy
Old Farmer Lew was one of that sect who insist that baptism shall be
but once administered and not until the Christian candidate had
attained to adult years The girl had indeed for some time been of an
age not only according to this theory to be baptised but if need be
to be married
Her story was a sad little romance A lady some seventeen years before
had come down and paid Farmer Lew for two rooms in his house She told
him that her husband would follow her in a fortnight and that he was
in the mean time delayed by business in Liverpool
In ten days after her arrival her baby was born Mall Carke acting as
sage femme on the occasion and on the evening of that day the poor
young mother died No husband came no weddingring they said was on
her finger About fifty pounds was found in her desk which Farmer
Lew who was a kind old fellow and had lost his two children put in
bank for the little girl and resolved to keep her until a rightful
owner should step forward to claim her
They found halfadozen loveletters signed Francis and calling the
dead woman Laura
So Farmer Lew called the little girl Laura and her sobriquet of
Silver Bell was derived from a tiny silver bell once gilt which
was found among her poor mothers little treasures after her death
and which the child wore on a ribbon round her neck
Thus being very pretty and merry she grew up as a Northcountry
farmers daughter and the old man as she needed more looking after
grew older and less able to take care of her so she was in fact
very nearly her own mistress and did pretty much in all things as she
liked
Old Mall Carke by some caprice for which no one could account
cherished an affection for the girl who saw her often and paid her
many a small fee in exchange for the secret indications of the future
It was too late when Mother Carke reached her home to look for a visit
from Laura Silver Bell that day
About three oclock next afternoon Mother Carke was sitting knitting
with her glasses on outside her door on the stone bench when she saw
the pretty girl mount lightly to the top of the stile at her left
under the birch against the silver stem of which she leaned her
slender hand and called
Mall Mall Mother Carke are ye alane all by yersel
Ay Laura lass we can be clooas enoo if ye want a word wi me
says the old woman rising with a mysterious nod and beckoning her
stiffly with her long fingers
The girl was assuredly pretty enough for a lord to fall in love
with Only look at her A profusion of brown rippling hair parted low
in the middle of her forehead almost touched her eyebrows and made
the pretty oval of her face by the breadth of that rich line more
marked What a pretty little nose what scarlet lips and large dark
longfringed eyes
Her face is transparently tinged with those clear Murillo tints which
appear in deeper dyes on her wrists and the backs of her hands These
are the beautiful gipsytints with which the sun dyes young skins so
richly
The old woman eyes all this and her pretty figure so round and
slender and her shapely little feet cased in the thick shoes that
cant hide their comely proportions as she stands on the top of the
stile But it is with a dark and saturnine aspect
Come lass what stand ye for atoppa t wall whar folk may chance to
see thee I hev a thing to tell thee lass
She beckoned her again
An I hev a thing to tell thee Mall
Come hidder said the old woman peremptorily
But ye munna gie me the creepins make me tremble I winna look
again into the glass o water mind ye
The old woman smiled grimly and changed her tone
Now hunny git tha down and let ma see thy canny feyace and she
beckoned her again
Laura Silver Bell did get down and stepped lightly toward the door of
the old womans dwelling
Tak this said the girl unfolding a piece of bacon from her apron
and I hev a silver sixpence to gie thee when Im gaen away heyam
They entered the dark kitchen of the cottage and the old woman stood
by the door lest their conference should be lighted on by surprise
Afoore ye begin said Mother Carke I soften her patois I mun
tell ye theres ill folk watchin ye Whats auld Farmer Lew about he
doesna get t sir the clergyman to baptise thee If he lets Sunda
next pass Im afeared yell never be sprinkled nor signed wi cross
while theres a sky aboon us
Agoy exclaims the girl whos lookin after me
A big black fella as high as the kipples came out o the wood near
Deadmans Grike just after the sun gaed down yester een I knew weel
what he was for his feet neer touched the road while he made as if
he walked beside me And he wanted to gie me snuff first and I
wouldna hev that and then he offered me a gowden guinea but I was no
sic awpy and to bring you here tonight and cross the candle wi
pins to call your lover in And he said hes a great lord and in
luve wi thee
And you refused him
Well for thee I did lass says Mother Carke
Why its every word true cries the girl vehemently starting to
her feet for she had seated herself on the great oak chest
True lass Come say what ye mean demanded Mall Carke with a dark
and searching gaze
Last night I was coming heyam from the wake wi auld farmer Dykes
and his wife and his daughter Nell and when we came to the stile I
bid them goodnight and we parted
And ye came by the path alone in the nighttime did ye exclaimed
old Mall Carke sternly
I wasna afeared I dont know why the path heyam leads down by the
waas o auld Hawarth Castle
I knaa it weel and a dowly path it is yell keep indoors o nights
for a while or yell rue it What saw ye
No freetin mother nowt I was feared on
Ye heard a voice callin yer neyame
I heard nowt that was dow but the hullyhoo in the auld castle was
answered the pretty girl I heard nor sid nowt thats dow but mickle
thats conny and gladsome I heard singin and laughin a long way
off I consaited and I stopped a bit to listen Then I walked on a
step or two and there sure enough in the PieMag field under the
castle was not twenty steps away I sid a grand company silks and
satins and men wi velvet coats wi gowdlace striped over them and
ladies wi necklaces that would dazzle ye and fans as big as
griddles and powdered footmen like what the shirra hed behind his
coach only these was ten times as grand
It was full moon last night said the old woman
Sa bright twould blind ye to look at it said the girl
Never an ill sight but the deaul finds a light quoth the old woman
Theres a rinnin brook tharyou were at this side and they at that
did they try to mak ye cross over
Agoy didnt they Nowt but civility and kindness though But ye mun
let me tell it my own way They was talkin and laughin and eatin
and drinkin out o long glasses and goud cups seated on the grass
and music was playin and I keekin behind a bush at all the grand
doins and up they gits to dance and says a tall fella I didna see
afoore Ye mun step across and dance wi a young lord thats faan in
luv wi thee and thats mysel and sure enow I keeked at him under
my lashes and a conny lad he is to my teyaste though he be dressed
in black wi sword and sash velvet twice as fine as they sells in
the shop at Gouden Friars and keekin at me again fra the corners o
his een And the same fella telt me he was mad in luv wi me and his
fadder was there and his sister and they came all the way from
Catstean Castle to see me that night and thats t other side o
Gouden Friars
Come lass yer no mafflin tell me true What was he like Was his
feyace grimed wi sut a tall fella wi wide shouthers and lukt like
an illthing wi black clothes amaist in rags
His feyace was long but weelfaured and darker nor a gipsy and his
clothes were black and grand and made o velvet and he said he was
the young lord himsel and he lukt like it
That will be the same fella I sid at Deadmans Grike said Mall
Carke with an anxious frown
Hoot mudder how cud that be cried the lass with a toss of her
pretty head and a smile of scorn But the fortuneteller made no
answer and the girl went on with her story
When they began to dance continued Laura Silver Bell he urged me
again but I wudna step oer twas partly pride coz I wasna dressed
fine enough and partly contrairiness or something but gaa I wudna
not a fut No but I more nor half wished it a the time
Weel for thee thou dudstna cross the brook
Hoitytoity why not
Keep at heyame after nightfall and dont ye be walking by yersel by
daylight or any light lang lonesome ways till after yere baptised
said Mall Carke
Im like to be married first
Tak care that marriage wont hang i the bellropes said Mother
Carke
Leave me alane for that The young lord said he was maist daft wi
luv o me He wanted to gie me a conny ring wi a beautiful stone in
it But drat it I was sic an awpy I wudna tak it and he a young
lord
Lord indeed are ye daft or dreamin Those fine folk what were
they Ill tell ye Dobies and fairies and if ye dont du as yer bid
theyll tak ye and yell never git out o their hands again while

Od wite it replies the girl impatiently whos daft or dreamin
noo Id a bin dead wi fear if twas any such thing It cudna be
all was sa luvesome and bonny and shaply
Weel and what do ye want o me lass asked the old woman sharply
I want to knowheres t sixpencewhat I sud du said the young
lass Twud be a pity to lose such a marrow hey
Say yer prayers lass I cant help ye says the old woman darkly
If ye gaa wi the people yell never come back Ye munna talk wi
them nor eat wi them nor drink wi them nor tak a pinsworth by
way o gift fra themmark weel what I sayor yere lost
The girl looked down plainly much vexed
The old woman stared at her with a mysterious frown steadily for a
few seconds
Tell me lass and tell me true are ye in luve wi that lad
What for sud I said the girl with a careless toss of her head and
blushing up to her very temples
I see how it is said the old woman with a groan and repeated the
words sadly thinking and walked out of the door a step or two and
looked jealously round The lass is witched the lass is witched
Did ye see him since asked Mother Carke returning
The girl was still embarrassed and now she spoke in a lower tone and
seemed subdued
I thought I sid him as I came here walkin beside me among the
trees but I consait it was only the trees themsels that lukt like
rinnin one behind another as I walked on
I can tell thee nowt lass but what I telt ye afoore answered the
old woman peremptorily Get ye heyame and dont delay on the way
and say yer prayers as ye gaa and let none but good thoughts come
nigh ye and put nayer foot autside the doorsteyan again till ye gaa
to be christened and get that done a Sunda next
And with this charge given with grizzly earnestness she saw her over
the stile and stood upon it watching her retreat until the trees
quite hid her and her path from view
The sky grew cloudy and thunderous and the air darkened rapidly as
the girl a little frightened by Mall Carkes view of the case walked
homeward by the lonely path among the trees
A black cat which had walked close by herfor these creatures
sometimes take a ramble in search of their prey among the woods and
thicketscrept from under the hollow of an oak and was again with
her It seemed to her to grow bigger and bigger as the darkness
deepened and its green eyes glared as large as halfpennies in her
affrighted vision as the thunder came booming along the heights from
the Willardenroad
She tried to drive it away but it growled and hissed awfully and set
up its back as if it would spring at her and finally it skipped up
into a tree where they grew thickest at each side of her path and
accompanied her high over head hopping from bough to bough as if
meditating a pounce upon her shoulders Her fancy being full of
strange thoughts she was frightened and she fancied that it was
haunting her steps and destined to undergo some hideous
transformation the moment she ceased to guard her path with prayers
She was frightened for a while after she got home The dark looks of
Mother Carke were always before her eyes and a secret dread prevented
her passing the threshold of her home again that night
Next day it was different She had got rid of the awe with which
Mother Carke had inspired her She could not get the tall
darkfeatured lord in the black velvet dress out of her head He had
taken her fancy she was growing to love him She could think of
nothing else
Bessie Hennock a neighbours daughter came to see her that day and
proposed a walk toward the ruins of Hawarth Castle to gather
blaebirries So off the two girls went together
In the thicket along the slopes near the ivied walls of Hawarth
Castle the companions began to fill their baskets Hours passed The
sun was sinking near the west and Laura Silver Bell had not come
home
Over the hatch of the farmhouse door the maids leant ever and anon
with outstretched necks watching for a sign of the girls return and
wondering as the shadows lengthened what had become of her
At last just as the rosy sunset gilding began to overspread the
landscape Bessie Hennock weeping into her apron made her appearance
without her companion
Her account of their adventures was curious
I will relate the substance of it more connectedly than her agitation
would allow her to give it and without the disguise of the rude
Northumbrian dialect
The girl said that as they got along together among the brambles
that grow beside the brook that bounds the PieMag field she on a
sudden saw a very tall bigboned man with an illfavoured smirched
face and dressed in worn and rusty black standing at the other side
of a little stream She was frightened and while looking at this
dirty wicked starved figure Laura Silver Bell touched her gazing
at the same tall scarecrow but with a countenance full of confusion
and even rapture She was peeping through the bush behind which she
stood and with a sigh she said
Is na that a conny lad Agoy See his bonny velvet clothes his sword
and sash thats a lord I can tell ye and weel I know who he
follows who he luves and who hell wed
Bessie Hennock thought her companion daft
See how luvesome he luks whispered Laura
Bessie looked again and saw him gazing at her companion with a
malignant smile and at the same time he beckoned her to approach
Darrat ta gaa not near him hell wring thy neck gasped Bessie in
great fear as she saw Laura step forward with a look of beautiful
bashfulness and joy
She took the hand he stretched across the stream more for love of the
hand than any need of help and in a moment was across and by his
side and his long arm about her waist
Fares te weel Bessie Im gain my ways she called leaning her
head to his shoulder and tell gud Fadder Lew Im gain my ways to be
happy and may be at lang last Ill see him again
And with a farewell wave of her hand she went away with her dismal
partner and Laura Silver Bell was never more seen at home or among
the coppies and wickwoods the bonny fields and bosky hollows by
Dardale Moss
Bessie Hennock followed them for a time
She crossed the brook and though they seemed to move slowly enough
she was obliged to run to keep them in view and she all the time
cried to her continually Come back come back bonnie Laurie
until getting over a bank she was met by a whitefaced old man and
so frightened was she that she thought she fainted outright At all
events she did not come to herself until the birds were singing their
vespers in the amber light of sunset and the day was over
No trace of the direction of the girls flight was ever discovered
Weeks and months passed and more than a year
At the end of that time one of Mall Carkes goats died as she
suspected by the envious practices of a rival witch who lived at the
far end of Dardale Moss
All alone in her stone cabin the old woman had prepared her charm to
ascertain the author of her misfortune
The heart of the dead animal stuck all over with pins was burnt in
the fire the windows doors and every other aperture of the house
being first carefully stopped After the heart thus prepared with
suitable incantations is consumed in the fire the first person who
comes to the door or passes by it is the offending magician
Mother Carke completed these lonely rites at dead of night It was a
dark night with the glimmer of the stars only and a melancholy
nightwind was soughing through the scattered woods that spread
around
After a long and dead silence there came a heavy thump at the door
and a deep voice called her by name
She was startled for she expected no mans voice and peeping from
the window she saw in the dim light a coach and four horses with
goldlaced footmen and coachman in wig and cocked hat turned out as
if for a state occasion
She unbarred the door and a tall gentleman dressed in black waiting
at the threshold entreated her as the only sage femme within
reach to come in the coach and attend Lady Lairdale who was about to
give birth to a baby promising her handsome payment
Lady Lairdale She had never heard of her
How far away is it
Twelve miles on the old road to Golden Friars
Her avarice is roused and she steps into the coach The footman
clapsto the door the glass jingles with the sound of a laugh The
tall darkfaced gentleman in black is seated opposite they are
driving at a furious pace they have turned out of the road into a
narrower one dark with thicker and loftier forest than she was
accustomed to She grows anxious for she knows every road and bypath
in the country round and she has never seen this one
He encourages her The moon has risen above the edge of the horizon
and she sees a noble old castle Its summit of tower watchtower and
battlement glimmers faintly in the moonlight This is their
destination
She feels on a sudden all but overpowered by sleep but although she
nods she is quite conscious of the continued motion which has become
even rougher
She makes an effort and rouses herself What has become of the
coach the castle the servants Nothing but the strange forest
remains the same
She is jolting along on a rude hurdle seated on rushes and a tall
bigboned man in rags sits in front kicking with his heel the
illfavoured beast that pulls them along every bone of which sticks
out and holding the halter which serves for reins They stop at the
door of a miserable building of loose stone with a thatch so sunk and
rotten that the rooftree and couples protrude in crooked corners
like the bones of the wretched horse with enormous head and ears
that dragged them to the door
The long gaunt man gets down his sinister face grimed like his hands
It was the same grimy giant who had accosted her on the lonely road
near Deadmans Grike But she feels that she must go through with it
now and she follows him into the house
Two rushlights were burning in the large and miserable room and on a
coarse ragged bed lay a woman groaning piteously
Thats Lady Lairdale says the gaunt dark man who then began to
stride up and down the room rolling his head stamping furiously and
thumping one hand on the palm of the other and talking and laughing
in the corners where there was no one visible to hear or to answer
Old Mall Carke recognized in the faded halfstarved creature who lay
on the bed as dark now and grimy as the man and looking as if she
had never in her life washed hands or face the once blithe and pretty
Laura Lew
The hideous being who was her mate continued in the same odd
fluctuations of fury grief and merriment and whenever she uttered a
groan he parodied it with another as Mother Carke thought in
saturnine derision
At length he strode into another room and banged the door after him
In due time the poor womans pains were over and a daughter was born
Such an imp with long pointed ears flat nose and enormous restless
eyes and mouth It instantly began to yell and talk in some unknown
language at the noise of which the father looked into the room and
told the sage femme that she should not go unrewarded
The sick woman seized the moment of his absence to say in the ear of
Mall Carke
If ye had not been at ill work tonight he could not hev fetched ye
Tak no more now than your rightful fee or hell keep ye here
At this moment he returned with a bag of gold and silver coins which
he emptied on the table and told her to help herself
She took four shillings which was her primitive fee neither more nor
less and all his urgency could not prevail with her to take a
farthing more He looked so terrible at her refusal that she rushed
out of the house
He ran after her
Youll take your money with you he roared snatching up the bag
still half full and flung it after her
It lighted on her shoulder and partly from the blow partly from
terror she fell to the ground and when she came to herself it was
morning and she was lying across her own doorstone
It is said that she never more told fortune or practised spell And
though all that happened sixty years ago and more Laura Silver Bell
wise folk think is still living and will so continue till the day of
doom among the fairies
WICKED CAPTAIN WALSHAWE OF WAULING
CHAPTER I
Peg ONeill Pays the Captains Debts
A very odd thing happened to my uncle Mr Watson of Haddlestone and
to enable you to understand it I must begin at the beginning
In the year 1822 Mr James Walshawe more commonly known as Captain
Walshawe died at the age of eightyone years The Captain in his
early days and so long as health and strength permitted was a scamp
of the active intriguing sort and spent his days and nights in
sowing his wild oats of which he seemed to have an inexhaustible
stock The harvest of this tillage was plentifully interspersed with
thorns nettles and thistles which stung the husbandman
unpleasantly and did not enrich him
Captain Walshawe was very well known in the neighborhood of Wauling
and very generally avoided there A captain by courtesy for he had
never reached that rank in the army list He had quitted the service
in 1766 at the age of twentyfive immediately previous to which
period his debts had grown so troublesome that he was induced to
extricate himself by running away with and marrying an heiress
Though not so wealthy quite as he had imagined she proved a very
comfortable investment for what remained of his shattered affections
and he lived and enjoyed himself very much in his old way upon her
income getting into no end of scrapes and scandals and a good deal
of debt and money trouble
When he married his wife he was quartered in Ireland at Clonmel
where was a nunnery in which as pensioner resided Miss ONeill or
as she was called in the country Peg ONeillthe heiress of whom I
have spoken
Her situation was the only ingredient of romance in the affair for
the young lady was decidedly plain though goodhumoured looking with
that style of features which is termed potato and in figure she was
a little too plump and rather short But she was impressible and the
handsome young English Lieutenant was too much for her monastic
tendencies and she eloped
In England there are traditions of Irish fortunehunters and in
Ireland of English The fact is it was the vagrant class of each
country that chiefly visited the other in old times and a handsome
vagabond whether at home or abroad I suppose made the most of his
face which was also his fortune
At all events he carried off the fair one from the sanctuary and for
some sufficient reason I suppose they took up their abode at
Wauling in Lancashire
Here the gallant captain amused himself after his fashion sometimes
running up of course on business to London I believe few wives have
ever cried more in a given time than did that poor dumpy
potatofaced heiress who got over the nunnery garden wall and jumped
into the handsome Captains arms for love
He spent her income frightened her out of her wits with oaths and
threats and broke her heart
Latterly she shut herself up pretty nearly altogether in her room She
had an old rather grim Irish servantwoman in attendance upon her
This domestic was tall lean and religious and the Captain knew
instinctively she hated him and he hated her in return often
threatened to put her out of the house and sometimes even to kick her
out of the window And whenever a wet day confined him to the house
or the stable and he grew tired of smoking he would begin to swear
and curse at her for a diddled old mischiefmaker that could never
be easy and was always troubling the house with her cursed stories
and so forth
But years passed away and old Molly Doyle remained still in her
original position Perhaps he thought that there must be somebody
there and that he was not after all very likely to change for the
better
CHAPTER II
The Blessed Candle
He tolerated another intrusion too and thought himself a paragon of
patience and easy good nature for so doing A Roman Catholic
clergyman in a long black frock with a low standing collar and a
