an open sesame to the magic door Others go in but I beat against its
flinty portals with hands that bleed No I have no right to be happy
The ways of the world are open the banquet of life is spread the
wonderworkers plan their pageants of beauty and joy and yet there is
no praise in my heart I have seen I have tasted I have tried Ashes
and dust and bitterness are all my gain I will try no more It is the
shadow of the vampire wing
So I sit in the glow of the great peat fire tired and sad beyond
belief Thank God at least I am home Everything is so little changed
The fire lights the oakpanelled hall the crossed claymores gleam the
eyes in the mounted deerheads shine glassily rugs of fur cover the
polished floor all is comfort home and the haunting atmosphere of my
boyhood Sometimes I fancy it has been a dream the Great White Silence
the lure of the goldspell the delirium of the struggle a dream and I
will awake to hear Garry calling me to shoot over the moor to see dear
little Mother with her meek sensitive mouth and her cheeks as
delicately tinted as the leaves of a briar rose But no The hall is
silent Mother has gone to her long rest Garry sleeps under the snow
Silence everywhere I am alone alone
So I sit in the big oakcarved chair of my forefathers before the
great peat fire a peakfaced drooping figure of a man with hair
untimely grey My crutch lies on the floor by my side My old nurse
comes up quietly to look at the fire Her rosy wrinkled face smiles
cheerfully but I can see the anxiety in her blue eyes She is afraid
for me Maybe the doctor has told hersomething
No doubt my days are numbered so I am minded to tell of it all of the
Big Stampede of the Treasure Trail of the Goldborn City of those who
followed the goldlure into the Great White Land of the evil that
befell them of Garry and of Berna Perhaps it will comfort me to tell
of these things Tomorrow I will begin tonight leave me to my
memories
Berna I spoke of her last She rises before me now with her spiritpale
face and her great troubleful grey eyes a little tragic figure
ineffably pitiful Where are you now little one I have searched the
world for you I have scanned a million faces Day and night have I
sought always hoping always baffled for God help me dear I love
you Among that mad lusting horde you were so weak so helpless yet so
hungry for love
With the aid of my crutch I unlatch one of the long windows and step
out onto the terrace From the cavernous dark the snowflakes sting my
face Yet as I stand there once more I have a sense of another land of
imperious vastitudes of a silent empire unfathomably lonely
Ghosts They are all around me The darkness teems with them Garry my
brother among them Then they all fade and give way to one face
Berna I love you always Out of the night I cry to you Berna the cry
of a broken heart Is it your little pitiful ghost that comes down to
me Oh I am waiting waiting Here will I wait Berna till we meet
once more For meet we will beyond the mists beyond the dreaming at
last dear love at last

THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE
Can you recall dear comrade when we tramped Gods land together
And we sang the old old EarthSong for our youth was very sweet
When we drank and fought and lusted as we mocked at tie and tether
Along the road to Anywhere the wide world at our feet
Along the road to Anywhere when each day had its story
When time was yet our vassal and lifes jest was still unstale
When peace unfathomed filled our hearts as bathed in amber glory
Along the road to Anywhere we watched the sunsets pale
Alas the road to Anywhere is pitfalled with disaster
Theres hunger want and weariness yet O we loved it so
As on we tramped exultantly and no man was our master
And no man guessed what dreams were ours as swinging heel and toe
We tramped the road to Anywhere the magic road to Anywhere
The tragic road to Anywhere such dear dim years ago
Songs of a Sourdough
CHAPTER I
As far back as I can remember I have faithfully followed the banner of
Romance It has given colour to my life made me a dreamer of dreams a
player of parts As a boy roaming alone the wild heather hills I have
heard the glad shouts of the football players on the green yet never
ettled to join them Mine was the richer rarer joy Still can I see
myself in those days a little shymannered lad in kilts bareheaded to
the hill breezes with healthbright cheeks and a soul happed up in
dreams
And indeed I lived in an enchanted land a land of griffins and
kelpies of princesses and gleaming knights From each black tarn I
looked to see a scaly reptile rise from every fearsome cave a corby
emerge There were green spaces among the heather where the fairies
danced and every scaur and linn had its own familiar spirit I peopled
the good green wood with the wild creatures of my thought nymph and
faun naiad and dryad and would have been in nowise surprised to meet
in the leafy coolness the great god Pan himself
It was at night however that my dreams were most compelling I strove
against the tyranny of sleep Lying in my small bed I revelled in
delectable imaginings Night after night I fought battles devised
pageants partitioned empires I gloried in details My rugged
warlords were very real to me and my adventures sounded many periods
of history I was a solitary caveman with an axe of stone I was a Roman
soldier of fortune I was a Highland outlaw of the Rebellion Always I
fought for a lost cause and always my sympathies were with the rebel I
feasted with Robin Hood on the Kings venison I fared forth with Dick
Turpin on the gibbethaunted heath I followed Morgan the Buccaneer
into strange and exotic lands of trial and treasure It was a wonderful
gift of visioning that was mine in those days It was the birdlike
flight of the pure childmind to whom the unreal is yet the real
Then suddenly I arrived at a second phase of my mental growth in which
fancy usurped the place of imagination The modern equivalents of
Romance attracted me and with my increasing grasp of reality my gift
of vision faded As I had hitherto dreamed of knighterrants of
corsairs and of outlaws I now dreamed of cowboys of goldseekers of
beachcombers Fancy painted scenes in which I too should play a
rousing part I read avidly all I could find dealing with the Far West
and ever my wistful gaze roved over the grey sea The spirit of Romance
beaconed to me I too would adventure in the stranger lands and face
their perils and brave their dangers The joy of the thought exulted in
my veins and scarce could I bide the day when the roads of chance and
change would be open to my feet
It is strange that in all these years I confided in no one Garry who
was my brother and my dearest friend would have laughed at me in that
affectionate way of his You would never have taken us for brothers We
were so different in temperament and appearance that we were almost the
reverse of each other He was the handsomest boy I have ever seen
frank fairskinned and winning while I was dark dour and none too
well favoured He was the best runner and swimmer in the parish and the
idol of the village lads I cared nothing for games and would be found
somewhere among the heather hills always by my lone self and nearly
always with a story book in my pocket He was clever practical and
ambitious excelling in all his studies whereas except in those which
appealed to my imagination I was a dullard and a dreamer
Yet we loved each others as few brothers do Oh how I admired him He
was my ideal and too often the hero of my romances Garry would have
laughed at my heroworship he was so matteroffact effective and
practical Yet he understood me my Celtic ideality and that shy
reserve which is the armour of a sensitive soul Garry in his fine
clever way knew me and shielded me and cheered me He was so buoyant and
charming he heartened you like Spring sunshine and braced you like a
morning wind on the mountain top Yes not excepting Mother Garry knew
me better than any one has ever done and I loved him for it It seems
overfond to say this but he did not have a fault tenderness humour
enthusiasm sympathy and the beauty of a young godall that was
manfully endearing was expressed in this brother of mine
So we grew to manhood there in that West Highland country and surely
our lives were pure and simple and sweet I had never been further from
home than the little market town where we sold our sheep Mother managed
the estate till Garry was old enough when he took hold with a vigour
and grasp that delighted every one I think our little Mother stood
rather in awe of my keen capable energetic brother There was in her a
certain dreamy wistful idealism that made her beautiful in my eyes and
to look on she was as fair as any picture Specially do I remember the
delicate colouring of her face and her eyes blue like deep
cornflowers She was not overstrong and took much comfort from
religion Her lips which were fine and sensitive had a particularly
sweet expression and I wish to record of her that never once did I see
her cross always sweet gentle smiling
Thus our home was an ideal one Garry tall fair and winsome myself
dark dreamy reticent and between us linking all three in a perfect
bond of love and sympathy our gentle delicate Mother
CHAPTER II
So in serenity and sunshine the days of my youth went past I still
maintained my character as a drone and a dreamer I used my time
tramping the moorland with a gun whipping the foamy pools of the burn
for trout or reading voraciously in the library Mostly I read books of
travel and especially did I relish the literature of Vagabondia I had
come under the spell of Stevenson His name spelled Romance to me and
my fancy etched him in his lonely exile Forthright I determined I too
would seek these ultimate islands and from that moment I was a changed
being I nursed the thought with joyous enthusiasm I would be a
frontiersman a trailbreaker a treasureseeker The virgin prairies
called to me the susurrus of the giant pines echoed in my heart but
most of all I felt the spell of those gentle islands where care is a
stranger and all is sunshine song and the glowing bloom of eternal
summer
About this time Mother must have worried a good deal over my future
Garry was now the young Laird and I was but an idler a burden on the
estate At last I told her I wanted to go abroad and then it seemed as
if a great difficulty was solved We remembered of a cousin who was
sheepranching in the Saskatchewan valley and had done well It was
arranged that I should join him as a pupil then when I had learned
enough buy a place of my own It may be imagined that while I
apparently acquiesced in this arrangement I had already determined that
as soon as I reached the new land I would take my destiny into my own
hands
I will never forget the damp journey to Glasgow and the misty landscape
viewed through the streaming window pane of a railway carriage I was in
a wondrous state of elation When we reached the great smoky city I was
lost in amazement not unmixed with fear Never had I imagined such
crowds such houses such hurry The three of us Mother Garry and I
wandered and wondered for three days Folks gazed at us curiously
sometimes admiringly for our cheeks were bright with Highland health
and our eyes candid as the June skies Garry in particular tall fair
and handsome seemed to call forth glances of interest wherever he went
Then as the hour of my departure drew near a shadow fell on us
I will not dwell on our leavetaking If I broke down in unmanly grief
it must be remembered I had never before been from home I was but a
lad and these two were all in all to me Mother gave up trying to be
brave and mingled her tears with mine Garry alone contrived to make
some show of cheerfulness Alas all my elation had gone In its place
was a sense of guilt of desertion of unconquerable gloom I had an
inkling then of the tragedy of motherhood the tender love that would
hold yet cannot the worldcall and the ruthless estranging years all
the memories of clinging love given only to be taken away
Dont cry sweetheart Mother I said Ill be back again in three
years
Mind you do my boy mind you do
She looked at me woefully sad and I had a queer heartrending prevision
I would never see her more Garry was supporting her and she seemed to
have suddenly grown very frail He was pale and quiet but I could see
he was vastly moved
Athol said he if ever you need me just send for me Ill come no
matter how long or how hard the way
I can see them to this day standing there in the drenching rain Garry
fine and manly Mother small and drooping I can see her with her
delicate rose colour her eyes like wood violets drowned in tears her
tender sensitive lips quivering with emotion
Goodbye laddie goodbye
I forced myself away and stumbled on board When I looked back again
they were gone but through the grey shadows there seemed to come back
to me a cry of heartache and irremediable loss
Goodbye goodbye
CHAPTER III
It was on a day of early Autumn when I stood kneedeep in the heather of
Glengyle and looked wistfully over the grey sea Twas but a month
later when homeless and friendless I stood on the beach by the Cliff
House of San Francisco and gazed over the fretful waters of another
ocean Such is the romance of destiny
Consigned so to speak to my cousin the sheepraiser of the
Saskatchewan I found myself setting foot on the strange land with but
little heart for my new vocation My mind cramful of book notions
craved for the larger life I was valiantly mad for adventure to fare
forth haphazardly to come upon naked danger to feel the bludgeonings
of mischance to tramp to starve to sleep under the stars It was the
callow boyidea perpetuated in the man and it was to lead me a sorry
dance But I could not overbear it Strong in me was the spirit of the
gypsy The joy of youth and health was brawling in my veins A few
thistledown years said I would not matter And there was Stevenson and
his glamorous islands winning me on
So it came about I stood solitary on the beach by the seal rocks with a
thousand memories confusing in my head There was the long train ride
with its strange pictures the crude farms the glooming forests the
gleaming lakes that would drown my whole country the aching plains
the mountains that ripsawed the sky the fearmadeeternal of the
desert Lastly a sudden sunlit paradise California
I had lived through a week of wizardry such as I had never dreamed of
and here was I at the very throne of Western empire And what a place it
was and what a peoplewith the imperious mood of the West softened by
the spell of the Orient and mellowed by the glamour of Old Spain San
Francisco A score of tongues clamoured in her streets and in her
byways a score of races lurked austerely She suckled at her breast the
children of the old grey nations and gave them of her spirit that swift
purposeful spirit so proud of past achievement and so convinced of
glorious destiny
I marvelled at the rush of affairs and the zest of amusement Every one
seemed to be making money easily and spending it eagerly Every one was
happy sanguine strenuous At night Market Street was a dazzling alley
of light where stalwart men and handsome women jostled in and out of
the glittering restaurants Yet amid this eager passionate life I felt
a dreary sense of outsideness At times my heart fairly ached with
loneliness and I wandered the pathways of the park or sat forlornly in
Portsmouth Square as remote from it all as a gazer on his mountain top
beneath the stars
I became a dreamer of the water front for the notion of the South Seas
was ever in my head I loafed in the sunshine sitting on the pieredge
with eyes fixed on the lazy shipping These were carefree
irresponsible days and not I am now convinced entirely misspent I
came to know the worthies of the wharfside and plunged into an
underworld of fascinating repellency Crimpdom eyed and tempted me but
it was always with whales or seals and never with pearls or copra I
rubbed shoulders with eager necessity scrambled for free lunches in
frowsy barrooms and amid the scum and debris of the waterside found
much food for sober thought Yet at times I blamed myself for thus
misusing my days and memories of Glengyle and Mother and Garry loomed
up with reproachful vividness
I was too a seeker of curious experience and this was to prove my
undoing The nightside of the city was unveiled to me With the
assurance of innocence I wandered everywhere I penetrated the warrens
of underground Chinatown wondering why white women lived there and why
they hid at sight of me Alone I poked my way into the opium joints and
the gambling dens Vice amazingly unabashed flaunted itself in my
face I wondered what my grim Covenanting ancestors would have made of
it all I never thought to have seen the like and in my inexperience it
was like a shock to me
My nocturnal explorations came to a sudden end One foggy midnight
coming up Pacific Street with its glut of saloons I was clouted
shrewdly from behind and dropped most neatly in the gutter When I came
to very sick and dizzy in a side alley I found I had been robbed of my
pocketbook with nearly all my money therein Fortunately I had left my
watch in the hotel safe and by selling it was not entirely destitute
but the situation forced me from my citadel of pleasant dreams and
confronted me with the grimmer realities of life
I became a habitue of the tencent restaurant I was amazed to find how
excellent a meal I could have for ten cents Oh for the uncaptious
appetite of these haphazard days With some thirtyodd dollars standing
between me and starvation it was obvious I must become a hewer of wood
and a drawer of water and to this end I haunted the employment offices
They were bare sordid rooms crowded by men who chewed swapped
stories yawned and studied the blackboards where the days wants were
set forth Only driven to labour by dire necessity their lives I
found held three phaseslooking for work working spending the
proceeds They were the Great Unskilled face to face with the necessary
evil of toil
One morning on seeking my favourite labour bureau I found an unusual
flutter among the benchwarmers A big contractor wanted fifty men
immediately No experience was required and the wages were to be two
dollars a day With a number of others I pressed forward was
interviewed and accepted The same day we were marched in a body to the
railway depot and herded into a fourthclass car
Where we were going I knew not of what we were going to do I had no
inkling I only knew we were southbound and at long last I might fairly
consider myself to be the shuttlecock of fortune
CHAPTER IV
I left San Francisco blanketed in grey fog and besomed by a roaring
wind when I opened my eyes I was in a land of spacious sky and broad
clean sunshine Orange groves rushed to welcome us orchards of almond
and olive twinkled joyfully in the limpid air tall gaunt and ragged
the scaly eucalyptus fluttered at us a morning greeting while snowy
houses wallowing in greenery flashed a smile as we rumbled past It
seemed like a land of promise of song and sunshine and silent and
apart I sat to admire and to enjoy
Looks pretty swell dont it
I will call him the Prodigal He was about my own age thin but
sunbrowned and healthy His hair was darkly red and silky his teeth
white and even as young corn His eyes twinkled with a humorsome light
but his face was shrewd alert and aggressive
Yes I said soberly for I have always been backward with strangers
Pretty good line The banana belt Old Sol working overtime Blossom
and fruit cavorting on the same tree Eternal summer Land of the
manana the festive frijole the neverchilly chili Ever been here
before
No
Neither have I Glad I came even if its to do the hornyhanded son
of toil stunt Got the makings
No Im sorry I dont smoke
All right guess I got enough
He pulled forth a limp sack of powdery tobacco and spilled some grains
into a brown cigarette paper twisting it deftly and bending over the
ends Then he smoked with such enjoyment that I envied him
Where are we going have you any idea I asked
Search me he said inhaling deeply the guy in charge isnt exactly
a free information bureau When it comes to peddling the bull con hes
there but when you try to pry off a few slabs of cold hard fact its
his Sunday off
But I persisted have you no idea
Well one thing you can bank on theyll work the Judas out of us The
gentle grafter nestles in our midst This heres a cinch game and we are
the fall guys The contractors are a bum outfit Theyll squeeze us at
every turn There was two plunks to the employment man they got half
Twenty for railway fare they come in on that Stop at certain hotels a
rakeoff there Stage fare more graft Five dollars a week for board
costs them twofifty and they will be stomach robbers at that Then
theyll ring in twice as many men as they need and lay us off half the
time so that we just about even up on our board bill Oh Im onto
their curves all right
Then I said if you know so much why did you come with us
Well if I know so much you just bet I know some more Ill go one
better You watch my smoke
He talked on with a wonderful vivid manner and an outpouring knowledge
of life so that I was hugely interested Yet ever and anon an allusion
of taste would betray him and at no time did I fail to see that his
roughness was only a veneer As it turned out he was better educated by
far than I a Yale boy taking a postgraduate course in the University
of Hard Luck
My reserve once thawed I told him much of my simple life He listened
intently sympathetic
Say said he earnestly when I had finished Im roughandready in my
ways Life to mes a game sort of masquerade and Im the worst
masquerader in the bunch But I know how to handle myself and I can
jolly my way along pretty well Now youre green if youll excuse me
saying it and maybe I can help you some Likewise youre the only one
in all the gang of hoboes thats my kind Come on lets be partners
I felt greatly drawn to him and agreed gladly
Now said he I must go and jolly along the other boys Arent they a
fierce bunch Coloured gentlemen Slavonians Polaks Dagoes
Swedeswell Ill go prospecting and see what I can strike
He went among them with a jabber of strange terms a bright smile and
ready banter and I could see that he was to be a quick favourite I
envied him for his ease of manner a thing I could never compass
Presently he returned to me
Say partner got any money
There was something frank and compelling in his manner so that I
produced the few dollars I had left and spread them before him
Thats all my wealth I said smilingly
He divided it into two equal portions and returned one to me He took a
note of the other saying
All right Ill settle up with you later on
He went off with my money He seemed to take it for granted I would not
object and on my part I cared little being only too eager to show I
trusted him A few minutes later behold him seated at a cardtable with
three roughnecked hardbittenlooking men They were playing poker
and thinks I Heres goodbye to my money It minded me of wolves and
a lamb I felt sorry for my new friend and I was only glad he had so
little to lose
We were drawing in to Los Angeles when he rejoined me To my surprise he
emptied his pockets of wrinkled notes and winking silver to the tune of
twenty dollars and dividing it equally handed half to me
Here says he plant that in your dip
No I said just give me back what you borrowed thats all I want
Oh forget it You staked me and its well won These guinneys took me
for a jay Thought I was easy but Ive forgotten more than they ever
knew and I havent forgotten so much either
No you keep it please I dont want it
Oh come put your Scotch scruples in your pocket Take the money
No I said obstinately
Look here this partnership of ours is based on financial equality If
you dont like my gate you dont need to swing on it
All right said I tartly I dont want to
Then I turned on my heel
CHAPTER V
On either side of us were swift hills mottled with green and gold ahead
a curdle of snowcapped mountains above a sky of robinsegg blue The
morning was lyric and set our hearts piping as we climbed the canyon We
breathed deeply of the heady air exclaimed at sight of a big bee ranch
shouted as a mule team with jingling bells came swinging down the trail
With cries of delight we forded the little crystal stream wherever the
trail plunged kneedeep through it Higher and higher we climbed mile
after mile our packs on our shoulders our hearts very merry I was as
happy as a holiday schoolboy willing this should go on for ever
dreading to think of the grimvisaged toil that awaited us
About midday we reached the end Gangs of men were everywhere ripping
and tearing at the mountain side There was a roar of blasting and
rocks hurtled down on us Bunkhouses of raw lumber sweated in the sun
Everywhere was the feverish activity of a construction camp
We were assigned to a particular bunkhouse and there was a great rush
for places It was floorless doorless and in part roofless Above the
medley of voices I heard that of the Prodigal
Say fellows lets find the softest side of this board Strikes me the
Companys mighty considerate All kinds of ventilation Good chance to
study astronomy Wonder if I couldnt borrow a mattress somewhere Ha
Good eye Watch me fellows
We saw him make for a tent nearby where horses were stabled He
reconnoitred carefully then darted inside to come out in a twinkling
staggering under a bale of hay
Hows that for rustling I guess Im slowhey what Guess this is
poor
He was wadding his bunk with the hay while the others looked on rather
enviously Then as a bell rang he left off
Hash is ready boys last call to the diningcar Come on and see the
pigs get their heads in the trough
We hurried to the cookhouse where a tin plate a tin cup a tin spoon
and a castiron knife was laid for each of us at a table of unplaned
boards A great mess of hash was ready and excepting myself every one
ate voraciously I found something more to my taste a can of honey and
some soda crackers on which I supped gratefully
When I returned to the bunkhouse I found my bunk had been stuffed with
nice soft hay and my blankets spread on top I looked over to the
Prodigal He was reading a limp cigarette between his yellowstained
fingers I went up to him
Its very good of you to do this I said
Oh no Not at all Dont mention it he answered with much
politeness never raising his eyes from the book
Well I said Ive just got to thank you And look here lets make
it up Dont let the business of that wretched money come between us
Cant we be friends anyway
He sprang up and gripped my hand
Sure nothing I want more Im sorry Another time Ill make allowance
for that shortercatechism conscience of yours Now lets go over to
that big fire theyve made and chew the rag
So we sat by the crackling blaze of mesquite sagebrush and liveoak
limbs while over us twinkled the friendly stars and he told me many a
strange story of his roving life
You know the old mans all broke up at me playing the fool like this
Hes got a glue factory back in Massachusetts Guess he stacks up about
a million or so Wanted me to go into the glue factory begin at the
bottom stay with it Stick to glue my boy he says become the Glue
King and so on But not with little Willie Lifes too interesting a
proposition to be turned down like that Im not repentant I know the
fatted calfs waiting for me getting fatter every day One of these
days Ill go back and sample it
It was he I first heard talk of the Great White Land and it stirred me
strangely
Every ones crazy about it Theyre rushing now in thousands to get
there before the winter begins Next spring there will be the biggest
stampede the world has ever seen Say Scotty Ive the greatest notion
to try it Lets go you and I I had a partner once whod been up
there Its a big dark grim land but theres the gold shining
shining and its calling us to go Somehow it haunts me that soft
gleamy virgin gold there in the solitary rivers with not a soul to pick
it up I dont care one rip for the value of it I can make all I want
out of glue But the adventure the excitement its that that makes me
fit for the foolish house
He was silent a long time while my imagination conjured up terrible
