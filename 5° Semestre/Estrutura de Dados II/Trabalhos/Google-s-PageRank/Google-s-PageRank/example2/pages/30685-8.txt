DEMMIN a town of Germany kingdom of Prussia on the navigable river
Peene which in the immediate neighbourhood receives the Trebel and the
Tollense 72 m WNW of Stettin on the BerlinStralsund railway
Pop 1905 12541 It has manufactures of textiles besides breweries
distilleries and tanneries and an active trade in corn and timber
The town is of Slavonian origin and of considerable antiquity and was a
place of importance in the time of Charlemagne It was besieged by a
German army in 1148 and captured by Henry the Lion in 1164 In the
Thirty Years War Demmin was the object of frequent conflicts and even
after the peace of Westphalia was taken and retaken in the contest
between the electoral prince and the Swedes It passed to Prussia in
1720 and its fortifications were dismantled in 1759 In 1807 several
engagements took place in the vicinity between the French and Russians
DEMOCHARES c 355275 BC nephew of Demosthenes Athenian orator and
statesman was one of the few distinguished Athenians in the period of
decline He is first heard of in 322 when he spoke in vain against the
surrender of Demosthenes and the other antiMacedonian orators demanded
by Antipater During the next fifteen years he probably lived in exile
On the restoration of the democracy by Demetrius Poliorcetes in 307 he
occupied a prominent position but was banished in 303 for having
ridiculed the decree of Stratocles which contained a fulsome eulogy of
Demetrius He was recalled in 298 and during the next four years1
fortified and equipped the city with provisions and ammunition In 296
or 295 he was again banished for having concluded an alliance with the
Boeotians and did not return until 287 or 286 In 280 he induced the
Athenians to erect a public monument in honour of his uncle with a
suitable inscription After his death some five years later the son of
Demochares proposed and obtained a decree Plutarch Vitae decem
oratorum p 851 that a statue should be erected in his honour
containing a record of his public services which seem to have consisted
in a reduction of public expenses a more prudent management of the
state finances after his return in 287 and successful begging missions
to the rulers of Egypt and Macedonia Although a friend of the Stoic
Zeno Demochares regarded all other philosophers as the enemies of
freedom and in 306 supported the proposal of one Sophocles advocating
their expulsion from Attica According to Cicero Brutus 83
Demochares was the author of a history of his own times written in an
oratorical rather than a historical style As a speaker he was noted for
his freedom of language Parrhesiastes Seneca De ira iii 23 He
was violently attacked by Timaeus but found a strenuous defender in
Polybius xii 13

DEMOCRACY Gr Greek demokratia from Greek demos the people
ie the commons and Greek kratos rule in political science that
form of government in which the people rules itself either directly as
in the small citystates of Greece or through representatives
According to Aristotle democracy is the perverted form of the third
form of government which he called Greek politeia polity or
constitutional government the rule of the majority of the free and
equal citizens as opposed to monarchy and aristocracy the rule
respectively of an individual and of a minority consisting of the best
citizens see GOVERNMENT and ARISTOCRACY Aristotles restriction of
democracy to bad popular government ie mobrule or as it has
sometimes been called ochlocracy Greek ochlos mob was due to
the fact that the Athenian democracy had in his day degenerated far
below the ideals of the 5th century when it reached its zenith under
Pericles Since Aristotles day the word has resumed its natural
meaning but democracy in modern times is a very different thing from
what it was in its best days in Greece and Rome The Greek states were
what are known as citystates the characteristic of which was that
all the citizens could assemble together in the city at regular
intervals for legislative and other purposes This sovereign assembly of
the people was known at Athens as the Ecclesia qv at Sparta as the
Apella qv at Rome variously as the Comitia Centuriata or the
Concilium Plebis see COMITIA Of representative government in the
modern sense there is practically no trace in Athenian history though
certain of the magistrates see STRATEGUS had a quasirepresentative
character Direct democracy is impossible except in small states In the
second place the qualification for citizenship was rigorous thus
Pericles restricted citizenship to those who were the sons of an
Athenian father himself a citizen and an Athenian mother Greek ex
amphoin astoin This system excluded not only all the slaves who were
more numerous than the free population but also resident aliens
subject allies and those Athenians whose descent did not satisfy this
criterion Greek to genei me katharoi The Athenian democracy which
was typical in ancient Greece was a highly exclusive form of
government
With the growth of empire and nation states this narrow parochial type
of democracy became impossible The population became too large and the
distance too great for regular assemblies of qualified citizens The
rigid distinction of citizens and noncitizens was progressively more
difficult to maintain and new criteria of citizenship came into force
The first difficulty has been met by various forms of representative
government The second problem has been solved in various ways in
different countries moderate democracies have adopted a low property
qualification while extreme democracy is based on the extension of
citizenship to all adult persons with or without distinction of sex The
essence of modern representative government is that the people does not
govern itself but periodically elects those who shall govern on its
behalf see GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATION
DEMOCRATIC PARTY originally DEMOCRATICREPUBLICAN PARTY the oldest of
existing political parties in the United States Its origin lay in the
principles of local selfgovernment and repugnance to social and
political aristocracy established as cardinal tenets of American
colonial democracy which by the War of Independence which was
essentially a democratic movement became the basis of the political
institutions of the nation The evils of lax government both central
and state under the Confederation caused however a marked
antidemocratic reaction and this united with the temperamental
conservatism of the framers of the constitution of 1787 in the shaping
of that conservative instrument The influences and interests for and
against its adoption took form in the groupings of Federalists and
AntiFederalists and these after the creation of the new government
became respectively in underlying principles and to a large extent
in personnel the Federalist party qv and the DemocraticRepublican
party1 The latter organized by Thomas Jefferson in opposition to the
Federalists dominated by Alexander Hamilton was a real party by 1792
The great service of attaching to the constitution a democratic bill of
rights belongs to the AntiFederalists or DemocraticRepublican party
although this was then amorphous The DemocraticRepublican party gained
full control of the government save the judiciary in 1801 and
controlled it continuously thereafter until 1825 No political
platforms were then known but the writings of Jefferson who
dominated his party throughout this period take the place of such His
inaugural address of 1801 is a famous statement of democratic
principles which today are taken for granted only because through the
party organized by him to secure their success they became universally
accepted as the ideal of American institutions In all the colonies
says John Adams a court and a country party had always contended
Jeffersons followers believed sincerely that the Federalists were a new
court party and monarchist Hence they called themselves Republicans
as against monarchistsstanding also incidentally for states rights
against the centralization that monarchy or any approach to it
implied and Democrats as against aristocratsstanding for the
common rights of Englishmen the rights of man the levelling of
social ranks and the widening of political privileges In the early
years of its historyand during the period of the French Revolution and
afterwardsthe Republicans sympathized with the French as against the
British the Federalists with the British as against the French
Devotion to abstract principles of democracy and liberty and in
practical politics a strict construction of the constitution in order
to prevent an aggrandizement of national power at the expense of the
states which were nearer popular control or the citizens have been
permanent characteristics of the Democratic party as contrasted with its
principal opponents but neither these nor any other distinctions have
been continuously or consistently true throughout its long course2
After 1801 the commercial and manufacturing nationalistic3 elements of
the Federalist party being now dependent on Jefferson for protection
gradually went over to the Republicans especially after the War of
1812 moreover administration of government naturally developed in
Republican ranks a group of broadconstructionists These groups fused
and became an independent party4 They called themselves National
Republicans while the Jacksonian Republicans soon came to be known
simply as Democrats5 Immediately afterward followed the tremendous
victory of the Jacksonians in 1828a great advance in radical
democracy over the victory of 1800 In the interval the Federalist party
had disappeared and practically the entire country embracing
Jeffersonian democracy had passed through the school of the Republican
party It had established the power of the people in the sense of that
word in presentday American politics Bills of rights in every state
constitution protected the citizen some state judges were already
elective very soon the people came to nominate their presidential
candidates in national conventions and draft their party platforms
through their convention representatives6 After the National
Republican scission the Democratic party weakened thereby in its
nationalistic tendencies and deprived of the leadership of Jackson
fell quickly under the control of its Southern adherents and became
virtually sectional in its objects Its states rights doctrine was
turned to the defence of slavery In thus opposing antislavery
sentimentinconsistently alike as regarded the rights of man and
constitutional construction with its original and permanent
principlesit lost morale and power As a result of the contest over
Kansas it became fatally divided and in 1860 put forward two
presidential tickets one representing the doctrine of Jefferson Davis
that the constitution recognized slaveproperty and therefore the
national government must protect slavery in the territories the other
representing Douglass doctrine that the inhabitants of a territory
might virtually exclude slavery by unfriendly legislation The
combined popular votes for the two tickets exceeded that cast by the
new antislavery Republican party the second of the name for Lincoln
but the election was lost During the ensuing Civil War such members of
the party as did not become War Democrats antagonized the Lincoln
administration and in 1864 made the great blunder of pronouncing the
war a failure Owing to Republican errors in reconstruction and the
scandals of President Grants administration the party gradually
regained its strength and morale until having largely subordinated
Southern questions to economic issues it cast for Tilden for president
in 1876 a popular vote greater than that obtained by the Republican
candidate Hayes and gained control of the House of Representatives
The Electoral Commission however made Hayes president and the quiet
acceptance of this decision by the Democratic party did it considerable
credit
Since 1877 the Southern states have been almost solidly Democratic but
except on the negro question such unanimity among Southern whites has
been naturally factitious and by no means an unmixed good for the
party Apart from the Solid South the period after 1875 is
characterized by two other party difficulties The first was the attempt
from 1878 to 1896 to straddle the silver issue7 the second an
attempt after 1896 to harmonize general elements of conservatism and
radicalism within the party In 1896 the South and West gained control
of the organization and the national campaigns of 1896 and 1900 were
fought and lost mainly on the issue of free silver which however
was abandoned before 1904 After 1898 imperialism to which the
Democrats were hostile became another issue Finally after 1896 there
became very apparent in the party a tendency to attract the radical
elements of society in the general realignment of parties taking place
on industrialsocial issues the Democratic party apparently attracting
in this readjustment the radicals and the masses as in the time of
Jefferson and Jackson In this process in the years 18961900 it took
over many of the principles and absorbed in large part the members of
the radical thirdparty of the Populists only to be confronted
thereupon by the growing strength of Socialism challenging it to a
farther radical widening of its programme From 1860 to 1908 it elected
but a single president Grover Cleveland 18851889 and 189318978
All American parties accepted long ago in theory Jeffersonian
democracy but the Democratic party has been the political champion of
those elements of the American democracy which are most democratic It
stands nearest the people9 It may be noted that the Jeffersonian
Republicans did not attempt to democratize the constitution itself The
choice of a president was soon popularized however in effect and the
popular election of United States senators is today a definite
Democratic tenet10

FOOTNOTES
1 The prefix Democratic was not used by Jefferson it became
established however and official
2 Under the rubric of strict construction fall the greatest
struggles in the partys history those over the United States Bank
over tariffsfor protection or for revenue onlyover internal
improvements over issues of administrative economy in providing for
the general welfare c The course of the party has frequently
been inconsistent and its doctrines have shown absolutely
considered progressive latitudinarianism
3 Nationalistic is used here and below not in the sense of a
general nationalistic spirit such as that of Jackson but to
indicate the centralizing tendency of a broad construction of
constitutional powers in behalf of commerce and manufactures
4 Standing for protective tariffs internal improvements c
5 It should be borne in mind however that the Democratic party of
Jackson was not strictly identical with the DemocraticRepublican
party of Jeffersonand some writers date back the origin of the
present Democratic party only to 18281829
6 The Democratic national convention of 1832 was preceded by an
AntiMasonic convention of 1830 and by the NationalRepublican
convention of 1831 but the Democratic platform of 1840 was the first
of its kind
7 The attitude of the Republican party was no less inconsistent and
evasive
8 It controlled the House of Representatives from 1874 to 1894
except in 18801882 and 18881890 but except for a time in
Clevelands second term there were never simultaneously a Democratic
president and a Democratic majority in Congress
9 Professor A D Morse in International Monthly October 1900
He adds It has done more to Americanize the foreigner than all
other parties It is predominant in the great cities of the
country
10 In connexion with the prevalent popular tendency to regard the
president as a peoples tribune it may be noted that a strong
presidential veto is historically peculiarly a Democratic
contribution owing to the history of Jacksons compare Clevelands
administration
DEMOCRITUS probably the greatest of the Greek physical philosophers
was a native of Abdera in Thrace or as some sayprobably wronglyof
Miletus Diog Laert ix 34 Our knowledge of his life is based almost
entirely on tradition of an untrustworthy kind He seems to have been
born about 470 or 460 BC and was therefore an older contemporary of
Socrates He inherited a considerable property which enabled him to
travel widely in the East in search of information In Egypt he settled
for seven years during which he studied the mathematical and physical
systems of the ancient schools The extent to which he was influenced by
the Magi and the Eastern astrologists is a matter of pure conjecture He
returned from his travels impoverished one tradition says that he
received 500 talents from his fellowcitizens and that a public funeral
was decreed him Another tradition states that he was regarded as insane
by the Abderitans and that Hippocrates was summoned to cure him
Diodorus Siculus tells us that he died at the age of ninety others make
him as much as twenty years older His works according to Diogenes
Laertius numbered seventytwo and were characterized by a purity of
style which compares favourably with that of Plato The absurd epithet
the laughing philosopher applied to him by some unknown and very
superficial thinker may possibly have contributed in some measure to
the fact that his importance was for centuries overlooked It is
interesting however to notice that Bacon De Principiis assigns to
him his true place in the history of thought and points out that both
in his own day and later in the times of Roman learning he was spoken
of in terms of the highest praise In the variety of his knowledge and
in the importance of his influence on both Greek and modern speculation
he was the Aristotle of the 5th century while the sanity of his
metaphysical theory has led many to regard him as the equal if not the
superior of Plato
His views may be treated under the following heads
1 The Atoms and Cosmology adopted in part at least from the
doctrines of Leucippus though the relations between the two are
hopelessly obscure While agreeing with the Eleatics as to the eternal
sameness of Being nothing can arise out of nothing nothing can be
reduced to nothing Democritus followed the physicists in denying its
oneness and immobility Movement and plurality being necessary to
explain the phenomena of the universe and impossible without space
notBeing he asserted that the latter had an equal right with Being
to be considered existent Being is the Full Greek pleres plenum
notBeing is the Void Greek kenon vacuum the infinite space in
which moved the infinite number of atoms into which the single Being of
the Eleatics was broken up These atoms are eternal and invisible
absolutely small so small that their size cannot be diminished hence
the name Greek atomos indivisible absolutely full and
incompressible they are without pores and entirely fill the space they
occupy homogeneous differing only in figure as A from N arrangement
as AN from NA position as N is Z on its side magnitude and
consequently in weight although some authorities dispute this But
while the atoms thus differ in quantity their differences of quality
are only apparent due to the impressions caused on our senses by
different configurations and combinations of atoms A thing is only hot
or cold sweet or bitter hard or soft by convention Greek nomo
the only things that exist in reality Greek etee are the atoms and
the void Lockes distinction between primary and secondary qualities is
here anticipated Thus the atoms of water and iron are the same but
those of the former being smooth and round and therefore unable to
hook on to one another roll over and over like small globes whereas
the atoms of iron being rough jagged and uneven cling together and
form a solid body Since all phenomena are composed of the same eternal
atoms just as a tragedy and a comedy contain the same letters it may
be said that nothing comes into being or perishes in the absolute sense
of the words cf the modern indestructibility of matter and
conservation of energy although the compounds of the atoms are
liable to increase and decrease appearance and disappearancein other
words to birth and death As the atoms are eternal and uncaused so is
motion it has its origin in a preceding motion and so on ad
infinitum For the Love and Hate of Empedocles and the Nous
Intelligence of Anaxagoras Democritus substituted fixed and necessary
laws not chance that is a misrepresentation due chiefly to Cicero
Everything can be explained by a purely mechanical but not fortuitous
system in which there is no room for the idea of a providence or an
intelligent cause working with a view to an end The origin of the
universe was explained as follows An infinite number of atoms was
carried downwards through infinite space The larger and heavier
falling with greater velocity overtook and collided with the smaller
and lighter which were thereby forced upwards This caused various
lateral and contrary movements resulting in a whirling movement
Greek dine resembling the rotation of Anaxagoras whereby similar
atoms were brought together as in the winnowing of grain and united to
form larger bodies and worlds Atoms and void being infinite in number
and extent and motion having always existed there must always have
been an infinite number of worlds all consisting of similar atoms in
various stages of growth and decay
2 The SoulDemocritus devoted considerable attention to the
structure of the human body the noblest portion of which he considered
to be the soul which everywhere pervades it a psychic atom being
intercalated between two corporeal atoms Although in accordance with
his principles Democritus was bound to regard the soul as material
composed of round smooth specially mobile atoms identified with the
fireatoms floating in the air he admitted a distinction between it
and the body and is even said to have looked upon it as something
divine These allpervading soul atoms exercise different functions in
different organs the head is the seat of reason the heart of anger
the liver of desire Life is maintained by the inhalation of fresh atoms
to replace those lost by exhalation and when respiration and
consequently the supply of atoms ceases the result is death It
follows that the soul perishes with and in the same sense as the body
3 PerceptionSensations are the changes produced in the soul by
external impressions and are the result of contact since every action
of one body and all representations are corporeal phenomena upon
another is of the nature of a shock Certain emanations Greek
aporrhoai aporrhoiai or images Greek eidola consisting of
subtle atoms thrown off from the surface of an object penetrate the
body through the pores On the principle that like acts upon like the
particular senses are only affected by that which resembles them We see
by means of the eye alone and hear by means of the ear alone these
organs being best adapted to receive the images or sound currents The
organs are thus merely conduits or passages through which the atoms pour
into the soul The eye for example is damp and porous and the act of
seeing consists in the reflection of the image Greek deikelon
mirrored on the smooth moist surface of the pupil To the interposition
of air is due the fact that all visual images are to some extent
blurred At the same time Democritus distinguished between obscure
Greek skotie cognition resting on sensation alone and genuine
Greek gnesie which is the result of inquiry by reason and is
concerned with atoms and void the only real existences This knowledge
however he confessed was exceedingly difficult to attain
It is in Democritus first that we find a real attempt to explain colour
He regards black red white and green as primary White is
characteristically smooth ie casting no shadow even flat black is
uneven rough shadowy and so on The other colours result from various
mixtures of these four and are infinite in number Colour itself is not
objective it is found not in the ultimate plenum and vacuum but
only in derived objects according to their physical qualities and
relations
4 TheologyThe system of Democritus was altogether antitheistic
But although he rejected the notion of a deity taking part in the
creation or government of the universe he yielded to popular prejudice
so far as to admit the existence of a class of beings of the same form
as men grander composed of very subtle atoms less liable to
dissolution but still mortal dwelling in the upper regions of air
These beings also manifested themselves to man by means of images in
dreams communicated with him and sometimes gave him an insight into
the future Some of them were benevolent others malignant According to
Plutarch Democritus recognized one god under the form of a fiery
sphere the soul of the world but this idea is probably of later
origin The popular belief in gods was attributed by Democritus to the
desire to explain extraordinary phenomena thunder lightning
earthquakes by reference to superhuman agency
5 EthicsDemocrituss moral systemthe first collection of ethical
precepts which deserves the namestrongly resembles the negative side
of the system of Epicurus The summum bonum is the maximum of pleasure
with the minimum of pain But true pleasure is not sensual enjoyment it
has its principle in the soul It consists not in the possession of
wealth or flocks and herds but in good humour in the just disposition
and constant tranquillity of the soul Hence the necessity of avoiding
extremes too much and too little are alike evils True happiness
consists in taking advantage of what one has and being content with it

DEMOGEOT JACQUES CLAUDE 18081804 French man of letters was born in
Paris on the 5th of July 1808 He was professor of rhetoric at the lycee
Saint Louis and subsequently assistant professor at the Sorbonne He
wrote many detached papers on various literary subjects and two reports
on secondary education in England and Scotland in collaboration with H
Montucci His reputation rests on his excellent Histoire de la
litterature francaise depuis ses origines jusqua nos jours 1851
which has passed through many subsequent editions He was also the
author of a Tableau de la litterature francaise au XVIIe siecle
1859 and of a work 3 vols 18801883 on the influence of foreign
literatures on the development of French literature He died in Paris in
1894
DEMOGRAPHY from Gr Greek demos people and Greek graphein to
write the science which deals with the statistics of health and
disease of the physical intellectual physiological and economical
aspects of births marriages and mortality The first to employ the word
was Achille Guillard in his Elements de statistique humaine ou
demographie comparee 1855 but the meaning which he attached to it
was merely that of the science which treats of the condition general
movement and progress of population in civilized countries ie little
more than what is comprised in the ordinary vital statistics gleaned
from census and registration reports The word has come to have a much
wider meaning and may now be defined as that branch of statistics which
deals with the lifeconditions of peoples
DEMOIVRE ABRAHAM 16671754 English mathematician of French
extraction was born at Vitry in Champagne on the 26th of May 1667 He
belonged to a French Protestant family and was compelled to take refuge
in England at the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685 Having
laid the foundation of his mathematical studies in France he prosecuted
them further in London where he read public lectures on natural
philosophy for his support The Principia mathematica of Sir Isaac
Newton which chance threw in his way caused him to prosecute his
studies with vigour and he soon became distinguished among firstrate
mathematicians He was among the intimate personal friends of Newton
and his eminence and abilities secured his admission into the Royal
Society of London in 1697 and afterwards into the Academies of Berlin
and Paris His merit was so well known and acknowledged by the Royal
Society that they judged him a fit person to decide the famous contest
between Newton and G W Leibnitz see INFINITESIMAL CALCULUS The life
of Demoivre was quiet and uneventful His old age was spent in obscure
poverty his friends and associates having nearly all passed away before
him He died at London on the 27th of November 1754
