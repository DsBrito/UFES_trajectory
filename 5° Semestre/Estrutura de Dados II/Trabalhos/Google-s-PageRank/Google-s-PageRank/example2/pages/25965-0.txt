INTRODUCTION
OM
REVERENCE TO GANESHA
The sky is clouded and the wood resembles
The sky thickarched with black TamAla boughs
O Radha Radha take this Soul that trembles
In lifes deep midnight to Thy golden house
So Nanda spokeand led by Radhas spirit
The feet of Krishna found the road aright
Wherefore in bliss which all high hearts inherit
Together taste they Loves divine delight
He who wrote these things for thee
Of the Son of Wassoodee
Was the poet Jayadeva
Him Saraswati gave ever
Fancies fair his mind to throng
Like pictures palacewalls along
Ever to his notes of love
Lakshmis mystic dancers move
If thy spirit seeks to brood
On Hari glorious Hari good
If it feeds on solemn numbers
Dim as dreams and soft as slumbers
Lend thine ear to Jayadev
Lord of all the spells that save
Umapatidharas strain
Glows like roses after rain
Sharans streamlike song is grand
If its tide ye understand
Bard more wise beneath the sun
Is not found than Govardhun
Dhoyi holds the listener still
With his shlokes of subtle skill
But for sweet words suited well
Jayadeva doth excel
What follows is to the Music MALAVA and the Mode RUPAKA
HYMN TO VISHNU
O thou that heldst the blessed Veda dry
When all things else beneath the floods were hurled
Strong FishGod Ark of Men Jai Hari jai
Hail Keshav hail thou Master of the world
The round world rested on thy spacious nape
Upon thy neck like a mere mole it stood
O thou that tookst for us the Tortoiseshape
Hail Keshav hail Ruler of wave and wood
The world upon thy curving tusk sate sure
Like the Moons dark disc in her crescent pale
O thou who didst for us assume the Boar
Immortal Conqueror hail Keshav hail
When thou thy GiantFoe didst seize and rend
Fierce fearful long and sharp were fang and nail
Thou who the Lion and the Man didst blend
Lord of the Universe hail Narsingh hail
Wonderful Dwarfwho with a threefold stride
Cheated King Baliwhere thy footsteps fall
Mens sins O Wamuna are set aside
O Keshav hail thou Help and Hope of all
The sins of this sad earth thou didst assoil
The anguish of its creatures thou didst heal
Freed are we from all terrors by thy toil
Hail Purshuram hail Lord of the biting steel
To thee the fell TenHeaded yielded life
Thou in dread battle laidst the monster low
Ah Rama dear to Gods and men that strife
We praise thee Master of the matchless bow
With clouds for garments glorious thou dost fare
Veiling thy dazzling majesty and might
As when Yamuna saw thee with the share
A peasantyet the King of Day and Night
Mercifulhearted when thou earnest as Boodh
Albeit twas written in the Scriptures so
Thou badst our altars be no more imbrued
With blood of victims Keshav bending low
We praise thee Wielder of the sweeping sword
Brilliant as curving comets in the gloom
Whose edge shall smite the fierce barbarian horde
Hail to thee Keshav hail and hear and come
And fill this song of Jayadev with thee
And make it wise to teach strong to redeem
And sweet to living souls Thou Mystery
Thou Light of Life Thou Dawn beyond the dream
Fish that didst outswim the flood
Tortoise whereon earth hath stood
Boar who with thy tush heldst high
The world that mortals might not die
Lion who hast giants torn
Dwarf who laughdst a king to scorn
Sole Subduer of the Dreaded
Slayer of the manyheaded
Mighty Ploughman Teacher tender
Of thine own the sure Defender
Under all thy ten disguises
Endless praise to thee arises
What follows is to the Music GURJJARA and the Mode NIHSARA
Endless praise arises
O thou God that liest
Rapt on Kumlas breast
Happiest holiest highest
Planets are thy jewels
Stars thy foreheadgems
Set like sapphires gleaming
In kingliest anadems
Even the great gold SunGod
Blazing through the sky
Serves thee but for creststone
Jai jai Hari jai
As that Lord of day
After night brings morrow
Thou dost charm away
Lifes long dream of sorrow
As on Mansas water
Brood the swans at rest
So thy laws sit stately
On a holy breast
O Drinker of the poison
Ah high Delight of earth
What light is to the lotusbuds
What singing is to mirth
Art thouart thou that slayedst
Madhou and Narak grim
That ridest on the King of Birds
Making all glories dim
With eyes like open lotusflowers
Bright in the morning rain
Freeing by one swift piteous glance
The spirit from Lifes pain
Of all the three Worlds Treasure
Of sin the Putterby
Oer the TenHeaded Victor
Jai Hari Hari jai
Thou Shaker of the Mountain
Thou Shadow of the Storm
Thou Cloud that unto Lakshmis face
Comes welcome white and warm
O thouwho to great Lakshmi
Art like the silvery beam
Which moonsick chakors feed upon
By Jumnas silent stream
To thee this hymn ascendeth
That Jayadev doth sing
Of worship love and mystery
High Lord and Heavenly King
And unto whoso hears it
Do thou a blessing bring
Whose neck is gilt with yellow dust
From lilies that did cling
Beneath the breasts of Lakshmi
A girdle soft and sweet
When in divine embracing
The lips of Gods did meet
And the beating heart above
Of theeDread Lord of Heaven
She left that stamp of love
By such deep sign be given
Prays Jayadev the glory
And the secret and the spells
Which closehid in this story
Unto wise ears he tells
END OF INTRODUCTION
SARGA THE FIRST
SAMODADAMODARO
THE SPORTS OF KRISHNA
Beautiful Radha jasminebosomed Radha
All in the Springtime waited by the wood
For Krishna fair Krishna the allforgetful
Krishna with earthly loves false fire consuming
And some one of her maidens sang this song
What follows is to the Music VASANTA and the Mode YATI
I know where Krishna tarries in these early days of Spring
When every wind from warm Malay brings fragrance on its wing
Brings fragrance stolen far away from thickets of the clove
In jungles where the bees hum and the Koil flutes her love
He dances with the dancers of a merry morrice one
All in the budding Springtime for tis sad to be alone
I know how Krishna passes these hours of blue and gold
When parted lovers sigh to meet and greet and closely hold
Hand fast in hand and every branch upon the Vakultree
Droops downward with a hundred blooms in every bloom a bee
He is dancing with the dancers to a laughtermoving tone
In the soft awakening Springtime when tis hard to live alone
Where Kroonaflowers that open at a lovers lightest tread
Break and for shame at what they hear from white blush modest red
And all the spears on all the boughs of all the Ketukglades
Seem ready darts to pierce the hearts of wandering youths and maids
Tis there thy Krishna dances till the merry drum is done
All in the sunny Springtime when who can live alone
Where the breaking forth of blossom on the yellow Keshrasprays
Dazzles like Kamas sceptre whom all the world obeys
And PAtalbuds fill drowsy bees from pink delicious bowls
As Kamas nectared goblet steeps in languor human souls
There he dances with the dancers and of Radha thinketh none
All in the warm new Springtide when none will live alone
Where the breath of waving MAdhvi pours incense through the grove
And silken Mogras lull the sense with essences of love
The silkensoft pale Mogra whose perfume fine and faint
Can melt the coldness of a maid the sternness of a saint
There dances with those dancers thine other self thine Own
All in the languorous Springtime when none will live alone
Whereas if warm lips touched sealed eyes and waked themall the
bloom
Opens upon the mangoes to feel the sunshine come
And Atimuktas wind their arms of softest green about
Clasping the stems while calm and clear great Jumna spreadeth out
There dances and there laughs thy Love with damsels many an one
In the rosy days of Springtime for he will not live alone
Mark this song of Jayadev
Deep as pearl in oceanwave
Lurketh in its lines a wonder
Which the wise alone will ponder
Though it seemeth of the earth
Heavenly is the musics birth
Telling darkly of delights
In the wood of wasted nights
Of witless days and fruitless love
And false pleasures of the grove
And rash passions of the prime
And those dances of Springtime
Time which seems so subtlesweet
Time which pipes to dancingfeet
Ah so softlyah so sweetly
That among those woodmaids featly
Krishna cannot choose but dance
Letting pass lifes greater chance
Yet the winds that sigh so
As they stir the rose
Wake a sigh from Krishna
Wistfuller than those
All their faint breaths swinging
The creepers to and fro
Pass like rustling arrows
Shot from Kamas bow
Thus among the dancers
What those zephyrs bring
Strikes to Krishnas spirit
Like a darted sting
And all as iffar wandered
The traveller should hear
The bird of home the Koil
With nestnotes rich and clear
And there should come one moment
A blessed fleeting dream
Of the bees among the mangoes
Beside his native stream
So flash those sudden yearnings
That sense of a dearer thing
The love and lack of Radha
Upon his soul in Spring
Then she the maid of Radha spake again
And pointing far away between the leaves
Guided her lovely Mistress where to look
And note how Krishna wantoned in the wood
Now with this one now that his heart her prize
Panting with foolish passions and his eyes
Beaming with too much love for those fair girls
Fair but not so as Radha and she sang
What follows is to the Music RAMAGIRA and the Mode YATI
See Lady how thy Krishna passes these idle hours
Decked forth in fold of woven gold and crowned with forestflowers
And scented with the sandal and gay with gems of price
Rubies to mate his laughing lips and diamonds like his eyes
In the company of damsels1 who dance and sing and play
Lies Krishna laughing toying dreaming his Spring away
Footnote 1 It will be observed that the Gopis here personify the
five senses Lassen says Manifestum est puellis istis nil aliud
significar quam res sensiles
One with starblossomed champAk wreathed wooes him to rest his head
On the dark pillow of her breast so tenderly outspread
And oer his brow with roses blown she fans a fragrance rare
That falls on the enchanted sense like rain in thirsty air
While the company of damsels wave many an odorous spray
And Krishna laughing toying sighs the soft Spring away
Another gazing in his face sits wistfully apart
Searching it with those looks of love that leap from heart to heart
Her eyesafire with shy desire veiled by their lashes black
Speak so that Krishna cannot choose but send the message back
In the company of damsels whose bright eyes in a ring
Shine round him with soft meanings in the merry light of Spring
The third one of that dazzling band of dwellers in the wood
Body and bosom panting with the pulse of youthful blood
Leans over him as in his ear a lightsome thing to speak
And then with leafsoft lip imprints a kiss below his cheek
A kiss that thrills and Krishna turns at the silken touch
To give it backah Radha forgetting thee too much
And one with arch smile beckons him away from Jumnas banks
Where the tall bamboos bristle like spears in battleranks
And plucks his cloth to make him come into the mangoshade
Where the fruit is ripe and golden and the milk and cakes are laid
Oh goldenred the mangoes and glad the feasts of Spring
And fair the flowers to lie upon and sweet the dancers sing
Sweetest of all that Temptress who dances for him now
With subtle feet which part and meet in the RAsmeasure slow
To the chime of silver bangles and the beat of roseleaf hands
And pipe and lute and cymbal played by the woodland bands
So that wholly passionladeneye ear sense soul oercome
Krishna is theirs in the forest his heart forgets its home
Krishna made for heavenly things
Mid those woodland singers sings
With those dancers dances featly
Gives back soft embraces sweetly
Smiles on that one toys with this
Glance for glance and kiss for kiss
Meets the merry damsels fairly
Plays the round of folly rarely
Lapped in milkwarm springtime weather
He and those brown girls together
And this shadowed earthly love
In the twilight of the grove
Dance and song and soft caresses
Meeting looks and tangled tresses
Jayadev the same hath writ
That ye might have gain of it
Sagely its deep sense conceiving
And its inner light believing
How that Lovethe mighty Master
Lord of all the stars that cluster
In the sky swiftest and slowest
Lord of highest Lord of lowest
Manifests himself to mortals
Winning them towards the portals
Of his secret House the gates
Of that bright Paradise which waits
The wise in love Ah human creatures
Even your phantasies are teachers
Mighty Love makes sweet in seeming
Even Krishnas woodland dreaming
Mighty Love sways all alike
From self to selflessness Oh strike
From your eyes the veil and see
What Love willeth Him to be
Who in error but in grace
Sitteth with that lotusface
And those eyes whose rays of heaven
Unto phantomeyes are given
Holding feasts of foolish mirth
With these Visions of the earth
Learning love and love imparting
Yet with sense of loss upstarting
For the cloud that veils the fountains
Underneath the Sandal mountains
Howas if the sunshine drew
All its being to the blue
It takes flight and seeks to rise
High into the purer skies
High into the snow and frost
On the shining summits lost
Ah and how the Koils strain
Smites the traveller with pain
When the mango blooms in spring
And Koohoo Koohoo they sing
Pain of pleasures not yet won
Pain of journeys not yet done
Pain of toiling without gaining
Pain mid gladness of still paining
But may He guide us all to glory high
Who laughed when Radha glided hidden by
And all among those damsels free and bold
Touched Krishna with a soft mouth kind and cold
And like the others leaning on his breast
Unlike the others left there Loves unrest
And like the others joining in his song
Unlike the others made him silent long
Here ends that Sarga of the GAta Govinda entitled
SAMODADAMODARO
SARGA THE SECOND
KLESHAKESHAVO
THE PENITENCE OF KRISHNA
Thus lingered Krishna in the deep green wood
And gave himself too prodigal to those
But Radha heartsick at his fallingoff
Seeing her heavenly beauty slighted so
Withdrew and in a bower of Paradise
Where nectarous blossoms wove a shrine of shade
Haunted by birds and bees of unknown skies
She sate deepsorrowful and sang this strain
What follows is to the Music GURJJARA and the Mode YATI
Ah my Beloved taken with those glances
Ah my Beloved dancing those rash dances
Ah Minstrel playing wrongful strains so well
Ah Krishna Krishna with the honeyed lip
Ah Wanderer into foolish fellowship
My Dancer my DelightI love thee still
O Dancer strip thy peacockcrown away
Rise thou whose forehead is the star of day
With beauty for its silver halo set
Come thou whose greatness gleams beneath its shroud
Like Indras rainbow shining through the cloud
Come for I love thee my Beloved yet
Must love theecannot choose but love thee ever
My best Belovedset on this endeavor
To win thy tender heart and earnest eye
From lips but sadly sweet from restless bosoms
To mine O Krishna with the mouth of blossoms
To mine thou soul of Krishna yet I sigh
Half hopeless thinking of myself forsaken
And thee dear Loiterer in the wood oertaken
With passion for those bold and wanton ones
Who knit thine arms as poisonplants gripe trees
With twining cordstheir flowers the braveries
That flash in the green gloom sparkling stars and stones
My Prince my Lotusfaced my woe my love
Whose broad brow with the tilkaspot above
Shames the bright moon at full with fleck of cloud
Thou to mistake so little for so much
Thou Krishna to be palm to palm with such
O Soul made for my joys pure perfect proud
Ah my Beloved in thy darkness dear
Ah Dancer with the jewels in thine ear
Swinging to music of a loveless love
O my Beloved in thy fall so high
That angels sages spirits of the sky
Linger about thee watching in the grove
I will be patient still and draw thee ever
My one Beloved sitting by the river
Under the thick kadambas with that throng
Will there not come an end to earthly madness
Shall I not past the sorrow have the gladness
Must not the lovelight shine for him ere long
Shine thou Light by Radha given
Shine thou splendid star of heaven
Be a lamp to Krishnas feet
Show to all hearts secrets sweet
Of the wonder and the love
Jayadev hath writ above
Be the quick Interpreter
Unto wisest ears of her
Who always sings to all I wait
He loveth still who loveth late
For sang on that high Lady in the shade
My soul for tenderness not blame was made
Mine eyes look through his evil to his good
My heart coins pleas for him my fervent thought
Prevents what he will say when these are naught
And that which I am shall be understood
Then spake she to her maiden wistfully
What follows is to the Music MALAVAGAUDA and the Mode EKATALA
Go to himwin him hitherwhisper low
How he may find me if he searches well
Say if he willjoys past his hope to know
Await him here go now to him and tell
Where Radha is and that henceforth she charms
His spirit to her arms
Yes go say if he will that he may come
May come my love my longing my desire
May come forgiven shriven to me his home
And make his happy peace nay and aspire
To uplift Radhas veil and learn at length
What love is in its strength
Lead him say softly I shall chide his blindness
And vex him with my angers yet add this
He shall not vainly sue for lovingkindness
Nor miss to see me close nor lose the bliss
That lives upon my lip nor be denied
The rosethrone at my side
Say that IRadhain my bower languish
All widowed till he find the way to me
Say that mine eyes are dim my breast all anguish
Until with gentle murmured shame I see
His steps come near his anxious pleading face
Bend for my pardoning grace
While Iwhat did he deem light loves so tender
To tarry for them when the vow was made
To yield him up my bosoms maiden splendour
And fold him in my fragrance and unbraid
My shining hair for him and clasp him close
To the gold heart of his Rose
And sing him strains which only spirits know
And make him captive with the silksoft chain
Of twinnedwings brooding round him and bestow
Kisses of Paradise as pure as rain
My gems my moonlightpearls my girdlegold
Cymbaling music bold
While gained for ever I shall dare to grow
Life to life with him in the realms divine
AndLoves large cup at happy overflow
Yet ever to be filledhis eyes and mine
Will meet in that glad look when Times great gate
