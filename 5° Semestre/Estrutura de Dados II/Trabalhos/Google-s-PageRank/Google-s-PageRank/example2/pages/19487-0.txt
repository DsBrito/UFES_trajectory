HEREFORD CATHEDRAL
CHAPTER I  THE HISTORY OF THE BUILDING
The early history of Hereford like that of the majority of cathedral
churches is veiled in the obscurity of doubtful speculation and shadowy
tradition Although the see had existed from the sixth century it is not
till much later that we have any information concerning the cathedral
itself
From 755 to 794 there reigned in Mercia one of the most powerful and
important rulers of those timesaKing Offa He was a contemporary of
Charles the Great and more than once these two sovereigns exchanged gifts
and letters Under Offa Mercia became the first power in Britain and in
addition to much fighting with the West Saxons and the Kentish men he
wrested a large piece of the country lying west of the Severn from the
Welsh took the chief town of the district which was afterwards called
Shrewsbury and like another Severus made a great dyke from the mouth of
the Wye to that of the Dee which became henceforth the boundary between
Wales and England a position it has held with few changes to the present
day In church history Offa is of no less importance than in secular for
as the most powerful King in England he seems to have determined that
ecclesiastical affairs in this country should be more under his control
or at least supervision than they could possibly be with the Mercian
church subject to the Archbishop of Canterbury In 786 therefore he
persuaded the Pope to create the Archbishopric of Lichfield Although
Canterbury regained its supremacy upon Offaas death when Lichfield was
shorn by a new Pope of its recently acquired honours the position gained
for the latter see by Offa though temporary in itself must have had
lasting and important influence Offa is generally held responsible for
the murder about 793 of Athelberht King of the East Angles who had
been promised his daughter Athelthryth in marriage
Had Athelberht been gifted with a knowledge of future events which would
not have been a more wonderful attribute than many of the virtues which
were ascribed afterwards to his dead body he could hardly have desired a
more glorious fate His murder gained for him martyrdom with its immortal
glory and he could scarce have met his death under happier auspices
Visiting a kingas residence to fetch his bride he died by the order of a
man whose memory is sullied by no other stain a man renowned in war a
maker of laws for the good of his people and eminent in an ignorant age
as one who encouraged learning
Legend and tradition have so obscured this event that beyond the bare fact
of the murder nothing can be positively asserted and the brief statement
of the AngloSaxon Chronicle 792 This year Offa King of the Mercians
commanded the head of King Athelberht to be struck off contains all that
we may be certain of
One writer speaks of a hired assassin and others lay the crime at the
door of Cynethryth Offaas Queen who is said to have insinuated that the
marriage was only sought as a pretext to occupy the Mercian throne
Finding her lordas courage not equal to the occasion she herself arranged
the end of Athelberht There is talk of a pit dug in his sleepingchamber
and a chair arranged thereover which with an appearance of luxurious
comfort lured him to his fate The body was according to one writer
privately buried on the bank of the river Lugg near Hereford
On the night of his burial says the Monkish Annalist a column of
light brighter than the sun arose towards heaven and three nights
afterwards the figure or ghost of King Athelberht appeared to Brithfrid
a nobleman and commanded him to convey the body to a place called
Stratus Waye and to inter it near the monastery there Guided by
another column of light Brithfrid having placed the body and the head on
a carriage proceeded on his journey The head fell from the vehicle but
having been discovered by a blind man to whom it miraculously
communicated sight was restored by him to the careless driver Arrived at
his place of destination then called Fernlega or Saltus Silicis and
which has since been termed Hereford he there interred the body Whatever
the motive for the crime there is ample evidence of Offaas subsequent
remorse  In atonement he built monasteries and churches and is even said
by some to have gone on a pilgrimage to Rome though this rests on slight
evidence
The miracles worked at the tomb of the murdered King were according to
Asser so numerous and incredible that Offa who had appropriated
Athelberhtas kingdom was induced to send two bishops to Hereford to
ascertain the truth of them and it is generally agreed that about AD
825 Milfrid who was Viceroy to the Mercian King Egbert after the death of
Offa and of his son Egfrid expended a large sum of money in building
Ecclesiam egregiam lapidea structura at Hereford which he
consecrated to the martyred monarch and endowed with lands and enriched
with ornaments
Although one of the old chroniclers calls it a church of stone it is
quite uncertain what were the materials size or architectural character
of this edifice It seems however that by 1012 when Bishop Athelstan
was promoted to the see it had fallen into sheer ruin or at any rate
sufficient decay to necessitate his beginning a new building Of this no
clearer account has been handed down to us than of Milfridas church Soon
after it was finished Algar or Elfgar Earl of Chester son of the Earl of
Mercia was charged with treason at a Witan in London and though his
guilt is still disputed was outlawed by Edward the Confessor He hired a
fleet of Danish pirate ships from the Irish coast joined King Gruffydd in
Wales and marched with him into Herefordshire determining to make war
upon King Edward Here they began with a victory about two miles from
Hereford over the Earl of that shire who was a Frenchman and tried to
make his men fight on horseback in the French fashion which they did not
understandathe English way being for the great men to ride to the field
of battle but there to dismount and fight with their heavy axes on foot
Earl Ralph the Frenchman turned his horseas head and fled the field and
the English encumbered with their long spears and swords followed helter
skelter After killing some five hundred Alfgar and Gruffydd turned to
Hereford and came upon the church which Bishop Athelstan had caused to be
built There they met with a spirited resistance amongst other victims
seven of the canons were killed in an attempt to hold the great door of
the minster but ultimately the church and town were burned
Earl Harold son of Earl Godwin himself when it was too late came with
half of his army to Hereford and with his usual predilection for peace
notwithstanding his valour soon after removed the outlawry from Alfgar
and quiet was restored
In 1056 the year following this disaster the worthy Bishop Athelstan
died at Bosbury He had been blind for thirteen years before his death
and a Welsh bishop had acted for him His body was interred in the church
which he had built from the foundations and we may therefore suppose
that the minster was not entirely destroyed
In 1057 on the death of Earl Ralph the Frenchman so important was
Herefordshire through its position on the Welsh borders and since it
had been strengthened by Harold such an important military post was the
town of Hereford that it became part of his earldom
From 1055 to 1079 the minster is said to have been in ruins At the latter
date Bishop Lozing Robert de Losinga began to rebuild the cathedral and
there are vague accounts that it was in the form of a round church in
imitation of a basilica of Charlemagne which had been built at
AixlaChapelle between 774 and 795 If such a form ever existed it must
have been completely destroyed as the work of the Norman period that
remains is clearly English both in treatment and in detail If this could
be proved to be Lozingas work then it had no similarity to the Roman
style The building begun by him was carried on by Bishop Raynelm who
held the see from 1107 to 1115 and placed on a more regular basis the
establishment of canons living under a rule These prebendaries or canons
did not live in common like the monks but in separate houses near the
church Whether he completed the building or not Bishop Raynelm
undoubtedly made many additions and alterations
We may here quote an interesting account of the duties of the cathedral
treasurer which were probably settled about this time They throw a
curious and suggestive light on the ceremonies of the period At
Hereford says Walcott he found all the lights three burning day and
night before the high altar two burning there at matins daily and at
mass and the chief hours on festivals three burning perpetually viz
in the chapterhouse the second before S Maryas altar and the third
before the cross in the roodloft four before the high altar and altar
on Minus Duplicia and five tapers in basons on principles and
doubles at mass prime and second vespers four tapers before the high
altar five in the basons thirteen on the beam and seven in the
candelabra the paschal and portable tapers for processions He kept the
keys of the treasury copes palls vestments ornaments and the plate
of which he rendered a yearly account to the dean and chapter He found
three clerks to ring the bells light the candles and suspend the palls
and curtains on solemn days He found hay at Christmas to strew the choir
and chapterhouse which at Easter was sprinkled with ivy leaves and on
All Saintsa day he provided mats1
The next great changes were made under Bishop William de Vere 11861199
His work was of transitional character and bears much resemblance to the
beautiful transitional work at Glastonbury He removed the three Norman
apsidal terminations at the east end doubled the presbytery aisles thus
making two side chapels in each transept which have since been replaced by
the Lady Chapel with its vestibule
In a paper read before the ArchAological Institute in 1877 Sir G G
Scott suggests that the central apse projected one bay beyond the sides
but this is merely conjecture A curious feature in De Vereas work was his
putting columns in the middle of the central arch It is probable that the
part of the presbytery we now have was but the beginning of a larger
scheme never carried out which included building the presbytery and
dividing the eastern wall into two arches instead of one as at Lichfield
and Exeter
According to Sir Gilbert Scottas theory the Early English Lady Chapel was
an extension of the work of Bishop de Vere it is especially interesting
and an unique example of its date in being raised upon a crypt
At the Bishopas palace was a splendid hall of which it seems likely De
Vere was the builderaat any rate he must have been the first or second
occupier It was of noble dimensions being 110 feet in length consisting
of a nave 23 feet broad with aisles 16 feet wide independently of the
columns This was divided into five bays by pillars supporting timber
arches formed of two pieces of curved oak Nearly the whole of the present
Bishopas palace is included within the space occupied by this grand hall
In 1188 when Archbishop Baldwin made pilgrimage into Wales on behalf of
the crusade he was entertained in this hall by Bishop de Vere and
doubtless some of those who devoted themselves to the work were Hereford
men
The central tower of the cathedral that fine example of decorated work
covered with its profusion of ballflower ornament was built by or at
any rate during the episcopate of Giles de Braose 12001215 an ardent
opponent of King John
The remaining examples of decorated date are the inner north porch as
distinct from the addition of Bishop Booth and what remains of the
beautifully designed chapterhouse a decagon in plan each side except
the one occupied by the entrance being subdivided into five seats
During the term of office of Bishop Foliot 12191234 a tooth of St
Athelberht whose remains had been almost entirely destroyed by Alfgar and
Gruffuth in 1055 was given to the cathedral The donor of this precious
relic was Philip de Fauconberg Canon of Hereford and Archdeacon of
Huntingdon
The next Bishop Ralph de Maydenstan 12341239 presented some
servicebooks to the cathedral
In 1240 Henry III with his wonted preference for foreigners appointed
to the Hereford bishopric Peter of Savoy generally known as Bishop
Aquablanca from Aqua Bella his birthplace near ChambAry He it was who
rebuilt the north transept He was one of the best hated men in England
and not content with showering benefices upon his relations he
perpetrated one of the greatest frauds in history in order to raise money
to aid the annexation schemes of Popes Innocent IV and Alexander IV Of
these however full particulars will be found in a chapter on the
Diocese
While he was absent in Ireland collecting tithes attended by a guard of
soldiers Prince Edward coming to Hereford to resist the encroachments of
Llewellyn King of Wales found there neither bishop dean nor canons
resident For this they earned the severe reprimand of the King and the
Bishop returned to Hereford Shortly after he was seized within the
cathedral precincts by the insurgent barons of Leicesteras party together
with all the foreign canons who were his own relations They were
carried to Eardisley Castle where the spoil they had just brought from
Ireland was divided among the insurgents
Bishop Aquablanca died soon after these events in 1268 He was endowed
with a character full of contradictions extreme aggressiveness mingled
with remarkable tact
When he got the better of the Hereford citizens after their attempt to
encroach upon his episcopal rights he remitted one full half of their
fine and devoted the other to the cathedral building While he was showing
in his life a disgraceful example to the clergy of the country at the
same time he gave liberally to the cathedral foundation in books
ornaments money and land left a rich legacy to the poor and a lasting
monument in the rebuilding of the north transept of the cathedral itself
With the exception of the arches leading into the aisles of the nave and
choir the Norman work of the transept was altogether demolished and
replaced by another consisting of two bays with an eastern aisle Over the
latter was built a story now used as the cathedral library which is
approached from the north aisle of the presbytery by a staircase turret
His tomb is one of the finest in the cathedral Under it together with
those of his nephew a Dean of Hereford are his own remains except the
heart which as he had wished was carried to his own country of Savoy
In 1275 the Chapter of Hereford elected to the bishopric Thomas de
Cantilupe one of the greatest men who has ever held that office a man
whose life was in almost every way a remarkable contrast to that of his
predecessor Bishop Aquablanca It is said that the Bishop of Worcester
his greatuncle asked him as a child as to his choice of a profession
and that he answered he would like to be a soldier Then sweetheart
his uncle is said to have exclaimed thou shalt be a soldier to serve the
King of Kings and fight under the banner of the glorious martyr St
Thomas Regular attendance at mass was his custom from earliest years
Both at Oxford and Paris he distinguished himself gaining his degree of
MA at the Sorbonne and on his return accepted at the request of the
university of Oxford and with the consent of the King the office of
chancellor In this capacity he showed singular courage and determination
in repressing a brawl between the southern scholars and those of the
north in which we are told he escaped with a whole skin but not with a
whole coat
He was chosen to fill the post of Chancellor of England under Simon de
Montfort at whose death however he was deprived of the office It was
some years after this that he became Bishop of Hereford and was
consecrated at Canterbury September 8th 1275 No Welsh bishop attended
the consecration
After he became a bishop he still wore his hairshirt and showed ever
intense devotion in his celebration of divine service He was remarkable
in the steadfastness and ability he displayed in maintaining the rights of
the see Gilbert de Clare Earl of Gloucester claiming a certain chace
near Malvern Forest whence came the Bishopas supply of game found a
relentless opponent in Bishop Cantilupe The Bishop was prepared with the
customary pugil or champion who received 6s 8d per annum though his
services were not required The Earl was excommunicated and appealing to
the law in a trial Bishop Cantilupe eloquently maintained his right to
capture buck doe fawn wild cat hare and all birds pertaining
thereto and as a result of the verdict being in his favour caused a
long trench to be dug on the crest of the Malvern Hills as a boundary
line which is still traceable
Llewellyn King of Wales was made to restore three manors of which he had
obtained unlawful possession and Lord Clifford for cattlelifting and
maltreating the Bishopas tenants was compelled to walk barefoot to the
high altar in the cathedral while the Bishop personally chastised him
with a rod
Many cases did he fight out successfully but his greatest struggle was on
a question of testamentary jurisdiction with Peckham Archbishop of
Canterbury by whom he was ultimately excommunicated and obliged to leave
the country attended by Swinfield his faithful chaplain
He obtained a decree in his favour from Pope Martin IV but died on the
homeward journey on August 25th 1282 He was buried in the church of St
Severus near Florence but his bones having been divided from the flesh
by boiling were later carried to England and solemnly placed in the Lady
Chapel of the cathedral It is said that the Earl of Gloucester with whom
Bishop Cantilupe had had the dispute about the chace attended the
ceremony and that blood began to flow from the bones when he approached
the casket containing them upon which the Earl immediately restored the
property he had taken unjustly from the church
Forty years later Bishop Cantilupe was canonised It is said amongst
other evidences of his saintliness that he never allowed his sister to
kiss him Three hundred sick people are said to have been cured at the
place of his interment and so many candles were presented by the crowds
of visitors that Luke de Bray the treasurer of the cathedral had a
dispute with the prebendaries as to the value of the wax twothirds being
finally assigned to the treasurer and onethird to the prebendaries
After five years Bishop Cantilupeas bones were removed to the Chapel of
St Katherine in the northwest transept on Maundy Thursday April 6th
1287 in presence of King Edward I They were again twice moved in the
sixteenth century to the Lady Chapel and back again to the northwest
transept
The building of the chapterhouse may have spread over some part of
Cantilupeas episcopate and probably part of the cloisters were erected
about this time
The miracles said to have been wrought at the shrine of St Cantilupe are
both many and various More than sixtysix dead people are said to have
been restored to life The saintas intervention appears to have been
extended even to animals as we find that King Edward I twice sent sick
falcons to be cured at this tomb So great was the reverence for the saint
that the See of Hereford was allowed by the Crown to change its armorial
bearings for the arms of Cantilupe which all its bishops have since
borne
Bishop Cantilupe was succeeded by his devoted chaplain Richard Swinfield
an excellent preacher and a man of agreeable manners Bishop Swinfield
like his predecessor stoutly vindicated the rights and discipline of his
diocese once against a layman for taking forcible possession of a vacant
benefice another time against a lady for imprisoning a young clergyman in
her castle on a false charge and also against the people of Ludlow for
violating the right of sanctuary and in many cases against abuses of all
sorts On one occasion Pontius de Cors a nephew of Bishop Aquablanca who
had obtained from the Pope the provision of the prebend of Hinton
interrupted the installation of Robert de Shelving appointed by Bishop
Swinfield gained admission to the cathedral with an accomplice and was
formally installed by him in spite of the remonstrance of the Chapter He
held his place by force of arms during that day and the next but later
submitted to the Bishop
Bishop Swinfield was probably the builder of the naveaisles and of the
two easternmost transepts This amounted to a remodelling of the work of
De Vere The bases of his piers and responds were retained and may still
be seen and upon the former octagonal columns were erected to carry the
vaulting The windows were altered throughout It was in his time that the
Mappa Mundi the curious map of the world designed by Richard of
Haldingham of Battle in Sussex a prebendary of Hereford in 1305 now
preserved in the cathedral came into possession of the Chapter
Richard Haldingham was a great friend of Bishop Swinfield and when it was
necessary for him to send representatives to a provincial Council in
London AD 1313 Haldingham was deputed to attend with Adam of Orleton
a place belonging to the Mortimers of Wigmore in the northeast of
Herefordshire
Three years later 1316 on the death of Bishop Swinfield at his chief
residence Bosbury Adam of Orleton succeeded him in the bishopric
King Edward II was not jubilant over the appointment of a friend of Roger
Mortimer to this important position and failing to persuade Adam to
decline the bishopric he appealed to the Pope begging him to cancel the
appointment but with no more success The fortunes of the Bishop of
Hereford became identified with the Queen whom he joined on her return
from France with her eldest son It was at Hereford that this youth then
fourteen years of age was appointed guardian of the kingdom under the
direction of his mother
The King who had sought refuge in Wales was captured at Neath Abbey and
the great seal taken from him by Bishop Adam Orleton while the
Chancellor Hugh Despenser was conveyed to Hereford where he was crowned
with nettles and dressed in a shirt upon which was written passages from
Psalm lii beginning Why boastest thou thyself thou tyrant that thou
canst do mischief Amid the howlings of a great multitude who mocked his
name by shrieking Hue he was finally hanged on a gallows 50 feet high
and then quartered Among the prisoners were two wearing holy orders and
these the Bishop of Hereford claimed as his perquisite

Bishop Adam wary unscrupulous but at the same time vigorous and of
unusual ability played a great part in politics to the end of the
wretched Kingas life Some historians still believe that he recommended
the murder he certainly supported the deposition in Parliament and went
to Kenilworth as one of the commissioners to force the Kingas resignation
If thus interested in secular politics he was no less watchful and
vigilant in the affairs of his bishopric and the cathedral
The great central tower destined centuries later to be a source of such
anxiety and a problem of such difficulty to the restorer was even at this
early date showing signs of dilapidation and Bishop Orleton obtained from
Pope John XXII a grant of the great tithes of Shenyngfeld Swinfield and
Swalefeld Swallowfield in Berkshire in answer to the following
petitionaThat they being desirous of rebuilding a portion of the fabric
of the Church of Hereford had caused much superstructure of sumptuous
work to be built to the adornment of the House of God upon an ancient
foundation which in the judgment of masons or architects who were
considered skilful in their art was thought to be firm and sound at the
cost of 20000 marcs sterling and more and that on account of the
weakness of the aforesaid foundation the building which was placed upon
it now threatened such ruin that by a similar judgment no other remedy
could be applied short of an entire renovation of the fabric from the
foundationawhich on account of the expenses incurred in prosecution of
the canonisation of Thomas de Cantilupe Bishop of Hereford of blessed
memory they were unable to undertake The sumptuous work alluded to
was evidently the central tower and the north transept which latter had
been built as mentioned before for the remains and shrine of Bishop
Cantilupe
When Mr R Biddulph Phillips some sixty years ago was examining the
confused and unsorted mass of charters and grants in the possession of the
cathedral he found a parchment which bore the two beautiful episcopal
seals of Bishop Roger le Poer of Sarum and Bishop Adam de Orleton of
Hereford that acknowledged and confirmed this grant of tithes to the
sustentation of the fabric of the cathedral which still forms the
backbone of the fabric fund In 1328 Bishop Orleton was translated to
Worcester
During the ensuing war with France the church walls echoed with prayers
for the Kingas success and while the warcloud still darkened the
political sky orisons louder and more heartfelt filled the cathedral It
is said that when the Black Death reached Hereford in 1349 to retard
its progress in the city the shrine of St Thomas de Cantilupe was carried
in procession
About this time and possibly not unconnected with the calamity of this
terrible plague Bishop Trilleck issued a mandate prohibiting the
performance of theatrical plays and interludes in churches as contrary
to the practice of religion The exact character of these performances is
doubtful and the prohibition may have referred to some kind of secular
mumming The mystery play survived long after Bishop Trilleckas time in an
annual pageant exhibited in the cathedral on Corpus Christi Day to assist
in which some of the city guilds were obliged by the rules of their
incorporation
The quarrels between the townspeople and the Bishop about his rights of
jurisdiction continued with more or less frequency It must certainly have
been irritating to good Bishop Trilleck gratus prudens pius as the
mutilated inscription on his effigy describes him when one William Corbet
forced his way into the palace carried away the porter bodily shut him
in the city gaol and took away the keys of the palace
On the second visitation of the Black Death 13612 it is said that the
city market was removed from Hereford to a place about a mile on the west
of the town still marked by a cross called the White Cross bearing the
arms of Bishop Charleton
If Bishop Orleton was deeply concerned in the deposition of King Edward
II a later Bishop of Hereford Thomas Trevenant who was appointed in
1389 by papal provision was no less active in the deposition of King
Richard II and was sent to the Pope with the Archbishop of York by Henry
IV to explain his title to the Crown and announce his accession
In 1396 during the episcopate of Bishop Gilbert the priest vicars of the
cathedral were formed into a college by Royal Charter and the first
warden or custos was appointed by the King to show that the right of
appointment was vested in the Crown The college was to have a common
seal and to exercise the right of acquiring and holding property but to
be subject to the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral Its members were the
priests of the chantry chapels in the cathedral at this time apparently
twentyseven in number
In 1475 the college was moved from Castle Street to its present site so
that the vicars should be able more comfortably to attend the night
services An order was also made about this time concerning the
celebration of mass at the altar of St John Baptist in the cathedral an
arrangement which shows that then as now the parish of St John had no
church of its own outside the cathedral walls
About 1418 the cloister connecting the Bishopas palace with the cathedral
was begun by Bishop Lacy who took great interest in the cathedral
although he never visited his diocese It was upon this work of the
cloisters that 2800 marks were expended by Bishop Spofford 14211448 in
whose time the great west window was erected by William Lochard the
precentor The richly panelled and vaulted chapel of Bishop Stanbury
approached from the north aisle of the presbytery was added between 1453
and 1474
In 1492 Edmund Audley the Bishop of Rochester was translated to
Hereford and during his episcopate founded the twostoried chantry chapel
south of the Lady Chapel and near the shrine of St Thomas of Cantilupe
The upper story was probably intended as a private oratory for the Bishop
himself Bishop Audley also presented to the cathedral a silver shrine

The next important alteration was the lengthening of the great north porch
which bears the date 1519 and the shields of Bishop Booth and his
predecessor Bishop Mayo It is a very fine piece of Perpendicular work
somewhat similar in design to the porch in the middle of the west front of
Peterborough Cathedral At his death Bishop Booth left various books to
the cathedral library and some tapestry for the high altar together with
silver and gold ornaments for the Cantilupe Shrine The tapestry displayed
the story of David and Nabal He also bequeathed amongst other things to
his successor the gold ring with which he was consecrated but
