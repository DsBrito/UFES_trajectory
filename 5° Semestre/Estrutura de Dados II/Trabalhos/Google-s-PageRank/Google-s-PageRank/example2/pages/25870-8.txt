CHAPTER I
GOODBYE TO THE OLD LIFE
Me want to see Hetty said an imperious baby voice
No no not this morning Miss Nan dear
Me do want to see Hetty was the quick impatient reply And a sturdy
indignant little face looked up at Nurse to watch the effect of the last
decisive words
Finding no affirmative reply on Nurses placid face the small lips
closed firmlytwo dimples came and went on two very round cheeksthe
mischievous brown eyes grew full of laughter and the next moment the
little questioner had squeezed her way through a slightly open door and
was toddling down the broad stone stairs and across a landing to Hettys
room The roomdoor was open so the truant went in A bed with the
bedclothes all tossed about a half wornout slipper on the floor a
very untidy dressingtable met her eyes but no Hetty
Me want Hetty me do piped the treble voice and then the little feet
commenced a careful and watchful pilgrimage the lips still firmly shut
the dimples coming and going and the eyes throwing many upward glances
in the direction of Nurse and the nursery
No pursuit as yet and great great hope of finding Hetty somewhere in
the downstair regions Ah now how good those dangerous stairs had
been descended and the little voice calling in shrill tones for Hetty
rang out in the wide hall
Let her come to me suddenly said an answering voice and a girl of
about twelve dressed in deep mourning suddenly opened the door of a
small study and clasped the little one in her arms
So you have found me my precious my dearest Brave plucky little Nan
you have got away from Nurse and found me out Come into the study now
darling and you shall have some breakfast
Me want a bicky Hetty said the baby voice the round arms clasped
Hesters neck but the brown eyes were already traveling eagerly over the
breakfast table in quest of spoil for those rosy little lips
Here are two biscuits Nan Nan look me in the facehere sit steady
on my knee you love me dont you Nan
Course me do said the child
And Im going away from you Nan darling For months and months I wont
see anything of you My heart will be always with you and I shall think
of you morning noon and night I love no one as I love you Nan You
will think of me and love me too wont you Nan
Me will said Nan me want more bicky Hetty
Yes yes answered Hester put your arms tight round my neck and you
shall have sugar too Tighter than that Nan and you shall have two
lumps of sugaroh yes you shallI dont care if it makes you
sickyou shall have just what you want the last moment we are together
Baby Nan was only too pleased to crumple up a crape frill and to smear a
black dress with sticky little fingers for the sake of the sugar which
Hetty plied her with
More Hetty she said mell skeeze oo vedy tight for more
On this scene Nurse unexpectedly entered
Well I never and so you found your way all downstairs by yourself you
little toddle Now Miss Hetty I hope you havent been giving the
precious lamb sugar you know it never does suit the little dear Oh
fie baby and what sticky hands Miss Hetty she has crumpled all your
crape frills
What matter said Hester I wanted a good hug and I gave her three or
four lumps Babies wont squeeze you tight for nothing There my Nancy
go back to Nurse Nurse take her away Ill break down in a minute if I
see her looking at me with that little pout
Nurse took the child into her arms
Goodbye Miss Hester dear Try to be a good girl at school Take my
word missythings wont be as dark as they seem
Goodbye Nurse said Hester hastily Is that you father are you
calling me
She gathered up her muff and gloves and ran out of the little study
where she had been making believe to eat breakfast A tall sternlooking
man was in the hall buttoning on an overcoat a brougham waited at the
door The next moment Hester and her father were bowling away in the
direction of the nearest railway station Nans little chubby face had
faded from view The old square gray house sacred to Hester because of
Nan had also disappeared the avenue even was passed and Hester closed
her bright brown eyes She felt that she was being pushed out into a cold
world and was no longer in the same snug nest with Nan An intolerable
pain was at her heart she did not glance at her father who during their
entire drive occupied himself over his morning paper At last they
reached the railway station and just as Sir John Thornton was handing
his daughter into a comfortable firstclass carriage marked For Ladies
only and was presenting her with her railway ticket and a copy of the
last weeks illustrated newspaper he spoke
The guard will take care of you Hester I am giving him full
directions and he will come to you at every station and bring you tea
or any refreshment you may require This train takes you straight to
Sefton and Mrs Willis will meet you or send for you there Goodbye
my love try to be a good girl and curb your wild spirits I hope to see
you very much improved when you come home at midsummer Goodbye dear
goodbye Ah you want to kiss mewell just one kiss Thereoh my
dear you know I have a great dislike to emotion in public
Sir John Thornton said this because a pair of arms had been flung
suddenly round his neck and two kisses imprinted passionately on his
sallow cheek A tear also rested on his cheek but that he wiped away
CHAPTER II
TRAVELING COMPANIONS
The train moved rapidly on its way and the girl in one corner of the
railway carriage cried silently behind her crape veil Her tears were
very subdued but her heart felt sore bruised indignant she hated the
idea of schoollife before her she hated the expected restraints and the
probable punishments she fancied herself going from a free life into a
prison and detested it accordingly
Three months before Hester Thornton had been one of the happiest
brightest and merriest of little girls in shire but the mother who
was her guardian angel who had kept the frank and spirited child in
check without appearing to do so who had guided her by the magical power
of love and not in the least by that of fear had met her death suddenly
by means of a carriage accident and Hester and baby Nan were left
motherless Several little brothers and sisters had come between Hester
and Nan but from various causes they had all died in their infancy and
only the eldest and youngest of Sir John Thorntons family remained
Hesters father was stern uncompromising He was a very just and upright
man but he knew nothing of the ways of children and when Hester in her
usual tomboyish fashion climbed trees and tore her dresses and rode
barebacked on one or two of his most dangerous horses he not only tried
a little sharp and therefore useless correction but determined to take
immediate steps to have his wild and rather unmanageable little daughter
sent to a firstclass school Hester was on her way there now and very
sore was her heart and indignant her impulses Fathers goodbye seemed
to her to be the crowning touch to her unhappiness and she made up her
mind not to be good not to learn her lessons not to come home at
midsummer crowned with honors and reduced to an everyday and pattern
little girl No she would be the same wild Hetty as of yore and when
father saw that school could do nothing for her that it could never make
her into a good and ordinary little girl he would allow her to remain at
home At home there was at least Nan to love and there was mother to
remember
Hetty was a child of the strongest feelings Since her mothers death she
had scarcely mentioned her name When her father alluded to his wife
Hester ran out of the room when the servants spoke of their late
mistress Hester turned pale stamped her feet and told them to be
quiet
You are not worthy to speak of my mother she electrified them all one
day by exclaiming My mother is an angel now and youoh you are not
fit to breathe her name
Only to one person would Hetty ever voluntarily say a word about the
beloved dead mother and that was to little Nan Nan said her prayers as
she expressed it to Hetty now and Hetty taught her a little phrase to
use instead of the familiar God bless mother She taught the child to
say Thank God for making mother into a beautiful angel and when Nan
asked what an angel was and how the cozy mother she remembered could be
turned into one Hester was beguiled into a soft and tearful talk and
she drew several lovely pictures of whiterobed angels until the little
child was satisfied and said
Me like that Hettymell be an angel too Hetty same as mamma
These talks with Nan however did not come very often and of late they
had almost ceased for Nan was only two and a half and the strange sad
fact remained that in three months she had almost forgotten her mother
Hester on her way to school this morning cried for some time then she
sat silent her crape veil still down and her eyes watching furtively
her fellowpassengers They consisted of two rather fidgety old ladies
who wrapped themselves in rugs were very particular on the question of
hot bottles and watched Hester in their turn with considerable curiosity
and interest Presently one of them offered the little girl a sandwich
which she was too proud or too shy to accept although by this time she
was feeling extremely hungry
You will perhaps prefer a cake my dear said the goodnatured little
old lady My sister Agnes has got some delicious queencakes in her
basketwill you eat one
Hester murmured a feeble assent and the queencake did her so much good
that she ventured to raise her crape veil and to look around her
Ah that is much better said the first little old lady Come to this
side of the carriage my love we are just going to pass through a lovely
bit of country and you will like to watch the view See if you place
yourself here my sister Agnes basket will be just at your feet and you
can help yourself to a queencake whenever you are so disposed
Thank you responded Hester in a much more cheerful tone for it was
really quite impossible to keep up reserve with such a brightlooking
little old lady your queencakes are very nice and I liked that one
but one is quite enough thank you It is Nan who is so particularly fond
of queencakes
And who is Nan my dear asked the sister to whom the queencakes
specially belonged
She is my dear little baby sister said Hester in a sorrowful tone
Ah and it was about her you were crying just now said the first lady
laying her hand on Hesters arm Never mind us dear we have seen a
great many tearsa great many They are the way of the world Women are
born to them As Kingsley sayswomen must weep It was quite natural
that you should cry about your sweet little Nan and I wish we could send
her some of these queencakes that you say she is so fond of Are you
going to be long away from her love
Oh yes for months and months said Hester I did not know she
added that it was such a common thing to cry I never used to
Ah you have had other trouble poor child glancing at her deep
mourning frock
Yes it is since then I have cried so often Please I would rather not
speak about it
Quite right my love quite right said Miss Agnes in a much brisker
tone than her sister We will turn the conversation now to something
inspiriting Jane is quite right there are plenty of tears in the world
but there is also a great deal of sunshine and heaps of laughter merry
laughterthe laughter of youth my child Now I dare say though you
have begun your journey so sadly that you are really bound on quite a
pleasant little expedition For instance you are going to visit a kind
aunt or some one else who will give you a delightful welcome
No said Hester I am not I am going to a dreadful place and the
thought of that and parting from little Nan are the reasons why I
cried I am going to prisonI am indeed
Oh my dear love exclaimed both the little old ladies in a breath
Then Miss Agnes continued You have really taken Janes breath
awayquite Yes Jane I see that you are in for an attack of
palpitation Never mind her dear she palpitates very easily but I
think you must be mistaken my love in mentioning such an appalling word
as prison Yes now I come to think of it it is absolutely certain
that you must be mistaken for if you were going to such a terrible place
of punishment you would be under the charge of a policeman You are given
to strong language dear like other young folk
Well I call it prison continued Hester who was rather flattered by
all this bustle and Miss Janes agitation it has a dreadful sound
hasnt it I call it prison but father says I am going to schoolyou
cant wonder that I am crying can you Oh what is the matter
For the two little old ladies jumped up at this juncture and gave Hetty
a kiss apiece on her soft young lips
My darling they both exclaimed we are so relieved and delighted
Your strong language startled us and school is anything but what you
imagine dear Ah Jane can you ever forget our happy days at school
Miss Jane sighed and rolled up her eyes and then the two commenced a
vigorous catechizing of the little girl Really Hester could not help
feeling almost sunshiny before that long journey came to an end for she
and the Misses Bruce made some delightful discoveries The little old
ladies very quickly found out that they lived close to the school where
Hetty was to spend the next few months They knew Mrs Willis wellthey
knew the delightful rambling oldfashioned house where Hester was to
livethey even knew two or three of the scholars and they said so often
to the little girl that she was going into a life of cloverpositive
cloverthat she began to smile and even partly to believe them
I am glad I shall be near you at least she said at last with a frank
sweet smile for she had greatly taken to her kind fellowtravelers
Yes my dear exclaimed Miss Jane We attend the same church and I
shall look out for you on Sunday and she continued glancing first at
her sister and then addressing Hester perhaps Mrs Willis will allow
you to visit us occasionally
Ill come tomorrow if you like said Hester
Well dear wellthat must be as Mrs Willis thinks best Ah here we
are at Sefton at last We shall look out for you in church on Sunday my
love
CHAPTER III
AT LAVENDER HOUSE
Hesters journey had really proved wonderfully agreeable She had taken a
great fancy to the little old ladies who had fussed over her and made
themselves pleasant in her behalf She felt herself something like a
heroine as she poured out a little just a little of her troubles into
their sympathizing ears and their cheerful remarks with regard to school
and schoollife had caused her to see clearly that there might be another
and a brighter side to the gloomy picture she had drawn with regard to
her future
But during the drive of two and a half miles from Sefton to Lavender
House Hester once more began to feel anxious and troubled The Misses
Bruce had gone off with some other passengers in a little omnibus to
their small villa in the town but Lavender House was some distance off
and the little omnibus never went so far
An oldfashioned carriage which the ladies told Hester belonged to Mrs
Willis had been sent to meet her and a man whom the Misses Bruce
addressed as Thomas helped to place her trunk and a small portmanteau
on the roof of the vehicle The little girl had to take her drive alone
and the rather ancient horse which drew the old carriage climbed up and
down the steep roads in a most leisurely fashion It was a cold winters
day and by the time Thomas had executed some commissions in Sefton and
had reached the gates of the avenue which led to Lavender House it was
very nearly dark Hester trembled at the darkness and when the gates
were shut behind them by a rosyfaced urchin of ten she once more began
to feel the cruel and desolate idea that she was going to prison
They drove slowly down a long and winding avenue and although Hester
could not see she knew they must be passing under trees for several
times their branches made a noise against the roof of the carriage At
last they came to a standstill The old servant scrambled slowly down
from his seat on the box and opening the carriagedoor held out his
hand to help the little stranger to alight
Come now missy he said in cheering tones come out and youll be
warm and snug in a minute Dear dear I expect youre nearly froze up
poor little miss and it is a most bitter cold night
He rang a bell which hung by the entrance of a deep porch and the next
moment the wide halldoor was flung open by a neat maidservant and
Hester stepped within
Shes come exclaimed several voices in different keys and proceeding
apparently from different quarters Hester looked around her in a
halfstartled way but she could see no one except the maid who smiled
at her and said
Welcome to Lavender House miss If youll step into the porters room
for one moment there is a good fire there and Ill acquaint Miss
Danesbury that you have arrived
The little room in question was at the right hand side of a very wide and
cheerful hall which was decorated in pale tints of green and had a
handsome encaustictiled floor A blazing fire and two lamps made the
hall look cheerful but Hester was very glad to take refuge from the
unknown voices in the porters small room She found herself quite
trembling with shyness and cold and an indescribable longing to get back
to Nan and as she waited for Miss Danesbury and wondered fearfully who
or what Miss Danesbury was she scarcely derived any comfort from the
blazing fire near which she stood
Rather tall for her age but I fear I greatly fear a little sulky
said a voice behind her and when she turned round in an agony of
trepidation and terror she suddenly found herself face to face with a
tall kindlooking middleaged lady and also with a bright
gypsylooking girl
Annie Forest how very naughty of you to hide behind the door You are
guilty of disobedience in coming into this room without leave I must
report you my dear yes I really must You lose two good conduct marks
for this and will probably have thirty lines in addition to your usual
quantity of French poetry
But she wont tell on me she wont dear old Danesbury said the girl
she couldnt be so hardhearted the precious love particularly as
curiosity happens to be one of her own special little virtues Take a
kiss Danesbury and now as you love me youll be merciful The girl
flitted away and Miss Danesbury turned to Hester whose face had changed
from red to pale during this little scene
What a horrid vulgar lowbred girl she exclaimed with passion for
in all the experiences of her short life Hester had never even imagined
that personal remarks could be made of any one in their very presence I
hope shell get a lot of punishmentI hope you are not going to forgive
her she continued for her anger had for the time quite overcome her
shyness
Oh my dear my dear we should all be forgiving exclaimed Miss
Danesbury in her gentle voice Welcome to Lavender House love I am
sorry I was not in the hall to receive you Had I been this little
rencontre would not have occurred Annie Forest meant no harm
howevershes a wild little sprite but affectionate You and she will
be the best friends possible byandby Now let me take you to your
room the gong for tea will sound in exactly five minutes and I am sure
you will be glad of something to eat
Miss Danesbury then led Hester across the hall and up some broad low
thicklycarpeted stairs When they had ascended two flights and were
standing on a handsome landing she paused
Do you see this baize door dear she said This is the entrance to
the school part of the house This part that we are now in belongs
exclusively to Mrs Willis and the girls are never allowed to come here
without leave All the school life is lived at the other side of this
baize door and a very happy life I assure you it is for those little
girls who make up their minds to be brave and good Now kiss me my dear
and let me bid you welcome once again to Lavender House
Are you our principal teacher then asked Hester
I oh dear no my love I teach the younger children English and I
look after the interests and comforts of all I am a very useful sort of
person I believe and I have a motherly heart dear and it is a way
with little girls to come to me when they are in trouble Now my love
we must not chatter any longer Take my hand and let us get to your room
as fast as possible
Miss Danesbury pushed open the baize door and instantly Hester found
herself in a different region Mrs Willis part of the house gave the
impression of warmth luxuriance and even elegance of arrangement At
the other side of the door were long narrow corridors with snowwhite
but carpetless floors and rather cold distempered walls Miss
Danesbury holding the new pupils hand led her down two corridors and
past a great number of shut doors behind which Hester could hear
suppressed laughter and eager chattering voices At last however they
stopped at a door which had the number 32 written over it
This is your bedroom dear said the English teacher and tonight you
will not be sorry to have it alone Mrs Willis received a telegram from
Susan Drummond your roommate this afternoon and she will not arrive
until tomorrow
However bare and even cold the corridors looked the bedroom into which
Hester was ushered by no means corresponded with this appearance It was
a small but daintilyfurnished little room The floor was carpeted with
green felt the one window was hung with pretty draperies and two little
narrow white beds were arranged gracefully with French canopies All the
furniture in the room was of a minute description but good of its kind
Beside each bed stood a mahogany chest of drawers At two corresponding
corners were marble wash handstands and even two pretty toilet tables
stood side by side in the recess of the window But the sight that
perhaps pleased Hester most was a small bright fire which burned in the
grate
Now dear this is your room As you have arrived first you can choose
your own bed and your own chest of drawers Ah that is right Ellen has
unfastened your portmanteau she will unpack your trunk tonight and
take it to the boxroom Now dear smooth your hair and wash your hands
The gong will sound instantly I will come for you when it does
CHAPTER IV
LITTLE DRAWINGROOMS AND LITTLE TIFFS
Miss Danesbury true to her word came to fetch Hester down to tea They
went down some broad carpetless stairs along a wide stone hall and
then paused for an instant at a halfopen door from which a stream of
eager voices issued
I will introduce you to your schoolfellows and I hope your future
friends said Miss Danesbury After tea you will come with me to see
Mrs Willisshe is never in the schoolroom at teatime Mdlle Perier
or Miss Good usually superintends Now my dear come alongwhy surely
you are not frightened
Oh please may I sit near you asked Hester
No my love I take care of the little ones and they are at a table by
themselves Now come in at oncethe moment you dread will soon be over
and it is nothing my lovereally nothing
Nothing never as long as Hester lived did she forget the supreme agony
of terror and shyness which came over her as she entered that long low
brightlylighted room The forty pairs of curious eyes which were raised
inquisitively to her face became as torturing as forty burning suns She
felt an almost uncontrollable desire to run away and hideshe wondered
if she could possibly keep from screaming aloud In the end she found
herself she scarcely knew how seated beside a gentle sweetmannered
girl and munching bread and butter which tasted drier than sawdust and
occasionally trying to sip something very hot and scalding which she
vaguely understood went by the name of tea The buzzing voices all
chattering eagerly in French and the occasional sharp highpitched
reprimands coming in peremptory tones from the thin lips of Mdlle
Perier sounded far off and distanther head was dizzy her eyes
swamthe tired and shy child endured tortures
In afterdays in long afteryears when the memory of Lavender House was
to come back to Hetty Thornton as one of the sweetest brightest episodes
in her existencein the days when she was to know almost every blade of
grass in the gardens and to be familiar with each corner of the old
house with each face which now appeared so strange she might wonder at
her feelings tonight but never even then could she forget them
She sat at the table in a dream trying to eat the tasteless bread and
butter Suddenly and swiftly the thick and somewhat stale piece of bread
on her plate was exchanged for a thin fresh and delicatelycut slice
Eat that whispered a voiceI know the other is horrid Its a shame
of Perier to give such stuff to a stranger
Mdlle Cecile you are transgressing you are talking English came in
a torrent of rapid French from the head of the table You lose a conduct
mark maamselle
The young girl who sat next Hester inclined her head gently and
submissively and Hester venturing to glance at her saw that a delicate
pink had spread itself over her pale face She was a plain girl but even
Hester in this first moment of terror could scarcely have been afraid
of her so benign was her expression so sweet the glance from her soft
full brown eyes Hester now further observed that the thin bread and
butter had been removed from Cecils own plate She began to wonder why
this girl was indulged with better food than the rest of her comrades
Hester was beginning to feel a little less shy and was taking one or two
furtive glances at her companions when she suddenly felt herself turning
crimson and all her agony of shyness and dislike to her schoollife
returning She encountered the full bright quizzical gaze of the girl
who had made personal remarks about her in the porters room The merry
black eyes of this gypsy maiden fairly twinkled with suppressed fun when
they met hers and the bright head even nodded audaciously across the
table to her
Not for worlds would Hester return this friendly greetingshe still held
to her opinion that Miss Forest was one of the most illbred people she
had ever met and in addition to feeling a considerable amount of fear
of her she quite made up her mind that she would never be on friendly
terms with so underbred a girl
At this moment grace was repeated in sonorous tones by a sternlooking
person who sat at the foot of the long table and whom Hester had not
before noticed Instantly the girls rose from their seats and began to
file in orderly procession out of the tearoom Hester looked round in
