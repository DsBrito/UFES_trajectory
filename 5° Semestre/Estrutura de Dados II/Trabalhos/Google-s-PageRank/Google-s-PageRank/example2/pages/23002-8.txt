the Hall by inserting the word smoking had been debated and had
prevailed A proposition to buy a new mangle for the laundry had been
defeated it having been humorously suggested that the women could
mangle each other Other matters of interest had been considered
Finally as the hour for adjournment drew near a proposition was
brought forth appropriate to the season Saint Patricks Day was
approaching It was to many a day of temptation particularly in the
evening Would it not be a good plan to hold out the helping hand
in the form of a Saint Patricks Day festival with an address for
example upon Saint Patricks life with Irish songs and Irish readings
Such an entertainment would draw it would keep a good many people out
of the saloons Such was the suggestion
The proposition excited no little interest Ladies who had begun to put
on their wraps sat down again To one of the board a clergyman who had
lately been lecturing on Popery the Peoples Peril the proposition
was startling It looked toward the breaking down of all barriers it
gave Romanism an outright recognition Another member a produceman
understoodin fact he had read in his denominational weeklythat
Saint Patrick could be demonstrated to have been a Protestant and
he suggested that that fact might be brought out Others viewed
the matter in that humorous light in which this festival day commonly
strikes the American mind
The motion prevailed Even the antipapistic clergyman was comforted
apparently at last for he was heard to whisper jocosely to his
lefthand neighbor Saint Patricks Day in the Morning
A committee with the produceman at the head was appointed to select a
speaker and to provide music and reading It was suggested that perhaps
Mr Wakeby and Mrs WilsonSmith would volunteer if urgedtheir
previous charities in this direction had made them famous in the
neighborhood Mr Wakeby to read from Handy Andy Mrs WilsonSmith to
sing Kathleen Mavourneenthere would not be standingroom
So finally unanimity prevailed and with unanimity enthusiasm
The committee met and the details were settled The chairman quietly
reserved to himself by implication the choice of a speaker He knew
that it would be an audience hard to hold The occasion demanded a man
of peculiar gifts Such a man he said to himself he knew
II
The single meetinghouse of L stands on the main street with its
tall spire and its two tiers of grayblinded windows Beside it is the
mossy burialground where prim old ladies walk on Sunday afternoons
with sprigs of sweetwilliam
Across the street and a little way down the road is the square white
house with a hopperroof which an elderly childless widow departing
this life some forty years ago thoughtfully left behind her for a
parsonage It is a pleasant homelike house open to sun and air and
the pleasantest of all its rooms is the ministers study It is an upper
front chamber with windows to the east and the south There is nothing
in the room of any value but whether the minister is within or is
away and is represented only by his palmleaf dressinggown somehow the
spirit of peace seems always to abide there
There is the ancient desk which the ministers children when they
were little used to call the omnibus by reason of a certain vast and
capacious drawer the resort of all homeless thingsnails wafers the
bedkey curtainfixtures carpettacks and dried rhubarb Perhaps it
was to this drawer that the ministers daughter lately referred
when she said that the true motto was One place for everything and
everything in that one place
Over the chimneypiece hangs a great missionary map showing the
stations of the different societies with a key at one side This blue
square in Persia denotes a missionary post of the American Board of
Commissioners that red cross in India is an outpost of a Presbyterian
missionary society this green diamond in Arrapatam marks a station of
the Free Church Missionary Union As one looks the map over he seems to
behold the whole missionary force at work He sees in imagination Mr
Elmer Small from Augusta Maine preaching predestination to a
company of Karens in a house of reeds and the Rev Geo T Wood from
Massachusetts teaching Paley in Roberts College at Constantinople
Thus the whole Christian world lies open before you
Pinned up on one of the doors is the Pauline Chart Have you never seen
the Pauline Chart It was prepared in colored inks by Mr Parker a
theological student with a turn for penmanship and lithographed
and was sold by him to eke out the avails of what are inaptly termed
supplies You would find it exceedingly convenient It shows in a
tabulated form for ready reference the incidents of Saint Pauls
career arranged chronologically Thus you can find at a glance the
visit to Berea the stoning at Lystra or the tumult at Ephesus Its
usefulness is obvious Over the desk is a map of the Holy Land with
mountain elevations
The walls of the room are for the most part hidden by books The shelves
are simple affairs of stained maple covered heavily with successive
coats of varnish cracked as is that of the desk by age and heat The
contents are varied Of religious works there are the Septuagint in two
fat little blue volumes like Roman candles Conants Genesis Hodge
on Romans Hackett on Acts which the ministers small children used
to spell out as Jacket on Acts Knott on the Fallacies of the
Antinomians A Tour in Syria Dr Grant and the Mountain Nestorians and
six Hebrew Lexicons singed by firea paternal inheritance
There are a good many works too of general literature but rather
oddly selected as will happen where one makes up his library chiefly by
writing booknotices Peter Baynes Essays Coleridge the first
volume of Massons Life of Milton Vanity Fair the Dutch Republic the
Plurality of Worlds and Mommsens Rome That very attractive book in
red you need not take down it is only the history of Norwalk Conn
with the residence of J T Wales Esq for a frontispiece the cover
is all there is to it Finally there are two shelves of Patent Office
Reports and Perrys Expedition to Japan with a panoramic view of Yeddo
This shows that the minister has numbered a congressman among his flock
It is here that Dr Parsons is diligently engaged this cold March
afternoon to the music of his crackling airtight stove He is deeply
absorbed in his task and we may peep in and not disturb him He has a
large number of books spread out before him but looking them over we
miss Langes Commentaries Bengels Gnomon Cobb on Galatiansthose
safe and sound authorities always provided with the correct view
The books which lie before the Doctor seem all to deal with a Romish
Saint and of all the saints in the world Saint Patrick In full sight
of his own steeple from which the bell is even now counting out
the sixtynine years of a good brother just passed away in hope of a
Protestant heaventolling out the years for the village housewives
who pause and count under such hallowing influencesbeneath as it
were the very shadow of the Missionary Map and the Pauline Chart and
with a gray Jordan rushing down through a scarlet Palestine directly
before him suggestive of all good things with Knott on the Fallacies
at his right hand and with Dowling on Romanism on his left the Doctor
is actually absorbed in Papistical literature Here are the works of Dr
Lanigan and Father Colgan and Monseigneur Moran Here is the Life and
Legends of Saint Patrick illustrated with a portrait in gilt of
Brian Boru on the cover Here are the Tripartite Life in Latin and the
saints Confession and the Epistle to Coroticus the Ossianic Poems
and Miss Cusacks magnificent quarto which the Doctor has borrowed from
the friendly priest at the factory village four miles away who borrowed
it from the library of the Bishop to lend to him
Perhaps you have never undertaken to prepare a life of Saint Patrick
If so you have no idea of the difficulties of the task In the first
place you must settle the question whether Saint Patrick ever existed
And this is a disputed point for while there are those like Father
Colgan whose clear faith accepts Saint Patrick just as he stands in
history and tradition yet on the other hand there are sceptics like
Ledwick who contend that the saint is nothing but a prehistoric myth
floating about in the imagination of the Irish people
Having settled to your satisfaction that Patrick really lived you
must next proceed to fix the date of his birth and here you enter upon
complicated calculations You will probably decide to settle first as a
startingpoint the date of the saints escape from captivity and to
do this you will have to reconcile the fact that after the captivity he
paid a friendly visit to his kinsman Saint Martin of Tours who died in
397 with the fact that he was not captured until 400
Next you will come to the matter of the saints birthplace and this is
a delicate question for you will have to decide between the claims of
Ireland of Scotland and of France and you will very probably find
yourself finally driven to the conclusionfor the evidence points that
waythat Saint Patrick was a Frenchman
Next comes the question of the saints length of days and if you
attempt to include only the incidents of his life of which there can be
no possible doubt you will stretch his age on until you will probably
fix it at one hundred and twenty years
But when you have settled the existence the date of birth and the
nationality of Saint Patrick you are still only upon the threshold
of your inquiries for you next find before you for examination a vast
variety of miracles accredited to him which you must examine weeding
out such as are puerile and are manifestly not well established and
retaining such as are proved to your satisfaction You will be struck
at once with the novel and interesting character of some of them Prince
Caradoc was changed into a wolf An Irish magician who opposed the saint
was swallowed by the earth as far as his ears and then on repentance
was instantly cast forth and set free An Irish pagan dead and long
buried talked freely with the saint from out his turfcovered grave
and charitably explained where a certain cross belonged which had been
set by mistake over him The saint was captured once and was exchanged
for a kettle which thenceforth froze water over the fire instead of
boiling it until the saint was sent back and the kettle returned
Ruain son of Cucnamha Amhalgaidhs charioteer was blind He went in
haste to meet Saint Patrick to be healed Mignag laughed at him My
troth said Patrick it would be fit that you were the blind one The
blind man was healed and the seeing one was made blind RoiRuain is the
name of the place where this was done Patricks charioteer was looking
for his horses in the dark and could not find them Patrick lifted up
his hand his five fingers illuminated the place like five torches and
the horses were found
You see that one has a good deal to go through who undertakes to prepare
a life of Saint Patrick
But our thoughts have wandered from Dr Parsons He has gathered the
books before him with great pains from public and private libraries
and he religiously meant to make an exhaustive study of them all but
sermons and parish calls and funerals and that little affair of
Mrs Samuel Nute have forced him by a process of which we all know
something to forego his projected subsoil ploughing and make such hasty
preparation as he can
He has read the Confession and the Epistle to Coroticus and he has
glanced over the Life and Legends reading in a cursory way of the
lepers miraculous voyage of the fantastic snow of the tombstone that
sailed the seas of the two trout that Patrick left to live forever in a
well
The two inseparable trout
Which would advance against perpetual streams
Without obligation without transgression
Angels will be along with them in it
And being very fond of pure water himself the Doctor is touched by
Patricks lament when far away from the well Uarangar
Uarangar Uarangar
O well which I have loved which loved me
Alas my cry O my dear God
That my drink is not from the pure well of Uarangar
But finally he has settled down as most casual students will to the
sincere and charming little sketch by William Bullen MorrisSaint
Patrick the Apostle of Ireland He is reading it now by the east
window holding the book at armslength as is his wont
The theme is new to him There opens up a fresh and interesting field
The dedication of the little book strikes his imagination To the
Members of the Confraternity of Saint Patrick established at the London
Oratory who with the children of the saint in many lands are the
enduring witnesses of the faith which seeth Him who is invisible
He is interested in the motto on the titlepageEn un mot on y voit
beaucoup le caractere de S Paul and in the authorizationNihil

Card
The Doctor looks through the book in order First the introduction and
here he considers the questionsFirst was there in fact such a man
as Saint Patrick Second what was his nationality Third when was he
born and herein does the date of his escape from captivity conflict
with the date of his visit to his kinsman Saint Martin of Tours
Fourth to what age did he live Fifth where and by whom was he
converted Sixth are his miracles authentic and so forth
After this introductory study the book takes up the saints life in
connected order Patrick was the son of a Roman decurio From his
earliest days wonders attended him When he was an infant and was
about to be baptized it happened that no water was to be had for the
sacrament whereupon at the sign of the cross made by the priest
with the infants hand upon the earth a fountain gushed forth from the
ground and the priest who was blind anointing his own eyes with the
water received his sight
As Patrick grew older wonders multiplied He came as an apostle of the
faith to Strangford Lough Dichu the prince of that province forewarned
by the Druids raised his sword at Patrick but instantly his hand was
fixed in the air as if carved of stone then light came to Dichus
soul and from a foe he became a loving disciple
Then comes the story of the fast upon the mountain It was on the height
ever since called Cruachan Patrick which looks to the north upon
Clew Bay and to the west on the waters of the Atlantic It was Shrove
Saturday a year and a little more from the apostles first landing
in Ireland Already he had carried the gospel from the eastern to the
western sea But his spirit longed for the souls of the whole Irish
nation Upon the mountain he knelt in prayer and as he prayed his
faith and his demands assumed gigantic proportions An angel came down
and addressed him God could not grant his requests the message ran
they were too great Is that his decision asked Patrick It is
said the angel It may be his said Patrick it is not mine for my
decision is not to leave this cruachan until my demands are granted
The angel departed For forty days and forty nights Patrick fasted and
prayed amid sore temptations The blessing must fall upon all his poor
people of Erin As he prayed he wept and his cowl was drenched with
his tears
At last the angel returned and proposed a compromise The vast Atlantic
lay before them Patrick might have as many souls as would cover its
expanse as far as his eyes could reach But he was not satisfied with
that his eyes he said could not reach very far over those heaving
waters he must have in addition a multitude vast enough to cover the
land that lay between him and the sea The angel yielded and now bade
him leave the mountain But Patrick would not I have been tormented
he said and I must be gratified and unless my prayers are granted
I will not leave this cruachan while I live and after my death there
shall be here a caretaker for me
The angel departed Patrick went to his offering
At evening the angel returned How am I answered asked Patrick
Thus said the angel all creatures visible and invisible including
the Twelve Apostles have entreated for theeand they have obtained
Strike thy bell and fall upon thy knees for the blessing shall be on
all Erin both living and dead A blessing on the bountiful King that
hath given said Patrick now will I leave the cruachan
It was on Holy Thursday that he came down from the mountain and returned
to his people
III
One afternoon at about this time you might have seen Mr Cole
the missionary of the DayStara small lithe man with a red
beardmaking his way up town He walked rapidly as he always did for
he was a busy man
He was an exceedingly busy man During the past year as was shown by
his printed report he had made 2014 calls or five and onehalf
calls a day he had read the Scriptures in families 792 times he had
distributed 931456 pages of religious literature he had conversed on
religious topics with 3918 persons or ten and seventenths persons per
day Sabbaths included It was perhaps because he was so busy that there
was complaint sometimes that he mixed matters and took things upon his
shoulders which belonged to others
Mr Coles rapid pace soon brought him to a broad and pleasant
crossstreet he went up the high steps of one of the houses rang the
bell and was admitted
Rev Mr Martin was in his study and the missionary was shown up
Precisely what the conversation was has not been reported but certain
it is that the next day after Mr Coles call Mr Martin began to
prepare himself for an address upon the life of Saint Patrick It was an
entirely new topic to him but he soon found himself in the full current
of the stream consideringFirst did such a man really exist or is
Saint Patrick a mere myth floating in the imagination of the Irish
people Second what was his nationality Third where was he born and
herein how are we to reconcile his escape from captivity in 493 with
his visit to his kinsman Saint Martin of Tours after his escape from
captivity in 490 Fourth to what age did he live Fifthand so
forth
Mr Martin had begun his labors by taking down his encyclopaedia and
such books of reference as he had thought could help him and had
succeeded so far as to get an outline of the saints life and to
find mention of several works which treated of this topic There were
Montalemberts Monks of the West and Dr ODonovans Annals of the
Four Masters the works of Monseigneur Moran and Father Colgan the
Tripartite Life and a certain magnificent quarto by Miss Cusack All
these and many more he had hoped to find in the different libraries of
the city But great had been his surprise on visiting the libraries
to find that the books he wanted were invariably out It was a little
startling at first to come upon this footprint in the sand but a
little reflection set the feeling at rest The subject was an odd one
to him to be sure but there were thousands of people in the city who
might very naturally be concerned in it particularly at this time when
Saint Patricks Day was approaching None the less the fact remained
that the books he wantedscattered through two or three librarieswere
always out
As he stepped out from the Free Library into the street it occurred
to him to go to a Catholic bookstore near at hand to look for what he
wanted
It was a large showy shop with Virgins and crucifixes and altar
candelabras in the windows and pictures of bleeding hearts He went in
and stood at the counter A rosyfaced servantgirl with a shy pleased
expression was making choice of a rosary A young priest a few steps
away was looking at an image of Saint Joseph
The salesman left the servantgirl to her hesitating choice and turned
to Mr Martin
What have you asked Mr Martin with a slightly conscious tone upon
the life of Saint Patrick
The priest turned and looked but the salesman with an unmoved
countenance went to the shelves and selected two volumes and laid
them in silence on the counter One was the Life and Legends of Saint
Patrick with a picture in gilt of Brian Boru on the cover The other
was Saint Patrick the Apostle of Ireland by William Bullen Morris
Priest of the Oratory They were both greencovered
Early in the evening Mr Martin settled down by his study fire to his
new purchases First he took up the Life and Legends He read the
saints own Confession and the Letter to Coroticus and looked through
the translation of the Tripartite Life with its queer mixture of Latin
and English Prima feria venit Patricius ad Talleriam where the regal
assembly was to Cairpre the son of Niall Interrogat autem Patricius
qua causa venit Conall and Conall related the reason to Patrick
He glanced over the miracles and wonders of which this book was full
But before very long he laid it aside and took up the Life by William
Bullen Morris Priest of the Oratory and decided that he must depend
upon that for his preparation
It was late at night It was full time to stop reading but it laid
strong hold of his imaginationthis strange intense and humorous
figure looming up all new to him from the mists of the past He read
the book to the end he read how the good Saint Bridget foretold the
apostles death how two provinces contended for his remains and how a
light shone over his burialplace after he was laid to rest
It was very late when Mr Martin finished the book and laid it down
Thus it happens that the Rev Dr Parsons and the Rev Mr Martin are
both preparing themselves at the same time on the life of Saint Patrick
from this one brief book by William Bullen Morris Priest of the
Oratory
IV
Saint Patricks Day has come and is now fast waning The sun has sunk
behind the chimneystack of the New Albion dancehall the street lamps
are lighted and are faintly contending against the dull glow of the late
afternoon
There is a lull between day and evening All day there has been a stir
in the city There has been a procession in green sashes with harps on
the bannersa long procession in barouches on horseback and afoot
There have been impassioned addresses before the Hibernian Society and
the Saint Peters Young Mens Irish Catholic Benevolent Association
There has been more or less celebration in Ship Street
The evening advances It is seven oclock Strains of invitation issue
from all the dancehalls Already the people have begun to file in to
the DayStar Mission The audienceroom is on the street floor The
missionary stands at the open door with anxious smiles urging decorum
A knot of idlers on each side of the doorway on the sidewalk comment
freely on him and on those who enter Every moment or two a policeman
forces them back
At a quarter of seven a preliminary praisemeeting begins Singing from
within jars against the fiddling from over the way You hear at once
Come to Jesus just now and Old Dan Tucker
Already the seats are filledeight in a settee those who come
now will have to stand Still people continue to file in laborers
Portuguese sewingwomen two or three firemen in longtailed coats
and silver buttons from Hook and Ladder Six in the next block
grosslooking women habitues of the Mission with children women
who are habitues of no mission prosperous saloonkeepers one of the
councilmen of the wardhe is a saloonkeeper too
Dr Parsonss train brought him to town in good season He passed in
with other invited guests at the private door and he has been upon the
platform for ten minutes His daughter is beside him ten or a dozen of
his parishioners who have come too occupy seats directly in front
The platform seats are nearly all taken it is time to begin The
streetdoor opens and a passage is made for a newcomer It is Mr
Martin A contingent from his church come with him and fill the few
chairs that are still reserved about the desk
Now all would appear to be ready but there is still a few moments
pause The missionary is probably completing some preliminary
arrangements The audience sit in stolid expectation
Dr Parsons from beneath his eyebrows is studying the faces before
him In this short time his address has entirely changed form in his
mind It was simple as he had planned it it must be simpler yet But he
has felt the pulse of the people before him He feels that he can hold
them that he can stir them
Meanwhile a whispered colloquy is going on at the rear of the platform
between the missionary and the chairman of the committee for the
evening The missionary appears to be explanatory and apologetic
the chairman flushed In a moment a hand is placed on Dr Parsonss
shoulder He starts half rises and turns abruptly
There has been it seems an unfortunate misunderstanding Through some
mistake Mr Martin has been asked to make the address upon the life
of Saint Patrick and has prepared himself with care He is one of
the Missions most influential friends his church is among its chief
benefactors It is an exceedingly painful affair but will Dr Parsons
give way to Mr Martin
So it is all over The Doctor takes his seat and looks out again upon
those hard dreary faceshis no longer He has not realized until
now how he has been looking forward to this evening But the vision has
fled No ripples of uncouth laughter no ready tears No reaching these
dull violated hearts through the Saint whom they adore that privilege
is anothers
But the chairman again draws near Will Dr Parsons make the opening
prayer
The Doctor bows assent He folds his arms and closes his eyes You can
see that he is trying to concentrate his thoughts in preparation for
prayer It is doubtless hard to divert them from the swift channel in
which they have been bounding along
Now all is ready The missionary touches a bell the signal for silence
The Doctor rises For a moment he stands looking over the rows on rows
of hardened faceslooking on those whom he has so longed to reach He
raises his hand there is a dead silence and he begins
It was inevitable at the outset that he should refer to the occasion
which had brought us together It was natural to recall that we were
come to celebrate the birth of an uncommon man It was natural to
suggest that he was no creature of story or ancient legend floating
about in the imagination of an ignorant people but a real man like
us of flesh and blood It was natural to add that he was a man born
centuries ago that the scene of his labors was the green island across
the sea where many of us now present had first seen the light It was
natural to give thanks for that godly life which had led three nations
to claim the good mans birthplace It was natural to suggest that
if about the sweet memories of this mans life fancy had fondly woven
countless legends we might with a discerning eye read in them all
the saintly power of the man of God What though his infant hand may
not have caused earthly waters to gush from the ground and heal the
blindness of the ministering priest nevertheless doth childhood ever
call forth a wellspring of life giving fresh sight to the blindto
teacher and taught
But why go on Who has not heard again and again the oldfashioned
prayer wherein all is laid forth in outline but with distinctness We
give thanks for this May this be impressed upon our hearts May this
lead us solemnly to reflect
The heart that is full must overflowif not in one way then in
another
Mr Martin has not been told about Dr Parsons He sits and listens as
the Doctor goes on in the innocence of his heart pouring forth with
warmth and fervor the life of the saint according to William Bullen
Morris Priest of the Oratorypouring forth in unmistakable detail Mr
Martins projected discourse
The prayer is ended a hymn is sung and then the missionary presents
to the audience the Rev Mr Martin whom they are always delighted to
hear he will now address them upon the life of Saint Patrick
Mr Martin rises He takes a sip of water He coughs slightly He passes
his handkerchief across his lips So far all is well But the prayer is
in his mind Moreover he unfortunately catches his wifes eye with a
suggestion of suppressed merriment in it
What does he say What can he say There are certain vague lessons from
the saints virtues some applications of what the Doctor has set forth
that is all Saint Patrick was sober we should be sober Saint Patrick
was kind we should be kind
Even his own parishioners admitted that he had not been happy on this
particular occasion
But at the close of the meeting Dr Parsons received a compliment As
he descended from the platform Mr John Keenan who kept the
bestappointed barroom on the street advanced to meet him Mr Keenan
was in an exceedingly happy frame of mind He grasped the Doctors hand
I wish sir he said with a fine brogue to congratulate you upon
your very eloquent prayer It remind me sirand I take pleasure to
say itit remind me sir of the Honorable John Kellys noble oration
on Daniel OConnell
Late that evening the Doctor stood at his studywindow looking out for
a moment before retiring to rest There was no light in the room and
the maps and the charts and the tall bookshelves were only outlines
There was a glimmer from a farmhouse two miles away where they were
watching with the dead
The Doctors daughter came in with a light in her hand to bid her father
goodnight
What did you think Pauline he said to her of Mr Martins talk
It had not been mentioned till now
Pauline hardly knew what to think She knew that it was not what the
Rev Dr Parsons would have given them But honestly what did her
father think of it
The Doctor mused for a moment then he gave his judgment I think he
said that it showed a certain lack of preparation
