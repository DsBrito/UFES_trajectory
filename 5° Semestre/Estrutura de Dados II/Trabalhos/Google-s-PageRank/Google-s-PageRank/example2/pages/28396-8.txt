INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
In accordance with classic precedent this anthology ought to have
consisted of 1001 Gems of German Thought I have been content with
half that number notheaven knowsfor any lack of material but
simply for lack of time and energy to make the ingathering After all
enough is as good as a feast and I think that the evidence as to the
dominant characteristics of German mentality is tolerably complete as
it stands
Though I hope it is fairly representative the collection does not
pretend to be systematic I have cast no sweeping dragnet but have
simply dipped almost at random into the wide ocean of German thought
Some of my most precious finds I have come upon by pure chance and
by pure chance too I have no doubt missed many others Some books
that I should have liked to examine have not been accessible to me
and there must be many of which I have never heard On the other hand
the list of books from which my gems have been selected by no means
indicates the extent of my readingor skimming I have gone through
many books and pamphlets which furnished no quotable extracts but
none that diverged in tone from the rest or marred the majestic
unison of German selflaudation and contempt for the rest of the
world I have read of but not seen a book by one FW Forster which
is said to contain a protest against theoretic warworship and even a
mild defence of England How very mild it is we may judge from this
sentence England has given us not only men like Lord Grey
scoundrels and hypocrites who have this war upon their conscience it
has also given us the Salvation Army etc etc
One voice the reader may be surprised to miss from the great
chorusthe voice of William the Second He is unrepresentedsave in
one passing remark No 136for two reasons In the first place
his most striking utterancethe injunction to his soldiers to emulate
the Huns of Attilathough almost certainly genuine is not official
and could not be quoted without discussion1 In the second place to
confess the truth I shrank from the intolerable monotony of reading
his Majestys speechesthat endless array of platitudes in full
uniformon the chance of discovering one or two quotable gems
Practically all my quotations are taken from books and pamphlets The
sole exceptions are a few extracts from prewar newspapers cited in
Nippolds Der deutsche Chauvinismus It would have been an endless
and unprofitable task to garner up the extravagances of German
newspapers since the outbreak of the war not to mention that a German
anthologist could probably make a pretty effective retort by going
through the files of the British war press
Is my anthology as it stands open to a telling tu quoque by means of
a selection of gems from British books and pamphlets of the type of
those from which I have made my gleanings Is it a case of the mote
and the beam I think we may be pretty confident that it is not I
doubt whether the literature of the world can show a parallel to the
amazing outburst of tribal arrogance unrestrained and unashamed of
which these pages contain but a few scattered specimens In the
extracts from literature Before the War which have always been kept
apart from those which date from After July 1914 the reader may
see this habit of mind growing and gathering strength the declaration
of war opens the floodgates and the torrent rushes forth grandiose
overwhelming and I believe unique I know of only one English book
in which the German taste and temper is emulated It is certainly a
deplorable production but it is the work of a wholly unknown man
whereas many of the most incredible utterances in the following pages
proceed from men of worldwide reputation Indeed few contemporary
German names of much distinction are absent from my list
WilamowitzMollendorf Harnack Wundt Oncken Eucken Haeckel
Naumann Rohrbach Sombart Liszt all join with a will in the chorus
of arrogance ambition and hate Many quotations come from a series
of pamphlets called Deutsche Reden in schwerer Zeit to which all
the most eminent professors of Berlin University have contributed
with some from other universities I have also no doubt culled
passages from a good many nobodies and busybodies but when the
nobodies and the somebodies are found to echo and reecho each other
the inference is that the general tone of the public mind is very
fairly represented It will be noted that many of the wildest shrieks
of selfglorification and ferocity proceed from clerics and
theologians
The world as a whole has been curiously blind to the inordinate
selfvaluation characteristic of the German spirit So long ago as the
beginning of last century we find Fichte assuring his countrymen
that There are no two ways about it if you founder the whole of
humanity founders with you without hope of any possible restoration
Even Heine in the preface to Deutschland 1844 could write
halfjestingly that if only the Germans would outsoar the French in
deeds as they already had in thought and if they would carry out in
their spiritual and political life some rather vaguely indicated
reforms not only Alsace and Lorraine but all France all Europe
the whole world would become German I often dream he adds of
this mission this universal dominance of Germany Of course we are
not to write Heine down a PanGerman of the modern realistic type
There is more than a dash of irony in this passagehe obviously
implies that there is very little chance of Germany fulfilling the
conditions that he lays down as indispensable to her worlddomination
Nevertheless there is a sinister significance in the fact that a
spirit like his should be found dallying for a moment with dreams of
worldsupremacy It was of course the war of 1870 with its
resounding triumphs that brought these visions so to speak within
the range of practical politics For fifteen or twenty years Germany
was as Bismarck said sated but with the coming of the youthful
pushful selfassertive Kaiser her aggressive instincts reawakened
and she fell to brooding over the idea that her incomparable physical
and spiritual energies were cabind cribbd confined The rapid
growth of her population reinforced this idea and the increase of her
wealth as was natural only made her greedy for more The result was
that she gave her soul over in fatal earnest to an ambitious and
grasping tribalism to which she was from of old only too prone The
PanGermans were the Uhlans the stormy petrels of the movement but
the whole mind of the nation was in reality carried away by it save
for a very small section which was conscious of its dangers and feebly
protested The egoism of which she was constantly accusing other
nations ran riot in her own breast was elevated into a political
virtue and expressed itself on the spiritual side in a towering
racial vanity The word deutsch always a word of magical
properties became the synonym of an unapproachable superiority in
every walk of life2a superiority that sanctified aggression and
made domination a duty In many minds no doubt these sentiments wore
a decent mask but the moment war broke out the mask dropped off
with the amazing results very imperfectly mirrored in the following
pages
But selfworship and the craving for aggrandizement are in reality
very uninspiring emotions The thing that has most deeply impressed me
in my searching of the German warscriptures is the extraordinary
aridity of spirit that pervades them A literature more unidead to
use Johnsons word more devoid of original thought or grace or
charm or atmosphere it would be hard to conceive There are of
course some inequalities One or two writers seem to the foreign
reader to have a certain dignity of style which is lacking in the
common herd But in the very best there is little that gives one even
literary pleasure and nothing that shows any depth of humanity any
generous feeling any openness of outlook Even a happy phrase is so
rare that when it does occur one treasures it I find for instance
in a little book by Friedrich Meinecke a distinction between
politics of ideas and politics of interests that is happily put and
worth remembering Again Professor v Harnack restates the principle
that hes the best cosmopolite who loves his native country best in
a rather ingenious way There is no such thing as fruit he says
there are only apples pears etc If we want to be good fruit we
must be a good apple or a good pear These are small scintillations
but the toiler through German pamphlet literature is truly grateful
for them
For the rest when you have read three or four of these pamphlets you
have read all The writers seem to be working a sort of Imperial
German treadmill stepping dutifully from plank to plank of patriotic
dogma in a prearranged rotation The topics are few and
everrecurrentdieser uns aufgezwungene Krieg this war which has
been forced upon us the glorious uprising of Germany at its
outbreak the miracle of mobilization the Russian knout French
frivolity the base betrayal of Germany by envious hypocritical
England the immeasurable superiority of German Kultur and Technik
the saintly virtues of the German soldier and so on through the
appointed litany There is even a set of obligatory quotations which
very few have the strength of mind to resist By far the most popular
is Geibels couplet
Und es mag am deutschen Wesen
Einmal noch die Welt genesen
And the world may once more be healed by the German nature or
character It came into vogue before the war The Kaiser struck the
keynote of the whole chorus of selfexaltation when he said August
31 1907 The German people will be the granite block on which the
good God may build and complete His work of Kultur in the world Then
will be fulfilled the word of the poet who said that the world will
one day be healed by the German character In the extracts collected
in Nippolds Der deutsche Chauvinismus a prewar publication the
Geibel couplet appears at least four timesprobably oftener After
the outbreak of the war it is easier to reckon the utterances in
which it does not occur than those in which it does Next in
popularity to the Wesengenesen catchword comes the Kaisers
brilliant saying I no longer know of any partiesI know only German
brothers He is no good German who does not quote this with reverent
admiration Then come four or five others which are about equally in
request Bismarcks We Germans fear God and nothing else in the
world the old furor Teutonicus oderint dum metuant
Arndts
Der Gott der Eisen wachsen liess
Der wollte keine Knechte
The God who made the iron grow meant none to be a bondman and
finally
Und wenn die Welt voll Teufel war
Es soll uns doch gelingen
And though the world were full of devils we should succeed in spite
of them Even a scholar of the distinction of Ulrich v
WilamowitzMollendorf though he avoids the Geibel tag ends one of
his orations by quoting Deutschland uber Alles Imagine Sir Walter
Raleigh or Prof Gilbert Murray winding up an address with a selection
from Rule Britannia
One English quotation occurs as often as any except the ubiquitous
Wesengenesen It is My country right or wrong invariably quoted
in the form Right or wrong my country This is supposed to be the
shockingly immoral watchword of British patriotism It matters nothing
to the German pamphleteer that the maxim is American and that it is
never quoted in Englandnor I believe in the country of its
originexcept in a spirit of irony
And in the face of this deadly uniformity of sentiments phraseology
and quotations Professor Lasson has the audacity to assure us that
The German is personally independent He wants to judge for himself
It is not so easy for him as for others blindly to follow this or that
catchword
We are all I suppose unconscious of our own foibles but I wonder
whether we are all so apt as the Germans to deny them and very likely
attribute them to other people while in the very act of exemplifying
them For example it is firmly fixed in the German mind that the
English consider themselves Gods Chosen People predestined to the
empire of the world I have collected numerous instances of this
allegation Nos 453466 but not a single one which is substantiated
by a quotation from an English writer It is I am convinced
impossible to bring evidence for it unless some expressions to this
effect may be found in the writings of persons who believe that the
English are descended from the lost Ten Tribespersons who are about
as representative of the English nation as those who believe that the
earth is flat The English mind indeed is but little inclined to
this primitive form of theism The German mind on the other hand is
curiously addicted to it and I have brought together a number of
instances Nos 117135 in which German writers make the very claim
to Divine calling and election which they falsely attribute to the
English and denounce as insanely presumptuous3 So too with
egoism The Germans do not actually consider themselves free from
egoism on the contrary they are rather given to boasting of it Nos
212 213 248 300 but while it is a virtue in them it is a very
repulsive vice in the English As for cant which is of course the
commonest charge against the English one can only say that when the
German gives his mind to it he proves himself an accomplished master
of the art Nos 47 55 79 89 94 104 237 423 Here is an
example from a book about Germany by a GermanAustrian4 which
scarcely comes within the scope of my anthology but it is too
characteristic to be lost If you want says the writer in
italics thoroughly to understand the German you must compare the
German sportsman with the hunters of other countries Then a sacred
thrill heiliger Schauer of deep understanding will come over your
heart For the German sportsman takes more pleasure in the life that
surrounds him and which he protects than in the shot which only the
last hot virile craving Mannesgier wrings from him and which he
fires only when he knows that he will kill painlessly kill For
this is the root principle of German sportsmanship God grant me one
day such an end as I strive to bestow upon the game  And if by
mischance the German sportsman wounds without killing a head of game
he suffers with it and does not sleep or rest till he has put it out
of its misery If this be not very nauseous cant where shall we seek
for it
Another curious German characteristic is the idea that however
truculent and menacing a writers expressions may be other people do
him and his country a wicked injustice if they take him at his word A
good instance of this occurs in Ein starkes VolkEin starkes Heer
by Kurd v Strantz published in 1914 shortly before the war This
writer quotes or rather misquotes with enthusiasm from Goethe
Du musst steigen und gewinnen
Du musst siegend triumphieren
Oder deinend unterliegen
Amboss oder Hammer sein5
Next he proceeds to quote from Felix Dahn
Seitdem ists freudig Germanenrecht
Mit dem Hammer Land zu erwerben
Wir sind von des Hammergottes Geschlecht
Und wollen sein Weltreich erben6
Then on the same page only four lines lower down he remarks
plaintivelyForeign and especially French diplomacy is now
industriously spreading the calumny that the German Government and the
German people are given to rattling the sabre and that we want to use
for aggressive ends the increased armament which has been forced upon
us Is it mere hostile prejudice to hold that his own poetical
selections give a certain colour to the calumny
Most of the German attacks on England will be found in the last
analysis to rest on this quaint habit of mindthe habit of assuming
that no matter how hostile and threatening Germanys words and deeds
might be we had no right to do her the injustice of supposing that
she meant anything by them We ought to have known that she was merely
dissembling her love
Some readers may be disposed to regret that the great Germanic
trinity NietzscheTreitschkeBernhardi contribute so largely to my
anthology In the first place it may be said we are tired of their
names in the second place Germans deny that they have had anything
like the influence we attribute to them There is a certain validity
in the first of these objections The constant recurrence of these
three names is certainly a little tedious They are like a
threeheaded Charles Ior a triplicate Geibel I would gladly have
omitted them had it been by any means possible But one might as well
compile an Old Testament anthology and omit Isaiah Jeremiah and
Ezekiel For whatever the Germans may say they are the major
prophets of the newGerman spirit Treitschke is the prophet of
tribalism Nietzsche of ruthlessness Bernhardi of ambition It is
absurd to say that they are not influential Treitschke may have
fallen somewhat out of fashion in the years immediately preceding the
war but his spirit had permeated the political thought of a whole
generation To the living influence of Nietzsche there is a host of
witnesses Gerhart Hauptmann near the beginning of the war averred
that the cultured German soldier carried Zarathustra along with
Faust and the Bible in his knapsack Nor was this an idle guess
Professor Deissmann of Berlin tells us that he enquired into the
matter and learned from booksellers that the books most in demand
among soldiers were the New Testament Faust and Zarathustra
OAH Schmitz in Das wirkliche Deutschland says of the German
youth born in the seventies and early eighties that Nietzsche was
the lighthouse toward which their enthusiasm was directed Prof
Wilhelm Bousset of Gottingen writes There is among us much unripe
unclear Nietzsche enthusiasm many a German ass has thrown the lions
skin of the great man round his shoulders and thinks he has thereby
become a philosopher and prophet Such testimonies could be
multiplied indefinitely There is no question that Nietzsche has been
by far the greatest single force among the spiritual shapers of
newGermany It may be true that he did not intend his immoralism to
be read literally as a guide to conductit may be true that in some
of his most characteristic passages he knew himself to be talking
reckless and dangerous nonsense that was his way of living
dangerouslybut can we reasonably suppose that soldiers in a
conquered country soldiers full of the belief that any opposition
to Germanism was in itself a crime see No 344 paused to look
beneath his surface eulogies of murder and lust for some esoteric
meaning that may possibly underlie them Can it be a mere coincidence
that in the first war which Germany has waged since Nietzsche entered
upon his apostolate of ruthlessness the German armies should have
been animated to all appearance by a literal interpretation of his
beast of prey ideal
As for Bernhardi whom some German writers profess never to have heard
of until we began to talk about him in England one can only say that
he is an exmember of the Great General Staff and is probably a
pretty faithful interpreter of the ideas prevalent in that not
uninfluential organization Moreover his Germany and the Next War
which appeared in the spring of 1912 ran through five editions at 6
marks before that year was out and was then republished in a cheap
and somewhat condensed popular edition under the title of Our
Future Reviewing this edition Die Post says that in its original
form the book was received with the most serious attention in
political and especially in military circles and adds that this
cheaper reprint must now become a book for the people
It is an error however to suppose that a writers importance is to
be measured solely by the influence he can be shown to have exerted A
book or pamphlet may have had little or no active influence and may
yet be a very illuminating symptom of the national frame of mind
Every book must be an effect before it can become a cause That
Treitschke Nietzsche and Bernhardi have been very efficient causes I
see no reason to doubt but at any rate they are immensely significant
effects of the psychological conditions of which I am here gathering
up some random evidences
It was a more difficult question to decide whether the lucubrations of
Herr Houston Stewart Chamberlain came within my scope Yet I had
little hesitation in including him The fact that he is by birth an
Englishman does not make him any the less a characteristic and
recognized mouthpiece of the newGerman spirit It may be objected
that he caricatures it that he is more German than the Germans That
in the first place is impossible in the second place while we have
many evidences that Germans from the Kaiser downward set a high
value on Herr Chamberlains writings we hear little or nothing of any
protest against them as misrepresentations of Deutschtum Shall I be
suspected of a quaint perversity of national prejudice if I say that
Herr Chamberlains war pamphlets are distinctly better reading than
the great majority of their kind They are much more individual much
less stereotyped and monotonous One finds in them an occasional idea
that is not the common property of every man in the street It is
generally not always a more or less crazy idea but one hails it as
an oasis in the desert of blusterous commonplace
The arrangement of my little jewelheap was more difficult if less
laborious than the ingathering Many of my extracts perhaps most
might with equal appropriateness have been ranged under any one of
three or four rubrics Thus my classification is at best rough and to
some extent arbitrary There is however a certain reason in the
sequence of headings The first section Deutschland uber Alles
represents the badge of all the tribethe characteristic which lies
at the root of the whole mischiefGermanys colossal selfglorification
selfadoration If there is anything like it in history it is unknown
to me Other nations may have been as vain but not having the
printingpress so readily at command they gave their vanity less
exuberant expression Besides they may have had a sense of humour The
manifestations of this foible if a thing of such tragic consequences
can be called by such a name fall under certain subheadings It was
clear for instance that the vauntings of German Kultur must have a
compartment to themselveslikewise the assertions of a special
relation to God the claims to the status of a Chosen People and the
comparisons direct and indirect between Germany and Christ Having
established by means of a cloud of witnesses the ruling passion of
the national mind I present in the following section proofs of the
Ambitions in which this megalomania finds its natural utterance In
the sections WarWorship Ruthlessness and Machiavelism are
grouped evidences of the methods of force and fraud by which it was
hoped that these ambitions were to be realized Then in a final
section I have assembled evidences of the inevitable corollary to
morbid selfadorationthe boundless and almost equally unprecedented
contempt and loathing for all adversaries but especially for England
The great majority of my quotations are taken direct from the original
sources the references being exactly given I was scrupulous on this
point not only that the reader might be able to test the accuracy and
fairness7 of my work but because I hoped that some one some day
might be moved to republish the anthology in the original German One
cannot but think that when the warfrenzy is over a brief retrospect
of its extravagances may be salutary for the German spirit In a
certain number of cases however I have not been able to give exact
references because the originals have not been accessible to me This
applies to my selections from three previous volumes of selections
Nippolds Der Deutsche Chauvinismus Andlers Collection de
documents sur le Pangermanisme and Bangs Hurrah and Halleluiah
Andlers excellent and scholarly method has however enabled me to
place quotations from his collection to within a page or two Thus
if some very PanGerman utterance does not occur on the precise page I
have indicated it will certainly be found on the preceding or on the
following page
Italics in my text always represent italics or rather spaced type
in the original but Germans are very lavish in their use of spaced
type and I have not always thought it necessary to reproduce this
peculiarity Points of exclamation unless enclosed in square
brackets are the authors not mine I have almost always resisted
the temptation to employ typographical devices to enhance the lustre
of individual gems In the Index of Authors I have added to many names
a brief note which will enable the reader to estimate the position of
the different writers in the public life of Germany
In bringing together my material I have found valuable help in many
quarters I should like especially to acknowledge my deep obligation
to Mr Alexander Gray for manifold aid and suggestion

FOOTNOTES
1 On the other hand the almost equally remarkable warning to
recruits that they must be ready to shoot down their nearest and
dearest at the AllHighest command is undoubtedly authentic
2 In a pamphlet by Professor A Lasson entitled Deutsche Art und
deutsche Bildung the adjective deutsch occurs 256 times in 42
pagessometimes 13 times in one page often 10 or 11 timesand
always of course with a sort of unctuous implication that human
language contains no higher term of eulogy This enumeration does not
include the constantly recurring deutsch in Deutschland nor the
frequently repeated germanisch and teutonisch
3 It may of course be possible to find many passages in which
English writers say that as a matter of history God or Heaven or
Providence has given the British race great possessions throughout the
worlda fact which the Germans are the first to admit and resent But
this is totally different from claiming a Divine mission to rule or to
civilize or to heal the world
