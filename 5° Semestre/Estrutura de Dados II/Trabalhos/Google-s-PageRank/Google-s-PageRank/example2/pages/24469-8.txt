In the Summer of 1903 two friends of Major Huse were hospitably
entertained by him at his charming home The Rocks on the Hudson
just south of West Point and during their visit were greatly
interested in listening to his recital of some of his experiences as
agent in Europe for purchasing army supplies for the Confederate States
during the Civil war
So impressed were they by this unique bit of history that they
succeeded after much urging in inducing him to write it believing
that it should be preserved and knowing that no one else could furnish
it
His four years experience would if fully told fill a large volume
but this brief recital is all that can be hoped for
If the cost of publication is not met by the nominal price charged for

August 1904
REMINISCENCES
On my return in May 1860 from a six months leave of absence spent in
Europe I found an appointment as professor of chemistry and commandant
of cadets in the University of Alabama awaiting my acceptance During my
absence the President of the University and a committee of the Board of
Trustees visited West Point and the Virginia Military Institute and
pleased with the discipline of both institutions decided to adopt the
military system and applied to Colonel Delafield then the
Superintendent at West Point for an officer to start them Col
Delafield gave them my name but was unable to say whether or not I would
resign from the army I was then a first lieutenant of artillery and
as such was on the rolls of the garrison of Fort Sumter
I accepted the position and began my duties in September My leave of
absence had expired in May but the authorities of the University
fearing that I might regret severing irrevocably my connection with the
armywhich I had entered as a cadet at sixteenobtained from the
Secretary of War an extension of the leave till May 1861 when I was to
resign if all was satisfactory at that time
It is proper to mention here that the introduction of military drill and
discipline at the State University had no connection whatever with any
secession movement in Alabama and the fact that a Massachusettsborn
man and of Puritan descent was selected to inaugurate the system will
or ought to be accepted as confirmatory of this assertion
Discipline was almost at an end at the University and in seeking ways
and means for restoring it the attention of the Faculty and Trustees
was directed to the Virginia Military Institute which had been in
successful operation for about fifty years As this institution had been
organized by a graduate of West Point and in some respects resembled
the United States Military Academy it was hoped that in Alabama good
results might be secured by the adoption of similar methods
Military drill is taught at the present time in many schools and
colleges but the intention of the Alabama University authorities was
not merely to drill students but to hold them under military restraint
as is effectually done at West Point and I may add as cannot be done
in any college designed to qualify young men to become civilian members
of a great republic
West Point and Annapolis have proved themselves noble institutions for
the purpose for which they were designedthat of training young men to
become officers over other menbut the mission of these schools is not
to fit young men for civil life Their methods cannot be grafted upon
literary or technical civil institutions and it is not desirable that
they should be applied to civil colleges or schools of any kind But the
University of Alabama was a military college so far as concerned
discipline and to this end I was given a Colonels commission by the
Governor of the State with two assistants one a major the other a
captain Tents arms and infantry equipments were purchased of the
United States Government and a uniform similar to that of the West
Point cadets was adopted The students were assembled on the first of
September and a camp established on the University grounds Drills were
inaugurated at once and regular camp duties were required and performed
Everything seemed to be progressing very satisfactorily till one day
some three weeks after the pitching of the camp the President of the
University Dr Garland desired to see me at his office On entering I
found him and a trusted professor awaiting my coming with disturbed
looks No time was wasted in the preliminaries Dr Garland came to the
point at once by telling me that there was a mutiny brewing in my camp
which it would be impossible for me to quell He then explained that the
cadets were dissatisfied because I was a northernborn man that they
called me a dd Yankee and intended running me out of the State He
thought they would be successful for the ringleaders were old students
who had given a great deal of trouble before I came and what made the
matter worse these students were sons of influential men in the State
and the mothers of the mutineers were encouraging them
I asked if any of the Trustees or the Faculty wished me to resign and
was assured of the contrary I then said that but for one thing I
should have no hesitation in resigning The cadets backed by their
families had threatened to run me out of the State I should put upon
them the responsibility of executing their threat I should not resign
I went back to camp and never heard anything more about the mutiny
I mention this incident only to show the feeling existing in an extreme
southern State at that timeless than two months before the election of
President Lincoln
The story of the intended mutiny was well founded and was only one
phase of the general feeling of unrest throughout Alabama But even at
that time which was within six weeks of election day the idea of
secession did not prevail Probably had its people been called upon to
vote on the question there would have been a very large majority
against secession After the election in November the unrest manifestly
increased and conservative men began to consider secession possible and
even probable
At the University there was no excitement Instruction went on as usual
and the era of orderly deportment begun in camp continued much to the
satisfaction of every one and especially to the citizens of Tuscaloosa
But military discipline to which as admitted by every one the
improved deportment was due added to the outgo of the University
without materially increasing its income and the only hope of obtaining
money to meet the increased expenses was through an appropriation by the
Legislature To secure this President Garland proposed that the
battalion of Cadetsfor so the students were calledshould go to
Montgomery and be reviewed by the Governor and by the Legislature which
was then in session
This idea was strongly opposed not only by members of the Faculty but by
men whose sons were in the University The fear prevailed that the
students would be unmanageable under the many temptations which
Montgomery would afford and that even the wellmeant hospitality of the
citizens which was sure to be generous would cause trouble Whether to
make the trip or not was left to my decision I decided without
hesitation in favor of the expedition and arrangements were made for
two steamboats one to take us down the Black Warrior the other for the
journey up the Alabama to Montgomery
In Mobile the cadets were cordially received and conducted themselves
to my entire satisfaction On the steamboats their behavior was all that
could be desired and in Montgomery everybody was proud of their
appearance and deportment For sleeping accommodations the cadets
carried their own blankets and turned in on the floor of a large hall
Camp discipline was maintained and perfect order prevailed
The battalion was reviewed in front of the State House by the Governor
and both Houses of the Legislature and everything passed off most
satisfactorily In the evening after the review a committee of the
Legislature called on me and asked what I wanted The reply was An
annual appropriation so long as the military organization was maintained
at the University
I remember that a cousin of Senator John P Hale of New Hampshire one
of the most pronounced abolitionists of the country was a member of
the committee He said to me Now you come up to the House tomorrow and
see how we will put this matter through I did so and certainly it was
put through for while I was there the bill was given all its
readingsthe rules being suspended for the purposeand it was taken to
the Senate and similarly rushed The Governor signed it and the next
day the cadets started on their return home
We had left Tuscaloosa in a heavy rainstorm escorted to the
steamboatsome two milesby the Montgomery Guards The trip had been
entirely successful and there had not been a case of misbehavior from
start to finish Of course drinking was the one thing to be feared and
when one considers all the temptations on the steamboats and in Mobile
and Montgomery it is a little remarkable that there were no infractions
of the rules one of which was that no cadet should enter a barroom on
pain of instant dismissal
As already stated I went to the University of Alabama under leave of
absence which was to terminate in May 1861 In February I received an
order revoking the unexpired portion of my leave and directing me to
report for duty in Washington I replied that my leave was granted with
the understanding that I was to resign at its expiration and as I saw
no reason to alter my determination I offered my resignation There was
no expectation on my part that my future would be any other than such as
my position as professor in the University of Alabama would occasion
My resignation was accepted February 25th In AprilI think it was
April 1stI received a telegram from the Confederate States Secretary
of the Navy Mallory to come to Montgomery and take a commission for
active service I think I am quoting the words of the message I
started without delay and on arriving in Montgomery was introduced to
Secretary of War Walker who soon said to me The President has
designated you to go to Europe for the purchase of arms and military
supplies when can you go I replied that of course I could go
immediately but if any preparations were to be made which would
require time I should like to return to my family before starting
Take ten days said he Be back here at the end of that time I was
then introduced to Col Gorgas Chief of Ordnance to whom I was to
report
I returned to Tuscaloosa and early in the morning of the tenth day of my
leave of absence I drove into Montgomery on the top of a stagecoach
When near the town we met a man on horseback who shouted that Beauregard
had opened fire on Sumter By this I know that it was April 12th There
was naturally much excitement in Montgomery especially about the War
and Navy Departments
On reporting to Col Gorgas I found that no arrangements had been made
for my going to Europe I had no orders and did not know what I was to
do for money I called on the Secretary of the Treasury Meminger but
he knew nothing about my going abroad When are you going said he I
replied that if I expected to get through the North I had no time to
lose and it was finally arranged that he should provide me with money
for my trip to New York where I should receive funds for my journey to
Europe During my interview he remarked that he had no money and it
would appear that the statement was literally true for it is difficult
to conceive from what source so soon after its organization a new
Government could derive any revenue
Before leaving Montgomery Mr Davis called me to his office and asked
me to be seated while he received his callers saying he wanted to talk
with me about my mission and that ideas would come to him between his
interviews with his callers I took the chair assigned me and while he
was reading the pile of letters which lay open before him the callers
began to come in I do not recall any of the conversation which took
place but I remember clearly one incident which some may say was
characteristic of the man Looking over a letter of four fullsized
pages and standing up with some show of irritation he said I wish
people would not write me advice and he tore the letter in two and
repeating the remark tore it into small bits which he threw upon the
floor He mentioned the name of the writer who I knew was a friend
and neighbor
I may be permitted to narrate a personal incident which occurred before
I left Montgomery One evening about sunset while I was waiting in the
office of the Secretary of War for the comparatively insignificant sum
of money to be provided for my expenses to England Mr Davis greeted me
as Major I replied I might ask Mr President in what regiment
having in mind the well known anecdote of the subaltern who on handing
the Emperor Napoleon his chapeau which had fallen was thanked under the
title of captain Mr Davis then explained the principle he had laid
down for himself in appointing officers who had been in the U S army
It was to advance no one more than one grade He said that Beauregard
was only a captain of engineers and had been made a brigadier general
but in this the rule had not been violated for by serving at West
Point as superintendent although for a few days onlyfive as shown by
the recordshe was a colonel in the army and had therefore been
advanced but one grade Mr Davis remarked that there were officers
enough for all field purposes but the trouble was to find men qualified
to prepare the army for its work
I had arranged to pass through Charleston in order that I might visit
Sumter and see the effect of the artillery fire upon it Arriving in
Charleston in the evening I went to Morris Island the following morning
and from there in a rowboat to Sumter accompanied by two young
artillery captains We were all young in those days I was just thirty
and these young men were my juniors by some years They had both been
under my instruction as cadets at West Point when I was on duty there
but I cannot now recall their names On our return from Sumter we three
lay on the warm sand near the shore and naturally the conversation was
chiefly on the events of the last few days In the course of our talk I
remarked What in the world made Anderson surrender the fort For in
my opinion it was no more damaged for defence than a brick wall would
be by a boys snapping marbles against it As for anything the
Confederate artillery could bring to bear upon it it was literally
impregnableas shown by the fact that with all the resources of the
United States army and navy it was never retaken The wooden quarters
had taken fire and for a time doubtless the fort was a very
uncomfortable place and it was feared that the magazine would explode
But when Anderson surrendered all that danger had passed
Major Anderson was a gallant officer who had proved his efficiency and
bravery in the Mexican War for which he was rewarded with two brevets
but for one who saw Sumter as I did shortly after its surrender when
nothing had been changed since Anderson saluted his flag and marched his
command on board the Confederate steamer Isabel it is impossible to
understand why the surrender should have been made when it was
Eventually his command might have been starved out But although for
several days it was short of some kinds of desirable food and destitute
of fresh provisions there remained several barrels of pork which he
took with him when he left Not only was no assault ever made but the
enemy had no boats or scaling ladders with which to attempt an assault
as Anderson must have known
If the United States Government deliberately intended to force a war and
thus settle once for all the entire question between the North and the
South no strategy could have been more effectual than that of
sacrificing Sumter exactly as it was sacrificed The whole affair could
not have been arranged with greater shrewdness and finesse Anderson and
his officerswithout an exception gallant and competentwere made to
appear as heroes and in a sense they were the North was completely
unified and the same can be said of the South The lines were now
distinctly and definitely drawn and every man from Maine to Georgia
must declare for the Government or against it War began such as no man
could have foretold and such as could not cease till one side or the
other should be completely exhausted
From Charleston I went to Baltimore by the Bay Line steamers from
Norfolk arriving on Sunday morningthe day that the men who had been
killed the Friday previous were to be buried The excitement was
intense but the city was quietuncomfortably quiet No one knew what
next to expect I was for my own part concerned only about getting to
New York There were no trains running bridges having been burned and
no one could say when railway traffic would be resumed
There were a few other travelers bound northward who were eager to
continue their journey Two of theseyoung men from
Charlestonapproached me cautiously with a proposal that we three
should hire a carriage to take us to York Pa and we arranged to go
Before we were ready to start an elderly gentleman asked to be
permitted to join the party He was a large handsome man and was
anxious to get to Philadelphia as soon as possible to see a daughter
who lay at the point of death The new comer would be a serious addition
to the weight in our carriage but I had reason to be thankful that we
accommodated him as will appear later
After starting it was determinedwhy I cannot now sayto go to Havre
de Grace instead of York On our arrival in the evening we found the
ferry boat had been taken to convey troops to Annapolis and there was
nothing to be done but wait We all found comfortable lodgings at a
small hotel and in the morning a flat boat took us across to
Perryville
Among the passengers were several men and women who as soon as the boat
landed collected on the piazza of a little country hotel near the
landing and began singing patriotic songs They were apparently
overjoyed at their escape from the southland
At Perryville there was a large wooden shed which served as a railway
station employees were standing about but none could give any
information concerning the trains all of which they said had been
taken by the Government Before noon however a long train came
thundering into the station and immediately men in uniform poured out
of the cars and ran to the waterside where they bathed their faces and
hands They were going to the front The same train was soon ready to
return to Philadelphia and all who desired to go were accommodated
It was impossible to get farther than Philadelphia that day The next
morning on taking my seat in the train I recognized the gentleman
directly behind me as the Hon Caleb Cushing I did not accost him not
caring to meet acquaintances just then and moreover I had no reason
to think that he knew me for although we were born in the same
townNewburyport Masshe was a distinguished public man when I was
a boy
The route from Philadelphia to New York was by the way of Camden to
South Amboy and thence by steamboat The latter was a ferry boat with
room for teams on each side of the engine There were no teams on board
and as I had been sitting for some time and now that we were nearing
New York where I was likely at any moment to meet an acquaintance I was
a little nervous I walked about the lower deck In doing so I met Mr
Cushing face to face He was passing the time in a similar manner I
lifted my cap as I would to any superior officer or public man
Immediately Mr Cushing stopped and said
Good morning Mr Huse you are with the South I understand
For the moment I was staggered but quickly calling to mind that Mr
Cushing had been chairman of the Charleston Democratic Convention which
nominated John C Breckenridge for President I replied
Yes sir what chance do you think the South has
What chance can it have he said the money is all in the North the
manufactories are all in the North the ships are all in the North the
arms and arsenals are all in the North the arsenals of Europe are
within ten days of New York and they will be open to the United States
Government and closed to the South and the Southern ports will be
blockaded What possible chance can the South have There was nothing
for me to say in reply and I probably did the best I could have done
under the circumstances Looking him squarely in the eye I lifted my
cap and said Good morning Mr Cushing I never saw him afterwards
On landing at the Battery I gave my baggage checks to an expressman
taking his receipt and telling him to hold the baggage till called for
As it might be very important not to be recognized I took the
precaution to leave no trail by my baggage which was taken to Liverpool
later by one of the young men who had been my carriage companion from
Baltimore I went at once to the Bank of the Republic where I was to
find letters which would enable me to obtain money for my voyage
I was told to call for Mr S the cashier of the bank On his coming
to the window I asked if he had any letters from Montgomery His face
immediately showed real fear Opening a door near by he said Come
in and I found myself in the bank parlor He immediately locked the
door pulled down the window shades and then asked Now what is it
In the brief time occupied in drawing down the shades etc I
determined what to do and replied
I see Mr S that you are much agitated by my visit and I will not
further compromise you by giving you my name but if you have any
letters from Montgomery which you do not recognize will you be good
enough to send them around to Trenholm Brothers in Pine Street
He assured me he would and I bade him good morning As I was leaving he
said there was intense excitement on the street Andersons command had
just marched up Broadway and aroused the greatest enthusiasm I had
observed a small United States flag near the entrance and Mr S said
he believed if that flag were not at the door the mob would attack the
bank
At the office of Trenholm Brothers I inquired for Mr Wellsman and was
shown into an inner room where I met a large middleaged man bearing a
striking resemblance to the whitehaired gentleman who had been one of
the party from Baltimore to Havre de Grace I introduced myself by
saying that Captain Wellsman was my travelling companion from Baltimore
on Sunday
He is my father said Mr Wellsman I told him of meeting Capt
Wellsman at the Philadelphia station that morning and that he asked me
to say he had found his daughter much better than he expected and they
now had hopes of her recovery I then explained to him that I was an
officer of the Confederate States Army on my way to Europe to purchase
arms and other army supplies that I was to be provided with funds
through Fraser Trenholm  Co Liverpool and expected to get money
from Trenholm Brothers for the expenses of the voyage Mr Wellsman had
no letters for me and had received no information from Montgomery
concerning me Having no money for my voyage the situation was becoming
serious
Excusing himself after a short time Mr Wellsman left the office and
returning within half an hour was even more alarmed than Mr S had
appeared to be He said the excitement was very great and that he
believed if the crowd discovered my business they would hang me to a
lamppost I must not leave the office till I started for the train
What did I propose to do I ought not to think of sailing from New York
I replied that I would go to Canada and take the steamer from Montreal
But I could not sail from anywhere without money
You can have the money said Mr Wellsman How much do you want
Five hundred dollars
And you want it in gold
Yes
He procured the gold ordered some lunch to be brought and about three
oclock I started for the Erie Railway station Sometimes we entertain
angels unawares Captain Wellsman seems to have been a veritable angel
The simple verbal message that I carried to his son served me as a
letter of credit Without it I cannot now see what I could have done
Ten years after the war when I met an old friend he assured me that he
would have had me arrested had he known my mission while I was in New
York
When I left the office of Trenholm Brothers a man on the sidewalk
signaled to another on the opposite side of Pine street and one of
these men sat opposite me on the ferryboat Whether or not they were
shadowing me I never knew I saw nothing more of them after leaving the
boat and had no further adventures till I reached Turners where
trains stop for supper In the restaurant I recognized a number of
friends and my only prudent course was to go without my supper or seek
it elsewhere I chose the latter and got what I could at a bar near by
I had no baggagenot even an overcoatand the night was cold I was in
an ordinary daycoach on my way to Hamilton Canada Through trains were
not so frequent then as now and in Buffalo I had to wait some time
much of which I passed in seeing the town While walking in a retired
part of the city I just escaped meeting an officer of the army whom I
knew by turning down a cross street
At Hamilton I purchased clothing for the voyage and was disappointed to
find that I should have to wait several days for the next steamer from
Montreal I therefore decided to sail from Portland but delayed
purchasing my ticket till I could take the last train that would reach
that city in time to board the steamer This train went only to State
Line on the day it left Hamilton where I stopped over night I remember
the place from the fact that although late in April I was obliged to
break the ice in my pitcher the next morning when I started on what
proved to be my last journey in the United States for several years At
nearly every stopping place on the way to Portland men in uniform and
fully equipped entered the cars We were picking up a regiment under
orders for the front
We finally arrived and my ship was in sight at anchor I confess to a
feeling of relief when I stepped on board from the tug and that feeling
was enhanced when we weighed anchor and the screw began pushing us out
into the neutral territory of the broad Atlantic
There were few passengers and the voyage was without incident save one
of no importance except as tending to confirm the theory of transmission
of thought without language My tableneighbor was a young seacaptain
from Maine who was returning to his vessel which he had left in
Liverpool some weeks before to confer with the owners
One day at dinner without any previous conversation whatever to lead
even indirectly to such a remark he said I believe you are going to
Europe to buy arms for Jeff Davis
I was in the act of taking a piece of potato on my fork and to gain
time before answering I passed the potato to my mouth and then made
about as foolish a reply as was possible saying If he wanted arms he
would be likely to select a man who knew something about arms The
captain immediately remarked Sometimes those fellows that know the
most say the least I could think of nothing to say to advantage and
said nothing the matter was never referred to again
On arriving in London I went to what was then a favorite hotel for
AmericansMorleys in Trafalgar Square The remark of the shipcaptain
interested me and I resolved to probe the matter a little by calling on
a gentleman with whom I had conversed more freely than with any other
passenger He was a lawyer from Portland who in his younger days had
taught school in Mississippi He was stopping at a nearby hotel on the
Strand On meeting him I asked if he knew the object of my visit to
Europe He replied he had not the slightest idea why I was there I then
told him of the captains remark and that his surmise was correct I am
very sure that during the voyage I said nothing from which the nature
of my business could be inferred and as for papers I had received none
since leaving Montgomery
My orders were to purchase 12000 rifles and a battery of field
artillery and to procure one or two guns of larger calibre as models A
short time before the beginning of the war the London Armory Company
had purchased a plant of gunstocking machinery from the Ames
Manufacturing Company of Chicopee Mass Knowing this I went to the
office of the Armory Company the day after my arrival in London with
the intention of securing if possible their entire output
On entering the Superintendents office I found there the American
engineer who superintended the erection of the plant I had known him in
Chicopee Suspecting he might be an agent for the purchase of arms for
the United States Government I asked him bluntly if he was and
added I am buying for the Confederate Government Such a disclosure
of my business may seem to have been indiscreet but at that time I
thought it my best plan and the result proved that I was right He made
no reply to my inquiry but I was satisfied my suspicion was correct and
resolved on the spot to flank his movement if possible
As he had entered the office first it was in order for me to outstay
him which I did On his leaving I asked for a price for all the small
arms the Company could manufacture
The Superintendent said he could not answer me but would refer me to
the Chairman of the CompanyPresident we should call himand would
accompany me to his office There I repeated my inquiry for a price for
all the arms the Company could make for a year with the privilege of
renewing the order The President was not prepared to give me a price
but would do so the next day On calling at his office the following
day he told me that the Company was under contract for all the arms it
could turn out and considering all the circumstances the Directors
felt they ought to give their present customer the preference over all
others
Confirmed in my belief that my competitor was no other than the man whom
I had encountered the day before I was now more determined than ever to
secure the London Armory as a Confederate States arms factory The
Atlantic cable was not then laid and correspondence by mail required
nearly a monthan unreasonable time for a commercial company to hold in
abeyance a desirable opportunity for profit Within a few days I
succeeded in closing a contract under which I was to have all the arms
the Company could manufacture after filling a comparatively small order
for the United States agent This Company during the remainder of the
war turned all its output of arms over to me for the Confederate army
Baring Brothers were at that time the London financial agents for the
United States Government and they would unquestionably have been
supported and gratefully thanked had they assumed the responsibility of
contracting for all the arms in sight in England Any army officer fit
for such a mission as that of buying arms for a great Government at the
outbreak of a war would have acted if necessary without instructions
and secured everything that he could find in the line of essentials
especially arms of which there were very few in the market There were
muskets enough to be had for almost any reasonable offer but of
modern Enfield or Springfield rifleswhich were practically the
samethere were only a few thousand in England and none elsewhere
except in Austria where all were owned by the Government And
according to Mr Cushing these would be available by the United States
but impossible of purchase by the South Yet even so high an authority
as ExAttorney General Cushing proved to be wrong in his assumption as
will be shown below
Any young intelligent West Point graduate holding an army commission
and as fearless in assuming responsibility as the average graduate
would not only have prevented my making this important contract but
would have blocked my efforts in every direction for in all Europe the
