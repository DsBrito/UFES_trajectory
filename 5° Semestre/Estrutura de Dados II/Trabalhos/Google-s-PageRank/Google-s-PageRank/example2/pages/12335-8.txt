all of the newest Round face round and earnest eyes short
selfconfident nose chin sticking out in search of its own way mouth
trembling with unuttered ideas Good figurewhat Lord Dundreary would
call dem robust but not so sumptuous as to be merely ornamental
tolerably convenient figure to get about in Walks up and down
manfashion with her hands behind her backalso manfashion Such is
Mrs Maria Stanley the sister of Clara Van Diemens father and best
known to Clara as Aunt Maria
And so this is Santa Fe said Aunt Maria rolling her spectacles over
the little wilted city Founded in 1581 two hundred and seventy years
old Well if this is all that man can do in that time he had better
leave colonization to woman
Clara smiled with an innocent air of half wonder and half amusement such
as you may see on the face of a child when it is shown some new and rather
awestriking marvel of the universe whether a jackinabox or a comet
She had only known Aunt Maria for the last four years and she had not yet
got used to her roughandready mannish ways nor learned to see any sense
in her philosophizings Looking upon her as a comical character and
supposing that she talked mainly for the fun of the thing she was
disposed to laugh at her doings and sayings though mostly meant in solemn
earnest
But about your affairs my child continued Aunt Maria suddenly
gripping a fresh subject after her quick and startling fashion I dont
understand them How is it possible Here is a great fortune gone gone in
a moment gone incomprehensibly What does it mean Some rascality here
Some man at the bottom of this
I presume my relative Garcia must be right commenced Clara
No he isnt interrupted Aunt Maria He is wrong Of course hes
wrong I never knew a man yet but what he was wrong
You make me laugh in spite of my troubles said Clara laughing
however only through her eyes which had great faculties for sparkling
out meanings But see here she added turning grave again and putting
up her hand to ask attention Mr Garcia tells a straight story and
gives reasons enough There was the war and here she began to count on
her fingers That destroyed a great deal I know when my father could
scarcely send on money to pay my bills in New York And then there was the
signature for Senor Pedraez And then there were the Apaches who burnt the
hacienda and drove off the cattle And then he
Her voice faltered and she stopped she could not say He died
My poor dear child sighed Aunt Maria walking up to the girl and
caressing her with a tenderness which was all womanly
That seems enough continued Clara when she could speak again I
suppose that what Garcia and the lawyers tell us is true I suppose I am
not worth a thousand dollars
Will a thousand dollars support you here
I dont know I dont think it will
Then if I cant set this thing straight if I cant make somebody
disgorge your property I must take you back with me
Oh if you would implored Clara all the tender helplessness of Spanish
girlhood appealing from her eyes
Of course I will said Aunt Maria with a benevolent energy which was
almost terrific
I would try to do something I dont know Couldnt I teach Spanish
You shant decided Aunt Maria Yes you shall You shall be
professor of foreign languages in a Female College which I mean to have
founded
Clara stared with astonishment and then burst into a hearty fit of
laughter the two finishing the drying of her tears She was so far from
wishing to be a strongminded person of either gender that she did not
comprehend that her aunt could wish it for her or could herself seriously
claim to be one The talk about a professorship was in her estimation the
wayward humorous whim of an eccentric who was fond of solemn joking Mrs
Stanley meanwhile could not see why her utterance should not be taken in
earnest and opened her eyes at Claras merriment
We must say a word or two concerning the past of this young lady
Twentyfive years previous a New Yorker named Augustus Van Diemen the
brother of that Maria Jane Van Diemen now known to the world as Mrs
Stanley had migrated to California set up in the hide business and
married by stealth the daughter of a wealthy Mexican named Pedro Munoz
Munoz got into a Spanish Catholic rage at having a Yankee Protestant
soninlaw disowned and formally disinherited his child and worried her
husband into quitting the country Van Diemen returned to the United
States but his wife soon became homesick for her native land and like a
good husband as he was he went once more to Mexico This time he settled
in Santa Fe where he accumulated a handsome fortune lived in the best
house in the city and owned haciendas
Claras mother dying when the girl was fourteen years old Van Diemen felt
free to give her his only child an American education and sent her to
New York where she went through four years of schooling During this
period came the war between the United States and Mexico Foreign
residents were illtreated Van Diemen was sometimes a prisoner sometimes
a fugitive in one way or another his fortune went to pieces Four months
previous to the opening of this story he died in a state little better
than insolvency Clara returning to Santa Fe under the care of her
energetic and affectionate relative found that the deluge of debt would
cover town house and haciendas leaving her barely a thousand dollars She
was handsome and accomplished but she was an orphan and poor The main
chance with her seemed to lie in the likelihood that she would find a
mother or a father in Aunt Maria
Yes there was another sustaining possibility and of a more poetic
nature There was a young American officer named Thurstane a second
lieutenant acting as quartermaster of the department who had met her
heretofore in New York who had seemed delighted to welcome her to Santa
Fe and who now called on her nearly every day Might it not be that
Lieutenant Thurstane would want to make her Mrs Thurstane and would have
power granted him to induce her to consent to the arrangement Clara was
sufficiently a woman and sufficiently a Spanish woman especially to
believe in marriage She did not mean particularly to be Mrs Thurstane
but she did mean generally to be Mrs Somebody And why not Thurstane
Well that was for him to decide at least to a considerable extent In
the mean time she did not love him she only disliked the thought of
leaving him
While these two women had been talking and thinking a lazy Indian servant
had been lounging up the stairway Arrived on the roof he advanced to La
Senorita Clara and handed her a letter The girl opened it glanced
through it with a flushing face and cried out delightedly It is from my
grandfather How wonderful O holy Maria thanks His heart has been
softened He invites me to come and live with him in San Francisco O
Madre de Dios
Although Clara spoke English perfectly and although she was in faith
quite as much of a Protestant as a Catholic yet in her moments of strong
excitement she sometimes fell back into the language and ideas of her
childhood
Child what are you jabbering about asked Aunt Maria
There it is See Pedro Munoz It is his own signature I have seen
letters of his Pedro Munoz Read it Oh you dont read Spanish
Then she translated the letter aloud Aunt Maria listened with a firm and
almost stern aspect like one who sees some justice done but not enough
He doesnt beg your pardon she said at the close of the reading
Clara supposing that she was expected to laugh and not seeing the point
of the joke stared in amazement
But probably he is in a meeker mood now continued Aunt Maria By this
time it is to be hoped that he sees his past conduct in a proper light
The letter was written three months ago
Three months ago repeated Clara Yes it has taken all that time to
come How long will it take me to go there How shall I go
We will see said Aunt Maria with the air of one who holds the fates in
her hand and doesnt mean to open it till she gets ready She was by no
means satisfied as yet that this grandfather Munoz was a proper person to
be intrusted with the destinies of a young lady In refusing to let his
daughter select her own husband he had shown a very squinting and
incomplete perception of the rights of woman
Old reprobate thought Aunt Maria Probably he has got gouty with his
vices and wants to be nursed I fancy I see him getting Clara without
going on his sore marrowbones and begging pardon of gods and women
Of course I must go continued Clara unsuspicious of her aunts
reflections At all events he will support me Besides he is now the
head of my family
Head of the family frowned Aunt Maria Because he is a man So much
the more reason for his being the tail of it My dear you are your own
head
Ahwell What is the use of all that asked Clara smiling away those
views I have no money and he has
Well we will see persisted Aunt Maria I just told you so We will
see
The two women had scarcely left the roof of the house and got themselves
down to the large breezy sparsely furnished parlor ere the lazy
dawdling Indian servant announced Lieutenant Thurstane
Lieutenant Ralph Thurstane was a tall fullchested finelylimbed
gladiator of perhaps four and twenty Broad forehead nose straight and
high enough lower part of the face oval on the whole a good physiognomy
Cheek bones rather strongly marked a hint of Scandinavian ancestry
supported by his name Thurstane is evidently Thors stone or altar
forefathers priests of the god of thunder His complexion was so reddened
and darkened by sunburn that his untanned forehead looked unnaturally
white and delicate His yellow one might almost call it golden hair was
wavy enough to be handsome Eyes quite remarkable blue but of a very
dark blue like the coloring which is sometimes given to steel so dark
indeed that ones first impression was that they were black Their natural
expression seemed to be gentle pathetic and almost imploring but
authority responsibility hardship and danger had given them an ability
to be stern In his whole face young as he was there was already the
look of the veteran that calm reminiscence of trials endured that
preparedness for trials to come In fine taking figure physiognomy and
demeanor together he was attractive
He saluted the ladies as if they were his superior officers It was a
kindly address but ceremonious it was almost humble and yet it was
selfrespectful
I have some great news he presently said in the full masculine tone of
one who has done much drilling That is it is great to me I change
station
How is that asked Clara eagerly She was not troubled at the thought of
losing a beau we must not be so hard upon her as to make that
supposition but here was a trustworthy friend going away just when she
wanted counsel and perhaps aid
I have been promoted first lieutenant of Company I Fifth Regiment and I
must join my company
Promoted I am glad said Clara
You ought to be pleased put in Aunt Maria staring at the grave face of
the young man with no approving expression I thought men were always
pleased with such things
So I am returned Thurstane Of course I am pleased with the step But
I must leave Santa Fe And I have found Santa Fe very pleasant
There was so much meaning obvious in these last words that Claras face
colored like a sunset
I thought soldiers never indulged in such feelings continued the
unmollified Aunt Maria
Soldiers are but men observed Thurstane flushing through his sunburn
And men are weak creatures
Thurstane grew still redder This old lady old in his young eyes was
always at him about his manship as if it were a crime and disgrace He
wanted to give her one but out of respect for Clara he did not and
merely moved uneasily in his seat as men are apt to do when they are set
down hard
How soon must you go Where demanded Clara
As soon as I can close my accounts here and turn over my stores to my
successor Company I is at Fort Yuma on the Colorado It is the first post
in California
California And Clara could not help brightening up in cheeks and eyes
with fine tints and flashes Why I am going to California
We will see said Aunt Maria still holding the fates in her fist
Then came the story of Grandfather Munozs letter with a hint or two
concerning the decay of the Van Diemen fortune for Clara was not worldly
wise enough to hide her poverty
Thurstanes face turned as red with pleasure as if it had been dipped in
the sun If this young lady was going to California he might perhaps be
her knighterrant across the desert guard her from privations and
hardships and crown himself with her smiles If she was poor he
mightwell he would not speculate upon that it was too dizzying
We must say a word as to his history in order to show why he was so shy
and sensitive He had been through West Point confined himself while
there closely to his studies gone very soon into active service and so
seen little society The discipline of the Academy and three years in the
regular army had ground into him the soldiers respect for superiors He
revered his field officers he received a communication from the War
Department as a sort of superhuman revelation he would have blown himself
skyhigh at the command of General Scott This habit of subordination
coupled with a natural fund of reverence led him to feel that many
persons were better than himself and to be humble in their presence All
women were his superior officers and the highest in rank was Clara Van
Diemen
Well hurrah he was to march under her to California and the thought
made him half wild He would protect her he would kill all the Indians in
the desert for her sake he would feed her on his own blood if necessary
As he considered these proper and feasible projects the audacious thought
which he had just tried to expel from his mind forced its way back into
it If the Van Diemen estate were insolvent if this semidivine Clara
were as poor as himself there was a call on him to double his devotion to
her and there was a hope that his worship might some day be rewarded
How he would slave and serve for her how he would earn promotion for her
sake how he would fight her battle in life But would she let him do it
Ah it seemed too much to hope Poor though she was she was still a
heaven or so above him she was so beautiful and had so many perfections
Oh the purity the selfabnegation the humility of love It makes a man
scarcely lower than the angels and quite superior to not a few reverenced
saints
CHAPTER II
I must say observed ThurstaneI beg your pardon for advisingbut I
think you had better accept your grandfathers invitation
He said it with a pang at his heart for if this adorable girl went to her
grandfather the old fellow would be sure to love her and leave her his
property in which case there would be no chance for a proud and poor
lieutenant He gave his advice under a grim sense that it was his duty to
give it because the following of it would be best for Miss Van Diemen
So I think nodded Clara fortified by this opinion to resist Aunt
Maria and the more fortified because it was the opinion of a man
After a certain amount of discussion the elder lady was persuaded to
loosen her mighty grip and give the destinies a little liberty
Well it may be best she said pursing her mouth as if she tasted the
bitter of some halfsuspected and disagreeable future I dont know I
wont undertake positively to decide But if you do go and here she
became authentic and despoticif you do go I shall go with you and see
you safe there
Oh will you exclaimed Clara all Spanish and all emotion in an
instant How sweet and good and beautiful of you You are my guardian
angel Do you know I thought you would offer to go I said to myself She
came on to Santa Fe for my sake and she will go to California But oh it
is too much for me to ask How shall I ever pay you
I will pay myself returned Aunt Maria I have plans for California
It was as if she had said Go to we will make California in our own
image
The young lady was satisfied Her strongminded relative was a mighty
mystery to her just as men were mighty mysteries Whatever she or they
said could be done and should be done why of course it would be done and
that shortly
By the time that Aunt Maria had announced her decision another visitor
was on the point of entrance Carlos Maria Munoz Garcia de Coronado was a
nephew of Manuel Garcia who was a cousin of Claras grandfather only as
Garcia was merely his uncle by marriage Coronado and Clara were not
related by blood though calling each other cousin He was a man of medium
stature slender in build agile and graceful in movement complexion very
dark features high and aristocratic short black hair and small black
moustache eyes black also but veiled and dusky He was about
twentyeight but he seemed at least four years older partly because of a
deep wrinkle which slashed down each cheek and partly because he was so
perfectly selfpossessed and elaborately courteous His intellect was
apparently as alert and adroit as his physical action A few words from
Clara enabled him to seize the situation
Go at once he decided without a moments hesitation My dear cousin
it will be the happy turning point of your fortunes I fancy you already
inheriting the hoards city lots haciendas mines and cattle of our
excellent relative Munozlong may he live to enjoy them Certainly Dont
whisper an objection Munoz owes you that reparation His conduct has
beenwe will not describe itwe will hope that he means to make amends
for it Unquestionably he will My dear cousin nothing can resist you
You will enchant your grandfather It will all end like the tales of the
Arabian Nights in your living in a palace How delightful to think of
this long family quarrel at last coming to a close But how do you go
If Miss Van Diemen goes overland I can do something toward protecting
her and making her comfortable suggested Thurstane I am ordered to
Fort Yuma
Coronado glanced at the young officer noted the guilty blush which peeped
out of his tanned cheek and came to a decision on the instant
Overland he exclaimed lifting both his hands Take her overland My
God my God
Thurstane reddened at the insinuation that he had given bad advice to Miss
Van Diemen but though he wanted to fight the Mexican he controlled
himself and did not even argue Like all sensitive and at the same time
selfrespectful persons he was exceedingly considerate of the feelings of
others and was a very lamb in conversation
It is a desert continued Coronado in a kind of scream of horror It is
a waterless desert without a blade of grass and haunted from end to end
by Apaches My little cousin would die of thirst and hunger She would be
hunted and scalped O my God overland
Emigrant parties are going all the while ventured Thurstane very angry
at such extravagant opposition but merely looking a little stiff
Certainly You are right Lieutenant bowed Coronado They do go But
how many perish on the way They march between the unburied and withered
corpses of their predecessors And what a journey for a womanfor a lady
accustomed to luxuryfor my little cousin I beg your pardon my dear
Lieutenant Thurstane for disagreeing with you My advice isthe
isthmus
I have of course nothing to say admitted the officer returning
Coronados bow The family must decide
Certainly the isthmus the steamers went on the fluent Mexican You
sail to Panama You have an easy and safe land trip of a few days Then
steamers again Poff you are there By all means the isthmus
We must allot a few more words of description to this Don Carlos Coronado
Let no one expect a stage Spaniard with the air of a matador or a
guerrillero who wears only picturesque and outlandish costumes and
speaks only magniloquent Castilian Coronado was dressed on this spring
morning precisely as American dandies then dressed for summer promenades
on Broadway His hat was a fine panama with a broad black ribbon his
frockcoat was of thin cloth plain dark and altogether civilized his
light trousers were cut gaiterfashion and strapped under the instep his
small boots were patentleather and of the ordinary type There was
nothing poetic about his attire except a reasonably wide Byron collar and
a rather dashing crimson necktie well suited to his dark complexion
His manner was sometimes excitable as we have seen above but usually he
was like what gentlemen with us desire to be Perhaps he bowed lower and
smiled oftener and gestured more gracefully than Americans are apt to do
But there was in general nothing Oriental about him no assumption of
barbaric pompousness no extravagance of bearing His prevailing
deportment was calm grave and deliciously courteous If you had met him
no matter how or where you would probably have been pleased with him He
would have made conversation for you and put you at ease in a moment you
would have believed that he liked you and you would therefore have been
disposed to like him In short he was agreeable to most people and to
some people fascinating
And then his English It was wonderful to hear him talk it No American
could say that he spoke better English than Coronado and no American
surely ever spoke it so fluently It rolled off his lips in a torrent
undefiled by a mispronunciation or a foreign idiom And yet he had begun
to learn the language after reaching the age of manhood and had acquired
it mainly during three years of exile and teaching of Spanish in the
United States His linguistic cleverness was a fair specimen of his
general quickness of intellect
Mrs Stanley had liked him at first sightthat is liked him for a man
He knew it he had seen that she was a person worth conciliating he had
addressed himself to her let off his bows at her made her the centre of
conversation In ten minutes from the entrance of Coronado Mrs Stanley
was of opinion that Clara ought to go to California by way of the isthmus
although she had previously taken the overland route for granted In
another ten minutes the matter was settled the ladies were to go by way
of New Orleans Panama and the Pacific
Shortly afterward Coronado and Thurstane took their leave the Mexican
affable sociable smiling smoking the American civil but taciturn and
grave
Aha I have disappointed the young gentleman thought Coronado as they
parted the one going to his quartermasters office and the other to
Garcias house
Coronado although he had spent great part of his life in courting women
was a bachelor He had been engaged once in New Mexico and two or three
times in New York but had always as he could tell you with a smile been
disappointed He now lived with his uncle that Senor Manuel Garcia whom
Clara has mentioned a trader with California an owner of vast estates
and much cattle and reputed to be one of the richest men in New Mexico
The two often quarrelled and the elder had once turned the younger out of
doors so lively were their dispositions But as Garcia had lost one by
one all his children he had at last taken his nephew into permanent
favor and would it was said leave him his property
The house a hollow square built of adobe bricks in one story covered a
vast deal of ground had spacious rooms and a court big enough to bivouac
a regiment It was in fact not only a dwelling but a magazine where
Garcia stored his merchandise and a caravansary where he parked his
wagons As Coronado lounged into the main doorway he was run against by a
short pursy old gentleman who was rushing out
Ah there you are exclaimed the old gentleman in Spanish O you pig
you dog you never are here O Madre de Dios how I have needed you There
is no time to lose Enter at once
A dyspeptic worn with work and anxieties his nervous system shattered
Garcia was subject to fits of petulance which were ludicrous In these
rages he called everybody who would bear it pigs dogs and other more
unsavory nicknames Coronado bore it because thus he got his living and
got it without much labor
I want you gasped Garcia seizing the young man by the arm and dragging
him into a private room I want to speak to you in confidencein
confidence mind you in confidenceabout Munoz
I have heard of it said Coronado as the old man stopped to catch his
breath
Heard of it exclaimed Garcia in such consternation that he turned
yellow which was his way of turning pale Has the news got here O Madre
de Dios
Yes I was at our little cousins this evening It is an ugly affair
And she knows it groaned the old man O Madre de Dios
She told me of it She is going there I did the best I could She was
about to go overland in charge of the American Thurstane I broke that
up I persuaded her to go by the isthmus
It is of little use said Garcia his eyes filmy with despair as if he
were dying She will get there The property will be hers
Not necessarily He has simply invited her to live with him She may not
suit
How demanded Garcia openeyed and openmouthed with anxiety
He has simply invited her to live with him repeated Coronado I saw
the letter
What you dont know then
Know what
Munoz is dead
Coronado threw out first a stare of surprise and then a shout of
laughter
And here they have just got a letter from him he said presently and I
have been persuading her to go to him by the isthmus
May the journey take her to him muttered Garcia How old was this
letter
Nearly three months It came by sea first to New York and then here
My news is a month later It came overland by special messenger Listen
to me Carlos This affair is worse than you know Do you know what Munoz
has done Oh the pig the dog the villainous pig He has left everything
to his granddaughter
Coronado dumb with astonishment and dismay mechanically slapped his boot
with his cane and stared at Garcia
I am ruined cried the old man The pig of hell has ruined me He has
left me his cousin his only male relative to ruin Not a doubloon to
save me
Is there no chance asked Coronado after a long silence
None Ohyesone A little one a miserable little one If she dies
without issue and without a will I am heir And you Carlos changing
here to a wheedling tone you are mine
The look which accompanied these last words was a terrible mingling of
cunning cruelty hope and despair
Coronado glanced at Garcia with a shocking comprehension and immediately
dropped his dusky eyes upon the floor
You know I have made my will resumed the old man and left you
everything
Which is nothing returned Coronado aware that his uncle was insolvent
in reality and that his estate when settled would not show the residuum
of a dollar
If the fortune of Munoz comes to me I shall be very rich
When you get it
Listen to me Carlos Is there no way of getting it
As the two men stared at each other they were horrible The uncle was
always horrible he was one of the very ugliest of Spaniards he was a
brutal caricature of the national type He had a low forehead round face
bulbous nose shaking fat cheeks insignificant chin and only one eye a
black and sleepy orb which seemed to crawl like a snake His exceedingly
dark skin was made darker by a singular bluish tinge which resulted from
heavy doses of nitrate of silver taken as a remedy for epilepsy His face
was moreover mottled with dusky spots so that he reminded the spectator
of a frog or a toad Just now he looked nothing less than poisonous the
hungriest of cannibals would not have dared eat him
I am ruined he went on groaning The war the Yankees the Apaches
the devilI am completely ruined In another year I shall be sold out
Then my dear Carlos you will have no home
Sangre de Dios growled Coronado Do you want to drive me to the
devil
O God to force an old man to such an extremity continued Garcia It
is more than an old man is fitted to strive with An old manan old
sick wornout man
You are sure about the will demanded the nephew
I have a copy of it said Garcia eagerly Here it is Read it O Madre
de Dios there is no doubt about it I can trust my lawyer It all goes to
her It only comes to me if she dies childless and intestate
This is a horrible dilemma to force us into observed Coronado after he
had read the paper
So it is assented Garcia looking at him with indescribable anxiety
So it is so it is What is to be done
Suppose I should marry her
The old mans countenance fell he wanted to call his nephew a pig a dog
and everything else that is villainous but he restrained himself and
merely whimpered It would be better than nothing You could help me
There is little chance of it said Coronado seeing that the proposition
was not approved She likes the American lieutenant much and does not
like me at all
Then began Garcia and stopped there trembling all over
Then what
The venomous old toad made a supreme effort and whispered Suppose she
should die
Coronado wheeled about walked two or three times up and down the room
returned to where Garcia sat quivering and murmured It must be done
quickly
Yes yes gasped the old man She mustit must be childless and
intestate
She must go off in some natural way continued the nephew
The uncle looked up with a vague hope in his one dusky and filmy eye
Perhaps the isthmus will do it for her
Again the old man turned to an image of despair as he mumbled O Madre
de Dios no no The isthmus is nothing
Is the overland route more dangerous asked Coronado
It might be made more dangerous One gets lost in the desert There are
Apaches
It is a horrible business growled Coronado shaking his head and biting
his lips
Oh horrible horrible groaned Garcia Munoz was a pig and a dog and
a toad and a snake
You old coward cant you speak out hissed Coronado losing his
patience Do you want me both to devise and execute while you take the
purses Tell me at once what your plan is
The overland route whispered Garcia shaking from head to foot You go
with her I payI pay everything You shall have men horses mules
wagons all you want
