when extra expenses are necessary and then the Government taxes the
people to meet them
This is what President McKinley proposes to do now
The new tax proposed is to be a revenue tariff on all articles of foreign
manufacture that are brought into this country
The extra session of Congress is to consider and if possible pass the
Tariff Bill which it is desired shall go into effect May 1st of this
year
The bill is being introduced by Congressman Nelson Dingley of Maine who
is Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee in the House of
Representatives It is known as the Dingley Bill and it is said will
increase the income of the Government over one hundred millions
It is said by people who are against the bill that if it passes the
cost of living will become much greater People who are in favor of it say
that by preventing goods of foreign manufacture from being brought into
the country our own industries will greatly increase and our trade be
much benefited
There is one section of the bill which will make it very unpopular to many
of our citizens
This paragraph states that tourists and people visiting foreign countries
shall only be allowed to bring one hundred dollars worth of wearing
apparel into the country free of duty
When you think that you can get little more than a whole change of
costume hat boots and gloves complete for a hundred dollars and that
people who are rich enough to travel in foreign countries give three and
four times that sum for a single outfit you can understand just how much
that paragraph is going to be liked
It is true that the law says that people may bring back with them the
articles they take away provided they can prove that they took them out
of the country But think of the worry and annoyance of arguing with the
Custom House officers as to where and when each garment in your trunk was
bought
If it goes into effect this law will certainly prevent a great many
people from travelling for the hours of heated argument with the
officials on the dock on the travellers return would undo all the good
of their trip
The present Custom House system is about as trying to a persons nerves as
anything can be and not a little of the trouble comes from the fact that
you must not show the slightest annoyance when the officer dives into your
trunk and punches at the corner which contains your best hat or feels in
the folds of a delicate silk skirt leaving marks of dusty fingers behind
him The least show of temper from you will result in the officers
claiming his right to have the whole contents of your various trunks
dumped out on the wharf and repacked under his eye
It is to be hoped that the 100 paragraph may be changed but with or
without it it seems as if the passage of the Dingley Bill may be the best
thing for the country
The bill is called An Act to provide revenue for the Government and
encourage the industries of the United States
The Powers have not sent any further word to Greece
They have been waiting to hear what France has to say
As we told you last week the people of France were not willing to take
part in any severe measures against Greece the Government was quite
willing but dared not make any promises without the consent of the
Chamber of Deputies the French Congress
The Powers decided to wait until the Prime Minister had had time to ask
the Chamber of Deputies if it was willing to support the Government
At the last meeting the Minister put the question to the Chambersaying
that the Government had decided that the proper course for France would be
to remain in the concert of the Powers and insist that Greece withdraw
her troops from Crete
Much discussion followed the Ministers speech It had been expected that
the Chamber of Deputies would refuse and insist upon a change in the
Government To the surprise of everybody a vote was passed approving the
policy of the Government and agreeing to uphold it
So France joins her voice with those of the other Powers and calls on
Greece to give in
After the Chamber of Deputies adjourned orders were sent to Toulon a
seaport on the Mediterranean Sea at the south of France ordering
soldiers at once to Crete
Illustration Warships on the Harbor of the Pirus Seaport of Athens
The Admirals of the allied fleets have received orders to blockade the
ports of Crete and if this fails to make the Greeks obedient to the
wishes of the Powers the Pirus and the ports of Greece are also to be
blockaded
On receipt of these orders the Admirals proceeded to put them into effect
and the Cretan ports are now blockaded
It is said that the Greek fleet has withdrawn from Turkish waters
The Greek Cabinet Ministers had a very long and serious talk over the
present state of affairs It was decided that on no account would the
Greek troops be withdrawn from Crete and that if the Powers tried to
force Greece into obedience she must take active measures
These active measures are understood to mean the declaration of war
against Turkey
It is said that two bands of Thessalians have invaded Macedonia
Thessaly is that part of Greece which borders on Turkey and Macedonia is
a part of the Turkish Empire bordering on Greece that at one time formed
part of the Greek Empire
There are many Greeks in Macedonia and if war is declared it is expected
that they will rise and go to the aid of their mother country
The invasion of Turkey by the Thessalians does not mean that war is
declared It is merely a rising of the border peoples against their
neighbors and has nothing to do with the Greek Government
The Crown Prince of Greece Constantino Duke of Sparta is leaving
Athens to take command of the Greek forces in Thessaly and be ready to
lead them if war is declared
The news that the Greek ports are to be blockaded has made the Greeks
hasten their preparations The troops are being hurried off to Thessaly
with all possible despatch
Illustration CRETAN SOLDIERS RETREATING INTO THE MOUNTAINS
There are reports that the Greeks are so enraged against the Emperor of
Germany for his behavior over Crete that the priests have openly said in
the churches that it is a great misfortune that the future King of Greece
is married to the sister of Greeces worst enemy
In 1889 the Crown Prince married the Princess Sophia of Germany sister of
the young German Emperor
The Greek statesmen are openly urging the Prince to divorce his wife
because of her relationship to the German Emperor
Does not this seem terrible
The Crown Prince and Princess have three children the youngest a baby not
yet a year old For the sake of politics the Greeks would like to have the
Crown Prince send his wife back to her own country and separate her from
her children
It cannot be a happy thing to come of a race of kings and be such a great
personage that even the happiness of home must be sacrificed for the
interests of State
Our friend Weyler is in a heap of trouble
It seems that affairs in the Philippines look worse for Spain than was at
first supposed
The Spanish troops have been very severely beaten lately near Manilla and
the rebellion is so strong and so well organized that unless fresh troops
can be sent immediately the Philippines will be lost to Spain
The insurgents are so successful that they are even venturing to offer
pardons to all Spaniards except the CaptainGeneral who will lay down
their arms and peacefully obey the new government
Spain does not however intend to give up the Philippines yet a while
and as she is not in a position to spare more men from home for fear of
the Carlists rising she has sent to Weyler and ordered him to dispatch
20000 men to the Philippines without delay
This is what is troubling Weyler
Some months ago word was sent to the Spanish Government that Weyler was
robbing the treasury by drawing full pay for numbers of men who had been
killed by the Cubans but whose names were still on the payrolls
The matter was inquired into but before it could get very far Weyler made
such indignant denials and protested his innocence so strongly that the
Prime Minister cabled a message assuring him of his confidence in him and
the matter was allowed to drop
At the time of these accusations Weyler assured the Government that he had
160000 men in his army
When the Carlist and Philippine troubles began to be serious the Spanish
Government decided to take 20000 men from Cuba and send them on to the
Philippines at the same time issuing a call to the loyal Spaniards in
Cuba to take up arms and fill the places of the men drafted to the other
war
The plan was a good one and would have worked well enough if Weyler had
spoken the truth about the number of men under his command
The fact was that his statement was altogether false
His force in Cuba consisted of but 100000 men The other 60000 had
either been killed by the Cubans or were lying sick in hospitals
Weyler had no 20000 men to spare but he did not dare tell the truth lest
the facts of his knavery might come out
He made up his mind to send the troops and then if things went wrong in
Cuba to declare that the withdrawal of the soldiers had paralyzed him
and cost him Cuba
Some one however sent word to Senor Canovas of the true state of
affairs and some very plain messages have been passing between Spain and
Cuba
The men are to go anyhow but with only a force of 80000 men left behind
Spain has little hope of pacifying Cuba
The insurgents have or will have when the Spanish troops are sent away
as many men at their command as the Spaniards have and they feel very
confident of success because the men under them are well fed healthy
and hopeful while the poor Spanish soldiers are hungry sick and
despairing

Assistant
It seems as if the Cubans have now a better chance of winning their
freedom than they have ever had and if they fail it will be their own
fault
A pleasant piece of news in connection with all the rest is that the
infamous Fondeviella has been removed from the command in Guanabacoa His
resignation has been asked for from Madrid and another officer has been
appointed in his place
Fondeviella is the bloodthirsty Spanish soldier who while acting as Mayor
of Guanabacoa caused the murder of so many innocent persons Dr Ruiz
among the number
This savage man is declared to have said that for every account of Spanish
cruelty published in American newspapers he would have an American life
It is said that the examination of the body of poor Dr Ruiz has revealed
the fact that he was beaten to death and so Fondeviella has been removed
The dispatches that mention him now speak of him as Colonel Fondeviella
When he went to Guanabacoa his rank was only that of Major It would seem
that his atrocious conduct has not prevented the Spaniards from promoting
him
It is reported that the Laurada has safely landed her cargo and
passengers in Cuba and that the expedition which sailed from these
shores under the command of Colonel Roloff has joined the force of
General Garcia
Gomez is said to be waiting for the cannon and supplies that Roloff brings
him before he advances farther to the west to join Ruis Rivera
War clouds are hanging low over South America
Two rebellions have broken out there
The first is in Brazil
Brazil is the largest of the South American countries The Amazon which
you all remember is the greatest river in the world flows through Brazil
Until 1889 Brazil was a monarchy the only monarchy in South America In
November of that year there was a revolution the Emperor was dethroned
and forced to leave the country It has been a republic ever since under
the name of the United States of Brazil
In February last a rebellion broke out which it was found had been started
by the monarchists
Monarchists are people who would rather be ruled by a monarch than by the
will of the people In Brazil there is quite a large party of these
monarchists who would gladly see an emperor on the throne again
The news from Brazil states that there has been some heavy fighting
between the two parties and that the government troops have been
defeated and one of the favorite generals killed
The people are so indignant over this that they are mobbing houses and
places of business belonging to people who sympathize with the
monarchists
The Government has sent 10000 troops to Bahia where the fighting is at
present going on and is determined to put the war down with a firm hand
The other war is in Uruguay
Uruguay is a small republic just south of Brazil
This is another civil war
The President has become unpopular with the people and they are trying to
get rid of him and put some one else in his place
This little war is hardly worth speaking of at all Toy revolutions are
constantly occurring first in one and then another of the South American
republics and people have grown so accustomed to them that they hardly
notice them now
Uruguay though a very small country is particularly fond of these
disturbances The entire population of the whole country is no larger than
that of the city of Brooklyn but this handful of people manage to have
enough revolts and disturbances to keep the country in constant
excitement
This present tempest is receiving more attention than is usual because it
is supposed that the monarchists of Brazil are stirring the people of
Uruguay to rebellion with the hope of overthrowing both governments at
the same time joining the two countries together and uniting them under
the one emperor
If this report is true the matter is worthy of serious attention because
Brazil is not one of the little insignificant republics whose perpetual
disturbances affect no one but themselves but a large and important
country and changes in the government of Brazil would be liable to affect
all the other countries which trade with it
A party of wealthy Chinese merchants arrived in New York the other day
from San Francisco They were on their way to Washington to see the
Chinese Minister and ask him to intercede for them with the Emperor of
China
Their trouble is that the Emperor has kindly invited ten of them to visit
China without delay two to have their heads chopped off and the other
eight to be imprisoned for life
Of course none of the Chinamen are going to accept the Emperors
invitation and so they are not seeking the help of the Minister for
themselves Their anxiety is on account of their relatives
It would seem that one of the curious little customs they have in China is
to arrest all the relatives of a man accused of crime as well as the
criminal himself These unfortunate people they cast into prison taking
away from them their property and everything of value they possess This
punishment is for no known reason but that they have had the misfortune to
be members of the same family as a rascal
The consequence is that when a Chinaman gets into trouble his relatives
instead of standing by him and trying to help him desert him with the
greatest possible speed and do their best to hide themselves in less
dangerous districts
While the Chinamen who are now in this country are able to laugh at the
Emperors decree and have no intention of going where he can make things
unpleasant for them they are horrorstruck at the way their poor
relatives have been stampeded A number of these have been thrown into
jail and only the nimblest have managed to escape the imperial vengeance
The Chinese merchants feel that this is very hard because they have never
been tried and convicted of any crime and this punishment has fallen upon
them because of a report of the Consul in San Francisco which they say is
absolutely false
It seems that the Consul sent word to the Minister in Washington that
these ten men were rebels and full of treason that they were plotting
the overthrow of the Emperor of China and were collecting arms for that
purpose
The Minister sent the report on to the Emperor and his Celestial Majesty
fearful lest these ten men might overthrow his kingdom instantly ordered
them to come right home and have their heads chopped off
The accused Chinese merchants say that they are innocent and that the
charge was made against them by their enemies and of enemies they seem to
have an unlimited number
It appears that Chinese society is a very complicated affair
The Chinese in their own country live in families and clans after the
manner of the Scotch and like the ancient Scotch people there are
frequently terrible feuds or quarrels between the various clans If one
man of a clan offends a man of another clan the two entire clans take up
the quarrel and every man of the one clan is ready to fight any man of
the other clan and injure him as far as lies in his power
In China as in Scotland families or clans consist of every living member
or connection of the family
In China the affairs of every member of the family are managed by a
council This council consists of the elders men over sixty years of
age and the scholars We told you in No 1 of THE GREAT ROUND
WORLD what severe trials a man has to go through in China before he
can be called a scholar
It is the duty of this council to collect and save all moneys due to any
member of the family to direct the business of their households and to
manage the family and its affairs so completely that the members of the
family are like children under the guidance of a very careful parent and
when they come to this country and are obliged to think and act for
themselves they are no more capable of doing so than they would be if
they were really children
To meet this difficulty and help the Chinamen an organization called the
First Company was formed in San Francisco which undertook the duties of
the elders of the families and was a great comfort to the Chinamen in
America
By and by as more Chinamen came into the country the First Company got
too large and others were formed on the same principle until finally
there were six companies altogether Then other societies were formed by
the Chinamen and among them the Sam Yup and the See Yup
These two societies seem to have the true clannish spirit and a hatred
and rivalry exist between them that remind one of the stories of the
Middle Ages
Belonging to the Sam Yups was a Chinaman named Little Pete and it is
indirectly through him that trouble has fallen upon the heads of the ten
Chinese merchants
If what is said about him is true Little Pete must have been a very great
rascal He was a wellknown character in San Francisco and there was no
work too bad or too wicked for him to undertake
Among his other crimes he bribed juries and had a whole regiment of
witnesses ready to swear as he wished
The See Yups knew all about this and so when a case was coming into
court against any of their members they would go to Little Pete and hire
his witnesses to swear for themwell knowing that if they didnt do
this Little Pete would have them there to swear against the See Yups
By these means Little Pete grew very rich and was as much hated by his
enemies of the See Yups as admired by his friends of the Sam Yups
Time passed on and Little Pete full of his power began to make the tax
on the See Yups a little heavier than they could submit to They appealed
to the Consul He took no notice of them They went to Washington accused
the Consul of being in league with the Sam Yups and asked that he be
dismissed
The Minister would have nothing to do with them and they went back to San
Francisco vowing vengeance on Little Pete
With the Chinese murder is very lightly regarded and Little Pete never
doubted that his enemies of the See Yups would try to murder him when they
got back from Washington For weeks he went about wearing a coat of mail
and followed by two sturdy Sam Yups his hired guards
One night he went into the barbers and feeling safe sent his guards
away The See Yups were watching for just such an opportunity and rushed
into the shop and killed him
Every effort was made to find the murderers Several men were arrested
but it was not possible to show that they were connected with the crime
so nothing could be done
The news of the murder was sent on to China and there the matter should
have rested but that the two rival societies declared a boycott on each
other
The Consul got tired of this and insisted that it be stopped The See
Yups obeyed but grumbled and gave the Consul a great deal of trouble
The quarrelling still kept on and finally the Consul sent the fatal
letter accusing the ten See Yups of treason
The See Yups declare that they can prove that the Consul is in league with
the Sam Yups and that he has made this false accusation against them to
oblige the Sam Yup society
Their only hope is that the Minister who returns to China very shortly
may straighten matters out for them If he will not help them they will
have to choose between going back to China and having their heads cut off
and allowing their innocent relatives to be punished for them
It will interest you to know that this is Maple Sugar time and that all
through New England the manufacture of the delicious Maple Sugar is in
full swing
The way Maple Sugar is made is very interesting
In the springtime before the trees begin to bud and blossom the sap
rises and works its way up into every bough and branch and twig of the
tree Sap is a liquid which flows through the tree much in the same way
that blood flows through our veins and the sap is the lifegiving element
of the tree just as the blood is of the body
In the maple tree this sap is sweet and it is from the sap that the Maple
Sugar is made
To obtain it the tree is tapped by being bored with an augur The sap
flows through the hole thus made and is caught in vessels placed for the
purpose
When the tree has yielded a certain amount of sap the holes are plugged
and then covered with wax to stop the sap from flowing If this were not
done it would continue to flow until every drop was exhausted and the
tree would practically bleed to death
Maple trees are only tapped once in two years so that they may have time
to recover from the loss of sap and thrive and grow into fine healthy
trees for the tapping of the trees by no means kills them There are some
maples in New York State that have been producing sugar for nearly one
hundred years and show no sign of decay though they are still tapped
when their season comes round
When the sap has been drawn from the tree it is generally boiled down
until it crystallizes or sugars it is then poured into moulds and
hardens this is the favorite way among the farmers for keeping Maple
Sugar
In former times no woman took part in the maplesugar manufacture The men
used first to tap the trees and then boil the sap over wood fires that
they would build in the neighborhood of the sugar bush as the maple grove
is called
The men used iron kettles to boil the sugar and did not take as much care
as they might have done to see that the kettle was not rusty or that no
twigs or leaves fell in and so a boiling of sugar sometimes would be
spoiled
Nowadays the women go along to the sugaring with the men The boiling is
done under cover and it is the duty of the women to see that the kettles
are properly cleaned and scoured As the men do not have to divide their
attention between boiling the sugar and gathering the sap and both
processes are in the charge of special people the result is that the
sugar is much better
If you ever have a chance to go to a sugar camp go It is great fun
Shortly before the syrup sugars the boys and girls pour it on ice or snow
or into cold water this hardens it so that it can be held in the fingers
like candy The process is called waxing sugar

INVENTION AND DISCOVERY
A NEW INKSTAND has lately been patented
The great trouble we all have with our ink is that it thickens so quickly
if we are not very careful to cover the inkstand after using
The new inkwell to save this trouble is selfclosing
Illustration
One lid of the well is made in the shape of a half circle and is fitted
into a groove made to receive it
When a person wishes to dip the pen in the ink the touch of the pen
slides the curved lid back and then directly the pen is drawn out the
lid slides back into place again and the ink is protected
NEW FLOWERPOTTo people who really love flowers the new
flowerpot holder should prove a very great treasure
It is to be made in china and very prettily decorated and its novelty
consists in the plan of making it with an upper and lower chamber
The upper part holds the flowerpot and the lower collects the water that
trickles through the pot and keeps it away from the roots of the flower
thus preventing the plant from standing in water and rotting
Illustration
The upper and lower portions are connected by a perforated grating
through which the water is carried off

LETTERS FROM OUR YOUNG FRIENDS
We have to acknowledge a great number of letters this week so many
indeed that want of space prevents publishing them all
From the Dartmouth Street School Worcester we have three letters
Etta H Annie H and Roy R have sent us delightful little notes
telling us how much they enjoy THE GREAT ROUND WORLD
We must congratulate all three of our young friends on their excellent
writing They are among the best written letters we have received so far
Ettas is particularly clear and good
Frederic D writes a second letter asking about Crusoes Island
We have heard nothing new about Juan Fernandez
We have however written to the Consul at Valparaiso and asked him if he
can give us any information
We cannot get an answer for several weeks but when we do all our doubts
about Crusoes Island will be set at rest
We thank Swift T of Yonkers for his very kind and friendly letter It
pleases us very much to know that our young friends like the paper and are
anxious to receive it every week
DEAR EDITOR
I want to say how glad I was when I heard from THE GREAT
ROUND WORLD that General Gomez had won a victory I wish
that that brutal General Weyler had been killed instead of
General Maceo Wasnt it extraordinary that all the trees in
India were covered with that queer stuff I wonder how it got
there Have any of the Hindustanees risen yet
I am also very interested in the war Greece is having with
Turkey I wish the powers would not interfere with Greece and
Turkey but let them fight it out
Your picture of a statue of King Arthur has a shield We have a
photograph of a statue in a tomb at Innsbruck but it has no
shield Did Fischer make two statues
I wish THE GREAT ROUND WORLD were published twice a
week
Yours very truly

DEAR YOUNG FRIEND
The original statue of King Arthur had no shield though it was evidently
intended that it should have one Some years ago an appropriate shield was
made for it The photographs are sometimes with it and sometimes without
it though as the statue stands now in the church it is with the shield as
illustrated in THE GREAT ROUND WORLD
We have heard of no fresh rising in India the plague and the famine are
weakening the people so much that they have little spirit of revolt left
EDITOR
We are gratified to print the following letter
