1 Esdr 11
And Josias held the feast of the passover in Jerusalem unto his Lord
and offered the passover the fourteenth day of the first month
1 Esdr 12
Having set the priests according to their daily courses being arrayed
in long garments in the temple of the Lord
1 Esdr 13
And he spake unto the Levites the holy ministers of Israel that they
should hallow themselves unto the Lord to set the holy ark of the
Lord in the house that king Solomon the son of David had built
1 Esdr 14
And said Ye shall no more bear the ark upon your shoulders now
therefore serve the Lord your God and minister unto his people
Israel and prepare you after your families and kindreds
1 Esdr 15
According as David the king of Israel prescribed and according to
the magnificence of Solomon his son and standing in the temple
according to the several dignity of the families of you the Levites
who minister in the presence of your brethren the children of Israel
1 Esdr 16
Offer the passover in order and make ready the sacrifices for your
brethren and keep the passover according to the commandment of the
Lord which was given unto Moses
1 Esdr 17
And unto the people that was found there Josias gave thirty thousand
lambs and kids and three thousand calves these things were given
of the kings allowance according as he promised to the people
to the priests and to the Levites
1 Esdr 18
And Helkias Zacharias and Syelus the governors of the temple gave
to the priests for the passover two thousand and six hundred sheep
and three hundred calves
1 Esdr 19
And Jeconias and Samaias and Nathanael his brother and Assabias
and Ochiel and Joram captains over thousands gave to the Levites
for the passover five thousand sheep and seven hundred calves
1 Esdr 110
And when these things were done the priests and Levites having the
unleavened bread stood in very comely order according to the kindreds
1 Esdr 111
And according to the several dignities of the fathers before the
people to offer to the Lord as it is written in the book of Moses
and thus did they in the morning
1 Esdr 112
And they roasted the passover with fire as appertaineth as for the
sacrifices they sod them in brass pots and pans with a good savour
1 Esdr 113
And set them before all the people and afterward they prepared for
themselves and for the priests their brethren the sons of Aaron
1 Esdr 114
For the priests offered the fat until night and the Levites prepared
for themselves and the priests their brethren the sons of Aaron
1 Esdr 115
The holy singers also the sons of Asaph were in their order according
to the appointment of David to wit Asaph Zacharias and Jeduthun
who was of the kings retinue
1 Esdr 116
Moreover the porters were at every gate it was not lawful for any to
go from his ordinary service for their brethren the Levites prepared
for them
1 Esdr 117
Thus were the things that belonged to the sacrifices of the Lord
accomplished in that day that they might hold the passover
1 Esdr 118
And offer sacrifices upon the altar of the Lord according to the
commandment of king Josias
1 Esdr 119
So the children of Israel which were present held the passover at
that time and the feast of sweet bread seven days
1 Esdr 120
And such a passover was not kept in Israel since the time of the
prophet Samuel
1 Esdr 121
Yea all the kings of Israel held not such a passover as Josias and
the priests and the Levites and the Jews held with all Israel
that were found dwelling at Jerusalem
1 Esdr 122
In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josias was this passover kept
1 Esdr 123
And the works or Josias were upright before his Lord with an heart
full of godliness
1 Esdr 124
As for the things that came to pass in his time they were written
in former times concerning those that sinned and did wickedly against
the Lord above all people and kingdoms and how they grieved him
exceedingly so that the words of the Lord rose up against Israel
1 Esdr 125
Now after all these acts of Josias it came to pass that Pharaoh
the king of Egypt came to raise war at Carchamis upon Euphrates
and Josias went out against him
1 Esdr 126
But the king of Egypt sent to him saying What have I to do with
thee O king of Judea
1 Esdr 127
I am not sent out from the Lord God against thee for my war is upon
Euphrates and now the Lord is with me yea the Lord is with me
hasting me forward depart from me and be not against the Lord
1 Esdr 128
Howbeit Josias did not turn back his chariot from him but undertook
to fight with him not regarding the words of the prophet Jeremy
spoken by the mouth of the Lord
1 Esdr 129
But joined battle with him in the plain of Magiddo and the princes
came against king Josias
1 Esdr 130
Then said the king unto his servants Carry me away out of the battle
for I am very weak And immediately his servants took him away out
of the battle
1 Esdr 131
Then gat he up upon his second chariot and being brought back to
Jerusalem died and was buried in his fathers sepulchre
1 Esdr 132
And in all Jewry they mourned for Josias yea Jeremy the prophet
lamented for Josias and the chief men with the women made lamentation
for him unto this day and this was given out for an ordinance
to be done continually in all the nation of Israel
1 Esdr 133
These things are written in the book of the stories of the kings of
Judah and every one of the acts that Josias did and his glory
and his understanding in the law of the Lord and the things that
he had done before and the things now recited are reported in
the book of the kings of Israel and Judea
1 Esdr 134
And the people took Joachaz the son of Josias and made him king
instead of Josias his father when he was twenty and three years old
1 Esdr 135
And he reigned in Judea and in Jerusalem three months and then the
king of Egypt deposed him from reigning in Jerusalem
1 Esdr 136
And he set a tax upon the land of an hundred talents of silver and
one talent of gold
1 Esdr 137
The king of Egypt also made king Joacim his brother king of Judea
and Jerusalem
1 Esdr 138
And he bound Joacim and the nobles but Zaraces his brother he
apprehended and brought him out of Egypt
1 Esdr 139
Five and twenty years old was Joacim when he was made king in the land
of Judea and Jerusalem and he did evil before the Lord
1 Esdr 140
Wherefore against him Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came up
and bound him with a chain of brass and carried him into Babylon
1 Esdr 141
Nabuchodonosor also took of the holy vessels of the Lord and carried
them away and set them in his own temple at Babylon
1 Esdr 142
But those things that are recorded of him and of his uncleaness and
impiety are written in the chronicles of the kings
1 Esdr 143
And Joacim his son reigned in his stead he was made king being
eighteen years old
1 Esdr 144
And reigned but three months and ten days in Jerusalem and did
evil before the Lord
1 Esdr 145
So after a year Nabuchodonosor sent and caused him to be brought into
Babylon with the holy vessels of the Lord
1 Esdr 146
And made Zedechias king of Judea and Jerusalem when he was one and
twenty years old and he reigned eleven years
1 Esdr 147
And he did evil also in the sight of the Lord and cared not for the
words that were spoken unto him by the prophet Jeremy from the mouth
of the Lord
1 Esdr 148
And after that king Nabuchodonosor had made him to swear by the name
of the Lord he forswore himself and rebelled and hardening his neck
his heart he transgressed the laws of the Lord God of Israel
1 Esdr 149
The governors also of the people and of the priests did many things
against the laws and passed all the pollutions of all nations
and defiled the temple of the Lord which was sanctified in Jerusalem
1 Esdr 150
Nevertheless the God of their fathers sent by his messenger to call
them back because he spared them and his tabernacle also
1 Esdr 151
But they had his messengers in derision and look when the Lord
spake unto them they made a sport of his prophets
1 Esdr 152
So far forth that he being wroth with his people for their great
ungodliness commanded the kings of the Chaldees to come up against them
1 Esdr 153
Who slew their young men with the sword yea even within the compass
of their holy temple and spared neither young man nor maid old man
nor child among them for he delivered all into their hands
1 Esdr 154
And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord both great and small
with the vessels of the ark of God and the kings treasures and
carried them away into Babylon
1 Esdr 155
As for the house of the Lord they burnt it and brake down the walls
of Jerusalem and set fire upon her towers
1 Esdr 156
And as for her glorious things they never ceased till they had consumed
and brought them all to nought and the people that were not slain with
the sword he carried unto Babylon
1 Esdr 157
Who became servants to him and his children till the Persians reigned
to fulfil the word of the Lord spoken by the mouth of Jeremy
1 Esdr 158
Until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths the whole time of her
desolation shall she rest until the full term of seventy years
1 Esdr 21
In the first year of Cyrus king of the Persians that the word of the
Lord might be accomplished that he had promised by the mouth of Jeremy
1 Esdr 22
The Lord raised up the spirit of Cyrus the king of the Persians and
he made proclamation through all his kingdom and also by writing
1 Esdr 23
Saying Thus saith Cyrus king of the Persians The Lord of Israel the
most high Lord hath made me king of the whole world
1 Esdr 24
And commanded me to build him an house at Jerusalem in Jewry
1 Esdr 25
If therefore there be any of you that are of his people let the Lord
even his Lord be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem that is in
Judea and build the house of the Lord of Israel for he is the Lord
that dwelleth in Jerusalem
1 Esdr 26
Whosoever then dwell in the places about let them help him those I
say that are his neighbours with gold and with silver
1 Esdr 27
With gifts with horses and with cattle and other things which have
been set forth by vow for the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem
1 Esdr 28
Then the chief of the families of Judea and of the tribe of Benjamin
stood up the priests also and the Levites and all they whose mind
the Lord had moved to go up and to build an house for the Lord at
Jerusalem
1 Esdr 29
And they that dwelt round about them and helped them in all things
with silver and gold with horses and cattle and with very many free
gifts of a great number whose minds were stirred up thereto
1 Esdr 210
King Cyrus also brought forth the holy vessels which Nabuchodonosor
had carried away from Jerusalem and had set up in his temple of idols
1 Esdr 211
Now when Cyrus king of the Persians had brought them forth he
delivered them to Mithridates his treasurer
1 Esdr 212
And by him they were delivered to Sanabassar the governor of Judea
1 Esdr 213
And this was the number of them A thousand golden cups and a thousand
of silver censers of silver twenty nine vials of gold thirty and of
silver two thousand four hundred and ten and a thousand other vessels
1 Esdr 214
So all the vessels of gold and of silver which were carried away
were five thousand four hundred threescore and nine
1 Esdr 215
These were brought back by Sanabassar together with them of the
captivity from Babylon to Jerusalem
1 Esdr 216
But in the time of Artexerxes king of the Persians Belemus and
Mithridates and Tabellius and Rathumus and Beeltethmus and
Semellius the secretary with others that were in commission
with them dwelling in Samaria and other places wrote unto him
against them that dwelt in Judea and Jerusalem these letters
following
1 Esdr 217
To king Artexerxes our lord Thy servants Rathumus the storywriter
and Semellius the scribe and the rest of their council and the
judges that are in Celosyria and Phenice
1 Esdr 218
Be it now known to the lord king that the Jews that are up from you
to us being come into Jerusalem that rebellious and wicked city
do build the marketplaces and repair the walls of it and do lay
the foundation of the temple
1 Esdr 219
Now if this city and the walls thereof be made up again they will
not only refuse to give tribute but also rebel against kings
1 Esdr 220
And forasmuch as the things pertaining to the temple are now
in hand we think it meet not to neglect such a matter
1 Esdr 221
But to speak unto our lord the king to the intent that if
it be thy pleasure it may be sought out in the books of thy
fathers
1 Esdr 222
And thou shalt find in the chronicles what is written concerning
these things and shalt understand that that city was rebellious
troubling both kings and cities
1 Esdr 223
And that the Jews were rebellious and raised always wars therein
for the which cause even this city was made desolate
1 Esdr 224
Wherefore now we do declare unto thee O lord the king that
if this city be built again and the walls thereof set up anew
thou shalt from henceforth have no passage into Celosyria and
Phenice
1 Esdr 225
Then the king wrote back again to Rathumus the storywriter
to Beeltethmus to Semellius the scribe and to the rest that
were in commission and dwellers in Samaria and Syria and
Phenice after this manner
1 Esdr 226
I have read the epistle which ye have sent unto me therefore
I commanded to make diligent search and it hath been found that
that city was from the beginning practising against kings
1 Esdr 227
And the men therein were given to rebellion and war and that
mighty kings and fierce were in Jerusalem who reigned and exacted
tributes in Celosyria and Phenice
1 Esdr 228
Now therefore I have commanded to hinder those men from building the
city and heed to be taken that there be no more done in it
1 Esdr 229
And that those wicked workers proceed no further to the annoyance
of kings
1 Esdr 230
Then king Artexerxes his letters being read Rathumus and Semellius
the scribe and the rest that were in commission with them removing
in haste toward Jerusalem with a troop of horsemen and a multitude of
people in battle array began to hinder the builders and the building
of the temple in Jerusalem ceased until the second year of the reign
of Darius king of the Persians
1 Esdr 31
Now when Darius reigned he made a great feast unto all his subjects
and unto all his household and unto all the princes of Media and
Persia
1 Esdr 32
And to all the governors and captains and lieutenants that were under
him from India unto Ethiopia of an hundred twenty and seven provinces
1 Esdr 33
And when they had eaten and drunken and being satisfied were gone
home then Darius the king went into his bedchamber and slept and
soon after awaked
1 Esdr 34
Then three young men that were of the guard that kept the kings
body spake one to another
1 Esdr 35
Let every one of us speak a sentence he that shall overcome and
whose sentence shall seem wiser than the others unto him shall the
king Darius give great gifts and great things in token of victory
1 Esdr 36
As to be clothed in purple to drink in gold and to sleep upon
gold and a chariot with bridles of gold and an headtire of fine
linen and a chain about his neck
1 Esdr 37
And he shall sit next to Darius because of his wisdom and shall be
called Darius his cousin
1 Esdr 38
And then every one wrote his sentence sealed it and laid it
under king Darius his pillow
1 Esdr 39
And said that when the king is risen some will give him the
writings and of whose side the king and the three princes of
Persia shall judge that his sentence is the wisest to him shall
the victory be given as was appointed
1 Esdr 310
The first wrote Wine is the strongest
1 Esdr 311
The second wrote The king is strongest
1 Esdr 312
The third wrote Women are strongest but above all things Truth
beareth away the victory
1 Esdr 313
Now when the king was risen up they took their writings and
delivered them unto him and so he read them
1 Esdr 314
And sending forth he called all the princes of Persia and Media
and the governors and the captains and the lieutenants
and the chief officers
1 Esdr 315
And sat him down in the royal seat of judgment and the writings
were read before them
1 Esdr 316
And he said Call the young men and they shall declare their
own sentences So they were called and came in
1 Esdr 317
And he said unto them Declare unto us your mind concerning the
writings Then began the first who had spoken of the strength of
wine
1 Esdr 318
And he said thus O ye men how exceeding strong is wine it causeth
all men to err that drink it
1 Esdr 319
It maketh the mind of the king and of the fatherless child to be
all one of the bondman and of the freeman of the poor man and of
the rich
1 Esdr 320
It turneth also every thought into jollity and mirth so that a man
remembereth neither sorrow nor debt
1 Esdr 321
And it maketh every heart rich so that a man remembereth neither
king nor governor and it maketh to speak all things by talents
1 Esdr 322
And when they are in their cups they forget their love both to
friends and brethren and a little after draw out swords
1 Esdr 323
But when they are from the wine they remember not what they have done
1 Esdr 324
O ye men is not wine the strongest that enforceth to do thus And
when he had so spoken he held his peace
1 Esdr 41
Then the second that had spoken of the strength of the king began
to say
1 Esdr 42
O ye men do not men excel in strength that bear rule over sea and
land and all things in them
1 Esdr 43
But yet the king is more mighty for he is lord of all these things
and hath dominion over them and whatsoever he commandeth them they do
1 Esdr 44
If he bid them make war the one against the other they do it if he
send them out against the enemies they go and break down mountains
walls and towers
1 Esdr 45
They slay and are slain and transgress not the kings commandment
if they get the victory they bring all to the king as well the spoil
as all things else
1 Esdr 46
Likewise for those that are no soldiers and have not to do
with wars but use husbundry when they have reaped again that
which they had sown they bring it to the king and compel one
another to pay tribute unto the king
1 Esdr 47
And yet he is but one man if he command to kill they kill
if he command to spare they spare
1 Esdr 48
If he command to smite they smite if he command to make desolate
they make desolate if he command to build they build
1 Esdr 49
If he command to cut down they cut down if he command to plant
they plant
1 Esdr 410
So all his people and his armies obey him furthermore he lieth down
he eateth and drinketh and taketh his rest
1 Esdr 411
And these keep watch round about him neither may any one depart and
do his own business neither disobey they him in any thing
1 Esdr 412
O ye men how should not the king be mightiest when in such sort
he is obeyed And he held his tongue
1 Esdr 413
Then the third who had spoken of women and of the truth this was
Zorobabel began to speak
1 Esdr 414
O ye men it is not the great king nor the multitude of men
neither is it wine that excelleth who is it then that ruleth
them or hath the lordship over them are they not women
1 Esdr 415
Women have borne the king and all the people that bear rule by sea
and land
1 Esdr 416
Even of them came they and they nourished them up that planted the
vineyards from whence the wine cometh
1 Esdr 417
These also make garments for men these bring glory unto men
and without women cannot men be
1 Esdr 418
Yea and if men have gathered together gold and silver or any other
goodly thing do they not love a woman which is comely in favour
and beauty
1 Esdr 419
And letting all those things go do they not gape and even
with open mouth fix their eyes fast on her and have not all men
more desire unto her than unto silver or gold or any goodly
thing whatsoever
1 Esdr 420
A man leaveth his own father that brought him up and his own
country and cleaveth unto his wife
1 Esdr 421
He sticketh not to spend his life with his wife and remembereth
neither father nor mother nor country
1 Esdr 422
By this also ye must know that women have dominion over you
do ye not labour and toil and give and bring all to the woman
1 Esdr 423
