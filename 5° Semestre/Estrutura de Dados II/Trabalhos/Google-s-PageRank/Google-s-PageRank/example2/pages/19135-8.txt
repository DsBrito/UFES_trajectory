I
Tom seated himself at the table and looked into his wifes face with a
smile
Nancy its a meal fit for a king
The supper over he smoked his pipe before the cabin fire of blazing
logs while she cleared the wooden dishes He watched her get the paper
goosequill pen and ink as a prisoner sees the scaffold building for his
execution
Now were all ready she said cheerfully
The man laid his pipe down with a helpless look A brief respite flashed
through his mind Maybe he could sidestep the lessons before she pinned
him down
Lord Nancy I forgot my gun I must grease her right away he cried
He rose with a quick decisive movement and took his rifle from the rack
She knew it was useless to protest and let him have his way
Over every inch of its heavy barrel and polished walnut stock he rubbed
a piece of greased linen with loving care drew back the flintlock and
greased carefully every nook and turn of its mechanism lifted the gun
finally to his shoulder and drew an imaginary bead on the head of a
turkey gobbler two hundred yards away A glowing coal of hickory wood in
the fire served for his game
He lowered the gun and held it before him with pride
Nancy shes the dandiest piece o iron that wuz ever twisted inter the
shape of a weepon Old Speakeasys her name Shes got the softest
voice that ever whispered death to a varmint or an Injunhit aint much
loudern the crack of a whip but man alive when she talks she says
somethin Kerpeow she whispers soft an low Shes got a voice like
yourn Nancykinder sighs when she speaks
Well the wife broke in with a shake of her dark head has mothers
little boy played long enough with his toy
I reckon so Tom laughed
Then its time for school She gently took the rifle from his hands
placed it on the buck horns and took her seat at the table
The man looked ruefully at the stool suddenly straightened his massive
frame lifted his hand above his head and cocked his eye inquiringly
May I git er drink er water fust
The teacher laughed in spite of herself
Yes you big lubber and hurry up
Tom seized the water bucket and started for the door
Where are you going she cried in dismay
Ill jest run down to the spring fer a fresh bucket
O Tom she exclaimed
Ill be right back in a minute Honey he protested softly Hits
goin ter be powerful hotIll need a whole bucket time Im through
Before she could answer he was gone
He managed to stay nearly a half hour She put the baby to sleep and sat
waiting with her pensive young eyes gazing at the leaping flames She
heard him stop and answer the call of an owl from the woods A
whippoorwill was softly singing from the bushes nearby He stopped to
call him also and then found an excuse to linger ten minutes more
fooling with his dogs
The laggard came at last and dropped on his stool by her side He sat
for five minutes staring helplessly at the copy she had set Big beads
of perspiration stood on his forehead when he took the pen He held it
awkwardly and timidly as if it were a live reptile She took his clumsy
hand in hers and showed him how to hold it
My but yo hands soft an sweet Nancyjest lemme hold that a
while
She rapped his knuckles
All right teacher Ill be good he protested and bent his huge
shoulders low over his task He bore so hard on the frail quill pen the
ink ran in a big blot
Not so hard Tom she cried
But I got so much strenk in my right arm I jist cant hold it back
You must try again
He tried again and made a heavy tremulous line His arm moved at a
snails gait and wobbled frightfully
Make the line quicker she urged encouragingly Begin at the top and
come down
Here you show me how
She took his rough hand quietly in hers and guided it swiftly from
right to left in straight smooth lines until a dozen were made when he
suddenly drew her close kissed her lips and held the slender fingers
in a grip of iron She lay still in his embrace for a moment released
herself and turned from him with a sigh He drew her quickly to the
light of the fire and saw the unshed tears in her eyes
Whats the use ter worry Nancy gal he said Give it up ez a bad
job I wouldnt fool with no sech scholar ef I wuz you Ye cant teach
an old dog new tricks
I wont give up she cried with sudden energy I can teach you and I
will I wont give up and be nobody O Tom you promised me before we
were married to let me teach youdidnt you promise
Yes Honey I did he paused and his fine teeth gleamed through the
black beardbut ye know a fellerll promise any thing ter git his
gal
Didnt you mean to keep your word She broke in sharply
Of course I did Nancy I never wuz more earnest in my lifeceptin
when I got religion But I had no idee larnin come so hard Id ruther
fight Injuns an wil cats or rob a bee tree any day than ter tackle
them pot hooks youre sickin after me
Well I wont give up she interrupted impatiently and youd just as
well make up your mind to stick to it You can do what other men have
done Youre good honest and true youre kindhearted and popular
Theyve already made you the road supervisor of this township Learn to
read and write and you can make a good speech and go to the
Legislature
Ah Nancy what do ye want me ter do that fur anyhow gal Id be the
happiest man in the world right here in this cabin by the woods ef youd
jest be happy with me Cant ye quit hankerin after them things
Honey
She shook her dark head firmly
You know Nancy we wuz neighbors to Danl Boone We thought he wuz
about the biggest man that ever lived Somehow the love o the woods an
fields is always singin in my heart Them still shinin stars up in the
sky out thar tonight keep a callin me I could hear the music o my
hounds in my soul ez I stood by the spring a while ago Ye know what
scares me most ter death sometimes gal He paused and looked into her
eyes intently
No what she asked
That youll make a carpenter outen me yit ef I dont mind
Again a smile broke through the cloud in her eyes I dont think
theres much danger of that Tom
Yes ther is too he laughed Ye see I love you so and try ter make
ye happy an ef there wuz ter come er time that there wuz plenty o
work an real money in it Id stick to it jist ter please you an be a
lost an ruined soul Yessir theyd carve on my headstone jest one
line
BORN A MANAND DIED A JACKLEG CARPENTER
Wouldnt that be awful
The momentary smile on the womans sensitive face faded into a look of
pain She tried to make a goodnatured reply but her lips refused to
move
The man pressed on eagerly
O Nancy why cant ye be happy here Weve a snug little cabin nest
weve enough to eat and enough to wear The babys laughin at yer heels
all day and snugglin in her little bed at night The birds make music
fur ye in the trees The creek down thars laughin an singing winter
an summer The worlds too purty an lifes too short ter throw hit
away fightin an scramblin fur nothin
For somethingTomsomething big
Dont keer how big tiswhat of it All turns ter ashes in yer hands
bye an bye an yer lifes gone We cant live these young days over
again can we Ye know the preacher says What shall hit profit a man
ef he gain the whole world an lose his life Let me offn these
lessons Honey Im too old ye cant larn me new tricks now Let me off
fer good an all wont ye
No was the firm answer It means too much I wont give up and let
the man I love sign his name forever with a cross mark
I aint goin ter sign no more papers nohow Tom broke in
I signed our marriage bond with a mark Tom she went on evenly just
because you couldnt write your name Youve got to learn I wont give
up
Well its too late tonight fur any more lessons now aint it
Yes well make up for it next time
The tired hunter was soon sound asleep dreaming of the life that was the
breath of his nostrils
Through the still winters night the young wife lay with wide staring
eyes Over and over again she weighed her chances in the grim struggle
begun for the mastery of his mind The longer she asked herself the
question of success or failure the more doubtful seemed the outcome How
still the world
The new life within her strong young body suddenly stirred and a
feeling of awe thrilled her heart God had suddenly signalled from the
shores of Eternity
When her husband waked at dawn he stared at her smiling face in
surprise
What ye laughin about Nancy he cried
She turned toward him with a startled look
I had a vision Tom
A dream I reckon
God had answered the prayer of my heart she went on breathlessly
and sent me a son I saw him a strong brave patient wise gentle
man Thousands hung on his words and great men came to do him homage
With bowed head he led me into a beautiful home that had shining white
pillars He bowed low and whispered in my ear This is yours my angel
mother I bought it for you with my life All that I am I owe to you
She paused a moment and whispered
O Tom man a new song is singing in my soul
II
The woman rose quietly and went the rounds of her daily work She made
her bed today in trancelike silence It was no gilded couch but it
had been built by the hand of her lover and was sacred It filled the
space in one corner of the cabin farthest from the fire A single post
of straight cedar securely fixed in the ground held the poles in place
which formed the side and foot rail The walls of the cabin formed the
other side and head Across from the pole were fixed the slender hickory
sticks that formed the springy hammock on which the first mattress of
moss and grass rested On this was placed a feather bed made from the
wild fowl Tom had killed during the past two years The pillows were of
the finest feathers from the breasts of ducks A single quilt of ample
size covered all and over this was thrown a huge counterpane of bear
skins Two enormous bear rugs almost completely covered the dirt floor
and a carpet of oak leaves filled out the spaces
The feather bed beaten smooth the fur covering drawn in place and the
pillows set upright against the cabin wall she turned to the two bunks
in the opposite corner and carefully rearranged them They might be
used soon This was the corner of her home set aside for guests Tom had
skillfully built two berths boat fashion one above the other in this
corner and a curtain drawn over a smooth wooden rod cut this space off
from the rest of the room when occupied at night by visitors
The master of this cabin never allowed a stranger to pass without urging
him to stop and in a way that took no denial
A savory dish of stewed squirrel and corn dumplings served for lunch
The babys face was one glorious smear of joy and grease at its finish
The mother took the bucket from its shelf and walked leisurely to the
spring whose limpid waters gushed from a rock at the foot of the hill
The child toddled after her the little moccasined feet stepping
gingerly over the sharp gravel of the rough places
Before filling the bucket she listened again for the crack of Toms
rifle and could hear nothing A deathlike stillness brooded over the
woods and fields He was probably watching for muskrat under the bluff
of the creek He had promised to stay within call today
The afternoon dragged wearily She tried to read the one book she
possessed the Bible The pages seemed to fade and the eyes refused to
see
O Man Man why dont you come home she cried at last
She rose walked to the door looked and listenedonly the distant
rattle of a woodpeckers beak on a dead tree in the woods The snow
began to fall in little fitful dabs It was two miles to the nearest
cabin and her soul rose in fierce rebellion at her loneliness It was
easy for a man who loved the woods the fields and running waters this
life but for the woman who must wait and long and eat her heart out
aloneshe vowed anew that she would not endure it By the sheer pull of
her will she would lift this man from his drifting life and make him
take his place in the real battle of the world If her new baby were
only a boy he could help her and she would win Again she stood
dreaming of the vision she had seen at dawn
The dark young face suddenly went white and her hand gripped the facing
of the door
She waited half doubting half amused at her fears It was only the
twinge of a muscle perhaps She smiled at her sudden panic The thought
had scarcely formed before she blanched the second time and the firm
lips came together with sudden energy as she glanced at the child
playing on the rug at her feet
She seized the horn that hung beside the door and blew the pioneers
long call of danger Its shrill note rang through the woods against the
hills in cadences that seemed half muffled by the falling snow
Again her anxious eyes looked from the doorway Would he never come The
trembling slender hand once more lifted the horn a single wild note
rang out and broke suddenly into silence The horn fell from her limp
grasp and she lifted her eyes to the darkening sky in prayer as Toms
voice from the edge of the woods came strong and full
Yes Honey Im comin
There was no question of doctor or nurse The young pioneer mother only
asked for her mate
For two fearful hours she gripped his rough hands until at last her
nails brought the blood but the man didnt know or care Every
smothered cry that came from her lips began to tear the heart out of his
body at last He could hold the long pent agony no longer without words
My God Nancy what can I do for ye Honey
Her breath came in gasps and her eyes were shining with a strange
intensity
Nothing Tom nothing nowIm looking Death in the face and Im not
afraid
Please lemme give ye some whiskey he pleaded pressing the glass to
her lips
Nono take it awayI hate it My baby shall be clean and strong or I
want to die
The decision seemed to brace her spirit for the last test when the
trembling feet entered the shadows of the dim valley that lies between
Life and Death
The dark slender figure lay still and white at last A sharp cry from
lusty lungs and the grey eyes slowly opened with a timid wondering
look
Tom she cried with quick eager tones
Yes Nancy yes
A boy
Of courseand a buster he is too
Give him to mequick
The stalwart figure bent over the bed and laid the little red bundle in
her arms She pressed him tenderly to her heart felt his breath on her
breast and the joyous tears slowly poured down her cheeks
III
Before the first year of the boys life had passed the task of teaching
his goodnatured stubborn father became impossible The best the wife
could do was to make him trace his name in sprawling letters that
resembled writing and painfully spell his way through the simplest
passages in the Bible
The day she gave up was one of dumb despair She resolved at last to
live in her boy All she had hoped and dreamed of life should be his and
he would be hers Her hands could make him good or bad brave or
cowardly noble or ignoble
He was a remarkable child physically and grew out of his clothes faster
than she could make them It was easy to see from his second year that
he would be a man of extraordinary stature Both mother and father were
above the average height but he would overtop them both When he
tumbled over the bear rugs on the cabin floor his father would roar with
laughter
For the Lords sake Nancy look at them legs Theyre windin blades
Ef he ever gits grown he wont have ter ax fer a blessin he kin jest
reach up an hand it down hisself
He was four years old when he got the first vision of his mother that
time should never blot out His father was away on a carpenter job of
four days Sleeping in the lower bunk in the corner he waked with a
start to hear the chickens cackling loudly His mother was quietly
dressing He leaped to his feet shivering in the dark and whispered
What is it Ma
Somethings after the chickens
Not a hawk
No nor an owl or fox or weaselor theyd squalltheyre cackling
The rooster cackled louder than ever and the Boy recognized the voice of
his speckled hen accompanying him How weird it sounded in the darkness
of the still spring night The cold chills ran down his back and he
caught his mothers dress as she reached for the rifle that stood beside
her bed
Youre not goin out there Ma the Boy protested
Yes Its a dirty thief after our horse
Her voice was low and steady and her hand was without tremor as she
grasped his
Get back in bed I wont be gone a minute
She left the cabin and noiselessly walked toward the low shed in which
the horse was stabled
The Boy was at her heels She knew and rejoiced in the love that made
him brave for her sake
She paused a moment listened and then lifted her tall slim form and
advanced steadily Her bare feet made no noise The waning moon was
shining with soft radiance The Boys heart was in his throat as he
watched her slender neck and head outlined against the sky Never had he
seen anything so calm and utterly brave
There was a slight noise at the stable The chickens cackled with louder
call Five minutes passed and they were silent A shadowy figure
appeared at the corner of the stable She raised the rifle and flashed a
daggerlike flame into the darkness
A smothered cry the shadow leaped the fence and the beat of swift feet
could be heard in the distance
The Boy clung close to her side and his voice was husky as he spoke
Aint you afraid Ma
The calm answer rang forever through his memory
I dont know what fear means my Boy Its not the first time Ive
caught these prowling scoundrels
Next morning he saw the dark blood marks on the trail over which the
thief had fled and looked into his mothers wistful grey eyes with a
new reverence and awe
IV
The Boy was quick to know and love the birds of hedge and field and
woods The martins that built in his gourds on the tall pole had opened
his eyes The red and bluebirds the thrush the wren the robin the
catbird and song sparrows were his daily companions
A mockingbird came at last to build her nest in a bush beside the
garden and her mate began to make the sky ring with his song The
puzzle of the feathered tribe whose habits he couldnt fathom was the
whippoorwill His mother seemed to dislike his ominous sound But the
soft mournful notes appealed to the Boys fancy Often at night he sat
in the doorway of the cabin watching the gathering shadows and the
flicker of the fire when supper was cooking listening to the tireless
song within a few feet of the house
Why dont you like em Ma he asked while one was singing with
unusually deep and haunting voice so near the cabin that its echo seemed
to come from the chimney jamb
It was some time before she replied
They say its a sign of death for them to come so close to the house
The Boy laughed
You dont believe it
I dont know
Well I like em he stoutly declared I like to feel the cold
shivers when they sing right under my feet Youre not afraid of a
little whippoorwill
He looked up into her sombre face with a smile
No was the gentle answer but I want to live to see my Boy a fine
strong man she paused stooped and drew him into her arms
There was something in her tones that brought a lump into his throat
The moon was shining in the full white glory of the Southern spring A
night of marvellous beauty enfolded the little cabin He looked into her
eyes and they were shining with tears
Whats the matter he asked tenderly
Nothing Boy Im just dreaming of you
The first day of the fall in his sixth year he asked his mother to let
him go to the next cornshucking
Youre too little a boy
I can shuck corn he stoutly argued
Youll be good if I let you go she asked
Whats to hurt me there
Nothing unless you let it The men drink whiskey the girls dance
Sometimes theres a quarrel or fight
It wont hurt me ef I tend to my own business will it
Nothing will ever hurt you if youll just do that Boy the father
broke in
May I go
Yes were invited next week to a quilting and cornshucking Ill go
with you
The Boy shouted for joy and counted the days until the wonderful event
They left home at two oclock in the wagon The quilting began at three
the cornshucking at sundown
The house was a marvellous structure to the Boys excited imagination
It was the first home he had ever seen not built of logs
Why Ma he cried in openeyed wonder there aint no logs in the
house How did they ever put it together
With bricks and mortar
The Boy couldnt keep his eyes off this building It was a simple
onestory square structure of four rooms and an attic with little
dormer windows peeping from the four sides of the pointed roof
McDonald the thrifty ScotchIrishman from the old world had built it
of bricks he had ground and burnt on his own place
The dormer windows peeping from the roof caught the Boys fancy
Do you reckon his boys sleep up there and peep out of them holes
The mother smiled
Maybe so
Why dont we build a house like that he asked at last Dont you
want it
The mother squeezed his little hand
When youre a man will you build your mother one
He looked into her eyes a moment caught the pensive longing and
answered
Yes I will
She stooped and kissed the firm mouth and was about to lead him into the
large workroom where the women were gathering around the quilts
stretched on their frames when a negro slave suddenly appeared to take
her horse to the stable He was fat jolly and coal black His yellow
teeth gleamed in their blue gums with a jovial welcome
The Boy stood rooted to the spot and watched until the negro
disappeared It was the first black man he had ever seen He had heard
of negroes and that they were slaves But he had no idea that one human
being could be so different from another
In breathless awe he asked
Is he folks
Of course Boy his mother answered smiling
What made him so black
The sun in Africa
What made his nose so flat and his lips so thick
He was born that way
What made him come here
He didnt The slave traders put him in chains and brought him across
the sea and sold him into slavery
The little body suddenly stiffened
Why didnt he kill em
