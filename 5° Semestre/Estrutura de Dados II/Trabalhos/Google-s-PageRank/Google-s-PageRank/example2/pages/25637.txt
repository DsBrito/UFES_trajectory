Its Mr Girtles orders  Theyve come here straight from Paris on
purpose and they are to have everything they want
The butler left the gloomy room and Mrs Thompson a stout lady who
moved only when she was obliged turned to the thin elderly housemaid
Mark my words Ann she said  Its contry to nature and itll
bring a curse
Well said the woman it cant make the house more dull than it has
been
I dont know said the cook
I never see a house before where there was no need to shut the shutters
and pull down the blinds because some ones dead
Well it is a gloomy place Ann but weve done all these years most as
we liked  One meal a day and the rest at his club and never any
company  There aint many places like that
No sighed Ann  I suppose we shall all have to go
Oh I dont know my dear  Mr Ramo says he thinks masters left all
his money to his great nephew Mr Capel and may be hell have the
house painted up and the rooms cleaned and keep lots of company  An
he may marry this Miss Dungeonaint her name
DEnghien said the housemaid spelling it slowly  I dont
know what you call it  Shes very handsome but so orty  I like Miss
Lawrence  Only to think master never seeing a soul and living all
these years in this great shutup house and then as soon as the
breaths out of his body all these relatives turning up
Where the carcase is there the eagles are gathered together said
cook solemnly
Oh dont talk like that cook
Youre not obliged to listen my dear said cook rubbing her knees
gently
I declare its been grievous to me continued the housemaid all
those beautiful rooms full of splendid furniture and one not allowed
to do more than keep em just clean  Not a blind drawn up or a window
opened  Its always been as if there was a funeral in the house  Think
master was crossed in love
No  Not he  Mr Ramo said that master was twice over married to great
Indian princesses abroad  I spose they left him all their money  Oh
here is Mr Ramo
The door had opened and a tall thin old Hindoo with piercing dark
eyes and wrinkled brown face came softly in  He was dressed in a long
dark red silken cassock that seemed as if woven in one piece and
fitted his spare form rather closely from neck to heel a white cloth
girdle was tied round his waist and for sole ornament there were a
couple of plain gold rings in his ears
As he entered he raised his thin largelyveined brown hands to his
closelycropped head half making the native salaam and then said in
good English
Mr Preenham not here
Hell be back directly Mr Ramo said the cook  There there do
sit down you look worn out
The Hindoo shook his head and walked to the window which looked out
into an inner area
At that moment the butler entered and the Hindoo turned to him quickly
and laid his hand upon his arm
There there dont fret about it Mr Ramo said the butler  Its
what we must all come tosome day
Yes but this this said the Hindoo in a low excited voice  Is
is it right
The butler was silent for a few moments
Well he said at last its right and its wrong as you may say
Its masters own orders for there it was in his own handwriting in his
desk  Instructions for my solicitor  Mr Girtle showed it me being
an old family servant
Yes yeshe showed it to me
Oh it was all there continued the butler  Well as I was saying
its right so far but its wrong because its not like a Christian
burial
No no cried the Hindoo excitedly  Those menthey make me mad  I
cannot bear it  Look he cried he should have died out in my
country where we would have laid him on sweet scented woods and
baskets of spices and gums and there where the sun shines and the palm
trees wave I his old servant would have fired the pile and he would
have risen up in the clouds of smoke and among the pure clear flames of
fire till nothing but the ashes was left  Yes yes that would have
been his end he cried with flashing eyes as he seemed to mentally
picture the scene and then thy servant could have died with thee  Oh
Sahib Sahib Sahib
He clasped his hands together the fire died from his eyes which became
suffused with tears and as he uttered the last word thrice in a low
moaning voice he stood rocking himself to and fro
The two women looked horrified and shuddered but the piteous grief was
magnetic and in the deep silence that fell they began to sob while the
butler blew his nose softly coughed and at last laid his hand upon the
old servants shoulder
Shake hands Mr Ramo he said huskily  Fifteen years you and mes
been together and if we havent hit it as we might well it was only
natural me being an Englishman and you almost a black but its this as
brings us all together natives and furreners and all  He was a good
master God bless him and Im sorry hes gone
The old Indian looked up at him half wonderingly for a few moments
Then taking the extended hand in both of his he held it for a time
and pressed it to his heart dropped it and turned to go
Wont you take something Mr Ramo
Nono said the Indian shaking his head and he glided softly out of
the servants hall went silently in his soft yellow leather slippers
down a long passage and up a flight of stone stairs to pass through a
glass door and stand in the large gloomy hall in the middle of one of
the marble squares that turned the floor into a vast chessboard round
which the giant pieces seemed to be waiting to commence the game
For the faint light that came through the thick groundglass fanlight
over the great double doors was diffused among black bronze statues and
white marble figures of Greek and Roman knights  In one place seated
meditatively with hands resting upon the knees there was an Indian
god seeming to watch the floor  In another a great Japanese warrior
while towards the bottom of the great winding staircase whose stone
steps were covered with heavy dark carpet was a marble that
imagination might easily have taken for a queen
Here and there the panelled walls were ornamented with stands of Indian
arms and armour conical helmets once worn by Eastern chiefs with
pendent curtains and suits of chain mail  Bloodthirsty daggers curved
scimitars spears clumsy matchlocks and long straight swords whose
hilt was an iron gauntlet in which the warriors fingers were laced as
they grasped a handle placed at right angles to the blade after the
fashion of a spade  There were shields too and bows and arrows and
tulwars and kukris any number of warlike implements from the East
while beside the statues the West had to show some curious chairs and
a fulllength portrait of an Englishman in the prime of lifea
handsome boldfaced man in the uniform of one of John Companys
regiments his helmet in his hand and his breast adorned with orders
and jewels of foreign make
The old Indian servant stood there like one of the statues as the
diningroom door opened and three dark closelyshaven and moustached
men in black came out softly and went silently up the stairs
There was something singularly furtive and strange about them as they
followed one another in silence all three alike in their dress coats
and turneddown white collars beneath which was a narrow strip of
ribbon knotted in front
They passed on and on up the great winding stairs past the
drawingroom from whence came the low buzz of voices to a door at the
back of the house beside a great stainedglass window whose weird
lights shone down upon a lionskin rug
Here the first man stopped for his companions to reach his side  Then
whispering a few words to them he took a key from his pocket opened
the door withdrew the key and entered the darkened room closing and
locking the door as the old Indian crept softly up sank upon his knees
upon the skin rug his hands clasped his head bent down and resting
against the panels of the door
CHAPTER TWO
THE DEAD MANS RELATIVES
I can tell you very little Mr Capel  I have been your great uncles
confidential solicitor ever since he returned from India  I was a mere
boy when he went away  He knew me then and when he came back he sought
me out
And that is twentyfive years ago Mr Girtle
Yes  The year you were born
And he made you his confidant
Yes he gave me his confidence as far as I think he gave it to any
man
And did he always live in this way
Always  He filled up the house with the vast collection of curiosities
and things that he had been sending home for years and I expected that
he would entertain and lead the life of an English gentleman but no
the house has been closed for twentyfive years
Mr Girtle a cleanshaven old gentleman with yellow face dark
restless eyes and bright grey hair took a pinch of snuff from a
handsome gold box flicked a few grains from his white shirtfront and
said Hah
Had my uncle met with any great disappointment said the first
speaker a franklooking man with closely curling brown hair and a
high white forehead
What to make him take to this strange life  Oh no  He was peculiar
but not unhappy  He liked to be alone but he was always bright and
cheerful at his club
You met him there then said a fresh voice and a handsome dark
young fellow who had been leaning back in an easy chair in the dim
drawingroom sat up quickly playing with his little black moustache
Oh yes  I used to dine with Colonel Capel when we had business to
transact
But here you say he led the life of a miser continued the young man
crossing his legs and examining the toe of his patent leather boot
I beg your pardon Mr Gerard Artis I did not say that  Your great
uncle was no miser  He spent money freely sometimes in charities
Yes he continued turning to where two ladies were seated  Colonel
Capel was often very charitable
I never saw his name in any charitable list said the darker of the
two ladies speaking in a sweet silvery voice and her beautiful
regular features seemed to attract both the previous speakers
No Miss DEnghien I suppose not said the old man nodding his head
and rising to begin walking up and down snuffbox in hand  Neither
did I  But he was very charitable in his own particular way and he was
very kind
Yes said the young man who had first spoken very kind  I have him
to thank for my school and college education
Wellyes said the old lawyer I suppose it is no breach of
confidence to say that it is so
And I have to thank him for mine and the pleasant life I have led Mr
Girtle have I not said the second of the ladies and but for the
gloom the flush that came into her sweet face would have been plainly
visible
At that moment the footman entered with a letter upon a massive salver
and as he walked straight to the old lawyer he cast quick furtive
glances at the other occupants of the room
A note eh said the old solicitor balancing his goldrimmed glasses
upon his nose umumyes exactlyvery delicate of them to write
Tell them I will see them shortly Charles
The footman bowed and was retiring as silently as he came over the soft
carpet when he was checked by the old solicitor
You will tell Mr Preenham to see that these gentlemen have every
attention
Yes sir
The footman left the room almost without a sound for the door was
opened and closed noiselessly  The only thing that broke the terrible
silence that seemed to reign was the faint clink of the silver tray
against one of the metal buttons of the mans coat  As for the
magnificently furnished room with its heavy curtains and drawndown
blinds it seemed to have grown darker so that the faint gleams of
light that had hung in a dull way on the faces of the great mirrors and
the gilded carving of console and cheffonier had died out  It required
no great effort of the imagination to believe that the influence of the
dead man who had passed so many solitary years in that shutup house was
still among them making itself felt with a weight from which they could
not free themselves
Paul Capel looked across at the beautiful face of Katrine DEnghien
thinking of her creole extraction and the half French half American
father who had married his relative  He expected to see her looking
agitated as her cousin Lydia Lawrence but she sat back with one arm
gracefully hanging over the side of the chair her lustrous eyes half
closed and a pang strongly akin to jealousy shot through him as it
seemed that those eyes were resting on the young elegant at his side
Yes said the old solicitor suddenly and his voice made all start
but Miss DEnghien who did not even move her eyelids as I was
saying he went on tapping his snuffbox I can tell you very little
Mr Capel until the will is read
Then there is a will said Miss DEnghien
The old lawyers brows wrinkled as he glanced at her in surprise
Yes my dear young lady there is a will
And it will be read of course directly after the funeral said the
dark young man
The lawyer did not reply
I suppose you think its bad form of a man asking such questions now
but really Mr Girtle it would be worse form for a fellow to be
pulling a long face about one he never saw
But he was your fathers friend
Oh yes of course
Hence you sir are here continued the lawyer  My instructions were
clear enough  I was to invite you here at this painful time and take
my old friends place as your host
You have been most kind Mr Girtle said Miss DEnghien
I thank you madam and I grieve that you should have to be present at
so painful a time  My next instructions were to send for the Italian
professor who is here to carry out the wishes of the deceased
Horrible idea for a man to wish to be embalmed said Artis brutally
Lydia Lawrence shuddered and turned away her face  Paul Capel glanced
indignantly at the speaker and then turned to gaze at Katrine
DEnghien who sat perfectly unmoved her hand still hanging from the
side of the chair as if to show the graceful contour of her arm
Colonel Capel had been a great part of his life in the East Mr
Artis said the old lawyer coldly  He had had the matter in his mind
for some time
How do you know that
By the date on my instructions which also contained the Italian
professors card
And I suppose we shall have a very eccentric will sir
Yes said the lawyer quietly a very eccentric will
Come thats refreshing said the young man with a fidgetty movement
Well you are not very communicative Mr Girtle  You family
solicitors are as close as your deed boxes
Yes said the old lawyer closing his gold snuffbox with a loud snap
Well come it can be no breach of confidence to tell us when the
funeral is to be
The old lawyer took a turn or two up and down the room snuffbox in
hand the bright metal glistening as he swung his hand to and fro  Then
he stopped short and said slowly
The successor to Colonel Capels enormous property will inherit under
extremely peculiar conditions duly set forth in the will it will be my
duty to read to you
After the funeral said Gerard Artis
No sir there will be no funeral
No funeral exclaimed Artis and Paul Capel in a breath and then they
rose to their feet startled more than they would have cared to own for
at that moment a strange wild cry seemed to come from the staircase
followed by a heavy crash
Good Heavens cried the old lawyer dropping his snuffbox
Katrine DEnghien alone remained unmoved with her head turned towards
the door
CHAPTER THREE
ONE GUARDIAN OF THE TREASURE
Paul Capel was the first to recover from the surprise and to hurry from
the darkened room followed by Artis and the late Colonels solicitor
though it was into no blaze of light for the staircase was equally
gloomy
The source of the strange noise was not far to seek for as they
reached the landing they became aware that a fierce struggle was going
on in the direction of the room occupied by the late Colonel and
hurrying there it was to find two men locked together one of whom was
succeeding in holding the other down and wresting his neck from the
sinewy hands which had torn off his white cravat
Why Charles  Ramo exclaimed Mr Girtle in the midst of the hoarse
panting sounds uttered by the contending men
Hes mad cried the former in a highpitched tone in which a mans
rage was mingled with a schoolboys whimpering fear  Hes mad sir
He tried to strangle me
Thief dog panted the old Hindoo with his dark features convulsed
with passion  Wantedrobhis master
The two young men had separated the combatants who now stood up the
footman his vest and shirt torn open and his coat dragged half off
the old man with one sleeve of his dark silk robe gone and the back
rent to the waist while there was a fierce vindictive look in his
working features as he had to be held to keep him from closing with the
footman again
What does this mean Charles cried Mr Girtle as the butler and the
other servants came hurrying up while the three Italians also stood
upon the landing looking wonderingly on
If you please sir I dont know said the footman in an illused
tone  I was just going by the Colonels door and I thought as was
very natural that I should like to see what these gentlemen had done
when Mr Ramo sprang at me like a wild cat
No no cried the old Indian whose English in his rage and excitement
was less distinct a thiefcome to robmy dear lorda thief
I hope sir said the footman growing calmer and looking in an
injured way at Mr Girtle you know me better than that sir  Mr
Preenham here will tell you Ive cleaned the plate regular all the ten
years Ive been here
The old solicitor turned to the butler
Yes sir Charless duty has been to clean the plate but it is in my
charge and I have kept the strictest account of it  A little disposed
to show temper sometimes sir but strictly honest and very clean
This is a very sad and unseemly business at such a time said Mr
Girtle  Ramo you have made a mistake
No no cried the old Indian wrathfully
Come come said Mr Girtle be reasonable
The police panted the old Indian  Send for the police
All right cried Charles defiantly send for the police and let em
search me
Silence cried Mr Girtle  Go down and arrange your dress sir  Mr
Capel young ladies will you return to the drawingroom  Signori will
you retire  That will do Preenham  Leave Ramo to me
In another minute the old solicitor was left with Ramo who stood
beneath the dim stainedglass window with his arms folded and his brow
knit
You do not trust and believe me sir
Dont talk nonsense Ramo  You know I trust you as the most faithful
fellow in the world
He held out his hand as he spoke but the old Indian remained motionless
for the moment then seizing the hand extended to him he bent over it
holding it to his breast
My dear lords old friend he said
Thats better Ramo said Mr Girtle  Now go and change your
dress
No no cried the old man  I must watch
Nonsense man  Dont think that every one who comes means to rob
But I do cried the old Indian in a whisper  They think of what we
knowyou and I only  Those foreign menthe servants
You must not be so suspicious Ramo  It will be all right
It will not be all right Sahib cried the old Indian  Think of what
there is in yonder
But we have the secret Ramo
Yesyes but suppose there were others who knew the secretwho had
heard of it  Sahib I will be faithful to the dead
The old Indian drew himself up with dignity and took his place once
more before the door
It has been shocking whispered the Indian  I have been driven away
while those foreign men did what they pleased in there  It was
maddening  Ah
He clapped his hands to his head
What now Ramo
Those three men  Suppose
He caught at his companions arm whispered a few words and they
entered the darkened room from which as the door opened and closed a
peculiar aromatic odour floated out
As the door was closed the sound of a bolt being shot inside was heard
and directly after the face of Charles the footman appeared from the
gloom below  He came up the stairs rapidly glanced round and stepped
softly to the closed door where he bent down listening
As he stood in the recess the gloom was so great that he was almost
invisible save his face while just beyond him a large group in bronze
of a clubarmed centaur seemed to have the crouching man as part of the
artists design the centaur being apparently about to strike him
down while to give realism to the scene a dull red glow from the
stainedglass window fell across his forehead
As he listened there his ear to the keyhole and his eyes watchfully
wandering up and down the staircase a dull and smothered clang was
heard as if in the distance like the closing of some heavy iron door
Then there was a louder sound with a quick short report as if a
powerful spring had been set in motion and shot home  Then a door
seemed to be closed and locked and the man glided quickly over the
soft thick carpetmelting away as it were in the gloom
The door opened and from the darkness within Mr Girtle and the old
Indian stepped slowly out bringing with them a soft warm puff of the
aromatic odour and as they grew more distinct in the faint light of
the stainedglass window everything was so still in the great house
that there was a strange unreality about them fostered by the silence
of their tread
There now you are satisfied said the old lawyer gently  Go and
change your robe
The Indian shook his head
I will stay till your return inside the room
Inside said the Indian
Yeswhy not  You and I have reached the time of life when death has
ceased to have terrors  He is only taking the sleep that comes to all
There was a gentle sadness in the lawyers voice and then turning the
handle of the door he opened it and stood looking back
You will not be long he said  They are waiting for me in the
drawingroom
The door closed just as the old Indian made a step forward to follow
Then he stood with his hands clenched and eyes starting listening
intently while the centaurs club seemed to be quivering in the gloom
ready to crush him down
The old man raised his hand to the doorlet it fallraised it again
let it fallturned to gostarted backand then as if fighting hard
with himself he turned once more and with an activity not to be
expected in one of his years bounded up the staircase and disappeared
Ten minutes had not elapsed before he seemed to come silently out of the
gloom again and was halfway to the door when there was a faint creak
from below as if from a rusty hinge
The old man stopped short crouching down by the balustrade listening
his eyes shining in the dim twilight but no other sound was heard and
he rose quickly ran softly down and with trembling hands opened the
door
Mr Girtle came slowly out looking sad and depressed and laid his hand
upon the Indians shoulder
You mean to watch then he said
The Indian nodded quickly his eyes gazing searchingly at the lawyer the
while
Are you going in or here
My place was at the Sahibs door
Good said the solicitor bowing his head and he returned to the
drawingroom Ramo watching him suspiciously till the door closed
As he stood there the dusky tint of the robe he now wore seemed to lend
itself to the surrounding gloom being almost invisible against the
portal as he remained there with his fingers nervously quivering and
his face drawn by the agitation of his breast
He shook his head violently the next moment clasped his hands together
and sank down once more upon the lionskin mat bent to the very floor
more like some rounded mass than a human being while the great centaur
was indistinctly seen with his raised club as if about to repeat the
blow that had crushed the old Indian into a motionless heap
CHAPTER FOUR
THE LAWYERS TIN BOX
This has been a terrible week Katrine said Lydia Lawrence taking
her cousins hand
Do you think so
Oh yes  I have not your sang froid  I would give anything to go
back to the country
I have been curious to know all about the will  That old man has been
maddening  He might have spoken
But his instructions clear  The will was to be read after he had lain
there a week
Lain in state said Katrine with a curl of her lip  With a savage
crouching on a lionskin at his door like some dog  Pah  It is absurd
More like a scent in a French play than a bit of nineteenth century
life
Lydia sighed
I felt greatly relieved when those dreadful men had gone
What the Italian professors  Pooh what a child you are  I did not
mind
Lydia gazed at her with a feeling of shrinking wonder and there was
something almost fierce in the beautiful eyes as Katrine sat there by
one of the tables of the illlit drawingroom the two pairs of wax
candles in oldfashioned silver sticks seeming to emit but a feeble
light and but for the warm glow of the fire the great room would have
been sombre in the extreme
What time is it Lydia  There dont start like that  What a kitten
you are
You spoke so suddenly dear  It is halfpast ten
Only halfpast ten  Nearly an hour and a half before the play begins
I wish we had kept the tea things
Pray dont speak so lightly Katrine
I cant help it  It is so absurd for the old man to have left
instructions for all this meretricious romance to surround his end  As
for old Girtle he seems to delight in it and goes about the house
rubbing his hands like an undertaker
Katrine
Well he does  Will read at halfpast eleven at night on the tenth day
after the old mans death  It is absurd  Ah well I suppose a
millionaire has a right to be eccentric if he likes
Dear Katrine he was always so good
Good  Bah  What did he ever do for me  He hated my branch of the
family and our Creole blood  As if the DEnghiens were not a fine old
French family before the Capels were heard of
But Katrine
I will speak  I was dragged here to be present at this mummery to
have for my share a hundred pounds to buy mourning and I vow Ill spend
it in Chinese mourning and wear yellow instead of black  Why dont
those men come up instead of sitting smoking in that diningroom and
leaving us alone in this mausoleum of a place  Here ring and send for
them Im getting nervous too  Im catching it from youweak little
baby that you are
At that moment the door opened and the two young men entered to go up
to them both speaking to Lydia and then drawing their chairs nearer to
Katrine
Are you nearly ready for the play Mr Capel she said after a time
The play he exclaimed
Yes the curtain will rise directly  How do you feel Gerard
Oh I dont know  I want to hear how many chips the old boy has left
me  Deuced glad to get out of this tomb  I say would you mind me
lighting a cigar
I dont mind said Katrine lightly
Would you mind Miss Lawrence
Mindyour smokinghere said Lydia hastily  II dont think I
should but
No no said Capel it is impossible  For heavens sake pay a
little respect to the ladies if you cannot to the dead
Artis started to his feet
Look here Paul Capel he cried angrily you have taken upon yourself
several times since I have been lockedup here with you to use
confoundedly offensive language to me  How dare you speak to me like
that
Dare cried Capel rising  Pooh he ejaculated throwing himself
back and glancing at Katrine whose eyes seemed to flash with eager
pleasure while Lydia half rose with extended hands I am forgetting
