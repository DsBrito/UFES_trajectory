good girl but she did not like to have others get good things when she
did not have any herself If any person gave one of her brothers an
apple or an orange she seemed to think she ought to have it
When she was a baby she used to cry for every thing she saw and would
give her parents no peace till they gave it to her I am sorry to say
they were sometimes very weak on this point and gave her things which
she ought not to have had just to quiet her
Her father and mother hoped when she grew older she would not want
every thing that belonged to her brothers If Charles had a plaything
Katy wanted it and would cry till she got it Very often just to make
her stop crying her mother made poor Charley give up the thing
But as Katy grew older she seemed to want every thing that others had
just as much as ever She was now ten years old and still she did not
like to see others have any thing which she could not have It is true
she did not always say so but she felt it just as much and was very
apt to be cross and sullen towards those whom she envied
Nellie Green was not at all like her sister She was only eight years
old but there was not a bit of envy in her She would give a part and
often the whole of her apples oranges candy and playthings to her
sister and to her brothers She liked to see them happy and when
Charley ate an apple it tasted just as good to her as though she were
eating it herself
She was not selfish She would always divide her good things with her
friends Did you ever see a little boy or a little girl eating an apple
or some candy and another little boy or girl standing by and looking
just as if he wanted some
Nellie always gave her friends a part and then she not only enjoyed
what she ate herself but she enjoyed what they ate This is the way to
make apples oranges and candy taste good
One New Years Day Katys aunt after whom she was named sent her a
beautiful wax doll It was a very pretty doll and the little girl was
the happiest child in Riverdale when the welcome present reached her
There was another little girl in Riverdale who was almost if not quite
as happy and that was Nellie her sister It is true the doll was not
for her she did not own any of it and Katy would hardly let her touch
it but for all this Nellie was pleased to see her sister so happy
The dollys name was Lady Jane for Katy thought as she was a very
fine doll she ought to have a very fine name So when she spoke to the
dolland she talked a great deal with hershe always called her Lady
Jane
The two little girls had five or six other dolls but none of them were
any thing near such fine ladies as Lady Jane Their heads were made of
porcelain or rubber or composition and they had grown so old that
they were really ugly
Miss Lucy who had a rubber head looked as though she had been through
the wars Her nose was worn out so that she had a great hole in the
end of it I suppose if she had wanted to sneeze this hole would have
been very handy but Miss Lucy was a very proper young lady and never
sneezed in company If she ever sneezed when alone of course there was
no one present to know any thing about it
There was another hole right in the top of her head so that if she had
had any brains they would certainly have leaked out but as Miss Lucy
was not a strongminded woman I suppose she had no use for brains
One of the family of dolls was a little black girl whose name was
Dinah She had seen hard service in her day and did not look as though
is she would last much longer
Miss Fanny had once been a fine lady but times had gone hard with her
and her fine clothes were both ragged and dirty But hard times were not
so very bad for she wore the same smile as when her clothes had been
new and nice
Miss Mary was a poor cripple By a sad accident she had broken one of
her legs Katy placed her on a table one day and either because the
height from the floor made her dizzy or because she was laid too near
the edge she had tumbled off and one leg was so badly broken that
neither a wooden nor a cork one could be fastened in its place
Therefore Miss Mary could not walk about the room and never went any
where except when she was carried But she was not half so badly off as
Miss Susie who had broken her neck and lost off her head The head was
tied on with a string but it kept falling off while the family were at
play but Miss Susie did not seem to mind it at all
She got along a great deal better without her head than you and I could
without ours Indeed she wore the same smile upon her face whether the
head was on or offwhich teaches us that we ought always to be cheerful
in misfortune
Besides these fine young ladies there were two or three rag babies but
as you could not tell by the looks of them what they were thinking
about I will not say any thing about them They had no virtues worth
telling they never ate soup with a fork or gave money to the poor
Some of my readers may not think much of this family of dollies but I
am sure Katy and Nellie had fine times with them They used to spend
hours together with them and the dollies used to do every thing that
any body could do
Miss Fanny used to visit a great deal in spite of her dirty ragged
clothes so did Miss Lucy with two holes in her head and Miss Mary
with her broken leg and Miss Susie with her broken neck All of them
used to go avisiting except Miss Dinah and she being a black girl
had to do the sweeping and tend the door
These ladies were all of them so bashful that they would not speak in
company and Katy and Nellie had to do all the talking for them
But they used to make believe the dollies talked and this did just as
well They used to say just such things as the ladies did who called on
Mrs Green and never left without being urged to stay longer and also
to call again which they always promised to do
On the whole they were very wonderful dollies at least they were until
Lady Jane came and she was such a fine lady with her white silk dress
and her real hair that none of them could shine after that
Illustration Lend us your Dolly
II
One day Flora Lee came to see Nellie Green and to spend the afternoon
with her It was in the month of November and the weather was too cold
to permit them to play in the garden so they said they would have a
good time in the house
Katy Green had to go away and could not play with them Nellie was
very sorry for this for she not only liked to have her sister with her
but she also wanted the company of Lady Jane
She told Flora how sorry she was and they agreed that it was too bad
Katy had to go away for she was older than they and could help them a
great deal in their plays Besides they wanted one fine lady among the
dollies for they had a certain play which required just such a person
I wish I had brought Miss Dolly with me I guess she is fine enough
said Flora
I wish you had replied Nellie but as you have not we cant help it
now I dare say Miss Fanny will do
Ill tell you what you can do Nellie
What
You can just ask Katy to lend you her dolly We wont hurt her a mite
you know We will use her just as if she were made of glass
Nellie did not know what to say She did not like to ask Katy to let her
play with Lady Jane for she knew how careful her sister was of her fine
lady And she did not like to tell Flora her thoughts lest she should
think her sister was selfish She did not like to have any one think
hard of her sister
We must have Lady Jane I dont see how we can get along without her
added Flora a little puzzled by the silence of Nellie
I dont like to ask Katy said Nellie at last
Why not She will let you have her Of course she will let you have
her added Flora warmly
I dont think she will You know we might break her neck or lose off
her legs or arms or we might dirty her white silk dress
But we will be very careful Let us go and ask her It wont do any
harm to ask her you know She cant do any more than refuse
Nellie did not like to be refused and she tried to prevent Flora from
going any farther in the matter She was sorry to have it appear that
her sister was selfish and she thought more of this than she did of
being refused
Flora said so much that at last she thought Katy might let her have the
doll and they ran down stairs to the sitting room to have the matter
settled
Will you lend us your dolly Katy asked Nellie and the tones of her
voice showed how doubtful she was of the result of the question
What dolly do you mean asked Katy
Your wax dollyLady Jane
I am very sure I shall not replied Katy
We will be very careful of her added Flora We wont let her be
hurt a bityou may depend on that
Im not going to let you have my dolly to break and spoilIm sure I
shall not said Katy who even seemed to be angry because she was
asked
But dont I say we wont hurt it a bit continued Flora And when you
come over to my house you shall have my dolly just as long as you want
her and her house too and all the chairs and tables and things
I dont want them
Do please to let us have Lady Jane teased Nellie We want her ever
so much and I know she wont get broken or dirty Please to lend her to
us Katy
I shant do any such thing so its no use to tease me Why dont you
play with your own dollies I wont lend Lady Janethats flat
Nellie felt so bad she could not help cryingnot because she could not
have the doll but because her sister was so harsh and unkind She would
not have cared so much if Flora had not been there for she did not like
to have her see her sister behave in this manner
Poor Flora wanted to cry too when she saw how badly Nellie felt but
she tried to be brave and placed her arm round her friends neck as if
to let her know that she would be kind to her
Come Nellie lets go up stairs again We wont say any thing more
about it said Flora and she led her out of the room
Now you wont like Katy after this replied Nellie
O yes I will
Katy would have lent us the dolly only aunt Jane gave it to her and
she is afraid it will be broken If it hadnt been for this she would
have lent us Lady JaneI know she would added Nellie wiping away her
tears
I dare say she would but we wont think any thing more about it And
when I come over again some time I will bring her something just to
show her that I dont feel hard towards her
What a dear good girl you are Flora I was afraid you would hate her
after what she said
O dear no I should hope not My mother tells me I must love those
who dont do what I want them to and I try to do so but it is very
hard sometimes I wish you had a wax doll Nellie You ought to have
one you are such a good girl and love your sister so much even when
she is not kind to you
I wish I had one it would be so nice to have one like Lady Jane I
should be so happy but then if only one of us can have one I would
rather Katy had it than have it myself
You are not a bit selfish Nellie Do you know what selfish means I
do
I guess I do It means when you have an apple or any candy to refuse to
give a part to your sister
Yes or to any body that happens to be with you Candy is good but
dont you like to see others eat it almost as well as you do to eat it
yourself
Well yes I think I do
Then you know just what I mean and I guess well play visiting now
So we will and Miss Fanny shall be the great lady and Dinah shall be
her servant
Yes and this shall be her house said Nellie as she placed Miss
Fanny in a large arm chair which they were to make believe was her
elegant mansion
You shall stay here and I will bring Miss Mary to visit Miss Fanny
Flora bounded over to the other side of the room which was supposed to
be the home of the other dolls and Miss Mary in spite of her broken
leg was soon on her way to visit the fine lady
Ting a ling a ling said Flora which meant that the caller had rung
the bell and Dinah appeared at the door
Is Miss Fanny at home asked Flora speaking for the lady with the
broken leg
No marm she is not replied Nellie who had to speak for Dinah
because though her mouth was very large she could not speak for
herself
What an awful fib cried Flora There she is dont I see her through
the door
But thats just the way some of the fine folks do replied Nellie
laughing at Floras earnestness
It is an awful story and I wouldnt say it even in fun
Nellie said she would not say it again only she wanted to have Miss
Fanny do just as the big folks did And so they played all the
afternoon though Lady Jane did not honor them with her company All the
dollies paid lots of visits and Flora went home
Illustration The Christmas Present
III
When Flora reached home she told her mother what a nice time she had
and what splendid visits Miss Lucy and Miss Mary and Miss Susie had made
to Miss Fanny
She could not help telling her mother what a good girl Nellie was and
how she loved her sister even when she was unkind and spoke pettishly
to her
Then she told her how much she wished Nellie had a wax doll with real
hair and a white silk dress Mrs Lee thought such a good girl ought to
have one and the very next time she went to the city she bought the
prettiest wax doll she could find for her
Flora was full of joy when she saw the doll and learned whom it was
for She was a great deal happier than if the doll had been bought for
herself and she wanted to run right over to Mr Greens with the
beautiful present She longed to see the eyes of Nellie sparkle as she
saw the doll and to hear what she would say when told it was for her
But Mrs Lee thought they had better keep the doll till Christmas and
let her find it with her stocking in the morning
But then I shant see her when she first gets the dolly said Flora
That is true but you must write a little note which shall be pinned
on the dolls dress
That will be splendid mother And I will go right away and write the
note now
Flora got a pencil and a piece of paper and seated herself in the
corner She worked away for half an hour as busy as a bee and then she
carried the note to her mother She was not much of a writer having
been to school only a year She could only print the note
Flora was very fond of writing notes and long before she could make a
single letter she would fill up a piece of paper with pothooks and
spiders legs and send them to her mother and Frank
She did not spell all the words right but her mother told her how to
correct them and then she printed the note over again on a nice sheet
of giltedged paper Thinking my little friends might want to see this
note I place a copy of it in the book just exactly as she wrote it
Illustration Dear Nellie
This Dolly Is From Me I Love You Very Much And I Wish You A Merry
Christmas
Flora Lee
When Christmas morning came Nellie found the doll in a chair close by
her stocking I cant tell you how pleased she was but you can all
guess Then she took the note from the dress and read it She was more
pleased than ever to find it was from Flora
She almost cried with joy as she puzzled out the note and thought how
kind Flora and her mother were to remember her
What a dear you are Miss Dolly said she as she took up the doll and
kissed her just as though she had been a real live baby You and I
shall be firstrate friends just as long as we live I will take such
good care of you Dear me Why mother Only think
What is the matter Nellie asked Mrs Green who was almost as much
pleased as her daughter
Did you see that
What child What do you mean
Did you see those eyes
Yes I see them
Why just as true as I am alive she moved them
I think not my child She is a very handsome doll but I dont think
she could move her eyes if she tried ever so hard
But she did I know she did and Nellie took hold of her head to
examine it more closely As she did so she bent the body a little
There as true as I live she moved them again
Mrs Green took the doll and found that the eyes did really move It
was funny but it was true Mrs Lee and Flora knew all about it The
eyes were made of glass and there was something inside of the doll
which moved them when the body was bent
Let me see said Katy who had been looking on in silence all this
time Nellie gave her the doll at once and she bent the body and saw
the eyes move twenty times The happy owner of Miss Dolly waited with
patience till her sister had done with her
Why didnt aunt Jane get me one like that I wonder said Katy when
she gave the doll to Nellie
I suppose she could not afford to buy one like this for she is not so
rich as Mrs Lee
But you shall have her to play with just when you want her said
Nellie
Pooh I dont want your old dolly snarled Katy She isnt half so
good as mine I would rather have Lady Jane than have her any day
Why then did you wish your aunt Jane had given you one like this
asked her mother
I dont care for her old dolly She may keep it for all me replied
Katy
But it shall be yours just as much as mine Katy said Nellie in
tones so gentle and sweet that her sister ought to have kissed her for
them and loved her more than she ever loved her before
But she did not She was envious She was sorry the doll had been given
to Nelliesorry because it was a prettier one than her own It was a
very wicked feeling She had some presents of her own but her envy
spoiled all the pleasure she might have taken in them
Nellie was almost sorry the doll had been given to her when she saw how
Katy felt about it Mrs Green talked to the envious girl till she
cried about her conduct She tried to make her feel how odious and
wicked envy made her
Whenever Katy saw the new doll she seemed to be angry with her sister
Poor Nellies pleasure was nearly spoiled and she even offered to
exchange her doll for Katys but her mother would not let her do so
In a few days however she seemed to feel better and the two sisters
had some good times with their dolls I say she seemed to feel better
but she really did not She did not like it that Nellies doll was a
finer one than her own
Yet Nellie was happier for she thought Katy was cured of her ill
feeling Then she loved her doll more than ever She was a cunning
little girl and she thought so much of her new friend that she always
used to say Dolly and I
When her mother asked her where she had been she would reply Dolly
and I have been having a nice time up stairs Dolly and I used to do
ever so many things and no two little ladies could ever enjoy
themselves more than did Dolly and Nellie
I am sorry to say that Katy did not like Dolly at all She could never
forgive her for moving her eyes because Lady Jane could not move hers
It is true that after she saw how silly and wicked her envy made her
appear to others she tried very hard not to show it
We may be just as wicked without showing our sin to others as we can be
when we let the world see just what we are When we are wicked the sin
is more in the heart than in the actions
Men may seem to be very good when they are really very bad though
people almost always find out such persons Katy was just as wicked
just as envious when her sister thought she was kind and loving as she
was on that Christmas morning when the doll was found in the chamber
You will be surprised and sorry when you see just how wicked her envy
made her I shall tell you about it in the next chapter and I hope it
will lead you to drive any such feeling from your own hearts If you
have such feelings they will make you very unhappy and the sooner you
begin to get rid of them the better

Illustration What Katy did
IV
Lady Jane and Miss Dolly were kept in the lower drawer of the bureau
for they were very fine young ladies and Mrs Green wished to have them
kept clean and nice
One day about two weeks after Miss Dolly was given to Nellie both she
and Katy had been playing with the dolls When the bell rang for tea
they ran down stairs but before they went they put the dolls in the
drawer As they were in a hurry they were not very careful and the
dresses of both the dolls were sadly tumbled
Mrs Green who was in the room saw in what manner Miss Dolly and Lady
Jane had been thrown into the drawer and before she went down to tea
she took them both out smoothed down their dresses and put them back
in a more proper manner
Katy and Nellie had had some talk about their dolls and the envious
girl had said hers was better than her sisters Nellie did not dispute
with her about it but she saw that Katy had not got over that bad
feeling yet
The children ate their suppers and not a word more was said about the
dolls but Katy looked very sour She was thinking about Miss Dollys
eyes and wishing Lady Janes eyes would move like the others
She finished her supper and ran up stairs again By this time it was
quite dark in the room where the dolls were kept and Nellie and her
mother wondered why she went up stairs at that late hour
Katy was still thinking of those eyes She thought her aunt Jane was
real mean not to buy her such a doll and then she was very sorry that
Floras mother had bought it for her sister
While she was thinking these wicked thoughts she went to the bureau and
opened the lower drawer It was so dark she could hardly see the dolls
but she took out one of them
Your dolly shall not be better than mine any longer said she to
herself
As she said this she took the scissors from the work basket on the
bureau and finding one of the eyes with her fingers she struck one of
the points right into it Then she turned the scissors so as entirely
to destroy the eye Not content with this she spoiled the other eye in
the same manner
Now your doll isnt so good as mine any how said she to herself as
she put the poor spoiled lady back into the drawer
I would not have a little girl feel as she felt then for all the world
Her heart was full of envy and wickedness To gratify her ill feeling
she had thrust the scissors into the eyes of the doll She knew how
badly her sister would feel but she did not care for this Now Lady
Jane was the best doll and she did not care for any thing else
She staid in the room but a few moments Closing the drawer she
hastened down stairs and took a seat by the fire She tried to look as
though nothing had happened but she was sour and sullen for she felt
that she had done a very naughty act
Come Katy let us go up stairs and play with the dollies again said
Nellie when she had got through with her supper
I dont want to replied she without even looking at her sister
Do come Katy
I tell you I dont want to snarled she
You can bring your dolly down stairs and play with her here Nellie
said her mother
May I mother
You maytake a light with you
I dont want any light mother I can find her just as well in the
dark and away she ran to get the doll
Dont you think Katy trembled then She did tremble like a leaf and
wished she had not done the naughty deed In a moment Nellie would
return with poor Miss Dolly whose eyes had been spoiled with the
scissors She did not think it would be found out so soon and she could
not think what to say before the doll came down
She felt just as though she should sink through the floor when Nellie
came into the room with the doll in her arms There would be an awful
time in a moment and her father and mother would want to know who had
spoiled Miss Dollys eyes
They knew she had been up stairs since tea and they would charge her
with the naughty act She meant to deny it for those who are wicked
enough to do such things are almost always wicked enough to lie about
them
Now wont you and I have a nice time Dolly said Nellie as she
rushed into the sitting room with the doll in her arms Come Katy
lets play Dolly is the queen of England
I dont want to play
Wellwont you make me a crown for her
I cant
Katy was waiting for her sister to find out the mischief that had been
done and she dreaded the moment when she should do so She did not dare
to look at her for fear her looks might betray her
You shall be queen without any crown said Nellie as she placed the
doll on the table This pincushion shall be your throne There you
look just like a queendont she mother
I think she does replied Mrs Green with a smile I hope she will
be as good as Queen Victoria
She will motheronly she ought to have a crown
I have got a piece of gilt paper up stairs and I will make her one
Im going up in a minute
Katy not daring to look yet did not know what to think of this talk
How could the doll look like a queen when her eyes had been punched out
with the scissors It was very strange to her and she stole a glance at
the queenly Miss Dolly on the table
There she was seated on her pincushion throne just as if nothing had
happened Her eyes were just as bright as ever and as Nelly bent her
body she moved them as well as ever she could
Katy did not know what to make of it She had certainly driven the
scissors into the eyes of the doll as hard as she could but there was
Miss Dolly as good as new She could not explain it and it was of no
use to try
Mrs Green brought down the scissors and cut out the crown Then Miss
Dolly certainly looked like a queen and Nelly spent a very pleasant
hour with her majesty till it was time for her to go to bed
Katy was very unhappy She had not done what she meant to do and she
was filled with doubt But she did not have to wait long to find out
what she had done When Mrs Green went up stairs with the children
Miss Dolly had to be put to bed first for she was a queen
When the bureau drawer was opened what do you think they saw There lay
Lady Jane with both of her eyes punched out
Katy burst into tears when she saw that her doll was entirely spoiled
Then she found that she had made a mistake In the darkness she had
punched out the eyes of Lady Jane instead of Miss Dolly This is the
way that wicked people often punish themselves instead of others
Her mother had changed the places of the dolls in the drawer and this
was the reason why Katy had made the mistake Dont you think it served
her right
Katy felt so badly that she could not tell any of the lies she had made
up and the truth was found out by her mother Mrs Green scolded her
for what she had done and for what she meant to do The naughty girl
cried herself to sleep that night but poor Lady Jane was utterly
ruined
Nellie felt almost as bad as her sister and said all she could to
console her The next day Katy was so ashamed of herself that she did
not wish to see any body But in a few days she got over it and her
mother hoped the affair would do her a great deal of good Whenever she
showed a spirit of envy Mrs Green reminded her of her doll and she
tried to conquer the feeling but it took many years to cure her
When you envy others although you may not punch out the eyes of your
own doll you hurt yourself more than any one else
