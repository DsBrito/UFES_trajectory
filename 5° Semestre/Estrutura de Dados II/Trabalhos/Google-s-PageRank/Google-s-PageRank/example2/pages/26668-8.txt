THE STRANGE ADVENTURES
OF
CAPTAIN DANGEROUS
A Narrative in Old fashioned English
CHAPTER THE FIRST
OF SUNDRY MY ADVENTURES FROM THE TIME OF MY GOING
ABROAD UNTIL MY COMING TO MANS ESTATE WHICH WAS
ALL THE ESTATE I HAD
A STRANGE Nursingmotherrather a Stepmother of the Stoniest sortwas
this Sir Basil Hopwood Knight and Alderman of London that contracted
with the Government to take us Transports abroad Sure there never was a
man on this side the land of Horseleeches that was so Hungry after
money Yet was his avarice not of the kind practised by old Audley the
moneyscrivener of the Commonwealths time or Hopkins the wretch that
saved candles ends and yet had a thousand waxlights blazing at his
Funeral or Guy the Bookseller that founded the Hospital in Southwark
or even old John Elwes Esquire the admired Miser of these latter days
Sir Basil Hopwood was the rather of the same complexion of Entrails with
that Signor Volpone whom we have all seenat least such of us as be old
Boysin Ben Jonsons play of the Fox He Moneygrubbed and
Moneyclutched and Moneywrung ay and in a manner Moneystole that
he might live largely and ruffle it among his brother Cits in
surpassing state and splendour He had been Lord Mayor and on his
Showday the Equipments of chivalry had been more Sumptuous the Banners
more varied the Entertainment at Saddlers Hallwhere the Lord Mayor
was wont to hold his Feast before the present Mansion House was built
the ancient Guildhall in King Street being then but in an ill condition
for banquetHopwoods Entertainment I say had been more plentifully
provided with Marrowbones Custards Ruffs and Reeves Baked Cygnets
Malmsey Canary and Hippocras than had ever been known since the days
of the Merry Mayor who swore that King Charles the Second should take
tother bottle He was a Parliament man too and had a Borough in his
Pocket for the which he kept a WarmingPan membermores the
shamebesides one to serve him as a cushion to sit on
This enormously rich man had a fine House in Bishopsgate Street with as
many rogues in blue liveries as a Rotterdam Syndic that has made three
good ventures in Java When we poor wretches chained together had been
brought up in Carts from Aylesbury to London on our way to be Embarked
nothing would serve this Haughty and Purseproud Citizen but that our
ragged Regiment must halt before his peddling Palace and there the
varlets in blue that attended upon him brought us out Loaves and Cheese
and Blackjacks full of twothread Beer which with many disdainful
gestures and uncivil words they offered to our famished lips And my
Lady Hopwood and the fine Madams her daughtersall laced and
furbelowed and with widows and orphans tears and the blooddrops of
crimped seamen and kidnapped children twinkling in their Stomachers for
gemswere all set at their Bowery window a puddingfed Chaplain
standing bowing and smirking behind them and glozing in their ears no
doubt Praises of their exceeding Charity and Humanity to wretches such
as we were But this Charity Jack says I to myself is not of the
Shapcott sort and is but base metal after all My troth but we wanted
the Bread and Cheese and Swipes for we had had neither Bite nor Sup
since we left Aylesbury Gaol sevenandtwenty hours agone So after a
while and the mob hallooing at us for Gallowsbirds and some Ruffians
about the SouthSea House pelting us with stonesfor Luck as they
saidwe were had over London Bridgewhere with dreadful admiration I
viewed the Heads and Quarters of Traitors all shimmering in the coat of
pitch i the Sun over the North Turretand were bestowed for the
night in the Borough Clink And hither we were pursued by the Aldermans
Agents who straightway began to drive Unholy Bargains with those among
us that had Money Now twas selling them Necessaries for the voyage at
exorbitant rates or promising them for cash in hand to deliver them
Luxuries such as Tobacco playingcards and strong waters at the Port
of Embarkation Now twas substituting Light for Heavy Fetters if the
Heaviness could be Assuaged by Gold and sometimes even negotiations
were carried so far as for the convicted persons to give Drafts of
Exchange to be honoured by their Agents in London so soon as word came
from the Plantations that they had been placed in Tolerable Servitude
instead of Agonising Slavery For although there was then as there is
now a convenient Fiction that a Felons goods became at once forfeit to
the Crown I never yet knew a Felon and I have known many that felt
ever so little difficulty in keeping his property if he had any and
disposing of it according to his own Good Will and Pleasure
The Head Gaoler of the Borough ClinkI know not how his Proper official
title ranwas a colonel in the Foot Guards who lived in Jermyn Street
St Jamess and transacted most of his High and Mighty business either
at Poingdestres Ordinary in St Albans Place or at Whites Chocolate
House to say naught of the Rose or the Key in Chandos Street Much
truly did he concern himself about his unhappy Captives His place was
a Patent one and was worth to him about Fifteen Hundred a year at
which sum it was farmed by Sir Basil Hopwood who in his turn on the
principle that tis scurvy money that wont stick to your fingers
underlet the place to a Company of Four Rogues who gave him Two
Thousand for that which they managed to swell into at least Three for
themselves by squeezing of Poor Prisoners and the like crying
Injustices Twas Aylesbury Gaol over again with the newest
improvements and the Humours of the Town added to it So when Sir
Basil Hopwood took up a cargo of cast persons for Transportation his
underlings of the Borough Clink were only too glad to harbour them for a
night or two making a pretty profit out of the poor creatures For all
which I doubt it not Sir Basil Hopwood and his scoundrelly Myrmidons
are at this instant moment Howling
This place was a prison for Debtors as well as Criminals and was to the
full as Foul as the Tophetpit at Aylesbury yonder I had not been there
half an hour before a Lively companion of a Gentleman Cutpurse with a
wrench at my kerchief a twist at my arm which nearly Broke it in
twain and a smart Blow under my Lower Jaw robs me of the packet of
comforts clothing pressed beef sugar comfits and the like which my
kind friends at Aylesbury had given me The Rascal comes to me a few
minutes afterwards with a packet of Soap and a Testament which he had
taken from my Bundle and returns them to me with a Grin telling me
that it was long since his Body had felt need of the one or his Soul of
the other And yet I think they would have profited considerably
pending a Right Cord by the application of Both So I in a corner to
moan and whimper at my Distressed condition
A sad Sunday I spent in the Clinktwas on the Monday we were to
startalthough to some other of my companions the Time passed
jovially enough For very many of the Relations and Friends of the
Detained Persons came to visit them bringing them money victuals
clothing and other Refreshments Twas on this day I heard that one of
us who was cast for Forgery had been offered a Free Pardon if he could
lodge Five Hundred Pounds in the hands of a Person who had Great
Influence near a Great Man
Late on the Sunday afternoon Sir Basil Hopwood came down in his coach
and with his chaplain attendant on him We Convicts were all had to the
Grate for the Knight and Alderman would not venture further in for
fear of the Gaol Fever and he makes us a Fine Speech about the Kings
Mercywhich I deny notand his own Infinite Goodness in providing
for us in a Foreign Land The which I question Then he told us how we
were to be very civil and obedient on the voyage to those who were set
over us refraining from cursing swearing gaming or singing of
profane songs on pain of immediate and smart chastisement and having
said this and the chaplain having given us his Benediction he gat him
gone and we were rid of so much Rapacious and Luxurious Hypocrisy We
lay in the yard that night wrapped in such extra Garments as some of us
were Fortunate enough to have and I sobbed myself to sleep wishing I
well remember that it might never be Day again but that my Sorrows
might all be closed in by the Merciful Curtain of Eternal Night
So on the Monday morning we were driven downa body of Sir Basil
Hopwoods own company of the Trainbands guarding usto Shaylers
Stairs near unto the church of St Mary Overy and therewe were in
number about a hundredput on board a Hoy which straightway the tide
being toward bore down the river for Gravesend
By this time I found that almost insensibly as it were I had become
separated from my old companions the Blacks and that I was more than
ever Alone The greatest likelihood is that Authority deemed it
advisable to break up for good and all the Formidable Confederacy they
had laid hold of and to prevent those Dangerous Men from ever again
making Head together But my whole Life was but a kind of Shifting and
uncertain Vision and I took little note of the personages with whom I
came in contact till looking around me in a dull listlessness about
the Hoy I found myself cheek by jowl with a motley crew seemingly
picked up haphazard from all the gaols in England But twas all one to
me and I did not much care Such a Stupor of Misery came over me that
for a time I almost forgot my good Quaker Friends and the lessons they
had taught me that I felt myself once more drifting into being a
dangerous little brute and that seeing the Master of the Hoy a
thirstylooking man lifting a great stonebottle to his lips I longed
to serve him as I had served Corporal Foss with the demijohn of Brandy
in the upper chamber of the Stag o Tyne
We landed not at Gravesend but were forthwith removed to a bark called
The Humane Hopwood in compliment I suppose to Sir Basil and which
after lying three days in the Downs put into Deal to complete her
complement of Unfortunate Persons And I remember that before making
Deal we saw a stranded Brig on the Goodwins which was said to be a
Leghorner very rich with oils and silks round which were
gatheredjust as you may see obscene Birds of Prey gathered round a
dead carcass and picking the Flesh from its bonesat least a score of
luggers belonging to the Deal Boatmen These worthies had knocked holes
in the hull of the wreck and were busily hauling out packages and casks
into their craft coming to blows sometimes with axes and marlinspikes
as to who should have the Biggest Booty And it was said on Board that
they would not unfrequently decoy by false signals or positively haul
a vessel in distress on to those same Goodwinsin whose fatal depths
so many tall Ships lie Engulfedin order to have the Plunder of her
which was more profitable than the Salvage that being in the longrun
mostly swallowed up by the Crimps and Longshore Lawyers of Deal and
other Ports who were wont to buy the Boatmens rights at a Ruinous
Discount Salvage Men indeed these Boatmen might well be called for
when I was young it was their manner to act with an extreme of Savage
Barbarity thinking far less of saving Human Life than of clutching at
the waifs and strays of a Rich Cargo And then up would sheer a
CustomHouse cutter or a Revenue Pink the skipper and his crew fierce
in their Defence of the Laws of the Land the Admiralty Droits and
their own twentieths and from Hard blows with fists and spikes matters
would often come to the arbitrament of cutlasses and firearms so that
naval Engagements of a Miniature kind have often raged between the Deal
Boatmen and the Kings Officers Surely the world was a Hard and a Cruel
and a Brutal one when I was youngbating the PoorLaws which were
more merciful than at present for now that I am old the Gazettes are
full of the Tender Valour and Merciful Devotion of the Deal Boatmen
who in the most tempestuous weather will leave their warm beds their
wives and bairns and put off with the Sea running mountains high to
rescue Distraught Vessels and the Precious Lives that are within them
The Salvage Men of my time were brave enough but they were likewise
unconscionable rogues
The wind proved false to us at Deal and we had to wait a weary ten days
there Captain Handsell was our commander He was a man who knew but one
course of proceeding Twas always a word and a blow with him By the
same token the blow generally came first and the word that followed was
sure to be a bad one The Captain of a Ship from a Fishing Smack to a
ThreeDecker was in those days a cruel and merciless Despot Twas only
the size of his ship and the number of his Equipage that decided the
question whether he was to be a Petty Tyrant or a Tremendous One His
Empire was as undisputed as that of a Schoolmaster Who was to gainsay
him To whom at Sea could his victims appeal To the Sharks and
Grampuses the Dolphins and the Bonettas He was privileged to beat to
fetter to starve to kick to curse his Seamen Even his Passengers
trembled at the sight of this Bashaw of Bluewater for he had Irons and
Rations of Mouldy Biscuit for them too if they offended him and many a
Beautiful and Haughty Lady paying full cabinpassage has bowed down
before the wrath of a vulgar Skipper who at home she would have
thought unworthy to Black her Shoes and who would be seething in the
revelry of a Tavern in Rotherhithe while she would be footing it in the
Saloons of St Jamess Yet for a little time at the outset of his
voyage the Skipper had his superior the Bashaw had a Vizier who was
bigger than he There was a Terrible Man called the Pilot He cared no
more for the Captain than the Archbishop of Canterbury cares for a
CharityBoy He gave him a piece of his mind whenever he chose and he
would have his own Way and had it It was the delight of the Seamen to
see their Tyrant and Bully degraded for a time under the supreme
authority of the Pilot who drank the Skippers rum who had the best
Beef and Burgoo at the Skippers table who wore if he was so minded
the Skippers tarpaulin who used the Skippers telescope and thumbed
his charts and kicked his Cabinboy and swore his oaths till but for
the fear of the Trinity House I think the Skipper would have been
mighty glad to fling him over the taffrail But the reign of this Great
Mogul of Lights and Points and Creeks soon came to an end A River Pilot
was the lesser evil a Channel Pilot was the greater one but both were
got rid of at last Then the Skipper was himself again He would drink
himself blind with Punch in the forenoon or cob his cabinboy to
Deaths door after dinner for a frolic He could play the very Devil
among the Hands and they perforce bore with his capricious cruelty for
there is no running away from a Ship at Sea Jack Shark is Gaoler and
keeps the door tight There is but one way out of it and that is to
Mutiny and hey for the Black Flag and a Pirates Free and Jovial
LifeA But Mutiny is Hanging and Piracy is Hanging and Gibbeting
too and how seldom it is that you find Bold Hearts who have Stuff
enough in them to Run the Great Risk As on sea so it is on land That
Ugly Halter dances before a mans eyes and dazes him away from the
Firmest Resolve For how long will Schoolboys endure the hideous
enormities of a Gnawbit before they come to the Supreme Revolt of a
Barringout And for how long will a People suffer the mad tyranny of a
Ruler who outrages their Laws who strangles their Liberties who
fleeces and squeezes and tramples upon them before they take Heart of
Grace and up Pike and Musket and downderrydown with your Ruler who
is ordinarily the basest of Poltroons and runs away in a fright so soon
as the first Goose is bold enough to cry out that the Capitol shall be
saved
Nothing of this did I think aboard The Humane Hopwood I was too young
to have any thought at all save of rage and anguish when it pleased
Captain Handsell being in a cheerful mood to belabour me till I was
black and blue with a ropes end At the beginning of the voyage I was
put into the hold ironed with the rest of the convicts who were only
permitted to come on deck twice a day morning and evening for a few
Mouthfuls of Fresh air who were fed on the vilest biscuit and the most
putrid water getting but a scrap of fat pork and a dram of Rum that was
like Fire twice a week and who were treated generally much like
Negroes on the Middle Passage But by and bysay after ten days but I
took little account of Time in this floating PurgatoryCaptain
Handsell had me unironed and his cabinboy a poor weakly little lad
that could not stand much beating being dead of that and a flux and so
thrown overboard without any more words being said about ithe was but
a little Scottish castaway from Edinburgh who had been kidnapped late
one night in the Grass Market and sold to a Greenock skipper trading in
that line for a hundred pound Scotsnot above eight pounds of our
currencyand there is no Crowners Quest at sea I was promoted to the
Vacant Post I was Strong enough now and the Wound in my side gave me
no more pain and I think I grew daily stronger and more hardened under
the shower of blows which the Skipper very liberally dealt out to me I
hardly know with more plenitude when he was vexed or when he was
pleased But I was not the same bleating little Lamb that the Wolfish
Gnawbit used to torture No no John Dangerouss apprenticeship had
been useful to him Even as collegelads graduate in their Latin and
Greek so I had graduated upon braining the Grenadier with the demijohn
I could take kicks and cuffs but I could likewise give them And so as
this Roaring Skipper made me a Block to vent his spite upon I would
struggle with and bite and kick his shins till sometimes we managed to
fall together on the cabinfloor and tumble about therepull he pull
I and a kick togethertill the Watch would look down the skylight
upon us grinning and chuckle hoarsely that old Belzey as they called
their commander being a diminutive for Beelzebub and his young Imp
were having a tussle Thus it came about that among these unthinking
Seamen I grew to be called Pug who I have heard is the Lesser Fiend
or Little Brimstone or young Pitchladle And then I in my Impish way
would offer to fight them too resenting their scurril nicknames and
telling them that I had but one name which was Jack Dangerous
The oddest thing in the world was that the Skipper Ungovernable Brute
as he was seemed to take a kind of liking for me through my Resistance
to him
What a young Tigercub it is he would say sometimes swaying about
his Ropes End as if undecided whether to hit me or not Lie down
Rawbones Lie down Tearem
You go to hit me again I would cry all hot and flurried Ill mark
you I will you Tarpaulin Hedgehog
Then in a Rage he would make a Rush at me and Welt me sorely but
oftener he would Relent and opening his Locker would give me a slice of
Sausage or a white Biscuit or a nip of curious Nantz
At last he gave up maltreating me altogether If youd been of the same
kidney as Sawney MGillicuddy he said speaking of the poor little
Scottish lad who Died Id have made you food for fishes long ago
Slid my younker but they should a had their meat tender enough or
theres no vartue in hackled hemp for a lacing But youve got a Heart
my lad and if youre not hanged before youre out of your Teens
youll show the World that you can Bite as well as Bark some of these
days
So I became a prime Favourite with Captain Handsell and in the
Expansion of his Liking towards me he began to give me instruction in
the vocation in which a portion of my life has since with no small
Distinction though I say it that should not been passed Of scientific
Navigation this very Rude and Boorish person knew little if any thing
but as a Practical Seaman he had much skill and experience Indeed if
the Hands had not enjoyed a lively Faith in the solid seagoing
Qualities of FoulWeather Bob as they called him when they did not
choose to give him his demoniacal appellation they would have Mutinied
and sent him Lashed to a grating on a voyage of Discovery at least
twice in every TwentyFour Hours For he led them a most Fearful Life
I had imparted to him that I was somewhat of a scholar and that Captain
Night had taught me something besides stealing the Kings Deer There
was a Bible on Board which the Skipper never readand read indeed
he was scarcely able to dobut which he turned to the unseemly use
when he had been overcruel to his crew of swearing them upon it that
they would not inform against him when they got into port For this was
an odd medley of a man and had his moments of Remorse for evildoing
or else of Fear as to what might be the Consequences when he reached a
Land where some degree of Law and Justice were recognised At some times
he would propitiate his crew with donatives of Rum or even of Money
but the next day he would have his Cruelty Fit on again and use his men
with ten times more Fierceness and Arbitrary Barbarity But to this
Bible and a volume of Nautical Tables our Library was confined and as
he troubled himself very little about the latter I was set to read to
him sometimes after dinner from the Good Book But he was ever coarse
and ungovernable and would have no Righteous Doctrine or Tender
Precepts but only took delight when I read to him from the Old
Scriptures the stories of the Jews their bloody wars and how their
captains and men of war slew their Thousands and their Tens of Thousands
in Battle And with shame I own that twas these Furious Narratives that
I liked also and with exceeding pleasure read of Joshua his victories
and Samson his achievements and Gideon how he battled and Agag how
they hewed him in pieces Little cockering books I see now put forth
with pretty decoying pictures which little children are bidden to read
Stories from the Old Testament are dressed up in pretty sugared
language Oh you makers of these little books oh you fond mothers who
place them so deftly in your childrens hands bethink you whether this
strong meat is fit for Babes An old man whose life has been passed in
Storms and Stratagems and Violence not innocent of bloodspilling bids
you beware Let the children read that other Book its Sweet and Tender
Counsels its examples of Mercy and Love to all Mankind But if I had a
child five or six years old would I let him fill himself with the
horrible chronicles of Lust and Spoliation and Hatred and Murder and
Revenge Why shouldnt I torture the cat asks little Tommy Didnt
the man in the Good Book tie blazing Torches to the foxes tails And
little Tommy has some show of reason on his side Let the children grow
up wait till their stomachs are strong enough to digest this potent
victual It is hard indeed for one who has been a Protestant alway to
have to confess that when such indiscreet reading is placed in
childrens hands those crafty Romish ecclesiastics speak not altogether
foolishly when they tell us that the mere Word slayeth But on this
point I am agreed to consult Doctor Dubiety and to be bound by his
decision
In so reading to the Skipper every day I did not forget to exercise
myself in that other art of Writing and was in time serviceable enough
to be able to keep in something like a rational and legible form the
Log of The Humane Hopwood which heretofore had been a kind of
cabalistic Register full of blots crosses halfmoons and zigzags
like the chalk score of an unlettered Alewife And the more I read of
surely the grandest and simplest language in the world the more I
discovered how ignorant I was of that essential art of Spelling and
blushed at the vile manner in which the Petition I had written to the
King of England was set down And before we came to our voyages end I
had made a noticeable improvement in the Curious Mystery of writing
Plain English
One day as the Skipper was taking Tobacco for he was a great Smoker
he said to me Jack do you know what you are lad
Your cabinboy I answered bound to fetch and carry hempen wages
and not much better treated than a dog
You lie you scum Captain Handsell answered pleasantly You go
snacks with me in the very best and your beef is boiled in my own
copper But tisnt that I mean Do you know how you hail on the
Worlds books what the number of your mess in Life is
Yes I replied Im a Transport Was to have been hanged but I wrote
out a Petition and the Gentlemen in London gave it to the King God
bless him
Vastly well mate continued the Captain Do you know what a
Transport is
No something very bad I suppose though I dont see that he can be
much worse off than a cabinboy thats been cast for Death and lain in
gaol with a bayonetwound he got from a Grenadierlet alone having
been among the Blacks and paid anigh to Death by Gnawbitwhen he was
born a Gentleman
You lie again To be a Transport is worse than aught youve had Why a
cat in an oven without claws is an Angel of bliss along of a Transport
Youre living in a land of beans and bacon now in a land of milk and
honey and new rum Wait till you get to Jamaica The hundred and odd
vagabonds that Ive got aboard will be given over to the Sheriff at Port
Royal and hell sell em by auction and for as long as theyre sent
across the herringpond theyll be slaves and worse than slaves to the
planters for the black Niggers themselves rot em make a mock of a
Newgate bird Hard work in the blazing sun scarce enough to eat to keep
body and soul together the catoninetails every day with the
cowhide for a change and when your terms out not a Joe in your
pocket to help you to get back to your own country again Thats the
life of a Transport my hearty Why its worse cheer than one of my own
hands gets here on shipboard
I think Id rather be hanged I said with something like a Trembling
come over me at the Picture the Skipper had drawn
I should rather think you would but such isnt your luck little Jack
Dangerous What would you say if I was to tell you that you aint a
Transport at all
I stammered out something I know not what but could make no
substantial reply
Not a bit of it continued Captain Handsell who by this time was
getting somewhat Brisk with his afternoons Punch Hang it whos
afraid I like thee lad Im off my bargain and dont care a salt
herring if Im a loser by a few broad pieces in not sticking to it I
tell thee Jack thourt Free as Free as I am leastways if we get to
Jamaica without going to Davy Joness Locker for on blue water no man
can say hes Free No not the Skipper even
And then he told me to my exceeding Amazement and Delight of what an
Iniquitous Transaction I had very nearly been made the victim It seems
that although the Pardon granted me after the Petition I had sent to his
Majesty was conditional on my transporting myself to the Plantations
further influence had been made for me in Londonby whom I knew not
then but I have since discoveredand on the very Day of the arrival
of our condemned crew in London an Entire and Free Pardon had been
issued for John Dangerous and lodged in the hands of Sir Basil Hopwood
at his House in Bishopsgate Street Along with this merciful Document
there came a letter from one of his Majestys principal Secretaries of
State in which directions were given that I was to be delivered over to
a person who was my Guardian And that I was in no danger of being again
given up to the villains Cadwallader and Talmash or their Instrument
Gnawbit was clear I think from what Captain Handsell told meThat
the Person bringing the letterthe Pardon itself being in the hands of
a Kings Messengerhad the appearance although dressed in a lay habit
of being a Foreign Ecclesiastic The crafty Extortioner of a Knight and
Alderman makes answer that I had not come with the other Transports to
London but had been left sick at Brentford in the care of an agent of
his there but he entreats the Foreign Person to go visit Newgate where
he had another gang of unhappy persons for Transportation and see if I
had arrived And all this while the wretch knew that I was safely
clapped up in the yard of the Borough Clink And the Foreign Person
being met at the Old Bailey by one of Hopwoods creatures this Thing
takes him to walk on the leads of the Sessions House praying him not to
enter the gaol where many had lately been stricken with the Distemper
and by and by up comes a Messenger all hot as it seemed with express
ridingthough his sweat and dust were all Forgedand says that a
gang of Ruffians have broken up the Cage of Brentford where for
greater safety the Boy Dangerous had been bestowed that these Ruffians
were supposed to be the remnant of the Blacks of Charlwood Chase who had
escaped from capture and that they had stolen away the Boy Dangerous
and made clear off with him And indeed it was a curious circumstance
that Brentford Cage was that day broken into the Times were very
Lawless and a Strange Boy taken out therefrom But Hopwood had
artfully separated me from the Blacks who were in Newgate and placed me
among a stranger mob of riffraff in the Borough Clink The Newgate Gang
were in due time taken not to Gravesend but straight away from the
Pool to Richmond in Virginia whereas I was conveyed to Gravesend and
Deal and shipped off to Jamaica in The Humane Hopwood And what do
you think was the object of this Humane Scoundrel in thus sequestrating
the Kings Pardon and robbing me of my liberty and perhaps of the
occasion of returning to the state of a Gentleman in which I was Born
Twas simply to kidnap me and make a wretched profit of twenty or
thirty poundsthe Commander of his Ship going him half in the
adventureby selling me in the West Indies where white boys not being
Transports were then much in demand to be brought up as clerks and
cashkeepers to the Planters Sure there was never such a Diabolical
Plot for so sorry an end but a vast number of paltry conspiracies
carried out with Infernal Cunning and Ingenuity had made in the course
of years Sir Basil Hopwood rich and mighty a Knight and Alderman
Parliament man and exLord Mayor To carry out these designs was just
part of the ordinary calling of a Shipmaster in those days Twas looked
upon as the simplest matter of business in the world To kidnap a child
was such an everyday deed of devilry that the slightest amount of pains
was deemed sufficing to conceal the abominable thing And thus the
Foreign Person saw with dolorous Eyes the convoy of convicts take their
departure from Newgate to ship on board the Virginian vessel at St
Katherines Stairs while poor little Jack Dangerous was being smuggled
away from Gravesend to Jamaica
And to Jamaica I should have gone to be sold as a Slave but for the
strange occurrence of the Captain taking a liking to me He dared not
have kept me among the convicts as the Sheriff at Port Royal would have
had a List in Duplicate of their names sent out by a fastsailing Kings
Ship for the Government at Home had some faint Suspicion of the
prevailing custom of Kidnapping and made some Feeble Attempts to stop
it But he would have kept me on board as a shipboy till the Auction of
the Transports was over and then he would have coolly sold me for as
much as I would fetch to some Merchant of Kingston or Port Royal who
was used to deal in flesh and blood and who in due course would have
transferred me at a profit to some upcountry planter
But that shall never be Jack my hearty Captain Handsell exclaimed
when after many more pipes of Tobacco and rummers of Punch he had
explained these wonderful things to me I shall lose my half share in
