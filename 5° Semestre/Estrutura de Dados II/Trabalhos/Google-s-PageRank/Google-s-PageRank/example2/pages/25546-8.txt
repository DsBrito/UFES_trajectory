The lonely sunsets flare forlorn
Down valleys dreadly desolate
The lordly mountains soar in scorn
As still as death as stern as fate
The lonely sunsets flame and die
The giant valleys gulp the night
The monster mountains scrape the sky
Where eager stars are diamondbright
So gaunt against the gibbous moon
Piercing the silence velvetpiled
A lone wolf howls his ancient rune
The fell archspirit of the Wild
O outcast land O leper land
Let the lone wolfcry all express
The hate insensate of thy hand
Thy hearts abysmal loneliness

THE LAW OF THE YUKON
This is the law of the Yukon and ever she makes it plain
Send not your foolish and feeble send me your strong and your sane
Strong for the red rage of battle sane for I harry them sore
Send me men girt for the combat men who are grit to the core
Swift as the panther in triumph fierce as the bear in defeat
Sired of a bulldog parent steeled in the furnace heat
Send me the best of your breeding lend me your chosen ones
Them will I take to my bosom them will I call my sons
Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat
But the othersthe misfits the failuresI trample under my feet
Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain
Ye would send me the spawn of your guttersGo take back your spawn
again
Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway
From my ruthless throne I have ruled alone for a million years and a
day
Hugging my mighty treasure waiting for man to come
Till he swept like a turbid torrent and after him sweptthe scum
The pallid pimp of the deadline the enervate of the pen
One by one I weeded them out for all that I sought wasMen
One by one I dismayed them frighting them sore with my glooms
One by one I betrayed them unto my manifold dooms
Drowned them like rats in my rivers starved them like curs on my
plains
Rotted the flesh that was left them poisoned the blood in their veins
Burst with my winter upon them searing forever their sight
Lashed them with funguswhite faces whimpering wild in the night
Staggering blind through the stormwhirl stumbling mad through the
snow
Frozen stiff in the ice pack brittle and bent like a bow
Featureless formless forsaken scented by wolves in their flight
Left for the wind to make music through ribs that are glittering white
Gnawing the black crust of failure searching the pit of despair
Crooking the toe in the trigger trying to patter a prayer
Going outside with an escort raving with lips all afoam
Writing a cheque for a million drivelling feebly of home
Lost like a louse in the burning  or else in tented town
Seeking a drunkards solace sinking and sinking down
Steeped in the slime at the bottom dead to a decent world
Lost mid the human flotsam far on the frontier hurled
In the camp at the bend of the river with its dozen saloons aglare
Its gambling dens ariot its gramophones all ablare
Crimped with the crimes of a city sinridden and bridled with lies
In the hush of my mountained vastness in the flush of my midnight
skies
Plaguespots yet tools of my purpose so natheless I suffer them
thrive
Crushing my Weak in their clutches that only my Strong may survive
But the others the men of my mettle the men who would stablish
my fame
Unto its ultimate issue winning me honour not shame
Searching my uttermost valleys fighting each step as they go
Shooting the wrath of my rapids scaling my ramparts of snow
Ripping the guts of my mountains looting the beds of my creeks
Them will I take to my bosom and speak as a mother speaks
I am the land that listens I am the land that broods
Steeped in eternal beauty crystalline waters and woods
Long have I waited lonely shunned as a thing accurst
Monstrous moody pathetic the last of the lands and the first
Visioning campfires at twilight sad with a longing forlorn
Feeling my womb oerpregnant with the seed of cities unborn
Wild and wide are my borders stern as death is my sway
And I wait for the men who will win meand I will not be won in a day
And I will not be won by weaklings subtile suave and mild
But by men with the hearts of vikings and the simple faith of a child
Desperate strong and resistless unthrottled by fear or defeat
Them will I gild with my treasure them will I glut with my meat
Lofty I stand from each sister land patient and wearily wise
With the weight of a world of sadness in my quiet passionless eyes
Dreaming alone of a people dreaming alone of a day
When men shall not rape my riches and curse me and go away
Making a bawd of my bounty fouling the hand that gave
Till I rise in my wrath and I sweep on their path and I stamp them
into a grave
Dreaming of men who will bless me of women esteeming me good
Of children born in my borders of radiant motherhood
Of cities leaping to stature of fame like a flag unfurled
As I pour the tide of my riches in the eager lap of the world
This is the Law of the Yukon that only the Strong shall thrive
That surely the Weak shall perish and only the Fit survive
Dissolute damned and despairful crippled and palsied and slain
This is the Will of the YukonLo how she makes it plain
THE PARSONS SON
This is the song of the parsons son as he squats in his shack alone
On the wild weird nights when the Northern Lights shoot up from the
frozen zone
And its sixty below and couched in the snow the hungry huskies moan
Im one of the Arctic brotherhood Im an oldtime pioneer
I came with the firstO God how Ive cursed this Yukonbut still
Im here
Ive sweated athirst in its summer heat Ive frozen and starved in
its cold
Ive followed my dreams by its thousand streams Ive toiled and
moiled for its gold
Look at my eyesbeen snowblind twice look where my foots half
gone
And that gruesome scar on my left cheek where the frostfiend bit to
the bone
Each one a brand of this devils land where Ive played and Ive
lost the game
A broken wreck with a craze for hooch and never a cent to my name
This mining is only a gamble the worst is as good as the best
I was in with the bunch and I might have come out right on top with
the rest
With Cormack Ladue and MacdonaldO God but its hell to think
Of the thousands and thousands Ive squandered on cards and women
and drink
In the early days we were just a few and we hunted and fished around
Nor dreamt by our lonely campfires of the wealth that lay under the
ground
We traded in skins and whiskey and Ive often slept under the shade
Of that lone birchtree on Bonanza where the first big find was made
We were just like a great big family and every man had his squaw
And we lived such a wild free fearless life beyond the pale of the
law
Till sudden there came a whisper and it maddened us every man
And I got in on Bonanza before the big rush began
Oh those Dawson days and the sin and the blaze and the town all
open wide
If God made me in His likeness sure He let the devil inside
But we all were mad both the good and the bad and as for the
women well
No spot on the map in so short a space has hustled more souls to hell
Money was just like dirt there easy to get and to spend
I was all caked in on a dancehall jade but she shook me in the end
It put me queer and for near a year I never drew sober breath
Till I found myself in the bughouse ward with a claim staked out on
death
Twenty years in the Yukon struggling along its creeks
Roaming its giant valleys scaling its godlike peaks
Bathed in its fiery sunsets fighting its fiendish cold
Twenty years in the Yukon  twenty yearsand Im old
Old and weak but no matter theres hooch in the bottle still
Ill hitch up the dogs tomorrow and mush down the trail to Bill
Its so long dark and Im lonesomeIll just lay down on the bed
Tomorrow Ill go  tomorrow  I guess Ill play on the red
Come Kit your pony is saddled Im waiting dear in the
court
Minnie you devil Ill kill you if you skip with that flossy
sport
How much does it go to the pan Bill play up School and
play the game
Our Father which art in heaven hallowed be Thy name
This was the song of the parsons son as he lay in his bunk alone
Ere the fire went out and the cold crept in and his blue lips
ceased to moan
And the hungermaddened malamutes had torn him flesh from bone
THE SPELL OF THE YUKON
I wanted the gold and I sought it
I scrabbled and mucked like a slave
Was it famine or scurvyI fought it
I hurled my youth into the grave
I wanted the gold and I got it
Came out with a fortune last fall
Yet somehow lifes not what I thought it
And somehow the gold isnt all
No Theres the land Have you seen it
Its the cussedest land that I know
From the big dizzy mountains that screen it
To the deep deathlike valleys below
Some say God was tired when He made it
Some say its a fine land to shun
Maybe but theres some as would trade it
For no land on earthand Im one
You come to get rich damned good reason
You feel like an exile at first
You hate it like hell for a season
And then you are worse than the worst
It grips you like some kinds of sinning
It twists you from foe to a friend
It seems its been since the beginning
It seems it will be to the end
Ive stood in some mightymouthed hollow
Thats plumbfull of hush to the brim
Ive watched the big husky sun wallow
In crimson and gold and grow dim
Till the moon set the pearly peaks gleaming
And the stars tumbled out neck and crop
And Ive thought that I surely was dreaming
With the peace o the world piled on top
The summerno sweeter was ever
The sunshiny woods all athrill
The grayling aleap in the river
The bighorn asleep on the hill
The strong life that never knows harness
The wilds where the caribou call
The freshness the freedom the farness
O God how Im stuck on it all
The winter the brightness that blinds you
The white land locked tight as a drum
The cold fear that follows and finds you
The silence that bludgeons you dumb
The snows that are older than history
The woods where the weird shadows slant
The stillness the moonlight the mystery
Ive bade em goodbyebut I cant
Theres a land where the mountains are nameless
And the rivers all run God knows where
There are lives that are erring and aimless
And deaths that just hang by a hair
There are hardships that nobody reckons
There are valleys unpeopled and still
Theres a landoh it beckons and beckons
And I want to go backand I will
Theyre making my money diminish
Im sick of the taste of champagne
Thank God when Im skinned to a finish
Ill pike to the Yukon again
Ill fightand you bet its no shamfight
Its hellbut Ive been there before
And its better than this by a damsite
So me for the Yukon once more
Theres gold and its haunting and haunting
Its luring me on as of old
Yet it isnt the gold that Im wanting
So much as just finding the gold
Its the great big broad land way up yonder
Its the forests where silence has lease
Its the beauty that thrills me with wonder
Its the stillness that fills me with peace
THE CALL OF THE WILD
Have you gazed on naked grandeur where theres nothing else to gaze on
Set pieces and dropcurtain scenes galore
Big mountains heaved to heaven which the blinding sunsets blazon
Black canyons where the rapids rip and roar
Have you swept the visioned valley with the green stream streaking
through it
Searched the Vastness for a something you have lost
Have you strung your soul to silence Then for Gods sake go and do it
Hear the challenge learn the lesson pay the cost
Have you wandered in the wilderness the sagebrush desolation
The bunchgrass levels where the cattle graze
Have you whistled bits of ragtime at the end of all creation
And learned to know the deserts little ways
Have you camped upon the foothills have you galloped oer the ranges
Have you roamed the arid sunlands through and through
Have you chummed up with the mesa Do you know its moods and changes
Then listen to the wildits calling you
Have you known the Great White Silence not a snowgemmed twig
aquiver
Eternal truths that shame our soothing lies
Have you broken trail on snowshoes mushed your huskies up the river
Dared the unknown led the way and clutched the prize
Have you marked the maps void spaces mingled with the mongrel races
Felt the savage strength of brute in every thew
And though grim as hell the worst is can you round it off with curses
Then hearken to the wildits wanting you
Have you suffered starved and triumphed grovelled down yet
grasped at glory
Grown bigger in the bigness of the whole
Done things just for the doing letting babblers tell the story
Seeing through the nice veneer the naked soul
Have you seen God in His splendours heard the text that nature
renders
Youll never hear it in the family pew
The simple things the true things the silent men who do things
Then listen to the wildits calling you
They have cradled you in custom they have primed you with their
preaching
They have soaked you in convention through and through
They have put you in a showcase youre a credit to their teaching
But cant you hear the wildits calling you
Let us probe the silent places let us seek what luck betide us
Let us journey to a lonely land I know
Theres a whisper on the nightwind theres a star agleam to guide us
And the wild is calling calling  let us go
THE LONE TRAIL
Ye who know the Lone Trail fain would follow it
Though it lead to glory or the darkness of the pit
Ye who take the Lone Trail bid your love goodbye
The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow till you die
The trails of the world be countless and most of the trails be tried
You tread on the heels of the many till you come where the ways
divide
And one lies safe in the sunlight and the other is dreary and wan
Yet you look aslant at the Lone Trail and the Lone Trail lures you on
And somehow youre sick of the highway with its noise and its easy
needs
And you seek the risk of the byway and you reck not where it leads
And sometimes it leads to the desert and the tongue swells out of
the mouth
And you stagger blind to the mirage to die in the mocking drouth
And sometimes it leads to the mountain to the light of the lone
campfire
And you gnaw your belt in the anguish of hungergoaded desire
And sometimes it leads to the Southland to the swamp where the
orchid glows
And you rave to your grave with the fever and they rob the corpse
for its clothes
And sometimes it leads to the Northland and the scurvy softens your
bones
And your flesh dints in like putty and you spit out your teeth like
stones
And sometimes it leads to a coral reef in the wash of a weedy sea
And you sit and stare at the empty glare where the gulls wait greedily
And sometimes it leads to an Arctic trail and the snows where your
torn feet freeze
And you whittle away the useless clay and crawl on your hands and
knees
Often it leads to the deadpit always it leads to pain
By the bones of your brothers ye know it but oh to follow youre
fain
By your bones they will follow behind you till the ways of the
world are made plain
Bid goodbye to sweetheart bid goodbye to friend
The Lone Trail the Lone Trail follow to the end
Tarry not and fear not chosen of the true
Lover of the Lone Trail the Lone Trail waits for you
THE HEART OF THE SOURDOUGH
There where the mighty mountains bare their fangs unto the moon
There where the sullen sundogs glare in the snowbright bitter noon
And the glaciergutted streams sweep down at the clarion call of June
There where the livid tundras keep their tryst with the tranquil snows
There where the Silences are spawned and the light of hellfire flows
Into the bowl of the midnight sky violet amber and rose
There where the rapids churn and roar and the icefloes bellowing run
Where the tortured twisted rivers of blood rush to the setting sun
Ive packed my kit and Im going boys ere another day is done
I knew it would call or soon or late as it calls the whirring wings
Its the olden lure its the golden lure its the lure of the
timeless things
And tonight O God of the trails untrod how it whines in my
heartstrings
Im sick to death of your wellgroomed gods your makebelieve and
your show
I long for a whiff of bacon and beans a snug shakedown in the snow
A trail to break and a life at stake and another bout with the foe
With the rawribbed Wild that abhors all life the wild that would
crush and rend
I have clinched and closed with the naked North I have learned to
defy and defend
Shoulder to shoulder weve fought it outyet the Wild must win in
the end
I have flouted the Wild I have followed its lure fearless
familiar alone
By all that the battle means and makes I claim that land for mine own
Yet the Wild must win and a day will come when I shall be overthrown
Then when as wolfdogs fight weve fought the lean wolfland and I
Fought and bled till the snows are red under the reeling sky
Even as lean wolfdog goes down will I go down and die
THE THREE VOICES
The waves have a story to tell me
As I lie on the lonely beach
Chanting aloft in the pinetops
The wind has a lesson to teach
But the stars sing an anthem of glory
I cannot put into speech
The waves tell of ocean spaces
Of hearts that are wild and brave
Of populous city places
Of desolate shores they lave
Of men who sally in quest of gold
To sink in an ocean grave
The wind is a mighty roamer
He bids me keep me free
Clean from the taint of the goldlust
Hardy and pure as he
Cling with my love to nature
As a child to the motherknee
But the stars throng out in their glory
And they sing of the God in man
They sing of the mighty Master
Of the loom His fingers span
Where a star or a soul is a part of the whole
And weft in the wondrous plan
Here by the campfires flicker
Deep in my blanket curled
I long for the peace of the pinegloom
When the scroll of the Lord is unfurled
And the wind and the wave are silent
And world is singing to world
THE PINES
We sleep in the sleep of ages the bleak barbarian pines
The grey moss drapes us like sages and closer we lock our lines
And deeper we clutch through the gelid gloom where never a sunbeam
shines
On the flanks of the stormgored ridges are our black battalions
massed
We surge in a host to the sullen coast and we sing in the ocean blast
From empire of sea to empire of snow we grip our empire fast
To the niggard lands were we driven twixt desert and foe are we
penned
To us was the Northland given ours to stronghold and defend
Ours till the world be riven in the crash of the utter end
Ours from the bleak beginning through the ons of deathlike sleep
Ours from the shock when the naked rock was hurled from the hissing
deep
Ours through the twilight ages of weary glaciercreep
Wind of the East wind of the West wandering to and fro
Chant your songs in our topmost boughs that the sons of men may know
The peerless pine was the first to come and the pine will be last
to go
We pillar the halls of perfumed gloom we plume where the eagles soar
The Northwind swoops from the brooding Pole and our ancients crash
and roar
But where one falls from the crumbling walls shoots up a hardy score
We spring from the gloom of the canyons womb in the valleys lap
we lie
From the white foamfringe where the breakers cringe to the peaks
that tusk the sky
We climb and we peer in the craglocked mere that gleams like a
golden eye
Gain to the verge of the hogback ridge where the vision ranges free
Pines and pines and the shadow of pines as far as the eye can see
A steadfast legion of stalwart knights in dominant empery
Sun moon and stars give answer shall we not staunchly stand
Even as now forever wards of the wilder strand
Sentinels of the stillness lords of the last lone land
THE HARPY
There was a woman and she was wise woefully wise was she
She was old so old yet her years all told were but a score and three
And she knew by heart from finish to start the Book of Iniquity
There is no hope for such as I on earth nor yet in Heaven
Unloved I live unloved I die unpitied unforgiven
A loathed jade I ply my trade unhallowed and unshriven
I paint my cheeks for they are white and cheeks of chalk men hate
Mine eyes with wine I make to shine that men may seek and sate
With overhead a lamp of red I sit me down and wait
Until they come the nightly scum with drunken eyes aflame
Your sweethearts sons ye scornful onestis I who know their shame
The gods ye see are brutes to meand so I play my game
For life is not the thing we thought and not the thing we plan
And woman in a bitter world must do the best she can
Must yield the stroke and bear the yoke and serve the will of man
Must serve his need and ever feed the flame of his desire
Though be she loved for love alone or be she loved for hire
For every man since life began is tainted with the mire
And though you know he love you so and set you on loves throne
Yet let your eyes but mock his sighs and let your heart be stone
Lest you be left as I was left attainted and alone
From loves close kiss to hells abyss is one sheer flight I trow
And weddingring and bridal bell are willowisps of woe
And tis not wise to love too well and this all women know
Wherefore the wolfpack having gorged upon the lamb their prey
With siren smile and serpent guile I make the wolfpack pay
With velvet paws and flensing claws a tigress roused to slay
One who in youth sought truest truth and found a devils lies
A symbol of the sin of man a human sacrifice
Yet shall I blame on man the shame Could it be otherwise
Was I not born to walk in scorn where others walk in pride
