THRILLS FROM THE TERMINI
Mr Punch following the example of his daily contemporaries despatched
a representative to some of the great London termini to note the August
exodus from town The following thrilling report is to hand
At Waterton and Paddingloo great crowds continued to board the limited
number of Westbound and Southwestbound trains On being asked why
they were leaving town those of the travellers who answered at all said
it was the regular time for their annual holiday and they wanted a
change They were mostly a jolly hearty lot happily confident that at
some time in the course of the next fortyeight hours they would be
deposited in some part of the West or Southwest of England Those
fortunate persons who had secured seats were sitting down those who
were unable to get seats were standing and in spite of the congested
state of the carriages and corridors almost all were smiling the
exceptions being those highlystrung and excitable passengers who had
come to blows over corner seats and windows up or down Many of the
travellers carried baskets of food Your representative anxious to
report on the quality and quantity of the provisions carried ventured
to peep into one of the baskets and was in consequence involved in a
rather unpleasant affair being actually accused of having abstracted a
sandwich
The enginedriver questioned as to whether he liked having passengers
on the engine and whether he considered it safe for them was understood
to say that so long as they didnt get in his way it didnt matter to
him and as to its being safe for them he jolly well didnt care
whether it was safe for them or not The guard detained by the sleeve
by your representative who inquired how he felt about being almost
crowded out of his brake by passengers drew away his sleeve with some
violence and his answer was quite unworthy to be reported An elderly
but stronglybuilt porter with the luggage of fourteen families on his
truck and the fourteen families surrounding him and all talking at
once was approached by your representative for a little quiet chat but
he became so threatening that it was thought advisable to leave him
alone
At Ticvoria Station your representative found a seething mob intent on
getting to those ever popular and already much overcrowded Southcoast
resorts Paradeville ShingletononSea Promenade Bay etc The
elevenoclock Paradeville fast due to start in halfanhour was at
No 20 platform All sitting and standing room had been occupied for
some hours and the passengers were enjoying the sport of seeing the
later arrivals running the whole length of the train and back again in
the mad hope of finding places Your representative managed to get a
word with some of these later arrivals and asked them how they liked
running up and down and whether they were much disappointed at not
finding room but the answers were mostly unsatisfactory and in some
cases uncivil The bookingclerk questioned as to the phraseology
employed by August holiday folk in asking for their tickets whether it
is Third return please or Third return or Third return and look
sharp showed by his answer that the expression please is falling
into desuetude on these occasions his exact words being Theres
precious little please knocking about and anyone who has the cheek to
tell me to look sharp is jolly well kept waiting till the last Your
representative wishing to report at firsthand the experience of those
who were travelling thirty in a compartment meant to accommodate ten in
the Paradeville fast tried to get in and make a thirtyfirst
explaining that it was only for a minute and was with the object of
getting local colour but was forcibly expelled and falling on the
platform and sustaining some slight contusions decided to cease
reporting on August scenes at the great termini for that day
TWO DUMB WARRIORS
IHYLDEBRAND
When the Heatherdale Hussars received a twohours notice to trek
they of course dumped their mascot Hyldebrand a sixmonthsold wild
boar at the Town Majors They would have done the same with a baby or
a fullgrown hippopotamus The harassed TM discovered Hyldebrand in
the next stable to his slightly hysterical horse the morning after the
HH had evacuated and informed me his village Sanitary Inspector
that as I was fond of animals he had seen me distributing flytraps
and painting horsetrough noticeboards I was henceforth in sole
command of Hyldebrand until such time as his owners should reclaim him
A grant of five sous per diem had been left for the piglettes
maintenance
I took charge of Hyldebrand provided an old dogkennel for his shelter
an older dogcollar for his adornment and six yards of flex for his
restraint I further appointed the runnera youth from Huddersfield
nicknamed Isinglass in playful sarcastic comment on his speedsecond
in command He was to feed groom and exercise Hyldebrand I would
inspect Hyldebrand twice a week
Hyldebrand rose fast in village popularity One forgot that his parents
had been shot for cattle maiming body snatching breaking into
granaries and defying the gendarmerie on the public roads But Hyldy was
all docility He ate his way through the grant the office stationery
and the central tin dump with the most disarming naivete He was the
spoilt darling of every mess The reflected glory which Isinglass and
myself enjoyed was positively embarrassing
But as the summer advanced so did Hyldebrand He became to quote his
keeper a battle pig with the head of a pantomime dragon
forequarters of a bison the hindlegs of a deer and a back like an
heraldic scrubbingbrush In March I had inspected him as he sat upon my
knee In June I shook hands with him as he strained at his tether In
midSeptember we nodded to each other from opposite sides of a barbed
wire fence Yet Isinglass retained the most complete mastery of his
ferociouslooking protege and beneath his skilful massage Hyldebrand
would throw himself upon the ground and guggle in a porcine ecstacy
One sunny afternoon when there had come upon the little village street
the inevitable hush which preceded Hyldebrands hour for exercise I
espied the village cripple making for his home with the celerity of an A
1 man He glared reproachfully at me and with an exclamation of
Sacre sanglier vanished in the open doorway of the local
boulangerie that being nearer than his cottage Then came Hyldebrand
froth on his snout and murder in his little eyes and after him
Isinglass more than living up to his equine namesake I joined him and
following Hyldy in a cloud of dust the runner informed me between gasps
that it was along of burning his snoutraking for a bullybeef tin in
the insinuator
A band outside B Mess was nearing the climax of GRIEGS Peer Gynt
suite Hyldebrand just failed to perpetrate the timeworn gag of jumping
through the big drum but he contrived to make that final crashing chord
sound like the last sneeze of a giant dying of hayfever The rest the
crowd saw through a film of dust Hyldebrand headed for the turning by
the school reached it as the gates opened to release young France and
comedy would have turned to tragedy but for the point duty MP and his
revolver
There was a note and a parcel for me a day or so after The note which
was addressed to and had been opened by the TM stated that Hyldebrand
was being sent for by the Heatherdale Hussars on the morrow Outside the
parcel was scrawled above the initials of the GHQ officers cook a
friend of mine Its top holetry it with a drop of sauce Inside was
a cold pork chop

MR LLOYD GEORGE LUCKY RHONDDA BUT I TAUGHT HIM THOSE NUMBERS
IIERMYNTRUDE
It so happened in a quiet part of the line that men were scarce and work
abundant so it was decided to use mules to carry the rations further
than usual All went well until one night when friend Fritz changed his
habits and put some assorted fireworks rather near the mules
Now the transport being human and moreover unaccustomed to fireworks
disliked this entertainment Therefore they sought what shelter they
could In a few minutes the Hun repented but no mules and no rations
could the transport see Moreover it began to rain So back they went
and spoke at great length of the hundreds of seventeeninch which had
blown up all the mules
The morning began to come and a machinegun subaltern looking at a
black East in search of daylight so that he might say It is now
light I may go to bed was somewhat startled For he said I have
received shocks as the result of too much whisky of old but from a
split tea and chloride of limeno It must be the pork and beans
However he collected eight puzzled but peaceful mules and handed them
to a still more bewildered adjutant who knew not if they were trench
stores or articles to be returned to salvage
In the meanwhile the Transport Officer was making inquiries and he
recovered the eight mules All he said are back except Ermyntrude
I grieve for Ermyntrude but still more for my drivers fate
Where Ermyntrude spent the day no one knows All that is known is of her
conduct the next night About eleven oclock she stepped on a shelter
and being a heavy mule came into the trench abruptly This worried but
did not hurt her and she proceeded down the trench at a steady trot
bumping into the traverses She met a ration party and for the first
time in their lives they took refuge over the top for Ermyntrude was
angry
Ermyntrude reached the end of the trench and somehow got out heading
by chance for Germany That was her undoing In a minute or so three
machineguns began firing bombs and rifle shots were heard and Verey
lights innumerable flared We never saw Ermyntrude again But we heard
of heror rather we read of herfor the German official report wrote
her epitaph thus Near the village of  hostile raiding detachments
were repulsed by our machinegun fire

LXIV
MY DEAR CHARLESSince I last wrote to you I have enjoyed
seeing again an officer with whom I had many curious dealings in
the past and who if half the facts he divulges about himself
were true would certainly be the wickedest Colonel in the
BEF notwithstanding that he fought busily in the early
stages and had the best part of himself knocked out in so doing
He has performed many strange duties since and the steps he
took to qualify for one of them will I think illustrate for
you his wickedness
It has been found on experience that modesty is out of place
when you are being called upon to state your qualifications for
a post The knowing upon being asked if they possess certain
attributes reply in an immediate affirmative and add others
just to be on the safe side It is felt that what is really
required in this War is thrust and ingenuity things which
adequately make up for the absence of any specialist knowledge
Accordingly my friend found himself described as possessing
among other things French fluent It was not until he was
informed that the Official Interpreter would like to hear a
little of this that he looked more closely into the matter and
discovered that he knew no French at all Undismayed he spent
the two days interval before the vivavoce examination in
learning some You might suppose that two days is a short time
in which to become so familiar with a strange language that you
may be able to understand and answer any question which may be
put to you in it Sly friend however did not let this worry
him He learnt by heart a long and detailed narrative embracing
all the most impressive idioms and all the most popular slang
the subject of which was an accident which had occurred to him
in the earlier days of the campaign a long and a vivid story
which once started would last indefinitely and could not be
interrupted meanwhile
Armed with no other knowledge of the French language than this
my friend duly presented himself before the Official
Interpreter greeted him with a genial salute and waited
throughout his opening speech which was in French and contained
many inquiries
My friend made no endeavour to follow these simple questions He
knew he couldnt succeed and had no intention of giving himself
away by an attempt Advancing towards the Interpreters table
and putting his right hand to his ear Pardon monsieur he
said mais je suis un peu sourd depuis mon accident
Quel accident said the Interpreter after which my friend did
not stop talking until he was passed out with a French
garrulous
We met quite recently and talked over things in general telling
each other in confidence and on the best authority all those
exciting details of the progress of the War which men go on
saying and believing until they are officially contradicted
Getting down to realities he told me that he has now the
greatest difficulty in believing in the War at all though he is
within earshot of it all the time His difficulty is due to the
last thing he saw before he left his office three men standing
at his gate in that attitude of contented and contemplative
leisure which one associates with Saturday afternoons and
village pumps looking at nothing in particular and spitting
thoughtfully as occasion required One of them was a British
soldier one a French soldier and one a German soldier The
whole picture suggested anything but war if there was a war on
which nation was fighting against which My friend however is
somewhat oddly situated in this respect since he commands for
the moment a detachment of German prisoners in our back area
Some of them he tells me are extraordinarily smart One
Prussian NCO in particular was remarkable Dressed in his
impressive overcoat hatted for all the world like our Staff and
carrying under his arm his dapper cane this NCO went round
from group to group of working prisoners accompanying the
English sergeant in charge of the party and interpreting the
latters orders to the men So striking was his getup that all
paused to look at him
Thinking it might please you my friend showed me an official
memo which he had just received from one of his officers in
command of an outlying detachment and of course of the odds and
ends of British personnel adhering thereto cooks guards etc
The memo ran as follows and it repays careful study and
thinking out I give you the whole of it
To the Commanding Officer Orderly Room Hqrs
The undermentioned is in my opinion entirely unfitted
for the duty to which he has been detailed with this
detachment He shows no signs of either intelligence or
industry and I propose with your approval to take the
necessary steps to get rid of him forthwith
A B SMITH
Capt ic B Detachment
My friend was much concerned to hit upon exactly the right form
of reply Eventually we agreed
To Capt A B Smith ic B Detachment
Goodbye
C D JONES
LtCol OC etc etc
Finally let me tell you a disgraceful tale of my same friend
which does not refer to his present command and is I hope
untrue of him in any command
The crowd for which he was then responsible was suddenly
threatened with inspection by the General who is charged with
the welfare of such people and who very properly desired to
satisfy himself that they were both well disciplined and well
tended So that success might be assured my friend had a
rehearsal parade All inspections and manoeuvres being
completed my friend stood the crowd at ease and thus addressed
them
All ranks will take the utmost care to turn themselves
out smartly for the inspection and to make the
inspection a success As the General passes along the
lines inspecting you you will stand rigidly to
attention eyes front You will be asked if you have any
complaints to make and each of you will have an
opportunity of making a complaint in the correct manner
In making his complaint the man should advance two
paces forward salute smartly stand to attention and
make his complaint
And by Heavens if anybody does
Yours ever

A TRACT FOR GROUSERS
Ernest and I were seated by the river It was very pleasant there and
it seemed a small thing to us that we were both still disabled
Did you ever say to yourself when you were out there that if ever you
got out of it alive youd never grumble at anything again said
Ernest
My reply was in the affirmative
We were silent for a while remorse weighing heavily upon us
The worst case said Ernest at length was when I got my commission
and came home for my kit
I composed myself to listen piously determined not to grumble however
tedious I might find his recital
Wed been near a place called Ypres he began
I seem to have heard the name I murmured
I hadnt been sleeping really well for a weekwed been in the
trenches that timeand before that I had lain somewhat uneasily upon a
concrete floor
Yes concrete is hard isnt it I said
We came out at three in the morning and arrived at our billets about
seven I knew this commission was on the tapisFrench word meaning
carpetso I hung round not daring to turn in At eleven oclock I had
orders to push off home to get my kit Youll guess I didnt want asking
twice I made my way to the railhead at once in case of any hitch and
had to wait some time for a train It was a goods train when it came
but it did quite well and deposited me outside the port of embarkation
about nine oclock at night I walked on into the port and found the
ship that was crossing next morning I went below in search of a cabin
There was a French sailor there to whom I explained my need
How I asked for I do not share Ernests opinion of his mastery of
the French language but he ignored this
It was dark down there he went on too dark for him to see that I
was in a privates uniform so I put on a bit of side and he took me for
an officer
A French officer
Very likely Anyway he found me a beautiful cabin with a lovely couch
in it all covered with plush You would have thought I should want
nothing but to be left to sleep but no I saw that the officer in the
next cabin had a candle and there was no candle for me Instantly my
worst instincts were aroused I felt I was being put upon I demanded a
candle The sailor declared there wasnt one left
Youre sure he understood what you were asking for
Yes I know that candle is boogy thank you I argued with him for ten
minutes and then turned in grumbling Queer wasnt it
Yes I said
I sat there for a while thinking over Ernests story which had it
seemed to me something of the tract about it
Later the midges began to attack us
Arent these midges absolutely I began and then stopped
remembering Ernests tract It only shows as I said to Ernest that we
may learn something even from the most unlikely people

Royal Highness
The CP You can lay out the best I havethe one of the Deaths Head
Hussars with all my stars and medals I am expecting an important
visit
Fritz with a meaning smile If I might venture so far I would
suggest to his Royal Highness that he should wear the Trench uniform
which I arranged with the bulletholes and the mudsplashes It creates
a greater effect especially if the visitor be a lady
The CP Fritz you dog how dare you Very well have it your own way
and let it be the Trench uniform
Fritz I am only anxious to promote his Royal Highnesss interest in
every possible way
The CP I know I know Only we shall have old HINDENBURG growling
and grunting and looking as black as a thundercloud I cannot imagine
what my revered father sees in that old wooden effigy whose only idea
of strategy is to retreat from strong positions That at any rate is
not the fashion in which I have learnt war Im thoroughly tired of
hearing of all these HINDENBURG plans which come to nothing
Fritz Your Royal Highness is of course right But what I say to
myself is that the ALLHIGHEST your Royal Highnesss most gracious
father has in all this a deeplaid design to show conclusively that all
these HINDENBURG plans mean nothing so that in the end true skill and
merit may have a chance and the chief command may be placed in the only
hands that are fit to exercise it Oh yes I know what Im talking
about and everyone I meet says the same
The CP I have always felt that that must be so No matter a time
will come By the way Fritz have you packed up the Sevres
dinnerservice
Fritz I have already packed six from as many different French and
Belgian houses and have sent them to Berlin according to your Royal
Highnesss directions Which does your Royal Highness refer to
The CP I mean the one with the simple pattern of pink flowers and
the coatofarms
Fritz Yes that I have packed like the rest and have sent off
The CP And the silver dishes and the lace
Fritz Yes they have all gone
The CP Good And the clocks
Fritz Yes I did in every case what your Royal Highness ordered me to
do
The CP And you packed them I hope with the greatest care
Fritz I did nothing I am certain will suffer damage
The CP Excellent War is no doubt a rough and brutal affair but
at least it cannot be said that we Prussians do not behave like
gentlemen
Fritz Your Royal Highness speaks as always the plain truth How
different from the degenerate French and the intolerable English
The CP Yes Fritz and now you can go Stay there was something I
wanted to ask you Dear me I am losing my memory Ah I have it How is
my offensive getting on Has any news come in from the Chemin des
Dames
Fritz Your Royal Highnesss offensive has not advanced to any great
extent The French last night recaptured all their positions and even
penetrated into ours
The CP Did they How very annoying Somebody bungled of course
Well well I shall have to put it right when I have time Have you
finished laying out my uniform Yes Then you can go
THE HUMILIATION OF THE PALFREY
Where is she now the pride of the battalion
That ambled always at the Colonels side
A fair white steed like some majestic galleon
Which takes deliberate the harbour tide
So soft so slow she scarcely seems to stir
And that indeed was very true of her
Who was till late so kind her character
The only horse the Adjutant could ride
Ever she led the regiment on its journeys
And held sweet converse with the Colonels gee
Of knights no doubt and old heroic tourneys
And how she bare great ladies oer the lea
And on high hillsides when the men felt dead
Far up the height they viewed her at the head
A star of hope and shook themselves and said
If she can do it dammit so can we
But where is now my Adjutantial palfrey
In front no longer but in rear today
Behind the bicycles and not at all free
To be familiar with the Generals gray
She walks in shame with all those misanthropes
The sad packanimals who have no hopes
But must by men be led about on ropes
Condemned till death to carry SAA
And bombs and beef and officers valises
And I at eve have marked my wistful mare
By thronging dumps where cursing never ceases
And rations come for oft she brings them there
Patient aloof and when the shrapnel droppd
And the young mules complained and kicked and hoppd
She only stood unmoved with one leg proppd
As if she heard it not or did not care
Or heard maybe but hoped to get a Blighty
For on her past she lately seemed to brood
And dreamed herself once more among the mighty
By grooms beloved and reverently shoed
But now she has no standing in the corps
And Death itself would hardly be a bore
