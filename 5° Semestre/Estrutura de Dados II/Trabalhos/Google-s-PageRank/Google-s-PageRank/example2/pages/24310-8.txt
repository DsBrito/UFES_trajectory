Long and low that house was and very old You could tell the great age
of it by the thickness of the thatch as well as by seeing when you
were standing inside upon the kitchen floor and looking up that that
same thatch was resting not upon common planks sawn with the grain and
against the grain and every way but upon the real boughs themselves
put there by them that had to choose carefully what would be suitable
for their purpose because there were few tools then for shaping timber
So thats how the branches were there yet the same as ever bark and
twigs and all ay and as sound as the day they were put there two
hundred years before
As for the walls at Moloneys  mud Im not denying it but the
thickness of them and the way they were kept whitewashed inside and
out Theyd dazzle you to look at them especially in the kitchen of an
evening when the fire would be strong And that was a thing that
occurred mostly always at Moloneys For Herself was a most notorious
Vanithee and theres no better sign of good housekeeping than a clean
blazing hearth Sure isnt that as a body might say the heart of the
whole house Heart or hearth isnt it all the one thing nearly For if
warmth and comfort for the body come from the one doesnt love and
pleasant kindness come from the other Ay indeed
And now here was the Christmas Eve come round again when every one
puts the best foot foremost whether they can or not And so by
Moloneys The darkness had fallen and a wild wet night it was as
ever came out of the heavens But that only made the light seem the
brighter and more coaxing that the fire was sending out over the
halfdoor and through the little twinkling bullseyes windows as if
it was trying to say Come along in whoever you are thats outside in
the cold and the rain Look at the way the Woman has the floor swept
till there isnt a speck upon it and the tables and stools scoured like
the snow and the big old pewter plates and dishes upon the dresser
polished till theyre shining like a goats eyes from under a bed Come
in Sure every one is welcome here tonight whether they come or not
And still in all
Well one look round would tell you with half an eye that something
was wrong at Moloneys Christmas Eve and all as it was For Big Michael
himself was standing there in the kitchen cracking his red wet fingers
one after the other and looking most uncomfortable The wet was running
down from his big frieze coat but it wasnt that he minded He was too
well used to soft weather to care about wet clothes Beside him upon the
floor was the big marketbasket with all manner of paper parcels blue
and brown sticking out from under the lid that wouldnt shut down he
had brought home so much from Melias shop But that basket had a
forgotten look about it because there beside it stood Herself and she
not asking to unpack it or do a thing with it She was a little bit of a
woman that youd think you could blow off the palm of your hand with
one puff of your breath As thin as a whip she was and as straight as a
rush and she was looking up now at Michael with flaming cheeks and eyes
like troubled waters
No letter she was saying and is it that you brought home no letter
after you being to the post Sure it cant be but they wrote to say were
they coming or not after they being asked here for the Christmas Sure
I thought youd surely have word to say when to expect them and was
thinking even that they might be coming with yourself Only I suppose
the little ass and dray wouldnt be grand enough for the wife Of coorse
I didnt think of her writing she may know no better and isnt to be
blemt if she has no manners she cant help the way she was brought up
But Art Sure there must be a letter from him
Wait and Ill try again said Big Michael slowly and then he took to
feel through his pockets again for the letter their son was to have sent
them But when he had done this he could only shake his head so that
the raindrops fell from his hair and beardturning brackety grey they
were Michael being on in years
No in trath not as much as one letter have I this night he said
slowly
At this the Woman began to laugh in spite of the great annoyance that
was on her
Sure she said if Mrs Melia had a letter for us wouldnt she have
given it to you What use would she have for it And if she hadnt
and told you so wheres the sense in you feeling your pockets over and
over A bodyd think you expected letters to grow there the same as
American apples in barrels How could you have there what you didnt put
there But let you go on off ouer this now Look at the state you have
the clean floor in with the rain dreeping from your cotamor
Coming down it is like as if it was out of a sieve said Michael
and wasnt it God that done it that I took the notion to cut the
hollynivy while the day was someways fine afore I started off to the
shop Has it safe below  so Ill just go for it now the way we can
be settling out the Crib and all
Therell no hollynivy go up on these walls tonight if Im to be let
have a say in the business said Mrs Moloney Sich trash and
nonsense making mess and trouble for them that has plenty to do without
that And as for the Crib let it stop where it is
On the word she went back to her stool in the chimneycorner where she
always sat bolt upright and took up her knitting the same as if it
wasnt the Christmas Eve at all For Art their only child that
stocking was meant But her hands were shaking so much that she dropped
more stitches off the needles than she made and still she persevered
Big Michael looked at her for a bit very pitiful even opened his mouth
once as if he wanted to say something a nice silent person he was
very evengoing in himself But he must have thought better of it for
he only shook his head again and turned and went off out of the door
into the wild storm and darkness with the wind howling and threatening
all about the bog and countryside the shockingest ever you knew
And as soon as he was gone didnt the Woman throw down her knitting
and laid her head upon her knees and cried and cried till her blue
checky apron was like as if it was after being wrung out of a tub of
suds
Och Art shed cry isnt this the queer way for you to be going on
To say you never answered the letter that was wrote to you This very
day fiveandtwenty years you came here to us as lovely as a little
angel you were The grand big blue eyes of you and the way youd laugh
up at me and put out the little hand And you the only one ever God
sent us And never a word between us only when you took the notion to
go off to Dublin sure it near broke our hearts but what could we do
only give you our blessing And  and then hearing the good accounts
of the way you were going on But its the wife that done it all and
has him that changed Too grand she is no doubt for the likes of
us Och grand howareye no but not half good enough for Art He that
was always counted a choice boy by all that knew him And any word them
that saw the wife beyant in Dublin with him brought back was no great
things A poorlooking little scollop of a thing they tell me she is
and like as if shed have about as much iday of taking butter off a
churn or spinning a hank of yarn as a pig would have of a holiday
What opinion could any sensible body have of that kind of a wedding
without even a matchmaker to inquire into the thing to see was it
anyways suitable or not Och Art Art its little I thought this day
fiveandtwenty years the way the thing would be now
CHAPTER II
THE STABLE
While poor Mrs Moloney was fretting like this and it Christmas Eve and
all Big Michael was making his way through the wind and the sleety rain
to where he had his stable a piece off from the house It was
pitchdark so that he couldnt see his hand before his eyes if he held
it up but he had his lantern and anyway he knew his way about
blindfold But even in daylight you might pass by that stable ready
unless you knew it was there For it was very little and being roofed
with heather it looked only like a bit of the bog that had humped itself
up a bit higher than the rest
Poorlooking and small as it was Big Michael was very proud of that
stable He and Art had built it together just before Art leaving home
It was wanted to keep the little wad of hay or straw safe from the
weather as well as to shelter the cow of a hard night And after Art
had gone off to the Big Smoke and for no other reason only getting
restless as young hearts often do many and many a time Michael would
slope off to the stable and sit down there to take a draw of the pipe
and to wish he had his pleasant active young boy back at home again He
missed Art full as much as the mother and maybe more
In fact it was getting into a habit with Michael to go off to the
stable He had the best of a wife but still there were times when hed
wish to be with himself somewhere so that he could take his ease and
still not be feeling himself an annoyance to a busy woman Big Michael
himself the people said always looked as if he thought tomorrow would
do But the Woman that owned him was of a different way of thinking
always going at something So he got the fashion of keeping out of her
way
When he got to the stable this night a bit out of breath with the great
wind he took notice first of the cow and he saw that she was
comfortable plenty of straw to lie upon and plenty of fodder before
her So then he bethought him of the little ass that was outside under
the dray yet
Ill put her in too he thought Destroyed she is and quite weakly
with the wet like all donkeys God help them let alone the mud and
gutter shes after travelling through all that long ways from the shop
And carrit the things we were in need of too Ill let her stand here
near the cow A good dry bed Ill put under her and give her a grain of
oats to pet her heart Itll not go astray with her and she has it well
earned the creature
So he unyoked the ass and led her into the stable and rubbed down her
shaggy coat all dripping like his own clothes and fed her and watched
with a curious satisfaction the nice way like a lady that she took the
feed he put before her
Poor Winny he said rubbing a finger up and down her soft ears
manys the time Art laughed at you and said it was only one remove
from a wheelbarra to be driving you Linggerin Death is what he used
to call you But sure you do your best and if you were the fastest
horse ever won the Grand National you could do no more
He looked round then with a very satisfied feeling There he had them
the two poor animals that depended out of him but that served him and
his so well too had them safe and warm from the storm and rain
outside He swung the lantern to and fro so that he could see
everything that was in the stable One end of it was filled with hay and
straw The light gleamed here gleamed there upon the kind homely
plenty he had stored Then it fell upon a heap of something else
something that glistened from many points green and cheerful
The hollynivy Big Michael thought that I cut this morning and
has it here the way it would be handy to do out the place in greenery
against Art and the wife would be here Well well I wouldnt wish to
go against Herself and she so fretted but sure I might as well not
have cut it at all
He stood and stared at it very mournful in himself For the best part
of the Christmas to Michael was not the good feeding Herself always
provided though he could take his share of that as well as another
no but the holly and ivy and the Candle and the Crib and now she had
set her face against them all And it wouldnt be Christmas at all he
thought without them
A sudden thought came into his mind
Why cant I have it Christmas here he said to himself and not be
letting all these beautiful green branches go to waste Thats what Ill
do
And with that he laid down the lantern and began to decorate the
little stable He moved slowly but the work grew under his hands He
put the bright glistening holly in the rack that the cow fed from and
over the door And he flung the long curving trails of ivy over the
rafters so that they hung down and the whole place became the most
loveliest bower of green that you might ask to see
He had just put up the last of his green stuff when the lantern
flickered up and then quenched it was burnt out
Illustration BIG MICHAEL CONTRIVED TO LIGHT THE CANDLE
Dear dear thought Michael a pity it is to say theres no light to
see it by even if theres no one to look at it itself
He stood still a bit It always took Michael a good while even to think
Then he said to himself Wait a bit go aisy now will ye as if the
wife was there to be prodding him on And then he began slowly to
unbutton his coat and then another under that and another and so on
much like peeling skins off an onion till at last he came to something
that he drew out very carefully something long and slim and that
gleamed white in the light of a match he struck against the wall
Theres a Christmas Candle for ye he said looking admiringly at
it two foot long if its an inch Mrs Melia does the thing right if
she goes to do it at all the decent nice poor woman that she is Gave
me that Candle in a Christmas present her Christmas box she said it
was and says she Itll do to welcome Art and the young wife home
says she And so of course it would if only it was a thing that they
were coming But sure God knows what happened to stop them But I
thought it as good say nothing about the Candle foreninst Herself to
be making her worse when I seen the way she was about the Crib itself
Its a pity she not to see it
Slowly and awkwardly Big Michael contrived to light the Candle and to
set it up in a bucket that was there handy He steadied it there by
melting some of the grease around it and made it firm so that it could
not upset to do damage to the stable Then when it was burning well he
went off turning when he got out into the storm and darkness outside to
look again at the Candle that was shedding a ray of lovely light far
into the night
Ay indeed thought he to himself with great satisfaction it is a
grand fine Christmas Candle sure enough And it would be noways right
for us even if we are only with ourselves tonight not to have one
lit the same as every other house in Ardenoo has the way if any poor
woman with a child in her arms was wandering by far from her own place
shed see the light and know there was room and a welcome waiting there
for them both Ay indeed a great Candle that is and will last well
and shine across the whole bog But I wish Mrs Melia had given me the
letter as well
CHAPTER III
THE LETTER
The queer thing is that Big Michael slow and all as he was happened to
be right about the letter from Art It had been written and moreover
it had reached Ardenoo postoffice But no one knew that for certain or
what became of it only a small little pup of a terrier dog belonging to
one of the Melia boys This pup was just of an age that it was a great
comfort to his mouth to have something he could chew He was lying
taking his ease just under the counter where the letters got sorted
And when as luck would have it Arts letter slipped down of all
others from the big heap of papers and all sorts that came very plenty
at that Christmas season this little dog had no delay only begin on
the letter In two minutes he had little dan made of itnothing left
of it only a couple or three little wet rags that got swep out the next
morning and never were heard of again Sure why would they when only
the pup knew anything about them And he couldnt explain the thing
even if he had wanted to He escaped a few kicks by that Still dogs
often get into trouble the same way God help them without having
earned it at all
Yes the invitation for the Christmas was answered The wife Delia her
name was had said nothing at first when it came To tell the truth she
was well satisfied where she was with Art and the child all to herself
in their one room in a back street Up a lot of stairs it was too and
the other people in the house not to say too tasty in their way of going
on But poor Delia thought it was all grand with the little bits of
furniture herself and Art would buy according as they could manage it
and the cradle in the corner by the fire
Poor Art would smother there betimes nighhand when hed think of the
Crooked Boreen and the wide silence of the bog with the soft sweet
wind blowing across it and the cows and all and the neighbours to pass
the time of day with let alone the smell of the turffire of an
evening Homesick the poor boy was and didnt know it
The way it came about that Art left home was he got tired of things
there the very things he wanted now And there was some said the
mother was too good and fond with him Shed lay the two hands under his
feet any hour of the day or night thought the sun shone out of him so
she did And Art was always good and biddable with her never gave any
backtalk or was contrary But all the time he wanted to be himself He
was much like a colt kept in a stall well fed and minded but he wants
to get out to stretch his legs in a long gallop all the time
So theres why Art went off from Ardenoo to the Big Smoke and got on
the best ever you knew He was very apprehensive about machinery could
understand it well and got took on by a great highup doctor to mind
his motor for him The old people were that proud when they heard of it
Sure its on the Pigs Back Art is now whatever they said with his
goodlookin pound a week
Wealth that sounded away off in Ardenoo But the sorra much spending
there is in it in a city where youre paying out for everything you
want Delia did the best she could with it but it wouldnt do all she
wanted
Still she pleased Art Small and white in the face she was as Mrs
Moloney had imagined her Sewing she used to be a bad life for a girl
to be at it all day But she flourished up well after getting married
And what Art had looked into when he was courting was the big
longinglooking dark eyes of her and the gentle voice and ways and the
clouds of soft brown hair  well sure every eye forms a beauty of its
own But Art might have done worse nor to marry Delia Fogarty that never
asked to differ from a word he said till the notion came up of they
going to Ardenoo for the Christmas When the letter asking them came he
near riz the roof off the house the shout he gave he was that
delighted in himself to be going back home
But whats a trouble to you Delia he says when he had time to take
notice that she wasnt looking as rejoiced as he expected only sitting
there with her eyes upon the child in her arms a bodyd think you
didnt care about going at all he says half vexed
I  Id like to go Art says Delia only I dont know do I want to
go or not I  do you see
Well  what
Sure  maybe  how do I know will they like me or not And me coat
all wore  and  and moreover I never got to get a right sort of a
hood for the child  or a cloak
Och what at all girl dear says Art that was so excited at the
thoughts of getting home that nothing was a trouble to him not like
you What else would they do And the child  well now isnt it well
we told them nothing about him the way hell be a surprise to them now
The fine big fellah that he is Sure it would be a sin to go put any
clothes on him at all hiding the brave big legs of him
Delia had to laugh at that and then Art went out and bought a grand
sheet of notepaper with robins and red berries and The Seasons
Compliments at the top of it And Delia wrote the letter upon this
because she could write real neat and nice Art told her every word to
say
DEAR FATHER AND MOTHER it began I have pleasure in taking up
my pen to rite yous those few lines hopping they find yous in good
health as they leave us at this present thank you and God I would
wish my love and best wishes to  and there were so many to be
remembered that Art told Delia to put in all inquiring friends
and even shortened like that the list hardly left room for saying
and we will go home for the Christmas and is obliged for the
kindness of asking and we will go by the last train Christmas Eve
and let yous meet that with Linggerin Death and the cart and
were bringing a Christmas box wid us that yous will be rejoiced to
see so I will end those few lines from your
SON AND NEW DAUGHTER
When that letter was finished and posted Delia made no more of an
objection to going only did the best she could washing and mending her
own little things and the babys But let her do her best and they were
poorlooking little bits of duds And manys the time when Art was
away that shed cry and wish to herself that there was no such a place
as Ardenoo on the face of this earthly world But what could she do
only please Art
Well the very evening before they were to start for Ardenoo didnt Art
come home to her in great humour Look at here Delia says he with a
big laugh see the fine handful of money and he held it out to her
that Himself is after giving me in a Christmas box Now well do the
thing in real style Come along out now before the shops shut and
well buy all before us
Well if you were to see the two of them that night the three indeed
for Delia wouldnt ever leave the child only took him with her To see
them looking in at the grand bright windows full of things and going
in Delia half afraid but Art as loud and outspoken as a lord spending
free as long as it lasted To see him then going home with her and the
child and he all loaded down with parcels and opened them all out the
minute they got back All the things they bought out of that money A
pipe and tobacco for Michael a lovely cake with Merry Christmas in
pink sugar upon it for Herself the grandest of brown shoes and a hat
and feather for Delia and as for the baby Delia could scarce
believe her eyes all they had got for him things she had been
wanting
Art made her fit them all on and when she held up the child to be
admired with the loveliest of a soft white shawl rolled round him He
becomes it well says Art and I suppose you think to make him look
better nor he is by all that finery
Your motherll think him terrible small said Delia looking very
fretted again but she kissed the baby as much as to say Little I
care what she thinks
She said nothing about that part of it though only looked up at Art
with the beseeching eyes I mentioned before
Let that go round says Art and he lifted the two of them in his arms
and kissed them both and then when he had let Delia go says he Me
mother is the smallest little crathureen herself that ever you saw So
she neednt talk And sure what can you expect from a child not a month
old yet And theres an ould saying and a true one in Ardenoo Its
not always the big people that reaps the harvest and so by this boy of
ours We wont feel till hell be working
Working said Delia And she unclasped the babys fingers and kissed
the tiny hands inside that were as soft and pink as roseleaves first
one hand and then the other She never thought that every hand no
matter how rough and strong begins by being a babys hand like the one
she was after kissing
Ay work says Art very determined it would amaze you or any one
that didnt know the way the children grow up and get sense at Ardenoo
the way if the old people seemed wishful for us to stop at home with
them this little fellah of ours would soon  but whisht before poor
Delia had time to say a word one way or other about this iday whisht
whats this at all A telegram for me
Illustration HE KISSED THEM BOTH
A telegram Poor Delia turned gashly pale at the word and hugged the
child closer to her as if she thought that little bit of an
orangecoloured envelope might be going to do some destruction on her
treasure
Art read it slowly to himself while his face grew as long as today and
tomorrow and says he Well it cant be helped The Master thats
after getting a hurried call to the country and will want me to drive
him  so Ill not be at readness to go He looked anxiously at
Delia
Not go to Ardenoo Delias heart leaped up
Sure cant we stop where we are says she with dancing eyes
Och not at all says Art it wouldnt answer at all to be
disappointing them And besides its down that side he wants to go
some sick child  the Master I mean  Ill likely be at Ardenoo
before you
But Art  is it go wid meself What will I do at all at all and
Delia begins to cry
See here now says Art dont be taking on that way You wouldnt
have me disappoint the Master  after he being so good to us too The
fine grand little clothes were after getting Youll be as right as
rain Just wait till youre at Ardenoo where every one knows me Why
youll be with friends that very minute And you wrote it in the letter
yourself what train to meet you at You wouldnt be fretting me
mother and she thinking to have us for the Christmas  to make no
mention of the child at all
To be sure not says Delia And she dried her eyes and said no more
only got ready and went off the next day with the little child as
smiling and gay as she could appear waving her hand to Art that saw her
off at the Broadstone station and did all he could to put her in heart
But its a long long ways from the Big Smoke to Ardenoo Hours and
hours it took that wet wild day to get there And Delia wasnt too well
accustomed to trains and going about She managed to keep the child warm
and comforted all through but when the train stopped at Ardenoo she was
that tired and giddy herself that she scarcely knew what she was doing
or where she was to go
She stood a minute on the platform with the wind and rain beating down
upon her till it had her even more confused And the day was nearly
done and no lamps lit yet But she made out a porter and asked him as
Art had bid her for Mr Moloneys asscart
Moloneys ass and dray Ay says the man Big Michael was in the Town
today at Melias and buying all before him by what I hear And not
too long ago it was
Would I  could I find him  wheres that place youre after
mentioning
And Delia took a grip of the big hat that the wind was getting at
Melias shop You cant miss it Theres neer another He should
have left it by now  but let you go on along that road  and he
showed her where it lay stretching off into the darkness and youll
overtake him ready That ass is middling slow
The man guessed who this was speaking to him for they all had heard
about Art and the wife being expected for the Christmas And he had no
call to tell her to go off like that Big Michael was nighhand at home
again by then But he had a sup taken at that present as often happens
at Christmas Only he was a bit on hed never have put such an iday
into Delias head To think of letting her start after Michael like
that
But poor Delia knew no better than to follow fools advice how could
she So she just asked some directions about the road and then she
changed the child from one arm to the other and faced out in the night
and rain and a wind that would blow the horns off a goose to overtake
the asscart Little she thought that it was back at the Crooked Boreen
by then near five good miles away
For a while she wasnt in too bad a heart at all She was glad to be
out of the train and she was expecting every step to get some signs of
Michael on in front But the little light there was went altogether
before long quenched like by the great rain and the heavy clouds that
hung low and dark in the skies Delia began to feel it very lonesome
But she kept going on what else could she do
At this time what she thought worst of was that the wet was spoiling
her good hat after Art spending his money upon it the way she could
make some kind of appearance foreninst his mother and the neighbours
But what could she do to save it
The cut Ill be she thought all dreeped with rain And indeed the
hat with its grand feather all broken and draggled was a poorlooking
thing enough before she was halfways to the Crooked Boreen As for the
grand shoes with the high heels they were like sponges upon her feet
and she slipping in them as she stumbled along through mud and gutter to
her ankles
But she kept going on The baby lay warm and snug upon her heart She
managed to keep him sheltered anyway Now and then shed stop and put
her face down to his to feel his sweet warm breath upon her cheek Then
shed go on again That asscart If only she could catch it Wouldnt
it be Heaven to be taken off her aching feet and be carried along
herself and the child with some one that knew the way and not to be
feeling lost as she did now
For by degrees thats what Delia had to think she was lost Still she
struggled on the poor little betdown thing that she was so tired that
she only kept moving at all by clenching her teeth hard and saying out
loud I must I must A nice thing it would be for Art to not find me
when he gets home I must keep going on The baby would die if I was to
lie down for that is what she was more inclined for than anything
else
The wind was coming in great gusts now hindering her far worse than the
rain It caught her skirts like the sails of a ship it snatched at her
hat She tried to hold it on but a sudden strong blast came just as
she was shifting the child again in her arms Like a spiteful hand it
tore the hat from her head and furled it away and what could be done
to get it again in the storm and darkness Delia cried at first
thinking of the loss it was But she minded nothing long only the
tiredness and that still she must keep going on
Suddenly she began to sing to the child
I laid my love in a cradleybed
Lu lu lu lu la lay
Little white love with a soft round head
Lu lu lu lu la lay
Before she had it done she thought to see a light a piece off from her
She made towards it Out upon the bog itself she was now and them that
saw her tracks after said one of the holy Angels must have been guiding
her then that she wasnt drownded herself and the child in a
boghole She slipped here and she fell there on the wet rough ground
but she kept on till she reached the light It was the Christmas Candle
in Michaels stable burning there mild and watchful
CHAPTER IV
THE CRIB
While all this was going on Big Michael was sitting snug and
comfortable in the chimneycorner opposite the wife and she knitting
knitting away still Not a word was passing She had Michaels supper
ready for him hot and tasty the same as ever But he had no goo for
it What did he care was it good or bad How could he feel gay and riz
up in himself the way a body should at the Christmas when he knew well
