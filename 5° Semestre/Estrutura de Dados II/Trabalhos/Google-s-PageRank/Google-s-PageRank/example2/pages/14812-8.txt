CHAPTER I
IN PERSPECTIVE
In fortunes empire blindly thus we go
We wander after pathless destiny
Whose dark resorts since prudence cannot know
In vain it would provide for what shall be
A trip to the Pyrenees is not in the Grand Tour It is not even in any
southerly extension of the Grand Tour A proposition to exploit them
meets a dubious reception Pictures arise of desolate gorges of lonely
roads and dangerous trails of dismal roadside inns where when you
halt for the night a repulsivelooking landlord receives the unhappy
man exchanges a look of ferocious intelligence with the driverand
the usual melodramatic midnight carnage probably ensues The Pyrenees
seem to echo the motto of their old counts Touchesy si tu loses
the name seems to stand vaguely for untested discomforts for clouds and
chasms and Spanish banditti in bloodred capas to be in a word a
symbol of an undiscovered country which would but doubtfully reward a
resolve to discover
Yet there is a fascination in the project as we discuss a summer tour
There we know are mountains whose sides are nearly Alpine whose
shoulders are of snow and glacier whose heads rise to ten and eleven
thousand feet above the sea There we know must be savage
sceneryravines cliffs icerivers as in the Alps valleys and
streams and fair pastures as well and a richer southern sunlight over
the uplands besides a people less warped by tourists intensely
tenacious of the past and still tingling with their old local love of
countrya people with whom to be a Bearnais is greater than to be a
Frenchman
To visit the Pyrenees too will be almost to live again in the Middle
Ages The Roman the Moor the Paladin Froissart Henry of Navarre
have marked the region both in romance and in soberer fact Its valleys
have individual histories its aged towns and castles stirring
biographies The provinces on its northern flanks once a centre a
nucleus of old French chivalry are saturated with medival adventure
One visits the Alps to be in the tide of travel to find health in the
air to feel the religion of noble mountains In the Pyrenees is all
this and morethe present and the past as well As we call down the
shades of old chroniclers from the dust of upper library tiers we grow
more and more in desire of a closer acquaintance Csar Charlemagne
Roland the Black Prince Gaston Phoebus Montgomery and knightly King
Henry stand in ghostly armor and beckon us on
II
Facts of detail prove farther to seek We inquire almost in vain for
travelers notes on the Pyrenees Those who had written on Spanish
travel spoke of the range admiringly But these authors we find
invariably only passed by the eastern extremity or the western of the
great mountain wall the mountains themselves they did not visit Search
in the large libraries brings out a few scant volumes of Pyrenean
travel but all with two or three exceptions bear date within the
first threefifths of the century It is with books often as with the
Furancon the wine of the Pyrenees and with certain other vintages
age improves them only up to a certain limit when put away longer than
a generation they lose value
Taines glowing Tour1 itself made nearly thirty years ago is a
delight almost a marvel the style the torrent of simile the vivid
thought rank it as a classic But M Taines is less a book of travel
than a work of art in the iridescence of the descriptions you lose the
reflection of the things described Even handbooks the wayclearing
lictors of travel prove as to the Pyrenees region first scarce and
then scanty The few we unearth in the stores are armed only with the
usual perfunctory fasces of factscording information into stiff
labeled bunches marshaling details into cramped and characterless
order scrutinizing the ground with a microscope never surveying it in
birdseye view Two recent novels we eagerly buy hearing that their
scenes are laid in that vicinity but each merely speaks in easy
omniscience of the distant chain of blue mountains or of the
faroff snowpeaks outlined against the horizon and the fiction
proves hardly worth sifting for so little fact Plainly the Pyrenees
lack the voluminous literature of the Alps Plainly we shall have in
part to grope our way The grooves of AngloSaxon travel are many and
deep lined increasingly with English speech and customs but they have
not yet been cut into these Spanish mountains
1 Voyage aux Pyrenees
The search enlarges the horizon however The lonely roads we learn to
qualify in thought with occasional branches of railway the dangerous
trails with certain cultivated highways the dismal roadside inns
with spasmodic hotels some even named confidently as palatial We
read of spas and springs and French society more than of chasms and
banditti We realize in surprise that over all the past of these
mountains flows now in bracing contrast the easy laughing tide of
modern French fashionlife so different in detail so like in kind to
the day of trapping and tourney
It is enough
Now are we fixd and now we will depart
Never to come again till what we seek
Be found
III
Difficulties always lessen after a decision I casually question a
doughty Colonel who has been an indefatigable traveler he has twice
girdled the earth and has many times crosshatched Spain he has not
been to the Pyrenees but heartily urges the trip He assures me that
the banditti there have become he believes comparatively few that
they now rarely slit their captives ears and that present quotations
for ransoms so he hears are ruling very low much lower than at any
previous epoch Thus comforted we interview other traveled friends but
our goal is to all an unvisited district We find no kindly Old
Travelers returned from Pyrenees soil to counsel us advise us and
inflict wellmeant and inordinate itineraries upon us At least then
we are not alone in our ignorance it is evident that our knowledge of
the region is not blamably less than that of others and that the
Pyrenees are in literal fact a land untrodden by Americans
Questions of accessibility now arise It seems a far cry from Paris to
the doors of Spain The Pyrenees are not on the way to Italy as are the
Alps They are not on the way around the world as are the Mountains of
Lebanon and the Sierras They are not strictly on the way even to Spain
But we consider Our country men are streaming to Europe quickeyed for
unhackneyed routes throwing over the continent new and endless
networks of silver trails They travel three full days to reach the
Norway fjords and five in addition to see the high noon of midnight
They journey a day and night to Berlin and fortytwo hours
consecutively after without wayside interest to visit the City of the
Great Czar if they persevere toward the Kremlin and around by
Warsaws waste of ruin they will have counted a week in a railway
compartment Constantinople and Athens lie two thousand miles away
Naples and Granada nearly as far all sought even in summer though
quivering in the tropics livid heat We came round to our Pyrenees it
needs from Paris but nine hours to Bordeaux with coigns of vantage
between in four hours from Bordeaux you are by the waters of the Bay
of Biscay or in six in the centre of the Pyrenees chain
IV
And so La Champagne leaves its long wake across the Atlantic and we
journey down from Paris to the little city of the Maid of Orleans
wander to Tours the approximate scene of the great Saracenic defeat
drive along the quays of Bordeaux and visit its vineyards and finally
come on in the luxurious cars of the Midi line to the shores of
Cantabria and the popular wateringplace of Biarritz
CHAPTER II
A BISCAYAN BEACH
Clearly we are in advance of the summer season at Biarritz It is the
latter part of June The air is soft and warm the billows lap the shore
enticingly But fashion has not yet transferred its court the van of
the column only has arrived A few adventurous bathers test the cool
surf the tabledhote is slimly attended the liverymen confidentially
assure us as an inducement for drives that their prices are now
crouching low for a prodigious leap to follow
But everything has a pleasing air of anticipation Since we are to be
out of the season at all we are glad we are in advance of it This is
the youth of the summer not its old age People are looking forward
events are approaching instead of receding the coming months seem big
with indefinite promise of benefit and pleasure
We quickly become imbued with the general hopefulness of the place
Every one has the look of one making ready You hear all day long when
far enough from the waves a vague joyous hum of bustle pervading the
town The enterprising click of hammer or trowel falls constantly on the
ear The masons are at work upon the new villas and our hotel is
completing a fine addition for a cafe the stores along the busy little
main street are being put in order the windows alluringly stocked and
bright awnings unrolled above them fenders from the summers heat The
hotels are fairly awake Everything is rejoicing that the
semihibernation is over
Illustration RELIEF MAP OF THE CENTRAL PYRENEES
Biarritz the town is as delightful if not as picturesque as we had
hoped Perhaps it is too modern to be picturesque In this part of the
world at least one rather requires the picturesque to be allied with
the old The nucleus of Biarritz is old but that is out of sight in the
modern overgrowth Biarritz as it is is of this half century
This is not on the whole to be regretted Biarritz has no history no
past of associations no landmarks to be guarded Vandalism in the form
of the modern rebuilder can here work more good than harm Save for its
location at the edge of the wild Basque country and what it has seen
itself sheltered by obscurity of the forays of that restless people
the place has little to tell It is a wateringplace pure and simple
buoyed entirely by the prospering ebb and flow of modern fashion Let us
take it as of today not of yesterday content to seek its charms under
that aspect alone enjoying it for itself not for its pedigree
Biarritz is a prerogative instance of the magnetism of royaltyof the
social power of the court as an institution It was a wateringplace in
a small way before Eugenies advent but there was not a tithe of its
present size and popularity In 1840 it numbered in all not more than
fifty houses a few of them lodgings or humble cafes but the greater
part staid little whitewashed summerdwellings with green verandas and
occasional roofbalconies set down irregularly without street or
system along the sunny slopes of the bluff Murrays Handbook for
1848 gives it passing notice and disrespectfully styles it the dullest
place upon earth for one having no resources of friends upon the spot
But in the modern edition of forty years later the same manual has come
to describe the place in a very different strain assigns it a
population of nearly 6000 details with respect its fashionable rank
its villas and increasing hotels its graded streets and driveways and
among other things adds the simple remark that about twentyone
thousand strangers now visit Biarritz every year Evidently there has
been some advance within the span
It was the Empress of the French who distilled the lifeelixir for the
quiet little resort As a maiden she had spent long summers by its
shore and when she was become the first lady in the land she turned
still to Biarritz and the midsummer tide of fashion followed after her
Across the downs on the bluff stands the Villa Eugenie the handsel
of Biarritzs prosperity and here about us is the town that grew up to
make her court
Fair France lost as well as gained when the burning walls of the
Tuileries crashed in In these days of the plain French Republicof
its sober unornamental business governmentthe contrast is vivid
with the glitter and go of Louis Napoleons regime And the nation
feels it and involuntarily grieves over it The twenty years have far
from sufficed to smother that certain inborn Gallic joy in
monarchyautocratic rule a brilliant court leadership in fashion
and all the pomp and pageantry which the French love so well
Little more than a century ago stable governments seemed at last to be
ruling the world civilization had come to believe itself finally at
peace war it was complacently said had finished its work the coming
cycles would prove so far tamed as to have outgrown fightings and
revolutions Cultured modern history like Nature would refuse to
proceed per saltum Yet the hundred years since gone by have brought
wars as fierce leaps of government as tremendous as any century in
the past It is this same fair France that has contributed more than her
share of them and the Fall of the Second Empire was one of the most
dramatic The world is not after all so securely merged from the
darkness of the Dark Ages Within that short century in Paris itself
the very capital of cultured Europe there has twice uprisen a human
savagery immeasurably exceeding all the tales we are to tell of the
fierce past of the Pyrenees
It needs an effort today to picture the social power of France and
Eugenie twenty years ago The mantle has not fallen to England and
Alexandra Only a people like the French can endue fashion with
absolutism
So it was that when the Empress came to Biarritz all the world came
also From the building of her villa dates the true origin of Biarritz
From that time its growth was progressive and sound When the empire
finally fell this creature of its making had already passed the
dangerpoint and so stood unshaken Biarritz had become too popular
its clientele too devoted to part company Even in the winter it has
its increasing colony in summer its vogue is beyond caprice The
sparkle of the royal occupation has gone and the royal villa is
tenantless but the place no longer needs a helping hand for it is
abundantly able to walk alone
Illustration BEACH AND VILLA EUGENIE AT BIARRITZ
II
In the afternoon we wander down to the sands The tide is low The long
billows of the Bay of Biscay roll smugly in hypocritical and placid
with nothing to betray the unenviable reputation they sustain in mediis
aquis The broad smooth beach is not notably different in kind from
other beaches but we instantly see the peculiar charm of its location
The shore sweeps off in a long lazy crescent rounding up a mile or
two to the northward with the lighthouse near Bayonne Southward we
cannot follow it from where we stand for the near irregularities of
cliff cut it off from sight Back from the beach rises the bluff
curving northward with the crescent at our left it comes boldly down
toward the water partitioning the beach and breaking up at the edge
into strange gaunt capes and peninsulas Black masses of rock large
and small are crouching out among the waves tortured by storms into
misshapen forms and anguished attitudes patted and petted into
fantastic humps and contortions The strata dip at an angle of about
twentyfive degrees and the stone is friable and defenceless
Soothingly now the water is running over and around these rocks or
whitens their outlines with foam granting their piteous torsos in
merciful caprice a days brief respite from the agony of its
scourgings
The afternoon sun shines brightly against the bathing pavilion
irradiating its red and yellow brick Along the narrow sheltered
platform at its front sit matronly French dowagers holding their
daughters as it were in leash and talking of women and things and
affairs of state Though early in the season the beach is well
sprinkled with people A few attempt the bathing again but the rest
saunter here and there or enjoy beachchairs at a stipulated rental The
elderly French gentleman a dapper and interesting specimen rarely
paralleled at home strolls about contentedly on the asphalt promenade
back from the beach smoking a cigar and fingering a light bamboo
Younger men also welldressed pass in couples or walk with a mother
and daughternever with the daughter alone Boatmen and candypeddlers
ramble in and out a Basque fisherman or two linger about the scene and
dogs a pony and a captive monkey add an element of animal life
Despite its sunny holiday temperament Biarritz was one of certain
Biscayan villages once denounced as given up to the worship of the
devilthus denounced by Henry IVs bloodthirsty inquisitor Pierre de
Lancre a veritable French Jeffreys and the same who in 1609 put to
death no less than eight hundred persons on the ground of sorcery He
tells us that the devils and malignant spirits banished from Japan and
the Indies took refuge here in the mountains of Labourd Above all he
asserts that the young girls of Biarritz always celebrated for their
beauty have in their left eye a mark impressed by the devil
Happily we have no devil in this nineteenth century and in the clear
glance of these Biarritz peasants loitering on the sands we find that
his brandmarks have disappeared with him
A few of the faces we meet are English many are Spanish and show that
Biarritz draws its worshipers from the South as from the North Indeed
a large proportion of its summer society wears the mantilla and wields
the fan Other marks too of Spanish dress are here as where little
girls in manyhued outfit romp along the sands dragooned by darkfaced
nurses in true Iberian costume Three or four brilliant red parasols add
amazingly to the general effect of the scene
We repair to the stone parapet before the pavilion and gravely paying
our dues for chairs sit and watch the picture There is no charge for
sitting on the beach but this is severely frowned upon at Biarritz The
dues are two sous per chair and with true Continental thrift they are
always rigorously collected Whether one wanders into the open square of
the Palais Royal at Paris or listens to the music in the Place de
Tourny at Bordeaux or watches the waves at Biarritz the old woman with
her little black bag at once appears upon the scene Some Frenchless
friends in Paris on one occasion guilelessly seated in the gardens of
the Palais Royal took the collector simply for a pertinacious
beggarwoman and waved her airily off She returned to the charge of
course in indignant French and grew angrier every moment as she found
herself still loftily ignored A warm fracas was in prospect when a
passing American fortunately cleared up the complication the woman
would have called in a gendarme unhesitatingly to enforce her
diminutive claim
On the bluff beyond the pavilion Eugenies villa a square rich
building of English brick surveys the scene its existence has brought
about Around us on the beach the nurses sit in the shade of the rocks
and discourse on the respective failings of their charges Children dig
in the sand with pail and shovel with the same zest as at home
Childnature changes little with locality So recently from the great
unknown it is not yet seamed and crusted by environment I suppose that
children fairly represent the prehistoric man Impulse appetite
passionall the gusts of the moment sway them We quell our emotions
so uniformly as we grow on that we finally hardly feel their
struggles The children have richer life than we in some respects
Faith and wonder and the primal earth
Are born into the world with every child
I make no doubt that Nimrod or Achilles and Ajax great children that
they were as ready to cry as to feast to laugh as to fight hunting
mightily sulking in the tent or defying the lightningintense
sudden human all throughdrank down their strong muddy potion of
existence with a smack far heartier than the reflective sips of life
which civilization has now taught us to take Childhood is wide and free
and abounding and near to nature and we can take thoughts from it and
ponder perhaps dubiously on the distance we since have traveled
The children dig in the sand and throw it over the nurses just as they
are doing at Old Orchard and Old Point Here with a maid is a pair of
children who freely show one attribute of childhood not so pleasing as
otherscruelty They have a little monkey fastened by collar and
chain and it is pitiful and yet ludicrous to see the close watch the
animal keeps on his captors movements He has found a slack chain his
best policy and adapts his every motion anxiously and solicitously to
the leaps of the boy But the utmost vigilance avails him little When
the child is weary with running and sudden turns which have called for
marvelous dexterity of accommodation on the part of the monkey the
chain is hauled up with the animal clinging worriedly to it and he is
flung far out into the fringe of waves to pick his shivering way up
again and again from the water These children have a white rat also
which they chase over the sand and souse into puddles and otherwise
maltreat It is useless to interfere parentally and we hardly see our
way to buying either rat or monkey even to ensure them a peaceable old
age One wonders why children have this queer taint of cruelty
Unconscious cruelty it may be but it seems none the less out of place
in their fresh unused nature We outgrow some rude vices as well as
rude virtues in becoming older and there is comfort in that
III
The bluff coming out to the sea cuts off close at hand the curve of
the shore toward the south and we climb by a sloping path From the
top we look down upon the beach we have left back upon the downs
cluster the numberless private villas which form a feature of Biarritz
to the left over the near roofs and hotels of the town we can see the
first faroff pickets of the Pyrenees while immediately in front now
appear below us three or four rocky bays and coves broken by the lines
of the cliff and partly sheltered by the rocks out at sea Many of
these rocks writes an oldtime visitor2 in the pleasantly aging
English of 1840 are perforated with holes so that with a high sea
and an incoming tide and always indeed in some degree when the tide
flows the water pours through these hollows and rents presenting the
singular appearance of many cascades Some of the rocks lying close to
the shore and many of those which form the cliff are worn into vast
caverns In these the waves make ceaseless musica hollow dismal
sound like distant thunderand when a broad swelling wave bounds
into these caverns and breaks in some distant chamber the shock to
one standing on the beach is like a slight earthquake But when a storm
rises in the Bay of Biscay and a northwest wind sweeps across the
Atlantic the scene is grand beyond the power of description The whole
space covered with rocks which are scattered over the coast is an
expanse of foam boiling whirlpools and cataracts and the noise of the
tremendous waves rushing into these vast caverns and lashing their
inner walls is grander a thousand times than the most terrific
thunderstorm that ever burst from the sky
2 INGLIS Switzerland and the South of France
In these little coves now float idle pleasureboats bright with paint
and listless awnings and ready to be manned by their stout Basque
rowers Here too are the fishermens cabins snugly built in against
the rocks and garnished with baskets and poles and with men repairing
their nets The irregular curves of the bluff broken here into abrupt
and dislocated masses lend themselves readily to winding paths and we
ramble on curving upward and downward over short bridges and through
little tunnels under the rocks each turn giving a new view of the bay
or the town
Finally we round another promontory cross a last bridge to a large
rockislet standing out from the mainland and lo the crescent of the
coast is completed and far to the south we see a low mountain ending
the curve it is Spain
IV
In the dreamy summer stillness we sit with content looking at those
distant hills listening to the lapping of the waves watching the sun
sink lower toward the sea The afternoon sunlight makes a glade across
the watersseeming to one from a western seaboard like some
strange disarrangement in the day
Illustration HERE TOO ARE THE FISHERMENS CABINS
The rounded mountains before us are indeed in Spain a communicative
fisherman tells us At the foot of the outermost eighteen miles away
is hidden the old Spanish town of Fuenterrabia On its other side in a
hollow of the coast lies San Sebastian Nearer us though well down
along the sweep of the grey clay bluffs is St Jean de Luz which with
the others lies on our intended way
We seem to see conforming to the crescent of that foreign coast the
menacing crescent of the Armada parting from Spanish shores just three
hundred years ago to a month to crush AngloSaxon civilization There
before us lies the land of intolerance and bigotry which gave it being
the land of Philip the Second and his Inquisition But for Drake and
Howard and Englands wooden walls events would have moved differently
during the last three centuriesin our country as in theirs
V
The last spark of the sun has disappeared in the water We turn into the
town in the fading light passing another large bathing pavilion in a
sheltered cove and saunter homeward through an undulating street the
aorta of Biarritz It is not a wide street but it is busy and brisk
and it has a refurbished look like newly scoured metal Neat
dwellinghouses guarded behind stone walls and wellkept hedges
display frequent signs of furnished apartments to let Small and large
shops alternate sociably in the line there is the epicerie or
grocerystore with raisins and olives and Albert biscuits in the
window next is a lace and worsted shop where black Spanish nettings
vie with gay crotchetwork
By Heaven it is a splendid sight to see
Their rival scarfs of mixd embroidery
all made by hand and bewilderingly lowpriced Now we come to a
mirrored cafe the Frenchmans hearthside it compels a detour into the
middle of the street since the sidewalk is quite preempted by its
chairs and tiny tables Here is another Spanish store conspicuous for
its painted tambourines with pendent webs of red and yellow worsted and
for its spreading fans colordashed with exciting pictures of
bullfights and spangled matadors A hotel appears next across the way
standing back from the street with a small triangular park between
and then comes a pretentious bricabrac bazaar and another cafe and a
confectioners and a tobaccostoreeach presided over by a buxom
French matron affable and vigilant and clearly the animating spirit of
the establishment
Tiny carriages of a peculiar species with donkeys and boy drivers line
the streets The carriage holds onesay an infirm dowager seeking the
afternoon breezeand if the drivers attendance is desired he is able
to run beside it for miles It is light and noiseless comfortably
cushioned always within call and governed by a beneficently trifling
tariff These vinaigrettes as they are called would be appreciated
at home if habit took kindly to novelties How greatly they might
simplify problems of calling and shopping Our conveyances are all
cumbrous We must have the huge barouche the coach the closeshut
coupe Even the phaeton yields to the high Tcart But convention is
autocratic and would frown on these vinaigrettes as it frowns on many
useful ideas Another unfortunate victim of its taboo is the
sedanchair which would be lustily stared at today yet the utility of
which might be made positively inestimable One who reads of the Chinese
palanquins or sees the carryingchairs of Switzerland convenient and
