business with the parson is in the middle turned to his end Within
reach of his hand is a stationery case and a cabinet photograph in a
frame Behind him the right hand wall recessed above the fireplace is
fitted with bookshelves on which an adept eye can measure the parsons
divinity and casuistry by a complete set of Brownings poems and
Maurices Theological Essays and guess at his politics from a yellow
backed Progress and Poverty Fabian Essays a Dream of John Ball
Marxs Capital and half a dozen other literary landmarks in Socialism
Opposite him on the left near the typewriter is the door Further
down the room opposite the fireplace a bookcase stands on a cellaret
with a sofa near it There is a generous fire burning and the hearth
with a comfortable armchair and a japanned flower painted coal scuttle
at one side a miniature chair for a boy or girl on the other a nicely
varnished wooden mantelpiece with neatly moulded shelves tiny bits of
mirror let into the panels and a travelling clock in a leather case
the inevitable wedding present and on the wall above a large
autotype of the chief figure in Titians Virgin of the Assumption is
very inviting Altogether the room is the room of a good housekeeper
vanquished as far as the table is concerned by an untidy man but
elsewhere mistress of the situation The furniture in its ornamental
aspect betrays the style of the advertised drawingroom suite of the
pushing suburban furniture dealer but there is nothing useless or
pretentious in the room The paper and panelling are dark throwing the
big cheery window and the park outside into strong relief
The Reverend James Mavor Morell is a Christian Socialist clergyman of
the Church of England and an active member of the Guild of St Matthew
and the Christian Social Union A vigorous genial popular man of
forty robust and goodlooking full of energy with pleasant hearty
considerate manners and a sound unaffected voice which he uses with
the clean athletic articulation of a practised orator and with a wide
range and perfect command of expression He is a first rate clergyman
able to say what he likes to whom he likes to lecture people without
setting himself up against them to impose his authority on them
without humiliating them and to interfere in their business without
impertinence His wellspring of spiritual enthusiasm and sympathetic
emotion has never run dry for a moment he still eats and sleeps
heartily enough to win the daily battle between exhaustion and
recuperation triumphantly Withal a great baby pardonably vain of his
powers and unconsciously pleased with himself He has a healthy
complexion a good forehead with the brows somewhat blunt and the
eyes bright and eager a mouth resolute but not particularly well cut
and a substantial nose with the mobile spreading nostrils of the
dramatic orator but like all his features void of subtlety
The typist Miss Proserpine Garnett is a brisk little woman of about
30 of the lower middle class neatly but cheaply dressed in a black
merino skirt and a blouse rather pert and quick of speech and not
very civil in her manner but sensitive and affectionate She is
clattering away busily at her machine whilst Morell opens the last of
his mornings letters He realizes its contents with a comic groan of
despair
PROSERPINE Another lecture
MORELL Yes The Hoxton Freedom Group want me to address them on Sunday
morning great emphasis on Sunday this being the unreasonable part
of the business What are they
PROSERPINE Communist Anarchists I think
MORELL Just like Anarchists not to know that they cant have a parson
on Sunday Tell them to come to church if they want to hear me it will
do them good Say I can only come on Mondays and Thursdays Have you
the diary there
PROSERPINE taking up the diary Yes
MORELL Have I any lecture on for next Monday
PROSERPINE referring to diary Tower Hamlets Radical Club
MORELL Well Thursday then
PROSERPINE English Land Restoration League
MORELL What next
PROSERPINE Guild of St Matthew on Monday Independent Labor Party
Greenwich Branch on Thursday Monday SocialDemocratic Federation
Mile End Branch Thursday first Confirmation class Impatiently
Oh Id better tell them you cant come Theyre only half a dozen
ignorant and conceited costermongers without five shillings between
them
MORELL amused Ah but you see theyre near relatives of mine Miss
Garnett
PROSERPINE staring at him Relatives of YOURS
MORELL Yes we have the same fatherin Heaven
PROSERPINE relieved Oh is that all
MORELL with a sadness which is a luxury to a man whose voice expresses
it so finely Ah you dont believe it Everybody says it nobody
believes itnobody Briskly getting back to business Well well
Come Miss Proserpine cant you find a date for the costers What
about the 25th that was vacant the day before yesterday
PROSERPINE referring to diary Engagedthe Fabian Society
MORELL Bother the Fabian Society Is the 28th gone too
PROSERPINE City dinner Youre invited to dine with the Founders
Company
MORELL Thatll do Ill go to the Hoxton Group of Freedom instead
She enters the engagement in silence with implacable disparagement of
the Hoxton Anarchists in every line of her face Morell bursts open the
cover of a copy of The Church Reformer which has come by post and
glances through Mr Stewart Hendlams leader and the Guild of St
Matthew news These proceedings are presently enlivened by the
appearance of Morells curate the Reverend Alexander Mill a young
gentleman gathered by Morell from the nearest University settlement
whither he had come from Oxford to give the east end of London the
benefit of his university training He is a conceitedly well
intentioned enthusiastic immature person with nothing positively
unbearable about him except a habit of speaking with his lips carefully
closed for half an inch from each corner a finicking arthulation and
a set of horribly corrupt vowels notably ow for o this being his
chief means of bringing Oxford refinement to bear on Hackney vulgarity
Morell whom he has won over by a doglike devotion looks up
indulgently from The Church Reformer as he enters and remarks Well
Lexy Late again as usual
LEXY Im afraid so I wish I could get up in the morning
MORELL exulting in his own energy Ha ha Whimsically Watch and
pray Lexy watch and pray
LEXY I know Rising wittily to the occasion But how can I watch and
pray when I am asleep Isnt that so Miss Prossy
PROSERPINE sharply Miss Garnett if you please
LEXY I beg your pardonMiss Garnett
PROSERPINE Youve got to do all the work today
LEXY Why
PROSERPINE Never mind why It will do you good to earn your supper
before you eat it for once in a way as I do Come dont dawdle You
should have been off on your rounds half an hour ago
LEXY perplexed Is she in earnest Morell
MORELL in the highest spiritshis eyes dancing Yes I am going to
dawdle today
LEXY You You dont know how
MORELL heartily Ha ha Dont I Im going to have this day all to
myselfor at least the forenoon My wifes coming back shes due here
at 1145
LEXY surprised Coming back alreadywith the children I thought
they were to stay to the end of the month
MORELL So they are shes only coming up for two days to get some
flannel things for Jimmy and to see how were getting on without her
LEXY anxiously But my dear Morell if what Jimmy and Fluffy had was
scarlatina do you think it wise
MORELL Scarlatinarubbish German measles I brought it into the
house myself from the Pycroft Street School A parson is like a doctor
my boy he must face infection as a soldier must face bullets He
rises and claps Lexy on the shoulder Catch the measles if you can
Lexy shell nurse you and what a piece of luck that will be for
youeh
LEXY smiling uneasily Its so hard to understand you about Mrs
Morell
MORELL tenderly Ah my boy get marriedget married to a good
woman and then youll understand Thats a foretaste of what will be
best in the Kingdom of Heaven we are trying to establish on earth That
will cure you of dawdling An honest man feels that he must pay Heaven
for every hour of happiness with a good spell of hard unselfish work
to make others happy We have no more right to consume happiness
without producing it than to consume wealth without producing it Get a
wife like my Candida and youll always be in arrear with your
repayment He pats Lexy affectionately on the back and is leaving the
room when Lexy calls to him
LEXY Oh wait a bit I forgot Morell halts and turns with the door
knob in his hand Your fatherinlaw is coming round to see you
Morell shuts the door again with a complete change of manner
MORELL surprised and not pleased Mr Burgess
LEXY Yes I passed him in the park arguing with somebody He gave me
good day and asked me to let you know that he was coming
MORELL half incredulous But he hasnt called here forI may almost
say for years Are you sure Lexy Youre not joking are you
LEXY earnestly No sir really
MORELL thoughtfully Hm Time for him to take another look at Candida
before she grows out of his knowledge He resigns himself to the
inevitable and goes out Lexy looks after him with beaming foolish
worship
LEXY What a good man What a thorough loving soul he is He takes
Morells place at the table making himself very comfortable as he
takes out a cigaret
PROSERPINE impatiently pulling the letter she has been working at off
the typewriter and folding it Oh a man ought to be able to be fond
of his wife without making a fool of himself about her
LEXY shocked Oh Miss Prossy
PROSERPINE rising busily and coming to the stationery case to get an
envelope in which she encloses the letter as she speaks Candida
here and Candida there and Candida everywhere She licks the
envelope Its enough to drive anyone out of their SENSES thumping
the envelope to make it stick to hear a perfectly commonplace woman
raved about in that absurd manner merely because shes got good hair
and a tolerable figure
LEXY with reproachful gravity I think her extremely beautiful Miss
Garnett He takes the photograph up looks at it and adds with even
greater impressiveness EXTREMELY beautiful How fine her eyes are
PROSERPINE Her eyes are not a bit better than minenow He puts down
the photograph and stares austerely at her And you know very well
that you think me dowdy and second rate enough
LEXY rising majestically Heaven forbid that I should think of any of
Gods creatures in such a way He moves stiffly away from her across
the room to the neighbourhood of the bookcase
PROSERPINE Thank you Thats very nice and comforting
LEXY saddened by her depravity I had no idea you had any feeling
against Mrs Morell
PROSERPINE indignantly I have no feeling against her Shes very
nice very goodhearted Im very fond of her and can appreciate her
real qualities far better than any man can He shakes his head sadly
and turns to the bookcase looking along the shelves for a volume She
follows him with intense pepperiness You dont believe me He turns
and faces her She pounces at him with spitfire energy You think Im
jealous Oh what a profound knowledge of the human heart you have Mr
Lexy Mill How well you know the weaknesses of Woman dont you It
must be so nice to be a man and have a fine penetrating intellect
instead of mere emotions like us and to know that the reason we dont
share your amorous delusions is that were all jealous of one another
She abandons him with a toss of her shoulders and crosses to the fire
to warm her hands
LEXY Ah if you women only had the same clue to Mans strength that
you have to his weakness Miss Prossy there would be no Woman Question
PROSERPINE over her shoulder as she stoops holding her hands to the
blaze Where did you hear Morell say that You didnt invent it
yourself youre not clever enough
LEXY Thats quite true I am not ashamed of owing him that as I owe
him so many other spiritual truths He said it at the annual conference
of the Womens Liberal Federation Allow me to add that though they
didnt appreciate it I a mere man did He turns to the bookcase
again hoping that this may leave her crushed
PROSERPINE putting her hair straight at the little panel of mirror in
the mantelpiece Well when you talk to me give me your own ideas
such as they are and not his You never cut a poorer figure than when
you are trying to imitate him
LEXY stung I try to follow his example not to imitate him
PROSERPINE coming at him again on her way back to her work Yes you
do you IMITATE him Why do you tuck your umbrella under your left arm
instead of carrying it in your hand like anyone else Why do you walk
with your chin stuck out before you hurrying along with that eager
look in your eyesyou who never get up before half past nine in the
morning Why do you say knoaledge in church though you always say
knolledge in private conversation Bah do you think I dont know
She goes back to the typewriter Here come and set about your work
weve wasted enough time for one morning Heres a copy of the diary
for today She hands him a memorandum
LEXY deeply offended Thank you He takes it and stands at the table
with his back to her reading it She begins to transcribe her
shorthand notes on the typewriter without troubling herself about his
feelings Mr Burgess enters unannounced He is a man of sixty made
coarse and sordid by the compulsory selfishness of petty commerce and
later on softened into sluggish bumptiousness by overfeeding and
commercial success A vulgar ignorant guzzling man offensive and
contemptuous to people whose labor is cheap respectful to wealth and
rank and quite sincere and without rancour or envy in both attitudes
Finding him without talent the world has offered him no decently paid
work except ignoble work and he has become in consequence somewhat
hoggish But he has no suspicion of this himself and honestly regards
his commercial prosperity as the inevitable and socially wholesome
triumph of the ability industry shrewdness and experience in business
of a man who in private is easygoing affectionate and humorously
convivial to a fault Corporeally he is a podgy man with a square
clean shaven face and a square beard under his chin dust colored with
a patch of grey in the centre and small watery blue eyes with a
plaintively sentimental expression which he transfers easily to his
voice by his habit of pompously intoning his sentences
BURGESS stopping on the threshold and looking round They told me
Mr Morell was here
PROSERPINE rising Hes upstairs Ill fetch him for you
BURGESS staring boorishly at her Youre not the same young lady as
used to typewrite for him
PROSERPINE No
BURGESS assenting No she was younger Miss Garnett stolidly stares
at him then goes out with great dignity He receives this quite
obtusely and crosses to the hearthrug where he turns and spreads
himself with his back to the fire Startin on your rounds Mr Mill
LEXY folding his paper and pocketing it Yes I must be off presently
BURGESS momentously Dont let me detain you Mr Mill What I come
about is private between me and Mr Morell
LEXY huffily I have no intention of intruding I am sure Mr
Burgess Good morning
BURGESS patronizingly Oh good morning to you Morell returns as
Lexy is making for the door
MORELL to Lexy Off to work
LEXY Yes sir
MORELL patting him affectionately on the shoulder Take my silk
handkerchief and wrap your throat up Theres a cold wind Away with
you
Lexy brightens up and goes out
BURGESS Spoilin your curates as usul James Good mornin When I
pay a man an is livin depens on me I keep him in his place
MORELL rather shortly I always keep my curates in their places as my
helpers and comrades If you get as much work out of your clerks and
warehousemen as I do out of my curates you must be getting rich pretty
fast Will you take your old chair
He points with curt authority to the arm chair beside the fireplace
then takes the spare chair from the table and sits down in front of
Burgess
BURGESS without moving Just the same as hever James
MORELL When you last calledit was about three years ago I
thinkyou said the same thing a little more frankly Your exact words
then were Just as big a fool as ever James
BURGESS soothingly Well perhaps I did but with conciliatory
cheerfulness I meant no offence by it A clergyman is privileged to be
a bit of a fool you know its ony becomin in his profession that he
should Anyhow I come here not to rake up hold differences but to
let bygones be bygones Suddenly becoming very solemn and approaching
Morell James three year ago you done me a hill turn You done me
hout of a contrac an when I gev you arsh words in my natral
disappointment you turned my daughrter again me Well Ive come to
act the part of a Cherischin Offering his hand I forgive you James
MORELL starting up Confound your impudence
BURGESS retreating with almost lachrymose deprecation of this
treatment Is that becomin language for a clergyman Jamesand you
so particlar too
MORELL hotly No sir it is not becoming language for a clergyman I
used the wrong word I should have said damn your impudence thats
what St Paul or any honest priest would have said to you Do you
think I have forgotten that tender of yours for the contract to supply
clothing to the workhouse
BURGESS in a paroxysm of public spirit I acted in the interest of
the ratepayers James It was the lowest tender you cant deny that
MORELL Yes the lowest because you paid worse wages than any other
employerstarvation wagesaye worse than starvation wagesto the
women who made the clothing Your wages would have driven them to the
streets to keep body and soul together Getting angrier and angrier
Those women were my parishioners I shamed the Guardians out of
accepting your tender I shamed the ratepayers out of letting them do
it I shamed everybody but you Boiling over How dare you sir come
here and offer to forgive me and talk about your daughter and
BURGESS Easy James easy easy Dont git hinto a fluster about
nothink Ive howned I was wrong
MORELL fuming about Have you I didnt hear you
BURGESS Of course I did I hown it now Come I harsk your pardon for
the letter I wrote you Is that enough
MORELL snapping his fingers Thats nothing Have you raised the
wages
BURGESS triumphantly Yes
MORELL stopping dead What
BURGESS unctuously Ive turned a moddle hemployer I dont hemploy
no women now theyre all sacked and the work is done by machinery
Not a man as less than sixpence a hour and the skilled ands gits the
Trade Union rate Proudly What ave you to say to me now
MORELL overwhelmed Is it possible Well theres more joy in heaven
over one sinner that repenteth Going to Burgess with an explosion of
apologetic cordiality My dear Burgess I most heartily beg your
pardon for my hard thoughts of you Grasps his hand And now dont
you feel the better for the change Come confess youre happier You
look happier
BURGESS ruefully Well praps I do I spose I must since you
notice it At all events I git my contrax asseppit accepted by the
County Council Savagely They dussentave nothink to do with me
unless I paid fair wagescurse em for a parcel o meddlin fools
MORELL dropping his hand utterly discouraged So that was why you
raised the wages He sits down moodily
BURGESS severely in spreading mounting tones Why else should I do
it What does it lead to but drink and huppishness in workin men He
seats himself magisterially in the easy chair Its hall very well for
you James it gits you hinto the papers and makes a great man of you
but you never think of the arm you do puttin money into the pockets
of workin men that they dont know ow to spend and takin it from
people that might be makin a good huse on it
MORELL with a heavy sigh speaking with cold politeness What is your
business with me this morning I shall not pretend to believe that you
are here merely out of family sentiment
BURGESS obstinately Yes I hamjust family sentiment and nothink
else
MORELL with weary calm I dont believe you
BURGESS rising threateningly Dont say that to me again James Mavor
Morell
MORELL unmoved Ill say it just as often as may be necessary to
convince you that its true I dont believe you
BURGESS collapsing into an abyss of wounded feeling Oh well if
youre determined to be unfriendly I spose Id better go He moves
reluctantly towards the door Morell makes no sign He lingers I
didnt hexpect to find a hunforgivin spirit in you James Morell
still not responding he takes a few more reluctant steps doorwards
Then he comes back whining We huseter git on well enough spite of
our different opinions Why are you so changed to me I give you my
word I come here in pyorr pure frenliness not wishin to be on bad
terms with my hown daughrters usban Come James be a Cherishin and
shake ands He puts his hand sentimentally on Morells shoulder
MORELL looking up at him thoughtfully Look here Burgess Do you
want to be as welcome here as you were before you lost that contract
BURGESS I do James I dohonest
MORELL Then why dont you behave as you did then
BURGESS cautiously removing his hand Ow dymean
MORELL Ill tell you You thought me a young fool then
BURGESS coaxingly No I didnt James I
MORELL cutting him short Yes you did And I thought you an old
scoundrel
BURGESS most vehemently deprecating this gross selfaccusation on
Morells part No you didnt James Now you do yourself a hinjustice
MORELL Yes I did Well that did not prevent our getting on very well
together God made you what I call a scoundrel as he made me what you
call a fool The effect of this observation on Burgess is to remove
the keystone of his moral arch He becomes bodily weak and with his
eyes fixed on Morell in a helpless stare puts out his hand
apprehensively to balance himself as if the floor had suddenly sloped
under him Morell proceeds in the same tone of quiet conviction It
was not for me to quarrel with his handiwork in the one case more than
in the other So long as you come here honestly as a selfrespecting
thorough convinced scoundrel justifying your scoundrelism and proud
of it you are welcome But and now Morells tone becomes formidable
and he rises and strikes the back of the chair for greater emphasis I
wont have you here snivelling about being a model employer and a
converted man when youre only an apostate with your coat turned for
the sake of a County Council contract He nods at him to enforce the
point then goes to the hearthrug where he takes up a comfortably
commanding position with his back to the fire and continues No I
like a man to be true to himself even in wickedness Come now either
take your hat and go or else sit down and give me a good scoundrelly
reason for wanting to be friends with me Burgess whose emotions have
subsided sufficiently to be expressed by a dazed grin is relieved by
this concrete proposition He ponders it for a moment and then slowly
and very modestly sits down in the chair Morell has just left Thats
right Now out with it
BURGESS chuckling in spite of himself Well you ARE a queer bird
James and no mistake But almost enthusiastically one carnt elp
likin you besides as I said afore of course one dont take all a
clorgyman says seriously or the world couldnt go on Could it now
He composes himself for graver discourse and turning his eyes on
Morell proceeds with dull seriousness Well I dont mind tellin you
since its your wish we should be free with one another that I did
think you a bit of a fool once but Im beginnin to think that praps
I was beind the times a bit
MORELL delighted  Aha Youre finding that out at last are you
BURGESS portentously Yes times as changed morn I could a
believed Five yorr year ago no sensible man would a thought o
takin up with your ideas I hused to wonder you was let preach at all
Why I know a clorgyman that as bin kep hout of his job for yorrs by
the Bishop of London although the pore fellers not a bit more
religious than you are But today if henyone was to offer to bet me a
thousan poun that youll end by bein a bishop yourself I shouldnt
venture to take the bet You and yore crew are gettin hinfluential I
can see that Theyll ave to give you something someday if its only
to stop yore mouth You ad the right instinc arter all James the
line you took is the payin line in the long run fur a man o your sort
MORELL decisivelyoffering his hand Shake hands Burgess Now
youre talking honestly I dont think theyll make me a bishop but if
they do Ill introduce you to the biggest jobbers I can get to come to
my dinner parties
BURGESS who has risen with a sheepish grin and accepted the hand of
friendship You will ave your joke James Our quarrels made up now
isnt it
A WOMANS VOICE Say yes James
Startled they turn quickly and find that Candida has just come in and
is looking at them with an amused maternal indulgence which is her
characteristic expression She is a woman of 33 well built well
nourished likely one guesses to become matronly later on but now
quite at her best with the double charm of youth and motherhood Her
ways are those of a woman who has found that she can always manage
people by engaging their affection and who does so frankly and
instinctively without the smallest scruple So far she is like any
other pretty woman who is just clever enough to make the most of her
sexual attractions for trivially selfish ends but Candidas serene
brow courageous eyes and well set mouth and chin signify largeness of
mind and dignity of character to ennoble her cunning in the affections
A wisehearted observer looking at her would at once guess that
whoever had placed the Virgin of the Assumption over her hearth did so
because he fancied some spiritual resemblance between them and yet
would not suspect either her husband or herself of any such idea or
indeed of any concern with the art of Titian
Just now she is in bonnet and mantle laden with a strapped rug with
her umbrella stuck through it a handbag and a supply of illustrated
papers
MORELL shocked at his remissness Candida Whylooks at his watch
and is horrified to find it so late My darling Hurrying to her and
seizing the rug strap pouring forth his remorseful regrets all the
time I intended to meet you at the train I let the time slip
Flinging the rug on the sofa I was so engrossed byreturning to
herI forgotoh He embraces her with penitent emotion
BURGESS a little shamefaced and doubtful of his reception How ors
you Candy She still in Morells arms offers him her cheek which
he kisses James and me is come to a unnerstandina honourable
unnerstandin Ain we James
MORELL impetuously Oh bother your understanding Youve kept me
late for Candida With compassionate fervor My poor love how did
you manage about the luggagehow
CANDIDA stopping him and disengaging herself  There there there I
wasnt alone Eugene came down yesterday and we traveled up together
MORELL pleased Eugene
CANDIDA Yes hes struggling with my luggage poor boy Go out dear
at once or he will pay for the cab and I dont want that Morell
hurries out Candida puts down her handbag then takes off her mantle
and bonnet and puts them on the sofa with the rug chatting meanwhile
Well papa how are you getting on at home
BURGESS The ouse aint worth livin in since you left it Candy I
wish youd come round and give the gurl a talkin to Whos this Eugene
thats come with you
CANDIDA Oh Eugenes one of Jamess discoveries He found him sleeping
on the Embankment last June Havent you noticed our new picture
pointing to the Virgin He gave us that
BURGESS incredulously Garn Dyou mean to tell meyour hown
fatherthat cab touts or such like orf the Embankment buys picturs
like that Severely Dont deceive me Candy its a Igh Church
pictur and James chose it hisself
CANDIDA Guess again Eugene isnt a cab tout
BURGESS Then wot is he Sarcastically A nobleman I spose
CANDIDA delightednodding Yes His uncles a peera real live earl
BURGESS not daring to believe such good news No
CANDIDA Yes He had a seven day bill for 55 pounds in his pocket when
James found him on the Embankment He thought he couldnt get any money
for it until the seven days were up and he was too shy to ask for
credit Oh hes a dear boy We are very fond of him
BURGESS pretending to belittle the aristocracy but with his eyes
gleaming Hm I thort you wouldnt git a piorrs peers nevvy
visitin in Victoria Park unless he were a bit of a flat Looking
again at the picture Of course I dont old with that pictur Candy
but still its a igh class fust rate work of art I can see that Be
sure you hintroduce me to him Candy He looks at his watch
anxiously I can only stay about two minutes
Morell comes back with Eugene whom Burgess contemplates moisteyed
with enthusiasm He is a strange shy youth of eighteen slight
effeminate with a delicate childish voice and a hunted tormented
expression and shrinking manner that show the painful sensitiveness
that very swift and acute apprehensiveness produces in youth before
the character has grown to its full strength Yet everything that his
timidity and frailty suggests is contradicted by his face He is
miserably irresolute does not know where to stand or what to do with
his hands and feet is afraid of Burgess and would run away into
solitude if he dared but the very intensity with which he feels a
perfectly commonplace position shows great nervous force and his
