long before we die out and the Council will have the last laugh Old Red
Stone the Traitor of the War of Survival the little finger of my left
hand still missing and telling the Universe I was a very old soldier of
the outlawed Free Companies hanging onto life on a rocky planet of the
distant Salaman galaxy Back at the old stand because United Galaxies
still need us In a way its a big joke Two years after RajayBen and I
had a bellyfull of the Glorious War of Survival and they chased us all
the way out here they turned right around and made the peace A joke on
me but sometimes I like to think that our runout was the thing that
made them think and make peace When youve been a soldier for
thirtyfive years you like to win battles but you like to feel you
helped bring peace too
I said Personal integrity That sounds pretty good doesnt it So you
like personal integrity All right Saltario are you sure you know what
youre getting into Were 60 million light years from Galaxy Center 10
million from the nearest United Galaxy city Weve got no comforts no
future nothing to do but fight A woman in her right mind wont look at
us if they see you in uniform theyll spit on you if they catch you
out of uniform theyll kill you
Saltario shrugged I like to eat Ive got nowhere to go All Ive got
is myself and a big piece of ice I called home
I nodded Okay We fight small wars for good profits Its not Earth
out here but weve got four nice suns plenty of Lukanian whisky
RajayBen taught the locals to make and were our own masters The
United Galaxies leaves us pretty much alone unless they need us You do
your job and your job is what I tell you to do period You got that
straight
Saltario very nearly smiled It sounds good to me sir
I hope itll sound good in a year Saltario because once youre in you
dont get out except feet first Is that clear I have life and death
rights over you You owe allegiance to the Red Company and me and to no
one else Got that Today your best friends are the men of RajayBens
Lukanian Fourth Free Patrol and your worst enemies are the men of
Mandasivas Sirian O Company Tomorrow RajayBens boys may be your
worst enemies and Mandasivas troops your best friends It all depends
on the contract A Company on the same contract is a friend a Company
against the contract is an enemy Youll drink with a man today and
kill him tomorrow Got it If you kill a Free Companion without a
contract you go to courtmartial If you kill a citizen of the United
Galaxies except in a battle under contract I throw you to the wolves and
that means youre finished Thats the way it is
Yes sir Saltario never moved a muscle He was rigid
Right I said get your gear see the Adjutant and sign the
agreement I think youll do
Saltario left I sat back in my chair and thought about how many
nonEarthmen I was taking into the Company Maybe I should have been
thinking about this one single nonEarthman and the something he was
carrying inside him but I didnt and it cost the Companies thirty
thousand men we couldnt afford to lose We cant afford to lose one
man There are only a hundred Companies now twenty thousand men each
give or take a few thousand depending on how the last contract went
Life is good in the United Galaxies now that theyve disarmed and
outlawed all war again and our breed is dying out faster than it did in
the 500 years of peace before the War of Survival Too many of the old
Companions like me went west in the War of Survival The Galactic
Council know they need us know that you cant change all living
creatures into good Galactic citizens overnight so they let us go on
fighting for anyone in the Universe who wants to take something from
someone else or who thinks someone else wants to take something from
him And even the mighty United Galaxies needs guards for expeditions to
the unexplored galaxies But they dont like us and they dont want us
They dont cut off our little fingers anymore but we have to wear our
special black uniforms when we go into United territory under penalty of
a quick death Humane of course they just put us to sleep gently and
for keeps And theyve got a stockpile of ionic bombs ready at all times
in case we get out of hand We dont have ionic weapons thats part of
the agreement and they watch us They came close to using them down
there in the frozen waste of Menelaus XII but thirty thousand of us
died without ionics We killed each other They liked that even if they
didnt like what happened
Do you know what it means to be lost Really lost Im lost if that
means I know Ill never go back to live on Earth But I know that Earth
is still there to go back to and I can dream of going home Yuan
Saltario and the other refugees have no home to go back to They cant
even dream They sat in that one ship that escaped and watched their
planet turn into a lifeless ball of ice that would circle dead and
frozen forever around its burnedout star A giant tomb that carried
under its thick ice their homes and their fields and their loves And
they could not even hope and dream Or I did not think they could
Saltario had been with us a year when we got the contract to escort the
survey mission to NovaMaurania A private Earth commercial mining firm
looking for minerals under the frozen wastes of the dead planet
RajayBen was in on the contract We took two battalions one from my
Red Company and one from RajayBens Lukanian Patrol My SubCommander
was Pete Colenso old Mike Colensos boy It all went fine for a week or
so routine guard and patrol The survey team wouldnt associate with
us of course but we were used to that We kept our eyes open and our
mouths shut Thats our job and we give value for money received So we
were alert and ready But it wasnt the attack that nearly got us this
time It was the cold of the dead planet lost in absolute zero and
absolute darkness
NovaMaurania was nearly 40 percent uranium and who could resist that
A Centaurian trading unit did not resist the lure The attack was quick
and hard A typical Lukanian Patrol attack My Company was pinned down
at the first volley from those damned smoky blasters of the Lukanians
All I could see was the same shimmering lights I had learned to know so
well in the War of Survival against Lukania Someday maybe Ill find out
how to see a Lukan RajayBen has worked with me a long time to help
but when the attack came this time all I could do was eat ice and beam a
help call to RajayBen That Centaurian trading unit was a cheap outfit
they had hired only one battalion of ArjayBens Ninth Lukanian Free
Patrol and RajayBen flanked them right off that planet I got my boys
on their feet and we chased Arjays men half way back to Salaman with
RajayBen laughing like a hyena the whole way
Dip me in mud Red boy Id give a prime contract for one gander at old
ArjayBens face Hes blowing a gasket
I said Nice flank job
RajayBen laughed so hard I could see his pattern of colored light
shaking like a dancing rainbow I took two SubCommanders waitll I
hit that bullethead for ransom
Then we stopped laughing We had won the battle but ArjayBen was a
crafty old soldier and his sabotage squad had wrecked our engines and
our heating units We were stuck on a frozen planet without heat
Young Colenso turned white What do we do
I said Beam for help and pray we dont freeze first
They had missed our small communications reactor unit We sent out our
call and we all huddled around the small reactor There might be enough
heat out of it to let us live five hours If we were lucky It was the
third hour when Yuan Saltario began to talk Maybe it was the nearness
of death
I was twentytwo Portario was the leader on our planet He found the
error when we had one ship ready We had three days No time to get the
other ships ready He said we were lucky the other planets didnt have
even one ship ready Not even time for United Galaxies to help Portario
chose a thousand of us to go I was one At first I felt very good you
know I was really happy Until I found out that my wife couldnt go
Not fit enough United Galaxies had beamed the standards to us Funny
how you dont think about other people until something hurts you Id
been married a year I told them it was both of us or neither of us I
told Portario to tell United Galaxies they couldnt break up a family
and to hell with their standards They laughed at me Not Portario the
Council What did they care they would just take another man My wife
begged me to go She cried so much I had to agree to go I loved her too
much to be able to stay and see the look on her face as we both died
when she knew I could have gone On the ship before we took off I stood
at a port and looked down at her A small girl trying to smile at me
She waved once before they led her away from the rocket All hell was
shaking the planet already had been for months but all I saw was a
small girl waving once just once Shes still here somewhere down
there under the ice
The cold was slowly creeping into us It was hard to move my mouth but
I said She loved you she wanted you to live
Without her without my home Im as dead as the planet I feel frozen
Shes like that dead sun out there and Ill circle around her until
someone gets me and ends it Saltario seemed to be seeing something
Im beginning to forget what she looked like I dont want to forget I
cant forget her on this planet The way it was It was a beautiful
place perfect I dont want to forget her
Colenso said You wont have long to remember
But Colenso was wrong My Third Battalion showed up when we had just
less than an hour to live They took us off The Earth mining outfit
haggled over the contract because the job had not been finished and I
had to settle for twothird contract price RajayBen did better when he
ransomed ArjayBens two SubCommanders It wasnt a bad deal and I
would have been satisfied except that something had happened to Yuan
Saltario
Maybe it made him realize that he did not want to die after all Or
maybe it turned him spacehappy and he began to dream A dream of his
own born up there in the cold of his dead planet A dream that nearly
cost me my Company
I did not know what that dream was until Saltario came into my office a
year later He had a job for the Company
How many men I asked
Our Company and RajayBens Patrol Saltario said
Full strength
Yes sir
Price
Standard sir Saltario said The party will pay
Just a trip to your old planet
Thats all Saltario said A guard contract The hiring party just
dont want any interference with their project
Two full Companies Forty thousand men They must expect to need a lot
of protecting
United Galaxies opposes the project Or they will if they get wind of
it
I said United opposes a lot of things whats special about this
scheme
Saltario hesitated then looked at me with those flat black eyes
Ionics
Its not a word you say or hear without a chill somewhere deep
inside Not even me and I know a man can survive ionic weapons I know
because I did once Weapons so powerful Im one of the last men alive
who saw them in action Mathematically the big ones could wipe out a
Galaxy I saw a small one destroy a star in ten seconds I watched
Saltario for a long time It seemed a long time anyway It was probably
twenty seconds I was wondering if he had gone spacecrazy for keeps
And I was thinking of how I could find out what it was all about in time
to stop it
I said A hundred Companies wont be enough Saltario have you ever
seen or heard what an ionic bomb can
Saltario said Not weapons peaceful power
Even thats out and you know it I said United Galaxies wont even
touch peaceful ionics too dangerous to even use
You can take a look first
A good look I said
I alerted RajayBen and we took two squads and a small ship and Saltario
directed us to a tall mountain that jutted a hundred feet above the ice
of NovaMaurania I was not surprised In a way I think I knew from the
moment Saltario walked into my office Whatever it was Saltario was part
of it And I had a pretty good idea what it was The only question was
how But I didnt have time to think it out any farther In the
Companies you learn to feel danger
The first fire caught four of my men Then I was down on the ice They
were easy to see Black uniforms with white wedges Pete OHaras White
Wedge Company Earthmen I dont like fighting other Earthmen but a
jobs a job and you dont ask questions in the Companies It looked like
a full battalion against our two squads On the smooth ice surface there
was no cover except the jutting mountain top off to the right And no
light in the absolute darkness of a dead star But we could see through
our viewers and so could they They outnumbered us ten to one
RajayBens voice came through the closed circuit
Bad show Red they got our pants down
You call it I answered
Break silence
Surrender When a Company breaks silence in a battle it means surrender
There was no other way And I had a pretty good idea that the Council
itself was behind OHara on this job If it was ionics involved they
wouldnt ransom us The Council had waited a long time to catch Red
Stone in an execution offense They wouldnt miss
But forty of our men were down already
Okay I beamed over the circuit break silence Weve had it Rajay
Council offense Red
Yeah
Well Id had a lot of good years Maybe Id been a soldier too long I
was thinking just like that when the sudden flank attack started From
the right Heavy fire from the cover of the solitary mountain top
OHaras men were dropping I stared through my viewer On that mountain
I counted the uniforms of twentytwo different Companies That was very
wrong Whoever Saltario was fronting for could not have the power or the
gold to hire twentyfour Companies including mine and RajayBens And
the fire was heavy but not that heavy But whoever they were they were
very welcome We had a chance now And I was making my plans when the
tall old man stood up on the small jutting top of that mountain The
tall old man stood up and a translating machine boomed out
All of you OHaras men Look at this
I saw it In a beam of light on the top of that mountain it looked like
a small neutronsource machine But it wasnt It was an ionic beam
projector
The old man said Go home
They went They went fast and silent And I knew where they were going
Not to Salaman OHara would have taken one look at that machine and be
half way to United Galaxy Center before he had stopped seeing it I felt
like taking that trip myself But I had agreed to look and I would look
If we were lucky we would have fortyeight hours to look and run
I fell in what was left of my Company behind the men that had saved us
More Company uniforms than I had ever seen in one place They said
nothing Just walked into a hole in that mountain Into a cave And in
the cave at the far end a door opened An elevator We followed the
tall old man into the elevator and it began to descend The elevator car
went down for a long time At last I could see a faint glow far below
The glow grew brighter and the car stopped Far below the glow was still
brighter We all stepped out into a long corridor cut from solid rock I
estimated that we were at least two hundred miles down and the glow was
hundreds of miles deeper We went through three sealed doors and emerged
into a vast room A room bright with light and filled with more men in
Company uniforms civilians even women At least a thousand And I saw
it The thousand refugees all of them Gathered from all the Companies
from wherever they had been in the Galaxies Gathered here in a room
two hundred miles into the heart of their dead planet A room filled
with giant machines Ionic machines Highly advanced ionic power
reactors
The old man stood in front of his people and spoke I am Jason
Portario I thank you for coming
I broke in Ionic power is an execution offense You know that How the
hell did you get all this
I know the offense Commander Portario said and I know you Youre
a fair man Youre a brave man It doesnt matter where we got the
power many men are dead to get it but we have it and we will keep it
We have a job to do
I said After that stunt out there youve about as much chance as a
snowball in hell OHaras half way to Galaxy Center Look with a
little luck we get you out to Salaman If you leave all this equipment I
might be able to hide you until it blows over
The old man shrugged I would have preferred not to show our hand but
we had to save you I was aware that the Council would find us out
sooner or later they missed the ionic material a month ago But that is
unimportant The important matter is will you take our job All we need
is another two days perhaps three Can you hold off an attack for that
long
Why I asked
Portario smiled All right Commander you should know all we plan Sit
down and let me finish before you speak
I sat RajayBen sat The agitation of his colored lights showed that he
was as disturbed as I was The thousand NovaMauranians stood there in
the room and watched us Yuan Saltario stood with his friends I could
feel his eyes on me Hot eyes As if something inside that lost man was
burning again Portario lighted a pipe I had not seen a pipe since I
was a child The habit was classified as ancient usage in the United
Galaxies Portario saw me staring He held his pipe and looked at it
In a way Commander the old man said this pipe is my story On
NovaMaurania we liked a pipe We liked a lot of the old habits Maybe
we should have died with all the others You know I was the one who
found the error Sometimes Im not at all sure my friends here thank me
for it Our planet is dead Commander and so are we Were dead inside
But we have a dream We want to live again And to live again our planet
must live again The old man paused as if trying to be sure of telling
it right We mean no harm to anyone All we want is our life back We
dont want to live forever like lumps of ice circling around a dead
heart What we plan may kill us all but we feel it is worth the risk
We have thousands of ionic power reactors We have blasted out Venturi
tubes We found life still deep in the center of this planet It is all
ready now With all the power we have we will break the hold of our dead
sun and send this planet off into space We
I said Youre insane It cant
But it can Commander Its a great risk yes but it can be done my
calculations are perfect We want to leave this dead system go off into
space and find a new star that will bring life back to our planet A
green live warm NovaMaurania once again
RajayBen was laughing Thats the craziest damned dream I ever sat
still for You know what your chances of being picked up by another star
are Picked up just right Why
Portario said We have calculated the exact initial thrust the exact
tangential velocity the precise orbital path we need If all goes
exactly I emphasize exactly to the last detail as we have planned
it we can do it Our chances of being caught by the correct star in the
absolutely correct position are one in a thousand trillion but we can
do it
It was so impossible I began to believe he was right If you arent
caught just right
Portarios black eyes watched me We could burn up or stay frozen and
lifeless We could drift in space forever as cold and dead as we are now
and our ionic power wont last forever The forces we will use could
blow the planet apart But we are going to try We would rather die than
live as walking dead men in this perfect United Galaxies we do not
want
The silence in the room was like a Salaman fog Thick silence broken
only by the steady hum of the machines deep beneath us in the dead
planet A wild impossible dream of one thousand lost souls A dream
that would destroy them and they did not care There was something
about it all that I liked
I said Why not get Council approval
Portario smiled Council has little liking for wild dreams Commander
It would not be considered as advancing the future of United Galaxies
destiny Then there are the ionics And Portario hesitated And there
is the danger of imbalance Galactic imbalance I have calculated
carefully the danger is remote but Council is not going to take even a
remote chance
Yuan Saltario broke in All they care about is their damned sterile
destiny They dont care about people Well we do We care about
something to live for The hell with the destiny of the Galaxies They
dont know and well be gone before they do know
They know plenty now OHaras beamed them in
So we must hurry Portario said Three days Commander will you
protect us for three days
A Council offense punishable by instant destruction with United Galaxies
reserve ionic weapons in the hands of the supersecret police and
disaster teams And three days is a long time I would be risking my
whole Company I heard RajayBen laugh
Blast me Red its so damned crazy Im for it Lets give it a shot
I did not know then how much it would really cost us If I had I might
not have agreed Or maybe I would have it was good to know people could
still have such dreams in our computer age
Okay I said beam the full Companies and try to get one more
Mandasivas Sirian boys would be good Well split the fee three ways
Yuan Saltario said Thanks Red
I said Thank me later if were still around
We beamed the Companies and in twenty minutes they were on their way
Straight into the biggest trouble we had had since the War of Survival
I expected trouble but I didnt know how much Pete Colenso tipped me
off
Pete spoke across the light years on our beam Mandasiva says okay if
we guarantee the payment Ive deposited the bond with him and were on
our way But Red somethings funny
What
This place is empty The whole damned galaxy out here is like a desert
Every Company has moved out somewhere
Okay I beamed get rolling fast
There was only one client who could hire all the Companies at one time
United Galaxies itself We were in for it I had expected perhaps ten
Companies not three against 97 give or take a few out on other jobs
It gave me a chill Not the odds but if Council was that worried maybe
there was bad danger But Id given my word and a Companion keeps his
word We had one ace in the hole a small one If the other Companies
were not here in Menelaus yet they must have rendezvoused at Galaxy
Center It was the kind of followthebook mistake United would make
It gave us a day and a half We would need it
They came at dawn on the second day We were deployed across five of
the dead planets of Menelaus XII in a ring around NovaMaurania They
came fast and hard and Portario and his men had at least ten hours work
left before they could fire their reactors and pray Until then we did
the praying It didnt help
Mandasivas command ship went at the third hour A Lukan blaster got it
By the fourth hour I had watched three of my subcommand ships go A
Sirian force beam got one an Earth fusion gun got another and the
third went out of action and rammed OHaras command ship that had been
leading their attack against us That third ship of mine was Pete
Colensos Old Mike would have been proud of his boy I was sick Pete
had been a good boy So had OHara Not a boy OHara but the next to
the last of old Free Companion from Earth Im the last and I said a
silent goodbye to OHara By the sixth hour RajayBen had only ten
ships left I had twelve Five thousand of my men were gone Eight
thousand of RajayBens Lukans The Sirians of Mandasivas O Company
were getting the worst of it and in the eighth hour Mandasivas second
in command surrendered It would be over soon too soon And the dream
would be over with the battle I broke silence
Red Stone calling Do you read me Commander Stone calling Request
conference Repeat request conference
A face appeared on the interCompany beam screen The cold blank
hardbitten face of the only Free Company Commander senior to me now
that OHara was gone Jake Campesino of the Cygne Black Company Are
you surrendering Stone
No I want to speak to my fellow Companions
Campesinos voice was like ice Violation You know the rules Stone
Silence cannot be broken in battle I will bring charges Youre
through Stone
I said Okay crucify me later But hear me now
Campesino said Close silence or surrender
It was no good Wed had it And across the distance of battle
RajayBens face appeared on the screen The colored lights that were a
Lukans face and I knew enough to know that the shimmering lights were
mad The hell with them Red lets go all the damned way
And a new face appeared on the screen A face I knew too well First
Councillor Roark Stone Youve done a lot in your day but this is the
end you hear me Youre defending a madman in a Council crime Do you
realize the risk Universal imbalance The whole pattern of galaxies
could be destroyed Well destroy you for this Stone An ionic project
without Council authorization
I said to Campesino Five minutes Commander Thats all
There was a long blank on the screen then Campesinos cold face
appeared Okay Red talk I dont like civilian threats Youve got
your five minutes make it good
I made it good I told them of a handful of people who had a dream A
handful of people who wanted their home back A few lost souls who would
rather die trying to live the way they wanted to live than go on living
in a world they did not want And I told them of the great United
Galaxies that had been created to protect the dreams of everyone in it
and had forgotten why it had been created I told them that it did not
matter who was right or wrong because when a man can no longer dream
something has gone wrong in the Universe When I finished Campesinos
face was impassive
Campesino said You heard Commander Stone men Close off Stone give
me a minute to get the vote
I waited It was the longest minute of my life
You win Red Campesino said He was smiling at me Go home
Councillor battles over
The Councillor went He said there would be hell to pay and maybe there
will be but I dont think so they still need us We lost thirty
thousand good men in all the Companies But when the next dawn came
NovaMaurania was gone I dont know where they went or what happened
to them Here in my stronghold I sometimes imagine them safe and
rebuilding a green world where they can smoke pipes and live their own
lives And sometimes I imagine them all dead and drifting out there in
the infinity of space I dont think they would mind too much either
