By day he walked the streets seeing her name on every billboard
catching the glow of her subtle and changeful beauty in every window
She gazed out at him from brows weary with splendid barbaric jewels her
eyes bitter and disdainful and hopelessly sad She smiled at him in
framework of blue and ermine and pearlsthe bedecked heartless
coquette of the pleasureseeking world She stood in the shadow of gray
walls a grating over her head with deep soulful girlish eyes lifted
in piteous appeal and in each of these characters an unfathomed depth
remained to vex and to allure him
Magnified by these reflections on the walls haloed by the teeming
praise and censure of the press she seemed to dominate the entire city
as she had come to absorb the best of his own life What her private
character really was no one seemed to know in spite of the special
articles and interviews with her managers which fed the almost universal
adulation of her dark and changeful face her savage and sovereign
beauty There was insolence in her tread and mad allurement in the
rounded beauty of her powerful white armand at his weakest the young
playwright admitted that all else concerning her was of no account
At the same time he insisted that he was not involved with the
womanonly with the actress I am not a loverI am a playwright
eager to have my heroine adequately portrayed he contended with
himself in the solitude of his room high in one of the great apartment
buildings of the middle city Nevertheless the tremor in his nerves
caused him thought
Her voice Yes that too was mysterious Whence came that undertone
like the moan of a weary wastrel tortured with dreams of idyllic
innocence long lost Why did her utterance like her glorious face
always suggest some inner darker meaning There were times when she
seemed oldold as vice and cruelty hoarse with complaints with
curses and then again her lips were childishly sweet and her voice
carried only the wistful accents of adolescence or the melody of girlish
awe
On the night before his appointment she played The Baroness Telka a
lurid lustful remorseless womana creature with a vampires heart and
the glamour of Helen of Troya woman whose cheeks were still round and
smooth but whose eyes were alight with the flame of insanitya
frightful hungry soulless wretch And as he sat at the play and
watched that glittering inexplicable woman and thought of her roles
Douglass asked himself How will she meet me tomorrow What will be
the light in her eyes when she turns them upon me Will she meet me
alonehaughty weary with praise or will she be surrounded by those
who bow to her as to a queen This latter thing he feared
He had not been without experience with womeneven with actresses but
no woman he had ever met had appealed to his imagination beyond the
first meeting Would it be so with Helen Merival He had loved twice in
his life but not well enough to say so to either of his sweethearts
Around Myras name clung the perfume and moonlight of summer evenings in
the faroff midcontinent village where he was born while Violet
recalled the music the comfort and the security of a beautiful Eastern
home Neither of these sweet and lovely girls had won his heart
completely How was it that this woman of the blazoning billboards had
already put more of passion into his heart than they of the pure and
sheltered life
He did not deceive himself It was because Helen could not be understood
at a glance She appealed to his imagination as some strange birdalien
voyagerfled from distant islands in dim purple seas She typed the
dreams of adventuring youth seeking the princesses of other and more
romantic lands
At times he shuddered with a fear that some hidden decay of Helen
Merivals own soul enabled her to so horrify her audience with these
desolating roles and when the curtain fell on The Baroness he was
resolved to put aside the chance of meeting the actress Was it worth
while to be made ashamed and bitter She might stand revealed as a
coarse and selfish courtesana worn and haggard enchantress whose
failing life blazed back to youth only when on the stage Why be
disenchanted But in the end he rose above this boyish doubt What does
it matter whether she be true or false She has genius and genius I
need for my playgenius and power and in the delusion he rested
He climbed to his den in the tower as physically wearied as one
exhausted with running a race and fell asleep with his eyelids
fluttering in a feverish dream
The hour of his appointment with her fell upon Sunday and as he walked
up the street towards her hotel the bells in a church on a side street
were ringing and their chimes filled his mind with memories of the
small town from which he came How peaceful and sweet the life of
Woodstock seemed now The little meetinghouse whose shingled spire
still pointed at the stars would always be sweet with the memory of
Myra Thurber whose timid clasp upon his arm troubled him then and
pained him now He had so little to give in return for her
devotiontherefore he had given nothing He had said goodbye almost
harshlyhis ambition hardening his heart to her appeal
Around him in his dream of those faroff days moved other agile
formsyoung lovers like Myra and himself their feet creaking on the
glittering snow They stepped slowly though the bells called and
called The moonlight was not more clear and untouched of baleful fire
than Myras sweet eyes looking up at him and now he was walking the wet
pavement of the great metropolis with the clang and grind of cars all
about him on his way to meet a woman whose life was spent in simulating
acts as destructive as Myras had been serene and trustful At the
moment he saw his own life as a thread in some mysterious drama
To what does it lead he asked as he drew under the overhanging
portal of the great hotel where the star made her home It was to the
man of the West a splendid place Its builders had been lavish of highly
colored marbles and mosaics spendthrift of light and gilding on every
side shone the signs and seals of predatory wealth Its walls were like
costly confectionery its ornaments insolent its waste criminal Every
decorative feature was hot restless irreverent and cruel quite the
sort of avenue one might expect to find in his walk towards the
glittering woman of the false and ribald drama
She chose her abode with instinctive bad taste he said bitterly and
again his weakness his folly turned him cold for with all his physical
powers he was shy to the point of fear
He made a sober and singular spot in the blaze of the rotunda So sombre
was his look so intent his gaze Youths in high hats and shining
shirtfronts stood in groups conversing loudly and in the resplendent
dininghall bediamonded women and their sleekhaired heavyjewelled
partners were eating leisurely attended by swarms of waiters so eager
they trod upon one anothers feet
The clerk eyed him in impassible silence as he took out his worn
cardcase saying Please send my card to Miss Merival
Miss Merival is not receiving any one this evening the clerk
answered with a tone which was like the slap of a wet glove in the
face
Douglass faced him with a look which made him reflect You will let her
be the judge of that he said and his tone was that of one accustomed
to be obeyed
The little man bowed Oh certainly Mr Douglass but as she left
orders
When the boy with his card had disappeared into the candycolored
distances the playwright found himself again studying the face of his
incomprehensible sorceress who looked down upon him even at that moment
from a bulletinboard on the hotel wall Oriental savage and
sullensad too as though alone in her solitary splendor She cant
be all of her partswhich one of them will I find as I enter her room
he asked himself for the hundredth time
Miss Merival will see Mr Douglass said the bellboy This way
sir
As he stepped into the elevator the young mans face grew stern and his
lips straightened out into a grim line It was absurd to think he should
be so deeply moved by any woman alive he who prided himself on his
selfpossession
Down a long hall on the tenth floor the boy led him and tapped at a
door which was opened after a pause by a quiet woman who greeted him
with outstretched hand kindly cordial
How do you do Mr Douglass It is very good of you to come she said
with the simplest inflection
This must be an elder sister he thought and followed her into a
large sittingroom where a grayhaired woman and a young man were
sipping afterdinner coffee
Mother this is Mr Douglass the author of The Modern Stage the
little book of essays we liked so well The elderly lady greeted him
cordially but with a timid air And this is my brother Hugh the
young man gave Douglasss hand a firm and cordial grip
Sit down pleasenot thereover here where the light will fall on
you I want to see how you look she added in smiling candor and with
that smile he recognized in his hostess the great actress
He was fairly dazed and for the moment entirely wordless From the very
moment the door had opened to him the glittering woman had been
receding into remote and ever remoter distances for the Helen Merival
before him was as simple candid and cordial as his own sister Her
voice had the home inflection she displayed neither paint nor powder
her hair was plainly brushedbeautiful hair it was tooand her dress
was lovely and in quiet taste
Her face seemed plain at first just as her stature seemed small She
was dark but not so dark as she appeared on the stage and her face was
thinner a little careworn it seemed to him and her eyesthose
leering wicked eyeswere large and deep and soft Her figure was
firm compact womanly and modest in every line No wife could have
seemed more of the home than this famous actress who faced him with
hands folded in her lap
He was stupefied Suddenly he perceived the injustice and the crass
folly of his estimate of her character and with this perception came a
broader and deeper realization of her greatness as an actress Her real
self now became more complex than his wildest imagined ideal of her
That this sweet and reflective girl should be the actress was as
difficult to understand as that The Baroness should be at heart a good
woman For five minutes he hardly heard what she said so busy was his
mind readjusting itself to this abrupt displacement of values With
noiseless suddenness all the lurid light which the advertiser had
thrown around the star died away The faces which mocked and mourned
the clutching hands the lines of barbaric ornaments the golden goblets
of debauchery the jewelled daggers the poison phialsall those
accessories designed to produce the siren of the posters faded out
and he found himself face to face with a human being like himself a
thoughtful selfcontained and rather serious American girl of
twentysix or twentyeight years of age
Not merely this but her attitude towards him was that of a pupil She
lifted eyes to him as to one occupying an intellectual height She began
to tell him how much she enjoyed his little book on the drama which a
friend had recommended to her but as soon as he had fairly recovered
himself he led her away from his own work I am supposed to be an
architect he explained I write of the stage because I love itand
because I am a failure in my profession My book is a very slight and
unambitious attempt
But you know the stage and its principles she insisted and your
view of the future is an inspiration to those of us who wish to do good
work Your letter was very helpful to me for I am deeply discouraged
just now I am disgusted with the drama in which I work I am weary of
these unwholesome parts You are quite right I shall never do my best
work so long as I am forced to assume such uncongenial roles They are
all false every one of them They are good acting roles as acting
goes but I want plays that I can live as well as act But my manager
tells me that the public will not have me in anything else Do you think
they would Is he right She ended in appeal
I think the public will take you at your best in anything you do he
replied with grave gallantry I dont know that managers are
omniscient They are only men like the rest of us
She smiled That is high treason but Im very much inclined to believe
it is true I am willing to concede that a theatre must be made to pay
but I am not content to think that this splendid art is always to be
measured by the number of dollars which fall into the boxoffice Take
Westervelt as a type What ideals has he None whatever save to find a
play that will run forever and advertise itself
She had dreams too it seemed She glowed with her plans and as she
timidly presented them Douglass perceived that the woman was entirely
unconscious of the false glamour the whirling light and tumult which
outsiders connected with her name At the centre of the illumination she
sat looking out upon the glorified billboards the gay shop windows
the crowded auditoriums a wholesome kindly intelligent woman subject
to moods of discouragement like himself unwilling to be a slave to a
moneygrubber Something in his face encouraged the story of her
struggles She passed to her personal history while he listened as one
enthralled
The actress fled and the woman drew near She looked into the mans
eyes frankly unshrinkingly with humor with appeal She leaned towards
him and her face grew exquisitely tender and beautiful Oh it was a
struggle Mother kept boarders in order that Hugh and I might go to
schooldidnt you dear old muz She laid her hand on her mothers
knee and the mother clasped it Fathers health grew worse and worse
and at last he died and then I had to leave school to help earn our
living I began to read for entertainments of various sorts Father was
a Grand Army man and the posts took an interest in my reading I really
earned a thousand dollars the second year I doubled that the next year
and considered myself a great public success She smiled Mother may
I let Mr Douglass see how I looked then
The mother nodded consent and the great actress after a few moments
search returned with a package of circulars each bearing a piquant
girlish face
There she said as she handed them to Douglass I felt the full
ecstasy of power when that picture was taken In this I wore a new gown
and a new hat and I was earning fifty dollars at each reading My
success fairly bewildered me but oh wasnt it glorious I took mother
out of a tenement and put her in a lovely little home I sent Hugh to
college I refurnished the house I bought pictures and rugs for you
know I continued to earn over two thousand a year And what fun we had
in spending all that money
But how did you reach the stage he asked
She laughed By way of the Kerosene circuit if you know what that
means
Ive heard the phrase he answered it corresponds to the oldtime
barnstorming doesnt it
It does
Hugh interposed I wouldnt go into that sis
Why not Its great funnow I used to think it pretty tragic
sometimes Yes I was nineteen when I went on the New England rural
circuitto give it a better name Oh Ive been through all the steps
As soon as I felt a little secure about mother I ventured to New York
in answer to advertisements in The Reflector and went out on the
road at fifteen per These slang phrases seemed humorous as they
came from her smiling lips but Douglass knew some little part of the
toil and discomfort they stood for
Her eyes danced with fun I played The Lady of Lyons in a kitchen
set and the deathscene in East Lynne before a wood drop And my
costumes were something marvellous werent they mother Well this
lasted two seasonssummer seasons while I continued to read in winter
in order to indulge my passion for the stage in summer and early autumn
Then I secured a small part in a real company and at a salary that
permitted me to send some money home I knocked about the country this
way two seasons morethat makes me twentytwo I knew the office of
every manager in New York by this time but had been able to reach an
audience with but one or two They were kind enough but failed to see
anything in me as the phrase goes and I was quite disheartened Oh
the Rialto Her face clouded and her voice softened It is a
brilliant and amusing place to the successful but to the girl who walks
it seeking a theatrical engagement it is a heartless and cruel place
You can see them there todaygirls eager and earnest and ready to work
hard and conscientiouslyhaunting the agencies and the anterooms of the
managers just as I did in those daysonly five years ago
It seems incredible exclaimed Douglass I thought you came here from
a London success
So I did and that is the miraculous chapter of my story I went to
London with Farnumwith only a little partbut McLennan saw me and
liked my work and asked me to take the American adventuress in his new
play And thenmy fortune was made The play was only a partial
success but my own position was established I continued to play the
gay and evilminded French and Russian woman of the English stage till I
was tired of them Then I tried Joan of Arc and Charlotte Corday
The public forced me back to The Baroness Telka and to wealth and
great fame and then I read your little book which seemed directed
straight to me and I asked Hugh to write younow you have the story
of me life I have had no struggle sinceonly hard work and great
acclaim She faced her mother with a proud smile Then her face
darkened Butthere is always a butI want New York to know me in
some better way Im tired of these women with cigarettes and spangled
dinnergowns
She laid her hand again on her mothers knee and the gentle old fingers
closed around the firm smooth wrist
Ive told mother that I will cut these roles out We are at last in a
position to do as we please I am now waiting for something worth while
to come to me That is my present situation Mr Douglass I dont know
why Ive been so frank Now let me hear your play
He flushed a little To tell the truth I find it rather hard to begin
I feel as though I were reenacting a wornout scene in some way Every
other man in the car writes plays nowadays and torments his friends by
reading to them which I admit is an abominable practice However as
I came here for that express purpose I will at least outline my
scenario
Didnt you bring the play itself
Yes but really I hesitate It may bore you to death
You could not write a play that would bore meI am sure of that
Very well he soberly answered and drew forth his manuscript As if
upon signal the mother and her son rose to withdraw You are entirely
justified said Douglass with some humor I quite understand your
feelings
We should like very much to hear it but
No excuses I beg of you I wonder at Miss Merivals hardihood I am
quite sure she will live to repent her temerity
In this spirit of banter the playwright and the star were left alone
with the manuscript of the play As he read on Douglass was carried out
of his own impassivity by the changes in the face before him It became
once more elusive duskily mysterious in its lines A reflective shadow
darkened the glorious eyes veiled by drooping lids Without knowing it
the actress took on from moment to moment the hearttrials of the woman
of the play In a subconscious way even as he read Douglass analyzed
and understood her power Hers was a soul of swift and subtle sympathy
A word a mere inflection was sufficient to set in motion the most
complicate and obscure conceptions in her brain permitting her to
comprehend with equal clarity the Egyptian queen of pleasure and the
austere devotee to whom joy is a snare From time to time she uttered
little exclamations of pleasure and at the end of each act motioned him
to proceed as if eager to get a unified impression
It was after eleven oclock when he threw down the manuscript and
white with emotion awaited her verdict She was tense with the strain
and her lashes were wet with tears but her eyes were bright and her
mind alert She had already entered upon a new part having been swept
up into a region of resolution as far away from the pleasant hostess as
from the heartless adventuress whose garments she had worn but the night
before With hands clasped between her knees and shoulders laxly
drooping she brooded on the sorrows of his mimic world
I will do your play she said at last I will do it because I believe
in its method and because I think it worthy of my highest powers
The blood rushed to the playwrights throat and a smarting heat dimmed
his eyes He spoke with difficulty I thank you he said hoarsely
It is more than I expected and now that you have promised to do it I
feel you ought not to take the risk He could say no more overcome by
the cordial emphasis of her decision
There is a risk I will be frank with you but your play is worth it I
have not been so powerfully moved in years You have thrilled me Really
I cannot tell you how deeply your theme has sunk into my heart You have
the Northern conscienceso have I that is why I rebel at being merely
the plaything of a careless public Yes I will do your play It is a
work of genius I hope you wrote it in a garret Its the kind of thing
to come from a diet of black bread and water
He smiled I live in a sort of garret and my meals are frequently
beans and brown bread I hope that will do
I am glad the bread is at least brown But you are tired Leave the
manuscript with me He rose and she moved towards him with a gesture
of confidence which made words impossible to him When we meet again I
want you to tell me something of yourself Goodnight You will hear
from me soon She was regal as she said thisregal in her own proper
person and he went away rapt with wonder and admiration of the real
Helen Merival as she now stood revealed to him
She is greater than my dreams of her he said in a sort of rapture as
he walked the street She is greater than she herself can know for her
genius is of the subtle unspeakable deepsbelow her own consciousness
beyond her own analysis How much greater her art seems now that I have
seen her It is marvellous She will do my play and she will
succeedher power as an actress would carry it to a success if it were
a bad play which it is not My day has dawned at last
Helen went to bed that night with a consciousness that something new and
powerful had come into her life Not merely the play and her
determination to do it moved herthe man himself profoundly impressed
her His seriousness his decision and directness of utterance and the
idealism which shone from his rugged boyish face remained with her to
the verge of sleep He was very handsome and his voice singularly
beautiful but his power to charm lay over and beyond these His sincere
eyes his freedom from flippant slang these impressed her with a sense
of his reliability his moral worth
He is stern and harsh but he is fine she said to her mother next
morning and his play is very strong I am going to do it You will
like the part of Lillian It has the Scotch sense of moral
responsibility in it
II
Douglass rose next morning with a bound as if life had somehow become
surcharged with fresh significance fresh opportunity His professional
career seemed dull and prosaichis critical work of small avail His
whole mind centred on his play
His was a moody sensitive nature Stern as he looked and strong as he
really was he could be depressed by a trifle or exalted by a word And
reviewing his meeting with Helen in the light of the morning he had
more than a suspicion that he had allowed himself to talk too freely in
the presence of the brother and mother and that he had been
overenthusiastic not to say egotistic but he was saved from dejection
by the memory of the stars great brownblack eyes There was no
pretence in them She had been raptcarried out of conventional words
and graces by something which rose from the lines he had written the
characters he had depicted
The deeper his scrutiny went the more important she became to him She
was not simpleshe was very complex and an artist of wonderful range
and certainty of appeal He liked the plain and simple almost angular
gestures and attitudes she used when talking to him They were so
broadly indicative of the real Helen Merival and so far from the
affectations he had expected to see Of course she was the actressthe
mobility of her face her command of herself was far beyond that of any
untrained woman no matter how versatile but she was nobly the actress
broadened and deepened by her art
He was very eager to see her again and as the day wore on this desire
grew to be an ache at his heart most disturbing He became very restless
at last and did little but walk around the park returning occasionally
as the hour for the postman came I dont know why I should expect a
letter from her I know well the dilatory methods of theatrical
peopleand today is rehearsal too I am unreasonable If I hear from
her in a week I may count myself lucky
A message from the dramatic editor of The Blazon asking him to do a
special study of an English actor opening that night at the Broadway
annoyed him I cant do it he answered I have another engagement
And recklessly put aside the opportunity to earn a weeks board so
exalted was he by reason of the word of the woman
At dinner he lacked appetite entirely and as he had taken but an egg
and a cup of coffee for breakfast and had missed luncheon altogether
he began to question himself as to the meaning of his ailment with sad
attempt at humor It isnt exactly as serious as dying Even if she
reconsiders and returns my play I can still make a living He would
not admit that any other motive was involved
He had barely returned to his room before a knock at the door announced
a boy with a note As he took it in his hand his nerves tingled as
though he had touched the wondrous womans hand The note was brief yet
fateful
I enclose a ticket for the managers box I hope you can come I
want to talk about your play I will send my brother to bring you
in back to see me I have been rehearsing all the afternoon but I
reread the play this morning while in bed I like it better and
better but you can do more with itI feel that you have
suppressed the poetry here and there My quarrel with you realists
is that you are afraid to put into your representations of life the
emotions that make life a dynamic thing But it is stirring and
suggestive as it is Come in and talk with me for I am full of it
and see great possibilities in the final act
His hands were tremulous and his eyes glowing as he put the note down
and faced himself in the glass The pleasure of meeting her again under
such conditions made him forget for the moment the role she was to
playa part he particularly detested Truly he was the most fortunate
and distinguished of mento be thus taken by the hand and lifted from
nameless obscurity to the most desired position beside a great star
He dressed with unusual care and was a noticeably handsome figure as he
sat alone in the box and elated tense selfconscious When she came
on and walked close down to the footlights nearest him flashing a
glance of recognition into his eyes his breath quickened and his face
flushed A swift interchange of light and fire took place at the moment
her eyelids fell She recoiled as if in dismay then turned and
apparently forgot him and every one else in the fervor of her art
A transforming readjustment of all the lines of her face took place She
became sinister mocking and pitiless An exultant cruelty croaked in
her voice Minute repulsive remodellings of her neck and cheeks changed
her to a harpy and seeing these evidences of her great genius Douglass
grew bitterly resentful and when she laughed with the action of a
vulture thrusting her head forward from the shoulders he sickened and
turned away It was marvellous work but how desecrating to her glorious
womanhood Coming so close on that moment of mystic tenderness it was
horrible My God She must not play such parts They will leave their
mark upon her
When the curtain fell he did not applaud but drew back into the shadow
sullen brooding sorrowful In the tableau which followed the recall
her eyes again sought for him though she still moved in character
and the curtain fell upon the scene while yet she was seeking him
Here now began a transformation in the man He had come to the theatre
tremulous with eagerness to look upon her face to touch her hand but
when her brother entered the box saying Mr Douglass this is the
best time to see my sister he rose slowly with a curious reluctance
Through devious passages beneath the theatre Hugh led the way while
with greater poignancy than ever before the young playwright sensed the
vulgarity the immodesty and the dirt of the world behind and below the
scenes It was all familiar enough to him for he had several friends
among the actors but the thought of one so sovereign as Helen in the
midst of a region so squalid stung him He was jealous of the actors
the sceneshifters who were permitted to see her come and go
He was reserved and rather pale but perfectly selfcontained as he
entered the little receptionhall leading to her dressingroom He
faced her with a sense of dreadapprehensive of some disenchantment
She met him cordially without the slightest reference to her makeup
which was less offensive than he had feared but he winced
nevertheless at the vulgarity of her part so skilfully suggested by
paint and powder She gave him her hand with a frank gesture You
didnt applaud my scenes tonight she said with a smile as enigmatic
as the one she used in The Baroness
His voice was curt with emotion as he replied No I did not I
couldnt They saddened me
What do you mean she asked with a startled anxious paling beneath
her rouge
His voice was low but fiercely reproachful in answer I mean you
should treat your beautiful self and your splendid art with greater
consideration
You mean I should not be playing such women I know itI hate them
But no one ever accused me of taking my art lightly I work harder on
these uncongenial roles than upon any other They require infinitely
more effort because I loathe them so
I mean more than that I am afraid to have you simulate such passions
They will leave their mark on you It is defilement Your womanhood is
too fine too beautiful to be so degraded
She put her hand to her bosom and looked about her restlessly His
intensity scared her I know what you mean but let us not talk of that
now let us discuss your play I want to suggest something for your
third act but I must dress now You will wait wont you We will have
a few minutes before I go on Please sit here and wait for me
He acquiesced silently as was his fashion There was little of the
courtier about him but he became very ill at ease as he realized how
significant his waiting must seem to those who saw him there Deeply in
the snare as he was this sitting beside an actresss dressingroom door
became intolerable to his arrogant soul and he was about to flee when
Hugh came back and engaged him in conversation So gratified was
