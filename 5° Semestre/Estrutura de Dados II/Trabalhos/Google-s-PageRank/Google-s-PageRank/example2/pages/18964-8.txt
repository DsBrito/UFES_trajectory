CHAPTER I
OPEN HOUSE AT PERE MARQUETTES
Mid June and the eager spring had burst triumphant into the North
Woods  The mountain tops still white hostages of the retreating
winter fettered in frozen manacles were alone in their reminiscence
of the implacable season  And even they made their joyous offerings to
the newborn springtime pouring a thousand flashing cascades to leap
down the rocky sides and seek out the hidden nooks and valleys where
seeds were bursting and the thawed earth lay fruitful under warm lush
grass  The birds were back from their southern voyaging once more the
squirrels chattered in the open noisily forgetful of the rigours of
winter in the joy of green things growing and in the clear blue arch
of the sky the sun wheeled gloriously through a long day  The air
always wine was now a sparkling bubbling rare vintage champagne
dancing in the blood making laughter in the heart and sweet tumult in
the brain  It was the season of long golden days of clear silver
nights of budding life everywhere
Because of three unmistakable signs did even the most sceptical of the
handful of hardy spirits at MacLeods Settlement know that in truth the
spring had come  They read the welcome tidings in the slipping of the
snows from the flinty fronts of Ironhead and Indian Peak a thousand
feet above the greening valley in the riotous din of squirrels and
birds interwoven with the booming of frogs from the still ponds and
finally in the announcement tacked upon the postoffice door  The two
line scrawl in lead pencil did not state in so many words the same
tidings which the blue birds were proclaiming from the thicket on the
far bank of the Little MacLeod it merely announced that tonight Pere
Marquette and his beloved wife Mere Jeanne were keeping open house
Every one in the Settlement knew what that meant just as well as he
understood the significance of the noises of the ice splitting upon the
ponds
Once every year until now this was the fiftieth had such an
announcement appeared  Not always upon the door of the postoffice
for when the announcements began there was no postoffice in MacLeods
Settlement  But annually at the chosen time set apart by the season
and himself Pere Marquette would appear upon the little narrow street
earlier than the earliest cock his bright eye up at old Ironhead
towering high above him rub his chin complacently turn his head
sidewise so that he might hearken to the thin voices of the wild
creatures and then his message tacked up return to the private room
behind his store to kiss Mere Jeanne awake and inform her with grave
joy that their jour de lan had come to them  Then and with much
frolicking and wine and music would their new year begin
It is our anniversary msieu he would say with an air of vast
confidence to the first man he met upon the street  Tonight we keep
open house here  He would wave his hand toward the long low log
building clay chinked  We will be proud of your presence and that of
your friens
It had been remarked that the anniversary had come one year upon the
twentysixth of May another year as late as the last of June  Pere
Marquette had laughed softly and had shaken his head  What matter
he had demanded  I I marry myself with my beloved Mamselle Jeanne
the first fine day of spring  Voila
The central door of the Marquette house broadest and heaviest and most
conspicuous both from its position in the middle of its valiant line of
brothers had been closed and barred since last night  It gave
entrance to the store here behind his long counter peering over boxes
neatly piled or between great heaps of bacon and tobacco and mens
clothing Pere Marquette looked out upon the world some three hundred
and sixtyfour days of the ordinary year  But upon the first day of
spring it was closed and locked until noon  If a man needed plug cut
for his pipe why then let him borrow from his friend or steal from his
enemy it was no concern of Pere Marquette  If a woman required flour
for her baking let her do without it would serve her right for having
failed to remember the great day     Then at high noon not
measured by any ticking clock in the Settlement the matter being
decided by Pere Marquette and the sun alone the middle door was flung
open  The old man dressed in his best black suit his newest skull
cap set like a crown upon his head stood at one side of the entrance
gravely courteous his black eyes twinkling twin withered roses in his
old cheeks  Mere Jeanne silver buckles on her shoes her ample form
surrounded almost but not quite by a great white stiffstarched apron
a bouquet of flowers in one hand took her place at the other side
And then the guests began to arrive
You could list the men women children and four footed live stock of
MacLeods Settlement upon a printed page and still have room left for a
brief biography of each  They all came all dressed in their best
holiday raiment all happy and eager for the celebration  From far
down the Little MacLeod river men trod the slushy trails rough fellows
for the most part and silent but with a tongue in each head to propose
a toast to host and hostess  From over the ridge from French Valley
from as far east as St Croix and as far west as Dunvegans Post the
guests trooped in  Miners trappers little stock men scions of old
French families with grand names descendants of younger English sons
with riotous blood Americans who had crossed the border with much
haste and scant baggage many men whom the world had outlawed and whom
the North Woods had accepted as empire builders men of pure blood
knocking elbows with swarthy breeds oddly alike in the matters of
keenly alert eyes and magnificent bodies
As they filed through the Frenchmans door they entered not the store
at all but what was Pere Marquettes idea of a drawing room  The long
counters and shelves were there but the barrels of pickled meat the
piles of soap and tinned meats the bags of flour the stacks of mens
clothing all this had been whisked away and out of sight as though by
magic  A strip of new red oilcloth upon one counter a strip of blue
upon another transformed both into auxiliary seats  Benches recently
brought in from the rear storeroom by Pere Marquettes man Jules and
freshly dusted by him lined the walls  Even Mere Jeannes bedroom had
been robbed of chairs boxes dressed gaily in gingham or perchance even
flaunting remnants of chintz were amply good enough for the boys and
girls
My frien you do me the honour said Pere Marquette over and over as
some stranger upon whom his quick black eyes had never rested until now
accepted his hand and entered to be again welcomed by Mere Jeanne
You make mamma and me ver happy
Let the frontier push out as far and as fast as it pleases the violin
always goes with it  Men march the more intrepidly to the scraping of
the skilful bow  There were two fiddles already going in the next
room Pere Marquette had seen to that  And in the same room stood a
great sturdy homemade table crippled in one leg yet standing
valiantly like an old soldier home from the wars  Mere Jeannes own
plump hands had placed the best tablecloth upon it and there in its
nest of field flowers was the great bowl which had been the most
serviceable of the handful of wedding gifts fifty years ago  Since the
crisp sting had not yet gone out of the air the high red tide in the
bowl was steaming an invitation which was irresistible
Long before one oclock all of the Settlement had arrived each one had
had his bit of the heady punch small glasses for the women great
pewter mugs many times refilled for the men  The big bowl was
proverbially like the purse of Fortunatus in its scorn of emptiness
Mere Jeanne ceremoniously replenished it time and again carried
brimming cups to the fiddlers and the merry music having ceased just
long enough for the musicians to gulp down Your health went on more
inspiringly than before  Heavy booted feet moving rythmically made
the dance a thing to hear as well as see deep throated laughter boomed
out incessantly the lighter fewer voices of women weaving in and out
of the clamour
All afternoon men came in now and then a woman with them  They drank
and ate they smoked Pere Marquettes tobacco from the jars set about
everywhere they traded old news for new and new for old they
speculated upon the coming thaws and trapping to be found down on the
Little MacLeod and up towards the Silver Lake country they told of the
latest gold strike in the Black Bear hills and predicted fresh strikes
to be made before the thaw was ten days old  Many types of men and
women some no doubt good some bad no doubt all mingling freely
At five oclock Pere Marquette cleared his voice scrambled with rare
agility upon one of his own counters and made the expected announcement
Ah my friens you make us ver happy me an Mamma Jeanne  We wish
our leetle house she was more big today big like our heart that she
can hold the whole worl  He hugged his thin old arms to his breast
and smiled upon them  Tonight all night long mes amis you are
welcome  The doors of Pere Marquette have forgot how to close up
tonight  But listen one instant  Jus across the road my warehouse
she is open  The violins have gone there  There you may dance dance
as Mamselle Jeanne an I dance it is fifty year tonight  Dance all
night long  And while the yong folk whose hearts are in their heels
walse yonder here we older ones     Ah as sudden voices
cheering cut into his running words  You have not forgot eh
It was the signal for division  The few women who had children took
them home with them the other women young and old following like a
holiday flotilla in the wake of Mere Jeanne tacked through the muck of
the road to the warehouse many of the younger and some few of the
older men followed them and in the house of Pere Marquette in the
yellow light of a half dozen kerosene lamps and many tall candles the
real affair of the evening began
Great logs oozing molten pitch were burning noisily in the two rock
fireplaces the red flames swept up into the blackened chimneys to
spread cheer within and to scatter sparks like little stars in the
clear night without the punch bowl had at last been allowed to stand
empty not because men were through drinking but because stronger drink
mens drink had appeared in many bottles upon the shelves a game of
poker was running in one corner of a room a game of solo in another
yonder seen through an open door six men were shaking dice and
wagering little and bigger sums recklessly a little fellow with a
wooden leg and a terribly scarred face was drawing shrieking rag time
from an old and asthmatic accordion while four men their big boots
clumping noisily upon the bare floor danced like awkward trained bears
when the outer door closed against the chill of the evening was flung
open and a stranger to MacLeods settlement stood a moment framed
against the outside night  A score of eyes going to him swiftly
studied him with unhidden curiosity
CHAPTER II
THE COMING OF NOLUCK DRENNEN
All sorts and conditions of men come to the North Woods some because
they want to some because they have to  Some because they are drawn
by the fine lure of adventure and the urge of the restless spirit some
because they are driven by that bloodhound which is the law  All
types all classes  And yet now standing jauntily upon Pere
Marquettes threshold was a type of which as yet the Settlement had
had no knowledge
He was young and wore his black mustaches with all of the fierceness of
youth  His boots were at once the finest and the smallest which
MacLeods had ever seen upon a mans feet  He wore gloves and when in
due time the hands came out of the gloves they were little like a
womans and white and soft  He was a handsome young devilofafellow
with all of the soft graceful beauty of the far southland  His mouth
smiling now was red lipped his teeth a glistening white  Eyes very
big very black very soft very tender smiling too  From the crown
of his wide black hat to the tall heels of his dainty boots he was such
a dandy as demanded more than a casual glance
Amigos he cried the door closed now his back to it his wide hat
describing a slow graceful arc as he raised it gallantly from his
black hair I have the thirst of a lost soul  Who will drink with me
He whipped the glove from his right hand caught his hat under his arm
and brought from his pocket a shining gold piece which he tossed to one
of Pere Marquettes counters  A few of the men laughed seeing his
mistake while others murmured Dago a little disgustedly and
returned their attention to their drink gaming or talk  Pere
Marquette came forward briskly
Msieu he said graciously offering his hand your presence honours
Mamma Jeanne an me  We are tonight fifty year marry    you shall
put your money in your pocket msieu  One does not pay to drink at
the place of Pere Marquette tonight
The young fellow looked at him in surprise then turned wondering eyes
about him even peering through the open door into the further rooms as
though asking himself what manner of place was this where men drank and
did not pay  Then he laughed softly
Your pardon senor he said politely taking the old mans proffered
hand and bending over it gracefully  Outside I was athirst like a man
in hell
A queer change came over his smiling face as his eyes journeying
beyond the thin black coated figure of Pere Marquette rested upon a
secluded corner of the room where in the nook by the fireplace a quiet
game of cards was in progress
Senorita  Senorita he cried softly pushing by Pere Marquette and
coming forward swiftly  Dispensame  Forgive me senorita
It was Ernestine the one woman remaining in the room Ernestine
Dumont who had come from over the ridge with big Kootanie George her
latest lover  She was sitting close to Kootanies side now whispering
occasionally in his ear as a hand was dealt him for the most part
contentedly sipping at her little glass of sweet wine as she sat back
and watched  She with the others had turned toward the entrant her
eyes remaining upon him until now  She smiled no doubt pleased at his
notice while Kootanie George wideshouldered mighty limbed the
biggest man within a hundred miles of the Settlement glared at him in
frowning wonder
Forgive you laughed Ernestine after a quick glance at George upon
whose shoulder she laid her hand lightly  What for
I did not know that a lady was here explained the young fellow
eagerly  He was almost standing over her his eyes for her alone as he
turned up his mustaches more fiercely yet and his eyes grew the more
tender  I speak roughly and not guarding my tongue which should
suffer and not taste wine for a week senorita  I am ashamed
Ernestine blushed again several men had laughed  He had said hell
and had apologised to her
Well let it go this time she laughed a trifle awkwardly  And as
for not drinking anything     Look out or youll spill what Papa
Marquette is bringing you now
We are all friens msieu said Papa Marquette courteously offering
a brimming glass  You too  And it is wrong that one should thirst
tonight
The other took the glass with another of his graceful bows
May you have other fifty years of happiness with your senora he said
warmly  Your health and her health senor  The glass at his lips
halted and came away for a moment while he thought to introduce
himself  I am Ramon Garcia
He said it as one might have said I am the King of Spain Simply
enough but with a proud simplicity  Then he put back his head and
drank
After that Ramon Garcia needed no coaxing to remain  He fitted into
the throng as he seemed to do all things gracefully  Since he could
not spend his money tonight for wine and since spend it he must he
ventured it pleasantly at the table where the dice rolled  Between
throws he made many slender cigarettes of fine tobacco and thin white
papers winning he forgot to note how much in turning his eyes with
tender admiration upon Ernestine Dumont whose glance more than once
met his losing he hummed languid snatches of Mexican love songs in a
remarkably pure tenor voice
Before he had been with them an hour it was evident to many not last
of all to big Kootanie George that the Mex was flirting openly with
the yellow haired Ernestine  It was equally evident that his notice
did not embarrass her as his apology had done  She curved her red lips
at him when George was not looking she glanced down as demure as a
bashful school girl when her big lover was watching her  George began
to lose at his cards and when he swore at his luck did not apologise
At last Ramon Garcia wearied of the dice  He pocketed his winnings and
pushed back his chair  A guitar in its case in a corner of the room
had caught his roving eye  Standing with his back to the wall leaning
indolently he sent his white fingers wandering across the strings and
his eyes drifting bade to find those of Ernestine Dumont  Then through
the discordance of other voices of clicking chips rustling cards
dice snapped down upon the hard table tops chink of glass and bottle
neck the voice of Ramon Garcia liberated softly filled the room with
its richness as a room is filled with the perfume of flowers  Such
music as he made did not often come into the North Woods and men
and one woman    listened
He sang it in the Spanish a tongue which no other man here understood
Yet they must all guess the meaning of the words  They were love
words tenderly lilted  And they were being sung to Ernestine Dumont
There was a little smile upon young Ramons lips a hint of gay
laughter in his voice and in his soft eyes a deal of love making
Kootanie George scowled Ernestine twirled her glass in her fingers
one or two men laughed
When he had done Ramon Garcia swept his fingers across the strings in a
sort of mournful regret  Then when there was a sudden clapping of
hands he bowed smiled and sang again this time putting the words of
his little song the same song into English
The perfume of roses of little red roses
Thou art a rose oh so sweet corazon
The laugh of the water who falls in the fountain
Thou art the fountain of love corazon
The brightness of stars of little stars golden
Estrella de mi vida  My little life star
The shine of the moon through the magnolia tree
I am so sad till thou come mi amor
Dios It is sweet to be young and to love
More sweet than wine    to be young and to love
In the clapping of hands which broke out when he had done Ernestines
was to be heard above Kootanie Georges grunt of disgust
No man talk that he snorted careless of who heard  Dam slush
Your deal Koot laughed Blunt Rand the American trapper from the
headwaters of the Little MacLeod  Dont let the Mexican gent spoil
your play thataway  Deal em up why dont you
Kootanie George glared at Rand and gathered in the cards  He
understood as did Ernestine and the others at the table the gibe which
lay under Rands words  The Americans fancies too had run toward
Ernestine Dumont not so long ago and she had not deigned to take
notice of him after the coming of Kootanie
Mexican gent huh said George slowly  If you mean Greaser why
dont you say Greaser
Ramon Garcia had again approached the table  He stopped suddenly as
Georges snarl came to him and his white teeth showed for a quick
flash under his lifted lip  Then his eyes smiling darkly he came on
again bending intimately over Ernestines chair
They are dancing over there he said softly  Will you dance with
me senorita
George merely looked at them sidewise  Ernestine glanced up sharply
and for a moment indecision stood easily readable in her eyes  Then
she shook her head
Not now she said quietly  Maybe after a while  I dont know
Anyway not now
Gracias senorita  He thanked her quite as though she had taken
his proffered arm  And turning away he went back to the game of dice
and his wine glass  Kootanie laughed
Better look out for him Koot grinned Blunt Rand  Them kind carry
cold steel sharp on both edges  They get it between your shoulder
blades and then twist it  Its awful uncomfortable
Rand had drunk his share of toasts to the eternal joy of the Marquettes
and the drinking had given to his tongue a wee bit of recklessness to
his heart a little venom  Out of a clear sky his words falling
crisply through the little silence he demanded of no one in particular
and in all seeming innocence
Whats happened to Noluck Drennen  I aint seen him here of late
Kootanie George turned his head slowly and stared at him  Rand was
fingering his cards his eyes hastily busied with their corners
George turned from him to Ernestine  She bit her lips and a spurt of
red leaped up into her cheeks  Her eyes met his a moment steely and
hard  Then they went to Blunt Rand as bright and hateful as twin
daggers
The man upon Rands right started to laugh  He altered his mind as
Kootanie Georges eyes turned slowly upon him and changed the laugh to
a cough behind his hand  Nobody offered to answer the question it was
accepted as one of those utterances put into the form of an
interrogation merely for rhetorical reasons and requiring no reply
For it was common talk through the camps that Noluck Drennen had done
the impossible and gotten blood from a turnip in other words that he
had drawn love out of the heart of Ernestine Dumont  And it was known
that the miracle had been a twin wonder in that Drennen had refused to
see and when he had at last seen had refused to accept  Ernestines
love had been like Ernestine herself reckless  And yes Drennen had
laughed at her  He had told her brutally that he had no more use for a
woman in his life than he had for a cat  Certainly not for a woman
like her  His words had been given after Drennens fashion like a
slap in the face  All this had been less than a year ago
Elated at the success with which his words had met Blunt Rand laughed
Again Kootanie George looked at him steadily
What are you lookin for Drennen for he asked quietly
Oh nothin rejoined the other lightly  Only when I come through
Little Smoky the other day an ol flame of his asked about him  The
Fire Bird they call her  Know her
Ernestine Dumonts face grew a shade redder in its mortification even
while she knew that the man was lying to tease her  Then she sat back
with a little gasp and even slow moving Kootanie George turned quickly
as a heavy voice called from the door
Youre a liar Blunt Rand
It was Noluck Drennen just come in and standing now his hat far back
upon his head his hands upon his hips staring across the room at
Blunt Rand
CHAPTER III
THE MAN UNDER THE CLOAK
Dave Drennen was a big man no man here so big save Kootanie George
alone who was two inches the taller and fully thirty pounds the
heavier  The Canadian stood four inches better than six feet in his
squat lowheeled boots and must turn sideways to get his massive
shoulders through most doors hereabouts  Unlike most very tall men
George carried himself straight his enormous chest thrust forward
Drennen was younger by half a dozen years slenderer of cleaner build
Any man at Pere Marquettes would have emptied his pockets that night
to witness a fight between the two  Men as a rule liked Kootanie
George slow moving slow spoken heavily good humoured  And as an
even more unbroken rule they disliked Dave Drennen  Throughout the far
places of the great northwest into which of recent years he had fitted
restlessly he was known as a man at once too silent and too
quarrelsome  He trod his own trail alone  Other men had pardners
Drennen was no mans friend  He was hard and he was bitter  Not yet
at the end of his first score and ten his mouth had grown set in
stern harsh lines his heavy brows had acquired the habit of bunching
ominously over eyes in which was the glint of steel  He was a man
whose smile was unpleasant whose laugh could be as ugly as many a
mans curse
It looked like a quarrel between Noluck Drennen and Blunt Rand  And
yet the men who ceased their playing at the snap of his voice forgot
Rand and hungered for trouble between Drennen and Kootanie George
Rand had been measured long ago and didnt count  He blabbed big words
when he was drunk and whined when a man struck him  He would swallow
his words now and swallow with them Noluck Drennens vicious Youre a
liar Blunt Rand  Even if Drennen slapped his face he would merely
crawl away like a little bug spitting venom
Drennen was standing ten feet from him and made no move to draw closer
Did you hear me Rand he demanded sharply
I heard you grumbled the trapper  Whats eatin you Dave anyway
Tell them you lied
Rand flushed and inspired by his liquor a sudden unusual stubbornness
sprang up in his eyes  He heard Ernestine laugh softly
You go to hell he cried hotly  I got a right
No man has a right to lie about me announced Drennen crisply  The
big hands at his sides had clenched swiftly with knotting muscles  At
last he took a quick step forward his quarrelsome mood riding him
If you dont want me to choke the tongue out of your head tell them
you lied
Messieurs messieurs cried poor old Marquette imploringly  For
the love of God  Tonight all mus be gay all mus be friens  It is
the night Mamma Jeanne an me we are marry fifty year
Drennen snarled at him shaking the thin old hand away angrily  Rand
was upon his feet some of the stubbornness already fled from his eyes
the sound of Ernestine Dumonts taunting laugh lost to him in the harsh
voice of Drennen
I dont want no trouble tonight Dave he said swiftly  Its old
Papa Marquettes weddin night  I    I was jus joshin Dave
And then as Ernestine laughed again he spat out Jus joshin to
tease Ernestine here
Sangre de dios murmured Ramon Garcia gently his black eyes liquid
fire  He is a little coward that Rand
Hardly more than a whisper and Garcia quite across the room from Rand
And yet the stillness was so perfect that Rand heard and jerked his
head up swinging toward the Mexican
You little Greaser he cried shrilly  You dirty breed you  He
pushed through the crowd to Garcias table  Coward am I  Ill show
you
Ramon Garcias laughter greeting the hot words was a clear burst of
unaffected boyish merriment  He tilted his chair back against the
wall and turned a delighted face up to Rands flushed one
Senor he chided softly shaking a slender white finger very close to
Rands nose have you forgot it is the gala night of our good host
the Papa Francais  That you dont care for trouble tonight  Mama
mia  You are a comicno
Then bringing his hand away and hooking both thumbs impudently into the
armholes of his gay vest the Mexican smiled as he hummed softly
glancing away briefly to where Ernestine Dumont was watching them
The perfume of roses of little red roses
Thou art a rose oh so sweet corazon
With men laughing at him Blunt Rand struck  The young Mexican was
still in his chair  Like a cat he slipped from it now avoiding the
heavy swinging blow moving to one side with swift gracefulness
standing with the table between him and Rand  As he moved his right
hand slid into his pocket
You dago Rand shouted at him lunging forward while men scrambled
out of the way  Call me coward an then go for your knife  Fight
with your hands damn you
Again Garcia avoided him easily calm and quick eyed offering
pantherine swiftness against the blind fury of Rand
Si senor he answered lightly  With the hands  But the hands I
mus keep without dirt senor
His hand came away from his pocket and he made a sudden gesture still
laughing toward Rands face  The trapper jerked back quickly  Then a
great booming swell of laughter went up even the slow rumble of
Kootanie Georges voice and the tinkling tremulo of Ernestine Dumonts
joining it Ramon Garcia had brought out his gloves and had drawn them
on before Rand had understood
In size and physique Rand was the average there  The young Mexican was
the shortest slightest man in the house  But none knows better than
the dwellers in the North Woods that it is unwise to judge men by mere
size of body  It is well to look to the eyes of ones antagonist
Garcia sprang forward and slapped Rands face so that the face burned
and the sound of the blow was like a pistol shot in the quiet room
And as Rands return threshing blow sought him he sprang away laughing
For calling me Greaser he cried lightly  When I have said out loud
that I am Ramon Garcia
Bellowing curses Rand charged at him again  Garcia avoided and seemed
to have no difficulty whatever in so doing
Will you open the door senor he called to a man standing near the
entrance
He wants to have an open trail to run jeered Rand  And again
striking heavily his blow found the empty air and a second resounding
slap reddened his other cheek
For calling me a breed taunted Garcia so that all might hear the
words with the slap of the open hand  Me who have the blood of kings
blue like the skies
The man standing at the door    it chanced to be young Frank
Marquette    obeyed Garcias command silently and promptly  Rand
his rage flaring ever higher as men drawing chairs and tables out of
the way laughed at him and as the Mexicans sallies taunted him hurled
himself forward purposing to get his enemy in a corner of the room
But at the best the trapper was awkward and Ramon Garcias little feet
in his little boots carried him much as the fabled winged sandals bore
the hero Perseus in his encounter with the dragon  Not once had Rand
