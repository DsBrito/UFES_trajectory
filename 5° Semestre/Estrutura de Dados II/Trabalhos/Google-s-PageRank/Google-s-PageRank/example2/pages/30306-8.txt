and suggestive relationship between creeds and symbols that were once
believed to have nothing in common But beyond these fields of research
there is at least one other that has hitherto been denied the attention
it richly deserves When the anthropologist has described those
conditions of primitive culture amid which he believes religious ideas
took their origin and the comparative mythologist has shown us the
similarities and interrelations of widely separated creeds religious
beliefs have yet to submit to the test of a scientific psychology the
function of which is to determine how far the same principles apply to
all phases of mental life whether religious or nonreligious Moreover
in addition to the normal psychical life of man there is that vast
borderland in which the normal merges into the abnormal and the healthy
state into a pathologic one That there is a physiology of religion is
now generally admitted but that there is also a pathology of religion
is not so generally recognised The present work seeks to emphasise this
last aspect It does not claim to be more than an outline of the
subjecta sketch map of a territory that others may fill in more
completely
From another point of view the following pages may be regarded as an
attempt more completely to apply scientific principles to religious
beliefs And it would be idle to hope that such an attempt could be made
without incurring much hostile criticism In connection with most other
subjects the help of science is welcomed in connection with religion
science is still regarded as more or less of an intruder profaning a
sacred subject with vulgar tests and impertinent enquiries This must
almost inevitably follow when one has to face the opposition of
thousands of men who have been trained to regard themselves as the
authorised exponents of all that pertains to religion but whose
training fails to supply them with a genuine scientific equipment It
should however be clear that an attitude of hostility to science
veiled or open cannot be maintained Mere authority has fallen on evil
days and in all directions is being freely challenged There is
increasing dislike to systems of thought that shrink from examination
and to conclusions that cannot withstand the most rigorous
investigation And if science really has anything of value to say on
this question it cannot be held to silence for ever Sooner or later the
need for its assistance will be felt and the selfelected authority of
an order must give way It is moreover impossible for science with its
claim sometimes avowed but always implied to cover the whole of life
to forego so large a territory as that of religion For there can be no
reasonable question that religion has played and still plays a large
part in the life of the race Whatever be the nature of religion
science is bound either to deal with it or confess its main task to be
hopeless
Whether or not it is possible to apply known scientific principles to
the whole of religion will be a matter of opinion but the attempt is at
least worth making So much that appeared to be beyond the reach of
science has been ultimately brought within its ken so many things that
seemed to stand in a class by themselves have been finally brought under
some more comprehensive generalisation and so become part of the
cosmic machine that one is impelled to believe that given time and
industry the same will result here And it should never be forgotten
that one aspect of scientific progress has been the taking over of large
tracts of territory that religion once regarded as peculiarly its own
and just as psychology and pathology were found to hold the key to an
understanding of such a phenomenon as witchcraft so we may yet realise
that a true explanation of religious phenomena is to be found not in
some supernatural world but in the workings of natural forces
imperfectly understood
The defences set up by theologians against the scientific advance may be
summarised under two heads It is claimed that the facts of the
religious life belong to a world of inner experience to a state of
spiritual development which brings the subject into touch with a
supersensuous world not open to the normal human being and with which
science as ordinarily understood is incompetent to deal In essence
this is a very old position and contains the kernel of mysticism in
all ages from the savage state onward This position involves a very
obvious begging of the question at issue It assumes that all attempts
to correlate religious phenomena with phenomena in general have failed
and that all future attempts are similarly doomed to failure Of course
nothing of the kind has been shown On the contrary the aim of the
present work is to show that no dividing line can be drawn between those
states of mind that have been and are classed as religious and those
that are admittedly nonreligious For various reasons I have dealt
almost entirely with those conditions that are admittedly pathological
but I believe it would be possible to prove the same of all normal
frames of mind and emotional states Any human quality may be enlisted
in the service of religion but there are none that are specifically
religious It is a pure assumption that the religious visionary
possesses qualities that are either absent or rudimentary in other
persons Human faculty is everywhere identical although the form in
which it is expressed differs according to education the presence of
certain dominating ideas and the general influence of ones
environment To admit the claim of the mystic is to surrender all hope
of a scientific coordination of life It is quite fatal to the
scientific ideal and involves the reintroduction into nature of a
dualism the removal of which has been one of the most marked advantages
of scientific thinking
Moreover whatever views we may hold as to the ultimate nature of mind
the dependence of all frames of mind upon the brain and nervous system
is now generally accepted We may hold various theories as to the nature
of mind we may with the late William James treat the brain as merely
a transmissive organ but even on that assumptionon behalf of which
not a shred of positive evidence has been offeredthe frames of mind
expressed are determined by the nervous mechanism and thus the laws of
mental phenomena become ultimately the laws of the operation of the
nervous system The facts of the religious life thus become part of
the facts of psychology as a whole Its laws will form part of
psychological laws as a whole and religious experiences must be handed
over for examination and classification to the psychologist who in turn
relies for help and understanding on various associated branches of
science
Closely allied to the claim of the mystic that his experiences bring
him into touch with a world of supersensuous reality is the attempt to
prove that science is incapable of dealing with anything but in the
first place the endless ascertainment of facts and the physical
conditions under which they occur and in the second place to the
criticism of error Well no one denies that it is part of the work of
science to ascertain facts or even that its work consists in
ascertaining facts and framing laws that will explain them But why
are we to limit science to physical facts only All facts are not
physical If I have a headache the unpleasant feeling is a fact If I
feel hot or cold angry or pleased think one thing ugly or another
beautiful my feelings are as much facts as anything else that exists
Nay if I fancy I see a ghost or a vision these also are facts so
far as my mental state at the time is concerned So also are my beliefs
about all manner of things and often the most important facts with
which I am connected Facts may be objective or subjective They may
exist in relation to all minds normally constituted or they may exist
in relation to my own mind only or yet again they may exist only in
relation to certain states of mind but they do not nevertheless cease
to be facts
Now the business of science is to collect factsall factsclassify
them and frame generalisations that will explain their groupings and
modes of operation It talks of the facts of the physical world the
facts of the biological world the facts of the psychological world and
so forth This last group comprises all sorts of feelings and ideas
beliefs and experiences Some of these facts it calls false others it
calls truethat is they are true when they hold good of all men and
women normally constituted they are not true when they hold good of
isolated individuals only and can be seen to be the product of
misinterpreted experience or arise from a derangementpermanent or
temporaryof the nervous system But true or false they remain facts of
the mental life They must be collected grouped and explained exactly
as other facts are collected grouped and explained They fall within
the scope of science to be dealt with by scientific methods
There is really no escape from the position that so far as religious
facts are parts of mental life religion becomes logically a
department of psychology The substantial identity of all mental facts
is quite unaffected by their being directed to this or that special
object As mental facts they are part of the material that it is the
work of science to reduce to order And as mental facts religious
phenomena are seen to follow the same laws that govern mental
phenomena in general It is perfectly true that we cannot test and
measure the material of psychology with the same definiteness and
accuracy that the chemist applies to the subjectmatter of his
department but that may be due to want of knowledge or to the extreme
complexity and variability of the matter with which we are dealing And
if it were true that the same tests could not be applied in psychology
that are applied elsewhere this would be no cause for scientific
despair It would only mean that fresh tests would have to be devised
for a new group of facts as every other science has already as a
matter of fact created its own special standard of value
The second of the two lines of defence consists in the bold assertion
that the religious interpretation of subjective phenomena is itself in
the nature of a true scientific induction The methods of science are
not repudiated but welcomed But it is argued that the nonreligious
explanation of religious phenomena breaks down hopelessly while the
religious explanation fully covers and explains the facts If this were
true nothing more remains to be said and we must accept this dualistic
scheme however repugnant it may be to orthodox scientific ideas But is
it true Is it a fact that the nonreligious explanation breaks down so
completely Hitherto the course of events has been in the contrary
direction It is the religious explanation that has over and over
again been shown to be unreliable the nonreligious explanation that
has been finally established Insanity and epilepsy once universally
ascribed to a supernatural order of being have been reduced to the
level of nervous disorders All the phenomena of possession are still
with us it is only our understanding of them that has altered And
before it is admitted that the phenomena described as religious can
never be affiliated to the phenomena described as nonreligious it must
be shownbeyond all possibility of doubtthat their explanation in
terms of known forces is impossible As I have said in the body of this
work the question at issue is essentially one of interpretation The
facts of the religious life are admitted Science no more questions
the reality of the visions of the medieval mystic than it questions the
visions of the nonmystic admittedly suffering from neural derangement
The crucial question is whether we have any good reason for separating
the two and while we dismiss the one as hallucination accept the other
as introducing us to another order of being I do not think there is the
slightest ground for any such differentiation and I have given in the
following pages what I conceive to be good reasons for so thinking And
I hope that the fact of the explanations there offered running counter
to the traditional one will not prevent readers weighing with the utmost
care the proofs that are offered
RELIGION AND SEX
CHAPTER ONE
SCIENCE AND THE SUPERNATURAL
Accepting Professor Tylors famous minimum definition of religion as
the belief in Spiritual Beings it is safe to say that religious
belief constitutes one of the largest facts in human history No other
single subject has occupied so large a share of mans conscious life no
other subject has absorbed so much of his energy In very early stages
of culture religious belief is universal in the fullest sense of the
word It shapes all primitive institutions it dominates life from the
cradle to the grave and creates a shadowland beyond the grave from
which the dead continue to influence the actions of the living At a
later stage of culture we see a distinction being drawn between the
natural and the supernatural the secular and the spiritual and the
beginning of an antagonism that is still with us Of all antagonisms
conceived by the brain of man this is the deepest and the most
irreconcilable Each feels that the growth of the other threatens its
own supremacy with the result that advance from either side has been
contested with the greatest obstinacy and determination And although it
is true that at present the supernatural is very largely suspect it
is still powerful Nor is its influence confined to the lower strata of
European society It has very many representatives among the higher
culture disguised it may be under various pseudophilosophic forms
Altogether we may say that the supernatural has never been without its
cloud of witnesses At all times there have been individuals or
groups of individuals who have believed themselves and have been
believed by others to be in touch with another order of existence than
that with which people are normally in contact And apart from these
specially favoured persons the wide vogue of the belief in good and
evil portents in lucky and unlucky days the attraction of the occult
in fiction and in fact all serve as evidence that belief in the
supernatural is still a force with which one has to reckon
To what causes are we to attribute the persistence of this belief in the
supernatural It is useless replying that its persistence is evidence of
its truth That clearly begs the whole question at issue Mere social
heredity will doubtless count for much in this direction Men do not
start their thinking afresh with each generation It is based upon that
of preceding generations it follows set forms and is generally
influenced by that network of ideas and beliefs into which we are born
and from which none of us ever completely escapes Still that is hardly
enough in itself to account for the persistence of supernaturalism
Assuming that originally there existed what was accepted as good
evidence for the existence of a supernatural it is hardly credible that
every subsequent generation went on accepting it merely because one
generation received evidence of its existence As organs atrophy for
want of exercise so do beliefs die out in time for want of proof Some
kind of evidence must have been continually forthcoming in order to keep
the belief alive and active It is not a question of whether the
evidence was good or bad All evidence it is important to bear in mind
is good to some one The facts upon which thousands of people were put
to death for witchcraft would not be considered evidence to anyone
nowadays but they were once accepted as good ground for conviction
What kind of evidence is it then that has been accepted as proof of
the supernatural Or to return to Tylors definition of religion
seeing that the belief in spiritual beings has persisted in every
generation upon what kind of evidence has this belief been nourished
Various replies might be given to this question all of which may
contain some degree of truth or an aspect of a general truth In the
present enquiry I am concerned with one line of investigation only one
that has been strangely neglected but which yet I am convinced
promises fruitful results In other directions it has been established
that a great aid to an understanding of the human organism in times of
health is to study its activities under conditions of disease Abnormal
psychology is now a recognised branch of psychology in general and a
glance through almost any recent textbook will show that the two form
parts of a natural whole The normal and the abnormal are in turn used
to throw light on each other And it appears to the present writer that
in the matter of religious beliefs a much clearer understanding of their
nature and also of some of the conditions of their perpetuation may be
gained by a study of what has happened and is happening in the light
of mental pathology
To some of course the bare idea of there being a pathology of religion
will appear an entirely unwarrantable assumption On the other hand the
scientific study of all phases of religions having made so great headway
it is hoped that a larger number will be prepared for a discussion of
the subject from a point of view which if not quite new is certainly
not common Of course such a discussion even if the author quite
succeeds in demonstrating the truth of his thesis will still leave the
origin of the religious idea an open question For the present we are
not concerned directly with the origin of the religious idea but with
an examination of some of the causes that have served to perpetuate it
and to trace the influence in the history of religion of states of mind
both personal and collective that are now admittedly abnormal or
pathological in character The legitimacy of the enquiry cannot be
questioned As to its value and significance that every reader must
determine for himself
One may put the essential idea of the following pages in a
sentenceGiven the religious idea as already existing in what way
and to what extent has its development been affected by forces that are
not in themselves religious and which modern thought definitely
separates from religion
Under civilised and uncivilised conditions we find religious beliefs
constantly associated with various forcessocial ethical and
psychological Very seldom is there any serious attempt to separate them
and assign to each their respective value nor indeed is the task at
any time an easy one The difficulty is made the greater by the way in
which writers so enlarge the meaning of religion that it is made to
include almost everything for which one feels admiration or respect
This practice is neither helpful nor accurate Human nature under all
aspects of intellectual conviction presents the same fundamental
characteristics and a definition to be of value while of necessity
inclusive must also be decisively exclusive It must unite but it must
also separate And many current definitions of religion while they may
bear testimony to the amiability of those who frame them are quite
destitute of scientific value In any case the association of the
religious idea with nonreligious forces is a fact too patent to admit
of denial and the important task is to determine their reciprocal
influence In actual life this separation has been secured by the
development of the various branches of positive thoughtethics
psychology etc all of which were once directly under the control of
religion What remains to be done is to separate in theory what has
already been separated in fact with such additions as a more critical
knowledge may suggest as advisable
Far more suggestive however than the association of religion with what
we may call the normal social forces is its connection with conditions
that are now clearly recognised as abnormal From the earliest times we
find the use of drugs and stimulants the practice of fasting and
selftorture with other methods of depressing or stimulating the action
of the nervous system accepted as wellrecognised methods of inducing a
sense of religious illumination or the feeling that one is in direct
communion with a supernatural order of existence Equally significant is
the worldwide acceptanceright up to recent timesof purely
pathological states as evidence of supernatural intercourse About these
two sets of facts there can be no reasonable doubt Over and over again
we can observe how the promptings of disease are taken for the voice of
divinity and men and women who today would be handed over to the care
of the physician hailed as an incarnation of deity In modern asylums
we find one of the commonest of delusions to be that of the insane
person who imagines himself to be a specially selected instrument of
deity In such instances the causal influence of pathological conditions
is admitted On the other hand we have belonging to the more normal
type the person who claims a supernatural origin for many of his actions
and states of mind And between these two extremes lie a whole series of
gradations They exist in all stages of culture and it is difficult to
see by what rule of logic or of experience one can say where the normal
ends and the abnormal begins If we assume the inference of the normal
person concerning the origin of his mental states to be correct it
seems difficult to deny the possibility of those of the insane person
having a similar origin although distorted by the influence of disease
If on the other hand we say the insane person is wholly wrong as to
the origin of his mental states may we not also assume that the normal
person has likewise erred as to the cause of his emotions or ideas
Two considerations may be urged in support of this conclusion In the
first place there is the fact of the fundamental identity of human
qualities under all conditions of their manifestation It is too often
assumedsometimes it is explicitly claimedthat one with what is
called a strong religious nature possesses some quality of mind absent
or undeveloped in those of an opposite type This assumption is quite
unwarrantable The religious man is marked off from the nonreligious
man not by the possession of distinct mental qualities but solely by
holding different ideas concerning the cause and significance of his
mental states There is no such thing as a religious faculty but
only qualities of mind expressed in terms of the religious idea If I am
conscious of a strong desire to work on behalf of the social betterment
of my fellows I may account for this either by attributing it to having
inherited a nature modified by generations of social intercourse or on
the hypothesis that I am an instrument in the hands of a superhuman
personality But in either case the qualities manifested remain the
same Love and hatred fear and courage honesty and roguery with all
other human qualities may be expressed in terms of religion or they
may be expressed in nonreligious terms It is the cause to which they
are attributed or the object to which they are directed that marks off
the religious from the nonreligious person
The second point is that the whole issue arises on a conflict of
interpretations If I question the reality of the visions or states of
illumination experienced by Santa Teresa I am not questioning that so
far as the saint herself was concerned these states of exaltation were
real All mental stateswhether arising under normal or abnormal
conditionsare quite real to those who experience them The visions of
the hashisheater are real while they last so are those of the victim
of delirium tremens All I question is their genuineness as
corresponding to an objective reality Over the mind of the subject
these visions may exercise an absolute sway As to their occurrence he
or she is the final and absolute authority There can be no question
here But when we proceed from the occurrence of these visions to the
question of their causation then we are on entirely different ground
Here it is not a question of their genuineness or of their power but
a question of how we are to interpret them The honesty and
singlemindedness of these inspired characters may be admitted but
honesty or singlemindedness is no guarantee of accuracy We do not need
to ask whether the peasant girl of Lourdes experienced a vision of the
Madonna but we do need to ask whether there was anything in her mental
history social surroundings or nervous state that would account for
the vision All the facts of the religious life may be admitted the
sole question at issue is whether an adequate interpretation of at least
some of them may not be found in terms of a purely scientific
psychology
Taking then the religious idea as already existing the following
pages will be devoted to an examination of the extent to which this idea
has been associated with forces and conditions that were plainly
pathological In very many individual cases it will not be difficult to
trace a vivid sense of the supernatural to the presence of abnormal
nervous states sometimes deliberately induced at other times arising
of themselves And it is a matter of mere historical observation that
such individual cases have operated most powerfully to strengthen the
belief in the supernatural with others The example of Lourdes is a case
in point All Protestants will agree that the peasant girls vision was
a sheer hallucination And yet there can be no question that this vision
has served to strengthen the faith of many thousands of others in the
nearness of the supernatural And it needs but little effort of the
imagination to realise how powerful such examples must have been in ages
when medical science was in its infancy and the more subtle operations
of the nervous system completely unknown
This question I repeat is distinct from the much larger and wider
enquiry of the origin of religion A fairly lengthy experience of the
capacity of the general mind for missing the real point at issue
prevents my being too sanguine as to the efficiency of the most explicit
avowal of ones purpose but the duty of taking precautions nevertheless
remains And in elaborating an unfamiliar view of the nature of much of
the worlds socalled religious phenomena the possibility of
misconception is multiplied enormously Still a writer must do what he
can to guard against misunderstanding and in the most emphatic manner
it must be said that it is not my purpose to prove nor is it my belief
that religion springs from perverted sexuality nor that the study of
religion is no more than an exercise in pathology Nothing is further
from the writers mind than so essentially preposterous a claim Neither
sexuality no matter how powerful nor disease no matter how
pronounced can account for the religious idea That has an entirely
separate and independent origin This should be plain to anyone who has
but a merely casual acquaintance with the history of religion It is
however a very different thing to enquire as to the part played in the
history of religion by morbid nervous states or perverted sexual
feeling That is an enquiry both legitimate and desirable and it is one
that promises to shed light on aspects of the subject otherwise very
obscure And certainly if socalled religious feelings do not admit of
explanation in terms of a scientific psychology nothing remains but to
recognise religion as something quite apart from normal life to hand
it over to the custody of wordspinning Mystics and so surrender all
possibility of a rational understanding of either its nature or its
history
In saying what I have concerning the probability of misconception I
have had specially in mind the attack made by the late Professor William
James on what he called the medical materialists In that remarkable
piece of religious yellowjournalism The Varieties of Religious
Experience Professor James says of those who take up the position that
a great deal of what has been accepted by the world as religious
inspiration or exaltation can be accounted for as the products of
disordered nervous states or perverted sexual feeling We are surely
all familiar in a general way with this method of discrediting states of
mind for which we have an antipathy We all use it in some degree in
criticising persons whose states of mind we regard as overstrained But
when other people criticise our own exalted soulflights by calling them
nothing but expressions of our organic disposition we feel outraged
and hurt for we know that whatever be our organisms peculiarities
our mental states have their substantive value as revelations of the
living truth and we wish that all this medical materialism could be
made to hold its tongue Again Few conceptions are less instructive
than this reinterpretation of religion as perverted sexuality It is
true that in the vast collection of religious phenomena some are
undisguisedly amatoryeg sex deities and obscene rites in
polytheism and ecstatic feelings of union with the Saviour in a few
Christian Mystics But then why not equally call religion an aberration
of the digestive functions and prove ones point by the worship of
Bacchus and Ceres or by the ecstatic feelings of some other saints
about the Eucharist Or seeing that the Bible is full of the language
of respiratory oppression one might almost as well interpret religion
as a perversion of the respiratory function And if it is pointed out
that active interest in religion synchronises with adolescence the
retort again is easy The interest in mechanics physics chemistry
logic philosophy and sociology which springs up during adolescent
years along with that in poetry and religion is also a perversion of
the sexual instinct1
Excellent fooling this but little else I do not know that anyone has
ever claimed that religion took its origin in sexual feeling or that
this would alone provide an explanation of historical religion All that
anyone has ever urged is that a deal of socalled religious feeling
past and present can be shown to be due to unsatisfied or perverted
sexual feelingwhich is a very different statement and one of which
the truth may be demonstrated from Professor Jamess own pages But
between saying that certain feelings are wrongly interpreted in terms of
an already existing idea and saying that the idea itself is nothing but
these same feelings transformed there is an obvious and important
difference In every case the religious idea is taken for granted Its
origin is a quite different subject of enquiry But once the idea is in
existence there is always the probability of evidence for its truth
being found in the wrong direction The analogy of the digestive and
respiratory organs is clever but futile The belief that much which
has passed for religious feeling is perverted sexuality is not based
merely upon the language employed The language is only symptomatic The
terminology of respiration and digestion when used in connection with
religion is frankly and palpably symbolic That of sexual love is as
often frankly literal and can be correlated with the actual state of
the person using it Digestion and respiration must go on in any case
but it is precisely the point at issue whether with a different sexual
life these socalled religious ecstatic states would have been
experienced When we find religious characters of strongly marked
amorous dispositions but leading an ascetic life using toward the
object of their adoration terms usually associated with strong sexual
feeling it does not seem extravagant to find here a little more than
what may be covered by mere symbolism Would the medieval monk have been
tempted by Satan in the form of beautiful women had he been happily
married Would Santa Teresa or Catherine of Sienna have used the
language they did use to express their relations to Jesus had they been
wives and mothers Such questions admit of one answer which is in its
way decisive Professor James admits that modern psychology holds as a
general postulate there is not a single one of our states of mind high
or low healthy or morbid that has not some organic process as its
condition2 The medical materialist can ask for no more than this
But this being granted on what ground are we to be forbidden finding in
these same organic processes the condition of the visions and ecstatic
states with which The Varieties of Religious Experience is so largely
concerned
Again it may be granted that adolescence brings with it an awakening of
the whole mental life not of religion alone But the analogy goes no
further and in any case it begs the question The full significance
of the connection will be seen when we come to deal with initiation in
primitive times and conversion in the modern period At present it
suffices to point out that the interest in art in science in
literature in sociology are ends in themselves and one need go no
further than the developing mental life for an explanation But the
essential question here is whether this growing life can or cannot find
complete satisfaction quite apart from religion A developing interest
in the larger social life is common to all and to some extent this is
secured by the pressure of forces that are simply inescapable On the
other hand an interest in religion only exists with some and then it
