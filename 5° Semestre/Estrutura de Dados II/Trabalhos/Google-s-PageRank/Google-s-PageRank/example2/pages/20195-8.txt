In issuing these volumes of a series of Handbooks on the Artistic
Crafts it will be well to state what are our general aims
In the first place we wish to provide trustworthy textbooks of
workshop practice from the points of view of experts who have
critically examined the methods current in the shops and putting aside
vain survivals are prepared to say what is good workmanship and to set
up a standard of quality in the crafts which are more especially
associated with design Secondly in doing this we hope to treat design
itself as an essential part of good workmanship During the last century
most of the arts save painting and sculpture of an academic kind were
little considered and there was a tendency to look on design as a
mere matter of appearance Such ornamentation as there was was
usually obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing provided by
an artist who often knew little of the technical processes involved in
production With the critical attention given to the crafts by Ruskin
and Morris it came to be seen that it was impossible to detach design
from craft in this way and that in the widest sense true design is an
inseparable element of good quality involving as it does the selection
of good and suitable material contrivance for special purpose expert
workmanship proper finish and so on far more than mere ornament and
indeed that ornamentation itself was rather an exuberance of fine
workmanship than a matter of merely abstract lines Workmanship when
separated by too wide a gulf from fresh thoughtthat is from
designinevitably decays and on the other hand ornamentation
divorced from workmanship is necessarily unreal and quickly falls
into affectation Proper ornamentation may be defined as a language
addressed to the eye it is pleasant thought expressed in the speech of
the tool
In the third place we would have this series put artistic craftsmanship
before people as furnishing reasonable occupations for those who would
gain a livelihood Although within the bounds of academic art the
competition of its kind is so acute that only a very few per cent can
fairly hope to succeed as painters and sculptors yet as artistic
craftsmen there is every probability that nearly every one who would
pass through a sufficient period of apprenticeship to workmanship and
design would reach a measure of success
In the blending of handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to
deal with happy careers may be found as far removed from the dreary
routine of hack labour as from the terrible uncertainty of academic art
It is desirable in every way that men of good education should be
brought back into the productive crafts there are more than enough of
us in the city and it is probable that more consideration will be
given in this century than in the last to Design and Workmanship
There are two common ways of studying old and foreign artsthe way of
the connoisseur and the way of the craftsman The collector may value
such arts for their strangeness and scarcity while the artist finds in
them stimulus in his own work and hints for new developments
The following account of colourprinting from woodblocks is based on a
study of the methods which were lately only practised in Japan but
which at an earlier time were to some degree in use in Europe also The
main principles of the art indeed were well known in the West long
before colour prints were produced in Japan and there is some reason to
suppose that the Japanese may have founded their methods in imitating
the prints taken from Europe by missionaries Major Strange says The
European art of chiaroscuro engraving is in all essentials identical
with that of Japanese colourprinting It seems therefore not vain
to point out that the accidental sight of one of the Italian
colourprints may have suggested the process to the Japanese The
Italians aimed more at expressing relief and the Japanese at flat
colour arrangements the former used oily colours and the latter fair
distemper tints these are the chief differences Both in the West and
the East the design was cut on the plank surface of the wood with a
knife not across the grain with a graver as is done in most modern
wood engraving although large plank woodcuts were produced by Walter
Crane and Herkomer about thirty years ago as posters
The old woodcuts of the fifteenth century were produced as pictures as
well as for the illustration of books frequently they were of
considerable size Often too they were coloured by stencil plates or
freely by hand
At the same time the printing in colour of letters and other simple
devices in books from woodblocks was done and a book printed at St
Albans in 1486 has many coats of arms printed in this way some of the
shields having two or three different colours1
About the year 1500 a method of printing woodcuts in several flat tones
was invented in Germany and practised by Lucas Cranach and others A
fine print of Adam and Eve by Hans Baldung in the Victoria and Albert
Museum has besides the bold black drawing an overtint printed in
warm brown out of which sharp high lights are cut the print is thus in
three tones
1 See R M Burch Colour Printing 1900
Ugo da Carpo c 14801530 working in Venice introduced this new
type of tone woodcut into Italy indeed he claimed to be the inventor
of the method This was called chiaroscuro a name still given to
it and was in fact a simple form of our modern chromo printing His
woodcuts are in a simple vigorous style one of them after Raphaels
Death of Ananias printed in brown has a depth and brilliancy which
may remind us of the mezzotints of Turners Liber Studiorum This is
proudly signed Per Ugo da Carpo and some copies are said to be dated
1518
Andrea Andreani c 15601623 a better known but not a better
artist produced a great number of these tone woodcuts Several prints
after Mantegnas Triumphs of Caesar have a special charm from the
beauty of the originals they are printed in three tints of grey besides
the drawing the palest of these tints covers the surface except for
high lights cut out of it A fine print of a Holy Family about 1518
inches has a middle tone of fair blue and a shadow tint of full rich
green Copies of two immense woodcuts at the Victoria and Albert Museum
of Biblical subjects seem to have been seems to cramp the hand and
injure the eyes of all but the most gifted draughtsmen It is desirable
to cultivate the ability to seize and record the mapform of any
object rapidly and correctly Some practice in elementary
colourprinting would certainly be of general usefulness and simpler
exercises may be contrived by cutting out with scissors and laying down
shapes in black or coloured papers unaided by any pattern
Finally the hope may be expressed that the beautiful art of
woodcutting as developed in Western Europe and brought to such
perfection only a generation ago is only temporarily in abeyance and
that it too may have another day

AUTHORS NOTE
This little book gives an account of one of the primitive crafts in the
practice of which only the simplest tools and materials are used Their
method of use may serve as a means of expression for artistcraftsmen
or may be studied in preparation for or as a guide towards more
elaborate work in printing of which the main principles may be seen
most clearly in their application in the primitive craft
In these days the need for reference to primitive handicrafts has not
ceased with the advent of the machine The best achievements of
handwork will always be the standards for reference and on their study
must machine craft be based The machine can only increase the power
and scale of the crafts that have already been perfected by handwork
Their principles and the art of their design do not alter under the
machine If the machine disregards these its work becomes base And it
is under the simple conditions of a handicraft that the principles of an
art can be most clearly experienced
The best of all the wonderful and excellent work that is produced today
by machinery is that which bears evidence in itself of its derivation
from arts under the pure conditions of classic craftsmanship and shows
the influence of their study
The series of which this book is a part stands for the principles and
the spirit of the classic examples To be associated with those
fellowcraftsmen who have been privileged to work for the Series is
itself an honour of high estimation in the mind of the present writer
If the book contributes even a little toward the usefulness of the
series the experiments which are recorded here will have been well
worth while
To my friend Mr J D Batten is due all the credit of the initial work
He began the search for a pure style of colourprinting and most
generously supported and encouraged my own experiments in the Japanese
method
To my old colleague Mr A W Seaby I would also express my indebtedness
for his kind help and advice

WOODBLOCK PRINTING
BY THE
JAPANESE METHOD
CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY
Introduction and Description of the Origins of Woodblock Printing
its uses for personal artistic expression for reproduction of
decorative designs and as a fundamental training for students of
printed decoration
The few woodblock prints shown from time to time by the Society of
Graver Printers in Colour and the occasional appearance of a woodblock
print in the Graver Section of the International Societys Exhibitions
or in those of the Society of Arts and Crafts are the outcome of the
experiments of a small group of English artists in making prints by the
Japanese method or by methods based on the Japanese practice
My interest was first drawn in 1897 to experiments that were being made
by Mr J D Batten who for two years previously had attempted and
partially succeeded in making a print from wood and metal blocks with
colour mixed with glycerine and dextrine the glycerine being afterwards
removed by washing the prints in alcohol As the Japanese method seemed
to promise greater advantages and simplicity we began experiments
together using as our textbook the pamphlet by T Tokuno published by
the Smithsonian Institution Washington and the dextrine and glycerine
method was soon abandoned The edition of prints however of Eve and
the Serpent designed by J D Batten printed by myself and published at
that time was produced partly by the earlier method and partly in the
simpler Japanese way
Familiar as everyone is with Japanese prints it is not generally known
that they are produced by means of an extremely simple craft No
machinery is required but only a few tools for cutting the designs on
the surface of the planks of cherry wood from which the impressions are
taken No press is used but a round flat pad which is rubbed on the
back of the print as it lies on the blocks The colours are mixed with
water and paste made from rice flour The details of the craft and
photographs of the tools were given in full in the Smithsonian
Institution pamphlet already mentioned
It is slow and unsatisfactory work however learning manipulation from
a book and several technical difficulties that seemed insurmountable
were made clear by the chance discovery in London of a Japanese
printseller who although not a printer was sufficiently familiar with
the work to give some invaluable hints and demonstrations
Further encouragement was given to the work by the institution a little
later of a class in woodcuts in colour under my charge at the LCC
Central School of Arts and Crafts which for several years became the
chief centre of the movement
Such are the bare historical facts of the development in our country of
this craft imported from the Far East
On a merely superficial acquaintance the Japanese craft of
blockprinting may appear to be no more than a primitive though delicate
form of colour reproduction which modern mechanical methods have long
superseded even in the land of its invention and that to study so
limited a mode of expression would be hardly of any practical value to
an artist Moreover the craft is under the disadvantage that all the
stages of the work from making the first design to taking the final
impressions must be done by the artist himselfwork which includes the
delicate cutting of line and planning of colour blocks and the
preparation of colour and paper In Japan there were trained craftsmen
expert in each of these branches of the craft and each carried out
his part under the supervision of the artist No part but the design was
done by him So that the very character of the work has an essential
difference Under our present conditions the artist must undertake the
whole craft with all its detail
Illustration Plate IIKeyblock of the print shown on the
frontispiece
The portion of wood lying outside the points of the mass of foliage is
left standing to support the paper but is not inked in printing
To face page 5
Simple as the process is there is from first to last a long labour
involved in planning cutting and printing before a satisfactory batch
of prints is produced After several attempts in delegating printing to
welltrained pupils I have found it impossible to obtain the best
results by that means but the cutting of the colourblocks and the
clearing of the keyblock after the first cutting of the line may well
be done by assistant craftsmen
A larger demand for the prints might bring about a commercial
development of the work and the consequent employment of trained
craftsmen or craftswomen but the result would be a different one from
that which has been obtained by the artists who are willing to
undertake the whole production of their work
The actual value of woodblock prints for use as decoration is a matter
of personal taste and experience
In my own opinion there is an element that always remains foreign in the
prints of the Japanese masters yet I know of no other kind of art that
has the same telling value on a wall or the same decorative charm in
modern domestic rooms as the woodblock print A single print well
placed in a room of quiet colour will enrich and dominate a whole wall
The modern vogue still favours more expensive although less decorative
forms of art or works of reproduction without colour yet here is an
art available to all who care for expressive design and colour and
within the means of the large public to whom the cost of pictures is
prohibitive In its possibility as a decorative means of expression well
suited to our modern needs and uses and in the particular charm that
colour has when printed from wood on a paper that is beautiful already
by its own quality there is no doubt of the scope and opportunity
offered by this art
But as with new wine and old bottles a new condition of simplicity in
furniture and of pure colour in decoration must first be established A
woodblock print will not tell well amid a wilderness of bricabrac or
on a gaudy wallpaper
From another and quite different point of view the art of blockcutting
and colourprinting has however a special and important value To any
student of pictorial art especially to any who may wish to design for
modern printed decoration no work gives such instruction in economy of
design in the resources of line and its expressive development and in
the use and behaviour of colour This has been the expressed opinion of
many who have undertaken a course of woodblock printing for this object
alone
The same opinion is emphatically stated by Professor Emil Orlik whose
prints are well known in modern exhibitions On the occasion of a visit
to the Kunstgewerbeschule of Berlin I found him conducting a class for
designers for printed decoration in which the Japanese craft of
blockprinting was made the basis of their training He held to the view
that the primitive craft teaches the students the very economy and
simplicity upon which the successful use of the great modern resources
of colourprinting depend yet which cannot be learnt except by recourse
to simpler conditions and more narrow limitations before dealing with
the greater scope of the machine
My own experience also convinces me that whatever may be the ultimate
value of the Eastern craft to our artists as a mode of personal
expression there is no doubt of its effect and usefulness in training
students to design with economy and simplicity for modern printing
processes
CHAPTER II
General Description of the Operation of Printing from a Set of
Blocks
The early stages of any craft are more interesting when we are familiar
with the final result For this reason it is often an advantage to begin
at the end
To see a few impressions taken from a set of blocks in colour printing
or to print them oneself gives the best possible idea of the quality
and essential character of printmaking So also in describing the work
it will perhaps tend to make the various stages clearer if the final act
of printing is first explained
The most striking characteristic of this craft is the primitive
simplicity of the act of printing No press is required and no
machinery
A block is laid flat on the table with its cut surface uppermost and is
kept steady by a small wad of damp paper placed under each corner A
pile of paper slightly damped ready for printing lies within reach just
beyond the woodblock so that the printer may easily lift the paper
sheet by sheet on to the block as it is required
It is the practice in Japan to work squatting on the floor with the
blocks and tools also on the floor in front of the craftsman Our own
habit of working at a table is less simple but has some advantages One
practice or habit of the Japanese is however to be followed with
particular care No description can give quite fully the sense of
extreme orderliness and careful deliberation of their work Everything
is placed where it will be most convenient for use and this orderliness
is preserved throughout the days work Their shapely tools and vessels
are handled with a deftness that shames our clumsy ways and everything
that they use is kept quite clean This skilful orderliness is essential
to fine craftmanship and is a sign of mastery
The arrangement of tools and vessels on a worktable may be as the
accompanying plan shows
Illustration FIG 1Plan of worktable

C Second board lifted from B

F Saucer containing paste of riceflour
G Baren or printing pad lying on a sheet of paper
slightly oiled with sweet oil and tacked to
the table
H Deep bowl of water and brush for moistening
the damping sheets
I Saucer of water for use in printing
J Sponge
When printing on a table arranged in this way the board lying on the
sheets of damped paper at B is first lifted off and placed at C to
receive the sheets as they are done If the block A is quite dry it is
thoroughly moistened with a damp sponge and wiped The colour from a
saucer E is then brushed over the printing surface thinly and a trace
of paste taken from F is also brushed into the colour This is best
done after the colour is roughly spread on the block The brush is laid
down in its place D and the top sheet of paper from the pile is
immediately lifted to its register marks notches to keep the paper in
its place on the block The manner of holding the paper is shown on
page 70 This must be done deftly and it is important to waste no time
as the colour would soon dry on the exposed block and print badly
Pressure is then applied to the back of the paper as it lies on the wet
block This is done by a round pad called the baren by the Japanese
It is made of a coil of cord covered by bamboo sheath as shown later
on page 62 The pad is rubbed by hand with considerable pressure moving
transversely forwards and backwards across the block working from the
left to the right Once all over the block should be enough The paper
is then lifted off and laid face upwards on the board at C The block is
then recharged with colour for another impression and the whole
operation repeated as many times as there are sheets to be printed
Illustration Plate III The Baren or printing pad
The pad is actually 5 inches in diameter
To face page 12
When this is done all the sheets will have received a single impression
which may be either a patch of colour or an impression in line of part
of the design of the print The block A is then removed cleaned and
put away and the block for the second impression put in its place
It is usual to print the line or keyblock of a design first as one is
then able to detect faulty registering or imperfect fitting of the
blocks and to correct them at once But there are cases in which a
gradated tone such as a sky may need to be printed before the line
block
The complete design of a print may require several blocks for colour as
well as the key block which prints the line The impressions from all
these blocks may be printed one after another without waiting for the
colour on the paper to dry
As soon as the batch of damped sheets has been passed over the first
block the sheets are replaced at B between boards and if necessary
damped again by means of damping sheets as described later in Chapter
V ready for the next impression which may be proceeded with at once
without fear of the colour running It is a remarkable fact that patches
of wet colour which touch one another do not run if properly printed
For the second printing fresh colour is prepared and clean paste and
the printing proceeds as already described care being taken to watch
the proper registering or fitting of each impression to its place in the
design
There are many niceties and details to be observed in the printing of
both line and colour blocks These are given in special chapters
following This description of the main action of printing will be of
use in giving a general idea of the final operation before the details
of the preliminary stages are described
CHAPTER III
Description of the Materials and Tools required for Blockcutting
The wood most commonly used by the Japanese for their printingblocks is
a cherry wood very similar to that grown in England The Canadian cherry
wood which is more easily obtained than English cherry is of too open
a grain to be of use The more slowly grown English wood has a closer
grain and is the best for all the purposes of block cutting and
