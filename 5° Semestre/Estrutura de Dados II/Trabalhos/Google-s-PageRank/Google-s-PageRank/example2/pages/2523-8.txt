PREFACE
This volume of memoirs has a double characterhistorical and intimate
The life of a period the XIX Century is bound up in the life of a man
VICTOR HUGO As we follow the events set forth we get the impression
they made upon the mind of the extraordinary man who recounts them and
of all the personages he brings before us he himself is assuredly not
the least interesting In portraits from the brushes of Rembrandts there
are always two portraits that of the model and that of the painter
This is not a diary of events arranged in chronological order nor is it
a continuous autobiography It is less and it is more or rather it is
better than these It is a sort of haphazard chronique in which only
striking incidents and occurrences are brought out and lengthy and
wearisome details are avoided VICTOR HUGOS long and chequered life was
filled with experiences of the most diverse characterliterature and
politics the court and the street parliament and the theatre labour
struggles disappointments exile and triumphs Hence we get a series of
pictures of infinite variety
Let us pass the gallery rapidly in review
It opens in 1825 at Rheims during the coronation of CHARLES X with
an amusing causerie on the manners and customs of the Restoration
The splendour of this coronation ceremony was singularly spoiled by the
pitiable taste of those who had charge of it These worthies took upon
themselves to mutilate the sculpture work on the marvellous facade
and to embellish the austere cathedral with Gothic decorations of
cardboard The century like the author was young and in some things
both were incredibly ignorant the masterpieces of literature were then
unknown to the most learned litterateurs CHARLES NODIER had never
read the Romancero and VICTOR HUGO knew little or nothing about
Shakespeare
At the outset the poet dominates in VICTOR HUGO he belongs wholly to
his creative imagination and to his literary work It is the theatre
it is his Cid and Hernani with its stormy performances it is the
group of his actors Mlle MARS Mlle GEORGES FREDERICK LEMAITRE the
French KEAN with more genius it is the Academy with its different
kind of coteries
About this time VICTOR HUGO questions anxiously and not in vain a
passerby who witnessed the execution of LOUIS XVI and an officer who
escorted Napoleon to Paris on his return from the Island of Elba
Next under the title Visions of the Real come some sketches in the
masters best style of things seen in the minds eye as Hamlet says
Among them The Hovel will attract attention This sketch resembles
a page from EDGAR POE although it was written long before POEs works
were introduced into France
With Love in Prison VICTOR HUGO deals with social questions in which
he was more interested than in political questions And yet in entering
the Chamber of Peers he enters public life His sphere is enlarged he
becomes one of the familiars of the Tuileries LOUIS PHILIPPE verbose
and full of recollections that he is fond of imparting to others seeks
the company and appreciation of this listener of note and makes all
sorts of confidences to him The King with his very haughty bonhomie and
his somewhat infatuated wisdom the grave and sweet DUCHESS DORLEANS
the boisterous and amiable princesthe whole commonplace and homelike
courtare depicted with kindliness but sincerity
The horizon however grows dark and from 1846 the new peer of France
notes the gradual tottering of the edifice of royalty The revolution of
1848 bursts out Nothing could be more thrilling than the account hour
by hour of the events of the three days of February VICTOR HUGO is not
merely a spectator of this great drama he is an actor in it He is in
the streets he makes speeches to the people he seeks to restrain them
he believes with too good reason that the Republic is premature and
in the Place de la Bastille before the evolutionary Faubourg Saint
Antoine he dares to proclaim the Regency
Four months later distress provokes the formidable insurrection of June
which is fatal to the Republic
The year 1848 is the stormy year The atmosphere is fiery men are
violent events are tragical Battles in the streets are followed by
fierce debates in the Assembly VICTOR HUGO takes part in the melee We
witness the scenes with him he points out the chief actors to us His
Sketches made in the National Assembly are sketched from life in the
fullest acceptation of the term Twenty lines suffice ODILON BARROT and
CHANGARNIER PRUDHON and BLANQUI LAMARTINE and Monsieur THIERS come
go speakveritable living figures
The most curious of the figures is LOUIS BONAPARTE when he arrived in
Paris and when he assumed the Presidency of the Republic He is gauche
affected somewhat ridiculous distrusted by the Republicans and
scoffed at by the Royalists Nothing could be more suggestive or more
piquant than the inauguration dinner at the Elysee at which VICTOR HUGO
was one of the guests and the first and courteous relations between
the author of Napoleon the Little and the future Emperor who was to
inflict twenty years of exile upon him
But now we come to the year which VICTOR HUGO has designated The
Terrible Year the war and the siege of Paris This part of the volume
is made up of extracts from notebooks private and personal notes
dotted down from day to day Which is to say that they do not constitute
an account of the oftrelated episodes of the siege but tell something
new the little side of great events the little incidents of everyday
life the number of shells fired into the city and what they cost the
degrees of cold the price of provisions what is being said sung and
eaten and at the same time give the psychology of the great city its
illusions revolts wrath anguish and also its gaiety for during
these long months Paris never gave up hope and preserved an heroic
cheerfulness
On the other hand a painful note runs through the diary kept during the
meeting of the Assembly at Bordeaux France is not only vanquished she
is mutilated The conqueror demands a ransom of milliardsit is his
right the right of the strongest but he tears from her two provinces
with their inhabitants devoted to France it is a return towards
barbarism VICTOR HUGO withdraws indignantly from the Assembly which
has agreed to endorse the Treaty of Frankfort And three days after his
resignation he sees CHARLES HUGO his eldest son die a victim to the
privations of the siege He is stricken at once in his love of country
and in his paternal love and one can say that in these painful pages
more than in any of the others the book is history that has been lived

AT RHEIMS 18231838
It was at Rheims that I heard the name of Shakespeare for the first
time It was pronounced by Charles Nodier That was in 1825 during the
coronation of Charles X
No one at that time spoke of Shakespeare quite seriously Voltaires
ridicule of him was law Mme de Stael had adopted Germany the great
land of Kant of Schiller and of Beethoven Ducis was at the height of
his triumph he and Delille were seated side by side in academic glory
which is not unlike theatrical glory Ducis had succeeded in doing
something with Shakespeare he had made him possible he had extracted
some tragedies from him Ducis impressed one as being a man who could
chisel an Apollo out of Moloch It was the time when Iago was called
Pezare Horatio Norceste and Desdemona Hedelmone A charming and very
witty woman the Duchess de Duras used to say Desdemona what an ugly
name Fie Talma Prince of Denmark in a tunic of lilac satin trimmed
with fur used to exclaim Avaunt Dread spectre The poor spectre in
fact was only tolerated behind the scenes If it had ventured to put
in the slightest appearance M Evariste Dumoulin would have given it a
severe talking to Some Genin or other would have hurled at it the first
cobblestone he could lay his hand ona line from Boileau Lesprit
nest point emu de ce quil ne croit pas It was replaced on the stage
by an urn that Talma carried under his arm A spectre is ridiculous
ashes thats the style Are not the ashes of Napoleon still
spoken of Is not the translation of the coffin from St Helena to the
Invalides alluded to as the return of the ashes As to the witches
of Macbeth they were rigorously barred The hallporter of the
TheatreFrancais had his orders They would have been received with
their own brooms
I am mistaken however in saying that I did not know Shakespeare I
knew him as everybody else did not having read him and having treated
him with ridicule My childhood began as everybodys childhood begins
with prejudices Man finds prejudices beside his cradle puts them from
him a little in the course of his career and often alas takes to them
again in his old age
During this journey in 1825 Charles Nodier and I passed our time
recounting to each other the Gothic tales and romances that have taken
root in Rheims Our memories and sometimes our imaginations clubbed
together Each of us furnished his legend Rheims is one of the most
impossible towns in the geography of story Pagan lords have lived
there one of whom gave as a dower to his daughter the strips of land in
Borysthenes called the racecourses of Achilles The Duke de Guyenne
in the fabliaux passes through Rheims on his way to besiege Babylon
Babylon moreover which is very worthy of Rheims is the capital of
the Admiral Gaudissius It is at Rheims that the deputation sent by
the Locri Ozolae to Apollonius of Tyana high priest of Bellona
disembarks While discussing this disembarkation we argued concerning
the Locri Ozolae These people according to Nodier were called the
Fetidae because they were half monkeys according to myself because
they inhabited the marshes of Phocis We reconstructed on the spot the
tradition of St Remigius and his adventures with the fairy Mazelane
The Champagne country is rich in tales Nearly all the old Gaulish
fables had their origin in this province Rheims is the land of
chimeras It is perhaps for this reason that kings were crowned there
Legends are so natural to this place are in such good soil that they
immediately began to germinate upon the coronation of Charles X
itself The Duke of Northumberland the representative of England at
the coronation ceremonies was reputed fabulously wealthy Wealthy and
English how could he be otherwise than a la mode The English at
that period were very popular in French society although not among the
people They were liked in certain salons because of Waterloo which
was still fairly recent and to Anglicize the French language was
a recommendation in ultrafashionable society Lord Northumberland
therefore long before his arrival was popular and legendary in
Rheims A coronation was a godsend to Rheims A flood of opulent people
inundated the city It was the Nile that was passing Landlords rubbed
their hands with glee
There was in Rheims in those days and there probably is today at the
corner of a street giving on to the square a rather large house with
a carriageentrance and a balcony built of stone in the royal style
of Louis XIV and facing the cathedral About this house and Lord
Northumberland the following was related
In January 1825 the balcony of the house bore the notice House
for Sale All at once the Moniteur announced that the coronation of
Charles X would take place at Rheims in the spring There was great
rejoicing in the city Notices of rooms to let were immediately hung
out everywhere The meanest room was to bring in at least sixty francs
a day One morning a man of irreproachable appearance dressed in black
with a white cravat an Englishman who spoke broken French presented
himself at the house in the square He saw the proprietor who eyed him
attentively
You wish to sell your house queried the Englishman
How much
Ten thousand francs
But I dont want to buy it
What do you want then
Only to hire it
Thats different For a year
For six months
No I want to hire it for three days
How much will you charge
Thirty thousand francs
The gentleman was Lord Northumberlands steward who was looking for a
lodging for his master for the coronation ceremonies The proprietor
had smelled the Englishman and guessed the steward The house was
satisfactory and the proprietor held out for his price the Englishman
being only a Norman gave way to the Champenois the duke paid the
30000 francs and spent three days in the house at the rate of 400
francs an hour
Nodier and I were two explorers When we travelled together as we
occasionally did we went on voyages of discovery he in search of rare
books I in search of ruins He would go into ecstasies over a Cymbalum
Mound with margins and I over a defaced portal We had given each
other a devil He said to me You are possessed of the demon Ogive
And you I answered of the demon Elzevir
At Soissons while I was exploring Saint JeandesVignes he had
discovered in a suburb a ragpicker The ragpickers basket is the
hyphen between rags and paper and the ragpicker is the hyphen between
the beggar and the philosopher Nodier who gave to the poor and
sometimes to philosophers had entered the ragpickers abode The
ragpicker turned out to be a book dealer Among the books Nodier noticed
a rather thick volume of six or eight hundred pages printed in Spanish
two columns to a page badly damaged by worms and the binding missing
from the back The ragpicker asked what he wanted for it replied
trembling lest the price should be refused Five francs which Nodier
paid also trembling but with joy This book was the Romancero
complete There are only three complete copies of this edition now in
existence One of these a few years ago sold for 7500 francs Moreover
worms are vying with each other in eating up these three remaining
copies The peoples feeders of princes have something else to do than
spend their money to preserve for new editions the legacies of human
intellect and the Romancero being merely an Iliad has not been
reprinted
During the three days of the coronation there were great crowds in the
streets of Rheims at the Archbishops palace and on the promenades
along the Vesdre eager to catch a glimpse of Charles X I said to
Charles Nodier Let us go and see his majesty the cathedral
Rheims is a proverb in Gothic Christian art One speaks of the nave
of Amiens the bell towers of Chartres the facade of Rheims A month
before the coronation of Charles X a swarm of masons perched on ladders
and clinging to knotted ropes spent a week smashing with hammers every
bit of jutting sculpture on the facade for fear a stone might become
detached from one of these reliefs and fall on the Kings head The
debris littered the pavement and was swept away For a long time I had
in my possession a head of Christ that fell in this way It was stolen
from me in 1851 This head was unfortunate broken by a king it was
lost by an exile
Nodier was an admirable antiquary and we explored the cathedral from
top to bottom encumbered though it was with scaffolding painted
scenery and stage side lights The nave being only of stone they had
hidden it by an edifice of cardboard doubtless because the latter bore
a greater resemblance to the monarchy of that period For the coronation
of the King of France they had transformed a church into a theatres and
it has since been related with perfect accuracy that on arriving at
the entrance I asked of the bodyguard on duty Where is my box
This cathedral of Rheims is beautiful above all cathedrals On the
facade are kings on the absis people being put to the torture by
executioners Coronation of kings with an accompaniment of victims
The facade is one of the most magnificent symphonies ever sung by that
music architecture One dreams for a long time before this oratorio
Looking up from the square you see at a giddy height at the base of the
two towers a row of gigantic statues representing kings of France In
their hands they hold the sceptre the sword the hand of justice and
the globe and on their heads are antique open crowns with bulging gems
It is superb and grim You push open the bellringers door climb the
winding staircase the screw of St Giles to the towers to the high
regions of prayer you look down and the statues are below you The
row of kings is plunging into the abysm You hear the whispering of the
enormous bells which vibrate at the kiss of vague zephyrs from the sky
One day I gazed down from the top of the tower through an embrasure The
entire facade sheered straight below me I perceived in the depth on
top of a long stone support that extended down the wall directly beneath
me to the escarpment so that its form was lost a sort of round basin
Rainwater had collected there and formed a narrow mirror at the bottom
there were also a tuft of grass with flowers in it and a swallows
nest Thus in a space only two feet in diameter were a lake a garden
and a habitationa birds paradise As I gazed the swallow was giving
water to her brood Round the upper edge of the basin were what looked
like crenelles and between these the swallow had built her nest
I examined these crenelles They had the form of fleursdelys The
support was a statue This happy little world was the stone crown of an
old king And if God were asked Of what use was this Lothario
this Philip this Charles this Louis this emperor this king
God peradventure would reply He had this statue made and lodged a
swallow
The coronation occurred This is not the place to describe it Besides
my recollections of the ceremony of May 27 1825 have been recounted
elsewhere by another more ably than I could set them forth
Suffice it to say that it was a radiant day God seemed to have given
his assent to the fete The long clear windowsfor there are no more
stainedglass windows at Rheimslet in bright daylight all the light
of May was in the church The Archbishop was covered with gilding
and the altar with rays Marshal de Lauriston Minister of the Kings
Household rejoiced at the sunshine He came and went as busy as
could be and conversed in low tones with Lecointe and Hittorf the
architects The fine morning afforded the occasion to say the sun of
the coronation as one used to say the sun of Austerlitz And in the
resplendent light a profusion of lamps and tapers found means to beam
At one moment Charles X attired in a cherrycoloured simar striped
with gold lay at full length at the Archbishops feet The peers of
France on the right embroidered with gold beplumed in the Henri IV
style and wearing long mantles of velvet and ermine and the Deputies
on the left in dresscoats of blue cloth with silver fleursdelys on
the collars looked on
About all the forms of chance were represented there the Papal
benediction by the cardinals some of whom had witnessed the coronation
of Napoleon victory by the marshals heredity by the Duke dAngouleme
dauphin happiness by M de Talleyrand lame but able to get about the
rising and falling of stocks by M de Villele joy by the birds that
were released and flew away and the knaves in a pack of playingcards
by the four heralds
A vast carpet embroidered with fleursdelys made expressly for the
occasion and called the coronation carpet covered the old flagstones
from one end of the cathedral to the other and concealed the tombstones
in the pavement Thick luminous smoke of incense filled the nave The
birds that had been set at liberty flew wildly about in this cloud
The King changed his costume six or seven times The first prince of the
blood Louis Philippe Duke dOrleans aided him The Duke de Bordeaux
who was five years old was in a gallery
The pew in which Nodier and I were seated adjoined those of the
Deputies In the middle of the ceremony just before the King
prostrated himself at the feet of the Archbishop a Deputy for the Doubs
department named M Hemonin turned towards Nodier who was close to
him and with his finger on his lips as a sign that he did not wish to
disturb the Archbishops orisons by speaking slipped something into
my friends hand This something was a book Nodier took it and glanced
over it
What is it I whispered
Nothing very precious he replied An odd volume of Shakespeare
Glasgow edition
One of the tapestries from the treasure of the church hanging exactly
opposite to us represented a not very historical interview between John
Lackland and Philip Augustus Nodier turned over the leaves of the book
for a few minutes then pointed to the tapestry
You see that tapestry
Yes
Do you know what it represents
No
John Lackland
Well what of it
John Lackland is also in this book
The volume which was in sheep binding and worn at the corners was
indeed a copy of King John
M Hemonin turned to Nodier and said I paid six sous for it
In the evening the Duke of Northumberland gave a ball It was a
magnificent fairylike spectacle This Arabian Nights ambassador brought
one of these nights to Rheims Every woman found a diamond in her
bouquet
I could not dance Nodier had not danced since he was sixteen years
of age when a great aunt went into ecstasies over his terpsichorean
efforts and congratulated him in the following terms Tu est charmant
tu danses comme rim chou We did not go to Lord Northumberlands ball
What shall we do tonight said I to Nodier He held up his odd volume
and answered
Let us read this
We read
That is to say Nodier read He knew English without being able
to speak it I believe enough to make it out He read aloud and
translated as he read At intervals while he rested I took the book
bought from the ragpicker of Soissons and read passages from the
Romancero Like Nodier I translated as I read We compared the
English with the Castilian book we confronted the dramatic with the
epic Nodier stood up for Shakespeare whom he could read in English
and I for the Romancero which I could read in Spanish We brought
face to face he the bastard Faulconbridge I the bastard Mudarra And
little by little in contradicting we convinced each other and Nodier
became filled with enthusiasm for the Romancero and I with admiration
for Shakespeare
Listeners arrived One passes the evening as best one can in a
provincial town on a coronation day when one doesnt go to the ball We
formed quite a little club There was an academician M Roger a man of
letters M dEckstein M de Marcellus friend and country neighbour
of my father who poked fun at his royalism and mine good old Marquis
dHerbouville and M Hemonin donor of the book that cost six sous
It isnt worth the money exclaimed M Roger
The conversation developed into a debate Judgment was passed upon King
John M de Marcellus declared that the assassination of Arthur was an
improbable incident It was pointed out to him that it was a matter of
history It was with difficulty that he became reconciled to it For
kings to kill each other was impossible To M de Marcelluss mind the
murdering of kings began on January 21 Regicide was synonymous with
93 To kill a king was an unheardof thing that the populace alone
were capable of doing No king except Louis XVI had ever been violently
put to death He however reluctantly admitted the case of Charles
I In his death also he saw the hand of the populace All the rest was
demagogic lying and calumny
Although as good a royalist as he I ventured to insinuate that the
sixteenth century had existed and that it was the period when the
Jesuits had clearly propounded the question of bleeding the basilic
vein that is to say of cases in which the king ought to be slain
a question which once brought forward met with such success that it
resulted in two kings Henry III and Henry IV being stabbed and a
Jesuit Father Guignard being hanged
Then we passed to the details of the drama situations scenes and
personages Nodier pointed out that Faulconbridge is the same person
spoken of by Mathieu Paris as Falcasius de Trente bastard of Richard
Coeur de Lion Baron dEckstein in support of this reminded his
hearers that according to Hollinshed Faulconbridge or Falcasius
slew the Viscount de Limoges to avenge his father Richard who had
been wounded unto death at the siege of Chaluz and that this castle of
Chaluz being the property of the Viscount de Limoges it was only right
that the Viscount although absent should be made to answer with his
head for the falling of an arrow or a stone from the castle upon the
King M Roger laughed at the cry of Austria Limoges in the play and
at Shakespeares confounding the Viscount de Limoges with the Duke of
Austria M Roger scored the success of the evening and his laughter
settled the matter
The discussion having taken this turn I said nothing further This
revelation of Shakespeare had moved me His grandeur impressed me King
John is not a masterpiece but certain scenes are lofty and powerful
and in the motherhood of Constance there are bursts of genius
The two books open and reversed remained lying upon the table The
company had ceased to read in order to laugh Nodier at length became
silent like myself We were beaten The gathering broke up with a laugh
and our visitors went away Nodier and I remained alone and pensive
thinking of the great works that are unappreciated and amazed that the
intellectual education of the civilized peoples and even our own his
and mine had advanced no further than this
At last Nodier broke the silence I can see his smile now as he said
They know nothing about the Romancero
I replied
And they deride Shakespeare
Thirteen years later chance took me to Rheims again
It was on August 28 1838 It will be seen further on why this date
impressed itself on my memory
I was returning from Vouziers and seeing the two towers of Rheims in
the distance was seized with a desire to visit the cathedral again I
therefore went to Rheims
On arriving in the cathedral square I saw a gun drawn up near the portal
and beside it gunners with lighted fuses in their hands As I had seen
artillery there on May 27 1825 I supposed it was customary to keep a
cannon in the square and paid little attention to it I passed on and
entered the church
A beadle in violet sleeves a sort of priest took me in charge and
conducted me all over the church The stones were dark the statues
dismal the altar mysterious No lamps competed with the sun The
latter threw upon the sepulchral stones in the pavement the long white
silhouettes of the windows which through the melancholy obscurity of
the rest of the church looked like phantoms lying upon these tombs No
one was in the church Not a whisper not a footfall could be heard
This solitude saddened the heart and enraptured the soul There were in
it abandonment neglect oblivion exile and sublimity Gone the whirl
of 1825 The church had resumed its dignity and its calmness Not
a piece of finery not a vestment not anything It was bare and
beautiful The lofty vault no longer supported a canopy Ceremonies of
the palace arc not suited to these severe places a coronation ceremony
is merely tolerated these noble ruins are not made to be courtiers
To rid it of the throne and withdraw the king from the presence of God
increases the majesty of a temple Louis XIV hides Jehovah from sight
Withdraw the priest as well All that eclipsed it having been taken
away you will see the light of day direct Orisons rites bibles
formulas refract and decompose the sacred light A dogma is a dark
chamber Through a religion you see the solar spectre of God but not
God Desuetude and crumbling enhance the grandeur of a temple As
human religion retires from this mysterious and jealous edifice divine
religion enters it Let solitude reign in it and you will feel heaven
there A sanctuary deserted and in ruins like Jumieges like St
Bertin like Villers like Holyrood like Montrose Abbey like the
temple of Paestum like the hypogeum of Thebes becomes almost an
element and possesses the virginal and religious grandeur of a savannah
or of a forest There something of the real Presence is to be found
Such places are truly holy man has meditated and communed with himself
therein What they contained of truth has remained and become greater
The apeupres has no longer any voice Extinct dogmas have not left
their ashes the prayer of the past has left its perfume There is
something of the absolute in prayer and because of this that which
was a synagogue that which was a mosque that which was a pagoda is
venerable A stone on which that great anxiety that is called prayer
has left its impress is never treated with ridicule by the thinker The
trace left by those who have bowed down before the infinite is always
imposing
In strolling about the cathedral I had climbed to the triforium
then under the arched buttresses then to the top of the edifice The
timberwork under the pointed roof is admirable but less remarkable
than the forest of Amiens It is of chestnutwood
These cathedral attics are of grim appearance One could almost lose
ones self in the labyrinths of rafters squares traverse beams
superposed joists traves architraves girders madriers and tangled
lines and curves One might imagine ones self to be in the skeleton
of Babel The place is as bare as a garret and as wild as a cavern
The wind whistles mournfully through it Rats are at home there The
spiders driven from the timber by the odour of chestnut make their
home in the stone of the basement where the church ends and the roof
begins and low down in the obscurity spin their webs in which you catch
your face One respires a mysterious dust and the centuries seem to
mingle with ones breath The dust of churches is not like the dust of
houses it reminds one of the tomb it is composed of ashes
The flooring of these colossal garrets has crevices in it through which
one can look down into the abysm the church below In the corners that
one cannot explore are pools of shadow as it were Birds of prey enter
through one window and go out through the other Lightning is also
familiar with these high mysterious regions Sometimes it ventures too
near and then it causes the conflagration of Rouen of Chartres or of
St Pauls London
My guide the beadle preceded me He looked at the dung on the floor and
tossed his head He knew the bird by its manure and growled between his
teeth
This is a rook this is a hawk this is an owl
You ought to study the human heart said I
