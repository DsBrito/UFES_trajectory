THE ART OF PENMANSHIP
How to Become a Handsome Writer
The subject of the importance of good writing is as broad as its
use Reaching out in every direction and pervading every corner of
civilized society from the humblest up to the highest employments
it is a servant of man second only in importance to that of speech
itself In the world of business its value is seen from the simplest
record or memorandum up to the parchment which conveys a kingdom
Without it the wheels of commerce could not move a single hour At
night it has recorded the transactions of the Bank of England during
the day of London of the whole world
Through the art of writing the deeds of men live after them and
we may surround ourselves with the companionship of philosophers
scientists historians discoverers and poets and their discoveries
and reasonings and imaginings become ours In the amenities of social
life through the medium of the pen heart speaks to heart though
ocean rolls between Thoughts of tenderness and affection live when
we are gone and words and deeds of kindness are not preserved by
monuments alone What fountains of grief or joy have been opened in
the hearts of those who have read the records of the pen The pen
has recorded the rapturous emotions of love reciprocated The pen has
written the message of sadness which has covered lifes pilgrimage
with gloom The pen has traced the record of noble and useful lives
spent in humanitys cause The songs of the poet the beautiful tints
of his imagination the flights of the orator in the realms of fancy
and the facts of history would all perish as the dew of morning
without this noble art of writing
As a means of livelihood there is perhaps no other department of
education which affords such universal and profitable employment as
writing From the mere copyist up to the practical accountant and
onward into that department of penmanship designated as a fine art
the remuneration is always very ample considering the time and effort
required in its acquisition
Teachers editors farmers doctors and all persons should possess a
practical and substantial knowledge of writing and should be ready
with the pen Business men must of course be ready writers and hence
in a treatise on business designed for the education and advancement
of the youth of the country it seems eminently fitting to first make
the way clear to a plain practical handwriting Neatness and accuracy
should characterize the handwriting of every one Botchwork and
bungling are inexcusable as well in writing as in the transaction
of business No person has a right to cause a tinge of shame to their
correspondent by sending a letter addressed in a stupid and awkward
manner nor to consume the time of another in deciphering the
illegible hooks and scrawls of a message Every one should have the
ambition to write respectably as well as to appear respectable on
any occasion
MATERIALS USED IN WRITING
Having a suitable desk or table arranged with reference to light in
order to learn to write it is necessary to be provided with proper
materials Writing materials abundant and so cheap in these times that
no excuse is afforded for using an inferior or worthless quality The
materials consist of Pens Ink and Paper
PENS
Steel pens are considered the best Gold pens have the advantage of
always producing the same quality of writing while steel pens new or
old produce finer or courser lines Notwithstanding this advantage in
favor of the gold pen steel pens adhere to the paper and produce a
better line The pen should be adapted to the hand of the writer Some
persons require a coarse pen and some fine Elastic pens in the hand
of one writer may produce the best results while a less flexible pen
may suit the hand of others best Pens are manufactured of almost an
infinite grade and quality in order to suit the requirements of all
About the only rule that can be given in selecting pens is to write a
few lines or a page with each of the pens on trial and then compare
the writing If it be shaded too heavily select a less flexible pen
if the hair lines are too delicate select a coarser pen
INK
Black ink is always preferable That which is free from sediment and
flows well should be selected Use an inkstand with broad base as
being less liable to upset With persons in learning to write it is
perhaps best to have a quality of ink which is perfectly black when
put on the paper in order that they may see the results of their
labor at once Business men and accountants prefer a fluid ink
however which although not black at first continues to grow black
and becomes a very bright and durable black notwithstanding the
action of light and heat Avoid the use of fancy colored inks
especially the more gaudy such as blue red or green in writing all
documents which you desire to command attention and respect
PAPER
There are almost as many grades of paper to be found in the stationery
stores as there are of pens For practicing penmanship nothing is
more suitable than foolscap which may be easily sewed into bookform
with cover of some different color and thus serves every requirement
The paper should have a medium surface neither rough and coarse or
too fine and glazed Have a few extra sheets beside the writing book
for the purpose of practicing the movement exercises and testing the
pens Be provided at all times with a largesized blotter and when
writing keep this under the hand Do not attempt to write with a
single sheet of paper on a bare table or desk there should be many
sheets of paper underneath in order to make an elastic surface
STUDY WITH PRACTICE
Aimless indifferent or careless practice never made a good writer
and never will In order to succeed in this as in other things there
must be will and determination to succeed and then persevering and
studious effort Study the models until their forms are fixed in the
mind
Illustration Study gives form
No one can execute that which he does not clearly conceive The artist
must first see the picture on the white canvas before he can paint
it and the sculptor must be able to see in the rough and uninviting
stone the outlines of the beautiful image which he is to carve In
writing a clear idea of the formation of the different letters
and their various proportions must become familiar by proper study
examination and analysis Study precedes practice It is of course
not necessary nor even well to undertake the mastery of all the
forms in writing by study until some have been executed It is
best that each form should as it is taken up be first measured and
analyzed and then practiced at once
Illustration Practice gives grace
It is the act which crowns the thought After study careful and
earnest practice can hardly fail to make a good writer of any one
Some persons secure a good style of penmanship with less labor than
others and attain to the elegant and beautiful formation But it
is only fair to presume that no greater diversity of talent exists
in this direction than in the study of other things All do not learn
arithmetic or history with like ease but no one will assert that all
who will may not learn arithmetic or history And so all who will
put forth the proper exertion in study and practice may learn to write
a good business style while many of the number will attain to the
elegant The conditions of practice in writing are Positions of the
Body Position of the Hand an Pen and Movement
Illustration Position of the Body
POSITION of the BODY
Sitting squarely fronting the desk with feet placed firmly on the
floor and both arms on the desk is as a rule the best position for
practice in writing or correspondence The right side may however
be placed to the desk with the right arm only resting thereon and
some persons prefer this position Avoid crossing the feet sitting
on the edge of the chair or assuming any careless attitude The body
should be erect but slightly inclined forward in order that the eye
may follow the pen closely This position will never cause curvature
of the spine The body should never be allowed to settle down into a
cramped and unhealthy position with the face almost on the paper
By thus compressing the lungs and the digestive organs they are soon
injured and if the stomach lose its tone the eyesight is impaired
there is such a close sympathy between these organs of the body The
practice of writing should be and properly is a healthful exercise
and injurious effects result only from improper positions of the body
at variance with good writing as well as good health
When wearied by sitting and the effort at writing lay aside paper and
pen arise from the chair and take exercise and rest by walking about
the room or in the open air Then come back refreshed and vigorous
for the practice of writing
In general the light should fall on the paper from the left side
thus enabling a writer to clearly see the ruled lines and render the
labor of writing easier and more rapid If one writes lefthanded of
course He will sit so as to get his light from the right side or over
the right shoulder
SHADING
As a beautifier of the handwriting by causing a diversity of light
and shade among the letters shading has its value but in the
practical handwriting for business purposes it should as a rule be
classed with flourishing and left out Requiring time and effort to
bring down the shades on letters business men clerks and telegraph
operators find a uniform and regular style of writing without shade
the best even though it may not be as artistic
UNIFORMITY
A most necessary element in all good penmanship is uniformity In the
slope of the letters and words which form a written page there must be
no disagreement With the letters leaning about in various directions
writing is presented in its most ridiculous phase Uniformity in the
size of letters throughout the written page how greatly it conduces
to neatness and beauty All letters resting on the line and being of
uniform hight adds another condition towards good penmanship This
essential element of uniformity may be watched and guarded closely and
cultivated by any learner in his own practice
SLANT OF WRITING
As said before it matters not so much what angle of slant is adopted
in writing provided it is made uniform and all letters are required
to conform exactly to the same slant Writing which is nearest
perpendicular is most legible and hence is preferable for business
purposes The printed page of perpendicular type how legible it is
But for ease in execution writing should slant It follows then that
writing should be made as perpendicular as is consistent with ease of
execution The slant of writing should not be less than sixty degrees
from the horizontal
Illustration Position of Body While Standing
POSITION of the BODY WHILE STANDING
The practical bookkeeper finds it advantageous to do his writing
while standing in fact where large books are in use and entries are
to be transferred from one to another the work of the bookkeeper
can hardly be performed otherwise than in a standing position free to
move about his office Cumbrous books necessitate a different position
at the desk from that of the correspondent or the learner Since
large books must lie squarely on the desk the writer in order to
have the proper position thereto must place his left side to the
desk The body thus has the same relative position as if squarely
fronting the desk with the paper or book placed diagonally In other
words the writer while engaged in writing in large heavy books
must adjust himself to the position of the books Should the
correspondent or bill clerk perform his work while standing he would
assume the same as the sitting positionsquarely fronting the desk
LEGIBILITY
Children in learning to write are apt to sacrifice all other
good qualities of beauty regularity and grace for the quality of
legibility or plainness With some older persons this legibility is
considered of very little consequence and is obscured by all manner
of meaningless flourishes in which the writer takes pride In the
estimation of the business man writing is injured by shades and
flourishes The demand of this practical time is a plain regular
style that can be written rapidly and read at a glance
Illustration
FINISH
By a careless habit which many persons allow themselves to fall into
they omit to attend to the little things in writing Good penmanship
consists in attention to small details each letter and word correctly
formed makes the beautiful page By inattention to the finish of one
letter or part of a letter of a word oftentimes the word is mistaken
for another and the entire meaning changed Particular attention
should be devoted to the finish of some of the small letters such as
the dotting of the i or crossing of the t Blending the lines which
form a loop often causes the letter to become a stem similar to the
t or d or an e to become an i In many of the capital letters the
want of attention to the finish of the letter converts it into another
or destroys its identity such for instance as the small cross on
the capital F which if left off makes the letter a T The W often
becomes an M or vice versa and the I a J Mistakes in this regard
are more the result of carelessness and inattention than anything
else By careful practice a person will acquire a settled habit of
giving a perfection to each letter and word and then it is no longer
a task but is performed naturally and almost involuntarily while
the difference in the appearance of the written page as well as the
exactness and certainty of the meaning conveyed may be incalculably
great
While practicing penmanship or while endeavoring to correct a
careless habit in writing the mind must be upon the work in hand
and not be allowed to wander into fields of thought or imagination
by thus confining the attention any defect or imperfection in the
formation of letters may be soon mastered or corrected
Illustration Position of the Hand and Pen
POSITION OF THE HAND AND PEN
The right arm should rest on the muscles just below the elbow and
wrist should be elevated so as to move free from paper and desk Turn
the hand so that the wrist will be level or so that the back of
the hand will face the ceiling The third and fourth fingers turned
slightly underneath the hand will form its support and the pen these
fingers and the muscles of the arm near the elbow form the only points
of rest or contact on desk or paper The pen should point over the
shoulder and should be so held that it may pass the root of the nail
on the second finger and about opposite the knuckle of the hand An
unnatural or cramped position of the hand like such a position of the
body is opposed to good writing and after many years of observation
and study all teachers concur in the one position above described
as being the most natural easy and graceful for the writer and as
affording the most freedom and strength of movement
Avoid getting the hand in an awkward or tiresome position rolling it
over to one side or drawing the fore finger up into a crooked shape
Hold the pen firmly but lightly not with a grip as if it were about
to escape from service Do not say I cant hold the pen correctly
Habits are strong but will may be stronger and if you hold the pen
correctly in spite of old habits for a few lessons all will then
be easy and the pen will take its position at each writing exercise
with no effort whatever Everything being in readiness and the proper
position assumed the writer must now obtain complete control of hand
and pen by practice in movement
Illustration
RAPIDITY
One of the essentials of a practical business style of writing must be
rapidity of execution in order to be of any avail in the necessities
and press of a business position The demand of the merchant is that
his clerk shall not only write well but with rapidity and the
volume of letters to be answered bills to be made out or items to be
entered on the books of account compel the clerk to move the pen
with dexterity and rapidity as well as skill While there is great
diversity among persons as to the rapidity as well as quality of their
penmanship some being naturally more alert and active than others
yet by securing the proper position of the hand arm and body
favorable to ease and freedom of execution then following this with
careful practice in movement until all the varied motions necessary
in writing are thoroughly mastered the person may with suitable
effort acquire the quality of rapidity in writing gradually
increasing the speed until the desired rate is accomplished
BEAUTY
In the handwriting as in other things beauty is largely a matter
of taste and education To the man of business the most beautiful
handwriting is that which is written with ease and expresses plainly
and neatly the thought of the writer To the professional or artistic
taste while such a hand may be regarded as a good business hand it
would not be considered as beautiful because it conforms to no rule
as to proportion shade and spacing In the practical art of writing
it is not very unfair to measure its beauty largely by its utility
Illustration Movement
MOVEMENT
Finger movement or writing by the use of the fingers as the motive
power is entirely inadequate to the requirements of business The
fingers soon become tired the hand becomes cramped the writing shows
a labored effort and lacks freedom and ease so essential to good
business penmanship In the office or countingroom where the clerk
or correspondent must write from morning till night the finger
movement of course cannot be used
What is designated by writing teachers as the Whole Arm or Free Arm
Movement in which the arm is lifted free from the desk and completes
the letter with a dash or a swoop is necessary in ornamental
penmanship and flourishing but has no place in a practical style of
business writing The man of business would hardly stop in the midst
of his writing to raise the arm and execute an offhand capital
while customers are waiting
But adapted to the practical purposes of business is the muscular
movement in which the arm moves freely on the muscles below the
elbow and in cases of precise writing or in the more extended
letters such as f is assisted by a slight movement of the fingers
The third and fourth fingers may remain stationary on the paper
and be moved from time to time or between words where careful and
accurate writing is desired but in more rapid free and flowing
penmanship the fingers should slide over the paper
MOVEMENT EXERCISES
Having everything in readiness the student may begin his practice on
movement exercises the object of which is to obtain control of the
pen and train the muscles Circular motion as in the capital O
reversed as in the capital W vertical movement as in f long s and
capital J and the lateral motion as in small letters must each be
practiced in order to be able to move the pen in any direction up
down or sidewise
The simplest exercise in movement Try to follow around in the same
line as nearly as possible Do not shade
Illustration O O 8
The same exercise only with ovals drawn out and and slight shade
added to each down stroke
Illustration coils
Sides of ovals should be even forming as nearly a straight line as
possible Reverse the movement as in third form
Illustration coils
The following three exercises embrace the essential elements in capital
letters and should at first be made large for purposes of movement
Capital O down strokes parallel
Illustration O Q O Q O O Q O Q O
Capital stem Down stroke a compound curve Shade low Finish with a
dash
Illustration d d d d d d d d d
Capital loop Curves parallel First curve highest
Illustration O O O O double overlapping loops
Having succeeded to some extent with these exercises the learner may
next undertake the vertical movement In order to obtain the lateral
movement which enables one to write long words without lifting the
pen and move easily and gracefully across the page exercises like
the following should be practiced
Down strokes straight Even and resting on line
Illustration uuuuuuuuuuu
In all movement exercises the third and fourth fingers should slide
on the paper and the finger movement should be carefully avoided The
different movements having been practiced they may now be combined in
various forms
Illustration u u u u u n n n n n
Lateral and rolling movement combined Vertical movement and rolling
movement combined
Illustration t t t
Do not shade the circles Lines should be parallel
Movement exercises may be multiplied almost indefinitely by studying
the forms used in writing and their combinations Repeating many of
the small letters such as m u e r s a d h and c also capitals
D J P etc forms an excellent exercise for the learner
PRINCIPLES IN WRITING
In order to enable the learner to examine analyze and criticise
his writing the following principles are given as his standards of
measurements and form By combining them in various ways the essential
part of all letters in the alphabet may be formed
Illustration eight common strokes
The principles must be first carefully studied and separated into the
primary lines which compose them and the form of each principle well
understood The student may then form a scale like the one following by
dividing the distance between the blue lines on the paper into four
equal spaces with a lightly ruled line The letters of the small
alphabet should then be placed in the scale and the Transcribers Note
The original text reads hight height of each letter fixed in the
mind
Illustration lowercase cursive alphabet
Notice that the contracted letters or those which occupy only one
space as a m n o s v w and e and that part of d g h q and
y found in the first space are all well rounded and developed
These letters and parts of letters found in the first space form the
essential part of all writing and therefore deserve especial care
Also notice that the loop letters above the line such as b f h k
and l extend two and onehalf spaces above the blue line while
the loop below the line such as g f j q y and z extend one and
onehalf spaces below the blue line thus two and onehalf and one and
onehalf making the four spaces of the scale and the upper loops on
one line will just meet the lower loops of the line above but never
conflict to the destruction of neat body writing Notice the type
of the printer The extensions above the shorter letters are quite
insignificant and are only used to save the letter from resembling
some other letter of the alphabet They never conflict and how
legible they are
Illustration The Types A Resemblance An Absurdity
Besides to make long loops requires more time and more power with
the pen while shorter loops are in every way easier to acquire
quicker and better Telegraph operators some of whom are among our
best business penmen make all extended letters very short while
accountants and business men favor the style of short loops well
developed letters and small capitals
Apply the principles Observe regularity Muscular movement
Illustration v and u strokes
Down strokes straight Up strokes curved
Illustration n and m strokes

they can be made with regularity and ease

Place the capital letters on the scale analyze them according to
principles 6 7 and 8 and notice their relative proportions
Illustration uppercase cursive alphabet
In order to practice capital letters to advantage as well as to study
them collect in a group or family all those letters which have
some one form or principle as an essential part Take first the 6th
principle or oval and we group the letters as follows
Illustration O D C E P Q R
The excellence of an oval depends largely on its fullness and
roundness No corners or flat sides
Down strokes parallel
Capital D is a Capital O with a knot on the lower corner

Illustration P Prince Prayer P R Regan R Raymond R
The letters in which the capital stem or 7th principle forms a
leading part may be grouped as follows
Illustration H K F T S S G
In the H and K the capital stem is almost straight on the down
stroke in the F and T it is little more of a wave line and in S and
L the line is much of a compound or double curve
Illustration H Hand Hunter Hinder K Kingdom Ky
Illustration F Famine Fremont T Tenement Troy
Illustration S Sumpter St S Sarimore G Grammar
The capital I and also the J which is a modified I are sometimes
classed among the capital stem letters from the resemblance of the I
to this principle in all but the top
