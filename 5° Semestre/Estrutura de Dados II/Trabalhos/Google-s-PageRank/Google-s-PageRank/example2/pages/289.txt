It all seemed too good to be true Hither and thither through the
meadows he rambled busily along the hedgerows across the
copses finding everywhere birds building flowers budding leaves
thrustingeverything happy and progressive and occupied And instead
of having an uneasy conscience pricking him and whispering whitewash
he somehow could only feel how jolly it was to be the only idle dog
among all these busy citizens After all the best part of a holiday
is perhaps not so much to be resting yourself as to see all the other
fellows busy working
He thought his happiness was complete when as he meandered aimlessly
along suddenly he stood by the edge of a fullfed river Never in
his life had he seen a river beforethis sleek sinuous fullbodied
animal chasing and chuckling gripping things with a gurgle and
leaving them with a laugh to fling itself on fresh playmates that shook
themselves free and were caught and held again All was ashake and
ashiverglints and gleams and sparkles rustle and swirl chatter and
bubble The Mole was bewitched entranced fascinated By the side of
the river he trotted as one trots when very small by the side of a man
who holds one spellbound by exciting stories and when tired at
last he sat on the bank while the river still chattered on to him
a babbling procession of the best stories in the world sent from the
heart of the earth to be told at last to the insatiable sea
As he sat on the grass and looked across the river a dark hole in the
bank opposite just above the waters edge caught his eye and dreamily
he fell to considering what a nice snug dwellingplace it would make for
an animal with few wants and fond of a bijou riverside residence above
flood level and remote from noise and dust As he gazed something
bright and small seemed to twinkle down in the heart of it vanished
then twinkled once more like a tiny star But it could hardly be a star
in such an unlikely situation and it was too glittering and small for a
glowworm Then as he looked it winked at him and so declared itself
to be an eye and a small face began gradually to grow up round it like
a frame round a picture
A brown little face with whiskers
A grave round face with the same twinkle in its eye that had first
attracted his notice
Small neat ears and thick silky hair
It was the Water Rat
Then the two animals stood and regarded each other cautiously
Hullo Mole said the Water Rat
Hullo Rat said the Mole
Would you like to come over enquired the Rat presently
Oh its all very well to TALK said the Mole rather pettishly he
being new to a river and riverside life and its ways
The Rat said nothing but stooped and unfastened a rope and hauled
on it then lightly stepped into a little boat which the Mole had not
observed It was painted blue outside and white within and was just the
size for two animals and the Moles whole heart went out to it at once
even though he did not yet fully understand its uses
The Rat sculled smartly across and made fast Then he held up his
forepaw as the Mole stepped gingerly down Lean on that he said
Now then step lively and the Mole to his surprise and rapture found
himself actually seated in the stern of a real boat
This has been a wonderful day said he as the Rat shoved off and took
to the sculls again Do you know Ive never been in a boat before in
all my life
What cried the Rat openmouthed Never been in ayou neverwell
Iwhat have you been doing then
Is it so nice as all that asked the Mole shyly though he was quite
prepared to believe it as he leant back in his seat and surveyed the
cushions the oars the rowlocks and all the fascinating fittings and
felt the boat sway lightly under him
Nice Its the ONLY thing said the Water Rat solemnly as he
leant forward for his stroke Believe me my young friend there is
NOTHINGabsolute nothinghalf so much worth doing as simply
messing about in boats Simply messing he went on dreamily
messingaboutinboats messing
Look ahead Rat cried the Mole suddenly
It was too late The boat struck the bank full tilt The dreamer the
joyous oarsman lay on his back at the bottom of the boat his heels in
the air
about in boatsor WITH boats the Rat went on composedly picking
himself up with a pleasant laugh In or out of em it doesnt matter
Nothing seems really to matter thats the charm of it Whether you get
away or whether you dont whether you arrive at your destination or
whether you reach somewhere else or whether you never get anywhere at
all youre always busy and you never do anything in particular and
when youve done it theres always something else to do and you can do
it if you like but youd much better not Look here If youve really
nothing else on hand this morning supposing we drop down the river
together and have a long day of it
The Mole waggled his toes from sheer happiness spread his chest with
a sigh of full contentment and leaned back blissfully into the soft
cushions WHAT a day Im having he said Let us start at once
Hold hard a minute then said the Rat He looped the painter through
a ring in his landingstage climbed up into his hole above and after
a short interval reappeared staggering under a fat wicker
luncheonbasket
Shove that under your feet he observed to the Mole as he passed
it down into the boat Then he untied the painter and took the sculls
again
Whats inside it asked the Mole wriggling with curiosity
Theres cold chicken inside it replied the Rat briefly
coldtonguecoldhamcoldbeefpickledgherkinssaladfrenchrollscresssan
dwichespottedmeatgingerbeerlemonadesodawater
O stop stop cried the Mole in ecstacies This is too much
Do you really think so enquired the Rat seriously Its only what I
always take on these little excursions and the other animals are always
telling me that Im a mean beast and cut it VERY fine
The Mole never heard a word he was saying Absorbed in the new life he
was entering upon intoxicated with the sparkle the ripple the scents
and the sounds and the sunlight he trailed a paw in the water and
dreamed long waking dreams The Water Rat like the good little fellow
he was sculled steadily on and forebore to disturb him
I like your clothes awfully old chap he remarked after some half
an hour or so had passed Im going to get a black velvet smokingsuit
myself some day as soon as I can afford it
I beg your pardon said the Mole pulling himself together with an
effort You must think me very rude but all this is so new to me
SothisisaRiver
THE River corrected the Rat
And you really live by the river What a jolly life
By it and with it and on it and in it said the Rat Its brother
and sister to me and aunts and company and food and drink and
naturally washing Its my world and I dont want any other What it
hasnt got is not worth having and what it doesnt know is not worth
knowing Lord the times weve had together Whether in winter or
summer spring or autumn its always got its fun and its excitements
When the floods are on in February and my cellars and basement are
brimming with drink thats no good to me and the brown water runs by my
best bedroom window or again when it all drops away and shows patches
of mud that smells like plumcake and the rushes and weed clog the
channels and I can potter about dry shod over most of the bed of it and
find fresh food to eat and things careless people have dropped out of
boats
But isnt it a bit dull at times the Mole ventured to ask Just you
and the river and no one else to pass a word with
No one else towell I mustnt be hard on you said the Rat with
forbearance Youre new to it and of course you dont know The bank
is so crowded nowadays that many people are moving away altogether O
no it isnt what it used to be at all Otters kingfishers dabchicks
moorhens all of them about all day long and always wanting you to DO
somethingas if a fellow had no business of his own to attend to
What lies over THERE asked the Mole waving a paw towards a background
of woodland that darkly framed the watermeadows on one side of the
river
That O thats just the Wild Wood said the Rat shortly We dont go
there very much we riverbankers
Arent theyarent they very NICE people in there said the Mole a
trifle nervously
Well replied the Rat let me see The squirrels are all right AND
the rabbitssome of em but rabbits are a mixed lot And then theres
Badger of course He lives right in the heart of it wouldnt live
anywhere else either if you paid him to do it Dear old Badger Nobody
interferes with HIM Theyd better not he added significantly
Why who SHOULD interfere with him asked the Mole
Well of coursethereare others explained the Rat in a hesitating
sort of way
Weaselsand stoatsand foxesand so on Theyre all right in a
wayIm very good friends with thempass the time of day when we meet
and all thatbut they break out sometimes theres no denying it and
thenwell you cant really trust them and thats the fact
The Mole knew well that it is quite against animaletiquette to dwell
on possible trouble ahead or even to allude to it so he dropped the
subject
And beyond the Wild Wood again he asked Where its all blue
and dim and one sees what may be hills or perhaps they maynt and
something like the smoke of towns or is it only clouddrift
Beyond the Wild Wood comes the Wide World said the Rat And thats
something that doesnt matter either to you or me Ive never been
there and Im never going nor you either if youve got any sense
at all Dont ever refer to it again please Now then Heres our
backwater at last where were going to lunch
Leaving the main stream they now passed into what seemed at first sight
like a little landlocked lake Green turf sloped down to either edge
brown snaky treeroots gleamed below the surface of the quiet water
while ahead of them the silvery shoulder and foamy tumble of a weir
arminarm with a restless dripping millwheel that held up in its
turn a greygabled millhouse filled the air with a soothing murmur
of sound dull and smothery yet with little clear voices speaking up
cheerfully out of it at intervals It was so very beautiful that the
Mole could only hold up both forepaws and gasp O my O my O my
The Rat brought the boat alongside the bank made her fast helped the
still awkward Mole safely ashore and swung out the luncheonbasket The
Mole begged as a favour to be allowed to unpack it all by himself and
the Rat was very pleased to indulge him and to sprawl at full length on
the grass and rest while his excited friend shook out the tablecloth
and spread it took out all the mysterious packets one by one and
arranged their contents in due order still gasping O my O my at
each fresh revelation When all was ready the Rat said Now pitch
in old fellow and the Mole was indeed very glad to obey for he had
started his springcleaning at a very early hour that morning as people
WILL do and had not paused for bite or sup and he had been through a
very great deal since that distant time which now seemed so many days
ago
What are you looking at said the Rat presently when the edge of
their hunger was somewhat dulled and the Moles eyes were able to
wander off the tablecloth a little
I am looking said the Mole at a streak of bubbles that I see
travelling along the surface of the water That is a thing that strikes
me as funny
Bubbles Oho said the Rat and chirruped cheerily in an inviting sort
of way
A broad glistening muzzle showed itself above the edge of the bank and
the Otter hauled himself out and shook the water from his coat
Greedy beggars he observed making for the provender Why didnt you
invite me Ratty
This was an impromptu affair explained the Rat By the waymy
friend Mr Mole
Proud Im sure said the Otter and the two animals were friends
forthwith
Such a rumpus everywhere continued the Otter All the world seems
out on the river today I came up this backwater to try and get a
moments peace and then stumble upon you fellowsAt leastI beg
pardonI dont exactly mean that you know
There was a rustle behind them proceeding from a hedge wherein last
years leaves still clung thick and a stripy head with high shoulders
behind it peered forth on them
Come on old Badger shouted the Rat
The Badger trotted forward a pace or two then grunted Hm Company
and turned his back and disappeared from view
Thats JUST the sort of fellow he is observed the disappointed Rat
Simply hates Society Now we shant see any more of him today Well
tell us WHOS out on the river
Toads out for one replied the Otter In his brandnew wagerboat
new togs new everything
The two animals looked at each other and laughed
Once it was nothing but sailing said the Rat Then he tired of that
and took to punting Nothing would please him but to punt all day
and every day and a nice mess he made of it Last year it was
houseboating and we all had to go and stay with him in his houseboat
and pretend we liked it He was going to spend the rest of his life in
a houseboat Its all the same whatever he takes up he gets tired of
it and starts on something fresh
Such a good fellow too remarked the Otter reflectively But no
stabilityespecially in a boat
From where they sat they could get a glimpse of the main stream across
the island that separated them and just then a wagerboat flashed into
view the rowera short stout figuresplashing badly and rolling a
good deal but working his hardest The Rat stood up and hailed him but
Toadfor it was heshook his head and settled sternly to his work
Hell be out of the boat in a minute if he rolls like that said the
Rat sitting down again
Of course he will chuckled the Otter Did I ever tell you that good
story about Toad and the lockkeeper It happened this way Toad
An errant Mayfly swerved unsteadily athwart the current in the
intoxicated fashion affected by young bloods of Mayflies seeing life A
swirl of water and a cloop and the Mayfly was visible no more
Neither was the Otter
The Mole looked down The voice was still in his ears but the turf
whereon he had sprawled was clearly vacant Not an Otter to be seen as
far as the distant horizon
But again there was a streak of bubbles on the surface of the river
The Rat hummed a tune and the Mole recollected that animaletiquette
forbade any sort of comment on the sudden disappearance of ones friends
at any moment for any reason or no reason whatever
Well well said the Rat I suppose we ought to be moving I wonder
which of us had better pack the luncheonbasket He did not speak as if
he was frightfully eager for the treat
O please let me said the Mole So of course the Rat let him
Packing the basket was not quite such pleasant work as unpacking the
basket It never is But the Mole was bent on enjoying everything and
although just when he had got the basket packed and strapped up tightly
he saw a plate staring up at him from the grass and when the job had
been done again the Rat pointed out a fork which anybody ought to
have seen and last of all behold the mustard pot which he had been
sitting on without knowing itstill somehow the thing got finished at
last without much loss of temper
The afternoon sun was getting low as the Rat sculled gently homewards in
a dreamy mood murmuring poetrythings over to himself and not paying
much attention to Mole But the Mole was very full of lunch and
selfsatisfaction and pride and already quite at home in a boat so he
thought and was getting a bit restless besides and presently he said
Ratty Please I want to row now
The Rat shook his head with a smile Not yet my young friend he
saidwait till youve had a few lessons Its not so easy as it
looks
The Mole was quiet for a minute or two But he began to feel more and
more jealous of Rat sculling so strongly and so easily along and his
pride began to whisper that he could do it every bit as well He jumped
up and seized the sculls so suddenly that the Rat who was gazing out
over the water and saying more poetrythings to himself was taken by
surprise and fell backwards off his seat with his legs in the air for
the second time while the triumphant Mole took his place and grabbed
the sculls with entire confidence
Stop it you SILLY ass cried the Rat from the bottom of the boat
You cant do it Youll have us over
The Mole flung his sculls back with a flourish and made a great dig at
the water He missed the surface altogether his legs flew up above
his head and he found himself lying on the top of the prostrate Rat
Greatly alarmed he made a grab at the side of the boat and the next
momentSploosh
Over went the boat and he found himself struggling in the river
O my how cold the water was and O how VERY wet it felt How it sang
in his ears as he went down down down How bright and welcome the sun
looked as he rose to the surface coughing and spluttering How black was
his despair when he felt himself sinking again Then a firm paw gripped
him by the back of his neck It was the Rat and he was evidently
laughingthe Mole could FEEL him laughing right down his arm and
through his paw and so into histhe Molesneck
The Rat got hold of a scull and shoved it under the Moles arm then he
did the same by the other side of him and swimming behind propelled
the helpless animal to shore hauled him out and set him down on the
bank a squashy pulpy lump of misery
When the Rat had rubbed him down a bit and wrung some of the wet out of
him he said Now then old fellow Trot up and down the towingpath
as hard as you can till youre warm and dry again while I dive for the
luncheonbasket
So the dismal Mole wet without and ashamed within trotted about till
he was fairly dry while the Rat plunged into the water again recovered
the boat righted her and made her fast fetched his floating
property to shore by degrees and finally dived successfully for the
luncheonbasket and struggled to land with it
When all was ready for a start once more the Mole limp and dejected
took his seat in the stern of the boat and as they set off he said in
a low voice broken with emotion Ratty my generous friend I am very
sorry indeed for my foolish and ungrateful conduct My heart quite fails
me when I think how I might have lost that beautiful luncheonbasket
Indeed I have been a complete ass and I know it Will you overlook it
this once and forgive me and let things go on as before
Thats all right bless you responded the Rat cheerily Whats a
little wet to a Water Rat Im more in the water than out of it most
days Dont you think any more about it and look here I really think
you had better come and stop with me for a little time Its very plain
and rough you knownot like Toads house at allbut you havent seen
that yet still I can make you comfortable And Ill teach you to row
and to swim and youll soon be as handy on the water as any of us
The Mole was so touched by his kind manner of speaking that he could
find no voice to answer him and he had to brush away a tear or two with
the back of his paw But the Rat kindly looked in another direction and
presently the Moles spirits revived again and he was even able to give
some straight backtalk to a couple of moorhens who were sniggering to
each other about his bedraggled appearance
When they got home the Rat made a bright fire in the parlour and
planted the Mole in an armchair in front of it having fetched down
a dressinggown and slippers for him and told him river stories till
suppertime Very thrilling stories they were too to an earthdwelling
animal like Mole Stories about weirs and sudden floods and leaping
pike and steamers that flung hard bottlesat least bottles were
certainly flung and FROM steamers so presumably BY them and about
herons and how particular they were whom they spoke to and about
adventures down drains and nightfishings with Otter or excursions far
afield with Badger Supper was a most cheerful meal but very shortly
afterwards a terribly sleepy Mole had to be escorted upstairs by his
considerate host to the best bedroom where he soon laid his head on
his pillow in great peace and contentment knowing that his newfound
friend the River was lapping the sill of his window
This day was only the first of many similar ones for the emancipated
Mole each of them longer and full of interest as the ripening summer
moved onward He learnt to swim and to row and entered into the joy
of running water and with his ear to the reedstems he caught at
intervals something of what the wind went whispering so constantly
among them
II THE OPEN ROAD
Ratty said the Mole suddenly one bright summer morning if you
please I want to ask you a favour
The Rat was sitting on the river bank singing a little song He had
just composed it himself so he was very taken up with it and would not
pay proper attention to Mole or anything else Since early morning he
had been swimming in the river in company with his friends the ducks
And when the ducks stood on their heads suddenly as ducks will he
would dive down and tickle their necks just under where their chins
would be if ducks had chins till they were forced to come to the
surface again in a hurry spluttering and angry and shaking their
feathers at him for it is impossible to say quite ALL you feel when
your head is under water At last they implored him to go away and
attend to his own affairs and leave them to mind theirs So the Rat went
away and sat on the river bank in the sun and made up a song about
them which he called
DUCKS DITTY
All along the backwater
Through the rushes tall
Ducks are adabbling
Up tails all
Ducks tails drakes tails
Yellow feet aquiver
Yellow bills all out of sight
Busy in the river
Slushy green undergrowth
Where the roach swim
Here we keep our larder
Cool and full and dim
Everyone for what he likes
We like to be
Heads down tails up
Dabbling free
High in the blue above
Swifts whirl and call
We are down adabbling
Uptails all
I dont know that I think so VERY much of that little song Rat
observed the Mole cautiously He was no poet himself and didnt care who
knew it and he had a candid nature
Nor dont the ducks neither replied the Rat cheerfully They say
WHY cant fellows be allowed to do what they like WHEN they like and AS
they like instead of other fellows sitting on banks and watching them
all the time and making remarks and poetry and things about them What
NONSENSE it all is Thats what the ducks say
So it is so it is said the Mole with great heartiness
No it isnt cried the Rat indignantly
Well then it isnt it isnt replied the Mole soothingly But what
I wanted to ask you was wont you take me to call on Mr Toad Ive
heard so much about him and I do so want to make his acquaintance
Why certainly said the goodnatured Rat jumping to his feet and
dismissing poetry from his mind for the day Get the boat out and
well paddle up there at once Its never the wrong time to call on
Toad Early or late hes always the same fellow Always goodtempered
always glad to see you always sorry when you go
He must be a very nice animal observed the Mole as he got into the
boat and took the sculls while the Rat settled himself comfortably in
the stern
He is indeed the best of animals replied Rat So simple so
goodnatured and so affectionate Perhaps hes not very cleverwe
cant all be geniuses and it may be that he is both boastful and
conceited But he has got some great qualities has Toady
Rounding a bend in the river they came in sight of a handsome
dignified old house of mellowed red brick with wellkept lawns reaching
down to the waters edge
Theres Toad Hall said the Rat and that creek on the left where
the noticeboard says Private No landing allowed leads to his
boathouse where well leave the boat The stables are over there to
the right Thats the banquetinghall youre looking at nowvery old
that is Toad is rather rich you know and this is really one of the
nicest houses in these parts though we never admit as much to Toad
They glided up the creek and the Mole slipped his sculls as they passed
into the shadow of a large boathouse Here they saw many handsome
boats slung from the cross beams or hauled up on a slip but none in
the water and the place had an unused and a deserted air
The Rat looked around him I understand said he Boating is played
out Hes tired of it and done with it I wonder what new fad he has
taken up now Come along and lets look him up We shall hear all about
it quite soon enough
They disembarked and strolled across the gay flowerdecked lawns in
search of Toad whom they presently happened upon resting in a wicker
gardenchair with a preoccupied expression of face and a large map
spread out on his knees
Hooray he cried jumping up on seeing them this is splendid He
shook the paws of both of them warmly never waiting for an introduction
to the Mole How KIND of you he went on dancing round them I was
just going to send a boat down the river for you Ratty with strict
orders that you were to be fetched up here at once whatever you were
doing I want you badlyboth of you Now what will you take Come
inside and have something You dont know how lucky it is your turning
up just now
Lets sit quiet a bit Toady said the Rat throwing himself into an
easy chair while the Mole took another by the side of him and made some
civil remark about Toads delightful residence
Finest house on the whole river cried Toad boisterously Or anywhere
else for that matter he could not help adding
Here the Rat nudged the Mole Unfortunately the Toad saw him do it and
turned very red There was a moments painful silence Then Toad burst
out laughing All right Ratty he said Its only my way you know
And its not such a very bad house is it You know you rather like it
yourself Now look here Lets be sensible You are the very animals I
wanted Youve got to help me Its most important
Its about your rowing I suppose said the Rat with an innocent air
Youre getting on fairly well though you splash a good bit still With
a great deal of patience and any quantity of coaching you may
O pooh boating interrupted the Toad in great disgust Silly boyish
amusement Ive given that up LONG ago Sheer waste of time thats what
it is It makes me downright sorry to see you fellows who ought to
know better spending all your energies in that aimless manner No Ive
discovered the real thing the only genuine occupation for a life time
I propose to devote the remainder of mine to it and can only regret the
wasted years that lie behind me squandered in trivialities Come with
me dear Ratty and your amiable friend also if he will be so very
good just as far as the stableyard and you shall see what you shall
see
He led the way to the stableyard accordingly the Rat following with
a most mistrustful expression and there drawn out of the coach house
into the open they saw a gipsy caravan shining with newness painted a
canaryyellow picked out with green and red wheels
There you are cried the Toad straddling and expanding himself
Theres real life for you embodied in that little cart The open road
the dusty highway the heath the common the hedgerows the rolling
downs Camps villages towns cities Here today up and off to
somewhere else tomorrow Travel change interest excitement The
whole world before you and a horizon thats always changing And mind
this is the very finest cart of its sort that was ever built without
any exception Come inside and look at the arrangements Planned em all
myself I did
The Mole was tremendously interested and excited and followed him
eagerly up the steps and into the interior of the caravan The Rat only
snorted and thrust his hands deep into his pockets remaining where he
was
It was indeed very compact and comfortable Little sleeping bunksa
little table that folded up against the walla cookingstove lockers
bookshelves a birdcage with a bird in it and pots pans jugs and
kettles of every size and variety
All complete said the Toad triumphantly pulling open a locker You
seebiscuits potted lobster sardineseverything you can possibly
want Sodawater herebaccy thereletterpaper bacon jam cards and
dominoesyoull find he continued as they descended the steps again
youll find that nothing what ever has been forgotten when we make our
start this afternoon
I beg your pardon said the Rat slowly as he chewed a straw but
did I overhear you say something about WE and START and THIS
AFTERNOON
Now you dear good old Ratty said Toad imploringly dont begin
talking in that stiff and sniffy sort of way because you know youve
GOT to come I cant possibly manage without you so please consider it
settled and dont argueits the one thing I cant stand You surely
dont mean to stick to your dull fusty old river all your life and just
live in a hole in a bank and BOAT I want to show you the world Im
going to make an ANIMAL of you my boy
I dont care said the Rat doggedly Im not coming and thats
flat And I AM going to stick to my old river AND live in a hole AND
boat as Ive always done And whats more Moles going to stick me and
do as I do arent you Mole
Of course I am said the Mole loyally Ill always stick to you
