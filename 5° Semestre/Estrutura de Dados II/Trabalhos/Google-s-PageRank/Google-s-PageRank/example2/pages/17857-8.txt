Forgotten Books of the American Nursery
CHAPTER I
Introductory
A shelf full of books belonging to the American children of colonial
times and of the early days of the Republic presents a strangely
unfamiliar and curious appearance If chronologically placed the
earliest coverless chapbooks are hardly noticeable next to their
immediate successors with wooden sides and these in turn are
dominated by the gilt silver and many colored bindings of diminutive
dimensions which hold the stories dear to the childish heart from
Revolutionary days to the beginning of the nineteenth century Then
bright blue salmon yellow and marbled paper covers make a vivid
display which as the century grows older fades into the sadcolored
cloth bindings thought adapted to many childrens books of its second
quarter
An examination of their contents shows them to be equally foreign to
present day ideas as to the desirable characteristics for childrens
literature Yet the crooked black type and crude illustrations of the
wholly religious episodes related in the oldest volumes on the shelf the
didactic and moral stories with their tiny typemetal wood and
copperplate pictures of the next groups and the improving American
tales adorned with blurred colored engravings or stiff steel and wood
illustrations that were produced for juvenile amusement in the early
part of the nineteenth centuryall are as interesting to the lover of
children as they are unattractive to the modern children themselves The
little ones very naturally find the stilted language of these old stories
unintelligible and the artificial plots bewildering but to one
interested in the adult literature of the same periods of history an
acquaintance with these amusement books of past generations has a
peculiar charm and value of its own They then become not merely
curiosities but the means of tracing the evolution of an American
literature for children
To the student desiring an intimate acquaintance with any civilized
people its lighter literature is always a great aid to personal
research the more trivial the more detailed the greater the worth to
the investigator are these penpictures as records of the nation he
wishes to know Something of this value have the storybooks of
oldfashioned childhood Trivial as they undoubtedly are they
nevertheless often contain our best sketches of childlife in the
eighteenth and early nineteenth centuriesa life as different from that
of a twentieth century child as was the adult society of those old days
from that of the present time They also enable us to mark as is possible
in no other way the gradual development of a body of writing which
though lagging much behind the adult literature was yet also affected by
the local and social conditions in America
Without attempting to give the history of the evolution of the A B C
book in Englandthe legitimate ancestor of all juvenile bookstwo main
topics must be briefly discussed before entering upon the proper matter
of this volume The first relates to the family life in the early days
of the Massachusetts Commonwealth the province that produced the first
juvenile book The second topic has to do with the literature thought
suitable for children in those early Puritan days These two subjects
are closely related the second being dependent upon the first Both are
necessary to the history of these quaint toy volumes whose stories lack
much meaning unless the conditions of life and literature preceding them
are understood
When the Pilgrim Fathers seeking freedom of faith founded their first
settlements in the new country one of their earliest efforts was
directed toward firmly establishing their own religion This though
nominally free was eventually under the Mathers to become a theocracy
as intolerant as that faith from which they had fled The rocks upon
which this religion was builded were the Bible and the Catechism In
this history of toybooks the catechism is however perhaps almost the
more important to consider for it was a product of the times and
regarded as indispensable to the proper training of a family
The Puritan conception of life as an error to be rectified by suffering
rather than as a joy to be accepted with thanksgiving made the
preparation for death and the dreadful Day of Judgment the chief end of
existence The catechism therefore with its fearinspiring description
of Hell and the consequences of sin became inevitably the chief means of
instructing children in the knowledge of their sinful inheritance In
order to insure a supply of catechisms it was voted by the members of
the company in sixteen hundred and twentynine when preparing to
emigrate to expend 3 shillings for 2 dussen and ten catechismes6A
A contract was also made in the same year with sundry intended ministers
for catechising as also in teaching or causing to be taught the
Companyes servants  their children as also the salvages and their
children6B Parents especially the mothers were continually
exhorted in sermons preached for a century after the founding of the
colony to catechize the children every day that said Cotton Mather
you may be continually dropping something of the Catechism upon them
Some Honey out of the Rock Indeed the learned divine seems to have
regarded it as a soothing and toothsome morsel for he even imagined that
the children cried for it continuously saying O our dear Parents
Acquaint us with the Great God Let us not go from your Tender Knees
down to the Place of Dragons Oh not Parents but Ostriches Not
Parents but Prodigies6C
Much dissension soon arose among the ministers of the settlements as to
which catechism should be taught As the result of the discussion the
General Corte which met in sixteen hundred and fortyone desired
that the elders would make a catechism for the instruction of youth in
the grounds of religion6D
To meet this request several clergymen immediately responded Among
them was John Cotton who presumably prepared a small volume which was
entitled Milk for Babes Drawn out of the Breast of Both Testaments
Chiefly for the spiritual nourishment of Boston Babes in either
England But may be of like use for any children For the present
purpose the importance of this little book lies in the supposition that
it was printed at Cambridge by Daye between sixteen hundred and
fortyone and sixteen hundred and fortyfive and therefore was the
first book of any kind written and printed in America for childrenan
importance altogether different from that attached to it by the authors
grandson Cotton Mather when he asserted that Milk for Babes would be
valued and studied and improved till New England cease to be New
England7A
To the little colonials this Catechism of New England was a great
improvement upon any predecessor even upon the Westminster Shorter
Catechism for it reduced the one hundred and seven questions of that
famous body of doctrine to sixtyseven and the longest answer in Milk
for Babes contained only eightyfour words7B
As the century grew older other catechisms were printed The number
produced before the eighteenth century bears witness to the diverse
views in a community in which they were considered an essential for
every member adult or child Among the six hundred titles roughly
computed as the output of the press by seventeen hundred in the new
country eleven different catechisms may be counted with twenty
editions in all of these the titles of four indicate that they were
designed for very little children In each community the pastor
appointed the catechism to be taught in the school and joined the
teacher in drilling the children in its questions and answers Indeed
the answers were regarded as irrefutable in those uncritical days and
hence a strong shield and buckler against manifold temptations provided
by yt ould deluder Satan To offset the task of learning these
doctrines of the church it is probable that the mothers regaled the
little ones with old folklore tales when the family gathered together
around the great livingroom fire in the winter evening or asked
eagerly for a bedtime story in the long summer twilight Tales such as
Jack the Giant Killer Tom Thumb the Children in the Wood and
Guy of Warwick were orally current even among the plain people of
England though frowned upon by many of the Puritan element Therefore
it is at least presumable that these were all familiar to the colonists
In fact it is known that John Dunton in sixteen hundred and
eightysix sold in his Boston warehouse The History of Tom Thumb
which he facetiously offered to an ignorant customer in folio with
Marginal notes Besides these orally related tales of enchantment the
children had a few simple pastimes but at first the few toys were
necessarily of home manufacture On the whole amusements were not
encouraged although In the year sixteen hundred and ninetyfive Mr
Higginson writes Mrs Earle wrote from Massachusetts to his brother
in England that if toys were imported in small quantity to America
they would sell And a venture of this character was certainly made by
seventeen hundred and twelve in Boston Still these were the exception
in a commonwealth where amusements were considered as wiles of the
Devil against whom the ministers constantly warned the congregations
committed to their charge
Home in the seventeenth centuryand indeed in the eighteenth
centurywas a place where for children the rule to be seen not
heard was strictly enforced To read Judge Sewalls diary is to be
convinced that for children to obtain any importance in life death was
necessary Funerals of little ones were of frequent occurrence and were
conducted with great ceremony in which pomp and meagre preparation were
strangely mingled Baby Henry Sewalls funeral procession for instance
included eight ministers the governor and magistrates of the county
and two nurses who bore the little body to the grave into which half
full of water from the raging storm the rude coffin was lowered Death
was kept before the eyes of every member of the colony even
twoyearold babies learned such mournful verse as this
I in the Burying Place may See
Graves Shorter than I
From Deaths Arrest no age is free
Young Children too may die
My God may such an awful Sight
Awakening be to me
Oh that by Grace I might
For Death prepared be
When the younger members of the family are otherwise mentioned in the
Judges diary it is perhaps to note the parents pride in the
eighteenmonthsold infants knowledge of the catechism an acquirement
rewarded by the gift of a red apple but which suggests the reason for
many funerals Or again difficulties with the alphabet are sorrowfully
put down and also deliquencies at the age of four in attending family
prayer with a full account of punishments meted out to the culprit
Such details are indeed but natural for under the stern conditions
imposed by Cotton and the Mathers religion looms large in the
foreground of any sketch of family life handed down from the first
century of the Massachusetts colony Perhaps the very earliest picture
in which a colonial child with a book occupies the centre of the canvas
is that given in a letter of Samuel Sewalls In sixteen hundred and
seventyone he wrote with pride to a friend of little Betty who though
Reading passing well took Three Moneths to Read the first Volume of the
Book of Martyrs as she sat by the firelight at night after her daily
task of spinning was done Foxes Martyrs seems gruesome reading for a
little girl at bedtime but it was so popular in England that with the
Bible and Catechism it was included in the library of all households
that could afford it
Just ten years later in sixteen hundred and eightyone Bunyans
Pilgrims Progress was printed in Boston by Samuel Green and being
easily obtainable superseded in a measure the Book of Martyrs as a
household treasure Bunyans dream according to Macaulay was the daily
conversation of thousands and was received in New England with far
greater eagerness than in the authors own country The children
undoubtedly listened to the talk of their elders and gazed with
wideopen eyes at the execrable plates in the imported editions
illustrating Christians journey After the deaths by fire and sword of
the Martyrs the Pilgrims difficulties in the Slough of Despond or
with the Giant Despair afforded pleasurable reading while Mr Great
Hearts courageous cheerfulness brought practically a new characteristic
into Puritan literature
To Bunyan the children in both old and New England were indebted for
another book entitled A Book for Boys and Girls or Country Rhimes
for Children By JB Licensed and Entered according to Order11A
Printed in London it probably soon made its way to this country where
Bunyan was already so well known This little octavo volume writes
Mrs Field in The Child and his Book was considered a perfect
childs book but was in fact only the literary milk of the unfortunate
babes of the period In the light of modern views upon juvenile reading
and entertainment the Puritan ideal of mental pabulum for little ones
is worth recording in an extract from the preface The following lines
set forth this authors threefold purpose
To show them how each Finglefangle
On which they doting are their souls entangle
As with a Web a Trap a Gin or Snare
While by their Playthings I would them entice
To mount their Thoughts from what are childish Toys
To Heaven for thats prepard for Girls and Boys
Nor do I so confine myself to these
As to shun graver things I seek to please
Those more composd with better things than Toys
Tho thus I would be catching Girls and Boys
In the seventyfour Meditations composing this curious medleytho but
in Homely Rhimesupon subjects familiar to any little girl or boy
none leaves the moral to the imagination Nevertheless it could well
have been a relaxation after the daily drill in A B abs and
catechism to turn the leaves and to spell out this
UPON THE FROG
The Frog by nature is both damp and cold
Her mouth is large her belly much will hold
She sits somewhat ascending loves to be
Croaking in gardens tho unpleasantly
Comparison
The hypocrite is like unto this frog
As like as is the Puppy to the Dog
He is of nature cold his mouth is wide
To prate and at true Goodness to deride
Doubtless too many little Puritans quite envied the child in The Boy
and the Watchmaker a jingle wherein the former said among other
things
This Watch my Father did on me bestow
A Golden one it is but twill not go
Unless it be at an Uncertainty
I think there is no watch as bad as mine
Sometimes tis sullen twill not go at all
And yet twas never broke nor had a fall
The same small boys may even have enjoyed the tedious explanation of the
mechanism of the timepiece given by the Watchmaker and after
skipping the Comparison which made the boy represent a convert and
the watch in his pocket illustrative of Grace within his Heart they
probably turned eagerly to the next Meditation Upon the Boy and his
Paper of Plumbs Weathercocks Hobbyhorses Horses and Drums all
served Bunyan in his effort to point a moral while adorning his tales
In a later edition of these grotesque and quaint conceptions some
alterations were made and a primer was included It then appeared as A
Book for Boys and Girls or Temporal Things Spiritualized and by the
time the ninth edition was reached in seventeen hundred and twentyfour
the book was hardly recognizable as Divine Emblems or Temporal Things
Spiritualized
At present there is no evidence that these rhymes were printed in the
colonies until long after this ninth edition was issued It is possible
that the success attending a book printed in Boston shortly after the
original Country Rhimes was written made the colonial printers feel
that their profit would be greater by devoting spare type and paper to
the now famous New England Primer Moreover it seems peculiarly in
keeping with the cast of the New England mind of the eighteenth century
that although Bunyan had attempted to combine playthings with religious
teaching for the English children for the little colonials the first
combination was the elementary teaching and religious exercises found in
the great Puritan Primer Each child was practically if not verbally
told that
This little Catechism learned by heart for so it ought
The Primer next commanded is for Children to be taught
The Primer however was not a product wholly of New England In sixteen
hundred and eightyfive there had been printed in Boston by Green The
Protestant Tutor for Children a primer a mutilated copy of which is
now owned by the American Antiquarian Society This again to quote
Mr Ford was probably an abridged edition of a book bearing the same
title printed in London with the expressed design of bringing up
children in an aversion to Popery In Protestant New England the
authors purpose naturally called forth profound approbation and in
Greens edition of the Tutor lay the germ of the great picture alphabet
of our forefathers14A The author Benjamin Harris had immigrated
to Boston for personal reasons and coming in contact with the
residents saw the latent possibilities in The Protestant Tutor To
make it more salable writes Mr Ford in The New England Primer the
schoolbook character was increased while to give it an even better
chance of success by an appeal to local pride it was rechristened and
came forth under the now famous title of The New England
Primer14B
A careful examination of the titles contained in the first volume of
Evanss American Bibliography shows how exactly this infants primer
represented the spirit of the times This chronological list of American
imprints of the first one hundred years of the colonial press is largely
a record in type of the religious activity of the country and is
impressive as a witness to the obedience of the press to the law of
supply and demand With the Puritan appetite for a grim religion served
in sermons upon every subject ornamented and seasoned with supposedly
apt Scriptural quotations a demand was created for printed discourses
to be read and inwardly digested at home This demand the printers
supplied Amid such literary conditions the primer came as light food
for infants minds and as such was accepted by parents to impress
religious ideas when teaching the alphabet
It is not by any means certain that the first edition of this great
primer of our ancestors contained illustrations as engravers were few
in America before the eighteenth century Yet it seems altogether
probable that they were introduced early in the next century as by
seventeen hundred and seventeen Benjamin Harris Jr had printed in
Boston The Holy Bible in Verse containing cuts identical with those
in The New England Primer of a somewhat later date and these pictures
could well have served as illustrations for both these books for
childrens use profit and pleasure At all events the thorough
approval by parents and clergy of this small schoolbook soon brought to
many a household the novelty of a real picturebook
Hitherto little children had been perforce content with the few
illustrations the adult books offered Now the printing of this tiny
volume with its curious black pictures accompanying the text of
religious instruction catechism and alphabets marked the milestone on
the long lane that eventually led to the welldrawn pictures in the
modern books for children
It is difficult at so late a day to estimate correctly the pleasure this
famous picture alphabet brought to the various colonial households What
the original illustrations were like can only be inferred from those in
The Holy Bible in Verse and in the later editions of the primer
itself In the Bible Adam or is it Eve stands pointing to a tree
around which a serpent is coiled By seventeen hundred and thirtyseven
the engraver was sufficiently skilled to represent two figures who
stand as colossal statues on either side of the tree whose fruit had
such disastrous effects However at a time when art criticism had no
terrors for the engraver it could well have been a delight to many a
family of little ones to gaze upon
The Lion bold
The Lamb doth hold
and to speculate upon the exact place where the lion ended and the lamb
began The wholly religious character of the book was no drawback to its
popularity for the two great diaries of the time show how absolutely
religion permeated the atmosphere surrounding both old and young
Cotton Mathers diary gives various glimpses of his dealing with his own
and other peoples children His son Increase or Cressy as he was
affectionately called seems to have been particularly unresponsive to
religious coercion Mathers method however appears to have been more
efficacious with the younger members of his family and of Elizabeth and
Samuel seven years of age he wrote My two younger children shall
before the Psalm and prayer answer a Qustion in the catechism and have
their Leaves ready turned unto the proofs of the Answer in the Bible
which they shall distinctly read unto us and show what they prove This
also shall supply a fresh matter for prayer Again he tells of his
table talk Tho I will have my table talk facetious as well as
instructive  yett I will have the Exercise continually intermixed I
will set before them some sentence of the Bible and make some useful
Remarks upon it Other peoples children he taught as occasion offered
even when on the Road in the Woods he wrote on another day I being
desirous to do some Good called some little children  and bestowed
some Instruction with a little Book upon them To children accustomed
to instruction at all hours the amusement found in the pages of the
primer was far greater than in any other book printed in the colonies
for years
Certain titles indicate the nature of the meagre juvenile literary fare
in the beginning of the new eighteenth century In seventeen hundred
Nicholas Boone in his Shop over against the old Meetinghouse in
Boston reprinted Janeways Token for Children To this was added by
the Boston printer a Token for the children of New England or some
examples of children in whom the fear of God was remarkably budding when
they dyed in several parts of New England Of course its author the
Reverend Mr Mather found colonial examples as deeply religious as
any that the mother country could produce but there is for us a grim
humor in these various incidents concerning pious and precocious infants
of thin habit and pale countenance whose pallor became that of death
at so early an age If it was by the repetition of such tales that the
Puritan divine strove to convert Cressy it may well be that the son
considered it better policy since Death claimed the little saints to
remain a sinner
By seventeen hundred and six two juvenile books appeared from the press
of Timothy Green in Boston The first A LITTLE BOOK for
children wherein are set down several directions for little children
and several remarkable stories both ancient and modern of little
children divers whereof are lately deceased was a reprint from an
English book of the same title and therefore has not in this chronicle
the interest of the second book The purpose of its publication is given
in Mathers diary
1706 22d Im Friday
About this Time sending my little son to School Where ye Child was
Learning to Read I did use every morning for diverse months to
Write in a plain Hand for the Child and send thither by him a
Lesson in Verse to be not only read but also Gott by Heart
My proposal was to have the Child improve in goodness at the same
time that he improved in Reading Upon further Thoughts I
apprehended that a Collection of some of them would be serviceable
to ye Good Education of other children So I lett ye printer take
them  print them in some hope of some Help to thereby contributed
unto that great Intention of a Good Education The book is
entituled Good Lessons for Children or Instruction provided for a
little Son to learn at School when learning to Read
Although this small book lives only by record it is safe to assume from
the extracts of the authors diary already quoted that it lacked every
quality of amusement and was adapted only to those whom he described
in a sermon preached before the Governor and Council as verie Sharpe
and early Ripe in their capacities Good Lessons has the distinction
of being the first American book to be composed like many a modern
publication for a particular young child and with its purpose to
improve in goodness struck clearly the keynote of the greater part of
all writing for children during the succeeding one hundred and
seventyfive years
The first glimpse of the amusement book proper appears in that unique
History of Printing in America by Isaiah Thomas This describes
among other old printers one Thomas Fleet who established himself in
Boston about 1713 At first wrote Mr Thomas he printed pamphlets
for booksellers small books for children and ballads in Pudding
Lane19A He owned several negroes one of which  was an ingenious
man and cut on wooden blocks all the pictures which decorated the
ballads and small books for his master19B As corroborative of these
statements Thomas also mentions Thomas Fleet Sr as the putative
compiler of Mother Goose Melodies which he first published in 1719
bearing the title of Songs for the Nursery
Much discussion has arisen as to the earliest edition of Mother Goose
Thomass suggestion as to the origin of the first American edition has
