CHAPTER I
THE CHAPERON
Girlscome down QuickI want to see how you look
Prudence stood at the foot of the stairs deftly drawing on her black
silk glovesgloves still good in Prudences eyes though Fairy had
long since discarded them as unfit for service There was open anxiety
in Prudences expression and puckers of worry perpendicularly creased
her white forehead
Girls she called again Come down Father youd better hurryits
nearly train time Girls are you deaf
Her insistence finally brought response A door opened in the hallway
above and Connie started down the stairs fully dressed except that
she limped along in one stockingfoot her shoe in her hand
Its so silly of you to get all dressed before you put on your shoes
Connie Prudence reproved her as she came down It wrinkles you up so
But you do look nice Wasnt it dear of the Ladies Aid to give you that
dress for your birthday Its so dainty and sweetand goodness knows
you needed one They probably noticed that Let me fix your bow a
little Do be careful dear and dont get mussed before we come back
Aunt Grace will be so much gladder to live with us if we all look sweet
and clean And youll be good wont you Connie andTwins will you
come
They are sewing up the holes in each others stockings Connie
vouchsafed Theyre all dressed
The twins evidently realizing that Prudences patience was near the
breaking point started downstairs for approval a curious procession
All dressed as Connie had said and most charming but they walked close
together Carol stepping gingerly on one foot and Lark stooping low
carrying a needle with great solicitudethe thread reaching from the
needle to a small hole on Carols instep
What on earth are you doing
Im sewing up the holes in Carols stocking Lark explained If you
had waited a minute I would have finishedHold still Caroldont
walk so jerky or youll break the thread There were five holes in her
left stocking Prudence and Im
Prudence frowned disapprovingly Its a very bad habit to sew up holes
in your stockings when you are wearing them If you had darned them all
yesterday as I told you youd have had plenty ofMercy Lark you
have too much powder on
I know itCarol did it She said she wanted me to be of an
intellectual pallor Lark mopped her face with one hand
Youd better not mention to papa that we powdered today Carol
suggested Hes upset Its very hard for a man to be reasonable when
hes upset you know
You look nice twins Prudence advanced a step her eyes on Carols
hair sniffing suspiciously Carol did you curl your hair
Carol blushed Well just a little she confessed I thought Aunt
Grace would appreciate me more with a crown of frizzy ringlets
Youll spoil your hair if you dont leave it alone and it will serve
you right too Its very pretty as it is naturallyplenty curly
enough andOh Fairy I know Aunt Grace will love you she cried
ecstatically You look like a dream you
Yesa nightmare said Carol snippily If I saw Fairy coming at me
on a dark night Id
Papa well miss the train Then as he came slowly down the stairs
she said to her sisters again anxiously Oh girls do keep nice and
clean wont you And be very sweet to Aunt Grace Its soawfully good
of herto comeand take care of us Prudences voice broke a
little The admission of another to the parsonage mothering hurt her
Mr Starr stopped on the bottom step and with one foot as a pivot
slowly revolved for his daughters inspection
How do I look he demanded Do you think this suit will convince
Grace that I am worth taking care of Do I look twentyfive dollars
better than I did yesterday
The girls gazed at him with most adoring and exclamatory approval
Father You look perfectly grandIsnt it beautifulOf course you
looked nicer than anybody else even in the old suit butitwell it
was
Perfectly disgracefully shabby put in Fairy quickly Entirely
unworthy a minister of yourerlovely family
I hope none of you have let it out among the members how long I wore
that old suit I dont believe I could face my congregation on Sundays
if I thought they were mentally calculating the wearing value of my
various garmentsWell have to go PrudenceYou all look very
finea credit to the parsonageand I am sure Aunt Grace will think us
well worth living with
And dont muss the house up begged Prudence as her father opened the
door and pushed her gently out on the step
The four sisters left behind looked at one another solemnly It was a
serious businessmost serious Connie gravely put on her shoe and
buttoned it Lark sewed up the last hole in Carols stockingCarol
balancing herself on one foot with nice precision for the purpose Then
all ready they looked at one another againeven more solemnly
Well said Fairy lets go inand wait
Silently the others followed her in and they all sat about
irreproachably on the welldusted chairs their hands folded
Methodistically in their smooth and spotless laps
The silence and the solemnity were very oppressive
We look all right said Carol belligerently
No one answered
Im sure Aunt Grace is as sweet as anybody could be she added
presently
Dreary silence
Dont we love her better than anybody on earthexcept ourselves
Then when the silence continued her courage waned Oh girls she
whimpered isnt it awful Its the beginning of the end of everything
Outsiders have to come in now to take care of us and Prudencell get
married and then Fairy will and maybe us twinsI mean we twins And
then therell only be father and Connie left and Miss Greet or some
one will get ahead of father after alland Conniell have to live
with a stepmother anditll never seem like home any more and
Connie burst into loud and mournful wails
Youre very silly Carol Fairy said sternly Very silly indeed I
dont see much chance of any of us getting married very soon And
Prudence will be here nearly a year yet AndAunt Grace is as sweet and
dear a woman as ever livedmothers own sisterand she loves us dearly
and
Yes agreed Lark but its not like having Prudence at the head of
things
Prudence will be at the head of things for nearly a year andI think
were mighty lucky to get Aunt Grace Its not many women would be
willing to leave a fine stylish home with a hundred dollars to spend on
just herself and with a maid to wait on her and come to an ugly old
house like this to take care of a preacher and a riotous family like
ours Its very generous of Aunt Gracevery
Yes it is admitted Lark And as long as she was our aunt with her
fine home and her hundred dollars a month and her maid I loved her
dearly ButI dont want anybody coming in to manage us We can manage
ourselves We
We need a chaperon put in Fairy deftly She isnt going to do the
housework or the managing or anything Shes just our chaperon It
isnt proper for us to live without one you know Were too young It
isntconventional
And for goodness sake Connie said Carol remember and call her our
chaperon and dont talk about a housekeeper Theres some style to a
chaperon
Yes indeed said Fairy cheerfully And she wears such pretty
clothes and has such pretty manners that she will be a distinct
acquisition to the parsonage We can put on lots more style of course
And then it was awfully nice of her to send so much of her good
furniturethe piano for instance to take the place of that old tin
pan of ours
Carol smiled a little If she had written Dear John I cant by any
means live in a house with furniture like that of yours so youll have
to let me bring some of my ownwouldnt we have been furious That
was what she meant all right but she put it very neatly
Yes I love some of my things so dearly Lark quoted promptly and
have lived with them so long that I am too selfish to part with them
May I bring a few pieces along Yes it was pretty cute of her
And do remember girls that you mustnt ask her to darn your
stockings and wash your handkerchiefs and do your tasks about the
house It would be disgraceful And be careful not to hint for things
you want for of course Aunt Grace will trot off and buy them for you
and papa will not like it You twinsll have to be very careful to quit
dreaming about silk stockings for instance There was a tinge of
sarcasm in Fairys voice as she said this
Fairy we did dream about silk stockingsyou dont need to believe it
if you dont want to But we did dream about them just the same Carol
sighed I think I could be more reconciled to Aunt Grace if I thought
shed give me a pair of silk stockings You know Fairy sometimes
lately I almostdont like Aunt Graceany more
Thats very foolish and very wicked declared Fairy I love her
dearly Im so glad shes come to live with us
Are you asked Connie innocently Then why did you go up in the attic
and cry all morning when Prudence was fixing the room for her
Fairy blushed and caught her under lip between her teeth for a minute
And then in a changed voice she said II do love her andI am
gladbut I keep thinking ahead to when Prudence gets married
andandoh girls Prudence was all settled in the parsonage when I
was born and shes been here ever since andwhen she is gone itit
wont be any home to me at all
Her voice rose on the last words in a way most pitifully suggestive of
tears
For a moment there was a stricken silence
Oh pooh Carol said at last bravely You wouldnt want Prue to
stick around and be an old maid would you I think shes mighty lucky
to get a fellow as nice as Jerry Harmer myself Ill bet you dont make
out half as well Fairy I think shed be awfully silly not to gobble
him right up while she has a chance For my own part I dont believe
in old maids I think it is a religious duty for folks to get married
andandyou know what I meanrace suicide you know She nodded her
head sagely winking one eye in a most intelligent fashion
And Aunt Grace is so quiet shell not be any bother at all added
Lark Dont you remember how she always sits around and smiles at us
and never says anything She wont scold a bitMaybe Carol and I will
get a chance to spend some of our spending money when she takes charge
Prudence confiscates it all for punishment I think its going to be
lots of fun having Aunt Grace with us
Im going to take my dime and buy her something Connie announced
suddenly
The twins whirled on her sharply Your dime echoed Carol
I didnt know you had a dime said Lark
Connie flushed a little YesOh yes she said Ive got a dime
II hid it Ive got a dime all right
Its nearly time said Fairy restlessly Number Nine has been on
time for two mornings nowso shell probably be here in time for
dinner Its only ten oclock now
You mean luncheon suggested Carol
Yes luncheon to be sure fair sister
Whered you get that dime Connie
Oh Ive had it some time Connie admitted reluctantly
When I asked you to lend me a dime you said
You asked me if I had a dime I could lend you and I said No and I
didnt for I didnt have this dime to lend
But where have you had it inquired Lark I thought you acted
suspicious some way so I went around and looked for myself
Where did you look
The twins laughed gleefully Oh on top of the windows and doors said
Carol
How did you know began Connie
You arent slick enough for us Connie We knew you had some funny
place to hide your money so I gave you that penny and then I went
upstairs very noisily so you could hear me and Lark sneaked around
and watched and saw where you put it Weve been able to keep pretty
good track of your finances lately
The twins laughed again
But I looked on the top ledge of all the windows and doors just
yesterday admitted Lark and there was nothing there Did you put
that dime in the bank
Oh never mind said Connie I dont need to tell you You twins are
too slick for me you know
The twins looked slightly fussed especially when Fairy laughed with a
merry Good for you Connie
Carol rose and looked at herself in the glass Im going upstairs
she said
What for inquired Lark rising also
I need a little more powder My nose is shiny
So the twins went upstairs and Fairy after calling out to them to be
very careful and not get disheveled went out into the yard and wandered
dolefully about by herself
Connie meantime decided to get her wellhidden dime and figure out what
ten cents could buy for her fastidious and wealthy aunt Connie was in
many ways unique Her system of moneyhiding was born of nothing less
than genius prompted by necessity for the twins were clever as well as
grasping She did not know they had discovered her plan of banking on
the top ledge of the windows and doors but having dealt with them long
and bitterly she knew that in money matters she must give them the
benefit of all her ingenuity For the last and precious dime she had
discovered a brandnew hidingplace
The cook stove sat in the darkest and most remote corner of the kitchen
and where the chimney fitted into the wall it was protected by a small
zinc plate This zinc plate protruded barely an inch but that inch was
quite sufficient for coins the size of Connies and there high and
secure in the shadowy corner lay Connies dime Now that she had
decided to spend it she wanted it before her eyesfor ten cents in
sight buys much more than ten cents in memory She went into the kitchen
cautiously careful of her white canvas shoes and put a chair beside
the stove She had discovered that the dishpan turned upside down on the
chair gave her sufficient height to reach her novel banking place
The preparation was soon accomplished and neatly for Connie was an
orderly child and loved cleanliness even on occasions less demanding
than this
But alas for Connies calculationsCarol was born for higher things
than dish washing and she had splashed soapsuds on the table The pan
had been set among themand then neatly wiped on the inside it had
been hung up behind the tablewith the suds on the bottom And it was
upon this same dishpan that Connie climbed so carefully in search of her
darling dime
The result was certain As she slowly and breathlessly raised herself on
tiptoe steadying herself with the tips of her fingers lightly touching
the stovepipe her foot moved treacherously into the soapy area and
slipped Connie screamed caught desperately at the pipe and fell to
the floor in a sickening jumble of stovepipe dishpan and soot beyond
her wildest fancies Her cries brought her sisters flying and the sight
of the blackened kitchen and the unfortunate child in the midst of
disaster banished from their minds all memory of the coming chaperon
of Prudences warning wordsConnie was in trouble With sisterly
affection they rescued her and did not hear the ringing of the bell
They brushed her they shook her they kissed her they all but wept
over her And when Prudence and her father with Aunt Grace in tow
despaired of gaining entrance at the hands of the girls came in
unannounced it was a sorry scene that greeted them Fairy and the twins
were only less sooty than Connie and the kitchen The stovepipe lay
about them with that insufferable insolence known only to fallen
stovepipe And Connie wept loudly her tears making hideous trails upon
her blackened face
I might have known it Prudence thought with sorrow But her motherly
pride vanished before her motherly solicitude and Connie was soon
quieted by her tender ministrations
Illustration We love you but we cant kiss you
We love you Aunt Grace cried Carol earnestly but we cant kiss
you
Mr Starr anxiously scanned the surface of the kitchen table with an eye
to future spots on the new suit and then sat down on the edge of it
and laughed as only a man of young heart and old experience can laugh
Disgraced again he said Prudence said we made a mistake in not
taking you all to the station where we could watch you every minute
Grace think well before you take the plunge Do you dare cast in your
fortunes with a parsonage bunch that revels in misfortune Can you take
the responsibility of rearing a family that knows trouble only This is
your last chance Weigh well your words
The twins squirmed uncomfortably True she was their aunt and knew
many things about them But they did think it was almost bad form for
their father to emphasize their failings in the presence of any one
outside the family
Fairy pursed up her lips puffing vainly at the soot that had settled
upon her face Then she laughed Very true Aunt Grace she said We
admit that were a luckless family But were expecting with you to
help us to do much better You see weve never had half a chance so
far with only father behind us
The twins revived at this and joined in the laughter their father led
against himself
Later in the day Prudence drew her aunt to one side and asked softly
Was it much of a shock to you Aunt Grace The family drowned in soot
to welcome you Im sure you expected to find everything trim and fresh
and orderly Was it a bitter disappointment
Aunt Grace smiled brightly Why no Prudence she said in her slow
even voice I really expected something to be wrong Id have been
disappointed if everything had gone just right
CHAPTER II
SCIENCE AND HEALTH
After all the advent of a chaperon made surprisingly little difference
in the life of the parsonage family but what change there was was all
to the good Their aunt assumed no active directorate over household
matters She just slipped in happily unobtrusively helpfully She was
a gentle woman smiling much saying little Indeed her untalkativeness
soon became a matter of great merriment among the lively girls
A splendid deaf and dumb person was lost to the world in you Aunt
Grace Carol assured her warmly I never saw a woman who could say so
much in smiles and be so expressive without words
Fairy said She carries on a prolonged discussion and argues and
orates without saying a word
The members of the Ladies Aid who hastened to call said She is
perfectly charmingsuch a fine conversationalist
She was always attractively dressed always selfpossessed always
friendly always goodnatured and the girls found her presence only
pleasing She relieved Prudence admired Fairy laughed at the twins
adored Connie Between her and Mr Starr there was a frank camaraderie
charming but seldom found between brothers and sistersinlaw
Of course Aunt Grace Prudence told her sweetly we arent going to
be selfish with you We dont expect you to bury yourself in the
parsonage Whenever you want to trip away for a while you must feel
free to go We dont intend to monopolize you however much we want to
do so Whenever you want to go you must go
I shant want to go said Aunt Grace quickly
Not right away of course Prudence agreed But youll find our
liveliness tiring Whenever you do want to go
I dont think I shall want to go at all she answered I like it
here II like liveliness
Then Prudence kissed her gratefully
For several weeks after her initiation in the parsonage life rolled
along sweetly and serenely There were only the minor unavoidable
mishaps and disciplinary measures common to the life of any family Of
course there were frequent stirring verbal skirmishes between Fairy
and the twins and between the twins and Connie But these did not
disturb their aunt She leaned back in her chair or among the cushions
listening gravely but with eyes that always smiled
Then came a curious lull
For ten entire and successive days the twins had lived blameless lives
Their voices rang out gladly and sweetly They treated Connie with a
sisterly tenderness and gentleness quite out of accord with their usual
drastic discipline They obeyed the word of Prudence with a cheerful
readiness that was startlingly cherubimic The most distasteful of
orders called forth nothing stronger than a bright Yes Prudence
They no longer developed dangerous symptoms of physical disablement at
times of unpleasant duties Their devotion to the cause of health was
beautiful Not an ache disturbed them Not a pain suggested a
substitute
Prudence watched them with painful solicitude Her years of mothering
had given her an almost supernatural intuition as to causes and
effects
On Wednesday morning Mr Starr bade his family goodby and set out on a
tour of Epworth League conventions He was to be away from home until
the end of the following week A prospective Presbyterian theologian had
been selected from the college to fill his pulpit on the Sabbath and
the girls with their aunt faced an unusually long period of running
the parsonage to suit themselves
At ten oclock the train carried their father off in the direction of
Burlington and at eleven oclock the twins returned to the parsonage
They had given him a daughterly sendoff at the station and then gone
to the library for books Prudence Fairy and Aunt Grace sat sewing on
the side porch as they cut across the parsonage lawn their feet
crinkling pleasantly through the drift of autumn leaves the wind had
piled beneath the trees
Were out of potatoes twins said Prudence as they drew near
Youll have to dig some before dinner
For one instant their complacent features clouded Prudence looked up
expectantly sure of a break in their serene placidity
One doubtful second then
Certainly Prudence said Carol brightly
And Lark added genially Wed better fill the box I guessso well
have enough for the rest of the week
And singing a light but unharmonic snatch of song the twins went in
search of basket and hoe
The twins were not musical They only sang from principle to emphasize
their lightheartedness when it needed special impressing
Prudences brows knitted in anxious frowns and she sighed a few times
What is the matter Prue You look like a rainy Christmas said Fairy
Its the twins was the mournful answer
The twins ejaculated Fairy Why theyve acted like angels lately
Even Aunt Grace lifted mildly inquiring eyebrows
Thats itThats just it When the twins act like angels I get
uneasy right away The better they act the more suspicious I feel
What have they been doing
Nothing Not a thing Thats why Im worried It must be something
terrible
Fairy laughed and returned to her embroidery Aunt Grace smiled and
began plying her needles once more But Prudence still looked troubled
and sighed often
There was no apparent ground for her alarm The twins came back with the
potatoes peeled some for luncheon and set the table their faces still
bright and smiling Prudences eyes often fastened upon their angelic
countenances grew more and more troubled
In the afternoon they joined the little circle on the porch but not to
sew They took a book and lay down on a rug with the book before them
reading together Evidently they were all absorbed An hour passed two
hours three At times Carol pointed to a line and said in a low voice
Thats good isnt it And Lark would answer DandyHave you read
this
Prudence in spite of her devotion to the embroidering of large Ss on
assorted pieces of linen never forgot the twins for a moment
What are you reading she asked at last aimlessly her only desire to
be reassured by the sound of their voices
There was an almost imperceptible pause Then Carol answeredher chin
was in her palms which may have accounted for the mumbling of the words
Scianceanelth
What
Another pause a little more perceptible this time Science and
Health Carol said at last quite distinctly
Science and Health Prudence repeated in a puzzled tone Is it a
doctor book
Whysomething of the sortyes said Carol dubiously
Science and Health Science and Health mused Fairy You dont
mean that Christian Science book do you You know what I mean
PrudenceMary Baker Eddys bookScience and Healththats the name
of it Thats not what you twins are devouring so ravenously is it
Carol answered with manifest reluctance glancing nervously at
Prudence Yyesthats what it is
Ominous silence greeted this admission A slow red flush mantled the
twins cheeks Aunt Graces eyes twinkled a little although her face
was grave Fairy looked surprised Prudence looked dumfounded When she
spoke her words gave no sign of the cataclysmic struggle through which
she had passed
What are you reading that for
Whyits very interesting explained Lark coming to Carols rescue
Carol was very good at meeting investigation but when it came to
prolonged explanation Lark stood preeminent Of course we dont
believe ityet But there are some good things in it Part of it is
very beautiful We dont just understand itits very deep But some
of the ideas are very fine anderuplifting you know
Prudence looked most miserable Buttwins do you thinkministers
daughters ought to readthings like that
Why Prudence I think ministers daughters ought to be wellinformed
on every subject declared Lark conscientiously How can we be an
influence if we dont know anything about thingsAnd I tell you what
it is Prue I dont think its right for all of us church people to
stand back and knock Christian Science when we dont know anything about
it Its narrowminded thats what it is Its downright unChristian
When you get into the book you will find it just full of fine inspiring
thoughtssomething like the Bibleonlyerand very good you know
Prudence looked at Fairy and her aunt in helpless dismay This was
something entirely new in her experience of rearing a family
II dont think you ought to read it she said slowly But at the
same time
Of course if you command us not to read it we wont said Carol
generously
Yes Weve already learned quite a lot about it amended Lark with
something of warning in her tone
What do you think about it Aunt Grace
WhyI dont know Prudence You know more about rearing twins than I
do
Prudence at that moment felt that she knew very little about it
indeed She turned to Fairy There was a strange intentness in Fairys
fine eyes as she studied the twins on the floor at her feet
You arent thinking of turning Christian Scientists yourselves are
you asked Prudence rather humbly
Oh of course we arent Scientists Prudence was the quick denial
We dont know anything about it yet really But there are lots of very
helpful things in it andpeople talk about it so much andthey have
made such wonderful cures you know andwed thought wed just study
up a little
You take the book and read it yourself Prue urged Carol hospitably
Youll see what we mean
Prudence drew back quickly as though the book would sear her fingers
She looked very forlorn She realized that it would be bad policy to
forbid the twins to read it On the other hand she realized equally
strongly that it was certainly unwise to allow its doctrines to take
root in the minds of parsonage daughters If only her father were at
hometen days between herself and the lifting of responsibility
When father comes home she began And then suddenly Fairy spoke
I think the twins are right she said emphatically and the twins
looked at her with a surprised anxiety that mated Prudences own It
would be very narrowminded of us to refuse to look into a subject as
important as this Let them go on and study it we can decide things
later
Prudence looked very doubtful but a warning movement of Fairys left
eyelashthe side removed from the twinscomforted her
Well she said
Of course Prudence we know it would nearly break fathers heart for
us to go back on our own churchbut dont you think if folks become
truly convinced that Christian Science is the true and good religion
they ought to stand by it and sufferjust like the martyrs of old
suggested Larkand the suggestion brought the doubtclouds thick about
Prudences head once more
We may not be convinced of course added Carol but there is
something ratherassuringabout it
