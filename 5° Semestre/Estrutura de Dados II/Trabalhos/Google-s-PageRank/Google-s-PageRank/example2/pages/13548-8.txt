INTRODUCTION
In times of anxiety and discontent when discontent has engendered the
belief that great and widespread economic and social changes are
needed there is a risk that men or States may act hastily rushing to
new schemes which seem promising chiefly because they are new
catching at expedients that have a superficial air of practicality
and forgetting the general theory upon which practical plans should be
based At such moments there is special need for the restatement and
enforcement by argument of sound principles To such principles so far
as they relate to education it is the aim of these essays to recall
the public mind They cover so many branches of educational theory and
deal with them so fully and clearly being the work of skilled and
vigorous thinkers that it would be idle for me to enter in a short
introduction upon those topics which they have discussed with special
knowledge far greater than I possess All I shall attempt is to
present a few scattered observations on the general problems of
education as they stand today
The largest of those problems viz how to provide elementary
instruction for the whole population is far less urgent now than it
was fifty years ago The Act of 1870 followed by the Act which made
schoolattendance compulsory has done its work What is wanted now
is Quality rather than Quantity Quantity is doubtless needed in one
respect Children ought to stay longer at school and ought to have
more encouragement to continue education after they leave the
elementary school But it is chiefly an improvement in the teaching
that is wanted and that of course means the securing of higher
competence in the teacher by raising the remuneration and the status
of the teaching profession1
The next problem is how to find the finest minds among the children of
the country and bring them by adequate training to the highest
efficiency The sifting out of these best minds is a matter of
educational organisation and machinery and the process will become
the easier when the elementary teachers who ought to bear a part in
selecting those who are most fitted to be sent on to secondary
schools have themselves become better qualified for the task of
discrimination The question how to train these best minds when sifted
out would lead me into the tangled controversy as to the respective
educational values of various subjects of instruction a topic which I
must not deal with here What I do wish to dwell upon is the supreme
importance to the progress of a nation of the best talent it
possesses In every country there is a certain percentage of the
population who are fitted by their superior intelligence industry
and force of character to be the leaders in every branch of action
and thought It is a small percentage but it may be increased by
discovering ability in places where the conditions do not favour its
development and setting it where it will have a better chance of
growth just as a seedling tree brought out of the dry shade may shoot
up when planted where sun and rain can reach it freely I am not
thinking of those exceptionally great and powerful minds of whom
there may not be more than four or five in a generation who make
brilliant discoveries or change the currents of thought but rather of
persons of a capacity high if not quite first rate which enables
them granted fair chances to rise quickly into positions where they
can effectively serve the community These men whatever occupation
they follow be it that of abstract thinking or literary production
or scientific research or the conduct of affairs whether commercial
or political or administrative are the dynamic strength of the
country when they enter manhood and its realised wealth when they are
in their fullest vigour thirty years later We need more of them and
more of them may be found by taking pains
The volume of thought continuously applied to the work of life
whether it be applied in the library or study or laboratory or in the
workshop or factory or countinghouse or council chamber has not been
keeping pace with the growth of our population our wealth our
responsibilities It is not today sufficient for the increasing
vastness and complexity of the problems that confront a great nation
We in Great Britain have been too apt to rely upon our energy and
courage and practical resourcefulness in emergencies and thus have
tended to neglect those efforts to accumulate knowledge and consider
how it can be most usefully applied which should precede and
accompany action This deficiency is happily one that can be removed
while a want of qualities which are the gift of nature is less
curable The efficiency which is on every ones mouth cannot be
extemporised by rushing hastily into action however energetic It is
the fruit of patient and exact determination of and reflection upon
the facts to be dealt with
The view that it was the finest minds that ought to be most cared for
and that to them of right belonged not merely leadership but even
control also was carried by the ancients and especially by Plato and
Aristotle almost to excess Their ideal and indeed that of most
Greek thinkers was the maintenance among the masses of the military
valour and discipline which the State needed for its protection and
the cultivation among the chosen few of the highest intellectual and
moral excellence In the Middle Ages when power as well as rank
belonged to two classes nobles and clergy the ideal of education
took a religious colour and that training was most valued which made
men loyal to the Church and to sound doctrine with the prospect of
bliss in the world to come In our times educational ideals have
become not merely more earthly but more material Modern doctrines of
equality have discredited the ancient view that the chief aim of
instruction is to prepare the few Wise and Good for the government of
the State It is not merely upon this world but also upon the material
things of this world power and the acquisition of territory
industrial production commerce finance wealth and prosperity in all
its forms that the modern eye is fixed There has been a drifting
away from that respect for learning which was strong in the Middle
Ages and lasted down into the eighteenth century In some countries
as in our own that which instruction and training may accomplish has
been rated far below the standard of the ancients Yet in our own time
we have seen two striking examples to show that their estimate was
hardly too high Think of the power which the constant holding up
during long centuries of certain ideals and standards of conduct
exerted upon the Japanese people instilling sentiments of loyalty to
the sovereign and inspiring a certain conception of chivalric duty
which Europe did not reach even when monarchy and chivalry stood
highest Think of that boundless devotion to the State as an
omnipotent and allabsorbing power superseding morality and
suppressing the individual which within the short span of two
generations has taken possession of Germany In the latter case at
least the incessant preaching and teaching of a theory which lowers
the citizens independence and individuality while it saps his moral
sense seems to us a misdirection of educational effort But in it
education has at least displayed its power
Can a fair statement of the educational ideals which we might here and
now set before ourselves be found in saying that there are three
chief aims to be sought as respects those we have called the best
minds
One aim is to fit men to be at least explorers even if not
discoverers in the fields of science and learning
A second is to fit them to be leaders in the field of action leaders
not only by their initiative and their diligence but also by the
power and the habit of turning a full stream of thought and knowledge
upon whatever work they have to do
A third is to give them the taste for and the habit of enjoying
intellectual pleasures
Many moralists ancient and modern have given pleasure a bad name
because they saw that the most alluring and powerfully seductive
pleasures pleasures which appeal to all men alike were indulged to
excess and became a source of evil But men will have pleasure and
ought to have pleasure The best way of drawing them off from the more
dangerous pleasures is to teach them to enjoy the better kinds
Moreover the quieter pleasures of the intellect mean Rest and a
greater fitness for resuming work
The pity is that so many sources capable of affording delight are
ignored or imperfectly appreciated May not this be partly the fault
of the lines which our education has followed Perhaps some kinds of
study would have fared better if their defenders had dwelt more upon
the pleasure they afford and less upon their supposed utility The
champions of Greek and Latin have dilated on the value of grammar as a
mental discipline and argued that the best way to acquire a good
English style is to know the ancient languages a proposition
discredited by many examples to the contrary It is really this
insistence on grammatical minutiae that has proved repellent to young
people and suggested the dictum that it doesnt much matter what you
teach a boy so long as he hates it Better had it been abandoning
the notion that every one should learn Greek to dwell upon the
boundless pleasure which minds of imagination and literary taste
derive from carrying in memory the gems of ancient wisdom which are
more easily remembered because they are not in our own language and
the finest passages of ancient poetry There are plenty of
thingsindeed there are far more thingsin modern literature as
noble and as beautiful as the best of the ancients can give us But
they are not the same things The ancient poets have the freshness and
the fragrance of the springtime of the world 2 Or take another sort
of instance Take the pleasures which nature spreads before us with a
generous hand hills and fields and woods and rocks flowers and the
songs of birds the evershifting aspects of clouds and of landscapes
under light and shadow How few persons in most countriesfor there
is in this respect a difference between different peoplesnotice
these things Everybody sees them few observe them or derive pleasure
from them Is not this largely because attention has not been properly
called to them They have not been taught to look at natural objects
closely and see the variety there is in them Persons in whom no taste
for pictures has ever been formed by their having been taken to see
good pictures and told what constitutes merit are when led into a
picture gallery usually interested in the subjects They like to see
a sportsman shooting wild fowl or a battle scene or even a prize
fight or a mother tending a sick child because these incidents
appeal to them But they seldom see in a picture anything but the
subject they do not appreciate imaginative quality or composition
or colour or light and shade or indeed anything except exact
imitation of the actual So in nature the average man is struck by
something so exceptional as a lofty rock like Ailsa Craig or the
Needles off the Isle of Wight or an eclipse of the moon or perhaps a
bloodred sunset but he does not notice and consequently draws no
pleasure from landscapes in general whether noble or quietly
beautiful The capacity for taking pleasure in all these things may
not be absent There is reason to think that most children possess
it because when they are shown how to observe they usually respond
quickly perceiving for instance the differences between one flower
and another quickly even when quite young learning the distinctive
characters and names of each enjoying the process of recognising
each when they walk along the lanes as indeed every intelligent
child enjoys the exercise of its observing powers The disproportionate
growth of our urban population a thing regrettable in other respects
also has no doubt made it more difficult to give young people a
familiar knowledge of nature but the facilities for going into the
country and the happy lengthening of summer holidays render it easier
than formerly to provide opportunities for Nature Study which
properly conducted is a recreation and not a lesson There is no
source of enjoyment which lasts so keen all through life or which fits
one better for other enjoyments such as those of art and of travel
Of the value of the habit of alert observation for other purposes I
say nothing wishing here to insist only upon what it may do for
delight
It is often alleged that in England boys and girls show less mental
curiosity less desire for knowledge than those of most European
countries or even than those of the three smaller countries north and
west of England in which the Celtic element is stronger than it is in
South Britain A parallel charge has ever since the days of Matthew
Arnold been brought against the English upper and middle classes He
declared that they care less for the things of the mind and show
less respect to eminence in science literature and art than is the
case elsewhere as for instance in France Germany or Italy to which
one may add the United States and he thus explained the scanty
interest taken by these classes in educational progress
Should this latter charge be well founded the fact it notes would
tend to perpetuate the former evil for the indifference of parents
reacts upon the school and upon the pupils The love of knowledge is
so natural and awakens so early in the normal child that even if it
be somewhat less keen among English than among French or Scottish
children we may well believe our deficiencies to be largely due to
faulty and unstimulative methods of teaching and may trust that they
will diminish when these methods have been improved
If it be true that the English public generally show a want of
interest in and faint appreciation of the value of education the
stern discipline of war will do something to remove this indifference
The comparative poverty and reduction of luxurious habits which this
war will bring in its train along with a sense of the need that has
arisen for turning to the fullest account all the intellectual
resources of the country so that it may maintain its place in the
worldthese things may be expected to work a change for the better
and lead parents to set more store upon the mental and less upon the
athletic achievements of their sons
Be this as it may no one today denies that much remains to be done
to spread a sense of the value of science for those branches of
industry to which as especially to agriculture it has been
imperfectly applied to strengthen and develop the teaching of
scientific theory as the foundation of technical and practical
scientific work and above all to equip with the largest measure of
knowledge and by the most stimulating training those on whom nature
has bestowed the most vigorous and flexible minds Today e see that
the heads of great businesses industrial and financial are looking
out for men of university distinction to be placed in responsible
postsa thing which did not happen fifty years agobecause the
conditions of modern business have grown too intricate to be handled
by any but the best trained brains The same need is at least equally
true of many branches of that administrative work which is now being
thrust in growing volume upon the State and its officials
If we feel this as respects the internal economic life of our country
is it not true also of the international life of the world In the
stress and competition of our times the future belongs to the nations
that recognise the worth of Knowledge and Thought and best understand
how to apply the accumulated experience of the past In the long run
it is knowledge and wisdom that rule the world not knowledge only
but knowledge applied with that width of view and sympathetic
comprehension of men and of other nations which are the essence of
statesmanship
Footnote 1 This has been clearly seen and admirably stated by the
present President of the Board of Education
Footnote 2 Take for instance this little fragment of Alcman
Greek Ou m heti parthenikai meligaryest imerophonoi
Gyia pherein dynatai Bale de Bale kerylos eien
Hos t hepi kymatos hanthos ham alkyonessi potetai
Neleges hetor hechon haliporphyros eiaros hornis
What can be more exquisite than the epithets in the first line or
more fresh and delicate and tender in imaginative quality than the
three last A modern poet of equal genius would treat the topic with
equal force and grace but the charm the untranslatable charm of
antique simplicity would be absent
I
THE AIM OF EDUCATIONAL REFORM
By J L PATON
High Master of Manchester Grammar School
The last century with all its brilliant achievement in scientific
discovery and increase of production was spiritually a failure The
sadness of that spiritual failure crushed the heart of Clough turned
Carlyle from a thinker into a scold and Matthew Arnold from a poet
into a writer of prose
The secret of failure was that the great forces which move mankind
were out of touch with each other and furnished no mutual support
Art had no vital relation with industry work was dissociated from
joy political economy was at issue with humanity science was at
daggers drawn with religion action did not correspond to thought
being to seeming and finally the individual was conceived as having
claims and interests at variance with the claims and interests of the
society of which he formed a part in fact as standing out against it
in an opposition so sharply marked that one of the greatest thinkers
could write a book with the title Man versus the State As a
result nation was divided against nation labour against capital
town against country sex against sex the hearts of the children
were set against the fathers the Church fought against the State
and worst of all Church fought against Church
The discords of the great society were reflect inevitably in the
sphere of education The elementary schools of the nation were divided
into two conflicting groups and both were separated by an estranging
gulf from the grammar schools and high schools as the grammar schools
in turn were shut off from the public schools on the one hand and
from the schools of art music and of technology on the other There
was no cohesion no concerted effort no mutual support no great plan
of advance no homologating idea
This fact in itself is sufficient to account for the ineffectiveness
the despondencies the insincerities and ceaseless unrest of Western
civilisation in the nineteenth century The tree of human life cannot
flower and bear fruit for the healing of the nations when its great
lifeforces spend themselves in making war on each other
If the experience of the century which lies before us is to be
different it must be made so by means of education Education is the
science which deals with the world as it is capable of becoming Other
sciences deal with things as they are and formulate the laws which
they find to prevail in things as they are The eyes of education are
fixed always upon the future and philosophy of whatever kind
directly adumbrates a Utopia thinks on educational lines
The aim of education must therefore be as wide as it is high it must
be coextensive with life The advance must be along the whole front
not on a small sector only William Morris when he tried his hand at
painting used to say that what bothered him always was the frame he
could not conceive of art as something framed off and isolated from
life Just as William Morris wanted to turn all life into art so with
education It cannot be framed off and detached from the larger
aspects of political and social wellbeing it takes all life for its
province It is not an end in itself any more than the individuals
with whom it deals it acts upon the individual but through the
individual it acts upon the mass and its aim is nothing less than the
right ordering of human society
To cope with a task which can be stated in these terms education must
be free A new age postulates a new education The traditions which
have dominated hitherto must one by one be challenged to render
account of themselves that which is good in them must be conserved
and assimilated that which is effete must be scrapped and rejected
Neither can the administrative machinery as it exists be taken for
granted unless it shows those powers of adaptation and growth which
show it to be alive and not dead it too must be scrapped and
rejected new wine is fatal to old skins Education must regain once
more what she possessed at the time of the Renascencethe power of
direction she must be mistress of her fate
Further if education is to be a force which makes for cooperation
in place of conflict she must not be divided against herself She
must leave behind forever the separations and snobberies the
misunderstandings the wordy battles beloved of pedants and
politicians The smoke and dust of controversy obscures her vision
and she needs all her energies to tackle the great task which
confronts her In this regard nothing is so full of promise for the
future as the new sense of unity which is beginning both to animate
and actuate the whole teaching profession from the University to the
Kindergarten and has already eventuated in the formation of a
Teachers Registration Council on which all sorts and conditions of
education are represented
The materialists have not been slow to see their chance to challenge
the old tradition of literary education and to urge the claims of
science But the aim which they place before us is frankly statedit
is the acquisition of wealth they are on manna bent and mortal
ends and their conception of the future is a world in which one
nation competes against another for the acquisition of markets and
commodities In effect therefore materialism challenges the
classics but it accepts the selfseeking ideals of the past
generations and accepts also as an integral part of the future the
scramble of conflicting interests labour against capital nation
against nation man against man Now the first characteristic of the
genuine scientific mind is the power of learning by experience Real
science never makes the same mistake twice Obviously the repetition
of the past can only eventuate in the repetition of the present And
that is precisely what education sets itself to counteract The
materialist forgets three outstanding and obvious facts Firstly
science cannot be the whole of knowledge because science in his
limited sense of the term deals only with what appears Secondly
power of insight depends not so much upon the senses as on moral
qualities the sense of sympathy and of fairness it needs
selfdiscipline as well as knowledge both of oneself and ones
fellowman How can a man says Carlyle without clear vision in
his heart first of all have any clear vision in the head Eyes and
ears said the ancient philosopher are bad witnesses for such as
have barbarian souls Thirdly the tragedy of the past generation was
not its failure to accumulate wealth in that respect it was more
successful than any generation which preceded it The tragedy of the
nineteenth century was that when it had acquired wealth it had no
clear idea either individually or collectively what to do with it
And yet the house of humanity faces both ways it looks out towards
the world of appearances as well as to the world of spirit and is in
fact the meetingplace of both Materialism is not wrong because it
deals with material things It is wrong because it deals with nothing
else It is wrong also in education because taking the point of view
of the adult it makes the material product itself the allimportant
thing In every right conception of education the child is central
The child is interested in things It wants first to sense them or
as Froebel would say to make the outer inner it wants to play with
them to construct with them and along the line of this inward
propulsion the educational process has to act The thingstudies if
one may so term them which have been introduced into the curriculum
such as gardening manual training with cardboard wood metal
cooking painting modelling games and dramatisation are it is true
later introductions adopted mainly from utilitarian motive and they
have been ingrafted on the original trunk being at first regarded as
detachable extras but they quickly showed that they were an organic
part of the real educative process they have already reacted on the
other subjects of the curriculum and have in the earlier stages of
education become central In the same way vocation is having great
influence upon the higher terminal stages of education All this is
part of the most important of all correlations the correlation of
school with life
But the childs interest in things is social Through the primitive
occupations of mankind he is entering step by step into the heritage
of the race and into a richer fuller personal experience The science
which enlists a childs interest is not that which is presented from
the logical abstract point of view The way in which the child
acquires it is the same as that in which mankind acquired ithis
occupation presents certain difficulties to overcome these
difficulties he has to exercise his thought he invents and
experiments and so thought reacts upon occupation occupation reacts
upon thought And out of that reciprocal action science is born In
the same way his play is socialin his games too he enters into the
heritage of the race and in playing them he is learning unconsciously
the greatest of all arts the art of living with others In his play
as well as in his school work the lines of his natural development
show how he can be trained to cooperate with the law of human
progress
This fitness and readiness to cooperate with the great movement of
human progress allround fitness of body mind and spirit provides
the formula which fuses and reconciles two growing tendencies in
modern education
There is in the first place the movement towards selfexpression and
selfdevelopmentpostulating for the scholar a larger measure of
liberty in thought and action and selfdirection than hithertothis
movement is represented mainly by Dr Montessori and by What is and
what might be it is a movement which is spreading upwards from the
infant school to the higher standards Side by side with it is the
movement towards the fuller development of corporate life in the
school the movement which trains the child to put the school first in
his thoughts to live for the society to which he belongs and find his
own personal wellbeing in the wellbeing of that society This has
been ever since Arnold sedulously fostered in the games of the
public schools and fruitful of good results in that limited sphere
it has been applied with conspicuous success to the development of
selfgovernment and it has reached its fullest expression in the
little Commonwealth of Mr Homer Lane But we are beginning to
recognise its wider applications it is capable of transforming the
spirit of the classroom activities as well as the activities of a
playing field it is in every way as applicable to the elementary
school as to Eton or Rugby or Harrow and to girls as well as to
boys
These two movements towards a fuller liberty of selffulfilment and
towards a fuller and stronger social life are convergent and
supplement or rather complement each other Personality after all
is best defined as capacity for fellowship and only in the social
milieu can the individual find his real selffulfilling Unless he
functions socially the individual develops into eccentricity
negative criticism and the cynical aloofness of the superior
person On the other hand without freedom of individual development
the organisation of life becomes the death of the soul Prussia has
shown how the psychology of the crowd can be skilfully manipulated for
the most sinister ends It is a happy omen for our democracy that both
these complementary movements are combined in the new life of the
schools To both appeals the appeal of personal freedom and the
appeal of the corporate life the British child is peculiarly
responsive Round these two healthcentres the form of the new system
