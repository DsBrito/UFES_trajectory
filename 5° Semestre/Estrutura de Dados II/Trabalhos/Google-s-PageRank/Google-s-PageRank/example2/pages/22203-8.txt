interested or overenthusiastic people
MY CONTEMPORARIES IN FICTION
IFIRST THE CRITICS AND THEN A WORD ON DICKENS
The critics of today are suffering from a sort of epidemic of kindness
They have accustomed themselves to the administration of praise in
unmeasured doses They are not taking them in the mass critics any
longer but merely professional admirers They have ceased to be useful
to the public and are becoming dangerous to the interests of letters
In their overfriendly eyes every painstaking apprentice in the art of
fiction is a master and hysterical schoolgirls who have spent their
brief day in the acquisition of ignorance are reviewed as if they were
so many Elizabeth Barrett Brownings or George Eliots One of the most
curious and instructive things in this regard is the use which the
modern critic makes of Sir Walter Scott Sir Walter is set up as a sort
of first standard for the aspirant in the art of fiction to excel Let
the question be asked with as much gravity as is possible What is
the use of a critic who gravely assures us that Mr S R Crockett has
rivalled if not surpassed Sir Walter The statement is of course
most lamentably and ludicrously absurd but it is made more than once
or twice or thrice and it is quoted and advertised It is not Mr
Crocketts fault that he is set on this ridiculous eminence and
his name is not cited here with any grain of malice He has his
fellowsufferers Other gentlemen who have rivalled if not surpassed
Sir Walter are Dr Conan Doyle Mr J M Barrie Mr Ian Maclaren
and Mr Stanley Weyman No person whose judgment is worth a straw can
read the writings of these accomplished workmen without respect and
pleasure But it is no more true that they rival Sir Walter than it is
true that they are twelve feet high or that any one of them believes in
his own private mind the egregious announcement of the reviewer The one
great sufferer by this craze for setting men of middling stature side
by side with Scott is our beautiful and beloved Stevenson who unless
rescued by some judicious hand is likely to be buried under foolish and
unmeasured praises
It would be easy to fill pages with verifications of the charge here
made Books of the last halfdozen years or so which have already
proved the ephemeral nature of their own claim have been received with
plaudits which would have been exaggerated if applied to some of our
acknowledged classics The critical declaration that Eric Brighteyes
could have been written by no other Englishman of the last six hundred
years than Mr Rider Haggard may be allowed its own monumental place in
the desert of silly and hysteric judgments
It is time for the sake of mere commonsense to get back to something
like a real standard of excellence It is time to say plainly that our
literature is in danger of degradation and that the mass of readers is
systematically misled
Before I go further I will offer one word in selfexcuse I have taken
this work upon my own shoulders because I cannot see that anybody else
will take it and because it seems to me to be calling loudly to be
done My one unwillingness to undertake it lies in the fact that I have
devoted my own life to the pursuit of that art the exercise of which
by my contemporaries I am now about to criticise That has an evil and
ungenerous look But whatever the declaration may seem to be worth I
make it with sincerity and truth I have never tasted the gall of envy
in my life I have had my share and my full share of the critical
sugarplums I have never in the critics apprehension rivalled
or surpassed Sir Walter but on many thousands of printed pages
of advertisement it is recorded that I have more genius for the
delineation of rustic character than any halfdozen surviving novelists
put together I laugh when I read this for I remember Thomas Hardy
who is my master far and far away I am quite persuaded that my critic
was genuinely pleased with the book over which he thus pyrotechnicated
as poor Artemus used to say but I think my judgment the more sane
and sober of the two I have not the faintest desire to pull down other
mens flags and leave my own flag flying And there is the first and
last intrusion of myself I felt it necessary and I will neither erase
it nor apologise for its presence
Side by side with the exaggerated admiration with which our professional
censors greet the crowd of newcomers it is instructive to note the
contempt into which some of our old gods have fallen The Superior
Person we have always with us He is in his essence a Prig but when
as occasionally happens his heart and intelligence ripen he loses the
characteristics which once made him a superior person Whilst he holds
his native status his special art is not to admire anything which common
people find admirable A year or two ago it became the shibboleth of his
class that they couldnt read Dickens We met suddenly a host of people
who really couldnt stand Dickens Most of them of course were the
people of whom crowds are made owning no sort of mental furniture
worth exchange or purchase They killed the fashion of despising Dickens
as a fashion and the Superior Person finding that his sorrowful
inability was no longer an exclusive thing ceased to brag about it
When a fashion in dress is popular on Hampstead Heath on Bank Holiday
festivals the people who originally set the fashion discard it and set
another In half a generation some of our superiors for the mere sake
of originality in judgment will be going back to the pages of that
immortal masterimmortal as men count literary immortalityand will
begin to tell us that after all there was really something in him
It was Mr W D Howells an American writer of distinguished ability
as times go who set afloat the phrase that since the death of Thackeray
and Dickens fiction has become a finer art If Mr Howells had meant
what many people supposed him to mean the saying would have been merely
impudent He used the word finer in its literal sense and meant only
that a fashion of minuteness in investigation and in style had come upon
us There is a sense in which the dissector who makes a reticulation of
the muscular and nervous systems of a little finger is a finer surgeon
than the giant of the hospitals whose diagnosis is an inspiration and
whose knife carves unerringly to the root of disease There is a sense
in which a sculptor carving on cherrystones likenesses of commonplace
people would be a finer artist than Michael Angelo whose custom it
was to handle forms of splendour on an heroic scale of size In that
sense and in the hands of some of its practitioners fiction for a
year or two became a finer art than it had ever been before But the
microscopist was never popular and could never hope to be He is dead
now and the younger men are giving us vigorous copies of Dumas and
Scott and Edgar Allan Poe and some of them are fusing the methods of
Dickens with those of later and earlier writers We are in for an era of
broad effect again
But a great many people and amongst them some who ought to have known
better adopted the saying of Mr Howells in a wider sense than he ever
intended it to carry and partly as a result of this we have arrived
at a certain tacit depreciation of the greatest emotional master of
fiction There are other and more cogent reasons for the temporary
obscuration of that brilliant light It may aid our present purpose to
discover what they are
Every age has its fashions in literature as it has in dress All the
beautiful fashions in literature at least have been thought worthy of
revival and imitation but there has come to each in turn a moment when
it has begun to pall upon the fancy Every school before its death
is fated to inspire satiety and weariness The more overwhelming its
success has been the more complete and sweeping is the welcomed change
We know how the world thrilled and wept over Pamela and Clarissa and
we know how their particular form of pathos sated the world and died
We know what a turn enchanted castles had and how their spell withered
into nothing We know what a triumphal progress the Sentimental Sufferer
made through the world and what a bore he came to be It is success
which kills Success breeds imitation and the imitators are a
weariness And it is not the genius who dies It is only the school
which arose to mimic him Richardson is alive for everybody but the
dull and stupid Now that the world of fiction is no longer crowded with
enchanted castles we can go to live in one occasionally for a change
and enjoy ourselves Werther is our friend again though the school he
founded was probably the most tiresome the world has seen
Now with the solitary exception of Sir Walter Scott it is probable
that no man ever inspired such a host of imitators as Charles Dickens
There is not a writer of fiction at this hour in any land where fiction
is a recognised trade or art who is not whether he knows it and owns
it or no largely influenced by Dickens His method has got into the
atmosphere of fiction as that of all really great writers must do
and we might as well swear to unmix our oxygen and hydrogen as to stand
clear of his influences To stand clear of those influences you must
stand apart from all modern thought and sentiment You must have read
nothing that has been written in the last sixty years and you must have
been bred on a desert island Dickens has a living part in the life of
the whole wide world He is on a hundred thousand magisterial benches
every day There is not a hospital patient in any country who has not
at this minute a right to thank God that Dickens lived What his blessed
and bountiful hand has done for the poor and oppressed and them
that had no helper no man knows He made charity and good feeling a
religion Millions and millions of money have flowed from the coffers of
the rich for the benefit of the poor because of his books A great part
of our daily life and a good deal of the best of it is of his making
No single man ever made such opportunities for himself No single man
was ever so widely and permanently useful No single man ever sowed
gentleness and mercy with so broad a sweep
This is all true and very far from new but it has not been the fashion
to say it lately It is not the whole of the truth Noble rivers have
their own natural defects of swamp and mudbank Sometimes his tides ran
sluggishly as in The Battle of Life for example which has always
seemed to me at least a most mawkish and unreal book The pure stream
of The Carol which washes the heart of a man runs thin in The
Chimes runs thinner in The Haunted Man and in The Battle of Life
is lees and mud Nickleby again is a young mans book and as full
of blemishes as of genius But when all is said and done it killed the
Yorkshire schools
The chief fault the superficial modern critic has to find with Dickens
is a sort of rumbustious boisterousness in the expression of emotion
But let one thing be pointed out and let me point it out in my own
fashion Tom Hood who was a true poet and the best of our English
wits and probably as good a judge of good work as any person now alive
went home after meeting with Dickens and in a playful enthusiasm told
his wife to cut off his hand and bottle it because it had shaken hands
with Boz Lord Jeffrey who was cold as a critic cried over little
Nell So did Sydney Smith who was very far from being a blubbering
sentimentalist To judge rightly of any kind of dish you must bring
an appetite to it Here is the famous Dickens pie when first served
pronounced inimitable not by a class or a clique but by all men in
all lands But you get it served hot and you get it served cold it is
rehashed in every literary restaurant you detect its flavour in your
morning leader and your weekly review The pie gravy finds its way into
the prose and the verse of a whole young generation It has a striking
flavour an individual flavour It gets into everything We are weary
of the ceaseless resurrections of that once so toothsome dish Take it
away
The original pie is no worse and no better but thousands of cooks have
had the recipe for it and have tried to make it Appetite may have
vanished but the pie was a good pie
No simile runs on all fours and this parable in a piedish is a poor
traveller
But this principle of judgment applies of necessity to all great work
in art It does not apply to merely good work for that is nearly always
imitative and therefore not much provocative of imitation It happens
sometimes that an imitator to the undiscerning reader may even
seem better than the man he mimics because he has a modern touch But
remember in his time the master also was a modern
The new man says of Dickens that his sentiment rings false This is a
mistake It rings oldfashioned No false note ever moved a world and
the world combined to love his very name There were tears in thousands
of households when he died and they were as sincere and as real as if
they had arisen at the loss of a personal friend
We who in spite of fashion remain true to our allegiance to the
magician of our youth who can never worship or love another as we loved
and worshipped him are quite contented in the slight inevitable dimming
of his fame He is still in the hearts of the people and there he has
only one rival
No attempt at a review of modern fiction can be made without a mention
of the men who were greatest when the art was great When we have done
with the giants we will come down to the big fellows and by that time
we shall have an eye for the proportions of the rest But before we
part for the time being let me offer the uncritical reader one valuable
touchstone Let him recall the stories he has read say five years ago
If he can find a live man or woman anywhere amongst his memories who
is still as a friend or an enemy to him he has fifty to one read a
sterling book Dickens people stand this test with all readers whether
they admire him or no Even when they are grotesque they are alive They
live in the memory even of the careless like real people And this is
the one unfailing trial by which great fiction may be known
IICHARLES READE
Reades position in literature is distinctly strange The professional
critics never came within miles of a just appreciation of his greatness
and the average cultured reader receives his name with a droll air of
allowance and patronage But there are some and these are not the least
qualified as judges who regard him as ranking with the great masters
You will find I think that the men holding this opinion are in the
main fellowworkers in the craft he practised His warmest and most
constant admirers are his brother novelists Trollope to be sure
spoke of him as almost a man of genius but Trollopes mind was a
quintessential distillation of the commonplace and the man who was on
fire with the romance and passion of his own age was outside the limit
of his understanding But amongst the writers of English fiction whom
it has been my privilege to know personally I have not met with one who
has not reckoned Charles Reade a giant
The critics have never acknowledged him and in a measure he has been
neglected by the public There is a reason for everything if we could
only find it and sometimes I seem to have a glimmering of light on this
perplexing problem Sir Walter Besant Mr Besant then wrote in the
Gentlemans Magazine years ago a daring panegyric on Reades work
giving him frankly a place among the very greatest My heart glowed as I
read but I know now that it took courage of the rarer sort to express
a judgment so unreserved in favour of a writer who never for an hour
occupied in the face of the public such a position as is held by three
or four men in our day whom this dead master could have rolled in the
hollow of his hand
Let me try for a minute or two to show why and how he is so very great
a man and then let me try to point out one or two of the reasons for
which the true reward of greatness has been denied him
The very first essential to greatness in any pursuit is that a man
should be in earnest in respect to it You may as well try to kindle
your household fire with pump water as to excite laughter by the
invention of a story which does not seem laughable to yourself or to
draw real tears by a story conceived whilst your own heart is dry The
wounded is the wounding heart In Charles Reades case this essential
sympathy amounted to a passion He derided difficulties but he derided
them after the fashion of the thoroughgoing enthusiast and not after
that of the sluggard He made up his mind to write fiction and he
practised for years before he printed a line He assured himself of
methods of selection and of forms of expression Better equipped by
nature than one in a hundred of those who follow the profession he had
chosen he laboured with a fiery unresting patience to complete his
armoury and to perfect himself in the handling of its every weapon He
read omnivorously and throughout his literary lifetime he made it
his business to collect and to collate to classify and to catalogue
innumerable fragments of character of history of current news of
evanescent yet vital stuffs of all sorts In the last year but one of
his life he went with me over some of the stupendous volumes he had
built in this way The vast books remain as an illustration of his
industry but only one who has seen him in consultation with their pages
can guess the accuracy and intimacy of his knowledge of their contents
They seem to deal with everything and with whatever they enclosed he
was familiar
This encyclopaedic industry would have left a commonplace man
commonplace and in the estimate of a great mans genius it takes rank
merely as a characteristic His sympathy for his chosen craft was backed
by a sympathy for humanity just as intense and impassioned He was a
glorious lover and hater of lovable and hateful things
In one respect he was almost unique amongst men for he united a savage
detestation of wrong with a most minute accuracy in his judgment of its
extent and quality He laboured in the investigation of the problems
of his own age with the cold diligence of an antiquary He came to a
conclusion with the calm of a great judge And when his cause was sure
he threw himself upon it with an extraordinary and sustained energy The
rage of his advocacy is in surprising contrast with the patience exerted
in building up his case
Reade had a poets recognition for the greatness of his own time He saw
the epic nature of the events of his own hour the epic character of the
men who moulded those events Hundreds of years hence when federated
Australia is thickly sown with great cities and the islandcontinent
has grown to its fulness of accomplished nationhood and is grey in
honour Reades nervous English which may by that time have grown
quaint and only legible to learned eves will preserve the history of
its beginnings That part of His work indeed is purely and wholly epic
in sentiment and discernment however colloquial in form and it is
the sole example of its kind since it was written by one who was
contemporary with the events described
Reade was pretty constantly at war with his critics but he fairly
justified himself of the reviewer in his own day and at this time the
people who assailed him have something like a right to sleep in peace
In private life one of the most amiable of men and distinguished for
courtesy and kindness he was a swashbuckler in controversy He had a
trick of being in the right which his opponents found displeasing
and he was sometimes cruel in his impatience of stupidity and
wrongheadedness Scarcely any continuance in folly could have
inspired most men to the retorts he occasionally made He wrote to one
unfortunate SirYou have ventured to contradict me on a question
with regard to which I am profoundly learned where you are ignorant
as dirt It was quite true but another kind of man would have found
another way of saying it
That trick of being right came out with marked effect in the discussion
which accompanied the issue of Hard Cash in All the Year Round A
practitioner in lunacy condemned one of the authors statements as a
bald impossibility Reade answered that the impossibility in question
disguised itself as fact and went through the hollow form of taking
place on such and such a date in such and such a public court and was
recorded in such and such contemporary journals Whenever he made a
crusade against a public evil as when he assailed the prison system
or the madhouse system or the system of rattening in trades unions his
case was supported by huge collections of indexed fact and in the fight
which commonly followed he could appeal to unimpeachable records but
again and again the angry fervour of the advocate led people to forget
or to distrust the judicial accuracy on which his case invariably
rested
When all is said and done his claim to immortality lies less in the
books which deal with the splendours and the scandals of his own
age than in that monument of learning of humour of pathos and of
narrative skill The Cloister and the Hearth It is not too much to
say of this book that on its own lines it is without a rival To the
reader it seems to be not less than the revival of a dead age To assert
dogmatically that the bygone people with whom it deals could not have
been other than it paints them would be to pretend to a knowledge
greater than the writers own But they are not the men and women with
whom we are familiar in real life and they are not the men and women
with whom other writers of fiction have made us acquainted Yet they are
indubitably human and alive and we doubt them no more than the people
with whom we rub shoulders in the street Dr Conan Doyle once said
to me what I thought a memorable thing about this book To read it he
said was like going through the Dark Ages with a dark lantern It
is so indeed You pass along the devious route from old Sevenbergen to
mediaeval Rome and wherever the narrative leads you the searchlight
flashes on everything and out of the darkness and the dust and death of
centuries life leaps at you And I know nothing in English prose which
for a noble and simple eloquence surpasses the opening and the closing
paragraphs of this great work norwith some naive and almost childish
passages of humour omitteda richer terser purer or more perfect
style than that of the whole narrative Nowadays the fashion in
criticism has changed and the feeblest duffer amongst us receives
welcome ten times more enthusiastic and praise less measured than was
bestowed upon The Cloister and the Hearth when it first saw the light
Think only for a momentthink what would happen if such a book should
suddenly be launched upon us Honestly there could be no reviewing
it Our superlatives have been used so often to describe at the best
good plain sound work and at the worst frank rubbish that we have
no vocabulary for excellence of such a cast
It is worth while to record here a phrase used by Charles
Reade to me in reference to this work He was rebutting the
charge of plagiarism which had been brought against him and
he said laughingly  It is true that I milked three hundred
cows into my bucket but the butter I churned was my own
And now how comes it that with genius scholarship and style with
laughter and terror and tears at his order this great writer halts in
his stride towards the place which should be his by right It seems to
me at times as if I had a partial answer to that question I believe
that a judicious editor without a solitary act of impiety could give
Charles Reade undisputed and indisputable rank Onehalf the whole
business is a question of printing This great and admirable writer had
one constant fault which is so vulgar and trivial that it remains
as much of a wonder as it is of an offence He seeks emphasis by the
expedient of big type and small type of capitals and small capitals
of italics and black letter and of tawdry little illustrations Long
before the reader arrives at the point at which it is intended that his
emotions shall be stirred his eye warns him that the shock is coming
He knows beforehand that the rhetorical bolt is to fall just there and
when it comes it is ten to one that he finds the effect disappointing
Or the change from the uniformity of the page draws his eye to the
displayed passages and he is tantalised into reading them out of
their proper place and order Take for instance an example which just
occurs to me In It is Never Too Late to Mend Fielding and Robinson
are lost in an Australian forestbushed as the local phrase goes At
that hour they are being hunted for their lives They fall into a sort
of devils circle and as lost men have often done they come in the
course of their wanderings upon their own trail For awhile they follow
it in the hope that it will lead them to some camp or settlement
Suddenly Fielding becomes aware that they are following the track of
their own earlier footprints and almost in the same breath he discovers
that these are joined by the traces of other feet He reads a fatal and
true meaning into this sign looks to his weapons and starts off at a
mended pace What are you doing asks Robinson and Fielding answers
in capital letters I am hunting the hunters The situation is
admirably dramatic Chance has so ordered it that the pursued are
actually behind the pursuers and the presence of the intended murderers
is proclaimed by a device which is at once simple natural novel and
surprising All the elements for success in thrilling narrative are
here and the style never lulls for a second or for a second allows
the strain of the position to relax But those capital letters have
long since called the eye of the reader to themselves and the point the
writer tries to emphasise is doubly lost It has been forestalled and
has become an irritation You come on it twice you have been robbed of
anticipation and suspense which just here are the life and soul of
art You know before you ought to be allowed to guess and worst of
all perhaps you feel that your own intelligence has been affronted
Surely you had imagination enough to feel the significance of the line
without this meretricious trick to aid you It is not the business of
a great master in fiction to jog the elbow of the unimaginative and
to say Wake up at this or Here it is your duty to the narrative to
experience a thrill
Another and an equally characteristic fault though of far less frequent
occurrence is Reades fashion of intruding himself upon his reader
He stands in a curiously irritating way between the picture he has
painted and the man he has invited to look at it In one instance he
drags the eye down to a footnote in order that you may read I C R
say thiswhich is very little more or less than an impertinence The
sense of humour which probably twinkled in the writers mind is faint at
the best We know that he C R said that We are giving of our time
and intelligence to C R and we are rather sorry than otherwise to
find him indulging in this small buffoonery
It should I think be an instruction to future publishers of Charles
Reade to give him Christian printingto confine him in the body of
his narrative to one fount of type and rigorously to deny him the use
except in their accustomed and orthodox places of capitals small
capitals and italics And I cannot think that any irreverence could be
charged against an editor who had the courage to put a moist pen through
those expressions of egotism and naive selfsatisfaction and vanity
which do occasionally disfigure his pages
I ask myself if these triflesfor in comparison with the sum of Reades
genius they are small things indeedcan in any reasonable measure
account for the neglect which undoubtedly besets him In narrative
vigour he has but one rivalDumas pereand he is far and away the
master of that rival in everything but energy No male writer surpasses
him in the knowledge of feminine human nature There is no lovemaking
in literature to beat the story of the courtship of Julia Dodd and
Alfred Hardy in Hard Cash In mere descriptive power he ranks with the
giants Witness the mill on fire in The Cloister and the Hearth the
lark in exile in Never too Late to Mend the boatrace in Hard Cash
the scene of Kate Peyton at the firelit window and Griffith in the
snow in Griffith Gaunt There are a thousand bursts of laughter in
his pages not mere sniggers but lungshaking laughters and the man
who can go by any one of a hundred pathetic passages without tears is
a man to be pitied Let it be admitted that at times he wrenches his
English rather fiercely and yet let it be said that for delicacy
strength sincerity clarity and all great graces of style he is side
by side with the noblest of our prose writers Can it be that a few
scattered drops of vulgarity in emphasis dim such a fire as this
Does so small a dead fly taint so big a pot of ointment I will not be
foolish enough to dogmatise on such a point and yet I can find no other
reasons than those I have already given why a mastercraftsman should
not hold a mastercraftsmans place Solomon has told us what a little
folly can do for him who is in reputation for wisdom The great mass
of the public can always tell what pleases it but it cannot always tell
why it is pleased
And the man who writes for wide and lasting fame has to depend not upon
the verdict of the expert and the cultured but on the love of those who
only know they love and who have no power to give the critical why and
wherefore The publicthe stupid and ignorant pig of a public as
Pococurante called it years agois always being abused and yet it is
only the public which in the end can tell us if we have done well or
ill We have all to consent to be measured by it and in the long run
it estimates our stature with a perfect accuracy
I hope I may not be thought impertinent in intruding here a reminiscence
of Reade which seems characteristic of his sweeter side In reading over
these pages for the press I have been moved to a mournful and tender
remembrance of the only one of the three great Vanished Masters whom it
was my happy chance to meet in the flesh I dedicated to him the second
novel which left my penthe third to reach the publicand in sending
him the volumes on the day of issue I wrote what I remember as a rather
boyish letter in which I was at no pains to disguise my admiration for
his genius That admiration was not then tempered by the considerations
which are expressed above for they touched me only after many years of
practice in the art he adorned so richly He answered with a gentle and
sad courtesy and concluded with these words It is no discredit in a
young man to esteem a senior beyond his merits I have always thought
that very graceful and felicitous and now that I am myself grown to be
a senior I am more persuaded of its charm than ever
IIIROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON
In the scheme of this series as originallyannounced Thackerays work
should have formed the subject of the third chapter But on reflection
I have decided that considering my present purpose it would be little
more than a useless selfindulgence to do what I at first intended
There is no sort of dispute about Thackeray There is no need for any
revision of the general opinion concerning him It would be to me
personally a delightful thing to write such an appreciation as I had in
mind but this is not the place for it
Let us pass then at once to the consideration of the incomplete and
arrested labours of the charming and accomplished workman whose loss all
lovers of English literature are still lamenting
I have special and private reasons for thinking warmly of Robert Louis
Stevenson the man and these reasons seem to give me some added warrant
for an attempt to do justice to Robert Louis Stevenson the writer With
the solitary exception of the unfortunate cancelled letters from Samoa
which were written whilst he was in illhealth and suffered a complete
momentary eclipse of style he has scarcely published a line which may
not afford the most captious reader pleasure With that sole exception
he was always an artist in his work and always showed himself alive
to the fingertips He was in constant conscious search of felicities in
expression and his taste was exquisitely just His discernment in the
use of words kept equal pace with his inventionhe knew at once how to
be fastidious and daring It is to be doubted if any writer has laboured
with more constancy to enrich and harden the texture of his style
and at the last a page of his was like cloth of gold for purity and
solidity
This is the praise which the future critics of English literature will
award him But in this age of critical hysteria it is not enough to
yield a man the palm for his own qualities With regard to Stevenson our
