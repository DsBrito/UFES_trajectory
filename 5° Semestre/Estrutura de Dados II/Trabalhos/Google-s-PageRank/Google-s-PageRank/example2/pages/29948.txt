There was no paradox at all The cube remained
But the entire rest of the Universe professors and all vanished
Sentry
He was wet and muddy and hungry and cold and he was fifty thousand
lightyears from home
A strange blue sun gave light and the gravity twice what he was used
to made every movement difficult
But in tens of thousands of years this part of war hadnt changed The
flyboys were fine with their sleek spaceships and their fancy weapons
When the chips are down though it was still the foot soldier the
infantry that had to take the ground and hold it foot by bloody foot
Like this damned planet of a star hed never heard of until theyd
landed him there And now it was sacred ground because the aliens were
there too The aliens the only other intelligent race in the
Galaxy  cruel hideous and repulsive monsters
Illustration
Contact had been made with them near the center of the Galaxy after the
slow difficult colonization of a dozen thousand planets and it had
been war at sight theyd shot without even trying to negotiate or to
make peace
Now planet by bitter planet it was being fought out
He was wet and muddy and hungry and cold and the day was raw with a
high wind that hurt his eyes But the aliens were trying to infiltrate
and every sentry post was vital
He stayed alert gun ready Fifty thousand lightyears from home
fighting on a strange world and wondering if hed ever live to see home
again
And then he saw one of them crawling toward him He drew a bead and
fired The alien made that strange horrible sound they all make then
lay still
He shuddered at the sound and sight of the alien lying there One ought
to be able to get used to them after a while but hed never been able
to Such repulsive creatures they were with only two arms and two legs
ghastly white skins and no scales

Section 4  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate
International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card

Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US

keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
