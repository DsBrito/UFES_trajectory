every representative of a new idea has had to struggle and suffer
under similar difficulties  Is it of any avail that a former
president of a republic pays homage at Osawatomie to the memory of
John Brown  Or that the president of another republic participates
in the unveiling of a statue in honor of Pierre Proudhon and holds
up his life to the French nation as a model worthy of enthusiastic
emulation  Of what avail is all this when at the same time the
LIVING John Browns and Proudhons are being crucified  The honor and
glory of a Mary Wollstonecraft or of a Louise Michel are not enhanced
by the City Fathers of London or Paris naming a street after
themthe living generation should be concerned with doing justice to
the LIVING Mary Wollstonecrafts and Louise Michels  Posterity
assigns to men like Wendel Phillips and Lloyd Garrison the proper
niche of honor in the temple of human emancipation but it is the
duty of their contemporaries to bring them due recognition and
appreciation while they live
The path of the propagandist of social justice is strewn with thorns
The powers of darkness and injustice exert all their might lest a ray
of sunshine enter his cheerless life  Nay even his comrades in the
struggleindeed too often his most intimate friendsshow but
little understanding for the personality of the pioneer  Envy
sometimes growing to hatred vanity and jealousy obstruct his way
and fill his heart with sadness  It requires an inflexible will and
tremendous enthusiasm not to lose under such conditions all faith
in the Cause  The representative of a revolutionizing idea stands
between two fires on the one hand the persecution of the existing
powers which hold him responsible for all acts resulting from social
conditions and on the other the lack of understanding on the part
of his own followers who often judge all his activity from a narrow
standpoint  Thus it happens that the agitator stands quite alone in
the midst of the multitude surrounding him  Even his most intimate
friends rarely understand how solitary and deserted he feels  That
is the tragedy of the person prominent in the public eye
The mist in which the name of Emma Goldman has so long been enveloped
is gradually beginning to dissipate  Her energy in the furtherance
of such an unpopular idea as Anarchism her deep earnestness her
courage and abilities find growing understanding and admiration
The debt American intellectual growth owes to the revolutionary
exiles has never been fully appreciated  The seed disseminated by
them though so little understood at the time has brought a rich
harvest  They have at all times held aloft the banner of liberty
thus impregnating the social vitality of the Nation  But very few
have succeeding in preserving their European education and culture
while at the same time assimilating themselves with American life
It is difficult for the average man to form an adequate conception
what strength energy and perseverance are necessary to absorb the
unfamiliar language habits and customs of a new country without
the loss of ones own personality
Emma Goldman is one of the few who while thoroughly preserving their
individuality have become an important factor in the social and
intellectual atmosphere of America  The life she leads is rich in
color full of change and variety  She has risen to the topmost
heights and she has also tasted the bitter dregs of life
Emma Goldman was born of Jewish parentage on the 27th day of June
1869 in the Russian province of Kovno  Surely these parents never
dreamed what unique position their child would some day occupy  Like
all conservative parents they too were quite convinced that their
daughter would marry a respectable citizen bear him children and
round out her allotted years surrounded by a flock of grandchildren
a good religious woman  As most parents they had no inkling what a
strange impassioned spirit would take hold of the soul of their
child and carry it to the heights which separate generations in
eternal struggle  They lived in a land and at a time when antagonism
between parent and offspring was fated to find its most acute
expression irreconcilable hostility  In this tremendous struggle
between fathers and sonsand especially between parents and
daughtersthere was no compromise no weak yielding no truce  The
spirit of liberty of progressan idealism which knew no
considerations and recognized no obstaclesdrove the young
generation out of the parental house and away from the hearth of the
home  Just as this same spirit once drove out the revolutionary
breeder of discontent Jesus and alienated him from his native
traditions
What role the Jewish racenotwithstanding all antisemitic calumnies
the race of transcendental idealismplayed in the struggle of the
Old and the New will probably never be appreciated with complete
impartiality and clarity  Only now are we beginning to perceive the
tremendous debt we owe to Jewish idealists in the realm of science
art and literature  But very little is still known of the important
part the sons and daughters of Israel have played in the
revolutionary movement and especially in that of modern times
The first years of her childhood Emma Goldman passed in a small
idyllic place in the GermanRussian province of Kurland where her
father had charge of the government stage  At the time Kurland was
thoroughly German even the Russian bureaucracy of that Baltic
province was recruited mostly from German JUNKERS  German fairy
tales and stories rich in the miraculous deeds of the heroic knights
of Kurland wove their spell over the youthful mind  But the
beautiful idyl was of short duration  Soon the soul of the growing
child was overcast by the dark shadows of life  Already in her
tenderest youth the seeds of rebellion and unrelenting hatred of
oppression were to be planted in the heart of Emma Goldman  Early
she learned to know the beauty of the State she saw her father
harassed by the Christian CHINOVNIKS and doubly persecuted as petty
official and hated Jew  The brutality of forced conscription ever
stood before her eyes she beheld the young men often the sole
supporter of a large family brutally dragged to the barracks to lead
the miserable life of a soldier  She heard the weeping of the poor
peasant women and witnessed the shameful scenes of official venality
which relieved the rich from military service at the expense of the
poor  She was outraged by the terrible treatment to which the female
servants were subjected maltreated and exploited by their BARINYAS
they fell to the tender mercies of the regimental officers who
regarded them as their natural sexual prey  The girls made pregnant
by respectable gentlemen and driven out by their mistresses often
found refuge in the Goldman home  And the little girl her heart
palpitating with sympathy would abstract coins from the parental
drawer to clandestinely press the money into the hands of the
unfortunate women  Thus Emma Goldmans most striking characteristic
her sympathy with the underdog already became manifest in these
early years
At the age of seven little Emma was sent by her parents to her
grandmother at Konigsberg the city of Emanuel Kant in Eastern
Prussia  Save for occasional interruptions she remained there till her
13th birthday  The first years in these surroundings do not exactly
belong to her happiest recollections  The grandmother indeed was
very amiable but the numerous aunts of the household were concerned
more with the spirit of practical rather than pure reason and the
categoric imperative was applied all too frequently  The situation
was changed when her parents migrated to Konigsberg and little Emma
was relieved from her role of Cinderella  She now regularly attended
public school and also enjoyed the advantages of private instruction
customary in middle class life French and music lessons played an
important part in the curriculum  The future interpreter of Ibsen
and Shaw was then a little German Gretchen quite at home in the
German atmosphere  Her special predilections in literature were the
sentimental romances of Marlitt she was a great admirer of the good
Queen Louise whom the bad Napoleon Buonaparte treated with so marked
a lack of knightly chivalry  What might have been her future
development had she remained in this milieu  Fateor was it
economic necessitywilled it otherwise  Her parents decided to
settle in St Petersburg the capital of the Almighty Tsar and there
to embark in business  It was here that a great change took place in
the life of the young dreamer
It was an eventful periodthe year of 1882in which Emma Goldman
then in her 13th year arrived in St Petersburg  A struggle for
life and death between the autocracy and the Russian intellectuals
swept the country  Alexander II had fallen the previous year
Sophia Perovskaia Zheliabov Grinevitzky Rissakov Kibalchitch
Michailov the heroic executors of the death sentence upon the
tyrant had then entered the Walhalla of immortality  Jessie
Helfman the only regicide whose life the government had reluctantly
spared because of pregnancy followed the unnumbered Russian martyrs
to the etapes of Siberia  It was the most heroic period in the great
battle of emancipation a battle for freedom such as the world had
never witnessed before  The names of the Nihilist martyrs were on
all lips and thousands were enthusiastic to follow their example
The whole INTELLIGENZIA of Russia was filled with the ILLEGAL
spirit revolutionary sentiments penetrated into every home from
mansion to hovel impregnating the military the CHINOVNIKS factory
workers and peasants  The atmosphere pierced the very casemates of
the royal palace  New ideas germinated in the youth  The difference
of sex was forgotten  Shoulder to shoulder fought the men and the
women  The Russian woman  Who shall ever do justice or adequately
portray her heroism and selfsacrifice her loyalty and devotion
Holy Turgeniev calls her in his great prose poem ON THE THRESHOLD
It was inevitable that the young dreamer from Konigsberg should be
drawn into the maelstrom  To remain outside of the circle of free
ideas meant a life of vegetation of death  One need not wonder at
the youthful age  Young enthusiasts were not thenand fortunately
are not nowa rare phenomenon in Russia  The study of the Russian
language soon brought young Emma Goldman in touch with revolutionary
students and new ideas  The place of Marlitt was taken by Nekrassov
and Tchernishevsky  The quondam admirer of the good Queen Louise
became a glowing enthusiast of liberty resolving like thousands of
others to devote her life to the emancipation of the people
The struggle of generations now took place in the Goldman family
The parents could not comprehend what interest their daughter could
find in the new ideas which they themselves considered fantastic
utopias  They strove to persuade the young girl out of these
chimeras and daily repetition of soulracking disputes was the
result  Only in one member of the family did the young idealist find
understandingin her elder sister Helene with whom she later
emigrated to America and whose love and sympathy have never failed
her  Even in the darkest hours of later persecution Emma Goldman
always found a haven of refuge in the home of this loyal sister
Emma Goldman finally resolved to achieve her independence  She saw
hundreds of men and women sacrificing brilliant careers to go V
NAROD to the people  She followed their example  She became a
factory worker at first employed as a corset maker and later in the
manufacture of gloves  She was now 17 years of age and proud to earn
her own living  Had she remained in Russia she would have probably
sooner or later shared the fate of thousands buried in the snows of
Siberia  But a new chapter of life was to begin for her  Sister
Helene decided to emigrate to America where another sister had
already made her home  Emma prevailed upon Helene to be allowed to
join her and together they departed for America filled with the
joyous hope of a great free land the glorious Republic
America  What magic word  The yearning of the enslaved the
promised land of the oppressed the goal of all longing for progress
Here mans ideals had found their fulfillment no Tsar no Cossack
no CHINOVNIK  The Republic  Glorious synonym of equality freedom
brotherhood
Thus thought the two girls as they travelled in the year 1886 from
New York to Rochester  Soon all too soon disillusionment awaited
them  The ideal conception of America was punctured already at
Castle Garden and soon burst like a soap bubble  Here Emma Goldman
witnessed sights which reminded her of the terrible scenes of her
childhood in Kurland  The brutality and humiliation the future
citizens of the great Republic were subjected to on board ship were
repeated at Castle Garden by the officials of the democracy in a more
savage and aggravating manner  And what bitter disappointment
followed as the young idealist began to familiarize herself with the
conditions in the new land  Instead of one Tsar she found scores of
them the Cossack was replaced by the policeman with the heavy club
and instead of the Russian CHINOVNIK there was the far more inhuman
slavedriver of the factory
Emma Goldman soon obtained work in the clothing establishment of the
Garson Co  The wages amounted to two and a half dollars a week  At
that time the factories were not provided with motor power and the
poor sewing girls had to drive the wheels by foot from early morning
till late at night  A terribly exhausting toil it was without a ray
of light the drudgery of the long day passed in complete
silencethe Russian custom of friendly conversation at work was not
permissible in the free country  But the exploitation of the girls
was not only economic the poor wage workers were looked upon by
their foremen and bosses as sexual commodities  If a girl resented
the advances of her superiors she would speedily find herself on
the street as an undesirable element in the factory  There was never
a lack of willing victims the supply always exceeded the demand
The horrible conditions were made still more unbearable by the
fearful dreariness of life in the small American city  The Puritan
spirit suppresses the slightest manifestation of joy a deadly
dullness beclouds the soul no intellectual inspiration no thought
exchange between congenial spirits is possible  Emma Goldman almost
suffocated in this atmosphere  She above all others longed for
ideal surroundings for friendship and understanding for the
companionship of kindred minds  Mentally she still lived in Russia
Unfamiliar with the language and life of the country she dwelt more
in the past than in the present  It was at this period that she met
a young man who spoke Russian  With great joy the acquaintance was
cultivated  At last a person with whom she could converse one who
could help her bridge the dullness of the narrow existence  The
friendship gradually ripened and finally culminated in marriage
Emma Goldman too had to walk the sorrowful road of married life
she too had to learn from bitter experience that legal statutes
signify dependence and selfeffacement especially for the woman
The marriage was no liberation from the Puritan dreariness of
American life indeed it was rather aggravated by the loss of
selfownership  The characters of the young people differed too
widely  A separation soon followed and Emma Goldman went to New
Haven Conn  There she found employment in a factory and her
husband disappeared from her horizon  Two decades later she was
fated to be unexpectedly reminded of him by the Federal authorities
The revolutionists who were active in the Russian movement of the
80s were but little familiar with the social ideas then agitating
Western Europe and America  Their sole activity consisted in
educating the people their final goal the destruction of the
autocracy  Socialism and Anarchism were terms hardly known even by
name  Emma Goldman too was entirely unfamiliar with the
significance of those ideals
She arrived in America as four years previously in Russia at a
period of great social and political unrest  The working people were
in revolt against the terrible labor conditions the eighthour
movement of the Knights of Labor was at its height and throughout
the country echoed the din of sanguine strife between strikers and
police  The struggle culminated in the great strike against the
Harvester Company of Chicago the massacre of the strikers and the
judicial murder of the labor leaders which followed upon the
historic Haymarket bomb explosion  The Anarchists stood the martyr
test of blood baptism  The apologists of capitalism vainly seek to
justify the killing of Parsons Spies Lingg Fischer and Engel
Since the publication of Governor Altgelds reason for his liberation
of the three incarcerated Haymarket Anarchists no doubt is left that
a fivefold legal murder had been committed in Chicago in 1887
Very few have grasped the significance of the Chicago martyrdom
least of all the ruling classes  By the destruction of a number of
labor leaders they thought to stem the tide of a worldinspiring
idea  They failed to consider that from the blood of the martyrs
grows the new seed and that the frightful injustice will win new
converts to the Cause
The two most prominent representatives of the Anarchist idea in
America Voltairine de Cleyre and Emma Goldmanthe one a native
American the other a Russianhave been converted like numerous
others to the ideas of Anarchism by the judicial murder  Two women
who had not known each other before and who had received a widely
different education were through that murder united in one idea
Like most working men and women of America Emma Goldman followed the
Chicago trial with great anxiety and excitement  She too could not
believe that the leaders of the proletariat would be killed  The
11th of November 1887 taught her differently  She realized that no
mercy could be expected from the ruling class that between the
Tsarism of Russia and the plutocracy of America there was no
difference save in name  Her whole being rebelled against the crime
and she vowed to herself a solemn vow to join the ranks of the
revolutionary proletariat and to devote all her energy and strength
to their emancipation from wage slavery  With the glowing enthusiasm
so characteristic of her nature she now began to familiarize herself
with the literature of Socialism and Anarchism  She attended public
meetings and became acquainted with socialistically and
anarchistically inclined workingmen  Johanna Greie the wellknown
German lecturer was the first Socialist speaker heard by Emma
Goldman  In New Haven Conn where she was employed in a corset
factory she met Anarchists actively participating in the movement
Here she read the FREIHEIT edited by John Most  The Haymarket
tragedy developed her inherent Anarchist tendencies the reading of
the FREIHEIT made her a conscious Anarchist  Subsequently she was to
learn that the idea of Anarchism found its highest expression through
the best intellects of America theoretically by Josiah Warren
Stephen Pearl Andrews Lysander Spooner philosophically by Emerson
Thoreau and Walt Whitman
Made ill by the excessive strain of factory work Emma Goldman
returned to Rochester where she remained till August 1889 at which
time she removed to New York the scene of the most important phase
of her life  She was now twenty years old  Features pallid with
suffering eyes large and full of compassion greet one in her
pictured likeness of those days  Her hair is as customary with
Russian student girls worn short giving free play to the strong
forehead
It is the heroic epoch of militant Anarchism  By leaps and bounds
the movement had grown in every country  In spite of the most severe
governmental persecution new converts swell the ranks  The
propaganda is almost exclusively of a secret character  The
repressive measures of the government drive the disciples of the new
philosophy to conspirative methods  Thousands of victims fall into
the hands of the authorities and languish in prisons  But nothing
can stem the rising tide of enthusiasm of selfsacrifice and
devotion to the Cause  The efforts of teachers like Peter Kropotkin
Louise Michel Elisee Reclus and others inspire the devotees with
ever greater energy
Disruption is imminent with the Socialists who have sacrificed the
idea of liberty and embraced the State and politics  The struggle is
bitter the factions irreconcilable  This struggle is not merely
between Anarchists and Socialists it also finds its echo within the
Anarchist groups  Theoretic differences and personal controversies
lead to strife and acrimonious enmities  The antiSocialist
legislation of Germany and Austria had driven thousands of Socialists
and Anarchists across the seas to seek refuge in America  John Most
having lost his seat in the Reichstag finally had to flee his native
land and went to London  There having advanced toward Anarchism
he entirely withdrew from the Social Democratic Party  Later coming
to America he continued the publication of the FREIHEIT in New York
and developed great activity among the German workingmen
When Emma Goldman arrived in New York in 1889 she experienced little
difficulty in associating herself with active Anarchists  Anarchist
meetings were an almost daily occurrence  The first lecturer she
heard on the Anarchist platform was Dr A Solotaroff  Of great
importance to her future development was her acquaintance with John
Most who exerted a tremendous influence over the younger elements
His impassioned eloquence untiring energy and the persecution he
had endured for the Cause all combined to enthuse the comrades  It
was also at this period that she met Alexander Berkman whose
friendship played an important part throughout her life  Her talents
as a speaker could not long remain in obscurity  The fire of
enthusiasm swept her toward the public platform  Encouraged by her
friends she began to participate as a German and Yiddish speaker at
Anarchist meetings  Soon followed a brief tour of agitation taking
her as far as Cleveland  With the whole strength and earnestness of
her soul she now threw herself into the propaganda of Anarchist
ideas  The passionate period of her life had begun  Through
constantly toiling in sweat shops the fiery young orator was at the
same time very active as an agitator and participated in various
labor struggles notably in the great cloakmakers strike in 1889
led by Professor Garsyde and Joseph Barondess
A year later Emma Goldman was a delegate to an Anarchist conference
in New York  She was elected to the Executive Committee but later
withdrew because of differences of opinion regarding tactical
matters  The ideas of the Germanspeaking Anarchists had at that
time not yet become clarified  Some still believed in parliamentary
methods the great majority being adherents of strong centralism
These differences of opinion in regard to tactics led in 1891 to a
breach with John Most  Emma Goldman Alexander Berkman and other
comrades joined the group AUTONOMY in which Joseph Peukert Otto
Rinke and Claus Timmermann played an active part  The bitter
controversies which followed this secession terminated only with the
death of Most in 1906
A great source of inspiration to Emma Goldman proved the Russian
revolutionists who were associated in the group ZNAMYA  Goldenberg
Solotaroff Zametkin Miller Cahan the poet Edelstadt Ivan von
Schewitsch husband of Helene von Racowitza and editor of the
VOLKSZEITUNG and numerous other Russian exiles some of whom are
still living were members of this group  It was also at this time
that Emma Goldman met Robert Reitzel the GermanAmerican Heine who
exerted a great influence on her development  Through him she became
acquainted with the best writers of modern literature and the
friendship thus begun lasted till Reitzels death in 1898
The labor movement of America had not been drowned in the Chicago
massacre the murder of the Anarchists had failed to bring peace to
the profitgreedy capitalist  The struggle for the eighthour day
continued  In 1892 broke out the great strike in Pittsburg  The
Homestead fight the defeat of the Pinkertons the appearance of the
militia the suppression of the strikers and the complete triumph of
the reaction are matters of comparatively recent history  Stirred to
the very depths by the terrible events at the seat of war Alexander
Berkman resolved to sacrifice his life to the Cause and thus give an
object lesson to the wage slaves of America of active Anarchist
solidarity with labor  His attack upon Frick the Gessler of
Pittsburg failed and the twentytwoyearold youth was doomed to a
living death of twentytwo years in the penitentiary  The
bourgeoisie which for decades had exalted and eulogized tyrannicide
now was filled with terrible rage  The capitalist press organized a
systematic campaign of calumny and misrepresentation against
Anarchists  The police exerted every effort to involve Emma Goldman
in the act of Alexander Berkman  The feared agitator was to be
silenced by all means  It was only due to the circumstance of her
presence in New York that she escaped the clutches of the law  It
was a similar circumstance which nine years later during the
McKinley incident was instrumental in preserving her liberty  It is
almost incredible with what amount of stupidity baseness and
vileness the journalists of the period sought to overwhelm the
Anarchist  One must peruse the newspaper files to realize the
enormity of incrimination and slander  It would be difficult to
portray the agony of soul Emma Goldman experienced in those days
The persecutions of the capitalist press were to be borne by an
Anarchist with comparative equanimity but the attacks from ones own
ranks were far more painful and unbearable  The act of Berkman was
severely criticized by Most and some of his followers among the
German and Jewish Anarchists  Bitter accusations and recriminations
at public meetings and private gatherings followed  Persecuted on
all sides both because she championed Berkman and his act and on
account of her revolutionary activity Emma Goldman was harassed even
to the extent of inability to secure shelter  Too proud to seek
safety in the denial of her identity she chose to pass the nights in
the public parks rather than expose her friends to danger or vexation
by her visits  The already bitter cup was filled to overflowing by
the attempted suicide of a young comrade who had shared living
quarters with Emma Goldman Alexander Berkman and a mutual artist
friend
Many changes have since taken place  Alexander Berkman has survived
the Pennsylvania Inferno and is back again in the ranks of the
militant Anarchists his spirit unbroken his soul full of enthusiasm
for the ideals of his youth  The artist comrade is now among the
wellknown illustrators of New York  The suicide candidate left
America shortly after his unfortunate attempt to die and was
subsequently arrested and condemned to eight years of hard labor for
smuggling Anarchist literature into Germany  He too has withstood
the terrors of prison life and has returned to the revolutionary
movement since earning the well deserved reputation of a talented
writer in Germany
To avoid indefinite camping in the parks Emma Goldman finally was
forced to move into a house on Third Street occupied exclusively by
prostitutes  There among the outcasts of our good Christian
society she could at least rent a bit of a room and find rest and
work at her sewing machine  The women of the street showed more
refinement of feeling and sincere sympathy than the priests of the
Church  But human endurance had been exhausted by overmuch suffering
and privation  There was a complete physical breakdown and the
renowned agitator was removed to the Bohemian Republica large
tenement house which derived its euphonious appellation from the fact
that its occupants were mostly Bohemian Anarchists  Here Emma
Goldman found friends ready to aid her  Justus Schwab one of the
finest representatives of the German revolutionary period of that
time and Dr Solotaroff were indefatigable in the care of the
patient  Here too she met Edward Brady the new friendship
subsequently ripening into close intimacy  Brady had been an active
participant in the revolutionary movement of Austria and had at the
time of his acquaintance with Emma Goldman lately been released from
an Austrian prison after an incarceration of ten years
Physicians diagnosed the illness as consumption and the patient was
advised to leave New York  She went to Rochester in the hope that
the home circle would help restore her to health  Her parents had
several years previously emigrated to America settling in that city
Among the leading traits of the Jewish race is the strong attachment
between the members of the family and especially between parents
and children  Though her conservative parents could not sympathize
with the idealist aspirations of Emma Goldman and did not approve of
her mode of life they now received their sick daughter with open
arms  The rest and care enjoyed in the parental home and the
cheering presence of the beloved sister Helene proved so beneficial
that within a short time she was sufficiently restored to resume her
energetic activity
There is no rest in the life of Emma Goldman  Ceaseless effort and
continuous striving toward the conceived goal are the essentials of
her nature  Too much precious time had already been wasted  It was
imperative to resume her labors immediately  The country was in the
throes of a crisis and thousands of unemployed crowded the streets
of the large industrial centers  Cold and hungry they tramped
through the land in the vain search for work and bread  The
Anarchists developed a strenuous propaganda among the unemployed and
the strikers  A monster demonstration of striking cloakmakers and of
the unemployed took place at Union Square New York  Emma Goldman
was one of the invited speakers  She delivered an impassioned
speech picturing in fiery words the misery of the wage slaves life
and quoted the famous maxim of Cardinal Manning Necessity knows no
law and the starving man has a natural right to a share of his
neighbors bread  She concluded her exhortation with the words
Ask for work  If they do not give you work ask for bread  If they
do not give you work or bread then take bread
The following day she left for Philadelphia where she was to address
a public meeting  The capitalist press again raised the alarm  If
Socialists and Anarchists were to be permitted to continue agitating
there was imminent danger that the workingmen would soon learn to
understand the manner in which they are robbed of the joy and
happiness of life  Such a possibility was to be prevented at all
cost  The Chief of Police of New York Byrnes procured a court
order for the arrest of Emma Goldman  She was detained by the
Philadelphia authorities and incarcerated for several days in the
Moyamensing prison awaiting the extradition papers which Byrnes
intrusted to Detective Jacobs  This man Jacobs whom Emma Goldman
again met several years later under very unpleasant circumstances
proposed to her while she was returning a prisoner to New York to
betray the cause of labor  In the name of his superior Chief
Byrnes he offered lucrative reward  How stupid men sometimes are
What poverty of psychologic observation to imagine the possibility of
betrayal on the part of a young Russian idealist who had willingly
sacrificed all personal considerations to help in labors
emancipation
In October 1893 Emma Goldman was tried in the criminal courts of
New York on the charge of inciting to riot  The intelligent jury
ignored the testimony of the twelve witnesses for the defense in
