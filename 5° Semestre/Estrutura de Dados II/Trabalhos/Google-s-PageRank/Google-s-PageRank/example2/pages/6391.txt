constancy and of a sullen temper  In despair of his fortunes he had
recourse to poison but was so terrified at the thoughts of death that
immediately repenting he took a vomit to throw it up again and gave
freedom to his physician for having with great prudence and wisdom
given him only a gentle dose of the poison  When Cneius Pompey was
consulting with his friends in what manner he should conduct himself
towards those who were neuter and took no part in the contest he was the
only one who proposed that they should be treated as enemies
III  He left a son who was without doubt the best of the family  By
the Pedian law he was condemned although innocent amongst others who
were concerned in the death of Caesar 556  Upon this he went over to
Brutus and Cassius his near relations and after their death not only
kept together the fleet the command of which had been given him some
time before but even increased it  At last when the party had
everywhere been defeated he voluntarily surrendered it to 339 Mark
Antony considering it as a piece of service for which the latter owed
him no small obligations  Of all those who were condemned by the law
abovementioned he was the only man who was restored to his country and
filled the highest offices  When the civil war again broke out he was
appointed lieutenant under the same Antony and offered the chief command
by those who were ashamed of Cleopatra but not daring on account of a
sudden indisposition with which he was seized either to accept or refuse
it he went over to Augustus 557 and died a few days after not
without an aspersion cast upon his memory  For Antony gave out that he
was induced to change sides by his impatience to be with his mistress
Servilia Nais 558
IV  This Cneius had a son named Domitius who was afterwards well known
as the nominal purchaser of the family property left by Augustuss will
559 and no less famous in his youth for his dexterity in
chariotdriving than he was afterwards for the triumphal ornaments which
he obtained in the German war  But he was a man of great arrogance
prodigality and cruelty  When he was aedile he obliged Lucius Plancus
the censor to give him the way and in his praetorship and consulship
he made Roman knights and married women act on the stage  He gave hunts
of wild beasts both in the Circus and in all the wards of the city as
also a show of gladiators but with such barbarity that Augustus after
privately reprimanding him to no purpose was obliged to restrain him by
a public edict
V  By the elder Antonia he had Neros father a man of execrable
character in every part of his life  During his attendance upon Caius
Caesar in the East he killed a freedman of his own for refusing to
drink as much as he ordered him  Being dismissed for this from Caesars
society he did not mend his habits for in a village upon the Appian
road he suddenly whipped his horses and drove his chariot on purpose
340 over a poor boy crushing him to pieces  At Rome he struck out
the eye of a Roman knight in the Forum only for some free language in a
dispute between them  He was likewise so fraudulent that he not only
cheated some silversmiths 560 of the price of goods he had bought of
them but during his praetorship defrauded the owners of chariots in
the Circensian games of the prizes due to them for their victory  His
sister jeering him for the complaints made by the leaders of the several
parties he agreed to sanction a law That for the future the prizes
should be immediately paid  A little before the death of Tiberius he
was prosecuted for treason adulteries and incest with his sister
Lepida but escaped in the timely change of affairs and died of a
dropsy at Pyrgi 561 leaving behind him his son Nero whom he had by
Agrippina the daughter of Germanicus
VI  Nero was born at Antium nine months after the death of Tiberius
562 upon the eighteenth of the calends of January 15th December
just as the sun rose so that its beams touched him before they could
well reach the earth  While many fearful conjectures in respect to his
future fortune were formed by different persons from the circumstances
of his nativity a saying of his father Domitius was regarded as an ill
presage who told his friends who were congratulating him upon the
occasion That nothing but what was detestable and pernicious to the
public could ever be produced of him and Agrippina  Another manifest
prognostic of his future infelicity occurred upon his lustration day
563  For Caius Caesar being requested by his sister to give the child
what name he thought properlooking at his uncle Claudius who 341
afterwards when emperor adopted Nero he gave his and this not
seriously but only in jest Agrippina treating it with contempt because
Claudius at that time was a mere laughingstock at the palace  He lost
his father when he was three years old being left heir to a third part
of his estate of which he never got possession the whole being seized
by his coheir Caius  His mother being soon after banished he lived
with his aunt Lepida in a very necessitous condition under the care of
two tutors a dancingmaster and a barber  After Claudius came to the
empire he not only recovered his fathers estate but was enriched with
the additional inheritance of that of his stepfather Crispus Passienus
Upon his mothers recall from banishment he was advanced to such favour
through Neros powerful interest with the emperor that it was reported
assassins were employed by Messalina Claudiuss wife to strangle him
as Britannicuss rival whilst he was taking his noonday repose  In
addition to the story it was said that they were frightened by a
serpent which crept from under his cushion and ran away  The tale was
occasioned by finding on his couch near the pillow the skin of a snake
which by his mothers order he wore for some time upon his right arm
inclosed in a bracelet of gold  This amulet at last he laid aside
from aversion to her memory but he sought for it again in vain in the
time of his extremity
VII  When he was yet a mere boy before he arrived at the age of
puberty during the celebration of the Circensian games 564 he
performed his part in the Trojan play with a degree of firmness which
gained him great applause  In the eleventh year of his age he was
adopted by Claudius and placed under the tuition of Annaeus Seneca
565 who had been made a senator  It is said that Seneca dreamt the
night after that he was giving a lesson to Caius Caesar 566  Nero
soon verified his dream betraying the cruelty of his disposition in
every way he could  For he attempted to persuade his father that his
brother Britannicus was nothing but a changeling because the latter
had 342 saluted him notwithstanding his adoption by the name of
Aenobarbus as usual  When his aunt Lepida was brought to trial he
appeared in court as a witness against her to gratify his mother who
persecuted the accused  On his introduction into the Forum at the age
of manhood he gave a largess to the people and a donative to the
soldiers for the pretorian cohorts he appointed a solemn procession
under arms and marched at the head of them with a shield in his hand
after which he went to return thanks to his father in the senate  Before
Claudius likewise at the time he was consul he made a speech for the
Bolognese in Latin and for the Rhodians and people of Ilium in Greek
He had the jurisdiction of praefect of the city for the first time
during the Latin festival during which the most celebrated advocates
brought before him not short and trifling causes as is usual in that
case but trials of importance notwithstanding they had instructions
from Claudius himself to the contrary  Soon afterwards he married
Octavia and exhibited the Circensian games and hunting of wild beasts
in honour of Claudius
VIII  He was seventeen years of age at the death of that prince 567
and as soon as that event was made public he went out to the cohort on
guard between the hours of six and seven for the omens were so
disastrous that no earlier time of the day was judged proper  On the
steps before the palace gate he was unanimously saluted by the soldiers
as their emperor and then carried in a litter to the camp thence after
making a short speech to the troops into the senatehouse where he
continued until the evening of all the immense honours which were heaped
upon him refusing none but the title of FATHER OF HIS COUNTRY on
account of his youth
IX  He began his reign with an ostentation of dutiful regard to the
memory of Claudius whom he buried with the utmost pomp and magnificence
pronouncing the funeral oration himself and then had him enrolled
amongst the gods  He paid likewise the highest honours to the memory of
his father Domitius  He left the management of affairs both public and
private to his mother  The word which he gave the first day of his
reign to the tribune on guard was The 343 Best of Mothers and
afterwards he frequently appeared with her in the streets of Rome in her
litter  He settled a colony at Antium in which he placed the veteran
soldiers belonging to the guards and obliged several of the richest
centurions of the first rank to transfer their residence to that place
where he likewise made a noble harbour at a prodigious expense 568
X  To establish still further his character he declared that he
designed to govern according to the model of Augustus and omitted no
opportunity of showing his generosity clemency and complaisance  The
more burthensome taxes he either entirely took off or diminished  The
rewards appointed for informers by the Papian law he reduced to a fourth
part and distributed to the people four hundred sesterces a man  To the
noblest of the senators who were much reduced in their circumstances he
granted annual allowances in some cases as much as five hundred thousand
sesterces and to the pretorian cohorts a monthly allowance of corn
gratis  When called upon to subscribe the sentence according to custom
of a criminal condemned to die I wish said he I had never learnt to
read and write  He continually saluted people of the several orders by
name without a prompter  When the senate returned him their thanks for
his good government he replied to them It will be time enough to do so
when I shall have deserved it  He admitted the common people to see him
perform his exercises in the Campus Martius  He frequently declaimed in
public and recited verses of his own composing not only at home but in
the theatre so much to the joy of all the people that public prayers
were appointed to be put up to the gods upon that account and the verses
which had been publicly read were after being written in gold letters
consecrated to Jupiter Capitolinus
344 XI  He presented the people with a great number and variety of
spectacles as the Juvenal and Circensian games stageplays and an
exhibition of gladiators  In the Juvenal he even admitted senators and
aged matrons to perform parts  In the Circensian games he assigned the
equestrian order seats apart from the rest of the people and had races
performed by chariots drawn each by four camels  In the games which he
instituted for the eternal duration of the empire and therefore ordered
to be called Maximi many of the senatorian and equestrian order of both
sexes performed  A distinguished Roman knight descended on the stage by
a rope mounted on an elephant  A Roman play likewise composed by
Afranius was brought upon the stage  It was entitled The Fire and
in it the performers were allowed to carry off and to keep to
themselves the furniture of the house which as the plot of the play
required was burnt down in the theatre  Every day during the solemnity
many thousand articles of all descriptions were thrown amongst the people
to scramble for such as fowls of different kinds tickets for corn
clothes gold silver gems pearls pictures slaves beasts of burden
wild beasts that had been tamed at last ships lots of houses and
lands were offered as prizes in a lottery
XII  These games he beheld from the front of the proscenium  In the
show of gladiators which he exhibited in a wooden amphitheatre built
within a year in the district of the Campus Martius 569 he ordered
that none should be slain not even the condemned criminals employed in
the combats  He secured four hundred senators and six hundred Roman
knights amongst whom were some of unbroken fortunes and unblemished
reputation to act as gladiators  From the same orders he engaged
persons to encounter wild beasts and for various other services in the
theatre  He presented the public with the representation of a naval
fight upon seawater with huge fishes swimming in it as also with the
Pyrrhic dance performed by certain youths to each of whom after the
performance was over he granted the freedom of Rome  During this
diversion a bull covered Pasiphae concealed within a wooden statue of a
cow as many of the spectators believed  Icarus upon his first attempt
to fly fell on the stage close to 345 the emperors pavilion and
bespattered him with blood  For he very seldom presided in the games
but used to view them reclining on a couch at first through some narrow
apertures but afterwards with the Podium 570 quite open  He was the
first who instituted 571 in imitation of the Greeks a trial of skill
in the three several exercises of music wrestling and horseracing to
be performed at Rome every five years and which he called Neronia  Upon
the dedication of his bath 572 and gymnasium he furnished the senate
and the equestrian order with oil  He appointed as judges of the trial
men of consular rank chosen by lot who sat with the praetors  At this
time he went down into the orchestra amongst the senators and received
the crown for the best performance in Latin prose and verse for which
several persons of the greatest merit contended but they unanimously
yielded to him  The crown for the best performer on the harp being
likewise awarded to him by the judges he devoutly saluted it and
ordered it to be carried to the statue of Augustus  In the gymnastic
exercises which he presented in the Septa while they were preparing the
great sacrifice of an ox he shaved his beard for the first time 573
and putting it up in a casket of gold studded with pearls of great price
consecrated it to Jupiter Capitolinus  He invited the Vestal Virgins to
see the 346 wrestlers perform because at Olympia the priestesses of
Ceres are allowed the privilege of witnessing that exhibition
XIII  Amongst the spectacles presented by him the solemn entrance of
Tiridates 574 into the city deserves to be mentioned  This personage
who was king of Armenia he invited to Rome by very liberal promises
But being prevented by unfavourable weather from showing him to the
people upon the day fixed by proclamation he took the first opportunity
which occurred several cohorts being drawn up under arms about the
temples in the forum while he was seated on a curule chair on the
rostra in a triumphal dress amidst the military standards and ensigns
Upon Tiridates advancing towards him on a stage made shelving for the
purpose he permitted him to throw himself at his feet but quickly
raised him with his right hand and kissed him  The emperor then at the
kings request took the turban from his head and replaced it by a
crown whilst a person of pretorian rank proclaimed in Latin the words in
which the prince addressed the emperor as a suppliant  After this
ceremony the king was conducted to the theatre where after renewing
his obeisance Nero seated him on his right hand  Being then greeted by
universal acclamation with the title of Emperor and sending his laurel
crown to the Capitol Nero shut the temple of the twofaced Janus as
though there now existed no war throughout the Roman empire
XIV  He filled the consulship four times 575 the first for two
months the second and last for six and the third for four the two
intermediate ones he held successively but the others after an interval
of some years between them
XV  In the administration of justice he scarcely ever gave his decision
on the pleadings before the next day and then in writing  His manner of
hearing causes was not to allow any adjournment but to dispatch them in
order as they stood  When he withdrew to consult his assessors he did
not debate the matter openly with them but silently and privately
reading over their opinions which they gave separately in writing 347
he pronounced sentence from the tribunal according to his own view of the
case as if it was the opinion of the majority  For a long time he would
not admit the sons of freedmen into the senate and those who had been
admitted by former princes he excluded from all public offices  To
supernumerary candidates he gave command in the legions to comfort them
under the delay of their hopes  The consulship he commonly conferred for
six months and one of the two consuls dying a little before the first of
January he substituted no one in his place disliking what had been
formerly done for Caninius Rebilus on such an occasion who was consul
for one day only  He allowed the triumphal honours only to those who
were of quaestorian rank and to some of the equestrian order and
bestowed them without regard to military service  And instead of the
quaestors whose office it properly was he frequently ordered that the
addresses which he sent to the senate on certain occasions should be
read by the consuls
XVI  He devised a new style of building in the city ordering piazzas to
be erected before all houses both in the streets and detached to give
facilities from their terraces in case of fire for preventing it from
spreading and these he built at his own expense  He likewise designed
to extend the city walls as far as Ostia and bring the sea from thence
by a canal into the old city  Many severe regulations and new orders
were made in his time  A sumptuary law was enacted  Public suppers were
limited to the Sportulae 576 and victuallinghouses restrained from
selling any dressed victuals except pulse and herbs whereas before they
sold all kinds of meat  He likewise inflicted punishments on the
Christians a sort of people who held a new and impious 577
superstition
348 He forbad the revels of the charioteers who had long assumed a
licence to stroll about and established for themselves a kind of
prescriptive right to cheat and thieve making a jest of it  The
partisans of the rival theatrical performers were banished as well as
the actors themselves
XVII  To prevent forgery a method was then first invented of having
writings bored run through three times with a thread and then sealed
It was likewise provided that in wills the two first pages with only
the testators name upon them should be presented blank to those who
were to sign them as witnesses and that no one who wrote a will for
another should insert any legacy for himself  It was likewise ordained
that clients should pay their advocates a certain reasonable fee but
nothing for the court which was to be gratuitous the charges for it
being paid out of the public treasury that causes the cognizance of
which before belonged to the judges of the exchequer should be
transferred to the forum and the ordinary tribunals and that all
appeals from the judges should be made to the senate
XVIII  He never entertained the least ambition or hope of augmenting and
extending the frontiers of the empire  On the contrary he had thoughts
of withdrawing the troops from Britain and was only restrained from so
doing by the fear of appearing to detract from the glory of his father
578  All 349 that he did was to reduce the kingdom of Pontus which
was ceded to him by Polemon and also the Alps 579 upon the death of
Cottius into the form of a province
XIX  Twice only he undertook any foreign expeditions one to Alexandria
and the other to Achaia but he abandoned the prosecution of the former
on the very day fixed for his departure by being deterred both by ill
omens and the hazard of the voyage  For while he was making the circuit
of the temples having seated himself in that of Vesta when he attempted
to rise the skirt of his robe stuck fast and he was instantly seized
with such a dimness in his eyes that he could not see a yard before him
In Achaia he attempted to make a cut through the Isthmus 580 and
having made a speech encouraging his pretorians to set about the work on
a signal given by sound of trumpet he first broke ground with a spade
and carried off a basket full of earth upon his shoulders  He made
preparations for an expedition to the Pass of the Caspian mountains
581 forming a new legion out of his late levies in Italy of men all
six feet high which he called the phalanx of Alexander the Great  These
transactions in part unexceptionable and in part highly commendable I
have brought into one view in order to separate them from the scandalous
and criminal part of his conduct of which I shall now give an account
XX  Among the other liberal arts which he was taught in his youth he
was instructed in music and immediately after 350 his advancement to
the empire he sent for Terpnus a performer upon the harp 582 who
flourished at that time with the highest reputation  Sitting with him
for several days following as he sang and played after supper until
late at night he began by degrees to practise upon the instrument
himself  Nor did he omit any of those expedients which artists in music
adopt for the preservation and improvement of their voices  He would
lie upon his back with a sheet of lead upon his breast clear his stomach
and bowels by vomits and clysters and forbear the eating of fruits or
food prejudicial to the voice  Encouraged by his proficiency though his
voice was naturally neither loud nor clear he was desirous of appearing
upon the stage frequently repeating amongst his friends a Greek proverb
to this effect that no one had any regard for music which they never
heard  Accordingly he made his first public appearance at Naples and
although the theatre quivered with the sudden shock of an earthquake he
did not desist until he had finished the piece of music he had begun
He played and sung in the same place several times and for several days
together taking only now and then a little respite to refresh his voice
Impatient of retirement it was his custom to go from the bath to the
theatre and after dining in the orchestra amidst a crowded assembly of
the people he promised them in Greek 583 that after he had drank a
little he would give them a tune which would make their ears tingle
Being highly pleased with the songs that were sung in his praise by some
Alexandrians belonging to the fleet just arrived at Naples 584 he sent
for more of the like singers from Alexandria  At the same time he chose
young men of the equestrian order and above five thousand robust young
fellows from the common people on purpose to learn various kinds of
applause called bombi imbrices and testae 585 which they were to
practise in his favour whenever he performed  They were 351 divided
into several parties and were remarkable for their fine heads of hair
and were extremely well dressed with rings upon their left hands  The
leaders of these bands had salaries of forty thousand sesterces allowed
them
XXI  At Rome also being extremely proud of his singing he ordered the
games called Neronia to be celebrated before the time fixed for their
return  All now becoming importunate to hear his heavenly voice he
informed them that he would gratify those who desired it at the
gardens  But the soldiers then on guard seconding the voice of the
people he promised to comply with their request immediately and with
all his heart  He instantly ordered his name to be entered upon the list
of musicians who proposed to contend and having thrown his lot into the
urn among the rest took his turn and entered attended by the prefects
of the pretorian cohorts bearing his harp and followed by the military
tribunes and several of his intimate friends  After he had taken his
station and made the usual prelude he commanded Cluvius Rufus a man of
consular rank to proclaim in the theatre that he intended to sing the
story of Niobe  This he accordingly did and continued it until nearly
ten oclock but deferred the disposal of the crown and the remaining
part of the solemnity until the next year that he might have more
frequent opportunities of performing  But that being too long he could
not refrain from often appearing as a public performer during the
interval  He made no scruple of exhibiting on the stage even in the
spectacles presented to the people by private persons and was offered by
one of the praetors no less than a million of sesterces for his
services  He likewise sang tragedies in a mask the visors of the heroes
and gods as also of the heroines and goddesses being formed into a
resemblance of his own face and that of any woman he was in love with
Amongst the rest he sung Canace in Labour 586 Orestes the Murderer
of his Mother Oedipus 352 Blinded and Hercules Mad  In the last
tragedy it is said that a young sentinel posted at the entrance of the
stage seeing him in a prison dress and bound with fetters as the fable
of the play required ran to his assistance
XXII  He had from his childhood an extravagant passion for horses and
his constant talk was of the Circensian races notwithstanding it was
prohibited him  Lamenting once among his fellowpupils the case of a
charioteer of the green party who was dragged round the circus at the
tail of his chariot and being reprimanded by his tutor for it he
pretended that he was talking of Hector  In the beginning of his reign
he used to amuse himself daily with chariots drawn by four horses made
of ivory upon a table  He attended at all the lesser exhibitions in the
circus at first privately but at last openly so that nobody ever
doubted of his presence on any particular day  Nor did he conceal his
desire to have the number of the prizes doubled so that the races being
increased accordingly the diversion continued until a late hour the
leaders of parties refusing now to bring out their companies for any time
less than the whole day  Upon this he took a fancy for driving the
chariot himself and that even publicly  Having made his first
experiment in the gardens amidst crowds of slaves and other rabble he
at length performed in the view of all the people in the Circus Maximus
whilst one of his freedmen dropped the napkin in the place where the
magistrates used to give the signal  Not satisfied with exhibiting
various specimens of his skill in those arts at Rome he went over to
Achaia as has been already said principally for this purpose  The
several cities in which solemn trials of musical skill used to be
publicly held had resolved to send him the crowns belonging to those who
bore away the prize  These he accepted so graciously that he not only
gave the deputies who brought them an immediate audience but even
invited them to his table  Being requested by some of them to sing at
supper and prodigiously applauded he said the Greeks were the only
people who has an ear for music and were the only good judges of him and
his attainments  Without delay he commenced his journey and on his
arrival at Cassiope 587 352 exhibited his first musical performance
before the altar of Jupiter Cassius
XXIII  He afterwards appeared at the celebration of all public games in
Greece for such as fell in different years he brought within the
compass of one and some he ordered to be celebrated a second time in the
same year  At Olympia likewise contrary to custom he appointed a
public performance in music and that he might meet with no interruption
in this employment when he was informed by his freedman Helius that
affairs at Rome required his presence he wrote to him in these words
Though now all your hopes and wishes are for my speedy return yet you
ought rather to advise and hope that I may come back with a character
worthy of Nero  During the time of his musical performance nobody was
allowed to stir out of the theatre upon any account however necessary
insomuch that it is said some women with child were delivered there
Many of the spectators being quite wearied with hearing and applauding
him because the town gates were shut slipped privately over the walls
or counterfeiting themselves dead were carried out for their funeral
With what extreme anxiety he engaged in these contests with what keen
desire to bear away the prize and with how much awe of the judges is
scarcely to be believed  As if his adversaries had been on a level with
himself he would watch them narrowly defame them privately and
sometimes upon meeting them rail at them in very scurrilous language
or bribe them if they were better performers than himself  He always
addressed the judges with the most profound reverence before he began
telling them he had done all things that were necessary by way of
preparation but that the issue of the approaching trial was in the hand
of fortune and that they as wise and skilful men ought to exclude from
their judgment things merely accidental  Upon their encouraging him to
have a good heart he went off with more assurance but not entirely free
from anxiety interpreting the silence and modesty of some of them into
sourness and illnature and saying that he was suspicious of them
XXIV  In these contests he adhered so strictly to the rules 354 that
he never durst spit nor wipe the sweat from his forehead in any other
way than with his sleeve  Having in the performance of a tragedy
dropped his sceptre and not quickly recovering it he was in a great
fright lest he should be set aside for the miscarriage and could not
regain his assurance until an actor who stood by swore he was certain it
had not been observed in the midst of the acclamations and exultations of
the people  When the prize was adjudged to him he always proclaimed it
himself and even entered the lists with the heralds  That no memory or
the least monument might remain of any other victor in the sacred Grecian
games he ordered all their statues and pictures to be pulled down
dragged away with hooks and thrown into the common sewers  He drove the
chariot with various numbers of horses and at the Olympic games with no
fewer than ten though in a poem of his he had reflected upon
Mithridates for that innovation  Being thrown out of his chariot he was
again replaced but could not retain his seat and was obliged to give
up before he reached the goal but was crowned notwithstanding  On his
departure he declared the whole province a free country and conferred
upon the judges in the several games the freedom of Rome with large sums
of money  All these favours he proclaimed himself with his own voice
from the middle of the Stadium during the solemnity of the Isthmian
games
XXV  On his return from Greece arriving at Naples because he had
commenced his career as a public performer in that city he made his
entrance in a chariot drawn by white horses through a breach in the
citywall according to the practice of those who were victorious in the
sacred Grecian games  In the same manner he entered Antium Alba and
Rome  He made his entry into the city riding in the same chariot in
which Augustus had triumphed in a purple tunic and a cloak embroidered
with golden stars having on his head the crown won at Olympia and in
his right hand that which was given him at the Parthian games the rest
being carried in a procession before him with inscriptions denoting the
places where they had been won from whom and in what plays or musical
performances whilst a train followed him with loud acclamations crying
out that they 355 were the emperors attendants and the soldiers of
his triumph  Having then caused an arch of the Circus Maximus 588 to
be taken down he passed through the breach as also through the Velabrum
589 and the forum to the Palatine hill and the temple of Apollo
Everywhere as he marched along victims were slain whilst the streets
were strewed with saffron and birds chaplets and sweetmeats scattered
abroad  He suspended the sacred crowns in his chamber about his beds
and caused statues of himself to be erected in the attire of a harper
and had his likeness stamped upon the coin in the same dress  After this
period he was so far from abating any thing of his application to music
that for the preservation of his voice he never addressed the soldiers
but by messages or with some person to deliver his speeches for him
when he thought fit to make his appearance amongst them  Nor did he ever
do any thing either in jest or earnest without a voicemaster standing
by him to caution him against overstraining his vocal organs and to
apply a handkerchief to his mouth when he did  He offered his
friendship or avowed 356 open enmity to many according as they were
lavish or sparing in giving him their applause
XXVI  Petulancy lewdness luxury avarice and cruelty he practised at
first with reserve and in private as if prompted to them only by the
folly of youth but even then the world was of opinion that they were
the faults of his nature and not of his age  After it was dark he used
to enter the taverns disguised in a cap or a wig and ramble about the
streets in sport which was not void of mischief  He used to beat those
he met coming home from supper and if they made any resistance would
wound them and throw them into the common sewer  He broke open and
robbed shops establishing an auction at home for selling his booty  In
the scuffles which took place on those occasions he often ran the hazard
of losing his eyes and even his life being beaten almost to death by a
senator for handling his wife indecently  After this adventure he
never again ventured abroad at that time of night without some tribunes
