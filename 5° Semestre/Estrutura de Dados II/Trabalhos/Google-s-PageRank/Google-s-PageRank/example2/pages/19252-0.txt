PART ONE EXCERPTS FROM THE WILL AND TESTAMENT OF aABDUaLBAHA
aAllpraise to Him Who by the Shield of His Covenant hatha
Allpraise to Him Who by the Shield of His Covenant hath guarded the
Temple of His Cause from the darts of doubtfulness Who by the Hosts of
His Testament hath preserved the Sanctuary of His Most Beneficent Law and
protected His Straight and Luminous Path staying thereby the onslaught of
the company of Covenantbreakers that have threatened to subvert His
Divine Edifice Who hath watched over His Mighty Stronghold and
Allglorious Faith through the aid of men whom the slander of the
slanderer affects not whom no earthly calling glory and power can turn
aside from the Covenant of God and His Testament established firmly by
His clear and manifest words writ and revealed by His Allglorious Pen
and recorded in the Preserved Tablet
Salutation and praise blessing and glory rest upon that primal branch of
the Divine and Sacred LoteTree grown out blest tender verdant and
flourishing from the Twin Holy Trees the most wondrous unique and
priceless pearl that doth gleam from out the twin surging seas upon the
offshoots of the Tree of Holiness the twigs of the Celestial Tree they
that in the Day of the Great Dividing have stood fast and firm in the
Covenant upon the Hands pillars of the Cause of God that have diffused
widely the Divine Fragrances declared His Proofs proclaimed His Faith
published abroad His Law detached themselves from all things but Him
stood for righteousness in this world and kindled the Fire of the Love of
God in the very hearts and souls of His servants upon them that have
believed rested assured stood steadfast in His Covenant and followed the
Light that after my passing shineth from the Dayspring of Divine
Guidanceafor behold he is the blest and sacred bough that hath branched
out from the Twin Holy Trees Well is it with him that seeketh the shelter
of his shade that shadoweth all mankind
aO ye beloved of the Lord The greatest of all things is thea
O ye beloved of the Lord The greatest of all things is the protection of
the True Faith of God the preservation of His Law the safeguarding of
His Cause and service unto His Word Ten thousand souls have shed streams
of their sacred blood in this path their precious lives they offered in
sacrifice unto Him hastened wrapt in holy ecstasy unto the glorious field
of martyrdom upraised the Standard of Godas Faith and writ with their
lifeblood upon the Tablet of the world the verses of His Divine Unity
The sacred breast of His Holiness the Exalted One may my life be a
sacrifice unto Him was made a target to many a dart of woe and in
MazandarAn the Blessed feet of the AbhA Beauty may my life be offered up
for His loved ones were so grievously scourged as to bleed and be sore
wounded His neck also was put into captive chains and His feet made fast
in the stocks In every hour for a period of fifty years a new trial and
calamity befell Him and fresh afflictions and cares beset Him One of
them after having suffered intense vicissitudes He was made homeless and
a wanderer and fell a victim to still new vexations and troubles In
aIrAq the DayStar of the world was so exposed to the wiles of the people
of malice as to be eclipsed in splendor Later on He was sent an exile to
the Great City Constantinople and thence to the Land of Mystery
Adrianople whence grievously wronged He was eventually transferred to
the Most Great Prison AkkA He Whom the world hath wronged may my life
be offered for His loved ones was four times banished from city to city
till at last condemned to perpetual confinement He was incarcerated in
this Prison the prison of highway robbers of brigands and of manslayers
All this is but one of the trials that have afflicted the Blessed Beauty
the rest being even as grievous as this
aAccording to the direct and sacred command of God we area
According to the direct and sacred command of God we are forbidden to
utter slander are commanded to show forth peace and amity are exhorted
to rectitude of conduct straightforwardness and harmony with all the
kindreds and peoples of the world We must obey and be the wellwishers of
the governments of the land regard disloyalty unto a just king as
disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a
transgression of the Cause of God
aO God my God Thou seest this wronged servant of Thinea
O God my God Thou seest this wronged servant of Thine held fast in the
talons of ferocious lions of ravening wolves of bloodthirsty beasts
Graciously assist me through my love for Thee that I may drink deep of
the chalice that brimmeth over with faithfulness to Thee and is filled
with Thy bountiful Grace so that fallen upon the dust I may sink
prostrate and senseless whilst my vesture is dyed crimson with my blood
This is my wish my heartas desire my hope my pride my glory Grant O
Lord my God and my Refuge that in my last hour my end may even as musk
shed its fragrance of glory Is there a bounty greater than this Nay by
Thy Glory I call Thee to witness that no day passeth but that I quaff my
fill from this cup so grievous are the misdeeds wrought by them that have
broken the Covenant kindled discord showed their malice stirred
sedition in the land and dishonored Thee amidst Thy servants Lord Shield
Thou from these Covenantbreakers the mighty Stronghold of Thy Faith and
protect Thy secret Sanctuary from the onslaught of the ungodly Thou art
in truth the Mighty the Powerful the Gracious the Strong
aO God my God Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils ofa
O God my God Shield Thy trusted servants from the evils of self and
passion protect them with the watchful eye of Thy loving kindness from
all rancour hate and envy shelter them in the impregnable stronghold of
Thy Cause and safe from the darts of doubtfulness make them the
manifestations of Thy glorious Signs illumine their faces with the
effulgent rays shed from the Dayspring of Thy Divine Unity gladden their
hearts with the verses revealed from Thy Holy Kingdom strengthen their
loins by Thy allswaying power that cometh from Thy Realm of Glory Thou
art the Allbountiful the Protector the Almighty the Gracious
O ye that stand fast in the Covenant When the hour cometh that this
wronged and broken winged bird will have taken its flight unto the
celestial concourse when it will have hastened to the Realm of the Unseen
and its mortal frame will have been either lost or hidden neath the dust
it is incumbent upon the AfnAn that are steadfast in the Covenant of God
and have branched from the Tree of Holiness the Hands pillars of the
Cause of God the glory of the Lord rest upon them and all the friends
and loved ones one and all to bestir themselves and arise with heart and
soul and in one accord to diffuse the sweet savors of God to teach His
Cause and to promote His Faith It behooveth them not to rest for a
moment neither to seek repose They must disperse themselves in every
land pass by every clime and travel throughout all regions Bestirred
without rest and steadfast to the end they must raise in every land the
triumphal cry aO Thou the Glory of Gloriesa YABahAaualAbhA must
achieve renown in the world wherever they go must burn brightly even as a
candle in every meeting and must kindle the flame of Divine love in every
assembly that the light of truth may rise resplendent in the midmost
heart of the world that throughout the East and throughout the West a
vast concourse may gather under the shadow of the Word of God that the
sweet savors of holiness may be diffused that faces may shine radiantly
hearts be filled with the Divine spirit and souls be made heavenly
In these days the most important of all things is the guidance of the
nations and peoples of the world Teaching the Cause is of utmost
importance for it is the head cornerstone of the foundation itself This
wronged servant has spent his days and night in promoting the Cause and
urging the peoples to service He rested not a moment till the fame of
the Cause of God was noised abroad in the world and the celestial strains
from the AbhA Kingdom roused the East and the West The beloved of God
must also follow the same example This is the secret of faithfulness
this is the requirement of servitude to the Threshold of BahA
The disciples of Christ forgot themselves and all earthly things forsook
all their cares and belongings purged themselves of self and passion and
with absolute detachment scattered far and wide and engaged in calling the
peoples of the world to the Divine Guidance till at last they made the
world another world illumined the surface of the earth and even to their
last hour proved selfsacrificing in the pathway of that Beloved One of
God Finally in various lands they suffered glorious martyrdom Let them
that are men of action follow in their footsteps
O my loving friends After the passing away of this wronged one it is
incumbent upon the AghsAn Branches the AfnAn Twigs of the Sacred
LoteTree the Hands pillars of the Cause of God and the loved ones of
the AbhA Beauty to turn unto Shoghi Effendiathe youthful branch branched
from the two hallowed and sacred LoteTrees and the fruit grown from the
union of the two offshoots of the Tree of Holinessaas he is the sign of
God the chosen branch the guardian of the Cause of God he unto whom all
the AghsAn the AfnAn the Hands of the Cause of God and His loved ones
must turn He is the expounder of the words of God and after him will
succeed the firstborn of his lineal descendants
The sacred and youthful branch the guardian of the Cause of God as well
as the Universal House of Justice to be universally elected and
established are both under the care and protection of the AbhA Beauty
under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness the Exalted One
may my life be offered up for them both Whatsoever they decide is of
God Whoso obeyeth him not neither obeyeth them hath not obeyed God
whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God
whoso opposeth him hath opposed God whoso contendeth with them hath
contended with God whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God whoso
denieth him hath denied God whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in
God whoso deviateth separateth himself and turneth aside from him hath
in truth deviated separated himself and turned aside from God May the
wrath the fierce indignation the vengeance of God rest upon him The
mighty stronghold shall remain impregnable and safe through obedience to
him who is the guardian of the Cause of God It is incumbent upon the
members of the House of Justice upon all the AghsAn the AfnAn the
Hands of the Cause of God to show their obedience submissiveness and
subordination unto the guardian of the Cause of God to turn unto him and
be lowly before him He that opposeth him hath opposed the True One will
make a breach in the Cause of God will subvert His word and will become a
manifestation of the Center of Sedition Beware beware lest the days
after the ascension of BahAauallAh be repeated when the Center of
Sedition waxed haughty and rebellious and with Divine Unity for his excuse
deprived himself and perturbed and poisoned others No doubt every
vainglorious one that purposeth dissension and discord will not openly
declare his evil purposes nay rather even as impure gold would he seize
upon divers measures and various pretexts that he may separate the
gathering of the people of BahA My object is to show that the Hands of
the Cause of God must be ever watchful and so soon as they find anyone
beginning to oppose and protest against the guardian of the Cause of God
cast him out from the congregation of the people of BahA and in no wise
accept any excuse from him How often hath grievous error been disguised
in the garb of truth that it might sow the seeds of doubt in the hearts
of men
O ye beloved of the Lord It is incumbent upon the guardian of the Cause
of God to appoint in his own lifetime him that shall become his
successor that differences may not arise after his passing He that is
appointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things
must be the essence of purity must show in himself the fear of God
knowledge wisdom and learning Thus should the firstborn of the
guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the
wordsaaThe child is the secret essence of its sirea that is should he
not inherit of the spiritual within him the guardian of the Cause of God
and his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly character then must
he the guardian of the Cause of God choose another branch to succeed
him
The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine
persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in
the work of the guardian of the Cause of God The election of these nine
must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company of the
Hands of the Cause of God and these whether unanimously or by a majority
vote must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the guardian of
the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor This assent must be given
in such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be
distinguished secret ballot
O friends The Hands of the Cause of God must be nominated and appointed
by the guardian of the Cause of God All must be under his shadow and obey
his command Should any within or without the company of the Hands of the
Cause of God disobey and seek division the wrath of God and His vengeance
will be upon him for he will have caused a breach in the true Faith of
God
The obligations of the Hands of the Cause of God are to diffuse the Divine
Fragrances to edify the souls of men to promote learning to improve the
character of all men and to be at all times and under all conditions
sanctified and detached from earthly things They must manifest the fear
of God by their conduct their manners their deeds and their words
This body of the Hands of the Cause of God is under the direction of the
guardian of the Cause of God He must continually urge them to strive and
endeavor to the utmost of their ability to diffuse the sweet savors of
God and to guide all the peoples of the world for it is the light of
Divine Guidance that causeth all the universe to be illumined To
disregard though it be for a moment this absolute command which is
binding upon everyone is in no wise permitted that the existent world
may become even as the AbhA Paradise that the surface of the earth may
become heavenly that contention and conflict amidst peoples kindreds
nations and governments may disappear that all the dwellers on earth may
become one people and one race that the world may become even as one
home Should differences arise they shall be amicably and conclusively
settled by the Supreme Tribunal that shall include members from all the
governments and peoples of the world
O ye beloved of the Lord In this sacred Dispensation conflict and
contention are in no wise permitted Every aggressor deprives himself of
Godas grace It is incumbent upon everyone to show the utmost love
rectitude of conduct straightforwardness and sincere kindliness unto all
the peoples and kindreds of the world be they friends or strangers So
intense must be the spirit of love and lovingkindness that the stranger
may find himself a friend the enemy a true brother no difference
whatsoever existing between them For universality is of God and all
limitations earthly Thus man must strive that his reality may manifest
virtues and perfections the light whereof may shine upon everyone The
light of the sun shineth upon all the world and the merciful showers of
Divine Providence fall upon all peoples The vivifying breeze reviveth
every living creature and all beings endued with life obtain their share
and portion at His heavenly board In like manner the affections and
lovingkindness of the servants of the One True God must be bountifully
and universally extended to all mankind Regarding this restrictions and
limitations are in no wise permitted
Wherefore O my loving friends Consort with all the peoples kindreds and
religions of the world with the utmost truthfulness uprightness
faithfulness kindliness goodwill and friendliness that all the world
of being may be filled with the holy ecstasy of the grace of BahA that
ignorance enmity hate and rancor may vanish from the world and the
darkness of estrangement amidst the peoples and kindreds of the world may
give way to the Light of Unity Should other peoples and nations be
unfaithful to you show your fidelity unto them should they be unjust
toward you show justice towards them should they keep aloof from you
attract them to yourself should they show their enmity be friendly
towards them should they poison your lives sweeten their souls should
they inflict a wound upon you be a salve to their sores Such are the
attributes of the sincere Such are the attributes of the truthful
And now concerning the House of Justice which God hath ordained as the
source of all good and freed from all error it must be elected by
universal suffrage that is by the believers Its members must be
manifestations of the fear of God and daysprings of knowledge and
understanding must be steadfast in Godas faith and the wellwishers of
all mankind By this House is meant the Universal House of Justice that
is in all countries a secondary House of Justice must be instituted and
these secondary Houses of Justice must elect the members of the Universal
one Unto this body all things must be referred It enacteth all
ordinances and regulations that are not to be found in the explicit Holy
Text By this body all the difficult problems are to be resolved and the
guardian of the Cause of God is its sacred head and the distinguished
member for life of that body Should he not attend in person its
deliberations he must appoint one to represent him Should any of the
members commit a sin injurious to the common weal the guardian of the
Cause of God hath at his own discretion the right to expel him whereupon
the people must elect another one in his stead
aO ye beloved of the Lord It is incumbent upon you to be submissivea
O ye beloved of the Lord It is incumbent upon you to be submissive to all
monarchs that are just and show your fidelity to every righteous king
Serve ye the sovereigns of the world with utmost truthfulness and loyalty
Show obedience unto them and be their wellwishers Without their leave
and permission do not meddle with political affairs for disloyalty to the
just sovereign is disloyalty to God himself
This is my counsel and the commandment of God unto you Well is it with
them that act accordingly
aBy the Ancient Beauty This wronged one hath in no wisea
By the Ancient Beauty This wronged one hath in no wise borne nor doth he
bear a grudge against any one towards none doth he entertain any
illfeeling and uttereth no word save for the good of the world My
supreme obligation however of necessity prompteth me to guard and
preserve the Cause of God Thus with the greatest regret I counsel you
sayingaaGuard ye the Cause of God protect His law and have the utmost
fear of discord This is the foundation of the belief of the people of
BahA may my life be offered up for them aHis Holiness the Exalted One
the BAb is the Manifestation of the Unity and Oneness of God and the
Forerunner of the Ancient Beauty His Holiness the AbhA Beauty may my
life be a sacrifice for His steadfast friends is the Supreme
Manifestation of God and the Dayspring of His Most Divine Essence All
others are servants unto Him and do His biddinga Unto the Most Holy Book
every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be
referred to the Universal House of Justice That which this body whether
unanimously or by a majority doth carry that is verily the Truth and the
Purpose of God himself Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them
that love discord hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord
of the Covenant By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice
which is to be elected from all countries that is from those parts in
the East and West where the loved ones are to be found after the manner
of the customary elections in Western countries such as those of England
aO ye beloved of the Lord Strive with all your heart to shielda
O ye beloved of the Lord Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause
of God from the onslaught of the insincere for souls such as these cause
the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce
contrary results
O God my God I call Thee Thy Prophets and Thy Messengers Thy Saints
and Thy Holy Ones to witness that I have declared conclusively Thy Proofs
unto Thy loved ones and set forth clearly all things unto them that they
may watch over Thy Faith guard Thy Straight Path and protect Thy
Resplendent Law Thou art verily the Allknowing the Allwise
aWhosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance toa
Whosoever and whatsoever meeting becometh a hindrance to the diffusion of
the Light of Faith let the loved ones give them counsel and say aOf all
the gifts of God the greatest is the gift of Teaching It draweth unto us
the Grace of God and is our first obligation Of such a gift how can we
deprive ourselves Nay our lives our goods our comforts our rest we
offer them all as a sacrifice for the AbhA Beauty and teach the Cause of
Goda Caution and prudence however must be observed even as recorded in
the Book The veil must in no wise be suddenly rent asunder The Glory of
Glories rest upon you
O ye the faithful loved ones of aAbdualBahA It is incumbent upon you to
take the greatest care of Shoghi Effendi the twig that hath branched from
the fruit given forth by the two hallowed and Divine LoteTrees that no
dust of despondency and sorrow may stain his radiant nature that day by
day he may wax greater in happiness in joy and spirituality and may grow
to become even as a fruitful tree
For he is after aAbdualBahA the guardian of the Cause of God the
AfnAn the Hands pillars of the Cause and the beloved of the Lord must
obey him and turn unto him He that obeyeth him not hath not obeyed God
he that turneth away from him hath turned away from God and he that
denieth him hath denied the True One Beware lest anyone falsely
interpret these words and like unto them that have broken the Covenant
after the Day of Ascension of BahAauallAh advance a pretext raise the
standard of revolt wax stubborn and open wide the door of false
interpretation To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or
express his particular convictions All must seek guidance and turn unto
the Center of the Cause and the House of Justice And he that turneth unto
whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error
The Glory of Glories rest upon you

GUARDIAN OF THE BAHAaA CAUSE

Letter of January 21st 1922
Dearly beloved brethren and sisters in aAbdualBahA
At this early hour when the morning light is just breaking upon the Holy
Land whilst the gloom of the dear Masteras bereavement is still hanging
thick upon the hearts I feel as if my soul turns in yearning love and
full of hope to that great company of His loved ones across the seas who
