and can tell us how he came to feel this or to say that But a man
like Browning knows no more about the state of his emotions than about
the state of his pulse they are things greater than he things
growing at will like forces of Nature There is an old anecdote
probably apocryphal which describes how a feminine admirer wrote to
Browning asking him for the meaning of one of his darker poems and
received the following reply When that poem was written two people
knew what it meantGod and Robert Browning And now God only knows
what it means This story gives in all probability an entirely
false impression of Brownings attitude towards his work He was a
keen artist a keen scholar he could put his finger on anything and
he had a memory like the British Museum Library But the story does
in all probability give a tolerably accurate picture of Brownings
attitude towards his own emotions and his psychological type If a man
had asked him what some particular allusion to a Persian hero meant he
could in all probability have quoted half the epic if a man had asked
him which third cousin of Charlemagne was alluded to in Sordello he
could have given an account of the man and an account of his father
and his grandfather But if a man had asked him what he thought of
himself or what were his emotions an hour before his wedding he
would have replied with perfect sincerity that God alone knew
This mystery of the unconscious man far deeper than any mystery of
the conscious one existing as it does in all men existed peculiarly
in Browning because he was a very ordinary and spontaneous man The
same thing exists to some extent in all history and all affairs
Anything that is deliberate twisted created as a trap and a
mystery must be discovered at last everything that is done naturally
remains mysterious It may be difficult to discover the principles of
the Rosicrucians but it is much easier to discover the principles of
the Rosicrucians than the principles of the United States nor has any
secret society kept its aims so quiet as humanity The way to be
inexplicable is to be chaotic and on the surface this was the quality
of Brownings life there is the same difference between judging of
his poetry and judging of his life that there is between making a map
of a labyrinth and making a map of a mist The discussion of what some
particular allusion in Sordello means has gone on so far and may go
on still but it has it in its nature to end The life of Robert
Browning who combines the greatest brain with the most simple
temperament known in our annals would go on for ever if we did not
decide to summarise it in a very brief and simple narrative
Robert Browning was born in Camberwell on May 7th 1812 His father and
grandfather had been clerks in the Bank of England and his whole
family would appear to have belonged to the solid and educated middle
classthe class which is interested in letters but not ambitious in
them the class to which poetry is a luxury but not a necessity
This actual quality and character of the Browning family shows some
tendency to be obscured by matters more remote It is the custom of
all biographers to seek for the earliest traces of a family in distant
ages and even in distant lands and Browning as it happens has given
them opportunities which tend to lead away the mind from the main
matter in hand There is a tradition for example that men of his
name were prominent in the feudal ages it is based upon little beyond
a coincidence of surnames and the fact that Browning used a seal with
a coatofarms Thousands of middleclass men use such a seal merely
because it is a curiosity or a legacy without knowing or caring
anything about the condition of their ancestors in the Middle Ages
Then again there is a theory that he was of Jewish blood a view
which is perfectly conceivable and which Browning would have been the
last to have thought derogatory but for which as a matter of fact
there is exceedingly little evidence The chief reason assigned by his
contemporaries for the belief was the fact that he was without doubt
specially and profoundly interested in Jewish matters This
suggestion worthless in any case would if anything tell the other
way For while an Englishman may be enthusiastic about England or
indignant against England it never occurred to any living Englishman
to be interested in England Browning was like every other
intelligent Aryan interested in the Jews but if he was related to
every people in which he was interested he must have been of
extraordinarily mixed extraction Thirdly there is the yet more
sensational theory that there was in Robert Browning a strain of the
negro The supporters of this hypothesis seem to have little in
reality to say except that Brownings grandmother was certainly a
Creole It is said in support of the view that Browning was singularly
dark in early life and was often mistaken for an Italian There does
not however seem to be anything particular to be deduced from this
except that if he looked like an Italian he must have looked
exceedingly unlike a negro
There is nothing valid against any of these three theories just as
there is nothing valid in their favour they may any or all of them
be true but they are still irrelevant They are something that is in
history or biography a great deal worse than being falsethey are
misleading We do not want to know about a man like Browning whether
he had a right to a shield used in the Wars of the Roses or whether
the tenth grandfather of his Creole grandmother had been white or
black we want to know something about his family which is quite a
different thing We wish to have about Browning not so much the kind
of information which would satisfy Clarencieux KingatArms but the
sort of information which would satisfy us if we were advertising for
a very confidential secretary or a very private tutor We should not
be concerned as to whether the tutor were descended from an Irish
king but we should still be really concerned about his extraction
about what manner of people his had been for the last two or three
generations This is the most practical duty of biography and this is
also the most difficult It is a great deal easier to hunt a family
from tombstone to tombstone back to the time of Henry II than to
catch and realise and put upon paper that most nameless and elusive of
all thingssocial tone
It will be said immediately and must as promptly be admitted that we
could find a biographical significance in any of these theories if we
looked for it But it is indeed the sin and snare of biographers
that they tend to see significance in everything characteristic
carelessness if their hero drops his pipe and characteristic
carefulness if he picks it up again It is true assuredly that all
the three races above named could be connected with Brownings
personality If we believed for instance that he really came of a
race of medival barons we should say at once that from them he got
his preeminent spirit of battle we should be right for every line
in his stubborn soul and his erect body did really express the
fighter he was always contending whether it was with a German theory
about the Gnostics or with a stranger who elbowed his wife in a
crowd Again if we had decided that he was a Jew we should point out
how absorbed he was in the terrible simplicity of monotheism we
should be right for he was so absorbed Or again in the case even of
the negro fancy it would not be difficult for us to suggest a love of
colour a certain mental gaudiness a pleasure
When reds and blues were indeed red and blue
as he says in The Ring and the Book We should be right for there
really was in Browning a tropical violence of taste an artistic
scheme compounded as it were of orchids and cockatoos which amid
our cold English poets seems scarcely European All this is extremely
fascinating and it may be true But as has above been suggested
here comes in the great temptation of this kind of work the noble
temptation to see too much in everything The biographer can easily
see a personal significance in these three hypothetical nationalities
But is there in the world a biographer who could lay his hand upon his
heart and say that he would not have seen as much significance in any
three other nationalities If Brownings ancestors had been Frenchmen
should we not have said that it was from them doubtless that he
inherited that logical agility which marks him among English poets
If his grandfather had been a Swede should we not have said that the
old searoving blood broke out in bold speculation and insatiable
travel If his greataunt had been a Red Indian should we not have
said that only in the Ojibways and the Blackfeet do we find the
Browning fantasticality combined with the Browning stoicism This
overreadiness to seize hints is an inevitable part of that secret
heroworship which is the heart of biography The lover of great men
sees signs of them long before they begin to appear on the earth and
like some old mythological chronicler claims as their heralds the
storms and the falling stars
A certain indulgence must therefore be extended to the present writer
if he declines to follow that admirable veteran of Browning study Dr
Furnivall into the prodigious investigations which he has been
conducting into the condition of the Browning family since the
beginning of the world For his last discovery the descent of
Browning from a footman in the service of a country magnate there
seems to be suggestive though not decisive evidence But Brownings
descent from barons or Jews or lackeys or black men is not the
main point touching his family If the Brownings were of mixed origin
they were so much the more like the great majority of English
middleclass people It is curious that the romance of race should be
spoken of as if it were a thing peculiarly aristocratic that
admiration for rank or interest in family should mean only interest
in one not very interesting type of rank and family The truth is that
aristocrats exhibit less of the romance of pedigree than any other
people in the world For since it is their principle to marry only
within their own class and mode of life there is no opportunity in
their case for any of the more interesting studies in heredity they
exhibit almost the unbroken uniformity of the lower animals It is in
the middle classes that we find the poetry of genealogy it is the
suburban grocer standing at his shop door whom some wild dash of
Eastern or Celtic blood may drive suddenly to a whole holiday or a
crime Let us admit then that it is true that these legends of the
Browning family have every abstract possibility But it is a far more
cogent and apposite truth that if a man had knocked at the door of
every house in the street where Browning was born he would have found
similar legends in all of them There is hardly a family in Camberwell
that has not a story or two about foreign marriages a few generations
back and in all this the Brownings are simply a typical Camberwell
family The real truth about Browning and men like him can scarcely be
better expressed than in the words of that very wise and witty story
Kingsleys Water Babies in which the pedigree of the Professor is
treated in a manner which is an excellent example of the wild common
sense of the book His mother was a Dutch woman and therefore she
was born at Curacoa of course you have read your geography and
therefore know why and his father was a Pole and therefore he was
brought up at Petropaulowski of course you have learnt your modern
politics and therefore know why but for all that he was as thorough
an Englishman as ever coveted his neighbours goods
It may be well therefore to abandon the task of obtaining a clear
account of Brownings family and endeavour to obtain what is much
more important a clear account of his home For the great central
and solid fact which these heraldic speculations tend inevitably to
veil and confuse is that Browning was a thoroughly typical Englishman
of the middle class He may have had alien blood and that alien
blood by the paradox we have observed may have made him more
characteristically a native A phase a fancy a metaphor may or may
not have been born of eastern or southern elements but he was
without any question at all an Englishman of the middle class
Neither all his liberality nor all his learning ever made him anything
but an Englishman of the middle class He expanded his intellectual
tolerance until it included the anarchism of Fifine at the Fair and
the blasphemous theology of Caliban but he remained himself an
Englishman of the middle class He pictured all the passions of the
earth since the Fall from the devouring amorousness of Times
Revenges to the despotic fantasy of Instans Tyrannus but he
remained himself an Englishman of the middle class The moment that he
came in contact with anything that was slovenly anything that was
lawless in actual life something rose up in him older than any
opinions the blood of generations of good men He met George Sand and
her poetical circle and hated it with all the hatred of an old city
merchant for the irresponsible life He met the Spiritualists and
hated them with all the hatred of the middle class for borderlands
and equivocal positions and playing with fire His intellect went upon
bewildering voyages but his soul walked in a straight road He piled
up the fantastic towers of his imagination until they eclipsed the
planets but the plan of the foundation on which he built was always
the plan of an honest English house in Camberwell He abandoned with
a ceaseless intellectual ambition every one of the convictions of his
class but he carried its prejudices into eternity
It is then of Browning as a member of the middle class that we can
speak with the greatest historical certainty and it is his immediate
forebears who present the real interest to us His father Robert
Browning was a man of great delicacy of taste and to all appearance
of an almost exaggerated delicacy of conscience Every glimpse we have
of him suggests that earnest and almost worried kindliness which is
the mark of those to whom selfishness even justifiable selfishness
is really a thing difficult or impossible In early life Robert
Browning senior was placed by his father who was apparently a father
of a somewhat primitive not to say barbaric type in an important
commercial position in the West Indies He threw up the position
however because it involved him in some recognition of slavery
Whereupon his unique parent in a transport of rage not only
disinherited him and flung him out of doors but by a superb stroke of
humour which stands alone in the records of parental ingenuity sent
him in a bill for the cost of his education About the same time that
he was suffering for his moral sensibility he was also disturbed about
religious matters and he completed his severance from his father by
joining a dissenting sect He was in short a very typical example of
the serious middleclass man of the Wilberforce period a man to whom
duty was all in all and who would revolutionise an empire or a
continent for the satisfaction of a single moral scruple Thus while
he was Puritan at the core not the ruthless Puritan of the
seventeenth but the humanitarian Puritan of the eighteenth century
he had upon the surface all the tastes and graces of a man of culture
Numerous accomplishments of the lighter kind such as drawing and
painting in water colours he possessed and his feeling for many
kinds of literature was fastidious and exact But the whole was
absolutely redolent of the polite severity of the eighteenth century
He lamented his sons early admiration for Byron and never ceased
adjuring him to model himself upon Pope
He was in short one of the oldfashioned humanitarians of the
eighteenth century a class which we may or may not have conquered in
moral theory but which we most certainly have not conquered in moral
practice Robert Browning senior destroyed all his fortunes in order
to protest against black slavery white slavery may be as later
economists tell us a thing infinitely worse but not many men destroy
their fortunes in order to protest against it The ideals of the men
of that period appear to us very unattractive to them duty was a kind
of chilly sentiment But when we think what they did with those cold
ideals we can scarcely feel so superior They uprooted the enormous
Upas of slavery the tree that was literally as old as the race of
man They altered the whole face of Europe with their deductive
fancies We have ideals that are really better ideals of passion of
mysticism of a sense of the youth and adventurousness of the earth
but it will be well for us if we achieve as much by our frenzy as they
did by their delicacies It scarcely seems as if we were as robust in
our very robustness as they were robust in their sensibility
Robert Brownings mother was the daughter of William Wiedermann a
German merchant settled in Dundee and married to a Scotch wife One
of the poets principal biographers has suggested that from this union
of the German and Scotch Browning got his metaphysical tendency it
is possible but here again we must beware of the great biographical
danger of making mountains out of molehills What Brownings mother
unquestionably did give to him was in the way of traininga very
strong religious habit and a great belief in manners Thomas Carlyle
called her the type of a Scottish gentlewoman and the phrase has a
very real significance to those who realise the peculiar condition of
Scotland one of the very few European countries where large sections
of the aristocracy are Puritans thus a Scottish gentlewoman combines
two descriptions of dignity at the same time Little more is known of
this lady except the fact that after her death Browning could not bear
to look at places where she had walked
Brownings education in the formal sense reduces itself to a minimum
In very early boyhood he attended a species of dameschool which
according to some of his biographers he had apparently to leave
because he was too clever to be tolerable However this may be he
undoubtedly went afterwards to a school kept by Mr Ready at which
again he was marked chiefly by precocity But the boys education did
not in truth take place at any systematic seat of education it took
place in his own home where one of the quaintest and most learned and
most absurdly indulgent of fathers poured out in an endless stream
fantastic recitals from the Greek epics and medival chronicles If we
test the matter by the test of actual schools and universities
Browning will appear to be almost the least educated man in English
literary history But if we test it by the amount actually learned we
shall think that he was perhaps the most educated man that ever lived
that he was in fact if anything overeducated In a spirited poem he
has himself described how when he was a small child his father used
to pile up chairs in the drawingroom and call them the city of Troy
Browning came out of the home crammed with all kinds of
knowledgeknowledge about the Greek poets knowledge about the
Provencal Troubadours knowledge about the Jewish Rabbis of the Middle
Ages But along with all this knowledge he carried one definite and
important piece of ignorance an ignorance of the degree to which such
knowledge was exceptional He was no spoilt and selfconscious child
taught to regard himself as clever In the atmosphere in which he
lived learning was a pleasure and a natural pleasure like sport or
wine He had in it the pleasure of some old scholar of the Renascence
when grammar itself was as fresh as the flowers of spring He had no
reason to suppose that every one did not join in so admirable a game
His sagacious destiny while giving him knowledge of everything else
left him in ignorance of the ignorance of the world
Of his boyish days scarcely any important trace remains except a kind
of diary which contains under one date the laconic statement Married
two wives this morning The insane ingenuity of the biographer would
be quite capable of seeing in this a most suggestive foreshadowing of
the sexual dualism which is so ably defended in Fifine at the Fair
A great part of his childhood was passed in the society of his only
sister Sariana and it is a curious and touching fact that with her
also he passed his last days From his earliest babyhood he seems to
have lived in a more or less stimulating mental atmosphere but as he
emerged into youth he came under great poetic influences which made
his fathers classical poetic tradition look for the time insipid
Browning began to live in the life of his own age
As a young man he attended classes at University College beyond this
there is little evidence that he was much in touch with intellectual
circles outside that of his own family But the forces that were
moving the literary world had long passed beyond the merely literary
area About the time of Brownings boyhood a very subtle and profound
change was beginning in the intellectual atmosphere of such homes as
that of the Brownings In studying the careers of great men we tend
constantly to forget that their youth was generally passed and their
characters practically formed in a period long previous to their
appearance in history We think of Milton the Restoration Puritan
and forget that he grew up in the living shadow of Shakespeare and the
full summer of the Elizabethan drama We realise Garibaldi as a sudden
and almost miraculous figure rising about fifty years ago to create
the new Kingdom of Italy and we forget that he must have formed his
first ideas of liberty while hearing at his fathers dinnertable that
Napoleon was the master of Europe Similarly we think of Browning as
the great Victorian poet who lived long enough to have opinions on
Mr Gladstones Home Rule Bill and forget that as a young man he
passed a bookstall and saw a volume ticketed Mr Shelleys Atheistic
Poem and had to search even in his own really cultivated circle for
some one who could tell him who Mr Shelley was Browning was in
short born in the afterglow of the great Revolution
The French Revolution was at root a thoroughly optimistic thing It
may seem strange to attribute optimism to anything so destructive
but in truth this particular kind of optimism is inevitably and by
its nature destructive The great dominant idea of the whole of that
period the period before during and long after the Revolution is
the idea that man would by his nature live in an Eden of dignity
liberty and love and that artificial and decrepit systems are keeping
him out of that Eden No one can do the least justice to the great
Jacobins who does not realise that to them breaking the civilisation
of ages was like breaking the cords of a treasurechest And just as
for more than a century great men had dreamed of this beautiful
emancipation so the dream began in the time of Keats and Shelley to
creep down among the dullest professions and the most prosaic classes
of society A spirit of revolt was growing among the young of the
middle classes which had nothing at all in common with the complete
and pessimistic revolt against all things in heaven or earth which
has been fashionable among the young in more recent times The
Shelleyan enthusiast was altogether on the side of existence he
thought that every cloud and clump of grass shared his strict
republican orthodoxy He represented in short a revolt of the normal
against the abnormal he found himself so to speak in the heart of a
wholly topsyturvy and blasphemous state of things in which God was
rebelling against Satan There began to arise about this time a race
of young men like Keats members of a not highly cultivated middle
class and even of classes lower who felt in a hundred ways this
obscure alliance with eternal things against temporal and practical
ones and who lived on its imaginative delight They were a kind of
furtive universalist they had discovered the whole cosmos and they
kept the whole cosmos a secret They climbed up dark stairs to meagre
garrets and shut themselves in with the gods Numbers of the great
men who afterwards illuminated the Victorian era were at this time
living in mean streets in magnificent daydreams Ruskin was solemnly
visiting his solemn suburban aunts Dickens was going to and fro in a
blacking factory Carlyle slightly older was still lingering on a
poor farm in Dumfriesshire Keats had not long become the assistant of
the country surgeon when Browning was a boy in Camberwell On all
sides there was the first beginning of the sthetic stir in the middle
classes which expressed itself in the combination of so many poetic
lives with so many prosaic livelihoods It was the age of inspired
officeboys
Browning grew up then with the growing fame of Shelley and Keats in
the atmosphere of literary youth fierce and beautiful among new
poets who believed in a new world It is important to remember this
because the real Browning was a quite different person from the grim
moralist and metaphysician who is seen through the spectacles of
Browning Societies and University Extension Lecturers Browning was
first and foremost a poet a man made to enjoy all things visible and
invisible a priest of the higher passions The misunderstanding that
has supposed him to be other than poetical because his form was often
fanciful and abrupt is really different from the misunderstanding
which attaches to most other poets The opponents of Victor Hugo
called him a mere windbag the opponents of Shakespeare called him a
buffoon But the admirers of Hugo and Shakespeare at least knew
better Now the admirers and opponents of Browning alike make him out
to be a pedant rather than a poet The only difference between the
Browningite and the antiBrowningite is that the second says he was
not a poet but a mere philosopher and the first says he was a
philosopher and not a mere poet The admirer disparages poetry in
order to exalt Browning the opponent exalts poetry in order to
disparage Browning and all the time Browning himself exalted poetry
above all earthly things served it with singlehearted intensity and
stands among the few poets who hardly wrote a line of anything else
The whole of the boyhood and youth of Robert Browning has as much the
quality of pure poetry as the boyhood and youth of Shelley We do not
find in it any trace of the analytical Browning who is believed in by
learned ladies and gentlemen How indeed would such sympathisers feel
if informed that the first poems that Browning wrote in a volume
called Incondita were noticed to contain the fault of too much
splendour of language and too little wealth of thought They were
indeed Byronic in the extreme and Browning in his earlier appearances
in society presents himself in quite a romantic manner Macready the
actor wrote of him He looks and speaks more like a young poet than
any one I have ever seen A picturesque tradition remains that Thomas
Carlyle riding out upon one of his solitary gallops necessitated by
his physical sufferings was stopped by one whom he described as a
strangely beautiful youth who poured out to him without preface or
apology his admiration for the great philosophers works Browning at
this time seems to have left upon many people this impression of
physical charm A friend who attended University College with him
says He was then a bright handsome youth with long black hair
falling over his shoulders Every tale that remains of him in
connection with this period asserts and reasserts the completely
romantic spirit by which he was then possessed He was fond for
example of following in the track of gipsy caravans far across
country and a song which he heard with the refrain Following the
Queen of the Gipsies oh rang in his ears long enough to express
itself in his soberer and later days in that splendid poem of the
spirit of escape and Bohemianism The Flight of the Duchess Such
other of these early glimpses of him as remain depict him as striding
across Wimbledon Common with his hair blowing in the wind reciting
aloud passages from Isaiah or climbing up into the elms above Norwood
to look over London by night It was when looking down from that
suburban eyrie over the whole confounding labyrinth of London that he
was filled with that great irresponsible benevolence which is the best
of the joys of youth and conceived the idea of a perfectly
irresponsible benevolence in the first plan of Pippa Passes At the
end of his fathers garden was a laburnum heavy with its weight of
gold and in the tree two nightingales were in the habit of singing
against each other a form of competition which I imagine has since
become less common in Camberwell When Browning as a boy was
intoxicated with the poetry of Shelley and Keats he hypnotised
himself into something approaching to a positive conviction that these
two birds were the spirits of the two great poets who had settled in a
Camberwell garden in order to sing to the only young gentleman who
really adored and understood them This last story is perhaps the most
typical of the tone common to all the rest it would be difficult to
find a story which across the gulf of nearly eighty years awakens so
vividly a sense of the sumptuous folly of an intellectual boyhood
With Browning as with all true poets passion came first and made
intellectual expression the hunger for beauty making literature as
the hunger for bread made a plough The life he lived in those early
days was no life of dull application there was no poet whose youth
was so young When he was full of years and fame and delineating in
great epics the beauty and horror of the romance of southern Europe a
young man thinking to please him said There is no romance now
except in Italy Well said Browning I should make an exception
of Camberwell
Such glimpses will serve to indicate the kind of essential issue that
there was in the nature of things between the generation of Browning
and the generation of his father Browning was bound in the nature of
things to become at the outset Byronic and Byronism was not of
course in reality so much a pessimism about civilised things as an
optimism about savage things This great revolt on behalf of the
elemental which Keats and Shelley represented was bound first of all
to occur Robert Browning junior had to be a part of it and Robert
Browning senior had to go back to his water colours and the faultless
couplets of Pope with the full sense of the greatest pathos that the
world contains the pathos of the man who has produced something that
he cannot understand
The earliest works of Browning bear witness without exception to
this ardent and somewhat sentimental evolution Pauline appeared
anonymously in 1833 It exhibits the characteristic mark of a juvenile
poem the general suggestion that the author is a thousand years old
Browning calls it a fragment of a confession and Mr Johnson Fox an
old friend of Brownings father who reviewed it for Taits
Magazine said with truth that it would be difficult to find
anything more purely confessional It is the typical confession of a
boy laying bare all the spiritual crimes of infidelity and moral
waste in a state of genuine ignorance of the fact that every one else
has committed them It is wholesome and natural for youth to go about
confessing that the grass is green and whispering to a priest
hoarsely that it has found a sun in heaven But the records of that
particular period of development even when they are as ornate and
beautiful as Pauline are not necessarily or invariably wholesome
reading The chief interest of Pauline with all its beauties lies
in a certain almost humorous singularity the fact that Browning of
all people should have signalised his entrance into the world of
letters with a poem which may fairly be called morbid But this is a
morbidity so general and recurrent that it may be called in a
contradictory phrase a healthy morbidity it is a kind of intellectual
measles No one of any degree of maturity in reading Pauline will be
quite so horrified at the sins of the young gentleman who tells the
story as he seems to be himself It is the utterance of that bitter
and heartrending period of youth which comes before we realise the one
grand and logical basis of all optimismthe doctrine of original sin
The boy at this stage being an ignorant and inhuman idealist regards
all his faults as frightful secret malformations and it is only later
that he becomes conscious of that large and beautiful and benignant
explanation that the heart of man is deceitful above all things and
desperately wicked That Browning whose judgment on his own work was
one of the best in the world took this view of Pauline in after
years is quite obvious He displayed a very manly and unique capacity
of really laughing at his own work without being in the least ashamed
of it This he said of Pauline is the only crab apple that
