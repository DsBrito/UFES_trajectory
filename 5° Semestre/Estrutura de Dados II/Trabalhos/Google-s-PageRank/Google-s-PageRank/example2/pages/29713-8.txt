Who would set forth to explore the realm of our Ballad Literature needs
not to hamper himself with biographical baggage Whatever misgivings and
misadventures may beset him in his wayfaring there is no risk of
breaking neck or limb over dates or names For of dates and names and
other solid landmarks there are none to guide us in this misty
morningland of poetry The balladist is a voice and nothing morea
voice singing in a chorus of others in which only faintly and
uncertainly we sometimes fancy we can make out the note but rarely
anything of the person or history of the individual singer In the
hierarchy of song he is a priest after the order of Melchisedecwithout
father or mother beginning of days or end of life
The Scottish ballads we may thus love and know by heart and concerning
their preservation collection collation we may gather a large store
of facts But the original balladwriters themselves must remain for us
the Great Unknown Here and there one can lay down vague lines that seem
to confine a particular ballad or group of ballads within particular
bounds of place and of time Here and there one seems to get a glimpse
of the balladist himself as onlooker or as actor in the scenes of
fateful love and deathless grief which he has fixed for ever in the
memory of men of his race and blood There are passages in which in the
light and heat of battle or in agony of terror or sorrow we are made
to see something of the minstrel as well as his theme But by no
research are we likely at this late date to recover any clew to the
birthplace or to the lineaments of the life and face of the grand old
poet who wrote the grand old ballad of Sir Patrick Spens nor do towns
contend for the honour of having produced the sweet singer of
Kirkconnel Lea the blithe minstrel of Glenlogie or the first of
all the bards who made the Dowie Dens of Yarrow vocal with the song of
unavailing sorrow
And in truth townseven such towns as were in those dayscould have
had but little to do with the birth and shaping of the Scottish
Balladists Chief among the marks by which we may the true balladmaker
know among the versemakers of his age is the openair feeling that
pervades his thought and style Like the Black Douglas he likes better
to hear the laverock sing than the mouse cheep It is not only that he
cares to tread the bent sae brown rather than the paved street that
the tragedies of fiery love and hate quenched by death in which he
delights are more often enacted under the blue cope of heaven than
under vault of stone What we seem to feel is that these simple old
lays in which lives a passion that still catches the breath and makes
the cheek turn palewhose words of might have yet the power to waft
us mind and sense into the Land of Faery must have been conceived
and brought to full strength under the light of the sun and the breath
of the wind The Muse says Robert Burns himself of the true kin of
the balladists
The Muse nae Poet ever fand her
Till by himsel he learned to wander
Adown some trottin burns meander
An no think lang
Certainly no true ballad was ever hammered out at the desk It may have
been wrought and fashioned for singing in bower or hall but the fire
that shaped it was caught in gloaming grey or under the lee licht o
the mune in birken shaw or by wan water
It is true that one of the earliest of the Scots balladmakers whose
names have been handed down to usRobert Henryson who taught the
Dunfermline bairns in the hornbook in the fifteenth centuryhas told us
that he sought inspiration at the ingleside over a glass
I mend the fyre and beikit me about
Then tuik ane drink my spreitis to confort
And armit me weill fra the cold thairout
To cut the winter nicht and mak it schort
I tuik ane quhair and left all uther sport
But this was while conning in cold weather the classic tale of
Troilus and Cressid Robin and Makyne which among Henrysons
acknowledged pieces except The Bluidy Sark comes nearest to our
conception of the balladafter all it is but a pastoralhas the scent
of the grene wode in summer
In sooth the Ballad Poet was neither made nor born he grew The wild
flowers of literature is the name that has been bestowed with some
little air of condescension upon the rich inheritance he has left us
They are the purest and the strongest growth of the genius of the race
and of the soil and though they owe little save injury and mutilation
to those who have deliberately sought to prune and trim them to please a
later taste they are as full of vigour and sap today as they were in
the Ballad Age when such poetry sprung up naturally and spontaneously
It is probable that not one of the old ballads that have come down to us
by oral recitation is the product of a single hand or of twenty hands
The greater its age and the greater its popular favour the greater is
the number of individual memories and imaginations through which it has
been filtered taking from each some trace of colour some flavour of
style or character some improving or modifying touch The personal
equation is in the ballad a quantity at once immense and unknown As
in Homers Iliad the voice we hear is not that of any individual
poet but of an age and of a peoplea voice simple almost monotonous
in its rhythmic rise and fall but charged with meanings multitudinous
and unutterable
The Scottish ballads are undoubtedly in their present form the outcome
of a long and strenuous process of selection In its earlier stages the
ballad was not written down but passed from mouth to mouth Additions
interpolations changes infinite must have been made in the course of
transmission and repetition Like a hardy plant it had the power to
spread and send down fresh roots wherever it found favourable soil and
in its new ground it always as we shall see took some colour and
character from the locality the time and the race Golden lines and
verses may have been shed in the passage from place to place and down
the centuries But less of this happened we may feel sure than a
purging away of the dross As a rule what was fittestwhat was truest
to nature and to human naturesurvived and was perpetuated in this
evolution of the ballad When in the course of its progress it
gathered to itself anything that was precious and worthy of remembrance
then by the very law of things this was seized and stored in the
memories of the listeners and handed down to future generations
But this process of purging and refining the ballad so that it shall
becomelike the language the proverbs the folklore and nursery tales
and the traditional music of a nationthe reflection of the history and
character of the race itself if it is to be genuine must go on
unconsciously As soon as the ballad is written downat least as soon
as it is fixed in printthe elements of natural growth it possesses are
arrested It is removed from its natural environment and means of
healthy subsistence and development and from a hardy outdoor plant it
is in danger of becoming a plant of the closeta potted thing watered
with printers ink and trimmed with the editorial shears Ballads have
sprung up and blossomed in a literary age but as soon as the spirit
that is called literary seizes upon them and seeks to mould them to its
forms they begin to droop and to lose their native bloom and wildwood
fragrance It is because they neglect or are ignorant of literary
models and conventions and go back to the eternal verities of human
passion and human motive and actionbecause they speak to the great
heart of manthat they are what they are
Few of our ballads have escaped those sophisticated touches of art
which happily are easily detected in the rough homespun of the old
lays Walter Scott the last of the minstrels to whom ballad literature
owes more than to any who went before or who has come after him was
himself not above mending the strains gathered from the lips of old
women hill shepherds and the wandering tribe of cadgers and hawkers
so that one is sometimes a little at a loss to tell what is original and
what is imitation But even the Wizards hand is not cunning enough to
patch the new so deftly upon the old that the difference cannot be
detected The genuine ballad touch is incommunicable to improve upon it
is like painting the lilies of the field
In the ranks of the Balladists then we do not include the many writers
of meritsome of them of geniuswho have worked in the lines of the
elder race of singers copying their measures and seeking to enter into
their spirit The studied simplicity the deliberate archaisms the
overstrained vigour or pathos of these modern ballads do but convince us
that the vein is wellnigh worked out The writers could not help
thinking of their models and materials the old minstrels sang with no
thought but telling what they saw with their eyes and heard with their
ears But even in these days the precious lode of ballad poetry will
sometimes break to the surface a phrase or a whole verse fashioned in
the Iron Age will recall the Age of Gold Scott has many such and to
take a more modern instance the spirit of Sir Patrick Spens seems to
inspire almost throughout George MacDonalds Yerl o Watery Deck now
with a graphic stroke of description anon with a sudden gleam of
humour as when the Skipper in haste to escape his pursuers hacked
with his sword at the stout rope that bound his craft to the pier
And thocht it oure weel made
and again when the Kings Daughter chose between father and lover in
words that leap forth like a sword from its scabbard
I loot me low to my father for grace
Down on my bended knee
But I rise and I look my king in the face
For the Skipper s the king o me
But even here where we touch highwater mark of the latterday Scottish
ballad one seems to find a faint reminiscence of stagesetting and
effect of purposed antithesis of ethical discriminations unfamiliar to
the manner and mode of thought of the ancient balladist The latter it
may be said does not stop to think or to analyse or moralise he feels
and is content to tell us in the most direct and naive language all
that he has felt He has not learned the new trick of introspection he
is guided by intuition and the primval instincts He carries from his
own lips to ours a draught of pure strong human passion stirred into
action by provocations of love jealousy revenge and grief such as
visit but rarely our orderly workaday modern world He renders for us
the form and express feature of his time and though the
draughtsmanship may be rude it is free from suspicion of either
flattery or bias It is not enlisted in the cause of any moral theory or
literary ideal It is so far as it goes truth naked and not ashamed
But the nativegrown ballad takes also colour from the ground whence it
springs It has the tang of the soil as well as the savour of the blood
Fletcher of Saltouns hackneyed epigram Let me make a countrys
ballads and let who will make its laws does not embody all the truth
A country and the race inhabiting it may not be responsible for the laws
that govern it But a country and a people may rightly be tried and
judged by their balladstheir own handiwork their own offspring The
more cultured and highlydeveloped products of a national literature
however healthy however strong and beautiful must always owe much to
neighbouring and to universal influences Like the language and manners
of the educated classes of a nation they conform more or less to models
of worldwide and agelong acceptance among educated men But in the
ballad one goes to the root of national character to the pith and
marrow of national life and history
What then thus questioned do the Scottish ballads teach us of Scotland
and the Scots Surely much to be proud of They are among the most
precious as they are among the oldest of our possessions as a people
Nay it may be held that they are the best and choicest of all the
contributions that Scotland has made to poetry and story They are
written in her hearts blood Even the songs of Burns and the tales of
Scott must take second rank after the ballads their purest inspiration
was drawn from those rude old lays In this field of national
literature at least we need not fear comparison with any other land
and people Our ballads are distinctly different and in the opinion of
unbiassed literary judges also distinctly superior to the rich and
beautiful balladlore of the Southern Kingdom One can even note an
expressive diversity of style and spirit in the ballads originating on
the North and on the South margin of the Border line The latter do not
yield in rough vigour and blunt manliness to the ballads grown on the
northern slope of Cheviot Chevy Chase may challenge comparison with
The Battle of Otterburn and come at least as well out of the contest
as the Percy did from his meeting with the Douglas and in many other
ballads which the two nations have in commonThe Heir of Linn for
examplethe English may fairly be held to bear away the bell from the
Scottish version We do not possess a group of ballads pervaded so
thoroughly with the freedom and delight of living under the leaves
greene as those of the Robin Hood Cycle although we also have our
songs of the gay greenwood although bows twanged as keenly in Ettrick
Forest and in Braidislee Wood as in Sherwood itself and we can even
claim partly perhaps as a relic of the days when the King of Scotland
was Prince of Cumbria and Earl of Huntingdon the bold Robin and his
merry men among the heroes of our ballad literature
But on the whole mirth and lightheartedness are very far from being
characteristics of the Scottish ballads Of ballad themes in general it
has been said that they concern themselves mainly with the tragedy and
the pathos of the life of feudal and early times while on the other
hand the folksong reflects the sunnier hours of the days of old This
is peculiarly true of the Scottish ballads The best of them are dipped
in gloom of the grave They breathe the very soul of the old unhappy
faroff times Even over the true lovers Fate stands from the first
with a drawn sword and the story ends with the jow of the deid bell
rather than with the wedding chimes Superstitious terrors too add a
shadow of their own to these tragedies of crossed and lawless love and
swiftfollowing vengeance In this respect the Scottish ballads are
more nearly akin to the popular poetry of Denmark and other countries
across the North Sea than to that of our neighbours across the Tweed
There are a score of ballads that agree so closely in plot and
structure and even in names and phrases with Norse or German versions
that it is impossible to doubt that they have been drawn directly from
the same source Either they have been transplanted thither in the many
descents which the Northmen made on Scotland as is witnessed not only
by the chronicles but by existing words and customs and placenames
scattered thickly around our coasts or what may perhaps be as strongly
argued both versions may have come from an older and common original
Celtic influences are also present although scarcely perhaps so
directly manifest as might have been expected considering that the
Celtic race and speech must at one time have been spread almost
universally over Scotland they appear rather in the spirit than in the
plot and scene and characters of the typical Scottish ballad They
supply unquestionably a large portion of that feeling of mystery of
overshadowing fate and melancholy yearningthat air of another world
surrounding and infecting the life of the senseswhich seems to
distinguish the body and soul of Scottish ballad poetry from the more
matteroffact budget of the English minstrels
But it has to be remembered that the matrix of the ballads that have
taken first place in the love and in the memory of Scotland was the
region most remote and isolated from the Highlands and the Highlanders
during the balladmaking era This is the basin of the Tweedthe howms
of Yarrow Leader haughs and Ettrick shaws the clear streams that flow
past ruined abbey and peeltower through green folds of the Cheviots
and the Lammermuirs that for hundreds of years were the chosen homes of
Border war and romance Next after these come the banks of Clyde and
Forth Annan Water and the streams of Ayr and Galloway and ballads and
ballad localities differing somewhat in theme and structure in mood
and metre from those of the South as Aberdonian differs from Borderer
and the Men of the Mearns from the Men of the Merse are found scattered
thinly or sprinkled thickly over the whole North by Tay and Dee and
Spey
These latter streams are partly without and partly within the Highland
Line across which as unacquainted with a language that has its own
rich and peculiar store of legend and ballad poetry we do not propose
to penetrate sufficient field for exploration is provided by the Scots
ballads in Scots But when these were in the making the Highland Line
must have run down much lower into the Lowlands than it does today the
retreating Gaelic had still outposts in Buchan and even in Fife and
Ayr and Galloway In the ballads of the Northeastern Counties the
feuds of Highland chiefs and the raids of Highland caterans make
themselves seen and felt too visibly and not too sympathetically in
the ditties of their Lowland neighbours The Hielandmen play the part
that the English clans from Bewcastle and Redesdale play in the Border
ballads The Red Harlaw in those boreal provinces was a landmark and
turningpoint in history and poetry as Bannockburn or Flodden was in
the South By Hangingshaws or Hermitage Castle they knew little of the
Highlander being too much absorbed in their own quarrels on Donside
and in the Lennox they knew him better than they liked him and it was
not until a comparatively recent period of literary history that the
kilted warrior began to take his place as a heroic and imposing figure
in the poetry and prose of the Scottish vernacular
Making all allowance for borrowings and influences drawn from without
may we not still say that the Scottish ballad owes nearly all that is
best in itthe sweetness not less than the strength of this draught of
old poetry and passionto the land and to the folk that gave it birth
A land thrust further into the gloom and cold of stormy seas than the
Southern Kingdom a land whose spare gifts are but the more esteemed by
its children because they are given so grudgingly whose high and bleak
and stern features make the valleys they shelter the more lovely and
loved from the contrast a race whose blood has been blended of many
strains and tempered by long centuries of struggle with nature and with
outside enemies perfervid of spirit and dour of will holding with
strong grip to the things of this world but never losing consciousness
of the nearness and mystery of the world of things invisible with a
borderline on either side of them that for hundreds of years had to be
kept with the strong hand and the stout heart and behind them a
background of history more charged with trouble and romance than that of
almost any other nation in Europewhere should the ballad draw pith and
sap and colour if not on such a soil and among such a people If Mr
Buckle was able to trace the complexion and form of Scottish religion in
the climate and configuration of Scotland much more easily should we be
able to find the atmosphere and scenery of Scotland reflected in her
ballads
CHAPTER II
BALLAD GROWTH AND BALLAD HISTORY
ClownWhat hast here ballads
MopsaPray now buy some I love a ballad in print a life
for then we are sure they are trueWinters Tale
There is probably not a verse there is scarcely a line in the existing
body of Scottish ballad poetry that can be traced with certainty further
back than the sixteenth century Many of them chronicle events that took
place in the seventeenth century and there are a few that deal with
even later history It may seem a bold thing therefore to claim for
these traditional tales in verse the much more venerable antiquity
implied in what has been said in the previous chapter If we were to be
guided by the accessible literary and historical data or even by the
language of the ballads themselves we should be disposed to believe
that the productive period of balladmaking was confined within two or
at most three hundred years
It would be more than rash however to imagine that ballads did not
live and grow and spread in the obscure but fertile ground of the
popular fancy and the popular memory because they did not crop up in
the contemporary printed literature and were overlooked by the
dryasdust chroniclers of the time Nor is it a paradox to say that a
ballad may be older by ages than the hero and the deeds that it seems
to celebrate Like thistledown it has the property of floating from
place to place and even from kingdom to kingdom and from epoch to
epoch changing names and circumstances to suit the locality and
attaching itself to outstanding figures and fresh events without
changing its essential spirit and character The more formal Muses
despised these rude and unlettered rhymeswhen they noticed them at all
it was in a disdainful or patronising spiritand this holds true of the
eighteenth century almost as much as of the sixteenth It is not that
ballad poetry was dumb but that history was deaf and blind to its
beauties
Nor is any adverse judgment as to the antiquity of the Scottish ballad
to be drawn from the comparative modernity of the style and language
The presence of archaisms in a ballad that claims to have been handed
down by oral repetition from a remote period is on the contrary a
thing to raise suspicion as to its genuineness The ballad as has been
said is a living and growing organism or at least it is this until it
has been committed to print However deep into the mould of the past its
roots run down its language and idioms should not be much older than
the popular speech of the time when it has been gathered into the
collectors budget It is like a plant that while remaining the same
at the heart and root is constantly casting the old and putting out
fresh leaves
Thus the very words and phrases that were intended to give an antique
air to Hardyknut stamped it as an imitation these clumsy and
artificial patches were not the true mosses of age The ballad of true
lineage partly from its simplicity of thought and structure partly
from being kept in immediate contact with the lips and the hearts of the
people is as readily understanded of the general today as when it
was first sung
It has been noted for instance that our ballads preserve fewer
reminiscences of the time when alliteration shared importance with rhyme
or took its place in the metrical system The bulk of them are supposed
to come hither from the early sixteenth century from the reigns of
James IV and James V and in that period of Scottish literature
alliteration not only blossomed but often overran and smothered the
court poetry of the day Alliterative lines and verses appear frequently
in the ballads but always with good taste often with exquisite effect
What phrases are more familiar more infused with the magic of the
balladspirit than the wan water the bent sae brown the lee
licht o the mune When the knight rides forth to see his true love he
mounts on his berry brown steed and fares oer dale and down until
he comes to the castle wa where the lady sits sewing her silken
seam He kisses her cheek and chin and she kilts her green kirtle
and follows him but not so fast as to outrun fate In the oldest set
of The Battle of Otterburn alliteration asserts itself
The rae full reckless there sche runnes
To make the game and glee
It is but seldom that the balladist avails himself so freely of the
artful aid of this device as in Johnie o Braidislee the vigorous
hunting lay that was a favourite with Carlyles mother
Won up won up my good grey dogs
Won up and be unboun
For we maun awa to Brides braid wood
To ding the dun deer doun doun
To ding the dun deer doun
The words that have had the best chance of coming down to us intact on
the stream of balladverse or with only such marks of attrition and
wear as might be caused by time and a rough channel are those to which
the popular mind of a later day has been unable to attach any definite
meaning for instance certain names of places and houses titles and
functions snatches of refrains phrases reminiscent of otherwise
forgotten primval or medival customs and the like These remain bedded
like fossils in the more recent deposits and form a curious study for
those who have time to enter into it in the archology and palontology
of the ballad Childe Rowland Hynde Horn Kempion furnish us
with words drawn from the language of Gothic and Norman chivalry that
must have dropped out of the common speech long before the ballads began
to be regularly collected and printed They recall the gentleness and
courtesy as well as the courage that were supposed to be attributes of
the most perfect goodly knightattributes in which sooth to say the
typical knight of the Scottish ballad is not always a pattern
KempionKaempe or Champion Owayneis supposed to perpetuate the
name of OwainapUrien King of Reged celebrated by Taliessin and the
other early Welsh bards And this is by no means the only instance in
which ballads appear to have distilled the spirit and blended names and
stories out of both Celtic and Teutonic legend Thus Glasgerion which
in the bestknown Scottish version has become Glenkindie has been
translated as GlaskeraintGeraint the Blue Bardan Orpheus among
the Brythons whose chief legendary sites according to Mr Skene
Professor Rhys and other authorities are to be sought in Scotland and
its borderlands The fame of this harper who like Glenkindie could
wile the fish from the flood came down to the times of Chaucer and
Gavin Douglas and was by them passed on the former mentions him in his
House of Fame along with Chiron and Orion
And other Harpers many one
With the Briton Glasgerion
It is not too much to conjecture that it was remembered also in popular
poetry and these and other classical writers of the Middle Ages who
despised not the common folk and their ways no doubt drank deeply of
knowledge and inspiration from the clear and hidden well of English
poetry and romance even then existing in ballad lore In fact it seems
as probable that the prose and metrical romances of chivalry have been
derived from the folksongs they resemble as that the ballads have been
borrowed from the romances perhaps both owe their descent to a common
and forgotten ancestor
Is it too much to believe that in our older ballads we hear the echoes
of the voicesit may be the very wordsof the old bards the harpers
and the minstrels who sang in the ears of princes and people as far
back as history can carry us We know by experience of other lands and
races from Samoa to Sicily that are still in their earlier or later
balladage that the making of ballads is almost as old as the making of
war or of lovethat it long precedes letters to say nothing of the
printed page It comes as natural for men to sing of the pangs of
passion or of the joys of victory as to kiss or to fight For untold
generations the harps twanged in the hall and the song of battle and
the song of sorrow found eager listeners All the while the same tales
though perhaps in ruder and simpler guise met with as warm a welcome in
road and field and at country merrymaking Trouvere and wandering
minstrel gleeman and eke gleemaiden passed from place to place and
from land to land repeating altering adapting the old stock of heroic
or lovelorn ditties or inventing new ones They were a law unto
themselves in other matters than metres and had their own guilds their
own courts and their own kings The names of all but a few that
chance more than anything else has preserved have perished But time
may have been more tender than we know to their thoughts and words or
to their words and music where these have been fitly wedded together
It may have saved for us some thrilling image as old as the time of the
scalds some scrap of melody which Ossian or Llywarch Hen but improved
and handed on The law of the conservation of force holds good in the
world of poetry as well as in the physical world and all that is
dispersed and forgotten in ancient song is not lost It is fused into
the general stock of the nations ideas and memories and the richest
and purest relics of it are perhaps to be sought in the Scottish
ballads
The chroniclers who set down often at inordinate and wearisome length
what was said and done in court or council or monastery did not wholly
overlook the gospel of green fields sung by the contemporary
minstrels But their notices are provokingly vague and unsatisfactory
no happy thought ever seems to have occurred to any monkish penman that
he might earn more gratitude from posterity by collecting ballad verses
than by copying the Legends of the Saintsso little can we guess what
will be deemed of value by future ages But in Scotland as elsewhere
we have reason to believe that every event that deeply moved the popular
mind gave rise to its crop of ballads either freshly invented or worked
up out of the old ballad stock So sharply were incidents connected with
the departure of a Scottish Princess daughter of King Alexander III
to be the bride of Eric of Norway imprinted on peoples minds that
according to Motherwells calculation the ballad of Sir Patrick Spens
preserves the very days of the week when the expedition set sail and
made the land
They hoisted their sails on a Mononday morn
Wi a the speed they may
And they have landed in Norawa
Upon a Wodensday
But this has the fault of proving too much The last virtue that the
ballad can claim is that of accuracy With every desire to find proof
and confirmation in the very calendar of the antiquity of this glorious
old rhyme one is disposed to suspect these dates to be a lucky hit in
fact no sounder evidence than the correct enumeration of the daughters
of George fourth Earl of Huntly in the old Aberdeenshire ballad
The Lord o Gordon had three daughters
Elizabeth Margaret and Jean
