there has been a difference of opinions among other authors Some
parts have been quoted entirely but due credit has been given it is
believed wherever such is the case
It is not claimed that this little work covers the whole ground but
it is intended to describe and explain thoroughly three or four of
the more prominent styles of Truss leaving the other forms of Wooden
Bridges to a subsequent volume
Abutments and Piers as well as Box and Arch Culverts belonging more
properly to masonry will be treated of hereafter under that head
Iron Bridges form a distinct class and may be mentioned separately at
some future period
If this small volume should lead the student of Engineering to examine
carefully the best Bridges of modern practice and study the larger
scientific works on this art the author will feel satisfied that his
efforts have not been entirely in vain

Modern American Bridge Building
BRIDGE BUILDING
The simplest bridge that can be built is a single beam or stick of
timber spanning the opening between the abutmentsbut this is only
of very limited applicationonly for spans of 20 feet and less
owing to the rapid increase in sectional dimensions which is required
as the span becomes greater
Next comes the single beam supported by an inclined piece from each
abutment meeting each other at the middle point of the under side of
the beamor another arrangement of two braces footing securely on
the beam and meeting at a point above the middle point of the beam
which is suspended from the apex of the triangle formed by them by
means of an iron rodThese arrangements may be used up to 50 feet
For any span beyond 50 feet modifications of this arrangement are
used which will be described hereafter Now let us investigate shortly
the different strains that the various parts of a bridge have to
bearand the strength of the materials used The theory of strains in
bridge trusses is merely that of the Composition and Resolution of
Forces The various strains to which the materials of a bridge are
subjectedare compression extension and detrusion
Wood and Iron are the materials more generally employed in bridge
constructionand in this pamphlet we shall take the following as the
working strength of the materialsper square inch of section
Tension  Compression  Detrusion
Wood          2000       1000          150
Wrot Iron   15000      11000
Cast Iron     4500      25000
Tension If a weight of 2000 lbs were hung to the lowest end of a
vertical beam so that the line of action of the weight and axis of
the beam formed one and the same straight linethe tension on the
beam would be 2000 lbs But if the beam were inclined and the force
acted in a vertical direction then the strain would be increased in
the ratio of the increase of the diagonal of inclination over the
verticalsuppose the beam is 20 ft long and inclined at an angle of
45and let 2000 lbs as before be suspended from its lower end
Now the diagonal being 20the vertical will be 14014 ftand the
strain will be found as follows
14014  20  2000  2854lbs
The greater the angle of inclination from the horizontal the less the
strain from a given loadand when the beam is vertical the weight
causes the least strain
Compression If we load a vertical post with a weight of 2000 lbs
the strain of compression exerted upon the post will be 2000 lbs Now
if we incline the postthe strain will be increased as we have shown
above under the head of tension and in like manner dependent upon
the inclination
But when wood iron or any other material is used for a pillar or
strut it has not only to resist a crushing force but also a force
tending to bend or bulge it laterally
A post of circular section with a length of 7 or 8 diameters will not
bulge with any force applied longitudinally but will split But if
the length exceeds this limitit will be destroyed by an action
similar to that of a transverse strain
A cast iron column of thirty diameters in length is fractured by
bending when the length is less than this ratioby bending and
splitting off of wedge shaped pieces But by casting the column
hollow and swelling it in the middle its strength is greatly
increased
Barlows formula for finding the weight that can be sustained by any
beam acting as a pillar or strut before bending is

the crosssectionwe shall have

TeX d  sqrt3fracWL280 EB and b  fracWL280 ED3
in the above formul
W  weight in pounds
L  length in feet
E  a constant
b  breadth in inches
d  depth in inches
Transverse Strains The strain caused by any weight applied
transversely to a beam supported at both ends is directly as the
breadth and square of the depth and inversely as the length It
causes the beam to be depressed towards the middle of its length
forming a curve concave to the horizontal and below it In assuming
this formthe fibres of the upper part of the beam are compressed
and those of the lower part are extendedconsequently there must be
some line situated between the upper and lower surfaces of the beam
where the fibers are subjected to neither of these two forces this
line is called the neutral axis
These two strains of compression and extension must be equal in
amountand upon the relative strength of the material to resist these
strains as well as its form and position the situation of this axis
depends If wood resists a compression of 1000 lbs per square inch of
section and a tension of 2000 lbs the axis will be twice as far from
the top as from the bottom in a rectangular beam
The following table by Mr GL Vose gives with sufficient accuracy
for practice the relative resisting powers of wood wrought and cast
iron with the corresponding positions of the axis
Dist of axis
Resistance  Resistance            from top in
to          to                fracs of

Wrought Iron    90          66        9066   90156 or 058
Cast Iron       20         111       20111   20131 or 015
Wood             2           1          21    23 or 066
Thus we see that the resistance of a beam to a cross strain as well
as to tension and compression is affected by the incompressibility
and inextensibility of the material
The formula for the dimensions of any beam to support a strain
transversely is
4 bd2

TeX S  frac4 bd2l
S  the ultimate strength in lbs
b  the breadth in inches
d  the depth in inches
l  the length in inches
Detrusion Detrusion is the crushing against some fixed point such
as obtains where a brace abuts against a chord or where a bridge
rests on a bolster and the shearing of pins bolts and rivets also
comes under this head
General Abstract The resistance to the above mentioned strains
varies as the area of the cross section so that by doubling the area
we double the strength Any material will bear a much greater strain
for a short time than for a long one The working strength of materials
or the weight which does not injure them enough to render them unsafe
is a mooted point and varies according to the authority from 13
to 110 of the ultimate strength The ratio of the ultimate strength
to the working strength is called the factor of safety
The following is a table of ultimate and working strengths of
materials and factors of safety

Lateral Adhesion Lateral adhesion is the resistance offered by the
fibres to sliding past each other in the direction of the grain as
when a brace is notched into a chord or tie beam at its foot it is
prevented by the lateral adhesion of the fibres from crowding off the
piece to the depth of the notch against which it toes Barlows
experiments give the lateral adhesion of fir as 600 lbs per square
inch and the factor of safety employed varies in practice from 4 to
6 giving a working strength of from 150 to 100 lbs per square inch

In tensional strains the length of the beam does not affect the
strength but in the beams submitted to compression the length is a
most important element and in the table given above the safety
strains to which beams may be subjected without crushing or bending
has been given for lengths varying from 6 to 60 diameters
PRACTICAL RULES

Then we have T  Sa
Now to find the necessary sectional area for resisting any strain we

TeX a  fracTS
or by substituting the working strengths for the various materials in
the formula we have for wood
a  T2000
Wrought Iron   a  T1500
Cast Iron      a  T4500
But in practice cast iron is seldom used except to resist
compression
Strains of Compression Allowing the same letters to denote the
same things as above we have for
Wood a  T1000
Wrought Iron a  T12000
Cast Iron a  T25000
As this pamphlet has to do with wooden bridges only nothing will be
said of the proper relative dimensions of castiron columns to sustain
the strains to which they may be subjected but a table of the
strength of columns will be found further on
Transverse Strains
Let W  breaking weight in lbs

Then for the power of a beam to resist a transverse strain we shall
have

This formula has been derived from experiments made by the most
reliable authorities
The constant 1250 adopted for wood in the following formula is an
average constant derived from the table of those woods more commonly
used
Now to reduce the formula to the most convenient shape for use we
substitute the value of s and we have
4 x 1250 bd2

TeX W  frac4 times 1250 bd2L
or
5000 bd2

But to reduce the load to the proper working strain we must divide
this equivalent by 4 the factor of safety and we shall have

TeX W  frac5000 bd24 L
Let us apply the formula

For a cast iron beam or girderMr Hodgkinson found from numerous
carefully conducted experiments that by arranging the material in the
form of an inverted Tthus creating a small top flange as well as the
larger bottom one the resistance was increased per unit of section
over that of a rectangular beam in the ratio of 40 to 23
In this beam the areas of the top and bottom flanges are inversely
proportional to the power of the iron to resist compression and
extension Mr Hodgkinsons formula for the dimensions of his girder
is

In the above formula for cast iron beams
W  weight in tons

The web uniting the two flanges must be made solidas any opening by

These dimensions will give ample strength and stiffness Fig 1 Plate
I gives an illustration of this kind of bridgein which a a are
the bolsters or wall plates shown in section to which the bridge
beams are notched and bolted Fig 1 A Plate I shows the method of
diagonally bracing these beams by planks dimensions of which in
general use are 6 to 8 by 2 to 3 inches The track should rest on
ties about 6 inches by 8 or 10 inchesthe same bolt confining the
ends of the ties and diagonal braces when practicable These ties
should be notched on the string pieces 2 or 3 incheswithout cutting
the stringers Below is a table giving general dimensions in inches
of the several parts of a bridge of this description

Each bolt must have a washer under the head and also under the nut
For a span of from 15 to 30 feet we can use the combination shown in
Plate II Fig 3 The piece A F must have the same dimensions as a
simple string piece of a length A Bso that it may not yield between
B and either of the points A or D The two braces D F and E F must be
stiff enough to support the load coming upon them Suppose the weight
on a pair of drivers of a Locomotive to be 10 tons then each side
must bear 5 tons and each brace 212 tons  212 x 2240  5600 lbs
Now to allow for sudden or extra strains call 8000 lbs the strain
to be supported by each brace and accordingly 8 square inches of
sectional area would be sufficient for compression only but as the
brace is inclined the strain is increased Let the vertical distance
from A to D be 10 ft and calling the span 30 ftA B will be 15
ftfrom whence D F must be 18 ft then we shall have the proportion
10  18  8000  14400 lbs
which would require an area of about 15 square inches of section to
resist compression or a piece 3x5 inches Now as this stick is more
than 6 or 8 diameters in length it will yield by bendingand
consequently its area must be increased The load which a piece of
wood acting as a post or strut will safely sustain is found by the
formula already given

which is something larger than is actually required but it is no
harm to have an excess of strength Now in many cases this arrangement
would be objectionable as not affording sufficient head room on
account of the bracesand we can as well use the form of structure
given in Pl I Fig 3 since it is evidently immaterial whether the
point B be supported on F or suspended from it provided we can
prevent motion in the feet of the braces which is done by notching
them into the stringer at that point This of course creates a
tensional strain along the stringer which is found as
followsRepresenting the applied weight by F B Pl II Fig 2 draw

This style of structure may be used up to 50 feet but it is not
employed for spans exceeding 30 feet in length It is very customary
to make the braces in pairs so as to use smaller scantling and gain
in lateral stiffnessthe two pieces forming one brace by being
properly blocked and bolted together Below is given a table of
dimensions for the various parts of this style of structure

Single Beams under each rail firmly braced laterally and trussed by
an iron rod or preferably by two iron rods and a post on the under
side of the beam The deflection of the rod is usually taken at 18 of
the span Pl II Fig 1 represents this style of trussing a
beamwhich is generally used for spans of from 15 to 30 ft Below is
a table of dimensions for this truss with single and double rods if
double rods are used only half the given section will be necessary for
each one of the pair

It is as well to tenon the post into the beam and also strap it
firmly with iron platesand the end should be shod with iron to form
a saddle for the rods to bear upon
Now if we should make a bridge on the plan of Fig 3 Pl I 75 or
100 feet or perhaps more in length the braces A F and F C would
not only be very long but very large and heavy and one chief
requisite in a good bridge is to have all the beams so proportioned
that they will resist all the strains acting upon them without being
unnecessarily large It now becomes necessary to have a different
arrangement of the parts of the truss in order to obtain increased
length of span
Suppose we have a span of 40 feet as represented in Fig 2 Pl I
Now instead of running the braces from A C until they meet in a point
as before we stop them at a and c and place the straining beam a c
between them to prevent those points from approaching suspend the
points B and D from them and start the braces B b and D band if
the truss were longer would continue on in the same manner as far as
needful To prevent the truss from altering its form as shown by the
dotted lines A b C and A E C by any passing load we insert the
counter braces marked R
The braces A a and C c must support all of the weight of the bridge
and its load within the parallelogram B a c Dand the next set of
braces B b and D b sustain that part of the load which comes over
the centre of the bridge Consequently the braces must increase in
size from the centre towards the abutments The rods resist the same
pressure in amount as their bracesbut being vertical do not need
the increase given to the braces on account of their inclinationbut
increase simply with the strain upon them from the centre to the ends
of the truss
There are many forms of small bridges differing from those enumerated
in various minor details but sufficient has been said to give the
