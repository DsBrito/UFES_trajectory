THE NORWEGIAN
I believe the old Italian proverb says that every man before he dies
should do three things Get a son build a house and write a book
Now whether or not I am desirous by beginning at the end to end at
the beginning of this quaint axiom I leave the reader to conjecture My
book may afford amusement to him who will smile when I am glad and
sympathise with the impressions I have caught in other moods of mind
but I have little affinity of feeling and less companionship with him
who expects to see pictures of life coloured differently from those I
have beheld
At three oclock on the boisterous afternoon of the 1st of May 1847 I
left Greenwich with my friend Lord R in his yacht to cruise round
the coasts of Denmark Norway and Sweden and although the period of
the year at which I quitted London was the one I most desired to remain
in it and join as far as I was able in the pomps and gaieties of Old
Babylon I did not like to miss this opportunity offered under such
favourable circumstances of seeing countries so rarely visited by
Englishmen more particularly as the invitation had been pressed upon me
so unaffectedly and kindly that I could not with any reason decline
it
Dropping down with the tide we arrived the same evening alongside the
guardship at Sheerness and being desirous of making ourselves snug
and of landing two unfortunate friends whom we had originally promised
to send ashore at Gravesend we made fast to a Government buoy and
remained in smooth water till the following morning
The Iris cutter belongs to the RYS and is the sistervessel of the
Corsair She was built by Ratsey for the late Mr Fleming with whom
she was a great favourite and for whom she won many valuable prizes
From England to the Mediterranean she safely bore her first master many
times but with flowing canvass and with rapid keel at last enticed him
once too often from his native shore for during a cruise in the
Mediterranean after many months of pain he died while gazing on her
Passing through several hands serving all equally well in gale or calm
she came at last into the possession of Lord R who has travelled
farther and made more extraordinary voyages in her than any member of
the Squadron and in spite of all improvements adopted of late years in
yachtbuilding there are but few if any vessels of seventyfive tons
that can surpass her in speed and symmetrical beauty or in the buoyant
ease with which she has encountered the fiercest storms
Her crew consisted of seven or eight regular seamen a sailingmaster
mate cook steward and a boy to assist him A fine Newfoundland dog
called Sailor and a droll little ringtail monkey called Jacko
also joined in the mess forard Lord R with Captain P and
myself made up the entire complement
On Sunday morning the 2nd at eleven as the church bells of Sheerness
were chiming a merry peal we commenced preparations for our departure
by sending our two friends off in the jollyboat in which they must
have got pretty wet for a sea was running sufficiently high to cause
them some little discomfort After a gloomy days work we reached
Harwich and at nine in the evening rested again in five fathoms water
We rose betimes the following day and strolled about the town in search
of stores We collected on board every kind of preserved meat and
vegetable one could think of and every kind of wine from champagne
down to cherry cordial the taste of man could relish We had milk too
in pots and mint for our peasoup lard in bladders and butter both
fresh and salt in jars flour and suet which we kept buried in the
flour a hundred stalks of horseradish for roast beef and raisins
citron and currants for plumpudding
We had rifles and guns to shoot bears and wolves and large rods large
as small maypoles to catch salmon and small rods to secure the bait
We had fishingtackle which when unwound went all the way into the
after cabin and then back again ten times round the main cabin
We had waterproof boots reaching up to the hips for wading the
rivers and Indiarubber pilotjackets for keeping the chest and back
secure from the spray of foss or wave Indeed we had all that the
heart of man could wish and all that his judgment could devise
I contrived before the day had passed to become very sick of Harwich
and myself for of all dull holes in this kingdom of England does not
this one claim the superlative degree Tuesday the 4th still found me
on the same spot gazing on the two lighthouses and to enhance my
gaiety R and P went to Ipswich to see a schooner yacht being
built for an old friend of R and at that moment on the stocks They
returned laden with turnips carrots radishes and cabbages The
luckless schooner was rated in great styleberths too numerous and
cabin not lofty enough A fiddle also was bought today for Jerome a
sailor who though selftaught had some idea of music and afterwards
wiled away in Norway and on the ocean during the calm evenings many
a weary hour by playing to us some of Old Englands most plaintive
airs
The following day came and went in the same monotonous fashion as its
predecessor since I find its events recorded thusFine daynothing
new Went ashore Bought fish mutton and beef Eat all the fish and
some of the beef Wind ESE
Thursday dawned beautifully calm and not a cloud was visible between
earth and the blue Heaven As I paced up and down the deck yet damp
with dew I thought the serenity of the morning emblematic of our future
wanderingsand was I wrong As the sun gained altitude and power the
water became rippled with a light air and nine oclock found us fairly
under weigh
There was not a heavy heart on board even Jacko chirupped and
swinging by his tail from the bowsprit shroud revelled in the warm
sunshine Being desirous of showing the exuberance of our spirits
R who had observed an old dame and her maid plying in a wherry
round the cutterprobably to take a nearer view of our beautiful craft
and her adventurous crew or perhaps to breathe the morning air I know
not whichordered the two quarter swivels to be loaded and watching
his opportunity when the cautious wherry came rather near fired both
of them right over the old ladys black bonnet and sent the wad fizzing
and smoking into the servantgirls lap I need not describe the alarm
of the old woman nor the shriek of the young one but the grin of the
wellseasoned tar who rowed coupled with his efforts to keep the fair
freight quiet where he had stowed it were worth our whole cargo
We shipped from this port a man named King who was to act as
interpreter He had been in Norway and was well acquainted with the
people and language having been for many previous years of his life
employed in the lobster fisheries He proved a most willing honest
goodtempered servant and a most useful linguist
The wind being light the Iris found it tough work in stemming the
strong tide which sets into Harwich but we contrived at halfpast
eleven to pass Orfordness Light At six the breeze having easternd a
little and increased till it became what sailors term pleasant we
lost sight of Lowestoff and lastly being this days work as well as
for the information of all nautical men we sounded at halfpast seven
on Smiths Knoll in seven fathoms
Friday morning the 7th dawned upon our glorious craft dashing through
the water in great style with a moderate breeze from S to SSE As I
cast my eye round the horizon and descried no land thoughts of old
days crowded to my recollection when I left home for the first time
and England for the West Indies How all the high hopes of youth had
vanished and how unaltered my condition now from what it was then
Had an angel come down from Heaven and told me twelve years ago when
I a boy stood on the hencoop of a West Indiaman gazing at the Lizard
that I should be the same creature in feeling and condition I should
have questioned the prophecy But the wind is fair and this is no time
for sorrowful thoughts
Hardup the helm Dick said D
Ay ay sir
SteadySo
Steady sir
Some man there heave the lead and down it went rushing in
fiveandtwenty fathoms on the Silver Pits At nine the vessel was hove
to and we tried our lines for fish but did not succeed We filled on
her again and stood away as before to the NE At two oclock while
we were trying our lines for the second time I felt suddenly
squeamish and in spite of the splendid weather and pure air wished
myself most heartily in the middle of Bondstreet or any the most
ignoble alley in the neighbourhood of Leicestersquare I closed my eyes
and fancied myself seated on a bench in the Green Park watching the
sheep browsing round me and listening to the rumbling of carriages as
they passed along Piccadilly I opened my eyes the vision fades and
lo
Nil nisi pontus et aer
However I plucked up courage and remained on deck until halfpast six
when the gafftopsail was unbent and the topmast struck D the
sailingmaster anticipating no good from the calm and the dense fog
which had succeeded a fine wind and cheerful sunshine
Early in the morning about four oclock I was awakened by a good deal
of laughing and shuffling of feet on deck and by an occasional thump
as if a cargo of pumpkins was being taken on board
I leaped out of my berth and putting my head above the companion saw
all the men who composed the watch hard at work with their
fishinglines and the maindeck covered with several large codfish
Witnessing the pugnacity of one or two fish when they were hauled out of
the water I turned in again for it was no easy matter to stand the
swell increasing as we got more on the Dogger Bank
While we were at breakfast eating cods sound and talking of smoked
salmon the sailingmaster came below and told us a small vessel was in
sight and by running down to her we might speak her and send letters
home by her Of course all the married men commenced scratching in
great style both paper and their pates and in a shorter time than could
be imagined made up a small mail The more strenuously however we
endeavoured to approach the vessel the more she bore away and being a
long way to the eastward of us and going before the wind with her
squaresail set it was doubtful whether we should fetch her At last
we fancied she mistook us for pirates for I must confess we looked
suspicious and the squadron ensign flying at the peak made our cutter
appear more warlike and determined than she really was By eleven
notwithstanding our friends manAuvring we were pretty close to her
and lowering the dingy as quickly as possible two men were ordered to
pull to the strange smack and ascertaining her destination to deliver
the letters This last action on our part took the poor craft by
surprise for it was curious to observe the pertinacity with which this
little vessel avoided our boat although we used every stratagem devised
by seafaring men to allay the consternation of the weak such as the
waving of our caps the hoisting of pacific signals the lowering of our
gafftopsail c c nor could she be persuaded of our amicable
intentions before poor King had shouted at the top of his lungs that
we were Englishmen in search of pleasure and destined for no marauding
purpose
She turned out to be what our glasses had anticipated at daylight a
Norwegian laden with dried fish and bound to the coast of Holland
and therefore our letters were brought back
Scarcely had the incident I have just mentioned come to a conclusion
than another sail just emerging from the horizon was discovered on our
weather bow We rubbed our hands plucked our caps over the forehead
and walked up and down the deck more briskly than ever for there is no
man who has not been to sea can imagine the feelings of sailors when
far from land a sail is seen
Every minute now brought us closer and at two PM we had come
within hail There was little wind but a nasty short sea was running
and it was comical in the extreme to observe each man endeavouring to
steady himself and place his hands to his mouth for the purpose of
hailing when a sudden swell would send him rolling over Sailors hutch
or seat him gently on the skylight behind After a little trouble the
speakingtrumpet was found and brought on deck and by its assistance a
communication was opened with the vessel She was a large Norwegian
bark from Christiansand and bound to London To our request that they
would take charge of some letters the captain leaning over the
weatherquarter assented in a loud Norwegian dialect The question
which now arose was how were we to get the said letters on board but
necessity being here established as the mother of invention gave a
prompt answer P holding the letters in his hand desired that a
potato might be brought The largest from the store was presented It
was then lashed with a piece of twine to the letters now transposed
into a tidy brownpaper parcel which P balancing in the palm of
his left hand suggested was not of sufficient weight to reach the ship
We were not long at a loss for the cook appeared grim and smiling
with a tolerablesized coal exposed to view and approbation between his
thumb and forefinger Side by side like a fairhaired youth with his
swarthy bride the coal and potato were placed and P poising for
the second time the precious parcel rolled up his shirtsleeve and
throwing himself well back hurled with all the elegance of a Parthian
coal potato and parcel toward the Norwegian captains head But
horror the potato and coal combined proved rather too heavy and
retaining their impetus longer than intended carried the luckless
brownpaper bundle over the leeside and into the North Sea
The ship immediately backed her mainyard and lowering one of her
stern boats sent her off in search of the unhappy letters but having
rowed about for some time without catching a glimpse of coal paper or
potato the search was abandoned and the boat came alongside of us
After delivering another packet of brown paper and presenting each man
there were four with a bottle of brandy we parted company with mutual
good wishes conveyed through our interpreter King not omitting sundry
wellmeaning gesticulations telegraphed between the fat Norwegian
captain on the weather quarter and ourselves This was the first
specimen we had met with of northern kindness and although we had
heard a great deal of their unaffected goodness of heart this act of
civility made no slight impression upon us At four oclock while our
Norwegian bark was just hull down the gafftopsail was taken in a
strong SE wind with rain having arisen The wind still increasing at
seven the first reef in the mainsail was also taken in jibs shifted
and the bowsprit reefed
During the rest of the evening I was a martyr to all the miseries of
seasickness and stretched at full length on the cabin sofa I closed
my eyes and allowing my thoughts to wander where they would hoped to
cheat myself out of my present discomfort but nausea like no other ill
to which we are subservient is not to be pacified and I lay the whole
night sensible of the keenest pain

Sunday the 9th dawned on us tossed about on a troubled sea indeed
for a strong wind was blowing from ESE However at eight oclock
just before breakfast we sounded in thirtyfive fathoms We had
scarcely concluded this cautious operation before the wind began to
lull and after conjecturing both from our calculations and soundings
that land was not far away we were confirmed in this opinion by a thick
fog rising above the horizon on our lee beam We went to dinner in great
glee and in spite of the hazy atmosphere which now surrounded us
compensation was felt and accepted by us at the hour of six when a
perfect calm prevailed and our peasoup and curry were threatened for
the first time this week to be demolished in that gentlemanly and
collected mode which the usages of society had rendered familiar to our
observation in England
At eleven oclock at night the haziness cleared away and in about half
an hour afterwards a light was seen It was imagined to be the light at
the mouth of the Christiansand Fiord the name of which amidst the
bustle and joyousness of the moment I could but indistinctly learn and
cannot now remember As midnight approached our old friend the fog
gathered density and effectually deprived us of the slightest glimpse
of the light and we retired to rest ill at ease plunged into the vale
of anxiety in the same ratio as we had been exalted on the peaks of
expectation and joy
Sunday at sea retains all the monotony of the shore for the waves seem
to show deference to the day and move their crests with more solemnity
and order while the sailors gather round the vessels bows and in a
group listen with wrapt attention to the sublime and poetic sentences
of prophetic Isaiah
I cannot in all my wanderings at sea call to mind a tempestuous
Sabbath nor the sailors who would profane it Mark them How solemnly
the shadow of thought hangs over their countenances and how with cheek
cradled on the hand with pipes unsmoked in their mouths leaning over
the bulwarks their eyes intently riveted on the clear distant horizon
as carried away by the inspiration and fervour of the great prophet a
messmate who reads with energy of gesture ever and anon raises his
voice which by its tremulous intonation tells the deep feeling of his
heart and the quickness with which its pulse vibrates in answer to the
burning words he utters aloud
Monday the 10th the most lovely of May mornings fanned by the softest
of south winds Land in all its grandeur of mountain and of cloud lay
before me the towering peaks of the mountains capped with everlasting
snow and piercing an atmosphere of the intensest blue
I sat down on the afterlockers and looked with swelling heart on the
sublime scene As far as the eye could reach inland mountain over
mountain extending round half the horizon the land of old Norway I
had read of in my earliest years expanded itself On my left hand the
Naze hung frowning over the Northern Ocean How memory in a moment
rushed back to the quaint schoolroom at Ditton and its still quainter
little bookcases huddled up in one corner where and whence I first
began to pronounce and find the Lindsnes
Just at this instant poor old Sailor who had been poking his nose
over the vessels side and snuffing and whining rushed up to me and
placing his head in my lap turned his eyes towards my face and looked
as much as to say Are we not near our journeys end and dont I smell
the land Little Jacko too came out of his crib and chirped and
chattered and scratched himself and rolled about on the deck in the
sunniest corners and then all of a sudden up he would jump and
seizing hold of Sailors tail pull it as if he was hauling taut the
weather runner How everything was replete with life and how happiness
without the hearts reservation was written on every face I cannot
conceive anything more exhilarating than a beautiful morning at sea and
land in sight I could have passed the remaining portion of my life
without a pang of sorrow or a gush of joy but with equanimity on this
dark blue wave surpassed only in its dark dye and eternity by the dome
on which it looked
When I returned upon deck after breakfast the first object that
attracted my attention was the helmsman He smiled as soon as his eye
met mine and raised in recognition his Spanishlooking hat He was a
stout tall faircomplexioned man with a mild expression of
countenance blue eyes a long straightpointed nose high cheekbones
and light flaxen hair flowing down almost to his shoulders He made some
observation to me in a dialect which sounded as being a mixture of
German Celtic and English but the sense of it was incomprehensible
Norway I said in reply pointing to the land now not three miles from
us
Ja ja he answered and turning to King our interpreter begged in
the Norwegian language that some of the sails might be trimmed
I need not say he was the pilot who had come on board to take us up to
Christiansand His dress differed not from the ordinary costume of our
own pilots but I could not help gazing on him with a feeling of mystery
and interest which cannot easily be described His whole appearance bore
a close resemblance to all I had read and seen in pictures of the
Esquimaux and now I have formed their acquaintance personally I feel
assured that the Norwegians are a branch of that family
The scenery the nearer we approached the shore heightened in grandeur
Though we were now not a mile from the most bold and formidable rocks
no harbour or creek of any kind could be seen where we might find
shelter yet our northern guide continued to point out with his finger
and explain as well as he could in his strange but harmonious idiom the
mouth of the Fiord up which we were to proceed to Christiansand
The rocks along this coast of Norway are terrific the sea breaking and
rushing upon them with tremendous noise and fury Nor do the waves ever
rest peaceably here for the tides of the North Sea and of the Cattegat
both meet together at this point of the Sleeve and cause a fearful
swell which when aided at times by the wind rises to such a great
height that vessels are obliged to run for protection into some of the
smaller fiords abounding in this quarter
It was now midday and the sun shone with more heat than I had felt in
the tropics Indeed everything around us reminded one so vividly of a
tropical climate that it required some resolution to keep imagination
in subserviency The thermometer was at 80 on deck and our
goodtempered pilot told us it was manga varm in August
At one oclock the gallant Iris might be seen gliding along with her
accustomed speed and elegance in smooth water up the Christiansand
Fiord As we sailed along we would now and then catch a glimpse of large
and small vessels in all directions in full sail wending their way
through the tributary fiords to some town in the interior On each side
of us rose from the surface of the water perpendicularly into the clear
sky mountains of solid stone covered to their very summits with no
other vegetation than the fir which springs out of the crevices of the
rocks We pursued our course for many miles amidst the grandest scenery
changing like a panorama at every point of land round which the vessel
wound and amidst the most profound silence which is a peculiarity of
these fiords Ever and anon the gulls in flocks of thousands would
soar into the air only the flapping of their wings echoing through
these silent mountains
At three oclock as we sailed round an enormous rock about a mile high
with not a tree or shrub of any sort on its surface the town of
Christiansand burst upon the view
We had no sooner anchored and the sails were not yet furled when
Captain P who was an inveterate sportsman went ashore to gather
what intelligence he could about the salmon fishing it being for that
