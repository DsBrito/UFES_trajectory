sailing with calmer weather through the dangerous region of the Scilly
Islands where over a mass of rocks and reefs a warning lighthouse
stood After sunset the last land was seen to disappear under the
horizon the promontory Landsend On the next day the cables which
usually are on the capstan were coiled on deck still greater waves
and more violent motions of the ship indicated that the vessels had
reached the great ocean Who may be the master of the ocean was made
evident during the very next few days to the astonished soldiers when a
Danish and later two Swedish East Indian ships were passing through the
fleet these then lowered their flags and a sail of the middle mast as
soon as they were within the distance of a shot This was the mark of
esteem which every foreign ship on meeting an English manofwar or
squadron in the Atlantic Ocean was to render to it as indicating the
recognition of Great Britains sovereignty there
A perfect calm had set in the great waves rose to an astonishing
height and although at a time of wind and full sail the vibrations of
the ships are lessened by the quick forward motion yet in calm the
opposite is true for the ships were heaving and pitching so that there
seemed to be danger of complete capsizing or at any rate of the loss of
the masts In the darkness of night the foam sparkled on the ships and
at times the lightning flashed and quivered on the waves Several ships
had already met with accidents in getting badly damaged by running
against each other and in some the constant pumping out of water was
made necessary The ship Good Intent ran with its prow into the stern of
the Claudina on which there was a company of the regiment von
Knyphausen under Lieutenant Baum and to the great anguish and cry of
the crew and troops made a great hole over the cabin The ship
Speedwell on which there was LieutenantColonel Block with the
GrenadierCompany of the Prince Karl regiment drew so much water that it
seemed doomed to sink Accordingly signals of distress were hoisted the
Commodore signaled the fleet to halt and by means of several boats had
the ship thoroughly investigated It became evident that there was no
immediate danger and that with constant use of the pumps the
Speedwell could continue the voyage
On the 20th of May a strong wind suddenly arose simply good fresh air
as the sailors said but the water became rough the waves struck over
the decks and all fires were ordered to be put out porpoises made
their appearance in great numbers the sight of which was cheering
especially to the officers who shot at them little was it supposed by
them then that these porpoises were but the forerunners of an
approaching storm On the 25th the whole sky became clouded over with
dark and heavy clouds the air became close and sultry and the
Commodore had shots fired frequently as a signal to prevent the
scattering of the ships The wind and waves became more violent from
hour to hour during the night of the 25th to the 26th and on Whitsunday
the full force of the storm was felt The Commodore gave the signal to
draw in all sails except one and to remove the uppermost parts of the
masts The ships were being scattered far apart In the cabins all
articles though tied fast were broken loose and were thrown
helterskelter the occupants likewise many with bruised limbs and
there was no end to the spells of seasickness and of misery made
ridiculous The storm was ever growing worse On the second day the last
sail was drawn in and the rudder bound fast so that now the ship was
left to its fate The raging sea was playing with the gigantic
structure of the ships as with a toy sailors were swallowed up by the
waters others committed suicide and soldiers who ventured to go on deck
fell down unconscious because of the force of the waves Only one
consolation remained namely the clarified atmosphere but on the third
day of Whitsuntide dark gloomy clouds and torrents of rain darkened the
whole firmament the winds seemed to be let loose sounding like roaring
thunder all nature seemed to have united in bringing to young America a
terrible funeral feast While thousands are pleading here for the
protection of Heaven a furious wrathful indignation rages in the
American pulpit scattering its curses and praying to God and the
Savior dedicates the fleet to destruction
With a loud and deafening roar the huge waves wash over the ships the
decks and every porthole had to be made extra tight The soldiers were
lying in the lower compartments as if buried alive in coffins gasping
in the darkness after air and water from moment to moment the most of
them quiet and depressed expected to go out of this dark night into
the eternal day of heaven Still on the next day the storm was raging
and the heavy sea also continued and this threatened to break the ships
to pieces but the clouds broke the great downfall of rain ceased the
air became clear the wind subsided and in the evening at 10 oclock
the storm had stopped entirelyonly the seething waters were still
roaring and placed the ships in even greater danger It was not until
the morning of the 30th that this violent sea had spent its fury sound
sleep reinvigorated exhausted nature and when the soldiers and sailors
awoke to the beautiful day and looked out upon the glittering smooth
quiet sea and saw how little by little the ships drew closer together
they each and everyone felt as if they had awakened to a new day of
creation The kitchen fires were again glowing the kettles were
steaming the provisions clothing and bed linen all so thoroughly wet
through were dried everywhere repairs were undertaken the masts were
again properly set up and the sails spread on the decks praises to God
were sung with fervent feelings of gratitude in devout meetings of
prayer
The religious sympathetic feelings certainly prevail in the deeply
rooted piety of our Hessian people It was customary on all ships that
as often as the weather and the motion of the vessel permitted it a
prayer meeting should be held every morning and every evening and a
preaching service on Sundays Though not obliged to attend yet one
could regularly see the soldierly religious congregation assembled
standing with uncovered heads and filled with devotion drawn thither by
the inner voice of conscience If the sea were rough then one could hear
the people from their resting places starting up religious hymns
Communion with God was necessary for the soul more urgently did the
present remind of eternity and the very recent past give grounds for
gratitude The ordinary man had in lieu of other songs learned to sing
his religious hymns at school and he sang these even during his march
against the enemy It was not a book of epic poems that accompanied him
on his expeditions it was a small book of prayer which even now is a
chief constituent part of the small bookshops of the Hessian
peasantfolk so precious to him because of the divine power of its
influence to his mind a pure old genuine Jesus wine This was the
well known Habermannchen the epic poem and the private chapel of the
warrior as well as of the serving man And not alone with the exalted
spectacle of divine omnipotence on the furious or rapturous seabut
even in the camps and quarters the masses of soldiers did not neglect
public worship any more than they neglected a simple military duty So
with the ancient fear of God of the patriarchs in their hearts the
Hessian people landed on the soil of America
The dispersion of the fleet had obliged a halt of three days during
which time the frigates sailed in all directions collecting the ships
by means of cannon shots yet this was not entirely successful fifteen
battered ships had opened their sealed orders and had sailed on ahead to
Halifax the goal designated therein The contrary winds prevented the
advance of the fleet It appeared in great grandeur on the 4th of June
this was the birthday of King George III In unusual splendor did the
day shine on all vessels the red English flag was waving on all war
ships and all frigates twentyone cannon shots resounded at noon and
the transport ships were only too glad to follow with their joyful
celebrations But on the ship Unanimity an unfortunate pistol shot was
fired in the morning A captain of the lifeguards Count von der Lippe
offended one of his subordinates Lieutenant Kleinschmidt because he
though accidentally had caused his dog to give a cry of pain and with
coarse words demanded an immediate pistol duel without witnesses The
lieutenant gave his opponent a mortal wound The one was descended from
a sovereign house the other of humble civil origin yet according to
the ancient chivalrous views which at all times prevail in the military
profession they were equals The courtmartial also in consequence
thereof acquitted the lieutenant This is the proceeding followed in
accordance with all proper army regulations the highest officer next to
the count takes the lieutenants sword places a sentinel over him made
a request by means of a speakingtrumpet of the commodore whose ship
fortunately was quite near for a clever English surgeon as the Hessian
Army generally had but few well qualified army surgeons and then takes
a boat to the ship Elizabeth to make a report to the LieutenantGeneral
Immediately a courtmartial is ordered Lieutenant Kleinschmidt under
arrest is taken to the ship of the staff of the regiment and the
staffsurgeonmajor and the chief staffchaplain were sent to the count
The former could do nothing except to leave the dying man to the
services of the latter In prayer with the chaplain during which time a
religious service was being held on deck the count departed this life
Thereupon the adjutants of the general took an inventory of the effects
of the deceased an autopsy was held to determine the cause of death
then dressed in his military suit placed into a hammock weighted down
with stone and sewed in white canvas without any further formality
his body was consigned to the sea
Dense fogs had fallen in order to keep the ships together frequent
shots were fired from the commodores ship the danger of knocking
against one another was unavoidable The ships Happy Jeanette and
Henrietta because of the carelessness on the part of the former ran
against each other at a time when the winds were strong and the sails
were set full so that the latter very nearly capsized and
hardpressed by the former could not again right itself On all faces
there was the picture of death and panic arose The soldiers of the
regiment von Ditfurth driven to despair endeavored to leap upon the
Jeanette and those of the regiment Prince Karl tried to save their lives
on the Happy and only with difficulty were they prevented from doing an
act of foolhardiness which would have cost the lives of many After
repeated knocks the two ships were finally parted in the Henrietta a
great hole had been madeonly one foot lower down and in a few minutes
nothing more would have been seen of the ship There were on this ship
Captain von Malsburg the Lieutenants von Ditfurth von Malsburg von
Bardeleben and Ensign von Schachten
A new drama took place soon after the 10th of June A frigate brought
the orders to set all ships and cannon in defensive condition an East
Indian ship had reported the proximity of many American privateers One
of these had even been captured The Hessian officers thereupon set all
cannon in order and arranged for the distribution of the men in the case
of an attack The commodore remained now in the middle of the fleet a
frigate had to stay at the head in his place and the others had to be
all the more active everywhere in the fleet as commodores messengers
to keep up the order and to search every strange vessel Even the
transport vessels received orders in case they should discover a strange
vessel to display a red flag at the stern of the ship until the
commodore by means of a similar signal has indicated that he has taken
cognizance of the information Almost to the very tops of the masts the
guards on watch could be seen More frequently than ever the stragglers
now received the usual warning always with a fine of money imposed
namely several sharp cannon shots which struck close to them The same
was the case with those ships which sailed too fast in advance of the
others As soon as the commodore had given the signal by means of the
flaglanguage one could see the marines and the sailors on the
menofwar practice fully armed and equipped and with such great zeal
carry on a naval battle exercise as certainly cannot be shown any better
in a real battle By means of bags of sand the decks were protected
against cannon shot from the side back of these men with muskets at
different places the auxiliary troops at the middle mast the chief
sentry between the masts a sort of pile structure for defense was built
up to accommodate smaller cannon and soldiers with uncommon dexterity
the artillery was managed and at last the sailors with lances and other
like weapons hurried on deck to drill for defense in order to prevent
the enemy from mounting the ship
With many a change of wind and weather of calm and turbulent sea of
joyous or anxious feeling the great sandbanks of New Foundland were
reached on the 20th of June
A mighty sea of breakers indicates the location of these sandbanks upon
their precipitous rocky walls covered forty fathoms high by the sea the
restless ocean waves are beating and are with a like force repelled The
winds go howling over them dense cold fogs always cover these regions
In order to warm the ships against colliding the drums foghorns and
ship bells were resounding day and night on all ships In order to
prevent their being separated too far from one another a cannon shot was
fired every half hour on the commodores ship Nevertheless many ships
drifted from their course fourteen of them were found by a fire ship
and conducted to Halifax For three or four days the ships remained in
the vicinity of the sandbanks The many phenomena seen there increased
the astonishment of the ordinary man concerning the wonders of the sea
which had here appeared to him the whale swimming majestically and
the spongy mass polyps scarcely with the organization of a living
creature multitudes of porpoises which pursued with amusing leaps out
of the water the course of the flying fish and the latter then fell
down upon the decks where they found a more certain death shoals of
dolphins which followed the ships with their glittering colors and
often were reached by the harpoon or other weapon thrown at them in the
dark night countless brilliant fiery stripes generated by a school of
fishes swiftly passing through the waters turtles caught for the
tables of the gentlemen whole swarms of wild ducks above all the
enormous quantity of cod fish which had caused several fleets of
French British and Norwegian fishing smacks to be gathered here and
now enriched the kitchens of the army fleet
On the 25th of June the sandbanks were left behind and from the damp
biting cold against which even the protection of a fur mantle was of no
avail the expedition experienced a warm beautiful day and soon again
many changes of weather The great number of whales now to be seen
indicated the proximity of the coast of Nova Scotia A green fir tree
which was floating on the waters brought still more joyful tidings The
ever diminishing depth of the sea on July 3rd gave rise to the hope that
yet before evening land would come into sight but as heavy fogs and
strong winds set in it became necessary to avoid the probable dangers by
returning to the deeper ocean Ever following a course of approaching
and then leaving the coast and experiencing another heavy thunder
storm which tore the sails to pieces it was with indescribable joy
that the coast of Nova Scotia came to view on the 7th at break of day
As soon as the anchoring place of Halifax was reached the commodore
signaled to the fleet to gather and sail before the wind Now those
ships came along and rejoined the fleet which had become lost in the
fogs and had anchored several days previously in the harbor They
greeted the commodore with fifteen shots and he replied with eleven
From these ships much information was gained and especially did they
bring joyful news about the ship Malaga which had become totally lost
to all appearances in the Whitsuntide storm and which with all on
board a company of the lifeguards under Captain Waldenberg had
already been given up as lost Its bowsprit was gone and it had suffered
considerable damage too but it had had the good fortune to bring to
Halifax a French ship which was carrying munitions of war to the
Americans A reward of 2000 pounds sterling had been granted to the
commander and his troopsbut in course of time this was paid out to the
commanders of the English menofwar Having joined the great British
fleet it had followed the commander in chief General Howe to the new
rendezvous of the squadron and of the army
Howe had already begun his career with blunders and perplexities He had
been selected through an unfortunate vote conducted by his party and so
was entrusted with an affair the nature of which demanded in the midst
of the transactions of considerate love the speediest progress of arms
and the greatest decision of character Instead of leaving Boston the
firebrand of the war so important because of its location either not
at all or at such an early time that the state of New York which was
still chiefly loyal could be saved he started for Halifax so
inopportunely that meanwhile the power of the Congress was made felt in
New York and prepared there the strongest defence Howe finally made
Rhode Island his destination and changed his mind during the trip and
at last aimed for New York when the commodore William Hotham
collected before Halifax the previously given sealed orders from the
several ship captains and had designated Rhode Island as the new
destination a frigate brought the again changed instruction to fix as
rendezvous the lighthouse of Sandy Hook
The joy of immediate landing after so long a voyage which had even
become highly disagreeable towards the close was now gone The various
changes as to their destination the unfavorable weather poor sailing
vessels which oftentimes had to be taken in tow by the war vessels and
the difficulty to keep together such a fleet always in danger of
hostile attack all combined to lengthen the voyage to 100 days which
was even at that time very rare and now could be of incalculable
advantage to the cause of the Americans With an unfavorable wind the
fleet started the eyes of everybody were directed to the green coast
and the undulating hilly background During the night the sharp glow of
the Halifax lighthouse accompanied the troops until like a star
gradually fading away it at last disappeared from view
On the evening of the 8th of July the fleet halted The ship Spring had
by means of a signal of distress and four cannon shots indicated that
it was in the greatest danger All menofwar approached it They
learned that the sailors had mutinied whereupon these were arrested
and then exchanged for others With a changeable wind the fleet
continued now tacking now sailing To one of the ships the
threatening gigantic cone of a water spout approached yet it escaped
the danger of being overcome by its great deluge of water elsewhere the
socalled St Elmos Fire appeared at the tops of the masts feared as
an apparition of a warning spirit then on the night of the 11th to the
12th of July the sky and the ocean met the spectacle of a most fearful
thunder storm The ships kept at a great distance from each other drew
in their sails and while generally on the commodores ship the light
signal was burning now on all ships the lanterns could be seen unlit
vibrating in the deepest darkness the clouds at night gave forth a most
violent hailstorm the terrible waves roared and piled themselves up
into great fierylooking mountains the lightning flashed and quivered
in the air now and then splintering the top of a mast With thunder on
all sides and fearful in the expectation of the approaching storm the
soldiers sank down in silent resignation and the crew remained during
the whole night on deck in anxious agitation and work In the morning
there arose a strong wind which tore to pieces the sails on several
ships but it also dispersed the storm clouds Then on the 14th a calm
set in and from the ships there resounded the hymns of the Sunday
services but dense fog and continuous rains occurred and the vibrations
of the ship became in the calm ever greater All at once there was a
great outcry in the fleet Two ships the Hartley with Knyphausen
soldiers under Captain von Biesenrod and Lord Sandwich on board of
which was Colonel von Wurmb and a part of the life guards could be seen
colliding because of the great waves causing each other considerable
damage and thereupon the ship Henrietta with the Union upon which
there was Colonel von Herringen and a section of the regiment of
Losberg could be seen likewise driven against each other Alternately
heaving and sinking the upper ship always appeared as if threatening
destruction to the lower one until the Union hoisted out a boat which
then by means of a rope thrown over the bowsprit pulled the Henrietta
away After a few agreeable days there followed on the 19th of July very
stormy weather the sea was in a most furious rage sails ripped apart
but the ever agile activity of the sailors at the time of such
accidents was always ready with instant relief and reparation As a
spider that moves about as swiftly as the arrow in her web so the
sailors were going up and down the rope ladders of the masts and through
the rigging hanging only at their feet tieing the tackle and binding
the sails Then there followed days and nights too hot to be endured
with heavy thunder storms sleepless and famishing for a little fresh
air the soldiers came even in the night time on deck the longing for
the land grew hour by hour
This most tedious voyage had given full play to the development of
diseases The most careful cleanliness the daily scrubbing of the
decks the frequent cleaning of the cabins and rooms the washing and
the disinfecting with steaming vinegar the pumping in of fresh air and
the airing of the bedding on decks all this belonged to the general
health regimen yet the effect of the restrained often unnatural
physical exercises and improper food was not to be suppressed While
to many a Hessian the ship became his first cradle without granting
unto him in its hasty course a place which he could call his birthplace
there were others who deceased were buried at the bottom of the sea
the Ensign von Stedel of the Regiment von Donop among the first
victims Scurvy was developed as a result of tainted humors for which
the drinking of sea water was used as a medicine and also the chewing
of tobacco which the Hessians had learned from the sailors and later
kept up as a habit in their own homes The disease reigned supreme
however and many individuals suffered for a long time yet after the
disembarkation from paralyzed limbs and some even died There was a
lack of the most necessary things The food supplies provided for by the
officers themselves were exhausted even the rations of zwieback were
cut down to only 17 loth 812 oz a day The water which in the
whole fleet had been stored in new oaken casks became undrinkable and
finally putrid The beds of the soldiers were broken up in the storms
camp kettles and canteens were smashed tents clothing apparel even
the cartridges had been destroyed by the rats which finally had even
gnawed through the water casks all of these troubles more or less were
suffered by most of the transport ships
Meanwhile a much wished for wind filled the sails and the ever more and
more anxious but daily disappointed hope now at last to see New York
grew upon its wings yet the wind on the 30th of July became so strong
that the sails had to be drawn in the rudders bound fast and the ships
left to the shattering blows of the waves which roaringly dashed and
resounded about the ships As soon as the storm had subsided the
commodore by means of the cannon shots gathered together the scattered
fleet and gave instructions for a changed course in order to avoid being
driven against the near coast but unfortunately the ships came into a
strong contrary current the water again became high and turbulent it
rained and lightened incessantly masts toppled over as was the case on
the Friendship which had on board 200 members of the Regiment Crown
Prince besides Colonel von Hachenberg Sailors and ship carpenters
found everywhere enough to do until finally a favorable strong wind on
the 4th of August fortunately blew the fleet out of the current On the
10th of August the fleet offered an excellent and very hopeful
appearance as it in a most speedy wind with high towering sails was
cutting its course through the little waves On the 11th at the hour
of noon the happy signals indicating the sight of land were to be seen
Soon the charming coast of Long Island came into the view of all and
great shouts of joy were wafted across the waters towards it from this
swimming city Carefully did the fleet tack during the night because the
water was becoming ever more shallow On the next morning the 12th of
August an English squadron of 24 vessels was seen from the ocean and
this after a few hours united with the fleet following the mutual
greeting by means of a definite number of shots Among the new arrivals
was also Major General von Mirbach with the troops which also belonged
to the first Hessian Division and which did not take to the transport
ships at Bremerlehe until four weeks after the embarkation of Heister
and then had waited for a favorable wind
Now the English flag was unfurled on all ships Sandy Hook came into
sight with its white lighthouse immediately thereupon Staten Island
and a veritable painting spread itself out before the eyes of these
newcomers most charming after so many dangers had been encountered and
after so long a denial of a glance on the beautiful smiling landscapes
teeming with inhabitants exalted and majestic the shores studded with
troops the tents of a friendly and a hostile camp of a forest of masts
of 500 ships and the many hundred boats which so vigilantly were
watching the hostile shoreshere a belligerent power assembled such
as America had never seen before in order to have a combat which in the
destiny of the world gave its immeasurable decision
Extract from the Diary of the German Poet and
Adventurer J G Seume a Hessian Soldier
and Participator on the Voyage
On the English transporter we were pressed and packed like salted
herrings To save room the deck low as it was had been partitioned
off and we lay instead of in hammocks in these bunks one row above
the other The deck was so low that a grown man could not stand upright
and the bunks not high enough to sit in These bunks were intended to
hold six men each but after four had entered the remaining two could
only find room by pressing in The situation was especially in warm
weather decidedly not cool for one man to turn from one side to the
other alone was absolutely impossible and to lie on ones back was an
equal impossibility The straightest way and the hardest edge were
necessary After having roasted and sweated sufficiently on one side
the man who had the place to the extreme right would call round about
turn and all would simultaneously turn to the other side then having
received quantum sabis on this one the man to the left would give the
same signal The maintainance was on an equal scale Today bacon and
peaspeas and bacon tomorrow Once in a while this menu was broken by
porridge or peeled barley and as an occasional great feast by pudding
This pudding was made of musty flour half salt and half sweet water and
of very ancient mutton suet The bacon could have been from four to five
years old was black at both outer edges became yellow a little farther
on and was white only in the very centre The salted beef was in a very
similar condition The biscuits were often full of worms which we had to
swallow in lieu of butter or dripping if we did not want to reduce our
scanty rations still more Besides this they were so hard that we were
forced to use canon balls in breaking them into eatable pieces Usually
our hunger did not allow us to soak them and often enough we had not
the necessary water to do so We were told and not without some
probability of truth that these biscuits were French and that the
English during the Seven Years War had taken them from French ships
Since that time they had been stored in some magazine in Portsmouth and
that they were now being used to feed the Germans who were to kill the
French under Rochambeau and Lafayette in Americaif God so wotted But
apparently God did not seem to fancy this idea much
The heavily sulphured water lay in deep corruption After a barrel had
been hoisted up and opened the deck was pervaded by a conglomeration of
very evil odours indeed It was full of worms as long as a finger and
had to be filtered through a cloth before it could be drunken And even
then it was dangerous to breathe above it Rum and sometimes a little
strong beer helped to make it somewhat more drinkable
Herded together in this manner forced to breathe putrid air to eat bad
food and to drink foul water these youths old men students merchants
and peasants many of them but insufficiently clothed were tossed about
for months upon the Atlantic
Many of the sufferings undergone by us on this voyage were no doubt
unavoidable and many of the recruits were used to a hard
lifenevertheless many of the things they endured were the result of
an intentional deficiency of care taking and of a great greed
What can be said of the British QuartermastersDepartment which sent
these people to sea without proper food and drink What of the Duke of
Brunswick who sent his subject to Canada without durable boots or
stockings and without overcoats Often enough have men borne a hard life
cheerfully because they knew the why and wherefore but these poor
fellows suffered on account of a quarrel which was not their own
suffered only that their masters might pay their debts or enjoy new
pleasures
