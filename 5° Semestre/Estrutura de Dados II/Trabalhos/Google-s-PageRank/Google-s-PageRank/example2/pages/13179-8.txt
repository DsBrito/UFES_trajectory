MISCELLANEOUS
PRELUDE
The mighty poets from their flowing store
Dispense like casual alms the careless ore
Through throngs of men their lonely way they go
Let fall their costly thoughts nor seem to know
Not mine the rich and showering hand that strews
The facile largess of a stintless Muse
A fitful presence seldom tarrying long
Capriciously she touches me to song
Then leaves me to lament her flight in vain
And wonder will she ever come again
AUTUMN
Thou burden of all songs the earth hath sung
Thou retrospect in Times reverted eyes
Thou metaphor of everything that dies
That dies illstarred or dies beloved and young
And therefore blest and wise
O be less beautiful or be less brief
Thou tragic splendour strange and full of fear
In vain her pageant shall the Summer rear
At thy mute signal leaf by golden leaf
Crumbles the gorgeous year
Ah ghostly as remembered mirth the tale
Of Summers bloom the legend of the Spring
And thou too flutterest an impatient wing
Thou presence yet more fugitive and frail
Thou most unbodied thing
Whose very being is thy going hence
And passage and departure all thy theme
Whose life doth still a splendid dying seem
And thou at height of thy magnificence
A figment and a dream
Stilled is the virgin rapture that was June
And cold is Augusts panting heart of fire
And in the stormdismantled forestchoir
For thine own elegy thy winds attune
Their wild and wizard lyre
And poignant grows the charm of thy decay
The pathos of thy beauty and the sting
Thou parable of greatness vanishing
For me thy woods of gold and skies of grey
With speech fantastic ring
For me to dreams resigned there come and go
Twixt mountains draped and hooded night and morn
Elusive notes in wandering wafture borne
From undiscoverable lips that blow
An immaterial horn
And spectral seem thy winterboding trees
Thy ruinous bowers and drifted foliage wet
Past and Future in sad bridal met
O voice of everything that perishes
And soul of all regret
WORLDSTRANGENESS
Strange the world about me lies
Never yet familiar grown
Still disturbs me with surprise
Haunts me like a face half known
In this house with starry dome
Floored with gemlike plains and seas
Shall I never feel at home
Never wholly be at ease
On from room to room I stray
Yet my Host can neer espy
And I know not to this day
Whether guest or captive I
So between the starry dome
And the floor of plains and seas
I have never felt at home
Never wholly been at ease
WHEN BIRDS WERE SONGLESS
When birds were songless on the bough
I heard thee sing
The world was full of winter thou
Wert full of spring
Today the worlds heart feels anew
The vernal thrill
And thine beneath the rueful yew
Is wintry chill
THE MOCK SELF
Few friends are mine though many wights there be
Who meeting oft a phantasm that makes claim
To be myself and hath my face and name
And whose thin fraud I wink at privily
Account this light impostor very me
What boots it undeceive them and proclaim
Myself myself and whelm this cheat with shame
I care not so he leave my true self free
Impose not on me also but alas
I too at fault bewildered sometimes take
Him for myself and far from mine own sight
Torpid indifferent doth mine own self pass
And yet anon leaps suddenly awake
And spurns the gibbering mime into the night
THY VOICE FROM INMOST DREAMLAND CALLS
Thy voice from inmost dreamland calls
The wastes of sleep thou makest fair
Bright oer the ridge of darkness falls
The cataract of thy hair
The morn renews its golden birth
Thou with the vanquished night dost fade
And leavst the ponderable earth
Less real than thy shade
IN LALEHAM CHURCHYARD
AUGUST 18 1890
Twas at this season year by year
The singer who lies songless here
Was wont to woo a less austere
Less deep repose
Where Rotha to Winandermere
Unresting flows
Flows through a land where torrents call
To faroff torrents as they fall
And mountains in their cloudy pall
Keep ghostly state
And Nature makes majestical
Mans lowliest fate
There mid the August glow still came
He of the twiceillustrious name
The loud impertinence of fame
Not loth to flee
Not loth with brooks and fells to claim
Fraternity
Linked with his happy youthful lot
Is Loughrigg then at last forgot
Nor silent peak nor dalesmans cot
Looks on his grave
Lulled by the Thames he sleeps and not
By Rothas wave
Tis fittest thus for though with skill
He sang of beck and tarn and ghyll
The deep authentic mountainthrill
Neer shook his page
Somewhat of worldling mingled still
With bard and sage
And twere less meet for him to lie
Guarded by summits lone and high
That traffic with the eternal sky
And hear unawed
The everlasting fingers ply
The loom of God
Than in this hamlet of the plain
A less sublime repose to gain
Where Nature genial and urbane
To man defers
Yielding to us the right to reign
Which yet is hers
And nigh to where his bones abide
The Thames with its unruffled tide
Seems like his genius typified
Its strength its grace
Its lucid gleam its sober pride
Its tranquil pace
But ah not his the eventual fate
Which doth the journeying wave await
Doomed to resign its limpid state
And quickly grow
Turbid as passion dark as hate
And wide as woe
Rather it may be overmuch
He shunned the common stain and smutch
From soilure of ignoble touch
Too grandly free
Too loftily secure in such
Cold purity
But he preserved from chance control
The fortress of his stablisht soul
In all things sought to see the Whole
Brooked no disguise
And set his heart upon the goal
Not on the prize
With those Elect he shall survive
Who seem not to compete or strive
Yet with the foremost still arrive
Prevailing still
Spirits with whom the stars connive
To work their will
And ye the baffled many who
Dejected from afar off view
The easily victorious few
Of calm renown
Have ye not your sad glory too
And mournful crown
Great is the facile conqueror
Yet haply he who wounded sore
Breathless unhorsed all covered oer
With blood and sweat
Sinks foiled but fighting evermore
Is greater yet
THE FLIGHT OF YOUTH
Youth ere thou be flown away
Surely one last boon today
Thoult bestow
One last light of rapture give
Rich and lordly fugitive
Ere thou go
What thou canst not What all spent
All thy spells of ravishment
Powrless now
Gone thy magic out of date
Gone all gone that made thee great
Follow thou
NAY BID ME NOT MY CARES TO LEAVE
Nay bid me not my cares to leave
Who cannot from their shadow flee
I do but win a short reprieve
Scaping to pleasure and to thee
I may at best a moments grace
And grant of liberty obtain
Respited for a little space
To go back into bonds again
A CHILDS HAIR
A letter from abroad I tear
Its sheathing open unaware
What treasure gleams within and there
Like bird from cage
Flutters a curl of golden hair
Out of the page
From such a frolic head twas shorn
Tis but five years since he was born
Not sunlight scampering over corn
Were merrier thing
A child A fragment of the morn
A piece of Spring
Surely an ampler fuller day
Than drapes our English skies with grey
A deeper light a richer ray
Than here we know
To this bright tress have given away
Their living glow
For Willie dwells where gentian flowers
Make mimic sky in mountain bowers
And vineyards steeped in ardent hours
Slope to the wave
Where storied Chillons tragic towers
Their bases lave
And over piny tracts of Vaud
The rose of eve steals up the snow
And on the waters far below
Strange sails like wings
Halfbodilessly come and go
Fantastic things
And tender night falls like a sigh
On chalet low and chateau high
And the far cataracts voice comes nigh
Where no man hears
And spectral peaks impale the sky
On silver spears
Ah Willie whose dissevered tress
Lies in my handmay you possess
At least one sovereign happiness
Evn to your grave
One boon than which I ask naught less
Naught greater crave
May cloud and mountain lake and vale
Never to you be trite or stale
As unto souls whose wellsprings fail
Or flow defiled
Till Natures happiest fairytale
Charms not her child
For when the spirit waxes numb
Alien and strange these shows become
And stricken with lifes tedium
The streams run dry
The choric spheres themselves are dumb
And dead the sky
Dead as to captives grown supine
Chained to their task in sightless mine
Above the bland day smiles benign
Birds carol free
In thunderous throes of life divine
Leaps the glad sea
But theytheir day and night are one
What ist to them that rivulets run
Or what concern of theirs the sun
It seems as though
Their business with these things was done
Ages ago
Only at times each dulled heart feels
That somewhere sealed with hopeless seals
The unmeaning heaven about him reels
And he lies hurled
Beyond the roar of all the wheels
Of all the world
On what strange track ones fancies fare
To eyeless night in sunless lair
Tis a far cry from Willies hair
And here it lies
Human yet something which can neer
Grow sad and wise
Which when the head where late it lay
In lifes grey dusk itself is grey
And when the curfew of lifes day
By death is tolled
Shall forfeit not the auroral ray
And eastern gold
THE KEYBOARD
Fiveandthirty black slaves
Halfahundred white
All their duty but to sing
For their Queens delight
Now with throats of thunder
Now with dulcet lips
While she rules them royally
With her fingertips
When she quits her palace
All the slaves are dumb
Dumb with dolour till the Queen
Back to Court is come
Dumb the throats of thunder
Dumb the dulcet lips
Lacking all the sovereignty
Of her fingertips
Dusky slaves and pallid
Ebon slaves and white
When the Queen was on her throne
How you sang tonight
Ah the throats of thunder
Ah the dulcet lips
Ah the gracious tyrannies
Of her fingertips
Silent silent silent
All your voices now
Was it then her life alone
Did your life endow
Waken throats of thunder
Waken dulcet lips
Touched to immortality
By her fingertips
SCENTLESS FLOWRS I BRING THEE
Scentless flowrs I bring theeyet
In thy bosom be they set
In thy bosom each one grows
Fragrant beyond any rose
Sweet enough were she who could
In thy hearts sweet neighbourhood
Some redundant sweetness thus
Borrow from that overplus
ON LANDORS HELLENICS
Come hither who grow cloyed to surfeiting
With lyric draughts oersweet from rills that rise
On Hybla not Parnassus mountain come
With beakers rinsed of the dulcifluous wave
Hither and see a magic miracle
Of happiest science the bland Attic skies
Truemirrored by an English wellno stream
Whose heavenbelying surface makes the stars
Reel with its restless idiosyncrasy
But well unstirred save when at times it takes
Tribute of lovers eyelids and at times
Bubbles with laughter of some sprite below
TO
WITH A VOLUME OF EPIGRAMS
Unto the Lady of The Nook
Fly tiny book
There thou hast loverseven thou
Fly thither now
Seven years hast thou for honour yearned
And scant praise earned
But ah to win at last such friends
Is full amends
ON EXAGGERATED DEFERENCE TO
FOREIGN LITERARY OPINION
What and shall we with such submissive airs
As age demands in reverence from the young
Await these crumbs of praise from Europe flung
And doubt of our own greatness till it bears
The signet of your Goethes or Voltaires
We who alone in latter times have sung
With scarce less power than Arnos exiled tongue
We who are Miltons kindred Shakespeares heirs
The prize of lyric victory who shall gain
If ours be not the laurel ours the palm
More than the froth and flotsam of the Seine
More than your Hugoflare against the night
And more than Weimars proud elaborate calm
One flash of Byrons lightning Wordsworths light
ENGLAND TO IRELAND
FEBRUARY 1888
Spouse whom my sword in the olden time won me
Winning me hatred more sharp than a sword
Mother of children who hiss at or shun me
Curse or revile me and hold me abhorred
Heiress of anger that nothing assuages
Mad for the future and mad from the past
Daughter of all the implacable ages
Lo let us turn and be lovers at last
Lovers whom tragical sin hath made equal
One in transgression and one in remorse
Bonds may be severed but what were the sequel
Hardly shall amity come of divorce
Let the dead Past have a royal entombing
Oer it the Future built white for a fane
I that am haughty from much overcoming
Sue to thee supplicatenay is it vain
Hate and mistrust are the children of blindness
Could we but see one another twere well
Knowledge is sympathy charity kindness
Ignorance only is maker of hell
Could we but gaze for an hour for a minute
Deep in each others unfaltering eyes
Love were begunfor that look would begin it
Born in the flash of a mighty surprise
Then should the ominous nightbird of Error
Scared by a sudden irruption of day
Flap his maleficent wings and in terror
Flit to the wilderness dropping his prey
Then should we growing in strength and in sweetness
Fusing to one indivisible soul
Dazzle the world with a splendid completeness
Mightily single immovably whole
Thou like a flame when the stormy winds fan it
I like a rock to the elements bare
Mixed by loves magic the fire and the granite
Who should compete with us what should compare
Strong with a strength that no fate might dissever
One with a oneness no force could divide
So were we married and mingled for ever
Lover with lover and bridegroom with bride
MENSIS LACRIMARUM
MARCH 1885
March that comes roaring maned with rampant paws
And bleatingly withdraws
Marchtis the years fantastic nondescript
That born when frost hath nipped
The shivering fields or tempest scarred the hills
Dies crowned with daffodils
The month of the renewal of the earth
By mingled death and birth
But England in this latest of thy years
Call itthe Month of Tears
UNDER THE DARK AND PINY STEEP
Under the dark and piny steep
We watched the storm crash by
We saw the bright brand leap and leap
Out of the shattered sky
The elements were ministring
To make one mortal blest
For peal by peal you did but cling
The closer to his breast
THE BLIND SUMMIT
A Viennese gentleman who had climbed the HochKonig
without a guide was found dead in a sitting posture near the
summit upon which he had written It is cold and clouds shut
out the viewVide the Daily News of September 10 1891
So mounts the child of ages of desire
Man up the steeps of Thought and would behold
Yet purer peaks touched with unearthlier fire
In sudden prospect virginally new
But on the lone last height he sighs Tis cold
And clouds shut out the view
