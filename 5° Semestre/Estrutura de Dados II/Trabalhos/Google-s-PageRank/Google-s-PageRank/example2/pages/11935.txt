Mysticism in English Literature
Chapter I
Introduction
Mysticism is a term so irresponsibly applied in English that it has
become the first duty of those who use it to explain what they mean by
it The Concise Oxford Dictionary 1911 after defining a mystic as
one who believes in spiritual apprehension of truths beyond the
understanding adds whence mysticism n often contempt
Whatever may be the precise force of the remark in brackets it is
unquestionably true that mysticism is often used in a semicontemptuous
way to denote vaguely any kind of occultism or spiritualism or any
specially curious or fantastic views about God and the universe
The word itself was originally taken over by the Neoplatonists from the
Greek mysteries where the name of Greek mystes given to the
initiate probably arose from the fact that he was one who was gaining a
knowledge of divine things about which he must keep his mouth shut
Greek myo  close lips or eyes Hence the association of secrecy or
mystery which still clings round the word
Two facts in connection with mysticism are undeniable whatever it may
be and whatever part it is destined to play in the development of
thought and of knowledge In the first place it is the leading
characteristic of some of the greatest thinkers of the worldof the
founders of the Eastern religions of Plato and Plotinus of Eckhart and
Bruno of Spinoza Goethe and Hegel Secondly no one has ever been a
lukewarm an indifferent or an unhappy mystic If a man has this
particular temperament his mysticism is the very centre of his being
it is the flame which feeds his whole life and he is intensely and
supremely happy just so far as he is steeped in it
Mysticism is in truth a temper rather than a doctrine an atmosphere
rather than a system of philosophy Various mystical thinkers have
contributed fresh aspects of Truth as they saw her for they have caught
glimpses of her face at different angles transfigured by diverse
emotions so that their testimony and in some respects their views are
dissimilar to the point of contradiction Wordsworth for instance
gained his revelation of divinity through Nature and through Nature
alone whereas to Blake Nature was a hindrance and Imagination the
only reality But all alike agree in one respect in one passionate
assertion and this is that unity underlies diversity This their
startingpoint and their goal is the basic fact of mysticism which in
its widest sense may be described as an attitude of mind founded upon
an intuitive or experienced conviction of unity of oneness of
alikeness in all things From this source springs all mystical thought
and the mystic of whatever age or country would say in the words of
Krishna
There is true knowledge Learn thou it is this
To see one changeless Life in all the Lives
And in the Separate One Inseparable
The BhagavadGita Book 18
This fundamental belief in unity leads naturally to the further belief
that all things about us are but forms or manifestations of the one
divine life and that these phenomena are fleeting and impermanent
although the spirit which informs them is immortal and endures In other
words it leads to the belief that the Ideal is the only Real
Further if unity lies at the root of things man must have some share
of the nature of God for he is a spark of the Divine Consequently man
is capable of knowing God through this godlike part of his own nature
that is through his soul or spirit For the mystic believes that as the
intellect is given us to apprehend material things so the spirit is
given us to apprehend spiritual things and that to disregard the spirit
in spiritual matters and to trust to reason is as foolish as if a
carpenter about to begin a piece of work were deliberately to reject
his keenest and sharpest tool The methods of mental and spiritual
knowledge are entirely different For we know a thing mentally by
looking at it from outside by comparing it with other things by
analysing and defining it whereas we can know a thing spiritually only
by becoming it We must be the thing itself and not merely talk about
it or look at it We must be in love if we are to know what love is we
must be musicians if we are to know what music is we must be godlike if
we are to know what God is For in Porphyrys words Like is known
only by like and the condition of all knowledge is that the subject
should become like to the object So that to the mystic whether he be
philosopher poet artist or priest the aim of life is to become like
God and thus to attain to union with the Divine Hence for him life
is a continual advance a ceaseless aspiration and reality or truth is
to the seeker after it a vista ever expanding and charged with ever
deeper meaning John Smith the Cambridge Platonist has summed up the
mystic position and desire in one brief sentence when he says Such as
men themselves are such will God Himself seem to them to be For as
it takes two to communicate the truth one to speak and one to hear so
our knowledge of God is precisely and accurately limited by our capacity
to receive Him Simple people says Eckhart conceive that we are to
see God as if He stood on that side and we on this It is not so God
and I are one in the act of my perceiving Him
This sense of unity leads to another belief though it is one not always
consistently or definitely stated by all mystics It is implied by Plato
when he says All knowledge is recollection This is the belief in
preexistence or persistent life the belief that our souls are
immortal and no more came into existence when we were born than they
will cease to exist when our bodies disintegrate The idea is familiar
in Wordsworths Ode on the Intimations of Immortality
Finally the mystic holds these views because he has lived through an
experience which has forced him to this attitude of mind This is his
distinguishing mark this is what differentiates him alike from the
theologian the logician the rationalist philosopher and the man of
science for he bases his belief not on revelation logic reason or
demonstrated facts but on feeling on intuitive inner knowledge
He has felt he has seen and he is therefore convinced but his
experience does not convince any one else The mystic is somewhat in the
position of a man who in a world of blind men has suddenly been
granted sight and who gazing at the sunrise and overwhelmed by the
glory of it tries however falteringly to convey to his fellows what
he sees They naturally would be sceptical about it and would be
inclined to say that he is talking foolishly and incoherently But the
simile is not altogether parallel There is this difference The mystic
is not alone all through the ages we have the testimony of men and
women to whom this vision has been granted and the record of what they
have seen is amazingly similar considering the disparity of personality
and circumstances And further the world is not peopled with totally
blind men The mystics would never hold the audience they do hold were
it not that the vast majority of people have in themselves what William
James has called a mystical germ which makes response to their
message
Jamess description of his own position in this matter and his feeling
for a Beyond is one to which numberless unmystical people would
subscribe He compares it to a tune that is always singing in the back
of his mind but which he can never identify nor whistle nor get rid of
It is he says very vague and impossible to describe or put into
words Especially at times of moral crisis it comes to me as the
sense of an unknown something backing me up It is most indefinite to
be sure and rather faint And yet I know that if it should cease there
would be a great hush a great void in my life1
This sensation which many people experience vaguely and intermittently
and especially at times of emotional exaltation would seem to be the
first glimmerings of that secret power which with the mystics is so
finely developed and sustained that it becomes their definite faculty of
vision We have as yet no recognised name for this faculty and it has
been variously called transcendental feeling imagination mystic
reason cosmic consciousness divine sagacity ecstasy or
vision all these meaning the same thing But although it lacks a
common name we have ample testimony to its existence the testimony of
the greatest teachers philosophers and poets of the world who
describe to us in strangely similar language
That serene and blessed mood
In which  the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended we are laid asleep
In body and become a living soul
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony and the deep power of joy
We see into the life of things
Tintern Abbey
Harmony and Joy it may be noted are the two words used most
constantly by those who have experienced this vision
The mystic reverses the ordinary methods of reasoning he must believe
before he can know As it is put in the Theologia Germanica He who
would know before he believeth cometh never to true knowledge Just as
the sense of touch is not the faculty concerned with realising the
beauty of the sunrise so the intellect is not the faculty concerned
with spiritual knowledge and ordinary intellectual methods of proof
therefore or of argument the mystic holds are powerless and futile
before these questions for in the words of Tennysons Ancient Sage
Thou canst not prove the Nameless O my son
Nor canst thou prove the world thou movest in
Thou canst not prove that thou art body alone
Nor canst thou prove that thou art spirit alone
Nor canst thou prove that thou art both in one
Thou canst not prove thou art immortal no
Nor yet that thou art mortalnay my son
Thou canst not prove that I who speak with thee
Am not thyself in converse with thyself
For nothing worthy proving can be proven
Nor yet disproven
Symbolism is of immense importance in mysticism indeed symbolism and
mythology are as it were the language of the mystic This necessity
for symbolism is an integral part of the belief in unity for the
essence of true symbolism rests on the belief that all things in Nature
have something in common something in which they are really alike In
order to be a true symbol a thing must be partly the same as that which
it symbolises Thus human love is symbolic of divine love because
although working in another plane it is governed by similar laws and
gives rise to similar results or falling leaves are a symbol of human
mortality because they are examples of the same law which operates
through all manifestation of life Some of the most illuminating notes
ever written on the nature of symbolism are in a short paper by R L
Nettleship2 where he defines true mysticism as the consciousness
that everything which we experience every fact is an element and
only an element in the fact ie that in being what it is it is
significant or symbolic of more In short every truth apprehended by
finite intelligence must by its very nature only be the husk of a deeper
truth and by the aid of symbolism we are often enabled to catch a
reflection of a truth which we are not capable of apprehending in any
other way Nettleship points out for instance that bread can only be
itself can only be food by entering into something else
assimilating and being assimilated and that the more it loses itself
what it began by being the more it finds itself what it is intended
to be If we follow carefully the analysis Nettleship makes of the
action of bread in the physical world we can see that to the man of
mystic temper it throws more light than do volumes of sermons on what
seems sometimes a hard saying and what is at the same time the ultimate
mystical counsel He that loveth his life shall lose it
It is worth while in this connection to ponder the constant use Christ
makes of nature symbolism drawing the attention of His hearers to the
analogies in the law we see working around us to the same law working in
the spiritual world The yearly harvest the sower and his seed the
leaven in the loaf the grain of mustardseed the lilies of the field
the action of fire worms moth rust bread wine and water the
mystery of the wind unseen and yet felteach one of these is shown to
contain and exemplify a great and abiding truth
This is the attitude these are the things which lie at the heart of
mysticism In the light of this nothing in the world is trivial
nothing is unimportant nothing is common or unclean It is the feeling
that Blake has crystallised in the lines
To see a world in a grain of sand
And a Heaven in a wild flower
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour
The true mystic then in the full sense of the term is one who knows
there is unity under diversity at the centre of all existence and he
knows it by the most perfect of all tests for the person concerned
because he has felt it True mysticismand this cannot be
overemphasisedis an experience and a life It is an experimental
science and as Patmore has said it is as incommunicable to those who
have not experienced it as is the odour of a violet to those who have
never smelt one In its highest consummation it is the supreme adventure
of the soul to use the matchless words of Plotinus it is the flight
of the Alone to the Alone
As distinguished therefore from the mystical thinker or philosopher
the practical mystic has direct knowledge of a truth which for him is
absolute He consequently has invariably acted upon this knowledge as
inevitably as the blind man to whom sight had been granted would make
use of his eyes
Among English writers and poets the only two who fulfil this strict
definition of a mystic are Wordsworth and Blake But we are not here
concerned primarily with a study of those great souls who are mystics
in the full and supreme sense of the word For an examination of their
lives and vision Evelyn Underhills valuable book should be consulted
Our object is to examine very briefly the chief English writersmen of
letters and poetswhose inmost principle is rooted in mysticism or
whose work is on the whole so permeated by mystical thought that their
attitude of mind is not fully to be understood apart from it
Naturally it is with the poets we find the most complete and continuous
expression of mystical thought and inspiration Naturally because it
has ever been the habit of the English race to clothe their profoundest
thought and their highest aspiration in poetic form We do not possess a
Plato a Kant or a Descartes but we have Shakespeare and Wordsworth
and Browning And further as the essence of mysticism is to believe
that everything we see and know is symbolic of something greater
mysticism is on one side the poetry of life For poetry also consists
in finding resemblances and universalises the particulars with which it
deals Hence the utterances of the poets on mystical philosophy are
peculiarly valuable The philosopher approaches philosophy directly the
poet obliquely but the indirect teaching of a poet touches us more
profoundly than the direct lesson of a moral treatise because the
latter appeals principally to our reason whereas the poet touches our
transcendental feeling
So it is that mysticism underlies the thought of most of our great
poets of nearly all our greatest poets if we except Chaucer Dryden
Pope and Byron Shakespeare must be left on one side first because
the dramatic form does not lend itself to the expression of mystical
feeling and secondly because even in the poems there is little real
mysticism though there is much of the fashionable Platonism
Shakespeare is metaphysical rather than mystical the difference being
roughly that the metaphysician seeks to know the beginnings or causes
of things whereas the mystic feels he knows the end of things that all
nature is leading up to union with the One
We shall find that mystical thought and the mystical attitude are
curiously persistent in English literature and that although it seems
out of keeping with our John Bull character the English race has a
marked tendency towards mysticism What we do find lacking in England is
the purely philosophical and speculative spirit of the detached and
unprejudiced seeker after truth The English mind is antispeculative
it cares little for metaphysics it prefers theology and a given
authority English mystics have as a rule dealt little with the
theoretical side of mysticism the aspect for instance with which
Plotinus largely deals They have been mainly practical mystics such as
William Law Those of the poets who have consciously had a system and
desired to impart it have done so from the practical point of view
urging like Wordsworth the importance of contemplation and meditation
or like Blake the value of cultivating the imagination and in both
cases enforcing the necessity of cleansing the inner life if we are to
become conscious of our divine nature and our great heritage
For the sake of clearness this thought may first be traced very briefly
as it appears chronologically it will however be considered in
detail not in order of time but according to the special aspect of
Being through which the writer felt most in touch with the divine life
For mystics unlike other thinkers scientific or philosophical have
little chronological development since mystic truths can neither age
nor die So much is this the case that passages of Plotinus and
Tennyson of Boehme and Law of Eckhart and Browning may be placed side
by side and be scarcely distinguishable in thought Yet as the race
evolves certain avenues of sensation seem to become more widely opened
up This is noticeable with regard to Nature Love Beauty Wisdom and
Devotion these have been welltrodden paths to the One ever since the
days of Plato and Plotinus but with the great exception of St Francis
of Assisi and his immediate followers we have to wait for more modern
times before we find the intense feeling of the Divinity in Nature which
we associate with the name of Wordsworth It is in the emphasis of this
aspect of the mystic vision that English writers are supreme Henry
Vaughan Wordsworth Browning Richard Jefferies Francis Thompson and
a host of other poetseers have crystallised in immortal words this
illuminated vision of the world
The thought which has been described as mystical has its roots in the
East in the great Oriental religions The mysterious secret taught by
the Upanishads is that the soul or spiritual consciousness is the only
source of true knowledge The Hindu calls the soul the seer or the
knower and thinks of it as a great eye in the centre of his being
which if he concentrates his attention upon it is able to look
outwards and to gaze upon Reality The soul is capable of this because
in essence it is one with Brahman the universal soul The apparent
separation is an illusion wrought by matter Hence to the Hindu matter
is an obstruction and a deception and the Eastern mystic despises and
rejects and subdues all that is material and bends all his faculties on
realising his spiritual consciousness and dwelling in that
This type of thought certainly existed to some extent in both Greece
and Egypt before the Christian era Much of Platos thought is mystical
in essence and that which be points out to be the motive force of the
philosophic mind is also the motive force of the mystic namely the
element of attraction and so of love towards the thing which is akin to
him The illustration of the dog being philosophic because he is angry
with a stranger but welcomes his friend3 though at first it may seem
like many of Platos illustrations farfetched or fanciful in truth
goes to the very root of his idea Familiarity akinness is the basis
of attraction and affection The desire of wisdom or the love of
beauty is therefore nothing but the yearning of the soul to join itself
to what is akin to it This is the leading conception of the two great
mystical dialogues the Symposium and the Phaedrus In the former
Socrates in the words of the stranger prophetess Diotima traces the
path along which the soul must travel and points out the steps of the
ladder to be climbed in order to attain to union with the Divine From
beauty of form and body we rise to beauty of mind and spirit and so to
the Beauty of God Himself
He who under the influence of true love rising upward from these
begins to see that beauty is not far from the end And the true
order of going or being led by another to the things of love is to
use the beauties of earth as steps along which he mounts upwards
for the sake of that other beauty going from one to two and from
two to all fair forms and from fair forms to fair practices and
from fair practices to fair notions until from fair notions he
arrives at the notion of absolute beauty and at last knows what
the essence of beauty is This  is that life above all others
which man should live in the contemplation of beauty absolute4
That is a passage whose music reechoes through many pages of English
literature especially in the poems of Spenser Shelley and Keats
Plato may therefore be regarded as the source of speculative mysticism
in Europe but it is Plotinus his disciple the Neoplatonist who is
the father of European mysticism in its full sense practical as well as
speculative and who is also its most profound exponent Plotinus AD
204270 who was an Egyptian by birth lived and studied under Ammonius
Sakkas in Alexandria at a time when it was the centre of the
intellectual world seething with speculation and schools teachers and
philosophies of all kinds Platonic and Oriental Egyptian and
Christian Later from the age of forty he taught in Rome where he was
surrounded by many eager adherents He drew the form of his thought both
from Plato and from Hermetic philosophy his conception of Emanation
but its real inspiration was his own experience for his biographer
Porphyry has recorded that during the six years he lived with Plotinus
the latter attained four times to ecstatic union with the One
Plotinus combined in unusual measure the intellect of the
metaphysician with the temperament of the great psychic so that he was
able to analyse with the most precise dialectic experiences which in
most cases paralyse the tongue and blind the discursive reason His
sixth Ennead On the Good or the One is one of the great philosophic
treatises of the world and it sums up in matchless words the whole
mystic position and experience There are two statements in it which
contain the centre of the writers thought God is not external to any
one but is present in all things though they are ignorant that he is
so God is not in a certain place but wherever anything is able to
come into contact with him there he is present Enn vi 9 SecSec 4 7
It is because of our ignorance of the indwelling of God that our life is
discordant for it is clashing with its own inmost principle We do not
know ourselves If we did we would know that the way home to God lies
within ourselves A soul that knows itself must know that the proper
direction of its energy is not outwards in a straight line but round a
centre which is within it Enn vi 9 Sec 8
The whole Universe is one vast Organism Enn ix 4 SecSec 32 45 and
the Heart of God the source of all life is at the centre in which all
finite things have their being and to which they must flow back for
there is in this Organism so Plotinus conceives a double circulatory
movement an eternal outbreathing and inbreathing the way down and
the way up The way down is the outgoing of the undivided One towards
manifestation From Him there flows out a succession of emanations The
first of these is the Nous or OverMind of the Universe God as
thought The Mind in turn throws out an image the third Principle in
this Trinity the Soul of all things This like the Nous is
immaterial but it can act on matter It is the link between man and
God for it has a lower and a higher side The lower side desires a
body and so creates it but it is not wholly incarnate in it for as
Plotinus says the soul always leaves something of itself above
From this World Soul proceed the individual souls of men and they
partake of its nature Its nature is triple the animal or sensual soul
closely bound to the body the logical reasoning human soul and the
intellectual soul which is one with the Divine Mind from whence it
comes and of which it is an image
Souls have forgotten then divine origin because at first they were so
delighted with their liberty and surroundings like children let loose
from their parents says Plotinus that they ran away in a direction as
far as possible from their source They thus became clogged with the
joys and distractions of this lower life which can never satisfy them
and they are ignorant of their own true nature and essence In order to
return home the soul has to retrace the path along which she came and
the first step is to get to know herself and so to know God See
Enn vi 9 Sec 7 Thus only can she be restored to the central unity
of the universal soul This first stage on the upward path is the
purgative life which includes all the civic and social virtues gained
through general purification selfdiscipline and balance with at the
same time a gradual attainment of detachment from the things of sense
and a desire for the things of the spirit
The next step is to rise up to mind Enn v 1 Sec 3 to the world of
pure thought the highest unity possible to a selfconscious being This
is often called the illuminative life and it might be summed up as
concentration of all the facultieswill intellect feelingupon God
And lastly comes the unitive life which is contemplation the intense
desire of the soul for union with God the momentary foretaste of which
has been experienced by many of the mystics This last stage of the
journey home the supreme Adventure the ascension to the One above
thought this cannot be spoken of or explained in words for it is a
state beyond words it is a mode of vision which is ecstasy When the
soul attains to this state the One suddenly appears with nothing
between and they are no more two but one and the soul is no more
conscious of the body or of whether she lives or is a human being or an
essence she knows only that she has what she desired that she is where
no deception can come and that she would not exchange her bliss for the
whole of Heaven itself paraphrased from Enn vi 7 Sec 24
The influence of Plotinus upon later Christian mysticism was immense
though mainly indirect through the writings of two of his spiritual
disciples St Augustine 354450 and the unknown writer probably of
the early sixth century possibly a Syrian monk who ascribes his works
to Dionysius the Areopagite the friend of St Paul The works of
Dionysius were translated from Greek into Latin by the great Irish
philosopher and scholar John Scotus Erigena Eriugena and in that
form they widely influenced later mediaeval mysticism
The fusion of Eastern mysticism with Christianity finally brought about
the great change which constitutes the difference between Eastern and
Western mysticism a change already foreshadowed in Plato for it was
in part the natural outcome of the Greek delight in material beauty but
finally consummated by the teachings of the Christian faith Eastern
thought was pure soulconsciousness its teaching was to annihilate the
flesh to deny its reality to look within and so to gain
enlightenment Christianity on the other hand was centred in the
doctrine of the Incarnation in the mystery of God the Father revealing
Himself in human form Hence the human body human love and
relationships became sanctified became indeed a means of revelation of
the divine and the mystic no longer turned his thoughts wholly inwards
but also outwards and upwards to the Father who loved him and to the
Son who had died for him Thus in the West mystical thought has ever
recognised the deep symbolism and sacredness of all that is human and
natural of human love of the human intellect and of the natural
world All those things which to the Eastern thinker are but an
obstruction and a veil to the Western have become the very means of
spiritual ascent5 The ultimate goal of the Eastern mystic is summed
up in his assertion I am Brahman whereas the Western mystic
believes that he who sees the Infinite in all things sees God
In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the mystical tradition was
carried on in France by St Bernard 10911153 the Abbot of Clairvaux
and the Scotch or Irish Richard of the Abbey of St Victor at Paris and
in Italy among many others by St Bonaventura 12211274 a close
student of Dionysius and these three form the chief direct influences
on our earliest English mystics
England shares to the full in the wave of mystical experience thought
and teaching which swept over Europe in the fourteenth and early
fifteenth centuries and at first the mystical literature of England as
also of France Germany Italy and Sweden is purely religious or
devotional in type prose treatises for the most part containing
practical instruction for the inner life written by hermits priests
and anchoresses In the fourteenth century we have a group of such
writers of great power and beauty and in the work of Richard Rolle
Walter Hilton Julian of Norwich and the author of the Cloud of
Unknowing we have a body of writings dealing with the inner life and
the steps of purification contemplation and ecstatic union which throb
with life and devotional fervour
From the time of Julian of Norwich who was still alive in 1413 we
find practically no literature of a mystical type until we come to
Spensers Hymns 1596 and these embody a Platonism reached largely
through the intellect and not a mystic experience It would seem at
first sight as if these hymns or at any rate the two later ones in
honour of Heavenly Love and of Heavenly Beauty should rank as some of
the finest mystical verse in English Yet this is not the case They are
saturated with the spirit of Plato and they express in musical form the
lofty ideas of the Symposium and the Phaedrus that beauty more
nearly than any other earthly thing resembles its heavenly prototype
and that therefore the sight of it kindles love which is the excitement
and rapture aroused in the soul by the remembrance of that divine beauty
which once it knew And Spenser following Plato traces the stages of
ascent traversed by the lover of beauty until he is caught up into
union with God Himself Yet notwithstanding their melody and their
Platonic doctrine the note of the real mystic is wanting in the
Hymns the note of him who writes of these things because he knows
them
It would take some space to support this view in detail Any one
desirous of testing it might read the account of transport of the soul
when rapt into union with the One as given by Plotinus Enn vi 9
Sec 10 and compare it with Spensers description of a similar experience
An Hymne of Heavenly Beautie 11 253273 Despite their poetic
melody Spensers words sound poor and trivial Instead of preferring to
dwell on the unutterable ecstasy contentment and bliss of the
experience he is far more anxious to emphasise the fact that all that
pleased earst now seemes to paine
The contradictory nature of his belief is also arresting In the early
part of the Hymne of Heavenly Beautie inspeaking of the glory of God
which is so dazzling that angels themselves may not endure His sight he
says as Plato does
The meanes therefore which unto us is lent
Him to behold is on his workes to looke
Which he hath made in beauty excellent
