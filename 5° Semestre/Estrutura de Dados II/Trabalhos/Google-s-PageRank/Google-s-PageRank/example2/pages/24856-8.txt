INTRODUCTION
It has long been the opinion of many of the more progressive teachers
of the United States that next to Herakles Odysseus is the hero
closest to childlife and that the stories from the Odyssey are
the most suitable for readinglessons These conclusions have been
reached through independent experiments not related to educational
work in foreign countries
While sojourning in Athens I had the pleasure of visiting the best
schools both public and private and found the reading especially
spirited I examined the books in use and found the regular
readingbooks to consist of the classic tales of the country the
stories of Herakles Theseus Perseus and so forth in the reader
succeeding the primer and the stories of Odysseus or Ulysses as
we commonly call him following as a third book answering to our
second or third reader This book I brought home with me and had a
careful literal translation made I submitted this translation to
that notable scholar Zenaide A Ragozin with whom I faithfully
traversed the ground word by word and sentence by sentence This
version I have carefully compared with Bryant and rewritten making
the language as simple as could be consistent with the dignity of
the subjectmatter
The introduction to the original book as I found it in Greece contains
many interesting points since it shows that educators in foreign
countries notably in Germany had come to the same conclusion with
our best American teachers The editor of the little Greek
readingbook says
In editing this work we have made use not only of Homers Odyssey
but also of that excellent reader which is used in the public schools
of Germany Willmans Lesebuch aus Homer We have divided the
little volume into three parts the first of which gives a short
resume of the war against Troy and the destruction of that city
the second the wanderings of Odysseus till his arrival in Ithaca
the third his arrival and the killing of the wooers We have no apology
to make in presenting this book to the public as a schoolbook since
many people superior to us have shown the need of such books in
schoolwork The new public schools as is well known have a mission
of the highest importance They do not aim as formerly at absolute
knowledge pounded into the heads of children in a mechanical way
Their aim is the mental and ethical development of the pupils Reading
and writing lead but half way to this goal With all nations the
readers used in the public schools are a collection of the noblest
thoughts of their authors
The Greek editor had never read the inane rat and cat stories of
American school readers when he wrote that He continues
Happily the Greek nation more than any other abounds in literary
masterpieces Nearly all of the Greek writings contain an abundance
of practical wisdom and virtue Their worth is so great that even
the most advanced European nations do not hesitate to introduce them
into their schools The Germans do this although their habits and
customs are so different from ours They especially admire Homers
works These books above all others afford pleasure to the young
and the reason for it is clearly set forth by the eminent educator
Herbart
The little boy is grieved when told that he is little Nor does
he enjoy the stories of little children This is because his
imagination reaches out and beyond his environments I find the
stories from Homer to be more suitable reading for young children
than the mass of juvenile books because they contain grand truths
Therefore these stories are held in as high esteem by the German
children as by the Greek In no other works do children find the grand
and noble traits in human life so faithfully and charmingly depicted
as in Homer Here all the domestic civic and religious virtues of
the people are marvellously brought to light and the national feeling
is exalted The Homeric poetry and especially the Odyssey is
adapted to very young children not only because it satisfies so well
the needs which lead to mental development but also for another
reason As with the people of olden times bravery was considered the
greatest virtue so with boys of this age and all ages No other
ethical idea has such predominance as that of prowess Strength of
body and a firm will characterize those whom boys choose as their
leaders Hence the pleasure they derive from the accounts of
celebrated heroes of yore whose bravery courage and prudence they
admire
The editor further extols the advantages arising from the study of
Homer it making the youthful students acquainted with the earliest
periods of Greek history the manners and customs of the people and
he ends by quoting from Herbart
Boys must first get acquainted with the noisy marketplace of Ithaca
and then be led to the Athens of Miltiades and Themistokles
With equal truth the American can say that the child whose patriotism
is kindled by the Homeric fire will the more gladly respond to the
ideals set forth in the history of a Columbus or a Washington

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE LIFE OF THE HERO ODYSSEUS
CHAPTER I
ABOUT TROY AND THE JOURNEY OF PARIS TO GREECE
On the northern shore of Asia Minor there lies a plateau watered by
many small rivers and surrounded on all sides by mountains only on
the north it slopes gently to the sea On this plateau between the
Simois and Scamandros rivers in the oldest times there stood a very
rich and powerful city whose name was Troy It was the capital of
a large and fertile district known as the Troad
There about 1200 BC reigned a king by the name of Priam possessed
of great power and boundless wealth He had many sons and daughters
It was said indeed that he had fifty sons who were all married and
living in their own homes which they had built by the kings wish
around the royal palace
They were all handsome and heroic young men One of the youngest
Paris also named Alexandros surpassed the others in beauty He was
a restless youth and not fond of his home as were the others He
had set his heart on travelling and seeing strange countries and
cities King Priam was extremely fond of his large family and took
pride in having all his children about him so that at first he was
greatly opposed to the wishes of Paris
But the youth was so persistent and unhappy that the king at last
consented to let him go Without delay Paris called together a few
friends with tastes as adventurous as his own They embarked in a
new ship well provided with all that travellers need and set sail
for the famous land on the shores of the gean Sea of which they
had heard so many wonderful things and which was called Hellas
Nearly in the middle of the plain which forms the southern part of
Hellas was the city of Sparta It was on the river Eurotas and was
the capital of a large district called Lacedmon and it was to this
city that Paris came
Now there was a mysterious reason for this strange desire of
Parishis passionate longing to travel In his early youth while
he was still minding his herds on the rich pastures of Mount Ida
he received a visit from the three greatest goddesses of Olympos
Hera the queen of Heaven and consort of ZeusAthena the goddess
of wisdom and Zeuss favorite daughterand Aphrodite the goddess
of love and beauty had a dispute among themselves
Each thought herself the most beautiful of the three and they would
have come to high words about it had not Athena proposed that they
should ask the handsomest man in the world to settle the question
This happened to be the young royal shepherd Paris So the three
goddesses floated down to the slope of Mount Ida on a snowy cloud
and placed the question before him each promising to reward him
royally if he gave his verdict in her favor
Paris as might have been expected decided in favor of Aphrodite
who had promised him that the fairest woman living in the whole world
should be his wife This promise had to be kept being given by a
goddess but it was the source of endless misfortune for Paris had
a young and lovely wife who was tenderly attached to him while the
fairest of living womenacknowledged as such by fame in all known
countrieswas Queen Helen of Sparta herself the wife of another
man
Her husband was one of the most renowned heroes of Hellas King
Menelaos a son of Atreus and brother of the leader of the Greek chiefs
Agamemnon King of Mycen It was Aphrodite then who inspired Paris
with an insane desire to forsake his parents brothers and wife
It was her secret guidance which led him across the seas and through
the dangers lurking among the hundreds of islands of the Archipelagos
straight to the land of Lacedmon This is the central of the three
peninsulas in which the Peloponnesus ends and might be called the
middle finger of that large hand of which Arcadia is the palm
Paris landed with all his companions on the shores of Lacedmon
where the people received him kindly and helped him on his journey
to Sparta where Menelaos and Helen gave him a cordial welcome
CHAPTER II
THE FLIGHT OF HELEN
Aphrodite while leading Paris to the shores of Lacedmon had not
forgotten her promise and in Sparta itself she was at work at its
fulfilment She inspired Queen Helen with a growing discontent and
restlessness of spirit Menelaos had not noticed any change in her
and it was with an utterly unsuspicious mind that he received the
fatal strangers and made them welcome guests in his land and home
More than that having heard the news from Crete that his presence
there was desirable on account of some urgent business he did not
hesitate to set sail for that island in the expectation of finding
Paris and his companions still enjoying the hospitality of his palace
after a short absence
This was the chance which wily Aphrodite had contrived for Paris
He took the hint and carried Helen away to his ship together with
as much treasure as they could lay hands on and then they sailed
for Troy Little did he heed in his mad desire to call the most
beautiful woman in the world his wife that she was already the wife
of a hero who had received him as an honored guest in his house and
that he was about to destroy the peace and honor of his host
As soon as Menelaos heard of the flight of his wife he hastened back
to Sparta where he found his palace deserted and his treasurehouse
robbed
Then his heart was filled with great wrath He set out at once to
see his brother Agamemnon to consult with him about what was to
be done Agamemnon was ruler over Mycen and highly respected in
all Hellas on account of his power and riches
After the two brothers had talked over this grave affair they
announced to all the leaders in Hellas the great and detestable crime
and asked them for their assistance All the kings chiefs of Hellas
lent a willing ear to this demand for in this breach of hospitality
committed against one of them each felt himself personally aggrieved
and bound to help in the punishment of what in those times was
considered the most unpardonable of all crimes Only one of the kings
held back for awhile and needed much persuasion to join the league
This was Odysseus of Ithaca who could well consider himself at the
time the happiest of mortals for he had lately married Penelope
one of the fairest and most virtuous maidens of Greece He had an
infant son of great beauty and promise and he owned much land and
countless herds of cattle sheep and swine Added to that all the
petty nobles of the island acknowledged him as their chief
But a soothsayer or seer had greatly disturbed him by informing
him that if he went to a great war he would be kept away from his
home for the space of twenty years and even then return to it in
the guise of a beggar after having suffered wrecks captivity
endless wanderings and loss of comrades
No one could doubt that Odysseus was brave but no one could blame
him for wishing to be excused from taking part in the war against
Troy Menelaos and his brother however would accept no excuse from
him as he was the wisest and craftiest of all the leaders and when
Odysseus finally consented to join them he set about arming and
directing the young Greek warriors with all his heart and soul
There was another young prince whom it was absolutely necessary to
secure for a much venerated oracle had given it as a decree of the
gods that Troy could never be taken without his help This was Achilles
son of Peleus king of the Myrmidons in Thessaly and of the beauteous
ocean nymph Thetis Notwithstanding his extreme youth his father
would not disappoint the whole country and he let him go with those
who came for him But he sent along with him his adopted son Patroklos
who was several years older and to whom the boy was passionately
attached and also his oldest and most trusted servant Phoenix These
two the old man and the youth he charged as they hoped for the
mercy of Zeus to keep watchful guard over Achilles whose exceedingly
impetuous and reckless temper exposed him to many dangers which might
be averted by a sensible and loving word spoken in time
Illustration THE SILVERFOOTED THETIS RISING FROM THE WAVES
The Greeks took counsel together and it was resolved that Menelaos
should go in person to Troy and demand back his wife Helen as well
as his treasure and a suitable apology for the wrong done to him and
to all Hellas He chose for his companion the cunning Odysseus On
their arrival in Troy Menelaos and Odysseus presented themselves
before Priam and demanded the return of Helen and the treasures
The king at once called his people together to deliberate upon the
matter and the two Greek kings bravely denounced the mean act of
Paris But the Trojans stirred up by that youth abused the
ambassadors and drove them out of their city
CHAPTER III
THE GREEKS SAIL FOR TROY
The kings and chieftains of Hellas having heard that Odysseus and
Menelaos had been driven out of Troy hastened to call together their
fleets and armies at Aulis a city of Boeotia on a ridge of rock running
out into the sea between two little bays each of which was a harbor
for many ships A hundred thousand men and a thousand ships were
gathered there under the leadership of the celebrated and heroic
chiefs The commanderinchief of the whole army was Agamemnon
Among the renowned leaders were Menelaos the sagacious Odysseus
Ajax and many others Just as they were offering a sacrifice to the
gods in order to start out to the war with their good will a great
miracle happened A fearful snake crept from under the altar and
climbed a tree in which there was a sparrows nest nearly hidden by
the leaves There were eight young sparrows in the nest nine birds
with the mother The snake devoured the fluttering little birds
around which the mother circled as if overcome by grief
Then the snake darted at the motherbird and swallowed it when Zeus
changed the reptile into a stone The Greeks wondered at the sight
but the soothsayer Calchas said to them Why do ye wonder at this
The allpowerful Zeus has sent us this sign because our deeds shall
live forever in the minds of men Just as the snake has devoured the
eight little sparrows and their mother so shall the war swallow up
the nine coming years and in the tenth we shall overcome Troy
The ships of the Greeks lay in the bays of Aulis while the warriors
waited impatiently to set sail But the winds were contrary they
would not blow and the boats waited there year after year for a
sacred hind had been slain by Agamemnon one that belonged to the
goddess Artemis and it was ordered by that goddess that no wind should
arise to take them on toward Troy until her wrath had been appeased
So Agamemnon went to Calchas the seer and asked his advice
whereupon the old prophet told him to send for his lovely young
daughter Iphigeneia and offer her up on the altar as the only
acceptable sacrifice to Artemis When he had placed her upon the altar
and the priest was raising his knife the goddess took pity on
Agamemnon and carried the girl away in a cloud leaving a fine white
doe instead

SACRIFICE IPHIGENEIA
And now arose a favorable wind and the Greeks arrived safely before
Troy How they fought with the Trojans how many of the heroes outlived
the struggle and how many fell in the battle all this we can learn
from an old book called the Iliad We shall select from it only
those things which refer to our hero Odysseus and to complete the
history of that hero we shall go to another book called the Odyssey
Both of these books are the work of the great poet Homer who lived
many years after the war with Troy That we may understand better
what happened later on we must give a short account of the fall of
Troy and of the return of Menelaos and Agamemnon to their own country
CHAPTER IV
THE FALL OF TROY
The war lasted nine years and in the tenth the Greeks conquered Troy
not in battle but by means of a trick which had come into the mind
of Odysseus He told a skilful carpenter to build a wooden horse of
gigantic size and in it he hid the bravest Greek warriors When he
had done this he advised all the other Greeks to depart without leaving
anything behind them and so lead the Trojans to believe that they
had given up the fight and gone home
So the Greeks burned their tents and put off to sea while the Trojans
from their walls watched them with great joy thinking themselves
well rid of an enemy When the last ship had gone the Trojans threw
open the gates of their city and rushed down into the plain where
the Greeks had had their camp to see how the place looked
There they found the wooden horse and one of the Greeks tied to a
tree who told them he was left there as a punishment and that the
wooden horse was an offering to the gods The Trojans made up their
minds to carry it into their city and give it the best place on their
highest hill
Then Laocoon a priest of Apollo stepped forth and said to them
Unhappy people what madness possesses you Do ye think the enemy
gone Do ye know Odysseus so little There are Greek warriors hidden
in this horse or else some other mischief is lurking there Fear
the Greeks even when they bring gifts
With these words he thrust his spear into the flank of the horse
and the arms of the hidden enemy clashed with a loud noise Just then
two snakes of great size sent by Athena rose from the sea and sprang
upon Laocoon and his two sons and coiling around them bit them
to death The Trojans in great fear at the sight took this as a
sign from the gods that the horse was sacred and that they must protect
it and they moved it at once into their city breaking down a part
of their wall to get it in
Having done this they gave themselves up to feasting and making merry
without the slightest thought that any evil was in store for them
But when night had come and all were in a deep sleep the ships of
the Greeks which had been hiding all the while behind a neighboring
island came back The warriors who were concealed in the wooden horse
sprang out and rushing wildly through the city slew the Trojans right
and left without mercy From all sides came wailings and groans and
the flames of the burning city rose up to the sky
A deadly struggle took place between the Trojans and the Greeks Priam
was slain and Paris and many other heroes The victory was to the
Greeks Troy fell never to rise again and the women and children
were led off to become slaves to their conquerors
Thus was destroyed in one night the great and glorious city of Troy
all on account of the crime which Paris had committed against the
laws of hospitality
The trials of the Greeks were not yet at an end After their victory
at Troy they embarked in their ships and started eagerly for their
homes But Zeus prepared a sad fate for them because Ajax had
violently dragged Cassandra the beautiful daughter of Priam from
the altar of Athena and had made her his slave Thus many of the leaders
perished in the sea far from home and some were cast on foreign shores
to die
Menelaos was thrown by wind and waves on the island of Crete and
he lost many of the ships on the cliffs Thence he strayed to the
island of Cyprus noted for its mines and he roved through other
lands until he came to Egypt where he wandered about for eight years
when he returned to Sparta taking Helen with him He became
reconciled to his wife and they lived a quiet life far removed from
the enchantments of the wily Aphrodite
But the saddest fate of all overtook Agamemnon who met his death
in his own house at the hands of his wife and brother
Agamemnon without any accident at sea reached his native land Full
of gratitude he kissed the earth and wept tears of joy at the thought
of meeting his wife and son
He entered his home with a glad heart and his faithless wife came
to meet him but she had prepared a hot bath for him and there he
met his death entangled in a net which she threw over him for she
had not forgotten the loss of her beautiful daughter Iphigeneia
whom she believed to have been offered up as a sacrifice on the altar
of Artemis
She was assisted in this dreadful deed by her husbands brother who
became ruler over the land holding sway eight years when Orestes
the son of Agamemnon slew him and regained the kingdom
And now we come to the return of Odysseus the wisest of the Greeks
who wandered to the remotest part of the earth and learned the customs
of many people and who suffered terrible things by land and sea
PART II
THE RETURN OF ODYSSEUS TO HIS OWN COUNTRY
CHAPTER V
ODYSSEUS ON THE ISLAND OF CALYPSO
All the Greeks who had escaped from the destruction of Troy and had
been spared the terrors of the sea returned to their homes But the
unfortunate Odysseus was delayed by the fair nymph Calypso on her
island where she made her home in a cool and beautiful grotto There
he wept and mourned desiring to see his wife again and his native
land Each of the gods save one Poseidon god of the sea wished
to help him to find the way home Odysseus had brought Poseidons
wrath upon himself through inflicting a terrible injury upon the
favorite son of that deity and for that reason the wrath of the god
fell on him and he was wrecked One day all the other gods had assembled
in the hall of Zeus on Mount Olympos when Athena the favorite
daughter of Zeus and firm friend of Odysseus knowing that her father
in his heart was welldisposed toward the hero began to plead for
him in a way to excite greater pity still
O my father thou great king among the gods she said my heart
is troubled on account of the wise Odysseus who lingers on an island
far away from home and suffers greatly for a nymph lives on the
island the daughter of great Atlas and with sweet words she strives
to make Odysseus forget his native land But he bewails his fate and
is full of sorrow his only wish being to have a glimpse of the smoke
of his beloved country
Zeus thereupon ordered Hermes to depart at once for the island and
tell the nymph to send Odysseus to his home without delay Hermes
obeyed quickly He bound his winged sandals to his feet and taking
his golden wand in his hand flew like a meteor over land and sea
till he reached the island where the nymph Calypso made her abode
He found her within the grotto singing sweetly while she wove a fine
web on a golden loom
All about the grotto there was a grove of cypresstrees in which birds
of gay colors were sporting and springs of pure water bubbling and
the fragrance of strange flowers filled the air When Hermes had gazed
upon these wonders he entered the grotto It was bright with a blazing
fire on a spacious hearth and fragrant with the odor of burning cedar
and cypress
Calypso saw him as he came in and knew him She bade him sit down
on a throne dazzling with jewels and placing a table before him
laden with nectar and ambrosia invited him to eat and drink After
he had finished his repast Hermes told her that Zeus had sent him
to her with the command that she should send Odysseus without delay
to his native land Having given this message he disappeared leaving
Calypso in great grief
Odysseus in the meantime sat by the shore mourning and gazing out
upon the sea Calypso found him there sitting alone weeping and
longing for his home She stood by him and said Odysseus my unhappy
friend do not waste thy life any longer in sorrow The end of thy
grief has come Arise and prepare to depart for thy home Build thee
a raft of the trunks of trees which thou shalt hew down I will put
bread and water and delicate wine on board and I will clothe thee
in comfortable garments and send a favorable wind that thou mayest
safely reach thy native land
Thus spoke the lovely goddess but Odysseus could hardly believe her
and said I fear O goddess that thou hast some other thought in
thy mind and that thou dost not wish to send me home when thou biddest
me sail over this stormy and dangerous sea I shall never go on to
the raft against thy wish and thou must swear the great oath of the
gods that no harm shall come to me
The goddess smiled at these words and taking the hero by the hand
rejoined Thou art a wise man and thy answer is well made I will
pledge thee a solemn oath by the heavens and the earth and the waters
of the Styx that I have no plan of evil against thee And I advise
thee to do as I have instructed thee to be ready for any crisis
Speaking thus the goddess went into the grotto and Odysseus followed
her When he had come into the spacious hall he sat down on his throne
and the nymph brought him rich food and wine Then she took a seat
opposite him and her attendants brought her ambrosia and nectar
which she would gladly have shared with Odysseus that he too might
become an immortal
When the repast was over Calypso narrated to him all the trials he
would have to undergo before he could reach his native land While
she was relating these things the sun sank down and darkness came
upon the island and all who had their abode in the grotto sought
rest and slumber
