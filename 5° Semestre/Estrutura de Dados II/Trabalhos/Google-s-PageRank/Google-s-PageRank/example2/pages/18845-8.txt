Even in thy desert what is like to thee
Thy very weeds are beautiful thy waste
More rich than other climes fertility
Thy wreck a glory and thy ruin graced
With an immaculate charm which can not be defaced
At least four civilizations and probably five have dominated Italy
together they cover a period of more than 3000 yearsPelasgian
Etruscan Greek Roman Italian Of these the Pelasgian is in the main
legendary Next came the Etruscan How old that civilization is no man
knows but its beginnings date from at least 1000 BCthat is earlier
than Homers writings and earlier by nearly three centuries than the
wall built by Romulus around Rome The Etruscan state was a federation
of twelve cities embracing a large part of central and northern
Italyfrom near Naples as far north perhaps as Milan and the great
Lombard plain Etruscans thus dominated the largest and certainly the
fairest parts of Italy Before Rome was founded the Etruscan cities
were populous and opulent commonwealths Together they formed one of the
great naval powers of the Mediterranean Of their civilization we have
abundant knowledge from architectural remains and from thousands of
inscriptions still extant Cortona was one of their oldest towns Ere
Troy itself arose Cortona was
After the Etruscans came Greeks who made flourishing settlements in
southern Italy the chief of which was Paestum founded not later than
600 BC Stupendous ruins survive at Paestum few more interesting ones
have come down to us from the world of ancient Hellas The oldest dates
from about 570 BC Here was once the most fertile and beautiful part
of Italy celebrated for its flowers so that Virgil praised them It is
now a lonely and forsaken land forbidding and malarious Once thickly
populated it has become scarcely more than a haunt of buffalos and
peasants who wander indifferent among these colossal remains of a
vanished race These however are not the civilizations that do most
attract tourists to Italy but the remains found there of ancient Rome
Of that empire all modern men are heirsheirs of her marvelous
political structure of her social and industrial laws
Last of these five civilizations is the Italian the beginnings of which
date from Theodoric the Goth who in the fifth century set up a kingdom
independent of Rome but Gothic rule was of short life and then came
the Lombards who for two hundred years were dominant in northern and
central parts or until Charlemagne grasped their tottering kingdom and
put on their famous Iron Crown In the south Charlemagnes empire never
flourished That part of Italy was for centuries the prey of Saracens
Magyars and Scandinavians From these events emerged modern Italythe
rise of her vigorous republics Pisa Genoa Florence Venice the
dawn meridian splendor and decline of her great schools of sculpture
painting and architecture the power and beauty of which have held the
world in subjection her literature to which also the world has become
a willing captive her splendid municipal spirit a Church whose
influence has circled the globe and in which historians in a spiritual
sense have seen a survival of Imperial Rome But here are tales that
every schoolboy hears
Sicily is reached in a night by steamer from Naples to Palermo or the
tourist may go by train from Naples to Reggio and thence by ferry
across the strait to Messina Its earliest people were contemporaries of
the Etruscans Phoenicians also made settlements there as they did in
many parts of the Mediterranean but these were purely commercial
enterprises Real civilization in Sicily dates from neither of those
races but from Dorian and Ionic Greeks who came perhaps as early as
the founding of Romethat is in the seventh or eighth century BC The
great cities of the Sicilian Greeks were Syracuse Segesta and Girgenti
where still survive colossal remains of their genius In military and
political senses the island for 3000 years has been overrun
plundered and torn asunder by every race known to Mediterranean waters
Beside those already named are Carthaginians under Hannibal Vandals
under Genseric Goths under Theodoric Byzantines under Belisarius
Saracens from Asia Minor Normans under Robert Guiscard German emperors
of the thirteenth century French Angevine princes in whose time came
the Sicilian Vespers Spaniards of the house of Aragon French under
Napoleon Austrians of the nineteenth century and thenthat glorious
day when Garibaldi transferred it to the victorious Sardinian king
The tourist who seeks Greece from northern Europe may go from Trieste by
steamer along the Dalmatian coast in itself a trip of fine surprizes
to Cattaro and Corfu transferring to another steamer for the Pirus
the port of Athens or from Italy by steamer direct from Brindisi the
ancient Brundusium whence sailed all Roman expeditions to the East and
where in retirement once dwelt Cicero No writer has known where to date
the beginnings of civilization in Greece but with Mycen Tiryns and
the Minoan palace of Crete laid bare antiquarians have pointed the way
to dates far older than anything before recorded The palace of Minos
is ancient enough to make the Homeric age seem modern With the Dorian
invasion of Greece about 1000 BC begins that Greek civilization of
which we have so much authentic knowledge Dorian influence was confined
largely to Sparta but it spread to many Greek colonies in the central
Mediterranean and in the Levant It became a powerful influence alike
in art in domestic life and in political supremacy One of its noblest
achievements was its help in keeping out the Persian and another in
supplanting in the Mediterranean the commercial rule of Phoenicians
Attica and Sparta became worldfamous cities with stupendous
achievements in every domain of human art and human efficiency The
colossal debt all Europe and all America owe them is known to everyone
who has ever been to school

ROME
FIRST DAYS IN THE ETERNAL CITY1
BY JOHANN WOLFGANG VON GOETHE
At last I am arrived in this great capital of the world If fifteen
years ago I could have seen it in good company with a wellinformed
guide I should have thought myself very fortunate But as it was to be
that I should thus see it alone and with my own eyes it is well that
this joy has fallen to my lot so late in life
Over the mountains of the Tyrol I have as good as flown Verona
Vicenza Padua and Venice I have carefully looked at hastily glanced
at Ferrara Cento Bologna and scarcely seen Florence at all My
anxiety to reach Rome was so great and it so grew with me every moment
that to think of stopping anywhere was quite out of the question even
in Florence I only stayed three hours Now I am here at my ease and as
it would seem shall be tranquilized for my whole life for we may
almost say that a new life begins when a man once sees with his own eyes
all that before he has but partially heard or read of
All the dreams of my youth I now behold realized before me the subjects
of the first engravings I ever remembered seeing several views of Rome
were hung up in an anteroom of my fathers house stand bodily before my
sight and all that I had long been acquainted with through paintings
or drawings engravings or woodcuts plastercasts and cork models
are here collectively presented to my eye Wherever I go I find some old
acquaintance in this new world it is all just as I had thought it and
yet all is new and just the same might I remark of my own observations
and my own ideas I have not gained any new thoughts but the older ones
have become so defined so vivid and so coherent that they may almost
pass for new ones
I have now been here seven days and by degrees have formed in my mind a
general idea of the city We go diligently backward and forward While I
am thus making myself acquainted with the plan of old and new Rome
viewing the ruins and the buildings visiting this and that villa the
grandest and most remarkable objects are slowly and leisurely
contemplated I do but keep my eyes open and see and then go and come
again for it is only in Rome one can duly prepare oneself for Rome It
must in truth be confessed that it is a sad and melancholy business
to prick and track out ancient Rome in new Rome however it must be
done and we may hope at least for an incalculable gratification We
meet with traces both of majesty and of ruin which alike surpass all
conception what the barbarians spared the builders of new Rome made
havoc of
When one thus beholds an object two thousand years old and more but so
manifoldly and thoroughly altered by the changes of time but sees
nevertheless the same soil the same mountains and often indeed the
same walls and columns one becomes as it were a contemporary of the
great counsels of Fortune and thus it becomes difficult for the
observer to trace from the beginning Rome following Rome and not only
new Rome succeeding to the old but also the several epochs of both old
and new in succession I endeavor first of all to grope my way alone
through the obscurer parts for this is the only plan by which one can
hope fully and completely to perfect by the excellent introductory works
which have been written from the fifteenth century to the present day
The first artists and scholars have occupied their whole lives with
these objects
And this vastness has a strangely tranquilizing effect upon you in Rome
while you pass from place to place in order to visit the most
remarkable objects In other places one has to search for what is
important here one is opprest and borne down with numberless
phenomena Wherever one goes and casts a look around the eye is at once
struck with some landscapeforms of every kind and style palaces and
ruins gardens and statuary distant views of villas cottages and
stables triumphal arches and columns often crowding so close together
that they might all be sketched on a single sheet of paper He ought to
have a hundred hands to write for what can a single pen do here and
besides by the evening one is quite weary and exhausted with the days
seeing and admiring
My strange and perhaps whimsical incognito proves useful to me in many
ways that I never should have thought of As every one thinks himself in
duty bound to ignore who I am and consequently never ventures to speak
to me of myself and my works2 they have no alternative left them but
to speak of themselves or of the matters in which they are most
interested and in this way I become circumstantially informed of the
occupations of each and of everything remarkable that is either taken
in hand or produced Hofrath Reiffenstein goodnaturedly humors this
whim of mine as however for special reasons he could not bear the
name which I had assumed he immediately made a Baron of me and I am
now called the Baron gegen Rondanini uber the Baron who lives
opposite to the Palace Rondanini This designation is sufficiently
precise especially as the Italians are accustomed to speak of people
either by their Christian names or else by some nickname Enough I
have gained my object and I escape the dreadful annoyance of having to
give to everybody an account of myself and my works
In Rome the Rotunda3 both by its exterior and interior has moved me
to offer a willing homage to its magnificence In St Peters I learned
to understand how art no less than nature annihilates the artificial
measures and dimensions of man And in the same way the Apollo Belvidere
also has again drawn me out of reality For as even the most correct
engravings furnish no adequate idea of these buildings so the case is
the same with respect to the marble original of this statue as compared
with the plaster models of it which however I formerly used to look
upon as beautiful
Here I am now living with a calmness and tranquility to which I have for
a long while been a stranger My practise to see and take all things as
they are my fidelity in letting the eye be my light my perfect
renunciation of all pretension have again come to my aid and make me
calmly but most intensely happy Every day has its fresh remarkable
objectevery day its new grand unequaled paintings and a whole which a
man may long think of and dream of but which with all his power of
imagination he can never reach
Yesterday I was at the Pyramid of Cestius and in the evening on the
Palatine on the top of which are the ruins of the palace of the Csars
which stand there like walls of rock Of all this however no idea can
be conveyed In truth there is nothing little here altho indeed
occasionally something to find fault withsomething more or less absurd
in taste and yet even this partakes of the universal grandeur of all
around
Yesterday I visited the nymph Egeria and then the Hippodrome of
Caracalla the ruined tombs along the Via Appia and the tomb of
Metella which is the first to give one a true idea of what solid
masonry really is These men worked for eternityall causes of decay
were calculated except the rage of the spoiler which nothing can
resist The remains of the principal aqueduct are highly venerable How
beautiful and grand a design to supply a whole people with water by so
vast a structure In the evening we came upon the Coliseum when it was
already twilight When one looks at it all else seems little the
edifice is so vast that one can not hold the image of it in ones
soulin memory we think it smaller and then return to it again to find
it every time greater than before
We entered the Sistine Chapel which we found bright and cheerful and
with a good light for the pictures The Last Judgment divided our
admiration with the paintings on the roof by Michael Angelo I could
only see and wonder The mental confidence and boldness of the master
and his grandeur of conception are beyond all expression After we had
looked at all of them over and over again we left this sacred building
and went to St Peters which received from the bright heavens the
loveliest light possible and every part of it was clearly lit up As
men willing to be pleased we were delighted with its vastness and
splendor and did not allow an overnice or hypercritical taste to mar
our pleasure We supprest every harsher judgment we enjoyed the
enjoyable
Lastly we ascended the roof of the church where one finds in little the
plan of a wellbuilt city Houses and magazines springs in appearance
at least churches and a great temple all in the air and beautiful
walks between We mounted the dome and saw glistening before us the
regions of the Apennines Soracte and toward Tivoli the volcanic hills
Frascati Castelgandolfo and the plains and beyond all the sea Close
at our feet lay the whole city of Rome in its length and breadth with
its mountain palaces domes etc Not a breath of air was moving and in
the upper dome it was as they say like being in a hothouse When we
had looked enough at these things we went down and they opened for us
the doors in the cornices of the dome the tympanum and the nave There
is a passage all round and from above you can take a view of the whole
church and of its several parts As we stood on the cornices of the
tympanum we saw beneath us the pope passing to his midday devotions
Nothing therefore was wanting to make our view of St Peters perfect
We at last descended to the piazza and took in a neighboring hotel a
cheerful but frugal meal and then set off for St Cecilias
It would take many words to describe the decorations of this church
which was crammed full of people not a stone of the edifice was to be
seen The pillars were covered with red velvet wound round with gold
lace the capitals were overlaid with embroidered velvet so as to
retain somewhat of the appearance of capitals and all the cornices and
pillars were in like manner covered with hangings All the entablatures
of the walls were also covered with lifelike paintings so that the
whole church seemed to be laid out in mosaic Around the church and on
the high altar more than two hundred wax tapers were burning It looked
like a wall of lights and the whole nave was perfectly lit up The
aisles and side altars were equally adorned and illuminated Right
opposite the high altar and under the organ two scaffolds were
erected which also were covered with velvet on one of which were
placed the singers and on the other the instruments which kept up one
unbroken strain of music
And yet these glorious objects are even still like new acquaintances to
me One has not yet lived with them nor got familiar with their
peculiarities Some of them attract us with irresistible power so that
for a time one feels indifferent if not unjust toward all others
Thus for instance the Pantheon the Apollo Belvedere some colossal
heads and very recently the Sistine Chapel have by turns so won my
whole heart that I scarcely saw any thing besides them But in truth
can man little as man always is and accustomed to littleness ever
make himself equal to all that here surrounds him of the noble the
vast and the refined Even tho he should in any degree adapt himself to
it then how vast is the multitude of objects that immediately press
upon him from all sides and meet him at every turn of which each
demands for itself the tribute of his whole attention How is one to get
out of the difficulty No other way assuredly than by patiently allowing
it to work becoming industrious and attending the while to all that
others have accomplished for our benefit
Of the beauty of a walk through Rome by moonlight it is impossible to
form a conception without having witnessed it All single objects are
swallowed up by the great masses of light and shade and nothing but
grand and general outlines present themselves to the eye For three
several days we have enjoyed to the full the brightest and most glorious
of nights Peculiarly beautiful at such a time is the Coliseum At night
it is always closed a hermit dwells in a little shrine within its
range and beggars of all kinds nestle beneath its crumbling arches the
latter had lit a fire on the arena and a gentle wind bore down the
smoke to the ground so that the lower portion of the ruins was quite
hid by it while above the vast walls stood out in deeper darkness
before the eye As we stopt at the gate to contemplate the scene through
the iron gratings the moon shone brightly in the heavens above
Presently the smoke found its way up the sides and through every chink
and opening while the moon lit it up like a cloud The sight was
exceedingly glorious In such a light one ought also to see the
Pantheon the Capitol the Portico of St Peters and the other grand
streets and squaresand thus sun and moon like the human mind have
quite a different work to do here from elsewhere where the vastest and
yet the most elegant of masses present themselves to their rays
THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE CITY4
BY JOSEPH ADDISON
There are in Rome two sets of antiquities the Christian and the
heathen The former tho of a fresher date are so embroiled with fable
and legend that one receives but little satisfaction from searching
into them The other give a great deal of pleasure to such as have met
with them before in ancient authors for a man who is in Rome can scarce
see an object that does not call to mind a piece of a Latin poet or
historian Among the remains of old Rome the grandeur of the
commonwealth shows itself chiefly in works that were either necessary or
convenient such as temples highways aqueducts walls and bridges of
the city On the contrary the magnificence of Rome under the emperors
is seen principally in such works as were rather for ostentation or
luxury than any real usefulness or necessity as in baths
amphitheaters circuses obelisks triumphal pillars arches and
mausoleums for what they added to the aqueducts was rather to supply
their baths and naumachias and to embellish the city with fountains
than out of any real necessity there was for them
No part of the antiquities of Rome pleased me so much as the ancient
statues of which there is still an incredible variety The workmanship
is often the most exquisite of anything in its kind A man would wonder
how it were possible for so much life to enter into marble as may be
discovered in some of the best of them and even in the meanest one has
the satisfaction of seeing the faces postures airs and dress of those
that have lived so many ages before us There is a strange resemblance
between the figures of the several heathen deities and the descriptions
that the Latin poets have given us of them but as the first may be
looked upon as the ancienter of the two I question not but the Roman
poets were the copiers of the Greek statuaries Tho on other occasions
we often find the statuaries took their subjects from the poets The
Laocoon is too known an instance among many others that are to be met
with at Rome
I could not forbear taking particular notice of the several musical
instruments that are to be seen in the hands of the Apollos muses
fauns satyrs bacchanals and shepherds which might certainly give a
great light to the dispute for preference between the ancient and modern
music It would perhaps be no impertinent design to take off all their
models in wood which might not only give us some notion of the ancient
music but help us to pleasanter instruments than are now in use By the
appearance they make in marble there is not one stringinstrument that
seems comparable to our violins for they are all played on either by
the bare fingers or the plectrum so that they were incapable of adding
any length to their notes or of varying them by those insensible
swellings and wearings away of sound upon the same string which give
so wonderful a sweetness to our modern music Besides that the
stringinstruments must have had very low and feeble voices as may be
guessed from the small proportion of wood about them which could not
contain air enough to render the strokes in any considerable measure
full and sonorous There is a great deal of difference in the make not
only of the several kinds of instruments but even among those of the
same name The syringa for example has sometimes four and sometimes
more pipes as high as the twelve The same variety of strings may be
observed on their harps and of stops on their tibi which shows the
little foundation that such writers have gone upon who from a verse
perhaps in Virgils Eclogues or a short passage in a classic author
have been so very nice in determining the precise shape of the ancient
musical instruments with the exact number of their pipes strings and
stops
Tho the statues that have been found among the ruins of old Rome are
already very numerous there is no question but posterity will have the
pleasure of seeing many noble pieces of sculpture which are still
undiscovered for doubtless there are greater treasures of this nature
under ground than what are yet brought to light5 They have often dug
into lands that are described in old authors as the places where such
particular statues or obelisks stood and have seldom failed of success
in their pursuits There are still many such promising spots of ground
that have never been searched into A great part of the Palatine
mountain for example lies untouched which was formerly the seat of
the imperial palace and may be presumed to abound with more treasures
