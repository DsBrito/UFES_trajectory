TWO YEARS
IN THE
UNITED STATES NAVY
After having passed an examination before the Medical Board of the
United States Navy which was in session at the United States Naval
Asylum Philadelphia Pa Dr James Green President of the Medical
Board I received the following appointment
NAVY DEPARTMENT 22d March 1864
You are hereby appointed Acting Assistant Surgeon in the Navy of
the United States on temporary service
After having executed the enclosed oath and returned it to the
Department with your letter of acceptance you will proceed to
Philadelphia without delay and report to Commodore Stribling for
temporary duty on board the United States steamer Princeton
Very respectfully
GIDEON WELLES Secretary of the Navy
Acting Assistant Surgeon John M Batten United States Navy
Guthrieville Pa
After bidding my relatives and friends goodbye I proceeded to
Philadelphia Pa and reported for duty on board the United States
steamer Princeton which was lying anchored in the Delaware river off
Philadelphia and which was the same vessel on which Abel Parker
Upshur Secretary of State under President Tyler was killed by the
explosion of a monster cannon whilst visiting said vessel in company
with the President and other members of the Cabinet The duty aboard
this vessel was of an initiatory character to prepare officers for
clerical duties peculiar to each of their particular offices I made
the acquaintance on this vessel of Surgeon James McClelland who was
the Surgeon of the Princeton He had entered the United States Navy
when a young man and had been in the service ever since He was about
fiftyfive years of age The first morning after sleeping aboard this
vessel I was awakened by what is always usual aboard a manofwar a
large gun fired at sunrise The concussion and reverberation from the
report of the heavy gun shook the vessel till it creaked and in my
halfslumbering condition I wondered to myself whether it was not a
real battle in which the vessel was engaged but upon mature reflection
and inquiry I learned it was only the report of the sunrise gun
One day whilst on board the Princeton a blank book in which were
copied a number of choice prescriptions used by many of the old
celebrated physicians of Philadelphia fell into my hands The book
belonged to Surgeon James McClelland I thought as I had nothing else
special to do I would occupy the time in recopying these
prescriptions into a blank book of my own and just as I was recopying
the last prescription Dr James McClelland came aboard He noticed me
engaged in writing and came into the stateroom where I was and
observed his book He immediately asked me where I had got the book I
told him where I had got it
Why said he I would not take any money for a copy of those
prescriptions I consider them very valuable and would not for any
consideration let my best friend have a copy of them
I told him that I believed it to be very wrong not to let prescriptions
which have been found valuable in disease be known After reprimanding
me for recopying the prescriptions he cooled down and became very
affable I however got a copy of the prescriptions
Another day in rowing aboard the Princeton from the United States Navy
Yard at Philadelphia Pa I acted as coxswain and came very near
capsizing the boat in the Delaware river The river was very rough and
I got the boat in what the sailors call the trough of the sea I
however arrived on board the Princeton safely after running the boat
bows on against the steamer The officer of the deck said
Sir why dont you bring that boat alongside in a sailorlike manner
Why I said I am glad to get aboard in any manner even though
there were a hole stove in the side of the Princeton by my boat
besides sir I know nothing about bringing a boat alongside in a
sailorlike manner I soon however learned to manage a small boat in
water very well
On receiving the following order
NAVY DEPARTMENT 5th April 1864
SIR You are hereby detached from the Princeton and you will
proceed to Hampton Roads Va without delay and report to Acting
Rear Admiral Lee for duty on board the United States steamer Valley
City
I am very respectfully your obedient servant
GIDEON WELLES Secretary of the Navy
Acting Assistant Surgeon John M Batten US Navy Philadelphia
I left the Princeton and after bidding my mother farewell who was
stopping with my sister who resided in Philadelphiathis was a hard
task and it affected us both greatly but separate we did and whether
we should ever meet again in this world was a question which time alone
would determineon turning a corner I looked back and saw my mother
standing on the steps of the doorway weeping It was to me an
affecting separation I journeyed to the Philadelphia and Baltimore
railroad depot located in the southern part of Philadelphia Pa and
at 8 oclock am of a beautiful day I took the train for Baltimore
Md arriving in that city at about noon of the same day Having some
time to view the city I took advantage of the opportunity and
promenaded the principal thoroughfares At 5 oclock pm I took the
steamer Louisiana for Fortress Monroe and arrived there the next
morning and as soon thereafter as possible reported to Admiral Lee On
the back of my order I find

Reported April 14 1864
Report to Acting Master J A J Brooks Commanding US steamer
Valley City
H K DAVENPORT Commander USN
Senior Naval Officer Sounds of NC
Reported April 15 1864
JOHN A J BROOKS Acting Master
Commanding US steamer Valley City
It being late in the evening of April 8 1864 when I reported on board
the United States steamer Minnesota and there being no opportunity to
return ashore I was compelled to remain aboard the Minnesota till the
following morning April 9 1864 Being very much fatigued I retired
early and soon fell soundly asleep About 1 am I was aroused from
my slumbers by a noise I could not for the life of me tell from whence
it came or whither it had gone but it was sufficient to arouse and
bewilder me for it made the vessel tremble I soon arose from my
sleeping couch put on my clothes and made my way in the darkness
through the wardroom to the forward hatchway and to the gun deck
There I found Admiral Lee with his officers and men on deck in their
night clothes I soon learned what was the cause of the excitement It
was an explosion of a hundredpound torpedo under the bottom of the
Minnesota which had been borne thither by a torpedoboat manned by
Confederates from somewhere up the James river The officers and men on
deck in the gloom of the night were discussing in a subdued but
excited tone the possibility of capturing the torpedoboat but owing
to the fires in the picketboats to the Minnesota being out nothing
could be done till the steam in them was raised and in the meantime
the torpedoboat was allowed to return up the James river The damage
to the Minnesota was considerable though no hole was made in her hull
Her guns were dismounted her partitions were broken down her doors
were jambed her chairs and tables were upset and crockeryware
broken After the excitement of the occasion was over I returned to my
berth and slept soundly till morning
After a few days spent in visiting the important places in the vicinity
of Hampton one of which was Fortress Monroe I took passage on a boat
through the Dismal Swamp Canal to Albemarle Sound and from thence
through the sounds of North Carolina to the Neuse river up which we
steamed to Newbern where I reported to Commander H K Davenport on
board the United States steamer Hetzel who ordered me to report for
duty to Acting Master J A J Brooks aboard the United States Steamer
Valley City which was lying off Hills Point near Washington NC
on the Tar river Dr F E Martindale Surgeon aboard the Valley City
the gentleman whom I was to relieve met me at Newbern NC and
accompanied me to that vessel
It was 5 am of April 15 1864 when I reported to Captain J A J
Brooks for duty I was ushered into the wardroom of the Valley City
and introduced to the officers some of whom were not up James M
Battin the engineer one of the officers who had not yet arisen on
hearing my name mentioned thought that letters directed to him were
being called and he sprang suddenly out of his berth but it was only
to be introduced to a person of the same name yet an entire stranger
Dr Martindale had been expecting his relief for some weeks being
anxious to return home to his family he left for Newbern in the same
boat the Trumpeter which brought us hither from that place
Washington is a small town situated on the left bank of the Tar river
thirty miles from its mouth It was occupied by about fifteen hundred
Federal troops The United States steamer Louisiana the vessel on
which the powder was afterwards exploded off Fort Fisher was lying
immediately off the town Below Washington NC on either side of
the river there was timber On the right bank just below the town
was Rodmans Point three miles farther down the river on the same
side was Hills Point and still farther down on the same side was
Maules Pointplaces which the Confederates had fortified previous to
their falling into the hands of the Federals
Newbern on the Neuse river Washington on the Tar river and Plymouth
on the Roanoke river lie in a circle which might be described from a
point somewhere in Pamlico Soundthe former and latter towns being
each about thirty miles from Washington the latter town being in the
middle so that the report of heavy artillery could be heard at
Washington from either of the other two places
Saturday April 16 1864 my diary states that Plymouth was attacked by
the Confederates Firing continued every day till Tuesday April 19
1864 when the place fell into the hands of the Confederates
LieutenantCommander Charles W Flusser made a remark early in the
morning of April 19 1864 that he would either sink the rebel ram
Albemarle before night or he would be in  Captain Flusser
commanded the United States steamer Miami and Captain French the
illfated Southfield These two vessels had been lashed together at
their sterns early in the morning for the purpose of inducing the
Albemarle to come between the vessels and in this manner if possible
sink her The rebel ram early in the morning of April 19 came
floating down the Roanoke river with the current past the batteries on
the right bank of the river above Plymouth and bore down upon the
United States steamers Southfield and Bombshell and sunk them It is
supposed that Captain Flusser in the excitement of the moment exposed
himself unnecessarily and was shot by a sharpshooter from the
Albemarle When it was noised among the Federal army and naval forces
at Plymouth that Flusser was killed the Federal forces became more or
less demoralized and the place fell into the hands of the
Confederates Captain Flusser was a brave and daring officer He was
interred in the cemetery at Newbern and on a board that marked his
resting place in the fall of 1864 was inscribed his name and below
it Peace to his ashes
On Wednesday April 27 1864 an attack was made by the Confederates on
Washington NC There is great excitement among the residents of the
place so that some of them are leaving by every possible route We
hear the firing quite plain off Hills Point At 12 m all is quiet
Preparation is being made to evacuate Washington NC The day is
beautiful The ammunition of the army at this point has been put aboard
the Valley City for the purpose of conveying it to Newbern The
thermometer stands 85 The Federal large guns on the forts outside of
Washington are being fired all day The Valley City got under weigh
proceeded down the river and shelled the woods below Washington There
were twentythree shells from the 32pounder guns fired which burst
among the treetops
Thursday April 28 1864This morning there were a few shots fired
from heavy guns by the Federal troops but they soon ceased The
evacuation is going on quietly The place has a deserted and gloomy
appearance
Friday April 29The place is quiet Transport boats are steaming to
Newbern laden with the Federal troops and provisions of the place Two
gunboats the United States steamers Commodore Barney and Commodore
Hull steamed up the river to assist in the evacuation At 312
oclock pm the Valley City with thirtyone barrels of powder aboard
and a large number of shells weighed anchor and steamed for Newbern
In going down the Tar river one of those violent thunderstorms
peculiar to that climate came up It was not considered a very safe
place to be aboard the Valley City with all this powder during a
thunderstorm I was glad when the storm was over We got aground for
one hour in Pamlico Sound but arrived safely at Newbern at 9 oclock
am Saturday April 30th 1864 Washington NC is evacuated

proceeded down Tar river past Maules Point down by the mouth of Bath
creek and down by South creek where we anchored at 3 oclock pm
During this cruise there have been eight refugees taken aboard On the
19th we weighed anchor and proceeded to Maules Point On our way we
stopped at the mouth of Durhams creek Captain J A J Brooks and I
went ashore At 6 pm we anchored at the mouth of Bath creek In the
evening there was a heavy thunderstorm accompanied with rain
On the 20th at 912 oclock am we were relieved by the United
States steamer Louisiana and the Valley City was ordered to the
neighborhood of the mouth of Roanoke river in Albemarle Sound to join
the fleet composed of United States steamers Shamrock Sassacus Ceres
Tacony Chicopee Mattabessett and Wyalusing to assist in watching
the Confederate ram Albemarle which was stationed at Plymouth which
is situated on the right bank of the Roanoke river eight miles from
its mouth We arrived at Roanoke Island at 12 m and coaled A portion
of Roanoke Island is a barren sandy place separating the Atlantic
Ocean from Pamlico Sound
On Roanoke Island in 1585 the first attempt to found an English
colony in America was made Though abandoned the following year it was
in advance of any similar effort After the war commenced the place
was held by the Confederates till the year 1862 when the Federal
forces under General Burnside captured the place On the 21st the
Valley City left Roanoke Island at 12 m and joined the fleet and
anchored for the night
On Monday August 22d 1864 at 9 oclock am the Valley City was
ordered to the mouth of Roanoke river where the United States steamers
Ceres and Sassacus were anchored We were to take a very dangerous and
responsible position immediately at the mouth of the Roanoke river
During the long dark nights the Valley City did not anchor for it was
rumored that the Confederate ram Albemarle might come down any night
and especially a very dark night under the cover of the darkness so
that the Valley City must be constantly on the alert If the Albemarle
did make her appearance at the mouth of the Roanoke river the Valley
City was to fire one gun as a signal to the fleet which was anchored
six miles farther down the Albemarle Sound and then steam towards the
fleet
This Confederate ram was a formidable adversary on water She had a
sharp arrowlike ram extending twenty feet under water in front of her
bow She was plated with iron which completely protected her inmates
from solid shot she had two twohundredpounder Brookes rifled guns
on the inside of this iron encasement and one porthole to each of her
four sides She was very unwieldy but in a body of water like the
Albemarle or Pamlico Sound no wooden vessel could cope with her
Friday August 25I visited Edenton today for the first time It is
situated pleasantly on the bank of Edenton Bay as it is called but
really Albemarle Sound The people are kind courteous educated and
hospitable There were magnificent residences in the place each of
which was surrounded by a large yard with shade trees having that
comfortable spacious homelike appearance which so many of the
buildings in Southern cities present When the officers of the Valley
City first visited Edenton they were treated very coolly by the
people but gradually they became quite sociable and we were invited
to visit many of the families of the placein fact one of our
officers afterwards married an Edenton lady Edenton was a sort of
neutral ground at which the Federal officers and Confederate officers
often met On August 31 the day was clear and cool Nothing took place
of any note except a false alarm that the ram was coming down the
river causing some excitement aboard the Valley City
Thursday September 1 1864 the doubleender Shamrock came up from the
fleet Last night some army gunboats took an armed body of men up the
Chowan river to be landed and marched across to Plymouth for the
purpose of destroying the Albemarle The project was not successful
The day is cool and hazy The doubleender Wyalusing came up from the
fleet during the night The Albemarle ram is expected out tonight
2dThe ram did not make her appearance The doubleenders all went to
Edenton The weather is pleasant
On the 4th I went to Edenton and spent the afternoon at Mr Bs and
made the acquaintance of his daughters On the 6th H T Wood
paymasters clerk and myself went aboard a tug and were conveyed to
the United States steamer Shamrock from whence we boarded the
Trumpeter where Dr P H Barton and myself held a medical survey upon
H T Wood and sent him to the United States Naval Hospital at
Norfolk Va I accompanied him We left the Shamrock at 7 oclock pm
in the Trumpeter and anchored at 1 am September 7th and at 6
oclock am weighed anchor and arrived at Roanoke Island at 8 am We
left Roanoke Island at 1 pm and at 8 pm we changed to the Fawn
and after steaming two hours anchored for the night On the 8th we
weighed anchor at 5 am and changed boats to the Undine at 11 am
and arrived at Norfolk at 1 pm when I immediately took H T Wood to
the hospital I stopped at the National Hotel
On the 9th I went to Quartermasters office at Norfolk to procure
transportation to Roanoke Island but I was a half hour too late the
boat Undine having left at 8 oclock am At 5 pm I heard that the
Fawn which had made connection with the Undine in the Dismal Swamp
Canal and the boat I would have been aboard had I not been too late
