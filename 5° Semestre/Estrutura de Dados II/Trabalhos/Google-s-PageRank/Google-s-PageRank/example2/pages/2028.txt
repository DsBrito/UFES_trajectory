THE LADY OF THE CIVET FURS
Henry Leroux wrote busily on The light of the tablelamp softened and
enriched by its mosaic shade gave an appearance of added opulence to
the already handsome appointments of the room The little tableclock
ticked merrily from halfpast eleven to a quarter to twelve
Into the cozy bookish atmosphere of the novelists study penetrated the
muffled chime of Big Ben it chimed the threequarters But with his
mind centered upon his work Leroux wrote on ceaselessly
An odd figure of a man was this popular novelist with patchy and
untidy hair which lessened the otherwise striking contour of his brow
A neglected and unpicturesque figure in a baggy neutralcolored
dressinggown a figure more fitted to a garret than to this spacious
luxurious workroom with the soft light playing upon rank after rank
of rare and costly editions deepening the tones in the Persian carpet
making red morocco more red purifying the vellum and regilding the
gold of the choice bindings caressing lovingly the busts and statuettes
surmounting the bookshelves and twinkling upon the scantilycovered
crown of Henry Leroux The door bell rang
Leroux heedless of external matters pursued his work But the door
bell rang again and continued to ring
Soames Soames Leroux raised his voice irascibly continuing to write
the while Where the devil are you Cant you hear the door bell
Soames did not reveal himself and to the ringing of the bell was added
the unmistakable rattling of a letterbox
Soames Leroux put down his pen and stood up Damn it hes out I
have no memory
He retied the girdle of his dressinggown which had become unfastened
and opened the study door Opposite across the entrance lobby was
the outer door and in the light from the lobby lamp he perceived two
laughing eyes peering in under the upraised flap of the letterbox The
ringing ceased
Are you VERY angry with me for interrupting you cried a girls voice
My dear Miss Cumberly said Leroux without irritation on the
contraryerI am delighted to see youor rather to hear you There is
nobody at home you know
I DO know replied the girl firmly and I know something else also
Father assures me that you simply STARVE yourself when Mrs Leroux is
away So I have brought down an omelette
Omelette muttered Leroux advancing toward the door you
haveerbrought an omelette I understandyes you have brought an
omelette Erthat is very good of you
He hesitated when about to open the outer door raising his hands to his
dishevelled hair and unshaven chin The flap of the letterbox dropped
and the girl outside could be heard stifling her laughter
You must think meervery rude began Leroux I meannot to open
the door But
I quite understand concluded the voice of the unseen one You are a
most untidy object And I shall tell Mira DIRECTLY she returns that she
has no right to leave you alone like this Now I am going to hurry back
upstairs so you may appear safely Dont let the omelette get cold
Good night
No certainly I shall not cried Leroux So good of youIerdo
like omelette Good night
Calmly he returned to his writingtable where in the pursuit of the
elusive character whose exploits he was chronicling and who had brought
him fame and wealth he forgot in the same moment Helen Cumberly and the
omelette
The tableclock ticked merrily on
SCRATCHSCRATCHSPLUTTERSCRATCHwent Henry Lerouxs pen for this
uptodate litterateur essayist by inclination creator of Martin
Zeda Criminal Scientist by popular clamor was yet oldfashioned
enough and sufficient of an enthusiast to pen his work while lesser
men dictated
So amidst that classic company smiling or frowning upon him from the
oaken shelves where Petronius Arbiter exquisite rubbed shoulders
with Balzac plebeian where Omar Khayyam leaned confidentially toward
Philostratus where Mark Twain standing squarely beside Thomas Carlyle
glared across the room at George Meredith Henry Leroux pursued the
amazing career of Martin Zeda
It wanted but five minutes to the hour of midnight when again the door
bell clamored in the silence
Leroux wrote steadily on The bell continued to ring and furthermore
the ringer could be heard beating upon the outer door
Soames cried Leroux irritably Soames Why the hell dont you go to
the door
Leroux stood up dashing his pen upon the table
I shall have to sack that damned man he cried he takes too many
libertiesstopping out until this hour of the night
He pulled open the study door crossed the hallway and opened the door
beyond
In out of the darknessfor the stair lights had been
extinguishedstaggered a woman a woman whose pale face exhibited
despite the ravages of sorrow or illness signs of quite unusual beauty
Her eyes were wide opened and terrorstricken the pupils contracted
almost to vanishing point She wore a magnificent cloak of civet fur
wrapped tightly about her and as Leroux opened the door she tottered
past him into the lobby glancing back over her shoulder
With his upraised hands plunged pathetically into the mop of his hair
Leroux turned and stared at the intruder She groped as if a darkness
had descended clutched at the sides of the study doorway and then
unsteadily enteredand sank down upon the big chesterfield in utter
exhaustion
Leroux rubbing his chin perplexedly walked in after her He
scarcely had his foot upon the study carpet ere the woman started up
tremulously and shot out from the enveloping furs a bare arm and a
pointing quivering finger
Close the door she cried hoarselyclose the door He has
followed me
The disturbed novelist as a man in a dream turned retraced his steps
and closed the outer door of the flat Then rubbing his chin more
vigorously than ever and only desisting from this exercise to fumble in
his dishevelled hair he walked back into the study whose Athenean calm
had thus mysteriously been violated
Two minutes to midnight the most respectable flat in respectable
Westminster a lonely and very abstracted novelistand a palefaced
beautiful woman enveloped in costly furs sitting staring with fearful
eyes straight before her This was such a scene as his sense of the
proprieties and of the probabilities could never have permitted Henry
Leroux to create
His visitor kept moistening her dry lips and swallowing emotionally
Standing at a discreet distance from her
Madam began Leroux nervously
She waved her hand enjoining him to silence and at the same time
intimating that she would explain herself directly speech became
possible Whilst she sought to recover her composure Leroux gradually
forcing himself out of the dreamlike state studied her with a sort of
anxious curiosity
It now became apparent to him that his visitor was no more than
twentyfive or twentysix years of age but illness or trouble or both
together had seared and marred her beauty Amid the auburn masses of
her hair gleamed streaks not of gray but of purest white The low
brow was faintly wrinkled and the bigunnaturally bigeyes were
purple shaded whilst two heavy lines traced their way from the corner
of the nostrils to the corner of the mouthof the drooping mouth with
the bloodless lips
Her pallor became more strange and interesting the longer he studied it
for underlying the skin was a yellow tinge which he found inexplicable
but which he linked in his mind with the contracted pupils of her eyes
seeking vainly for a common cause
He had a hazy impression that his visitor beneath her furs was most
inadequately clothed and seeking confirmation of this his gaze strayed
downward to where one little slippered foot peeped out from the civet
furs
Leroux suppressed a gasp He had caught a glimpse of a bare ankle
He crossed to his writingtable and seated himself glancing sideways
at this living mystery Suddenly she began in a voice tremulous and
scarcely audible
Mr Leroux at a greatat a very great personal risk I have come
tonight What I have to ask of youto entreat of you will will
Two bare arms emerged from the fur and she began clutching at her
throat and bosom as though chokingdying
Leroux leapt up and would have run to her but forcing a ghastly smile
she waved him away again
It is all right she muttered swallowing noisily But frightful
spasms of pain convulsed her contorting her pale face
Some brandy cried Leroux anxiously
If you please whispered the visitor
She dropped her arms and fell back upon the chesterfield insensible
II
MIDNIGHT AND MR KING
Leroux clutched at the corner of the writingtable to steady himself
and stood there looking at the deathly face Under the most favorable
circumstances he was no man of action although in common with the rest
of his kind he prided himself upon the possession of that presence of
mind which he lacked It was a situation which could not have alarmed
Martin Zeda but it alarmed immeasurably nay struck inert with
horror Martin Zedas creator
Then in upon Lerouxs mental turmoil a sensible idea intruded itself
Dr Cumberly he muttered I hope to God he is in
Without touching the recumbent form upon the chesterfield without
seeking to learn without daring to learn if she lived or had died
Leroux the tempo of his life changed to a breathless gallop rushed
out of the study across the entrance hail and throwing wide the flat
door leapt up the stair to the flat abovethat of his old friend Dr
Cumberly
The patter of the slippered feet grew faint upon the stair then as
Leroux reached the landing above became inaudible altogether
In Lerouxs study the tableclock ticked merrily on seeming to hasten
its ticking as the hand crept around closer and closer to midnight
The mosaic shade of the lamp mingled reds and blues and greens upon the
white ceiling above and poured golden light upon the pages of manuscript
strewn about beneath it This was a typical workroom of a literary man
having the ear of the publictypical in every respect save for the
furclad figure outstretched upon the settee
And now the peeping light indiscreetly penetrated to the hem of a silken
garment revealed by some disarrangement of the civet fur To the eye
of an experienced observer had such an observer been present in Henry
Lerouxs study this billow of silk and lace behind the sheltering fur
must have proclaimed itself the edge of a nightrobe just as the ankle
beneath had proclaimed itself to Henry Lerouxs shocked susceptibilities
to be innocent of stocking
Thirty seconds were wanted to complete the cycle of the day when one of
the listless hands thrown across the back of the chesterfield opened and
closed spasmodically The fur at the bosom of the midnight visitor began
rapidly to rise and fall
Then with a choking cry the woman struggled upright her hair hastily
dressed burst free of its bindings and poured in gleaming cascade down
about her shoulders
Clutching with one hand at her cloak in order to keep it wrapped about
her and holding the other blindly before her she rose and with that
same odd groping movement began to approach the writingtable The
pupils of her eyes were mere pinpoints now she shuddered convulsively
and her skin was dewed with perspiration Her breath came in agonized
gasps
GodI am dying and I cannottell him she breathed
Feverishly weakly she took up a pen and upon a quarto page already
half filled with Lerouxs small neat illegible writing began to
scrawl a message bending down one hand upon the table and with her
whole body shaking
Some three or four wavering lines she had written when intimately
for the flat of Henry Leroux in Palace Mansions lay within sight of the
clockfaceBig Ben began to chime midnight
The writer started back and dropped a great blot of ink upon the paper
then realizing the cause of the disturbance forced herself to continue
her task
The chime being completed ONE boomed the clock TWO THREE
FOUR
The light in the entrancehall went out
FIVE boomed Big BenSIX SEVEN
A hand of old ivory hue a long yellow clawish hand with part of a
sinewy forearm crept in from the black lobby through the study doorway
and touched the electric switch
EIGHT
The study was plunged in darkness
Uttering a soba cry of agony and horror that came from her very
soulthe woman stood upright and turned to face toward the door
clutching the sheet of paper in one rigid hand
Through the leaded panes of the window above the writingtable swept
a silvern beam of moonlight It poured searchingly upon the furclad
figure swaying by the table cutting through the darkness of the room
like some huge scimitar to end in a pallid pool about the womans
shadow on the center of the Persian carpet
Coincident with her sobbing cryNINE boomed Big Ben TEN
Two handswith outstretched crooked clutching fingersleapt from the
darkness into the light of the moonbeam
God Oh God came a frenzied rasping shriekMR KING
Straight at the bare throat leapt the yellow hands a gurgling cry
rosefelland died away
Gently noiselessly the lady of the civet fur sank upon the carpet by
the table as she fell a dim black figure bent over her The tearing
of paper told of the note being snatched from her frozen grip but never
for a moment did the face or the form of her assailant encroach upon the
moonbeam
Batlike this second and terrible visitant avoided the light
The deed had occupied so brief a time that but one note of the great
bell had accompanied it
TWELVE rang out the final stroke from the clocktower A low eerie
whistle minor rising in three irregular notes and falling in weird
unusual cadence to silence again came from somewhere outside the room
Then darknessstillnesswith the moon a witness of one more ghastly
crime
Presently confused and intermingled voices from above proclaimed the
return of Leroux with the doctor They were talking in an excited
key the voice of Leroux especially sounding almost hysterical They
created such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Mr John
Exel M P occupant of the flat below who at that very moment had
returned from the House and was about to insert the key in the lock of
his door He looked up the stairway but all being in darkness was
unable to detect anything Therefore he called out
Is that you Leroux Is anything the matter
Matter Exel cried Leroux theres a devil of a business For
mercys sake come up
His curiosity greatly excited Mr Exel mounted the stairs entering
the lobby of Lerouxs flat immediately behind the owner and Dr
Cumberlywho like Leroux was arrayed in a dressinggown for he had
been in bed when summoned by his friend
You are all in the dark here muttered Dr Cumberly fumbling for the
switch
Some one has turned the light out whispered Leroux nervously I
left it on
Dr Cumberly pressed the switch turning up the lobby light as Exel
entered from the landing Then Leroux entering the study first of the
three switched on the light there also
One glance he threw about the room then started back like a man
physically stricken
Cumberly he gasped Cumberlyand he pointed to the furry heap by
the writingtable
You said she lay on the chesterfield muttered Cumberly
I left her there
Dr Cumberly crossed the room and dropped upon his knees He turned the
white face toward the light gently parted the civet fur and pressed
his ear to the silken covering of the breast He started slightly and
looked into the glazing eyes
Replacing the fur which he had disarranged the physician stood up and
fixed a keen gaze upon the face of Henry Leroux The latter swallowed
noisily moistening his parched lips
Is she he muttered is she
Gods mercy Leroux whispered Mr Exelwhat does this mean
The woman is dead said Dr Cumberly
In common with all medical men Dr Cumberly was a physiognomist he was
a great physician and a proportionately great physiognomist Therefore
when he looked into Henry Lerouxs eyes he saw there and recognized
horror and consternation With no further evidence than that furnished
by his own powers of perception he knew that the mystery of this
womans death was as inexplicable to Henry Leroux as it was inexplicable
to himself
He was a masterful man with the gray eyes of a diplomat and he knew
Leroux as did few men He laid both hands upon the novelists shoulders
Brace up old chap he said you will want all your wits about you
I left her began Leroux hesitatinglyI left
We know all about where you left her Leroux interrupted Cumberly
but what we want to get at is this what occurred between the time you
left her and the time of our return
Exel who had walked across to the table and with a horrorstricken
face was gingerly examining the victim now exclaimed
Why Leroux she isshe is UNDRESSED
Leroux clutched at his dishevelled hair with both hands
My dear Exel he criedmy dear good man Why do you use that tone
You say she is undressed as though I were responsible for the poor
souls condition
On the contrary Leroux retorted Exel standing very upright and
staring through his monocle on the contrary YOU misconstrue ME I did
not intend to implyto insinuate
My dear Exel broke in Dr CumberlyLeroux is perfectly well aware
that you intended nothing unkindly But the poor chap quite naturally
is distraught at the moment You MUST understand that man
I understand and I am sorry said Exel casting a sidelong glance
at the body Of course it is a delicate subject No doubt Leroux can
explain
Damn your explanation shrieked Leroux hysterically I CANNOT
explain If I could explain I
Leroux said Cumberly placing his arm paternally about the shaking
manyou are such a nervous subject DO make an effort old fellow
Pull yourself together Exel does not know the circumstances
I am curious to learn them said the M P icily
Leroux was about to launch some angry retort but Cumberly forced him
into the chesterfield and crossing to a bureau poured out a stiff
peg of brandy from a decanter which stood there Leroux sank upon the
chesterfield rubbing his fingers up and down his palms with a
curious nervous movement and glancing at the dead woman and at Exel
alternately in a mechanical regular fashion pathetic to behold
Mr Exel tapping his boot with the head of his inverted cane was
staring fixedly at the doctor
Here you are Leroux said Cumberly drink this up and let us
arrange our facts in decent order before we
Phone for the police concluded Exel his gaze upon the last speaker
Leroux drank the brandy at a gulp and put down the glass upon a little
persian coffee table with a hand which he had somehow contrived to
steady
You are keen on the official forms Exel he said with a wry smile
Please accept my apology for my recenteroutburst but picture this
thing happening in your place
I cannot declared Exel bluntly
You lack imagination said Cumberly Take a whisky and soda and help
me to search the flat
Search the flat
The physician raised a forefinger forensically
Since you Exel if not actually in the building must certainly have
been within sight of the street entrance at the moment of the crime and
since Leroux and I descended the stair and met you on the landing it is
reasonable to suppose that the assassin can only be in one place HERE
HERE cried Exel and Leroux together
Did you see anyone leave the lower hall as you entered
No one emphatically there was no one there
Then I am right
Good God whispered Exel glancing about him with a new and keen
apprehensiveness
Take your drink concluded Cumberly and join me in my search
Thanks replied Exel nervously proffering a cigarcase but I wont
drink
As you wish said the doctor who thus in his masterful way acted
the host and I wont smoke But do you light up
Later muttered Exel later Let us search first
Leroux stood up Cumberly forced him back
Stay where you are Leroux it is elementary strategy to operate from a
fixed base This study shall be the base Ready Exel
Exel nodded and the search commenced Leroux sat rigidly upon the
settee his hands resting upon his knees watching and listening Save
for the merry ticking of the tableclock and the movements of the
searchers from room to room nothing disturbed the silence From the
table and that which lay near to it he kept his gaze obstinately
averted
Five or six minutes passed in this fashion Leroux expecting each to
bring a sudden outcry He was disappointed The searchers returned Exel
noticeably holding himself aloof and Cumberly very stern
Exel a cigar between his teeth walked to the writingtable carefully
circling around the dreadful obstacle which lay in his path to help
himself to a match As he stooped to do so he perceived that in the
closed right hand of the dead woman was a torn scrap of paper
Leroux Cumberly he exclaimed come here
He pointed with the match as Cumberly hurriedly crossed to his side
Leroux inert remained where he sat but watched with haggard eyes Dr
Cumberly bent down and sought to detach the paper from the grip of the
poor cold fingers without tearing it Finally he contrived to release
the fragment and perceiving it to bear some written words he spread
it out beneath the lamp on the table and eagerly scanned it lowering
his massive gray head close to the writing
He inhaled sibilantly
Do you see Exel he jerkedfor Exel was bending over his shoulder
I dobut I dont understand
What is it came hollowly from Leroux
It is the bottom part of an unfinished note said Cumberly slowly
It is written shakily in a womans hand and it readsYour wife
Leroux sprang to his feet and crossed the room in three strides
Wife he muttered His voice seemed to be choked in his throat my
wife It says something about my wife
It says resumed the doctor quietly your wife Then theres a
piece torn out and the two words Mr King No stop follows and the
line is evidently incomplete
My wife mumbled Leroux staring unseeingly at the fragment of paper
MY WIFE MR KING Oh God I shall go mad
Sit down snapped Dr Cumberly turning to him damn it Leroux you
are worse than a woman
In a manner almost childlike the novelist obeyed the will of the
stronger man throwing himself into an armchair and burying his face in
his hands
My wife he kept mutteringmy wife
Exel and the doctor stood staring at one another when suddenly from
outside the flat came a metallic clattering followed by a little
suppressed cry Helen Cumberly in daintiest deshabille appeared in
the lobby carrying in one hand a chafingdish and in the other
the lid As she advanced toward the study from whence she had heard her
fathers voice
Why Mr Leroux she cried I shall CERTAINLY report you to Mira
now You have not even touched the omelette
Good God Cumberly stop her muttered Exel uneasily The door was
not latched
But it was too late Even as the physician turned to intercept his
daughter she crossed the threshold of the study She stopped short
at perceiving Exel then with a womans unerring intuition divined a
tragedy and in the instant of divination sought for and found the
hub of the tragic wheel
One swift glance she cast at the furclad form prostrate
The chafingdish fell from her hand and the omelette rolled a
grotesque mass upon the carpet She swayed dizzily raising one hand
to her brow but had recovered herself even as Leroux sprang forward to
support her
All right Leroux cried Cumberly I will take her upstairs again
Wait for me Exel
Exel nodded lighted his cigar and sat down in a chair remote from the
writingtable
Miramy wife muttered Leroux standing looking after Dr Cumberly
and his daughter as they crossed the lobby She will report tomy
wife
In the outer doorway Helen Cumberly looked back over her shoulder
and her glance met that of Leroux Hers was a healing glance and a
strengthening glance it braced him up as nothing else could have done
He turned to Exel
For Heavens sake Exel he said evenly give me your advicegive
me your help I am going to phone for the police
Exel looked up with an odd expression
I am entirely at your service Leroux he said I can quite
understand how this ghastly affair has shaken you up
It was so sudden said the other plaintively It is incredible
that so much emotion can be crowded into so short a period of a mans
life
Big Ben chimed the quarter after midnight Leroux eyes averted walked
to the writingtable and took up the telephone
III
INSPECTOR DUNBAR TAKES CHARGE
DetectiveInspector Dunbar was admitted by Dr Cumberly He was a man of
notable height largeboned and built gauntly and squarely His clothes
fitted him ill and through them one seemed to perceive the massive
scaffolding of his frame He had gray hair retiring above a high
brow but worn long and untidily at the back a wirelike straightcut
mustache also streaked with gray which served to accentuate the
grimness of his mouth and slightly undershot jaw A massive head with
tawny leonine eyes indeed altogether a leonine face and a frame
indicative of tremendous nervous energy
In the entrance lobby he stood for a moment
My name is Cumberly said the doctor glancing at the card which the
Scotland Yard man had proffered I occupy the flat above
Glad to know you Dr Cumberly replied the detective in a light and
not unpleasant voiceand the fierce eyes momentarily grew kindly
This continued Cumberly drawing Dunbar forward into the study is
my friend LerouxHenry Leroux whose name you will know
I have not that pleasure replied Dunbar
Well added Cumberly he is a famous novelist and his flat
unfortunately has been made the scene of a crime This is
DetectiveInspector Dunbar who has come to solve our difficulties
Leroux He turned to where Exel stood upon the hearthrugtoying with
his monocle Mr John Exel M P
Glad to know you gentlemen said Dunbar
Leroux rose from the armchair in which he had been sitting and stared
drearily at the newcomer Exel screwed the monocle into his right eye
and likewise surveyed the detective Cumberly taking a tumbler from the
bureau said
A scotchandsoda Inspector
It is a suggestion said Dunbar that coming from a medical man
appeals
Whilst the doctor poured out the whisky and squirted the soda into the
glass Inspector Dunbar standing squarely in the middle of the
room fixed his eyes upon the still form lying in the shadow of the
writingtable
You will have been called in doctor he said taking the proffered
tumbler at the time of the crime
Exactly replied Cumberly Mr Leroux ran up to my flat and summoned
me to see the woman
What time would that be
Big Ben had just struck the final stroke of twelve when I came out on
to the landing
Mr Leroux would be waiting there for you
He stood in my entrancelobby whilst I slipped on my dressinggown and
we came down together
I was entering from the street interrupted Exel as they were
descending from above
You can enter from the street sir in a moment said Dunbar holding
up his hand One witness at a time if you please
