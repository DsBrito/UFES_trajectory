closely wrapped in a grey mantle that he could not discern any part of
her countenance She looked over his shoulder on the book and said
with a deep sigh I know that story well and it fares no better with
me than with the princess of whom it tells Froda looked at her with
astonishment Yes yes pursued she with strange becks and nods I
am the descendant of the mighty Rolf to whom the fairest castles and
forests and fields of this island once belonged your castle and your
domains Froda amongst others were his We are now cast down to
poverty and because I am not so fair as Aslauga there is no hope that
my possessions will be restored to me and therefore I am fain to veil
my poor face from every eye It seemed that she shed warm tears beneath
her mantle At this Froda was greatly moved and begged her for
Gods sake to let him know how he could help her for that he was a
descendant of the famous northern heroes of the olden time and perhaps
yet something more than theynamely a good Christian I almost
think murmured she from beneath her covering that you are that very
Froda whom men call the Good and the friend of the Skalds and of whose
generosity and mildness such wonderful stories are told If it be so
there may be help for me You need only give up to me the half of your
fields and meadows and I should be in a condition to live in some
measure such a life as befits the descendant of the mighty Rolf Then
Froda looked thoughtfully on the ground partly because she had asked
for so very much partly also because he was considering whether she
could really be descended from the powerful Rolf But the veiled form
said after a pause I must have been mistaken and you are not indeed
that renowned gentlehearted Froda for how could he have doubted so
long about such a trifle But I will try the utmost means See now for
the sake of the fair Aslauga of whom you have both read and sangfor
the sake of the honoured daughter of Sigurd grant my request Then
Froda started up eagerly and cried Let it be as you have said and
gave her his knightly hand to confirm his words But he could not grasp
the hand of the peasantwoman although her dark form remained close
before him A secret shudder began to run through his limbs whilst
suddenly a light seemed to shine forth from the apparitiona golden
lightin which she became wholly wrapped so that he felt as though
Aslauga stood before him in the flowing veil of her golden hair and
smiling graciously on him Transported and dazzled he sank on his
knees When he rose up once more he only saw a cloudy mist of autumn
spreading over the meadow fringed at its edges with lingering evening
lights and then vanishing far over the waves The knight scarcely knew
what had happened to him He returned to his chamber buried in thought
and sometimes feeling sure that he had beheld Aslauga sometimes again
that some goblin had risen before him with deceitful tricks mocking in
spiteful wise the service which he had vowed to his dead mistress
But henceforth wherever he roved over valley or forest or heath or
whether he sailed upon the waves of the sea the like appearances met
him Once he found a lute lying in a wood and drove a wolf away from
it and when sounds burst from the lute without its being touched a fair
child rose up from it as of old Aslauga herself had done At another
time he would see goats clambering among the highest cliffs by the
seashore and it was a golden form who tended them Then again a
bright queen resplendent in a dazzling bark would seem to glide past
him and salute him graciouslyand if he strove to approach any of
those he found nothing but cloud and mist and vapour Of all this many
a lay might be sung But so much he learnt from them allthat the fair
Lady Aslauga accepted his service and that he was now indeed and in
truth become her knight
Meanwhile the winter had come and gone In northern lands this season
never fails to bring to those who understand and love it many an image
full of beauty and meaning with which a child of man might well be
satisfied so far as earthly happiness can satisfy through all his time
on earth But when the spring came glancing forth with its opening buds
and flowing waters there came also bright and sunny tidings from the
land of Germany to Fuhnen
There stood on the rich banks of the Maine where it pours its waters
through the fertile land of Franconia a castle of almost royal
magnificence whose orphanmistress was a relation of the German
emperor She was named Hildegardis and was acknowledged far and wide
as the fairest of maidens Therefore her imperial uncle wished that she
should wed none but the bravest knight who could anywhere be met with
Accordingly he followed the example of many a noble lord in such a case
and proclaimed a tournament at which the chief prize should be the hand
of the peerless Hildegardis unless the victor already bore in his heart
a lady wedded or betrothed to him for the lists were not to be closed
to any brave warrior of equal birth that the contest of strength and
courage might be so much the richer in competitors
Now the renowned Froda had tidings of this from his German
brethreninarms and he prepared himself to appear at the festival
Before all things he forged for himself a splendid suit of armour as
indeed he was the most excellent armourer of the north farfamed as
it is for skill in that art He worked the helmet out of pure gold and
formed it so that it seemed to be covered with bright flowing locks
which called to mind Aslaugas tresses He also fashioned on the
breastplate of his armour overlaid with silver a golden image in half
relief which represented Aslauga in her veil of flowing locks that he
might make known even at the beginning of the tournamentThis knight
bearing the image of a lady upon his breast fights not for the hand
of the beautiful Hildegardis but only for the joy of battle and for
knightly fame Then he took out of his stables a beautiful Danish
steed embarked it carefully on board a vessel and sailed prosperously
to the opposite shore
CHAPTER II
In one of those fair beechwoods which abound in the fertile land of
Germany he fell in with a young and courteous knight of delicate form
who asked the noble northman to share the meal which he had invitingly
spread out upon the greensward under the shade of the pleasantest
boughs Whilst the two knights sat peacefully together at their repast
they felt drawn towards each other and rejoiced when on rising from it
they observed that they were about to follow the same road They had not
come to this good understanding by means of many words for the young
knight Edwald was of a silent nature and would sit for hours with a
quiet smile upon his lips without opening them to speak But even in
that quiet smile there lay a gentle winning grace and when from time
to time a few simple words of deep meaning sprang to his lips they
seemed like a gift deserving of thanks It was the same with the little
songs which he sang ever and anon they were ended almost as soon as
begun but in each short couplet there dwelt a deep and winning spirit
whether it called forth a kindly sigh or a peaceful smile It seemed
to the noble Froda as if a younger brother rode beside him or even a
tender blooming son They travelled thus many days together and it
appeared as if their path were marked out for them in inseparable union
and much as they rejoiced at this yet they looked sadly at each other
whenever they set out afresh or where crossroads met on finding that
neither took a different direction nay it seemed at times as if a tear
gathered in Edwalds downcast eye
It happened on a time that at their hostelry they met an arrogant
overbearing knight of gigantic stature and powerful frame whose
speech and carriage proved him to be not of German but foreign birth He
appeared to come from the land of Bohemia He cast a contemptuous
smile on Froda who as usual had opened the ancient book of Aslaugas
history and was attentively reading in it You must be a ghostly
knight he said inquiringly and it appeared as if a whole train of
unseemly jests were ready to follow But Froda answered so firmly and
seriously with a negative that the Bohemian stopped short suddenly
as when the beasts after venturing to mock their king the lion are
subdued to quietness by one glance of his eye But not so easily was
the Bohemian knight subdued rather the more did he begin to mock young
Edwald for his delicate form and for his silenceall which he bore for
some time with great patience but when at last the stranger used an
unbecoming phrase he arose girded on his sword and bowing gracefully
he said I thank you Sir Knight that you have given me this
opportunity of proving that I am neither a slothful nor unpractised
knight for only thus can your behaviour be excused which otherwise
must be deemed most unmannerly Are you ready
With these words he moved towards the door the Bohemian knight
followed smiling scornfully while Froda was full of care for his young
and slender companion although his honour was so dear to him that he
could in no way interpose
But it soon appeared how needless were the northmans fears With equal
vigour and address did Edwald assault his gigantic adversary so that to
look upon it was almost like one of those combats between a knight and
some monster of the forest of which ancient legends tell The issue
too was not unlike While the Bohemian was collecting himself for a
decisive stroke Edwald rushed in upon him and with the force of a
wrestler cast him to the ground But he spared his conquered foe
helped him courteously to rise and then turned to mount his own steed
Soon after he and Froda left the hostelry and once more their journey
led them on the same path as before
From henceforth this gives me pleasure said Froda pointing with
satisfaction to their common road I must own to you Edchenhe had
accustomed himself in loving confidence to call his young friend
by that childlike nameI must own to you that hitherto when I have
thought that you might perhaps be journeying with me to the tournament
held in honour of the fair Hildegardis a heaviness came over my heart
Your noble knightly spirit I well knew but I feared lest the strength
of your slender limbs might not be equal to it Now I have learned to
know you as a warrior who may long seek his match and God be praised if
we still hold on in the same path and welcome our earliest meeting in
the lists
But Edwald looked at him sorrowfully and said What can my skill
and strength avail if they be tried against you and for the greatest
earthly prize which one of us alone can win Alas I have long
foreboded with a heavy heart the sad truth that you also are journeying
to the tournament of the fair Hildegardis
Edchen answered Froda with a smile my gentle loving youth see
you not that I already wear on my breastplate the image of a liege lady
I strive but for renown in arms and not for your fair Hildegardis
MY fair Hildegardis answered Edwald with a sigh That she is not
nor ever will beor should she ah Froda it would pierce your heart
I know well the northland faith is deeprooted as your rocks and hard
to dissolve as their summits of snow but let no man think that he can
look unscathed into the eyes of Hildegardis Has not she the haughty
the too haughty maiden so bewitched my tranquil lowly mind that I
forget the gulf which lies between us and still pursue her and would
rather perish than renounce the daring hope to win that eagle spirit for
my own
I will help you to it Edchen answered Froda smiling still Would
that I knew how this allconquering lady looks She must resemble the
Valkyrien of our heathen forefathers since so many mighty warriors are
overcome by her
Edwald solemnly drew forth a picture from beneath his breastplate and
held it before him Fixed and as if enchanted Froda gazed upon it
with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyes the smile passed away from his
countenance as the sunlight fades away from the meadows before the
coming darkness of the storm
See you not now my noble comrade whispered Edwald that for one of
us two or perhaps for both the joy of life is gone
Not yet replied Froda with a powerful effort but hide your magic
picture and let us rest beneath this shade You must be somewhat spent
with your late encounter and a strange weariness oppresses me with
leaden weight They dismounted from their steeds and stretched
themselves upon the ground
The noble Froda had no thought of sleep but he wished to be undisturbed
whilst he wrestled strongly with himself and strove if it might be to
drive from his mind that image of fearful beauty It seemed as if this
new influence had already become a part of his very life and at last
a restless dreamy sleep did indeed overshadow the exhausted warrior He
fancied himself engaged in combat with many knights whilst Hildegardis
looked on smiling from a richlyadorned balcony and just as he thought
he had gained the victory the bleeding Edwald lay groaning beneath his
horses feet Then again it seemed as if Hildegardis stood by his side
in a church and they were about to receive the marriageblessing He
knew well that this was not right and the yes which he was to utter
he pressed back with resolute effort into his heart and forthwith
his eyes were moistened with burning tears From yet stranger and more
bewildering visions the voice of Edwald at last awoke him He raised
himself up and heard his young companion saying courteously as he
looked towards a neighbouring thicket Only return noble maiden I
will surely help you if I can and I had no wish to scare you away but
that the slumbers of my brother in arms might not be disturbed by you
A golden gleam shone through the branches as it vanished
For heavens sake my faithful comrade cried Froda to whom are you
speaking and who has been here by me
I cannot myself rightly understand said Edwald Hardly had you
dropped asleep when a figure came forth from the forest closely wrapped
in a dark mantle At first I took her for a peasant She seated herself
at your head and though I could see nothing of her countenance I could
well observe that she was sorely troubled and even shedding tears I
made signs to her to depart lest she should disturb your sleep and
would have offered her a piece of gold supposing that poverty must
be the cause of her deep distress But my hand seemed powerless and
a shudder passed through me as if I had entertained such a purpose
towards a queen Immediately glittering locks of gold waved here and
there between the folds of her closewrapped mantle and the thicket
began almost to shine in the light which they shed Poor youth said
she then you love truly and can well understand how a lofty womans
heart burns in keenest sorrow when a noble knight who vowed himself to
be her own withdraws his heart and like a weak bondman is led away
to meaner hopes Hereupon she arose and sighing disappeared in
yonder thicket It almost seemed to me Froda as though she uttered
your name
Yes it was me she named answered Froda and not in vain she named
me Aslauga thy knight comes and enters the lists and all for thee
and thy reward alone At the same time my Edchen we will win for you
your haughty bride With this he sprang upon his steed full of the
proud joy of former times and when the magic of Hildegardis beauty
dazzling and bewildering would rise up before him he said smiling
Aslauga and the sun of his inner life shone forth again cloudless and
serene
CHAPTER III
From a balcony of her castle on the Maine Hildegardis was wont to
refresh herself in the cool of the evening by gazing on the rich
landscape below but gazing more eagerly on the glitter of arms
which often came in sight from many a distant road for knights were
approaching singly or with a train of followers all eager to prove
their courage and their strength in striving for the high prize of the
tournament She was in truth a proud and highminded maidenperhaps
more so than became even her dazzling beauty and her princely rank As
she now gazed with a proud smile on the glittering roads a damsel of her
train began the following lay
The joyous song of birds in spring
Upon the wing
Doth echo far through wood and dell
And freely tell
Their treasures sweet of love and mirth
Too gladsome for this lowly earth
The gentle breath of flowers in May
Oer meadows gay
Doth fill the pure and balmy air
With perfume rare
Still floating round each slender form
Though scorched by sun or torn by storm
But every high and glorious aim
And the pure flame
That deep abiding in my heart
Can neer depart
Too lofty for my faltring tongue
Must die with me unknown unsung
Wherefore do you sing that song and at this moment said Hildegardis
striving to appear scornful and proud though a deep and secret sadness
was plainly enough seen to overshadow her countenance It came into my
head unawares replied the damsel as I looked upon the road by which
the gentle Edwald with his pleasant lays first approached us for it was
from him I learnt it But seems it not to you my gracious lady and to
you too my companions as if Edwald himself were again riding that way
towards the castle Dreamer said Hildegardis scornfullyand yet
could not for some space withdraw her eyes from the knight till at
length with an effort she turned them on Froda who rode beside him
saying Yes truly that knight is Edwald but what can you find
to notice in the meekspirited silent boy Here fix your eyes my
maidens on this majestic figure if you would behold a knight indeed
She was silent A voice within her as though of prophecy said Now
the victor of the tournament rides into the courtyard and she who
had never feared the presence of any human being now felt humbled and
almost painfully awed when she beheld the northern knight
At the evening meal the two newlyarrived knights were placed opposite
to the royal Hildegardis As Froda after the northern fashion remained
in full armour the golden image of Aslauga gleamed from his silver
breastplate full before the eyes of the haughty lady She smiled
scornfully as if conscious that it depended on her will to drive that
image from the breast and from the heart of the strangerknight
Then suddenly a clear golden light passed through the hall so that
Hildegardis said O the keen lightning and covered her eyes with
both her hands But Froda looked into the dazzling radiance with a
joyful gaze of welcome At this Hildegardis feared him yet more though
at the same time she thought This loftiest and most mysterious of men
must be born for me alone Yet could she not forbear almost against
her will to look from time to time in friendly tenderness on the poor
Edwald who sat there silent and with a sweet smile seemed to pity and
to mock his own suffering and his own vain hopes
When the two knights were alone in their sleepingchamber Edwald looked
for a long time in silence into the dewy balmy night Then he sang to
his lute
A hero wise and brave
A lowly tender youth
Are wandering through the land
In steadfast love and truth
The hero by his deeds
Both bliss and fame had won
And still with heartfelt joy
The faithful child looked on
But Froda took the lute from his hands and said No Edchen I will
teach you another song listen
Theres a gleam in the hall and like mornings light
Hath shone upon all her presence bright
Suitors watch as she passes by
She may gladden their hearts by one glance of her eye
But coldly she gazeth upon the throng
And they that have sought her may seek her long
She turns her away from the richly clad knight
She heeds not the words of the learned wight
The prince is before her in all his pride
But other the visions around her that glide
Then tell me in all the wide worlds space
Who may eer win that ladys grace
In sorrowful love there sits apart
The gentle squire who hath her heart
They all are deceived by fancies vain
And he knows it not who the prize shall gain
Edwald thrilled As God wills said he softly to himself But I
cannot understand how such a thing could be As God wills repeated
Froda The two friends embraced each other and soon after fell into a
peaceful slumber
Some days afterwards Froda sat in a secluded bower of the castle garden
and was reading in the ancient book of his lovely mistress Aslauga It
happened at that very time that Hildegardis passed by She stood still
and said thoughtfully Strange union that you are of knight and sage
how comes it that you bring forth so little out of the deep treasures of
your knowledge And yet I think you must have many a choice history at
your command even such as that which now lies open before you for I
see rich and bright pictures of knights and ladies painted amongst the
letters
It is indeed the most surpassing and enchanting history in all the
world said Froda but you have neither patience nor thoughtfulness to
listen to our wonderful legends of the north
Why think you so answered Hildegardis with that pride which she
rejoiced to display towards Froda when she could find courage to do so
and placing herself on a stone seat opposite she commanded him at once
to read something to her out of that fair book
Froda began and in the very effort which he made to change the old
heroic speech of Iceland into the German tongue his heart and mind were
stirred more fervently and solemnly As he looked up from time to time
he beheld the countenance of Hildegardis beaming in evergrowing beauty
with joy wonder and interest and the thought passed through his mind
whether this could indeed be his destined bride to whom Aslauga herself
was guiding him
Then suddenly the characters became strangely confused it seemed as
if the pictures began to move so that he was obliged to stop While he
fixed his eyes with a strong effort upon the book endeavouring to drive
away this strange confusion he heard a wellknown sweetly solemn voice
which said Leave a little space for me fair lady The history which
that knight is reading to you relates to me and I hear it gladly
Before the eyes of Froda as he raised them from his book sat Aslauga
in all the glory of her flowing golden locks beside Hildegardis on
the seat With tears of affright in her eyes the maiden sank back and
fainted Solemnly yet graciously Aslauga warned her knight with a
motion of her fair right hand and vanished
What have I done to you said Hildegardis when recovered from her
swoon by his care what have I done to you evilminded knight that
you call up your northern spectres before me and wellnigh destroy me
through terror of your magic arts Lady answered Froda may God help
me as I have not called hither the wondrous lady who but now appeared
to us But now her will is known to me and I commend you to Gods
keeping
With that he walked thoughtfully out of the bower Hildegardis fled in
terror from the gloomy shade and rushing out on the opposite side
reached a fair open grassplot where Edwald in the soft glow of
twilight was gathering flowers and meeting her with a courteous
smile offered her a nosegay of narcissus and pansies
CHAPTER IV
At length the day fixed for the tournament arrived and a distinguished
noble appointed by the German emperor arranged all things in the most
magnificent and sumptuous guise for the solemn festival The field of
combat opened wide and fair and level thickly strewn with the finest
sand so that both man and horse might find sure footing and like a
pure field of snow it shone forth from the midst of the flowery plain
Rich hangings of silk from Arabia curiously embroidered with Indian
gold adorned with their various colours the lists enclosing the space
and hung from the lofty galleries which had been erected for the ladies
and the nobles who were to behold the combat At the upper end under a
canopy of majestic arches richly wrought in gold was the place of the
Lady Hildegardis Green wreaths and garlands waved gracefully between
the glittering pillars in the soft breezes of July And with impatient
eyes the multitude who crowded beyond the lists gazed upwards
expecting the appearance of the fairest maiden of Germany and were
only at times drawn to another part by the stately approach of the
combatants Oh how many a bright suit of armour many a silken
richlyembroidered mantle how many a lofty waving plume was here to be
seen The splendid troop of knights moved within the lists greeting and
conversing with each other as a bed of flowers stirred by a breath
of wind but the flowerstems had grown to lofty trees the yellow and
white flowerleaves had changed to gold and silver and the dewdrops to
pearls and diamonds For whatever was most fair and costly most varied
and full of meaning had these noble knights collected in honour of
this day Many an eye was turned on Froda who without scarf plume
or mantle with his shining silver breastplate on which appeared the
golden image of Aslauga and with his wellwrought helmet of golden
locks shone in the midst of the crowd like polished brass Others
again there were who took pleasure in looking at the young Edwald his
whole armour was covered by a mantle of white silk embroidered in azure
and silver as his whole helmet was concealed by a waving plume of white
feathers He was arrayed with almost feminine elegance and yet the
conscious power with which he controlled his fiery snowwhite steed
made known the victorious strength and manliness of the warlike
stripling
In strange contrast appeared the tall and almost gigantic figure of
a knight clothed in a mantle of black glossy bearskin bordered with
costly fur but without any ornament of shining metal His very helmet
was covered with dark bearskin and instead of plumes a mass of
bloodred horsehair hung like a flowing mane profusely on every side
Well did Froda and Edwald remember that dark knight for he was the
uncourteous guest of the hostelry He also seemed to remark the two
knights for he turned his unruly steed suddenly round forced his
way through the crowd of warriors and after he had spoken over the
enclosure to a hideous bronzecoloured woman sprang with a wild leap
across the lists and with the speed of an arrow vanished out of
sight The old woman looked after him with a friendly nod The assembled
people laughed as at a strange masquing device but Edwald and Froda
had their own almost shuddering thoughts concerning it which however
neither imparted to the other
The kettledrums rolled the trumpets sounded and led by the aged duke
Hildegardis advanced richly apparelled but more dazzling through the
brightness of her own beauty She stepped forward beneath the arches of
the golden bower and bowed to the assembly The knights bent low and
the feeling rushed into many a heart There is no man on earth who can
deserve a bride so queenly When Froda bowed his head it seemed to him
as if the golden radiance of Aslaugaa tresses floated before his sight
and his spirit rose in joy and pride that his lady held him worthy to be
so often reminded of her
And now the tournament began At first the knights strove with blunted
swords and battleaxes then they ran their course with lances man to
man but at last they divided into two equal parties and a general
assault began in which every one was allowed to use at his own
will either sword or lance Froda and Edwald equally surpassed their
antagonists as measuring each his own strength and that of his friend
they had foreseen And now it must be decided by a single combat with
lances to whom the highest prize of victory should belong Before this
trial began they rode slowly together into the middle of the course
and consulted where each should take his place Keep you your
guidingstar still before your sight said Froda with a smile the
like gracious help will not be wanting to me Edwald looked round
astonished for the lady of whom his friend seemed to speak but Froda
went on I have done wrong in hiding aught from you but after the
tournament you shall know all Now lay aside all needless thoughts of
wonder dear Edchen and sit firm in your saddle for I warn you that
I shall run this course with all my might Not my honour alone is at
stake but the far higher honour of my lady
So also do I purpose to demean myself said Edwald with a friendly
smile They shook each other by the hand and rode to their places
Amidst the sound of trumpets they met again running their course with
lightning speed the lances shivered with a crash the horses staggered
the knights firm in their saddles pulled them up and rode back to
their places But as they prepared for another course Edwalds white
steed snorted in wild affright and Frodas powerful chestnut reared up
foaming
It was plain that the two noble animals shrunk from a second hard
encounter but their riders held them fast with spur and bit and
firm and obedient they again dashed forward at the second call of
the trumpet Edwald who by one deep ardent gaze on the beauty of his
mistress had stamped it afresh on his soul cried aloud at the moment
of encounter Hildegardis and so mightily did his lance strike
his valiant adversary that Froda sank backwards on his steed with
difficulty keeping his seat in his saddle or holding firm in his
stirrups whilst Edwald flew by unshaken lowered his spear to salute
Hildegardis as he passed her bower and then amidst the loud applause
of the multitude rushed to his place ready for the third course And
ah Hildegardis herself overcome by surprise had greeted him with a
blush and a look of kindness it seemed to him as if the overwhelming
joy of victory were already gained But it was not so for the valiant
Froda burning with noble shame had again tamed his affrighted
steed and chastising him sharply with the spur for his share in
this mischance said in a low voice Beautiful and beloved lady show
thyself to methe honour of thy name is at stake To every other eye
it seemed as if a golden rosytinted summers cloud was passing over the
deepblue sky but Froda beheld the heavenly countenance of his lady
felt the waving of her golden tresses and cried Aslauga The two
rushed together and Edwald was hurled from his saddle far upon the
dusty plain
Froda remained for a time motionless according to the laws of chivalry
as though waiting to see whether any one would dispute his victory
and appearing on his mailed steed like some lofty statue of brass All
around stood the multitude in silent wonderment When at length they
burst forth into shouts of triumph he beckoned earnestly with his hand
and all were again silent He then sprang lightly from his saddle and
hastened to the spot where the fallen Edwald was striving to rise He
pressed him closely to his breast led his snowwhite steed towards
him and would not be denied holding the stirrups of the youth whilst
he mounted Then he bestrode his own steed and rode by Edwalds side
towards the golden bower of Hildegardis where with lowered spear and
open vizor he thus spoke Fairest of all living ladies I bring you
