accomplished a shining success Mary gave him a brandnew Barlow
knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that
swept his system shook him to his foundations True the knife would
not cut anything but it was a sureenough Barlow and there was
inconceivable grandeur in thatthough where the Western boys ever got
the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its
injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps Tom
contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin
on the bureau when he was called off to dress for Sundayschool
Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went
outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he
dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves
poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the
kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the
door But Mary removed the towel and said
Now aint you ashamed Tom You mustnt be so bad Water wont hurt
you
Tom was a trifle disconcerted The basin was refilled and this time
he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big
breath and began When he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes
shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony
of suds and water was dripping from his face But when he emerged from
the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped
short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line
there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in
front and backward around his neck Mary took him in hand and when she
was done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction of
color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls
wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect He privately
smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his
hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and
his own filled his life with bitterness Then Mary got out a suit of
his clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two yearsthey
were simply called his other clothesand so by that we know the
size of his wardrobe The girl put him to rights after he had dressed
himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his
vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned
him with his speckled straw hat He now looked exceedingly improved and
uncomfortable He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there
was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him He
hoped that Mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she
coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them
out He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do
everything he didnt want to do But Mary said persuasively
Please Tomthats a good boy
So he got into the shoes snarling Mary was soon ready and the three
children set out for Sundayschoola place that Tom hated with his
whole heart but Sid and Mary were fond of it
Sabbathschool hours were from nine to halfpast ten and then church
service Two of the children always remained for the sermon
voluntarily and the other always remained toofor stronger reasons
The churchs highbacked uncushioned pews would seat about three
hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort
of pine board treebox on top of it for a steeple At the door Tom
dropped back a step and accosted a Sundaydressed comrade
Say Billy got a yaller ticket
Yes
Whatll you take for her
Whatll you give
Piece of lickrish and a fishhook
Less see em
Tom exhibited They were satisfactory and the property changed hands
Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and
some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones He waylaid other
boys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or
fifteen minutes longer He entered the church now with a swarm of
clean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started a
quarrel with the first boy that came handy The teacher a grave
elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a
boys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy
turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear
him say Ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher Toms whole
class were of a patternrestless noisy and troublesome When they
came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses
perfectly but had to be prompted all along However they worried
through and each got his rewardin small blue tickets each with a
passage of Scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of
the recitation Ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be
exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow
tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible worth forty
cents in those easy times to the pupil How many of my readers would
have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even
for a Dore Bible And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this wayit
was the patient work of two yearsand a boy of German parentage had
won four or five He once recited three thousand verses without
stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and
he was little better than an idiot from that day fortha grievous
misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the
superintendent as Tom expressed it had always made this boy come out
and spread himself Only the older pupils managed to keep their
tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible and
so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy
circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for
that day that on the spot every scholars heart was fired with a fresh
ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks It is possible that Toms
mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but
unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory
and the eclat that came with it
In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with
a closed hymnbook in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its
leaves and commanded attention When a Sundayschool superintendent
makes his customary little speech a hymnbook in the hand is as
necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer
who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert
though why is a mystery for neither the hymnbook nor the sheet of
music is ever referred to by the sufferer This superintendent was a
slim creature of thirtyfive with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair
he wore a stiff standingcollar whose upper edge almost reached his
ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his
moutha fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning
of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped
on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a banknote
and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the
fashion of the day like sleighrunnersan effect patiently and
laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes
pressed against a wall for hours together Mr Walters was very earnest
of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred
things and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly
matters that unconsciously to himself his Sundayschool voice had
acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on weekdays He
began after this fashion
Now children I want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty
as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two There
that is it That is the way good little boys and girls should do I see
one little girl who is looking out of the windowI am afraid she
thinks I am out there somewhereperhaps up in one of the trees making
a speech to the little birds Applausive titter I want to tell you
how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces
assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good And
so forth and so on It is not necessary to set down the rest of the
oration It was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar
to us all
The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights
and other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetings
and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases
of isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary But now every
sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of Mr Walters voice and
the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent
gratitude
A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which
was more or less rarethe entrance of visitors lawyer Thatcher
accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middleaged
gentleman with irongray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless
the latters wife The lady was leading a child Tom had been restless
and full of chafings and repinings consciencesmitten toohe could
not meet Amy Lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze But
when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in
a moment The next moment he was showing off with all his might
cuffing boys pulling hair making facesin a word using every art
that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause His
exaltation had but one alloythe memory of his humiliation in this
angels gardenand that record in sand was fast washing out under
the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now
The visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as Mr
Walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school The
middleaged man turned out to be a prodigious personageno less a one
than the county judgealtogether the most august creation these
children had ever looked uponand they wondered what kind of material
he was made ofand they half wanted to hear him roar and were half
afraid he might too He was from Constantinople twelve miles awayso
he had travelled and seen the worldthese very eyes had looked upon
the county courthousewhich was said to have a tin roof The awe
which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence
and the ranks of staring eyes This was the great Judge Thatcher
brother of their own lawyer Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward to
be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school It would
have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings
Look at him Jim Hes a going up there Saylook hes a going to
shake hands with himhe IS shaking hands with him By jings dont you
wish you was Jeff
Mr Walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official
bustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgments
discharging directions here there everywhere that he could find a
target The librarian showed offrunning hither and thither with his
arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that
insect authority delights in The young lady teachers showed off
bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed lifting
pretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good ones
lovingly The young gentlemen teachers showed off with small
scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to
disciplineand most of the teachers of both sexes found business up
at the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently had
to be done over again two or three times with much seeming vexation
The little girls showed off in various ways and the little boys
showed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads
and the murmur of scufflings And above it all the great man sat and
beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himself
in the sun of his own grandeurfor he was showing off too
There was only one thing wanting to make Mr Walters ecstasy
complete and that was a chance to deliver a Bibleprize and exhibit a
prodigy Several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough
he had been around among the star pupils inquiring He would have given
worlds now to have that German lad back again with a sound mind
And now at this moment when hope was dead Tom Sawyer came forward
with nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and
demanded a Bible This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky Walters
was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten
years But there was no getting around ithere were the certified
checks and they were good for their face Tom was therefore elevated
to a place with the Judge and the other elect and the great news was
announced from headquarters It was the most stunning surprise of the
decade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero
up to the judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels to
gaze upon in place of one The boys were all eaten up with envybut
those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too
late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by
trading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in selling
whitewashing privileges These despised themselves as being the dupes
of a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass
The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as the
superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked
somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught him
that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light
perhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two
thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premisesa dozen would
strain his capacity without a doubt
Amy Lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make Tom see it in
her facebut he wouldnt look She wondered then she was just a grain
troubled next a dim suspicion came and wentcame again she watched
a furtive glance told her worldsand then her heart broke and she was
jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody Tom
most of all she thought
Tom was introduced to the Judge but his tongue was tied his breath
would hardly come his heart quakedpartly because of the awful
greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent He would
have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark The
Judge put his hand on Toms head and called him a fine little man and
asked him what his name was The boy stammered gasped and got it out
Tom
Oh no not Tomit is
Thomas
Ah thats it I thought there was more to it maybe Thats very
well But youve another one I daresay and youll tell it to me wont
you
Tell the gentleman your other name Thomas said Walters and say
sir You mustnt forget your manners
Thomas Sawyersir
Thats it Thats a good boy Fine boy Fine manly little fellow
Two thousand verses is a great manyvery very great many And you
never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for
knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world its what
makes great men and good men youll be a great man and a good man
yourself some day Thomas and then youll look back and say Its all
owing to the precious Sundayschool privileges of my boyhoodits all
owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learnits all owing to
the good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and
gave me a beautiful Biblea splendid elegant Bibleto keep and have
it all for my own alwaysits all owing to right bringing up That is
what you will say Thomasand you wouldnt take any money for those
two thousand versesno indeed you wouldnt And now you wouldnt mind
telling me and this lady some of the things youve learnedno I know
you wouldntfor we are proud of little boys that learn Now no
doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples Wont you tell us
the names of the first two that were appointed
Tom was tugging at a buttonhole and looking sheepish He blushed
now and his eyes fell Mr Walters heart sank within him He said to
himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest
questionwhy DID the Judge ask him Yet he felt obliged to speak up
and say
Answer the gentleman Thomasdont be afraid
Tom still hung fire
Now I know youll tell me said the lady The names of the first
two disciples were
DAVID AND GOLIAH
Let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene
CHAPTER V
ABOUT halfpast ten the cracked bell of the small church began to
ring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon
The Sundayschool children distributed themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision Aunt
Polly came and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with herTom being placed
next the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open
window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible The crowd
filed up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better
days the mayor and his wifefor they had a mayor there among other
unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow Douglass fair
smart and forty a generous goodhearted soul and welltodo her
hill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and
much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St Petersburg
could boast the bent and venerable Major and Mrs Ward lawyer
Riverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of the
village followed by a troop of lawnclad and ribbondecked young
heartbreakers then all the young clerks in town in a bodyfor they
had stood in the vestibule sucking their caneheads a circling wall of
oiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet
and last of all came the Model Boy Willie Mufferson taking as heedful
care of his mother as if she were cut glass He always brought his
mother to church and was the pride of all the matrons The boys all
hated him he was so good And besides he had been thrown up to them
so much His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as
usual on Sundaysaccidentally Tom had no handkerchief and he looked
upon boys who had as snobs
The congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more
to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the
church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the
choir in the gallery The choir always tittered and whispered all
through service There was once a church choir that was not illbred
but I have forgotten where it was now It was a great many years ago
and I can scarcely remember anything about it but I think it was in
some foreign country
The minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in
a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country
His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached
a certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost
word and then plunged down as if from a springboard
Shall I be carried toe the skies on flowry BEDS of ease
Whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro BLOODY seas
He was regarded as a wonderful reader At church sociables he was
always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies
would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps
and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say Words
cannot express it it is too beautiful TOO beautiful for this mortal
earth
After the hymn had been sung the Rev Mr Sprague turned himself into
a bulletinboard and read off notices of meetings and societies and
things till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of
dooma queer custom which is still kept up in America even in cities
away here in this age of abundant newspapers Often the less there is
to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it
And now the minister prayed A good generous prayer it was and went
into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the
church for the other churches of the village for the village itself
for the county for the State for the State officers for the United
States for the churches of the United States for Congress for the
President for the officers of the Government for poor sailors tossed
by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of
European monarchies and Oriental despotisms for such as have the light
and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear
withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with
a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace
and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a
grateful harvest of good Amen
There was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat
down The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer
he only endured itif he even did that much He was restive all
through it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously
for he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and the
clergymans regular route over itand when a little trifle of new
matter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole nature
resented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly In the
midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of
him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together
embracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously that
it seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender thread
of a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legs
and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coattails going
through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly
safe As indeed it was for as sorely as Toms hands itched to grab for
it they did not darehe believed his soul would be instantly destroyed
if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on But with the
closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and the
instant the Amen was out the fly was a prisoner of war His aunt
detected the act and made him let it go
The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through
an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod
and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone
and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be
hardly worth the saving Tom counted the pages of the sermon after
church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew
anything else about the discourse However this time he was really
interested for a little while The minister made a grand and moving
picture of the assembling together of the worlds hosts at the
millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a
little child should lead them But the pathos the lesson the moral of
the great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of the
conspicuousness of the principal character before the onlooking
nations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that he
wished he could be that child if it was a tame lion
Now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed
Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out It was
a large black beetle with formidable jawsa pinchbug he called it
It was in a percussioncap box The first thing the beetle did was to
take him by the finger A natural fillip followed the beetle went
floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger
went into the boys mouth The beetle lay there working its helpless
legs unable to turn over Tom eyed it and longed for it but it was
safe out of his reach Other people uninterested in the sermon found
relief in the beetle and they eyed it too Presently a vagrant poodle
dog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and
the quiet weary of captivity sighing for change He spied the beetle
the drooping tail lifted and wagged He surveyed the prize walked
around it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again
grew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a
gingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and another
began to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle
between his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at last
and then indifferent and absentminded His head nodded and little by
little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it There
was a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell a
couple of yards away and lit on its back once more The neighboring
spectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind
fans and handkerchiefs and Tom was entirely happy The dog looked
foolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart
too and a craving for revenge So he went to the beetle and began a
wary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circle
lighting with his forepaws within an inch of the creature making even
closer snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till his
ears flapped again But he grew tired once more after a while tried
to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an ant
around with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of that
yawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it Then
there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the
aisle the yelps continued and so did the dog he crossed the house in
front of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before the
doors he clamored up the homestretch his anguish grew with his
progress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit
with the gleam and the speed of light At last the frantic sufferer
sheered from its course and sprang into its masters lap he flung it
out of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and
died in the distance
By this time the whole church was redfaced and suffocating with
suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill The
discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all
possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest
sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of
unholy mirth under cover of some remote pewback as if the poor
parson had said a rarely facetious thing It was a genuine relief to
the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction
pronounced
Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there
was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of
variety in it He had but one marring thought he was willing that the
dog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright
in him to carry it off
CHAPTER VI
MONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable Monday morning always found
him sobecause it began another weeks slow suffering in school He
generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening
holiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much
more odious
Tom lay thinking Presently it occurred to him that he wished he was
sick then he could stay home from school Here was a vague
possibility He canvassed his system No ailment was found and he
investigated again This time he thought he could detect colicky
symptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope But
they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away He reflected
further Suddenly he discovered something One of his upper front teeth
was loose This was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a
starter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he came
into court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and that
would hurt So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the
present and seek further Nothing offered for some little time and
then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that
laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him
lose a finger So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the
sheet and held it up for inspection But now he did not know the
necessary symptoms However it seemed well worth while to chance it
so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit
But Sid slept on unconscious
Tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe
No result from Sid
Tom was panting with his exertions by this time He took a rest and
then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans
Sid snored on
Tom was aggravated He said Sid Sid and shook him This course
worked well and Tom began to groan again Sid yawned stretched then
brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at
Tom Tom went on groaning Sid said
Tom Say Tom No response Here Tom TOM What is the matter
Tom And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously
Tom moaned out
Oh dont Sid Dont joggle me
Why whats the matter Tom I must call auntie
Nonever mind Itll be over by and by maybe Dont call anybody
But I must DONT groan so Tom its awful How long you been this
way
Hours Ouch Oh dont stir so Sid youll kill me
Tom why didnt you wake me sooner Oh Tom DONT It makes my
flesh crawl to hear you Tom what is the matter
I forgive you everything Sid Groan Everything youve ever done
to me When Im gone
Oh Tom you aint dying are you Dont Tomoh dont Maybe
I forgive everybody Sid Groan Tell em so Sid And Sid you
give my windowsash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thats
come to town and tell her
But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone Tom was suffering in
reality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his
groans had gathered quite a genuine tone
Sid flew downstairs and said
Oh Aunt Polly come Toms dying
Dying
Yesm Dont waitcome quick
Rubbage I dont believe it
But she fled upstairs nevertheless with Sid and Mary at her heels
And her face grew white too and her lip trembled When she reached
the bedside she gasped out
You Tom Tom whats the matter with you
Oh auntie Im
Whats the matter with youwhat is the matter with you child
Oh auntie my sore toes mortified
The old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a
little then did both together This restored her and she said
Tom what a turn you did give me Now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this
The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe The boy felt a
little foolish and he said
Aunt Polly it SEEMED mortified and it hurt so I never minded my
tooth at all
Your tooth indeed Whats the matter with your tooth
One of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful
