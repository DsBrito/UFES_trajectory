For an instant he stood looking inquiringly at the general Then he
realized what Stuart had said and the blue eyes sparkled This was
the thing he had almost given up hoping foran independent command
and a chance to operate in the enemys rear
In 1855 John Singleton Mosby newly graduated from the University of
Virginia had opened a law office at Bristol Washington County
Virginia and a year later he had married
The son of a welltodo farmer and slaveowner his boyhood had been
devoted to outdoor sports especially hunting and he was accounted an
expert horseman and a dead shot even in a society in which skill with
guns and horses was taken for granted Otherwise the outbreak of the
war had found him without military qualifications and completely
uninterested in military matters Moreover he had been a rabid
antisecessionist
It must be remembered however that like most Southerners he
regarded secession as an entirely local issue to be settled by the
people of each state for themselves He took no exception to the
position that a state had the constitutional right to sever its
connection with the Union if its people so desired His objection to
secession was based upon what he considered to be political logic He
realized that once begun secession was a process which could only
end in reducing America to a cluster of impotent petty sovereignties
torn by hostilities incapable of any concerted action a fair prey to
any outside aggressor
However he was also a believer in the paramount sovereignty of the
states He was first of all a Virginian So when Virginia voted in
favor of secession Mosby while he deplored the choice felt that he
had no alternative but to accept it He promptly enlisted in a locally
organized cavalry company the Washington Mounted Rifles under a
former U S officer and West Point graduate William E Jones
His letters to his wife told of his early military experienceshis
pleasure at receiving one of the fine new Sharps carbines which
Captain Jones had wangled for his company and later a Colt 44
revolver his first taste of fire in the Shenandoah Valley where the
company now incorporated into Colonel Stuarts First Virginia
Cavalry were covering Johnstons march to reenforce Beauregard his
rather passive participation in the big battle at Manassas He was
keenly disappointed at being held in reserve throughout the fighting
Long afterward it was to be his expressed opinion that the
Confederacy had lost the war by failing to follow the initial victory
and exploit the rout of McDowells army
The remainder of 1861 saw him doing picket duty in Fairfax County
When Stuart was promoted to brigadier general and Captain Jones took
his place as colonel of the First Virginia Mosby became the latters
adjutant There should have been a commission along with this post
but this seems to have been snarled in red tape at Richmond and never
came through It was about this time that Mosby first came to Stuarts
personal attention Mosby spent a night at headquarters after
escorting a couple of young ladies who had been living outside the
Confederate lines and were anxious to reach relatives living farther
south
Stuart had been quite favorably impressed with Mosby and when some
time later the latter lost his place as adjutant of the First by
reason of Jones promotion to brigadier general and Fitzhugh Lees
taking over the regiment Mosby became one of Stuarts headquarters
scouts
Scouting for Jeb Stuart was not the easiest work in the world nor the
safest but Mosby appears to have enjoyed it and certainly made good
at it It was he who scouted the route for Stuarts celebrated Ride
Around MacClellan in June 1862 an exploit which brought his name to
the favorable attention of General Lee By this time still without
commission he was accepted at Stuarts headquarters as a sort of
courtesy officer and generally addressed as Captain Mosby Stuart
made several efforts to get him commissioned but War Department red
tape seems to have blocked all of them By this time too Mosby had
become convinced of the utter worthlessness of the saber as a
cavalrymans weapon and for his own armament adopted a pair of Colts
The revolver of the Civil War was of course a percussioncap weapon
Even with the powder and bullet contained in a combustible paper
cartridge loading such an arm was a slow process each bullet had to
be forced in the front of the chamber on top of its propellant charge
by means of a hinged rammer under the barrel and a tiny copper cap
had to be placed on each nipple It was nothing to attempt on a
prancing horse The Union cavalryman was armed with a singleshot
carbinethe sevenshot Spencer repeater was not to make its
battlefield appearance until late in 1863and one revolver giving
him a total of seven shots without reloading With a pair of
sixshooters Mosby had a fiveshot advantage over any opponent he was
likely to encounter As he saw it tactical strength lay in the number
of shots which could be delivered without reloading rather than in
the number of men firing them Once he reached a position of
independent command he was to adhere consistently to this principle
On July 14 1862 General John Pope who had taken over a newly
created Union Army made up of the commands of McDowell Banks and
Fremont issued a bombastic and tactless order to his new command
making invidious comparisons between the armies in the west and those
in the east He said I hear constantly of taking strong positions
and holding them of lines of retreat and of bases of supplies
Let us discard all such ideas Let us study the probable lines of
retreat of our opponents and leave our own to take care of
themselves
That intrigued Mosby If General Pope wasnt going to take care of his
own rear somebody ought to do it for him and who better than John
Mosby He went promptly to Stuart pointing out Popes disinterest in
his own lines of supply and communication and asked that he be given
about twenty men and detailed to get into Popes rear and see what
sort of disturbance he could create
Stuart doubted the propriety of sending men into what was then
Stonewall Jacksons territory but he gave Mosby a letter to Jackson
recommending the bearer highly and outlining what he proposed doing
with the request that he be given some men to try it With this
letter Mosby set out for Jacksons headquarters
He never reached his destination On the way he was taken prisoner by
a raiding force of New York cavalry and arrived instead at Old
Capitol jail in Washington Stuart requested his exchange at once and
Mosby spent only about ten days in Old Capitol and then was sent down
the Potomac on an exchange boat along with a number of other
prisoners of war for Hampton Roads
The boatload of prisoners about to be exchanged and returned to
their own army were allowed to pass through a busy port of military
embarkation and debarkation with every opportunity to observe
everything that was going on and to make a bad matter worse the
steamboat captain was himself a Confederate sympathizer So when
Mosby from the exchange boat observed a number of transports lying
at anchor he had no trouble at all in learning that they carried
Burnsides men newly brought north from the Carolinas With the help
of the steamboat captain Mosby was able to learn that the transports
were bound for Acquia Creek on the Potomac that meant that the
reenforcements were for Pope
As soon as he was exchanged Mosby made all haste for Lees
headquarters to report what he had discovered Lee remembering Mosby
as the man who had scouted ahead of Stuarts Ride Around MacClellan
knew that he had a hot bit of information from a credible source A
dispatch rider was started off at once for Jackson and Jackson struck
Pope at Cedar Mountain before he could be reenforced Mosby returned
to Stuarts headquarters losing no time in promoting a pair of 44s
to replace the ones lost when captured and found his stock with
Stuart at an alltime high as a result of his recent feat of espionage
while in the hands of the enemy
So he was with Stuart when Stuart stopped at Laura Ratcliffes home
and was on hand when Stuart wanted to make one of his characteristic
gestures of gallantry And so he finally got his independent
commandall of six menand orders to operate in the enemys rear
Whatever Stuart might have had in mind in leaving him behind to look
after the loyal Confederate people John Mosby had no intention of
posting himself in Laura Ratcliffes front yard as a guard of honor
He had a theory of guerrilla warfare which he wanted to test In part
it derived from his experiences in the Shenandoah Valley and in
Fairfax County but in larger part it was based upon his own
understanding of the fundamental nature of war
The majority of guerrilla leaders have always been severely tactical
in their thinking That is to say they have been concerned almost
exclusively with immediate results A troop column is ambushed a
picket post attacked or a supply dump destroyed for the sake of the
immediate loss of personnel or materiel so inflicted upon the enemy
Mosby however had a wellconceived strategic theory He knew in
view of the magnitude of the war that the tactical effects of his
operations would simply be lost in the overall picture But if he
could create enough uproar in the Union rear he believed that he
could force the withdrawal from the front of a regiment or even a
brigade to guard against his attacks and in some future battle the
absence of that regiment or brigade might tip the scale of battle or
at least make some future Confederate victory more complete or some
defeat less crushing
As soon as Stuarts column started southward Mosby took his six men
across Bull Run Mountain to Middleburg where he ordered them to
scatter out billet themselves at outlying farms and meet him at the
Middleburg hotel on the night of January 10 Meanwhile he returned
alone to Fairfax County spending the next week making contacts with
the people and gathering information
On the night of Saturday January 10 he took his men through the gap
at Aldie and into Fairfax County His first stop was at a farmhouse
near Herndon Station where he had friends and there he met a
woodsman trapper and market hunter named John Underwood who with
his two brothers had been carrying on a private resistance movement
against the Union occupation ever since the Confederate Army had moved
out of the region Overjoyed at the presence of regular Confederate
troops even as few as a halfdozen Underwood offered to guide Mosby
to a nearby Union picket post
Capturing this post was no particularly spectacular feat of arms
Mosbys party dismounted about 200 yards away from it and crept up on
it to find seven members of the Fifth New York squatting around a
fire smoking drinking coffee and trying to keep warm Their first
intimation of the presence of any enemy nearer than the Rappahannock
River came when Mosby and his men sprang to their feet leveled
revolvers and demanded their surrender One cavalryman made a grab for
his carbine and Mosby shot him the others put up their hands The
wounded man was given first aid wrapped in a blanket and placed
beside the fire to wait until the post would be relieved The others
were mounted on their own horses and taken to Middleburg where they
were paroled ie released after they gave their word not to take up
arms again against the Confederacy This not entirely satisfactory
handling of prisoners was the only means left open to Mosby with his
small force behind enemy lines
The next night Mosby stayed out of Fairfax County to allow the
excitement to die down a little but the night after he and his men
accompanied by Underwood raided a post where the Little River
Turnpike crossed Cub Run Then after picking up a twoman road patrol
en route they raided another post near Fryingpan Church This time
they brought back fourteen prisoners and horses
In all he and his sextet had captured nineteen prisoners and twenty
horses But Mosby still wasnt satisfied What he wanted was a few
more men and orders to operate behind the Union army on a permanent
basis So after paroling the catch of the night before he told John
Underwood to get busy gathering information and establishing contacts
and he took his six men back to Culpepper reporting his activities to
Stuart and claiming that under his existing orders he had not felt
justified in staying away from the army longer At the same time he
asked for a larger detail and orders to continue operating in northern
Virginia
In doing so he knew he was taking a chance that Stuart would keep him
at Culpepper but as both armies had gone into winter quarters after
Fredericksburg with only a minimum of outpost activity he reasoned
that Stuart would be willing to send him back As it happened Stuart
was so delighted with the success of Mosbys brief activity that he
gave him fifteen men all from the First Virginia Cavalry and orders
to operate until recalled On January 18 Mosby was back at
Middleburg ready to go to work in earnest
As before he scattered his men over the countryside quartering them
on the people This time before scattering them he told them to meet
him at Zion Church just beyond the gap at Aldie on the night of the
28th During the intervening ten days he was not only busy gathering
information but also in an intensive recruiting campaign among the
people of upper Fauquier and lower Loudoun Counties
In this last his best sellingpoint was a recent act of the
Confederate States Congress called the Scott Partisan Ranger Law This
piece of legislation was in effect an extension of the principles of
prize law and privateering to land warfare It authorized the
formation of independent cavalry companies to be considered part of
the armed forces of the Confederacy their members to serve without
pay and mount themselves in return for which they were to be entitled
to keep any spoil of war captured from the enemy The terms enemy
and spoil of war were defined so liberally as to cover almost
anything not the property of the government or citizens of the
Confederacy There were provisions also entitling partisan companies
to draw on the Confederate government for arms and ammunition and
permitting them to turn in and receive payment for any spoil which
they did not wish to keep for themselves
The law had met with considerable opposition from the Confederate
military authorities who claimed that it would attract men and horses
away from the regular service and into ineffective freebooting There
is no doubt that a number of independent companies organized under the
Scott Law accomplished nothing of military value Some degenerated
into mere bandit gangs full of deserters from both sides and
terrible only to the unfortunate Confederate citizens living within
their range of operations On the other hand as Mosby was to
demonstrate a properly employed partisan company could be of
considerable use
It was the provision about booty however which appealed to Mosby As
he intended operating in the Union rear where the richest plunder
could be found he hoped that the prospect would attract numerous
recruits The countryside contained many men capable of bearing arms
who had remained at home to look after their farms but who would be
more than willing to ride with him now and then in hope of securing a
new horse for farm work or some needed harness or food and blankets
for their families The regular Mosby Men called them the
Conglomerates and Mosby himself once said that they resembled the
Democrat party being held together only by the cohesive power of
public plunder
Mosbys first operation with his new force was in the pattern of the
other twothe stealthy dismounted approach and sudden surprise of an
isolated picket post He brought back eleven prisoners and twelve
horses and sets of small arms and as on the night of the 10th left
one wounded enemy behind As on the previous occasions the prisoners
were taken as far as Middleburg before being released on parole
For this reason Mosby was sure that Colonel Sir Percy Wyndham
commander of the brigade which included the Fifth New York Eighteenth
Pennsylvania and the First Vermont would assume that this village was
the raiders headquarters Colonel Wyndham a Europeantrained
soldier would scarcely conceive of any military force however small
without a regular headquarters and a fixed camp Therefore Wyndham
would come looking for him at Middleburg So with a companion named
Fountain Beattie Mosby put up for what remained of the night at the
home of a Mr Lorman Chancellor on the road from Aldie a few miles
east of Middleburg The rest of the company were ordered to stay
outside Middleburg
Mosbys estimate of his opponent was uncannily accurate The next
morning about daybreak he and Beattie were wakened by one of the
Chancellor servants and warned that a large body of Union cavalry was
approaching up the road from Aldie Peering through the window
shutters they watched about 200 men of the Fifth New York ride by
with Colonel Wyndham himself in the lead As soon as they were out of
sight up the road Mosby and Beattie who had hastily dressed dashed
downstairs for their horses
Im going to keep an eye on these people Mosby told Beattie
Gather up as many men as you can and meet me in about half an hour
on the hill above Middleburg But hurry Id rather have five men now
than a hundred by noon
When Beattie with six men rejoined Mosby he found the latter sitting
on a stump munching an apple and watching the enemy through his field
glasses Wyndham who had been searching Middleburg for Mosbys
headquarters was just forming his men for a push on to Upperville
where he had been assured by the canny Middleburgers that Mosby had
his camp
Mosby and his men cantered down the hillside to the road as Wyndhams
force moved out of the village and then broke into a mad gallop to
overtake them
It was always hard to be sure whether jackets were dirty gray or faded
blue As the Union soldier had a not unfounded belief that the
Virginia woods were swarming with bushwhackers Confederate
guerillas the haste of a few men left behind to rejoin the column
was quite understandable The rearguard pulled up and waited for them
Then at about twenty yards range one of the New Yorkers a
sergeant realized what was happening and shouted a warning
Theyre Rebs
Instantly one of Mosbys men Ned Hurst shot him dead Other
revolvers ready drawn banged and several Union cavalrymen were
wounded Mosby and his followers hastily snatched the bridles of three
others disarmed them and turned galloping away with them
By this time the main column which had not halted with the
rearguard was four or five hundred yards away There was a brief
uproar a shouting of contradictory orders and then the whole column
turned and came back at a gallop Mosby four of his men and the
three prisoners got away but Beattie and two others were captured
when their horses fell on a sheet of ice treacherously hidden under
the snow There was no possibility of rescuing them After the capture
of Beattie and his companions the pursuit stopped Halting at a
distance Mosby saw Wyndham form his force into a compact body and
move off toward Aldie at a brisk trot He sent off the prisoners under
guard of two of his men and followed Wyndhams retreat almost to Aldie
without opportunity to inflict any more damage
During his stop at Middleburg Wyndham had heaped coals on a growing
opposition to Mosby fostered by proUnionists in the neighborhood
Wyndham informed the townspeople that he would burn the town and
imprison the citizens if Mosby continued the attacks on his outposts
A group of citizens taking the threat to heart petitioned Stuart to
recall Mosby but the general sent a stinging rebuke telling the
Middleburgers that Mosby and his men were risking their lives which
were worth considerably more than a few houses and barns
Mosby was also worried about the antipathy to the Scott Law and the
partisan ranger system which was growing among some of the general
officers of the Confederacy To counteract such opposition he needed
to achieve some spectacular feat of arms which would capture the
popular imagination make a public hero of himself and place him
above criticism
And all the while his force was growing The booty from his raids
excited the cupidity of the more venturesome farmers and they were
exchanging the hoe for the revolver and joining him A number of the
convalescents and furloughed soldiers were arranging transfers to his
command Others with no permanent military attachment were drifting
to Middleburg Upperville or Rectortown inquiring where they might
find Mosby and making their way to join him
There was a young Irishman Dick Moran There was a Fauquier County
blacksmith Billy Hibbs who reported armed with a huge broadsword
which had been the last product of his forge There were Walter
Frankland Joe Nelson Frank Williams and George Whitescarver among
the first to join on a permanent basis And one day there was the
strangest recruit of all
A meeting was held on the 25th of February at the Blackwell farm near
Upperville and Mosby and most of his men were in the kitchen of the
farmhouse going over a map of the section they intended raiding when
a couple of men who had been on guard outside entered pushing a Union
cavalry sergeant ahead of them
This Yankee says he wants to see you Captain one of the men
announced He came on foot says his horse broke a leg and had to be
shot
Well Im Mosby the guerrilla leader said What do you want
The man in blue came to attention and saluted
Ive come here to join your company sir he said calmly
There was an excited outburst from the men in the kitchen but Mosby
took the announcement in stride
And whats your name and unit sergeant
James F Ames late Fifth New York Cavalry sir
After further conversation Mosby decided that the big Yankee was
sincere in his avowed decision to join the forces of the Confederacy
He had some doubts about his alleged motives the man was animated
with a most vindictive hatred of the Union government all his former
officers and most of his former comrades No one ever learned what
injury real or fancied had driven Sergeant Ames to desertion and
treason but in a few minutes Mosby was sure that the man was through
with the Union Army
Everybody else was equally sure that he was a spy probably sent over
by Wyndham to assassinate Mosby Eventually Mosby proposed a test of
Ames sincerity The deserter should guide the company to a Union
picket post and should accompany the raiders unarmed Mosby would
ride behind him ready to shoot him at the first sign of treachery
The others agreed to judge the new recruit by his conduct on the raid
A fairly strong post at a schoolhouse at Thompsons Corners was
selected as the objective and they set out sixteen men beside Ames
and Mosby through a storm of rain and sleet Stopping at a nearby
farm Mosby learned that the post had been heavily reenforced since
he had last raided it There were now about a hundred men at the
schoolhouse
Pleased at this evidence that his campaign to force the enemy to
increase his guard was bearing fruit Mosby decided to abandon his
customary tactics of dismounting at a distance and approaching on
foot On a night like this the enemy would not be expecting him so
the raiders advanced boldly along the road Mosby telling Ames to make
whatever answer he thought would be believed in case they were
challenged However a couple of triggerhappy vedettes let off their
carbines at them yelled The Rebs are coming and galloped for the
schoolhouse
There was nothing to do but gallop after them and Mosby and his band
came pelting in on the heels of the vedettes Hitherto his raids had
been more or less bloodless but this time he had a fight on his
hands and if the men in the schoolhouse had stayed inside and
defended themselves with carbine fire they would have driven off the
attack Instead however they rushed outside each man trying to
mount his horse A lieutenant and seven men were killed about twice
that number wounded and five prisoners were taken The rest
believing themselves attacked by about twice their own strength
scattered into the woods and got away
Ames who had ridden unarmed flung himself upon a Union cavalryman at
the first collision and disarmed him then threw himself into the
fight with the captured saber His conduct during the brief battle at
the schoolhouse was such as to remove from everybodys mind the
suspicion that his conversion to the Confederate cause was anything
but genuine Thereafter he was accepted as a Mosby man
He was accepted by Mosby himself as a veritable godsend since he was
acquainted with the location of every Union force in Fairfax County
and knew of a corridor by which it would be possible to penetrate
Wyndhams entire system of cavalry posts as far as Fairfax Courthouse
itself Here then was the making of the spectacular coup which Mosby
needed to answer his critics and enemies both at Middleburg and at
army headquarters He decided to attempt nothing less than a raid upon
Fairfax Courthouse with the capture of Wyndham as its purpose
This last would entail something of a sacrifice for he had come to
esteem Sir Percy highly as an opponent whose mind was an open book and
whose every move could be predicted in advance With Wyndham
eliminated he would have to go to the trouble of learning the mental
processes of his successor
However Wyndham would be the ideal captive to grace a Mosby triumph
and a successful raid on Fairfax Courthouse garrisoned as it was by
between five and ten thousand Union troops would not only secure
Mosbys position in his own army but would start just the sort of a
panic which would result in demands that the Union rear be reenforced
at the expense of the front
So on Sunday March 8 Mosby led thirtynine men through the gap at
Aldie the largest force that had followed him to date It was the
sort of a foul night that he liked for raiding with a drizzling rain
falling upon melting snow It was pitch dark before they found the
road between Centreville and Fairfax along which a telegraph line had
been strung to connect the main cavalry camp with General Stoughtons
headquarters Mosby sent one of his men Harry Hatcher up a pole to
cut the wire They cut another telegraph line at Fairfax Station and
left the road moving through the woods toward Fairfax Courthouse At
this time only Mosby and Yank Ames knew the purpose of the
expedition
It was therefore with surprise and some consternation that the others
realized where they were as they rode into the courthouse square and
halted A buzz of excited whispers rose from the men
Thats right Mosby assured them calmly Were in Fairfax
Courthouse right in the middle of ten thousand Yankees but dont let
that worry you All but about a dozen of them are asleep Now if you
all keep your heads and do what youre told well be as safe as
though we were in Jeff Davis front parlor
He then began giving instructions detailing parties to round up
horses and capture any soldiers they found awake and moving about He
went himself with several men to the home of a citizen named
Murray where he had been told that Wyndham had quartered himself but
here he received the disappointing news that the Englishman had gone
to Washington that afternoon
A few minutes later however Joe Nelson came up with a prisoner an
infantryman who had just been relieved from sentry duty at General
Stoughtons headquarters who said that there had been a party there
earlier in the evening and that Stoughton and several other officers
were still there Mosby still disappointed at his failure to secure
Wyndham decided to accept Stoughton in his place Taking several men
he went at once to the house where the prisoner said Stoughton had his
headquarters
Arriving there he hammered loudly on the door with a revolver butt
An upstairs window opened and a head in a nightcap was thrust out
What the devils all the noise about its owner demanded Dont you
know this is General Stoughtons headquarters
Id hoped it was I almost killed a horse getting here Mosby
retorted Come down and open up dispatches from Washington
In a few moments a light appeared inside on the first floor and the
door opened A man in a nightshirt holding a candle stood in the
doorway
Im Lieutenant Prentiss on General Stoughtons staff The generals
asleep If youll give me the dispatches
Mosby caught the man by the throat with his left hand and shoved a
Colt into his face with his right Dan Thomas beside him lifted the
candle out of the other mans hand
And Im Captain Mosby General Stuarts staff Weve just taken
Fairfax Courthouse Inside now and take me to the general at once
The general was in bed lying on his face in a tangle of bedclothes
Mosby pulled the sheets off of him lifted the tail of his nightshirt
and slapped him across the bare rump
The effect was electric Stoughton sat up in bed gobbling in fury In
the dim candlelight he mistook the gray of Mosbys tunic for blue
and began a string of bloodthirsty threats of courtmartial and firing
squad interspersed with oaths
Easy now General the perpetrator of the outrage soothed Youve
heard of John Mosby havent you
Yes have you captured him In the face of such tidings Stoughton
would gladly forget the assault on his person
Mosby shook his head smiling seraphically No General Hes
captured you Im Mosby
Oh my God Stoughton sank back on the pillow and closed his eyes
overcome
Knowing the precarious nature of his present advantage Mosby then
undertook to deprive Stoughton of any hope of rescue or will to
resist
Stuarts cavalry is occupying Fairfax Courthouse he invented and
Stonewall Jacksons at Chantilly with his whole force Were all
moving to occupy Alexandria by morning Youll have to hurry and
dress General
Is Fitzhugh Lee here Stoughton asked Hes a friend of mine we
were classmates at West Point
Why no hes with Jackson at Chantilly Do you want me to take you
to him I can do so easily if you hurry
It does not appear that Stoughton doubted as much as one syllable of
this remarkable set of prevarications The Union Army had learned by
bitter experience that Stonewall Jackson was capable of materializing
almost anywhere So he climbed out of bed putting on his clothes
On the way back to the courthouse square Prentiss got away from them
in the darkness but Mosby kept a tight hold on Stoughtons bridle By
this time the suspicion that all was not well in the county seat had
begun to filter about Men were beginning to turn out under arms all
