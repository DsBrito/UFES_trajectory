A noise as of a sea in tempest torn
By warring winds  The stormy blast of hell
With restless fury drives the spirits on
Whirld round and dashd amain with sore annoy
When they arrive before the ruinous sweep
There shrieks are heard there lamentations moans
And blasphemies gainst the good Power in heaven
I understood that to this torment sad
The carnal sinners are condemnd in whom
Reason by lust is swayd  As in large troops
And multitudinous when winter reigns
The starlings on their wings are borne abroad
So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls
On this side and on that above below
It drives them hope of rest to solace them
Is none nor een of milder pang  As cranes
Chanting their dolrous notes traverse the sky
Stretchd out in long array so I beheld
Spirits who came loud wailing hurried on
By their dire doom  Then I Instructor who
Are these by the black air so scourgdThe first
Mong those of whom thou questionst he replied
Oer many tongues was empress  She in vice
Of luxury was so shameless that she made
Liking be lawful by promulgd decree
To clear the blame she had herself incurrd
This is Semiramis of whom tis writ
That she succeeded Ninus her espousd
And held the land which now the Soldan rules
The next in amorous fury slew herself
And to Sicheus ashes broke her faith
Then follows Cleopatra lustful queen
There markd I Helen for whose sake so long
The time was fraught with evil there the great
Achilles who with love fought to the end
Paris I saw and Tristan and beside
A thousand more he showd me and by name
Pointed them out whom love bereavd of life
When I had heard my sage instructor name
Those dames and knights of antique days oerpowerd
By pity wellnigh in amaze my mind
Was lost and I began Bard willingly
I would address those two together coming
Which seem so light before the wind  He thus
Note thou when nearer they to us approach
Then by that love which carries them along
Entreat and they will come  Soon as the wind
Swayd them toward us I thus framd my speech
O wearied spirits come and hold discourse
With us if by none else restraind  As doves
By fond desire invited on wide wings
And firm to their sweet nest returning home
Cleave the air wafted by their will along
Thus issud from that troop where Dido ranks
They through the ill air speeding with such force
My cry prevaild by strong affection urgd
O gracious creature and benign who gost
Visiting through this element obscure
Us who the world with bloody stain imbrud
If for a friend the King of all we ownd
Our prayr to him should for thy peace arise
Since thou hast pity on our evil plight
f whatsoeer to hear or to discourse
It pleases thee that will we hear of that
Freely with thee discourse while eer the wind
As now is mute  The land that gave me birth
Is situate on the coast where Po descends
To rest in ocean with his sequent streams
Love that in gentle heart is quickly learnt
Entangled him by that fair form from me
Taen in such cruel sort as grieves me still
Love that denial takes from none belovd
Caught me with pleasing him so passing well
That as thou seest he yet deserts me not
Love brought us to one death Caina waits
The soul who spilt our life  Such were their words
At hearing which downward I bent my looks
And held them there so long that the bard cried
What art thou pondring  I in answer thus
Alas by what sweet thoughts what fond desire
Must they at length to that ill pass have reachd
Then turning I to them my speech addressd
And thus began Francesca your sad fate
Even to tears my grief and pity moves
But tell me in the time of your sweet sighs
By what and how love granted that ye knew
Your yet uncertain wishes  She replied
No greater grief than to remember days
Of joy when misry is at hand  That kens
Thy learnd instructor  Yet so eagerly
If thou art bent to know the primal root
From whence our love gat being I will do
As one who weeps and tells his tale  One day
For our delight we read of Lancelot
How him love thralld  Alone we were and no
Suspicion near us  Ofttimes by that reading
Our eyes were drawn together and the hue
Fled from our alterd cheek  But at one point
Alone we fell  When of that smile we read
The wished smile rapturously kissd
By one so deep in love then he who neer
From me shall separate at once my lips
All trembling kissd  The book and writer both
Were loves purveyors  In its leaves that day
We read no more  While thus one spirit spake
The other waild so sorely that heartstruck
I through compassion fainting seemd not far
From death and like a corpse fell to the ground
CANTO VI
MY sense reviving that erewhile had droopd
With pity for the kindred shades whence grief
Oercame me wholly straight around I see
New torments new tormented souls which way
Soeer I move or turn or bend my sight
In the third circle I arrive of showrs
Ceaseless accursed heavy and cold unchangd
For ever both in kind and in degree
Large hail discolourd water sleety flaw
Through the dun midnight air streamd down amain
Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell
Cerberus cruel monster fierce and strange
Through his wide threefold throat barks as a dog
Over the multitude immersd beneath
His eyes glare crimson black his unctuous beard
His belly large and clawd the hands with which
He tears the spirits flays them and their limbs
Piecemeal disparts  Howling there spread as curs
Under the rainy deluge with one side
The other screening oft they roll them round
A wretched godless crew  When that great worm
Descried us savage Cerberus he opd
His jaws and the fangs showd us not a limb
Of him but trembled  Then my guide his palms
Expanding on the ground thence filled with earth
Raisd them and cast it in his ravenous maw
Een as a dog that yelling bays for food
His keeper when the morsel comes lets fall
His fury bent alone with eager haste
To swallow it so droppd the loathsome cheeks
Of demon Cerberus who thundring stuns
The spirits that they for deafness wish in vain
We oer the shades thrown prostrate by the brunt
Of the heavy tempest passing set our feet
Upon their emptiness that substance seemd
They all along the earth extended lay
Save one that sudden raisd himself to sit
Soon as that way he saw us pass  O thou
He cried who through the infernal shades art led
Own if again thou knowst me  Thou wast framd
Or ere my frame was broken  I replied
The anguish thou endurst perchance so takes
Thy form from my remembrance that it seems
As if I saw thee never  But inform
Me who thou art that in a place so sad
Art set and in such torment that although
Other be greater more disgustful none
Can be imagind  He in answer thus
Thy city heapd with envy to the brim
Ay that the measure overflows its bounds
Held me in brighter days  Ye citizens
Were wont to name me Ciacco  For the sin
Of gluttny damned vice beneath this rain
Een as thou seest I with fatigue am worn
Nor I sole spirit in this woe all these
Have by like crime incurrd like punishment
No more he said and I my speech resumd
Ciacco thy dire affliction grieves me much
Even to tears  But tell me if thou knowst
What shall at length befall the citizens
Of the divided city whether any just one
Inhabit there and tell me of the cause
Whence jarring discord hath assaild it thus
He then After long striving they will come
To blood and the wild party from the woods
Will chase the other with much injury forth
Then it behoves that this must fall within
Three solar circles and the other rise
By borrowd force of one who under shore
Now rests  It shall a long space hold aloof
Its forehead keeping under heavy weight
The other oppressd indignant at the load
And grieving sore  The just are two in number
But they neglected  Avrice envy pride
Three fatal sparks have set the hearts of all
On fire  Here ceasd the lamentable sound
And I continud thus Still would I learn
More from thee farther parley still entreat
Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say
They who so well deservd of Giacopo
Arrigo Mosca and the rest who bent
Their minds on working good  Oh tell me where
They bide and to their knowledge let me come
For I am pressd with keen desire to hear
If heavens sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell
Be to their lip assignd   He answerd straight
These are yet blacker spirits  Various crimes
Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss
If thou so far descendest thou mayst see them
But to the pleasant world when thou returnst
Of me make mention I entreat thee there
No more I tell thee answer thee no more
This said his fixed eyes he turnd askance
A little eyd me then bent down his head
And midst his blind companions with it fell
When thus my guide No more his bed he leaves
Ere the last angeltrumpet blow  The Power
Adverse to these shall then in glory come
Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair
Resume his fleshly vesture and his form
And hear the eternal doom reechoing rend
The vault  So passd we through that mixture foul
Of spirits and rain with tardy steps meanwhile
Touching though slightly on the life to come
For thus I questiond Shall these tortures Sir
When the great sentence passes be increasd
Or mitigated or as now severe
He then Consult thy knowledge that decides
That as each thing to more perfection grows
It feels more sensibly both good and pain
Though neer to true perfection may arrive
This race accursd yet nearer then than now
They shall approach it  Compassing that path
Circuitous we journeyed and discourse
Much more than I relate between us passd
Till at the point where the steps led below
Arrivd there Plutus the great foe we found
