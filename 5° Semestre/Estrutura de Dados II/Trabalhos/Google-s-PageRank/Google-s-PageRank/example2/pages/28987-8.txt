SUNLIGHT PATCH
CHAPTER I
OUT OF THE WILDERNESS
He appeared an odd figure sitting loosely on an old white mare which
held her nose to the ground and cautiously singlefooted over the uneven
road Unconcerned perhaps unconscious that he bestrode a horse his
head was thrown back and his gaze penetrated the lacework of branches
to a sky exquisite blue where a few white puffy clouds were aimlessly
suspended And like these clouds his thoughts hovered between
unrealized hopes and the realistic mountains he was leaving thoughts
interwoven with ambitions which had obsessed his waking hours and
glorified his dreamsdreams desires ambitions always before his eyes
but out of reach His hair fell to the opened collar of a homespun
shirt and homespun were his trousers tucked into a pair of homemade
boots His saddle bore an obscure brand of the United States army for
it had carried one of his people through the War of the States fifty
years before and across its pummel balanced a long ungainly rifle of
an earlier period
It was an afternoon of that month when the spirit of Kentucky arises
from the loamy soil after a recreating sleep of winter The fragrance of
the earth was everywhere Overhead the trees met in great silent
archesNatures Gothic refrescoed now in the delicate tints of spring
by the brush of Natures Masterbeneath which all life seemed
breathlessly poised as though in this dimlit sundappled cathedral of
the forest a mute service were in progress But the manhe did not seem
to see or feel or be Thus without a sound except for the muffled
shuffle of the old mares unshod hoofs he rode
They were coming down the mountain he and the old white mare coming
down into the valley into the settlements and today marked the last
stage of his journey from the center of those wild giants which had
bounded the territory of his twentytwo years existence Today he
would emerge from the foothills into the open country into the smiling
country of his imagination from somewhere in whose expanding fields now
came the call of a toiling plowboy It was this which finally brought
him from his reverie in the sky from his lofty dreams to the smell of
earth
Drawing down his gaze he saw that here indeed was the open threshold
of a new world and his eyes distended with a veritable glory of sight
They had seen distance but not like this They had ranged from mountain
peak to mountain peak or across the scarred tops of intervening peaks
to a skyline untamed even by the coaxing tints of rose and purple
sunsets but before him now lay distance of another kind hills upon
hills twas true yet low and whose once rough lines were mellowed by
the patient surgery of a hundred years of plowshares Gentle slopes and
shallow valleys and slopes againnot standing like his graven monsters
of the Cumberlands but lolling in peace and lazy unconcern melting
into the azure west so artfully that he could not be definitely sure
where earth left off and sky began And between these softly molded
forms was no towering harshness at whose contemplation his eyes would
intuitively have narrowed but a subdued carpet of many fields with
here and there a nestling home A grand sweeping canvas it might have
been whose browns of newturned soil whose light green tints of reborn
orchards and sprouting wheat were gracefully interrupted by the deeper
tones of clustered treesthose remnants of primeval forest which the
unintentional landscape gardeners of pioneer days had chanced to leave
standing in this picturesque Kentucky valley
A welcome seemed to rise from it like soothing fingers laid upon his
brow and his frame drooped in extreme contentment for it portrayed the
country he had come to seek from his home back in that wilderness where
bridlepaths are boulevards and primitive log cabins the mansions of his
people So he continued to sit spellbound held between the
satisfaction of lingering and the impulse to ride down into it and to
rest there as everything seemed to be resting in a soft growth of
plenty This was decided by the mare which of her own accord turned
and started on
He did not again draw rein for many miles The needle of his nature
urged him forward straight along a narrow valley lane that ambled
between mildewed fences and their inclosed fields between untouched
walls of wildgrape redbud and blossoming dogwood and he knew that
his intuition was not sending him astray This sweetsmelling road was
now making another turn which ushered him directly upon a frame
schoolhouse set slightly back in a grove of trees Quickly he brought
the old mare to a stop
That it was a schoolhousethe very schoolhouse which had been the
reliquary of his dreamshe never doubted so accurately did it fit the
description given by a mountain preacher and to be actually facing it
in the material form filled him with a nameless fascination Sitting
rigid in an attitude bent forward his tense stare directed on its
partly open door he suggested a Marathon runner crouched for the start
of that great trial and somewhere in his subconsciousness a voice
whispered that this day this hour marked the beginning of his mortal
race He comprehended a certain vague significance to which analysis was
denied
Then slowly dismounting he led the mare deep into an opposite thicket
There was no necessity for doing this no reason except the latent
sense of caution a wild creature feels in strange places and having
concealed his rifle beneath a fallen log he turned back to the road
But now he hesitated putting one hand against a tree for support A
close observer might have seen that his body was swaying slightly from
side to side with a curious movement not unlike the restive motion of a
caged beast and a glance at his face would have confirmed the
existence of some overwhelming emotion In a deep drawling voice he
spoke
Wall Ruth I reckon hyar hit air cause hit looks jest like the
preacher said Now help my arms ter keep hit with me n pray the Lawd
ter make my haid larn all the larnin hits got shet up in thar N
tell Him ter give my eyes the fust sight of ary danged skunk thatll
try ter crowd me outen hit sos I kin kill im till he rots in hell
n Ill be the Christian ye asked me ter
A gentle almost a childish smile of satisfaction played across his
mouth and the next moment he was walking forward carefully and
reverently as though the little schoolhouse were on holy ground
The afternoon was waning and the declining sun cast a genial glow upon
the weatherboarded front gilding too the near side of a crooked
flagpole set jauntily in the yard Except for evidences of recent life
the place seemed utterly deserted and emboldened even though
disappointed by this he went up to the door Here again he hesitated
for some one within was speaking It was a womans voice raised in
command and fear
CHAPTER II
AN UNEXPECTED RESCUE
You may go home now she was saying There was a pause which carried
no sign or sound of movement You may go home dont you understand
It was a voice that to the listening mountaineer seemed inexpressibly
sweet and caressing in spite of the determination which made it a bit
unsteady Still no answer The silence was becoming unnatural
Tusk she said again dont stand before me like this Go home
Not knowing exactly what to do but in a vague way feeling that he might
be needed the stranger stepped cautiously to the door and peered in
With her back to the blackboard and her arms rigid against her sides
altogether in an attitude of one at bay stood a girl He first noticed
that her hands were tightly clenched and then his look went upward
Streaming through the window the same golden rays that burnished the
weatherboards and flagpole touched the looser strands of her hair
This against the background of black framed her upraised face with a
halo of lustrous glory softening the parted lips rather than showing
them to be stamped with fear but not disguising the terror which leapt
from her eyes as they stared fairly hypnotized at an ungainly man who
stood leering down at her His head was set deep between massive
stooping shoulders and his arms were abnormally long while the color
of his face indicated a diet at some period of his life of clay and
berries Two fanglike teeth curving outward as the tusks of a wild
boarhaving furnished inspiration for the name by which he was most
popularly knownadded a last fierce touch to his repulsive features
Go home the girl repeated now in a weaker voice
It aint time to go home he growled When kids dont know their
lessons you make em stay in dont you Well Im astayin too
Let me by this instant she commanded plucking another crumb of
courage from the sheer imminence of danger
Aw come off yoh high airs he leered Aint you been standin me up
afore the school an actin me like a fool I aint kicked have I
Well what you want to go cuttin up for now
Brains partly numbed or overexcited by shock sometimes take queer and
irrelevant channels of thought and now the only thing on which she
seemed able to concentrate was a duel she had witnessed on that very
schoolhouse window sill but the previous day a duel between a locust
and a wasp They had fallen there in deadly embrace the clumsier
holding his antagonist by brute strength that ultimately would break its
frail body but the wily wasp conscious of this danger sent thrust
after thrust of its venomous stinger with lightning stabs up and down
its enemys armor trusting to chance that a vulnerable spot might be
found between the scales She had watched this struggle with a
breathless pleasurefor at times she could be pagan as of oldand when
at last the little point slipped through she felt no pity for the
locust rather was she tempted to stroke the victor as it crawled from
the suddenly relaxed grip of its stiffening foe laved its wings
polished its legs and rose into the air
Weak with the consciousness of her peril this mental byplay urged her
to the necessity of speed and like the stinger her mind began an
hysterical thrusting for a more subtle method of defense
Tusk Im sorry I stood you up before the class she tried in
speaking kindly to hide her loathing But now you must go home at
once or I shall never be able to let you come to school again
He laughed outright
Wont never let me come no moh Well now jest heah that Why sissy
youd ortent git so mad Kiss me like a nice gal an lets make up
You beast she cried her fear suddenly bursting into an irresistible
rage You beast she cried again striking him in the face with all
her strength Youll be killed for this
For an instant he was stunned by the surprise of her attack but then
blind with fury his gorillalike arms shot out and caught her just as
she was turning to dash toward the door
During this scene the newcomer had made several determinations to enter
yet each was checked by a consciousness that he did not belong to this
country where he had been told strange customs prevailed He was not at
all sure but that an interference would be seriously inapt Once or
twice he had been on the verge of stealing back into the thicket for his
rifle yet the schoolhouse drama held him too firmly chained for this
Adopting now a middle course he went up the four steps and entered with
an innocent air of one having just arrived Blinking with a pretended
effort to make out the interior he mildly asked
Is this Miss Janes school
Tusk sprang back with a snarl while the girl twisting free and
frantically recovering her balance came toward the new voice with hands
outstretched bumping against the desks as one who had suddenly gone
blind She could not speak she could scarcely think and only by the
sternest force of will would her knees bear up but somewhere in front
of her stood deliverance and to this she groped
Howdy the new voice spoke again as she felt a hand take one of her
own and press her toward a seat Ye look peaked maybe yed better
set
Her composure was returning in bounds for this girl herself born in
the mountains possessed too much innate fortitude to be long dominated
by fear
Thank you her voice still trembled II must have been frightened
Then quickly Yes this is Miss Janes school and I am Miss Jane
A curious sound rattled in the newcomers throat and his chin dropped
with stupid amazement For a long moment he stared at her his pupils
dilating and contracting in a strangely fascinating way and his body
beginning slowly to rock from side to side as it had done in the thicket
across the road But just now she was meeting his gaze with a look of
excited gladness
Yeou Miss Jane he murmured each syllable vibrating with some deep
timbre of admiration and protection Another moment he stared then his
eyes turned and rested unflinchingly on Tusk It was a look particularly
expressive neither of surprise nor condemnation hatred nor scorn yet
its very impassivity carried a pulsing sense of danger as though
something terrible were on the verge of happening and the various
elements of destruction were being hurriedly assembled But quietly he
turned again to the girl
Lucys outside Maybe yed better let her take ye home
Oh ask her to come in she cried feeling the need of a woman perhaps
more than at any time in her life and now fearful of another sort of
tragedy She was not sure of how much this newcomer had seen but his
look at Tusk was eloquent of one thing that if these men were left
alone the building would receive its first stain of human blood She
wanted to spare her schoolhouse this It was her boast that no life
should go out by violence beneath its roof for it had long been a
recognized custom in wilder regions of this country for men to choose
the wayside schools the scattered churches or crossroads stores as
places from which to usher obtrusive neighbors into eternal rest
Wall she cant do that the newcomer thoughtfully replied seein as
how shes my ole mare But ye mought take her n go home Me n this
fellerll watch yo school
Looking from one to the other weighing the chances of outwitting Tusk
she lightly suggested
My own horse is in the shed You may help me put on the saddle
All right he readily answered N yeou he turned to Tusk now
watching them with growing malignancy wait hyar till I git back then
verily verily I say unto ye well cast another devil outen the Lawds
temple
She was alert to acquiesce in this Her instinct said that unless
something tentative were left in view some further part of the drama
held out to be played the simpleminded Tusk would stop their going
His dwarfed intelligence gauged to one idea might be satisfied to wait
only if waiting promised a climax And as for the others
returningthis newfound deliverer who was so thoroughly of the
mountains yet whose dialect just now had savored of the circuitrider
typeshe felt able to cope with that exigency after they were outside
So in her eagerness she had arisen when Tusk stepped roughly to the
door and slammed it
Nobodys goin home tonight he growled turning and glaring at them
His eyes set unusually deep and close together flashed murder and the
girl sank weakly back into a seat For she knew Tusks strength She had
seen him shoulder a log under which two men were struggling and walk
firmly away with it The very consciousness alone of this power was
oppressive He could crush this other man with a blow
A soft answer turneth away wrath a quiet voice whispered down to her
and continued Let the gal out she wants ter go home
If youre some kind of a preacher Tusk snarled at him having also
noticed the Biblical character of speech git out yohsef But the gal
stays right heah till Im ready fer her to go An young feller mebbe
shell be let go home or mebbe shell come long with meI aint
decided but I wont be hindered by no one His voice was trembling
with increasing passion Nows yoh time to git Mister Preacher or by
Gawd He drew a long dirty knife from a hidden sheath and seemed
unable to complete the sentence for his excited breathing
I haint a preacher the other quietly replied to him but Ive jest
been sendin a message ter the Lawd this very evenin n I reckon He
had me come in heah ter look ye over bein as how ye air one of them
sorry skunks Im arter And without warning he sprang like a panther at
the offenders throat
The shock of his body sent Tusk backwards tripping him over a desk
where both men went down in a heap Almost before they struck the floor
the newcomer cried to her
Git the critter n ride Schoolteacher Hits yo only chance
He had no more time to warn for a series of sounds sickening bestial
sounds told of a terrific struggle as feet and bodies and elbows dully
crashed against the desks on either side It was a narrow aisle in which
to fight
Yet she was not made of the stuff that would mount a horse and fly Her
early life when as a slip of a girl she stood many a night with rifle
in hand filling the place of lookout for an outlaw father who trafficked
in moonshine whisky had taught her to be careless of physical dangers
The terrors of a different sort of passion she had never known but now
with this averted her nature leapt beyond the past eight years of
trainingeight years spent in fitting herself as teacher for this
schooland transported her to those early days of partial savagery
Again she was the little mountain outlaw and the feeling was good and
her heart bounded with a primeval pleasure of this excitement which was
routing every previous qualm of fright Bent breathlessly forward her
hands clenched into revengeful little fists her cheeks and eyes aflame
and eager her lips apart and her nostrils dilated as though in very
truth they sought the smell of battle she was not a picture of one who
would mount a horse and fly
At the first rush Tusks knife had fallen from his hand and now lay
almost at her feet Stooping impulsively she seized it while at the
same moment he uttered a low chuckle of satisfaction and started to
arise He did not move as one entirely free but clinging to a burden
and when his shoulders slowly appeared she saw that he was lifting the
other man who still struck ineffectually at his face Handling him
with no great exertion he backed against a desk and forced the body
between his knees then placing one huge hairy hand behind his victims
ear and the other beneath his chin he began calmly to twist
Jane realized the hellishness of this move which with cruel certainty
would break the yielding neck The mountaineer also knew and put his
remaining strength into the struggle yet only for a moment did it seem
to divert Tusks purpose
If the girl had previously looked the beautiful savage she now became
its incarnation With an agonized cry she screamed at him to stop but
his answer was to pin the man more firmly and recommence the murderous
twisting
It was a matter of seconds now Any instant she might hear the snap and
see the one who was giving his life for her quiver and become still No
longer hesitating she flew at them with the blade raised high and
poised herself for the stroke Yet she could not send it Again she
tried and a sob of rage burst from her throat as the hand refused to
obey Had the creature turned it might have been less difficult but
the utter revulsion of driving steel into unsuspecting and unresisting
flesh was more than she could master Slowly the head was yielding to
those horrible hands and the newcomers eyes rested on her own for the
merest instant It was the look of a courageous man sinking beneath
waves but the sweat and whipcord veins were eloquent of his frenzied
resistance
Someones coming Someones coming she suddenly cried rushing to the
door and flinging it wide open
Tusk looked up with a snarl
Quick Quick she cried again Here this wayquick Hes killing a
man Oh thank God She sprang back into the room rapturously clasping
the knife to her breast Theyve come Theyve come
With an oath Tusk flung his victim heavily to the floor and dashed to a
rear window through which he disappeared She watched only long enough
to see that his rout was absolutethat her ruse of approaching help had
been successful Then she turned
The room seemed dark to her eyes which had just been peering into the
sunsets fading glow and she walked with feeling steps toward the spot
where she knew the body lay asking in a whisper Are you alive The
heavy silence made her shiver There at her feet sprawled the shadowy
bulk twisted and grotesque and an uncontrollable feeling of loathing
crept over her
With startling suddenness a quail close by the open door ripped out
his evening call and she sprang back as though the thing upon the floor
had moved Yet she continued to stare down at it her cold hands pressed
against her burning cheeksfascinated horrified A few little minutes
ago he had been a moving feeling being like herself and now he had
entered the portals of that mysterious eternityat this very moment he
was standing before the calm scrutiny of God Himself How was he
behaving in that great inspection Trembling with bowed head like
herself Or smiling with a courage he had shown during his last earthly
moments while giving his life for her
So vivid were these thoughts which raced like fury through her brain
that when the body did actually move she gave a piercing shriek of
terror But she had recovered even before the echo of her voice
resounded through the little room and instantly alert brought the
drinking bucket from its shelf to bathe his face
Kneeling thereor rather in an attitude of sitting on her crossed
feeteagerly watching for another sign of life the tenderness which
spoke in mute eloquence from every movement of her ministrations for the
stranger who had stood between her and insult was a boon that might
have repaid any man for worse hurts than his She drew his head upon her
lap and began carefully to staunch a trickle of blood flowing from a
small cut in his temple
The sun went down regretfully backing out of sight and by its slow
retreat seeming loath to leave them to the somber night She did not
notice its decline but in the afterglow leaned nearer pushing back his
matted hair and searching each of his wellmolded features There was
nothing of a personal interest in the look there was nothing in the
contact of their touch that aroused in her the least personal appeal He
was merely a thing hurt a thing wounded in her defense
Again from outside the window came a call the swinging twilighteerie
notes of a whippoorwill while from afar off somewhere in the black
woods hooted an owl Softly but with a restless spirit the
nightwind began to stir and a murmur like the winnowing of many
wings passed tremulously through the branches which swept the
schoolhouse roof But now she was unafraid
CHAPTER III
THE WOUNDED MOUNTAINEER
She was no longer fearful for his life Saner deductions had recalled
how he was fighting up to the moment Tusk threw him off and this
precluded the probability of a broken neck The small abrasion over his
temple where it must have struck a desk could alone be responsible for
the unconsciousness which she now felt assured would soon be passing
Had Jane been dressed as a nun the picture she made with the young
mountaineers head upon her lap would have startled the world None of
those discerning critics who stalk the galleries on varnishing day could
have passed a canvas such as this without bending their rusty knees at
least one creak in humble reverence For God had carefully blessed her
with a Madonnalike loveliness a matchless purity which held
enthralled all who came suddenly upon that look Perhaps it was not
known in Heaven where she got her smile It was this when rippling from
eyes to mouth and lingering about the ovals of her cheeks that could
have swayed Faith upon its base or chained it thrice firmly to the Rock
She had first acquired a pleasant suspicion of this years before in the
convent up the valley where the good sisters had given her shelter
Early one morning on mischief bent at the very peep of dawn she had
filched the garb of old sister Methtune and supporting its bulky skirt
demurely walked into the Mother Superiors sanctified chamber What that
good woman thought as she raised herself up from her couch is not
recorded even in her conscience but Jane was sent in haste to replace
the nuns attire While passing a glass door in a dimly lit hall she
saw for the first time in her life her own face For five ten minutes
she continued to look back into this heretofore undiscovered and sinful
reflector sometimes laughing sometimes making grimaces Then for
another ten minutes she simply stared Sister Methune was late getting
to her devotions that morning
But this incident had occurred eight years ago when she was scarcely
thirteen Until then she had literally grown up like a weedor a wild
rosea halfsavage little creature of the Cumberlands loving
passionately hating blindly doing all things with the full intensity
of a vivid wholesouled temperament She lived in a cabin many miles
from the more civilized country where the convent lay under the
questionable protection of a noted feudist father who was usually
making moonshine when not stalking his enemies Her cherished glimpses
of civilization came during one month each yearJulywhen she picked
especially fat and luscious blackberries in remote spots known only to
her and sold them in the valley to Colonel John May whose white
columned house might be seen on clear days from the convent tower
One of her visits happened upon a day when the place was enlivened by
his daughters approaching wedding A distinguished houseparty had
assembled among whom a citybred young fellow had been attracted by her
wild beauty Safe from the eyes of his friends he followed her through
the woodland pasture and talked to her and it had seemed a very
natural thing Mountain girls mature early and she was a woman for all
her tender years a twelve and a half year old woman partly savage
masquerading in the guise of a girl He was dazzling to her and
pleasing But suddenly he kissed her and infuriated she flung the
empty bucket in his face and fled The gods may know where she learned
the difference between right and wrong
In a passion of shame and bitter hatred she hurled back at him every
oath her father in his most prolific moments had ever used It was a
wondrous collection Her only idea was to reach home and return with the
rifle and so insistent was this that she ran most of the twelve
intervening miles Reaching at last the cabin clearing she panted up
its steep side through burnt stumps and sparsely growing corn to the
door but there across the sill her father lay face down and motionless
He might have been drunk and so at first she thought until her
approach revealed a little hole in the back of his head She stared at
him like an image of wood then sank upon the floor putting her lips
close to his ear
Pappy she said in a quick whisper Pappy tell me who done hit I
know ye air daidbut cant ye tell me jest that
Her first impulse was of revenge but slowly the loveunmerited as it
may have beenand the sense of loss of loneliness came over her like
a great wave and with her face on his still shoulder she wailed her
wretched grief to the silent wilderness When she looked up it was
sundown She realized that whoever had killed him might come back for
hermight now indeed be layin out for her and yet she could not
leave him unburied Her hands grasped his shirt and she frantically
tugged bracing her heels against the roughly hewn log doorstep in a
vague way hoping that she might drag him to a spot where the ground
would be soft enough to dig A few minutes of this fruitless effort
compelled her to give it up
Pappy cant ye help me jest a leetle she had whispered in despair
And then the tears would flow again
