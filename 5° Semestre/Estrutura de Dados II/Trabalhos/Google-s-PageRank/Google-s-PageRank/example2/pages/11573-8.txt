present century as is known today In such a dearth of precise
information it may very well have happened that many things occurred
touching which we have not said even one word Again it should never be
forgotten that generations were born lived their time died and have
been forgotten among those remote groups about which no civilized man
ever has or ever will hear anything If such be admitted to be the
facts why may not all that is here related have happened and equally
escape the knowledge of the rest of the civilized world During the wars
of the French revolution trifling events attracted but little of the
general attention and we are not to think of interests of this nature
in that day as one would think of them now
Whatever may be thought of the authenticity of its incidents we hope
this book will be found not to be totally without a moral Truth is not
absolutely necessary to the illustration of a principle the imaginary
sometimes doing that office quite as effectually as the actual
The reader may next wish to know why the wonderful events related in
these volumes have so long been hidden from the world In answer to this
we would ask if anyone can tell how many thousands of years the waters
have tumbled down the cliffs at Niagara or why it was that civilized
men heard of the existence of this wonderful cataract so lately as only
three centuries since The fact is there must be a beginning to
everything and now there is a beginning to the worlds knowing the
history of Vulcans Peak and the Crater Lest the reader however
should feel disposed to reproach the past age with having been negligent
in its collection of historical and geological incidents we would again
remind him of the magnitude of the events that so naturally occupied its
attention It is scarcely possible for instance for one who did not
live forty years ago to have any notion how completely the world was
engaged in wondering at Napoleon and his marvellous career which last
contained even more extraordinary features than anything related here
though certainly of a very different character All wondering for near
a quarter of a century was monopolized by the French Revolution and its
consequences
There are a few explanations however which are of a very humble nature
compared with the principal events of our history but which may as well
be given here The Woolston family still exists in Pennsylvania and
that by the way is something towards corroborating the truth of our
narrative Its most distinguished member is recently dead and his
journal has been the authority for most of the truths here related He
died at a good old age having seen his threescore years and ten
leaving behind him in addition to a very ample estate not only a good
character which means neither more nor less than what the neighbours
amid their ignorance envy love of detraction jealousy and other
similar qualities might think proper to say of him but the odour of a
wellspent life in which he struggled hard to live more in favour with
God than in favour with man It was remarked in him for the last forty
years of his life or after his return to Bucks that he regarded all
popular demonstrations with distaste and as some of his enemies
pretended with contempt Nevertheless he strictly acquitted himself of
all his public duties and never neglected to vote It is believed that
his hopes for the future meaning in a social and earthly sense were
not very vivid and he was often heard to repeat that warning text of
Scripture which tells us Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed
lest he fall
The faithful and once lovely partner of this principal personage of our
history is also dead It would seem that it was not intended they should
be long asunder But their time was come and they might almost be said
to have departed in company The same is true of Friends Robert and
Martha who have also filled their time and gone hence it is to be
hoped to a better world Some few of the younger persons of our drama
still exist but it has been remarked of them that they avoid
conversing of the events of their younger days Youth is the season of
hope and hope disappointed has little to induce us to dwell on its
deceptive pictures
If those who now live in this republic can see any grounds for a timely
warning in the events here recorded it may happen that the mercy of a
divine Creator may still preserve that which he has hitherto cherished
and protected
It remains only to say that we have endeavoured to imitate the
simplicity of Captain Woolstons journal in writing this book and
should any homeliness of style be discovered we trust it will be
imputed to that circumstance
The Crater
Chapter I
Twas a commodity lay fretting by you
Twill bring you gain or perish on the seas
Taming of the Shrew
There is nothing in which American Liberty not always as much
restrained as it might be has manifested a more decided tendency to run
riot than in the use of names As for Christian names the Heathen
Mythology the Bible Ancient History and all the classics have long
since been exhausted and the organ of invention has been at work with
an exuberance of imagination that is really wonderful for such a
matteroffact people Whence all the strange sounds have been derived
which have thus been pressed into the service of this human
nomenclature it would puzzle the most ingenious philologist to say The
days of the Kates and Dollys and Pattys and Bettys have passed away
and in their stead we hear of Lowinys and Orchistrys Philenys
Alminys Cytherys Sarahlettys Amindys Marindys c c c All these
last appellations terminate properly with an a but this unfortunate
vowel when a final letter being popularly pronounced like y we have
adapted our spelling to the sound which produces a complete bathos to
all these flights in taste
The hero of this narrative was born fully sixty years since and happily
before the rage for modern appellations though he just escaped being
named after another system which we cannot say we altogether admire
that of using a family for a christian name This business of names is
a sort of science in itself and we do believe that it is less
understood and less attended to in this country than in almost all
others When a Spaniard writes his name as Juan de Castro y1 Munos we
know that his father belonged to the family of Castro and his mother to
that of Munos The French and Italian and Russian woman c writes
on her card Madame this or that born so and so all which tells the
whole history of her individuality Many French women in signing their
names prefix those of their own family to those of their husbands a
sensible and simple usage that we are glad to see is beginning to obtain
among ourselves The records on tombstones too might be made much
more clear and useful than they now are by stating distinctly who the
party was on both sides of the house or by father and mother and each
married woman ought to be commemorated in some such fashion as this
Here lies Jane Smith wife of John Jones c or Jane daughter of
Thomas Smith and wife of John Jones We believe that in some
countries a womans name is not properly considered to be changed by
marriage but she becomes a Mrs only in connection with the name of her
husband Thus Jane Smith becomes Mrs John Jones but not Mrs Jane
Jones It is on this idea we suppose that our ancestors the
Englishevery Englishman as a matter of course being every Americans
ancestorthus it is we suppose therefore that our ancestors who pay
so much more attention to such matters than we do ourselves in their
table of courtesy call the wife of Lord John Russell Lady John and
not Ladywhatever her Christian name may happen to be We suppose
moreover it is on this principle that Mrs General This Mrs Dr That
and Mrs Senator Tother are as inaccurate as they are notoriously
vulgar
Footnote 1 Some few of our readers may require to be told that
in Spanish y pronounced as e is the simple conjunction and
thus this name is de Castro and Munos
Mark Woolston came from a part of this great republic where the names
are still as simple unpretending and as good Saxon English as in the
county of Kent itself He was born in the little town of Bristol Bucks
county Pennsylvania This is a portion of the country that Heaven be
praised still retains some of the good oldfashioned directness and
simplicity Bucks is full of Jacks and Bens and Dicks and we question
if there is such a creature of native growth in all that region as an
Ithusy or a Seneky or a Dianthy or an Antonizetty or a Deidamy2
The Woolstons in particular were a plain family and very unpretending
in their external appearance but of solid and highly respectable habits
around the domestic hearth Knowing perfectly how to spell they never
dreamed anyone would suspect them of ignorance They called themselves
as their forefathers were called that is to say Wooster or just as
Worcester is pronounced though a Yankee schoolmaster tried for a whole
summer to persuade our hero when a child that he ought to be styled
Woolston This had no effect on Mark who went on talking of his uncles
and aunts Josy Wooster and Tommy Wooster and Peggy Wooster
precisely as if a New England academy did not exist on earth or as if
Webster had not actually put Johnson under his feet
Footnote 2 Absurd and forced as these strange appellations may
appear they are all genuine The writer has collected a long list
of such names from real life which he may one day
publishOrchistra Philena and Almina are among them To all the
names ending in a it must be remembered that the sound of a final
y is given
The father of Mark Woolston or Wooster was a physician and for the
country and age was a welleducated and skilful man Mark was born in
1777 just seventy years since and only ten days before the surrender
of Burgoyne A good deal of attention was paid to his instruction and
fortunately for himself his servitude under the eastern pedagogue was
of very short duration and Mark continued to speak the English language
as his fathers had spoken it before him The difference on the score of
language between Pennsylvania and New Jersey and Maryland always
keeping in the counties that were not settled by Germans or Irish and
the New England states and through them New York is really so
obvious as to deserve a passing word In the states first named
taverns for instance are still called the Dun Cow the Indian Queen
or the Anchor whereas such a thing would be hard to find at this day
among the six millions of people who dwell in the latter We question
if there be such a thing as a coffeehouse in all Philadelphia though
we admit it with grief the respectable town of Brotherly Love has in
some respects become infected with the spirit of innovation Thus it is
that good old State House Yard has been changed into Independence
Square This certainly is not as bad as the tour de force of the
aldermen of Manhattan when they altered Bear Market into Washington
Market for it is not a prostitution of the name of a great man in the
first place and there is a direct historical allusion in the new name
that everybody can understand Still it is to be regretted and we hope
this will be the last thing of the sort that will ever occur though we
confers our confidence in Philadelphian stability and consistency is a
good deal lessened since we have learned by means of a late lawsuit
that there are fifty or sixty aldermen in the place a number of those
worthies that is quite sufficient to upset the proprieties in Athens
itself
Dr Woolston had a competitor in another physician who lived within a
mile of him and whose name was Yardley Dr Yardley was a very
respectable person had about the same degree of talents and knowledge
as his neighbour and rival but was much the richest man of the two Dr
Yardley however had but one child a daughter whereas Dr Woolston
with much less of means had sons and daughters Mark was the oldest of
the family and it was probably owing to this circumstance that he was
so well educated since the expense was not yet to be shared with that
of keeping his brothers and sisters at schools of the same character
In 1777 an American college was little better than a high school It
could not be called in strictness a grammar school inasmuch as all
the sciences were glanced at if not studied but as respects the
classics more than a grammar school it was not nor that of a very high
order It was a consequence of the light nature of the studies that
mere boys graduated in those institutions Such was the case with Mark
Woolston who would have taken his degree as a Bachelor of Arts at
Nassau Hall Princeton had not an event occurred in his sixteenth
year which produced an entire change in his plan of life and nipped
his academical honours in the bud
Although it is unusual for squarerigged vessels of any size to ascend
the Delaware higher than Philadelphia the river is in truth navigable
for such craft almost to Trenton Bridge In the year 1793 when Mark
Woolston was just sixteen a fullrigged ship actually came up and lay
at the end of the wharf in Burlington the little town nearly opposite
to Bristol where she attracted a great deal of the attention of all the
youths of the vicinity Mark was at home in a vacation and he passed
half his time in and about that ship crossing the river in a skiff of
which he was the owner in order to do so From that hour young Mark
affected the sea and all the tears of his mother and eldest sister the
latter a pretty girl only two years his junior and the more sober
advice of his father could not induce him to change his mind A six
weeks vacation was passed in the discussion of this subject when the
Doctor yielded to his sons importunities probably foreseeing he should
have his hands full to educate his other children and not unwilling to
put this child as early as possible in the way of supporting himself
The commerce of America in 1793 was already flourishing and
Philadelphia was then much the most important place in the country Its
East India trade in particular was very large and growing and Dr
Woolston knew that fortunes were rapidly made by many engaged in it
After turning the thing well over in his mind he determined to consult
Marks inclinations and to make a sailor of him He had a cousin
married to the sister of an East India or rather of a Canton
shipmaster and to this person the father applied for advice and
assistance Captain Crutchely very willingly consented to receive Mark
in his own vessel the Rancocus and promised to make a man and an
officer of him
The very day Mark first saw the ocean he was sixteen years old He had
got his height five feet eleven and was strong for his years and
active In fact it would not have been easy to find a lad every way so
well adapted to his new calling as young Mark Woolston The three years
of his college life if they had not made him a Newton or a Bacon had
done him no harm filling his mind with the germs of ideas that were
destined afterwards to become extremely useful to him The young man was
already indeed a sort of factotum being clever and handy at so many
things and in so many different ways as early to attract the attention
of the officers Long before the vessel reached the capes he was at
home in her from her truck to her keelson and Captain Crutchely
remarked to his chief mate the day they got to sea that young Mark
Woolston was likely to turn up a trump
As for Mark himself he did not lose sight of the land for the first
time in his life altogether without regrets He had a good deal of
feeling in connection with his parents and his brothers and sisters
but as it is our aim to conceal nothing which ought to be revealed we
must add there was still another who filled his thoughts more than all
the rest united This person was Bridget Yardley the only child of his
fathers most formidable professional competitor
The two physicians were obliged to keep up a sickly intercourse not
intending a pun They were too often called in to consult together to
maintain an open war While the heads of their respective families
occasionally met therefore at the bedside of their patients the
families themselves had no direct communications It is true that Mrs
Woolston and Mrs Yardley were occasionally to be seen seated at the
same teatable taking their hyson in company for the recent trade with
China had expelled the bohea from most of the better parlours of the
country nevertheless these good ladies could not get to be cordial
with each other They themselves had a difference on religious points
that was almost as bitter as the differences of opinions between their
husbands on the subject of alternatives In that distant day
homoeopathy and allopathy and hydropathy and all the opathies were
nearly unknown but men could wrangle and abuse each other on medical
points just as well and as bitterly then as they do now Religion
too quite as often failed to bear its proper fruits in 1793 as it
proves barren in these our own times On this subject of religion we
have one word to say and that is simply that it never was a meet
matter for selfgratulation and boasting Here we have the
AmericoAnglican church just as it has finished a blast of trumpets
through the medium of numberless periodicals and a thousand letters from
its confiding if not confident clergy in honour of its quiet and
harmony and superior polity suspended on the very brink of the
precipice of separation if not of schism and all because it has
pleased certain ultrasublimated divines in the other hemisphere to
write a parcel of tracts that nobody understands themselves included
How many even of the ministers of the altar fall at the very moment
they are beginning to fancy themselves saints and are ready to thank
God they are not like the publicans
Both Mrs Woolston and Mrs Yardley were what is called pious that
is each said her prayers each went to her particular church and very
particular churches they were each fancied she had a sufficiency of
saving faith but neither was charitable enough to think in a very
friendly temper of the other This difference of religious opinion
added to the rival reputations of their husbands made these ladies
anything but good neighbours and as has been intimated years had
passed since either had entered the door of the other
Very different was the feeling of the children Anne Woolston the
oldest sister of Mark and Bridget Yardley were nearly of an age and
they were not only schoolmates but fast friends To give their mothers
their due they did not lessen this intimacy by hints or intimations of
any sort but let the girls obey their own tastes as if satisfied it
was quite sufficient for professors of religion to hate in their own
persons without entailing the feeling on posterity Anne and Bridget
consequently became warm friends the two sweet pretty young things
both believing in the simplicity of their hearts that the very
circumstance which in truth caused the alienation not to say the
hostility of the elder members of their respective families viz
professional identity was an additional reason why they should love
each other so much the more The girls were about two and three years
the juniors of Mark but well grown for their time of life and frank
and affectionate as innocence and warm hearts could make them Each was
more than pretty though it was in styles so very different as
scarcely to produce any of that other sort of rivalry which is so apt
to occur even in the gentler sex Anne had bloom and features and fine
teeth and a charm that is so very common in America a good mouth but
Bridget had all these added to expression Nothing could be more soft
gentle and feminine than Bridget Yardleys countenance in its ordinary
state of rest or more spirited laughing buoyant or pitying than it
became as the different passions or feelings were excited in her young
bosom As Mark was often sent to see his sister home in her frequent
visits to the madams house where the two girls held most of their
intercourse he was naturally enough admitted into their association
The connection commenced by Marks agreeing to be Bridgets brother as
well as Annes This was generous at least for Bridget was an only
child and it was no more than right to repair the wrongs of fortune in
this particular The charming young thing declared that she would
rather have Mark Woolston for her brother than any other boy in
Bristol and that it was delightful to have the same person for a
brother as Anne Notwithstanding this flight in the romantic Bridget
Yardley was as natural as it was possible for a female in a reasonably
civilized condition of society to be There was a vast deal of
excellent feminine selfdevotion in her temperament but not a particle
of the exaggerated in either sentiment or fueling True as steel in all
her impulses and opinions in adopting Mark for a brother she merely
yielded to a strong natural sympathy without understanding its tendency
or its origin She would talk by the hour with Anne touching their
brother and what they must make him do and where he must go with them
and in what they could oblige him most The real sister was less active
than her friend in mind and body and she listened to all these schemes
and notions with a quiet submission that was not entirely free from
wonder
The result of all this intercourse was to awaken a feeling between Mark
and Bridget that was far more profound than might have been thought in
breasts so young and which coloured their future lives Mark first
became conscious of the strength of this feeling when he lost sight of
the Capes and fancied the dear little Bucks county girl he had left
behind him talking with his sister of his own absence and risks But
Mark had too much of the true spirit of a sailor in him to pine or
neglect his duty and long ere the ship had doubled the Cape of Good
Hope he had become an active and handy lad aloft When the ship reached
the China seas he actually took his trick at the helm
As was usual in that day the voyage of the Rancocus lasted about a
twelvemonth If John Chinaman were only onehalf as active as Jonathan
Restless it might be disposed of in about onefourth less time but
teas are not transported along the canals of the Celestial Empire with
anything like the rapidity with which wheat was sent to market over the
rough roads of the Great Republic in the age of which we are writing
When Mark Woolston reappeared in Bristol after the arrival of the
Rancocus below had been known there about twentyfour hours he was the
envy of all the lads in the place and the admiration of most of the
girls There he was a tall straight active wellmade wellgrown and
decidedly handsome lad of seventeen who had doubled the Cape of Good
Hope seen foreign parts and had a real India handkerchief hanging out
of each pocket of a blue roundabout of superfine cloth besides one
around his halfopen wellformed throat that was carelessly tied in a
true sailor knot The questions he had to answer and did answer
about whales Chinese feet and mountain waves Although Bristol lies
on a navigable river up and down which frigates had actually been seen
to pass in the revolution it was but little that its people knew of the
ocean Most of the worthy inhabitants of the place actually fancied that
the waves of the sea were as high as mountains though their notions of
the last were not very precise there being no elevations in that part
of the country fit even for a windmill
But Mark cared little for these interrogatories He was happy happy
enough at being the object of so much attention happier still in the
bosom of a family of which he had always been the favourite and was now
the pride and happiest of all when he half ravished a kiss from the
blushing cheek of Bridget Yardley Twelve months had done a great deal
for each of the young couple If they had not quite made a man of Mark
they had made him manly and his soidisant sister wondered that any
one could be so much improved by a seafaring life As for Bridget
herself she was just bursting into young womanhood resembling the bud
as its leaves of green are opening to permit those of the deepest
rosecoloured tint to be seen before they expand into the fullblown
flower Mark was more than delighted he was fascinated and young as
they were the month he passed at home sufficed to enable him to tell
his passion and to obtain a halfready halftimid acceptance of the
offer of his hand All this time the parents of these very youthful
lovers were as profoundly ignorant of what was going on as their
children were unobservant of the height to which professional
competition had carried hostilities between their respective parents
Doctors Woolston and Yardley no longer met even in consultations or if
they did meet in the house of some patient whose patronage was of too
much value to be slighted it was only to dispute and sometimes
absolutely to quarrel
At the end of one short month however Mark was once more summoned to
his post on board the Rancocus temporarily putting an end to his
delightful interviews with Bridget The lovers had made Anne their
confidant and she wellmeaning girl seeing no sufficient reason why
the son of one respectable physician should not be a suitable match for
the daughter of another respectable physician encouraged them in their
vows of constancy and pledges to become man and wife at a future but
an early day To some persons all this may seem exceedingly improper as
well as extremely precocious but the truth compels us to say that its
impropriety was by no means as obvious as its precocity The latter it
certainly was though Mark had shot up early and was a man at a time of
life when lads in less genial climates scarcely get tails to their
coats but its impropriety must evidently be measured by the habits of
the state of society in which the parties were brought up and by the
duties that had been inculcated In America then as now but little
heed was taken by parents more especially in what may be called the
middle classes concerning the connections thus formed by their
children So Long as the parties were moral bore good characters had
nothing particular against them and were of something near the same
social station little else was asked for or if more were actually
required it was usually when it was too late and after the young
people had got themselves too deeply in love to allow ordinary
prudential reasons to have their due force
Mark went to sea this time dragging after him a lengthening chain
but nevertheless filled with hope His years forbade much despondency
and while he remained as constant as if he had been a nextdoor
neighbour he was buoyant and the life of the whole crew after the
first week out This voyage was not direct to Canton like the first
but the ship took a cargo of sugar to Amsterdam and thence went to
London where she got a freight for Cadiz The war of the French
Revolution was now blazing in all the heat of its first fires and
American bottoms were obtaining a large portion of the carrying trade of
the world Captain Crutchely had orders to keep the ship in Europe
making the most of her until a certain sum in Spanish dollars could be
collected when he was to fill up with provisions and water and again
make the best of his way to Canton In obeying these instructions he
went from port to port and as a sort of consequence of having Quaker
owners turning his peaceful character to great profit thus giving Mark
many opportunities of seeing as much of what is called the world as can
be found in seaports Great indeed is the difference between places
that are merely the marts of commerce and those that are really
political capitals of large countries No one can be aware of or can
fully appreciate the many points of difference that in reality exist
between such places who has not seen each and that sufficiently near
to be familiar with both Some places of which London is the most
remarkable example enjoy both characters and when this occurs the
town gels to possess a tone that is even less provincial and narrow if
possible than that which is to be found in a place that merely rejoices
in a court This it is which renders Naples insignificant as its
commerce comparatively is superior to Vienna and Genoa to Florence
While it would be folly to pretend that Mark in his situation obtained
the most accurate notions imaginable of all he saw and heard in his
visits to Amsterdam London Cadiz Bordeaux Marseilles Leghorn
Gibraltar and two or three other ports that might be mentioned and to
which he went he did glean a good deal some of which was useful to him
in afterlife He lost no small portion of the provincial rust of home
moreover and began to understand the vast difference between seeing
the world and going to meeting and going to mill3 In addition to
these advantages Mark was transferred from the forecastle to the cabin
before the ship sailed for Canton The practice of near two years had
made him a very tolerable sailor and his previous education made the
study of navigation easy to him In that day there was a scarcity of
officers in America and a young man of Marks advantages physical and
moral was certain to get on rapidly provided he only behaved well It
is not at all surprising therefore that our young sailor got to be the
secondmate of the Raucocus before he had quite completed his eighteenth
year
Footnote 3 This last phrase has often caused the writer to smile
when he has heard a countryman say with a satisfied air as is so
often the case in this good republic that such or such a thing
here is good enough for me meaning that he questions if there
be anything of the sort that is better anywhere else It was
uttered many years since by a shrewd Quaker in WestChester who
was contending with a neighbour on a subject that the other
endeavoured to defend by alluding to the extent of his own
observation Oh yes Josy answered the Friend thees been to
meeting and thees been to mill and thee knows all about it
America is full of travellers who have been to meeting and who have
been to mill This it is which makes it unnecessarily provincial
The voyage from London to Canton and thence home to Philadelphia
consumed about ten months The Rancocus was a fast vessel but she could
not impart her speed to the Chinamen It followed that Mark wanted but a
few weeks of being nineteen years old the day his ship passed Cape May
and what was more he had the promise of Captain Crutchely of sailing
with him as his first officer in the next voyage With that promise in
his mind Mark hastened up the river to Bristol as soon as he was clear
of the vessel
Bridget Yardley had now fairly budded to pursue the figure with which
we commenced the description of this blooming flower and if not
actually expanded into perfect womanhood was so near it as to show
beyond all question that the promises of her childhood were to be very
amply redeemed Mark found her in black however or in mourning for
her mother An only child this serious loss had thrown her more than
ever in the way of Anne the parents on both sides winking at an
association that could do no harm and which might prove so useful It
was very different however with the young sailor He had not been a
fortnight at home and getting to be intimate with the rooftree of
Doctor Yardley before that person saw fit to pick a quarrel with him
and to forbid him his house As the dispute was wholly gratuitous on the
part of the Doctor Mark behaving with perfect propriety on the
occasion it may be well to explain its real cause The fact was that
Bridget was an heiress if not on a very large scale still an heiress
and what was more unalterably so in right of her mother and the
thought that a son of his competitor Doctor Woolston should profit by
this fact was utterly insupportable to him Accordingly he quarrelled
with Mark the instant he was apprised of the character of his
attentions and forbade him the house To do Mark justice he knew
nothing of Bridgets worldly possessions That she was beautiful and
warmhearted and frank and sweettempered and feminine and
affectionate he both saw and felt but beyond this he neither saw
anything nor cared about seeing anything The young sailor was as
profoundly ignorant that Bridget was the actual owner of certain three
per cents that brought twelve hundred a year as if she did not own a
copper as it was the fashion of that period to saycents being
then very little if at all used Nor did he know anything of the farm
she had inherited from her mother or of the store in town that brought
three hundred and fifty more in rent It is true that some allusions
