ALTON OF SOMASCO
CHAPTER I
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
It was snowing slowly and persistently as it had done all day when
Henry Alton of Somasco ranch stood struggling with a halftamed Cayuse
pony in a British Columbian settlement  The Cayuse had laid its ears
back and was describing a circle round him scattering mud and snow
while the man who gripped the bridle in a lean brown hand watched it
without impatience admiringly
Game he said  I like them that way  Still it isnt every man
could seize a pack on him and youll have to let up three dollars on
the price you asked me
Now three dollars is a considerable proportion of the value of an
Indian pony fresh from the northern grass lands with the devil that
lurks in most of his race still unsubdued within him but the rancher
who owned him did not immediately reject the offer  Possibly he was
not especially anxious to keep the beast
Oh yes said a bystander  Hes game enough and Id ask the boys
to my funeral if I meant to drive him at night over the lake trail
After being most kicked into woodpulp Carter hasnt any more use for
him and Ill lay you a dollar Alton you and your partner cant put
the pack on him
Perhaps the Cayuse was tired or desirous of watching for an
opportunity for it came to a standstill snorting with its wicked
eyes upon the man who laughed a little and shoved back the broad hat
from his forehead as he straightened himself  The laugh rang
pleasantly and the faint twinkle in Altons eyes was in keeping with
it  They were grey and steady when the light sank out of them and
the rest of the bronzed face was shrewd and quietly masterful  He wore
a deerskin jacket fancifully embroidered blue canvas overalls and gum
boots to the knee while though all of them needed repair the attire
was picturesque and showed its wearers lean symmetry  The mans age
was apparently twentyfive and eight years use of the axe had set a
stamp of springy suppleness upon him  He had also wrested rather more
than a livelihood from the Canadian forest during them
All round him the loghouses rose in all their unadorned dinginess
beneath the sombre pines and the largest of them bore a straggling
legend announcing that it was Hortons store and hotel  A mixed
company of bush ranchers free prospectors axemen and miners lounged
outside it in picturesque disarray and high above rose a dim white
line of nevermelting snow
Well said Alton its time this circus was over anyway and if
Carter will take my bid Ill clinch that deal with you  Have the pack
and seizings handy Charley
The rancher nodded and Alton got a tighter grip on the bridle  Then
the Cayuse rose upright with forehoofs lifted and the mans arm was
drawn back to strike  The hoofs came down harmlessly but the fist got
home and for a moment or two there was a swaying and plunging of man
and beast amidst the hurledup snow  Then the Cayuse was borne
backwards until the vicinity of the hotel verandah left no room for
kicking and another man hastily flung a rope round the bundles he
piled upon its back  He was also tolerably capable and in another
minute the struggle was over  The Cayuses attitude expressed
indignant astonishment while Alton stood up breathless with his
knuckles bleeding
Ill trouble you for that dollar and Ill keep him now he said
Can you wait until I come down next week Carter
Oh yes said the rancher  Your promise is good enough for a year
or two
The speaker was a sinewy bushman in curiously patched overalls with a
bronzed and honest face and he turned aside with a little gesture of
dislike when a man of a very different stamp pushed by him  The
latter wore a black felt hat and a great furlined coat while his face
was pale and fleshy and his eyes were cunning  His appearance
suggested prosperity and a life of indulgence in the cities and when
he stopped in front of Alton the latter would have lost little by any
comparison between the pair  The pose of his sinewy figure and the
clear brownness of his skin spoke of arduous labour sound sleep and
the vigour that comes from a healthful occupation  The steady
directness of his gaze and quiet immobility of his face also conveyed
an indefinite suggestion of power and endurance and there was a
curious grace in his movements when he turned courteously towards the
stranger
You soon fixed him packer said the city man
Alton laughed  The boys mostly call me rancher said he  Still it
dont count for much and I do some packing occasionally
Thats all right said the stranger sharply for there was something
in Altons answer which made him inclined to assert his dignity
Everybody seems to be a rancher hereaway and you maynt be too proud
to put through a job for me
Alton nodded and glanced at the speaker questioningly
No  If it would fit in he said
Im Hallam said the other man  Hallam and Vose of the Tyee
mineral claim  Theyve been fooling things up yonder big pumps given
out and Ive a few hundred pounds of engine fixings back at the
railroad I want brought in by tomorrow
Alton glanced at the packbeasts waiting unloaded outside the store
and shook his head  Im sorry I cant trade with you he said  You
see Ive promised another man to pack up some stores for him
Hallam made a gesture of impatience  Then you can let him wait he
said  This deal will pay you better  You can put your own price on
it
Altons eyelids came down a little and the stranger seemed to find his
glance disconcerting  You dont seem to understand  I promised the
other man to bring up his things he said
Well said Hallam come along into the shanty yonder and have a
drink with me  We may fix up some way of getting over the difficulty
Sorry said Alton with a suspicious quietness  I dont drink much
anyway and then only with the boys who know me
Hey said Hallam  You are talking like a condemned Englishman
I cant help that said Alton  I am a Canadian but if you want
another reason it wouldnt suit me to drink with you anyway  You
see you didnt do the square thing with one or two friends of mine who
worked on the Tyee
He turned on his heel and Hallam who was a man of some importance in
the cities gasped with astonishment and indignation
What is that fellow he said
The man laughed and answered him in the bushmans slowest drawl  You
dont know much or you wouldnt ask said he  Hes Alton of
Somasco but if he lives long enough he will be one of the biggest men
in this country
Hallam said nothing but there was a curious look in his face which
puzzled the rancher  It suggested that he had heard of Alton and
something more
Meanwhile Alton entered the store where the man who kept it pointed to
a litter of packages strewn about the floor and sundry bags upon the
counter
Thats Townsheads lot and those are Thomsons things he said and
turned aside to listen to a rancher who came in smiling
Alton took up a big cotton bag marked Townshead tossed it aloft and
caught it and then shook his head dubiously  Thats rather too light
for ten pounds  You want to try her on the scales again he said
The storekeeper who was also a magistrate grinned goodhumouredly
Its good enough for the money anyway said he  But whats the
matter with the Tyee dollars Harry that you wouldnt do Hallams
packing
Alton glanced at him gravely  I think not said he  Put another
pound or two into her and Ill pay you on your invoice for the last
lot you sent me  Otherwise Im going to whittle down that bill
considerably  You see Townshead is too shaky to come down and he
cant live on nothing
And the Lord knows when hell pay you said the storekeeper  Its a
good twelve months since he sent a dollar to me
Alton laughed a little  I can wait he said  Fill that bag up
again  Get hold of the truck Charley
Charles Seaforth who was apparently younger and certainly a trifle
more fastidious about his attire than his comrade shouldered a flour
bag and twenty minutes later he and Alton tramped out of the
settlement with three loaded beasts splashing and floundering in front
of them  It was almost dark now though a line of snow still glimmered
white and cold high up beyond the trees until the trail plunged into
the blackness of the forest  Then the lights of the settlement were
blotted out behind them the hum of voices ceased and they were alone
in the primeval silence of the bush  The thud and splash of tired
hoofs only served to emphasize it the thin jingle of steel or creak of
packrope was swallowed up and lost for the great dim forest seemed to
mock at anything man could do to disturb its pristine serenity  It had
shrouded all that valley where no biting gale ever blew from the
beginning majestic in its solitary grandeur and eternally green  Pine
and hemlock balsam and cedar had followed in due succession others
that had grown to the fulness of their stature only in centuries and
their healing essence which brings sound sleep to mans jaded body and
tranquillity to his mind had doubtless risen like incense when all was
made very good
Now Alton loved the wilderness partly because he had been born in it
and because he had a large share of the spirit of his race  He had
also seen the cities and they did not greatly please him though he
had watched their inhabitants curiously and been taught a good deal
about them by what he read in books which to the wonder of his
associates he would spend hardlyearned dollars upon  It was more
curious that he understood all he read and sometimes more than the
writer apparently did for Alton was not only the son of a clever man
but had seen Nature in her primitive nakedness and the human passions
that usually lie beneath the surface for man reverts a little and the
veneer of his civilization wears through in the silent bush
Thus he plodded on contentedly on his twelvemile march with the snow
and the mire beneath it reaching now and then to his knee until his
companion stopped beside a little bark shanty and lighted a lantern
Thomsons dumpingplace already he said pulling a burst cotton bag
out of the sack of sundries upon the Cayuse ponys back  Some of it
has got out and Jimmy was always particular about the weight of his
sugar  Well the rest of it must be in the bottom somewhere and if
youll hold the sack up Ill shake it into my hat
Altons hat was capacious and he had worn it during the two years
which had elapsed since his last visit to Vancouver but it did not
seem to occur to him that it was in any way an unusual receptacle for
sugar  His companion however laughed a little as he stirred the
sticky mass round with his wet fingers
There is no use giving him our tobacco and matches in said he
Here are the letters Mrs Neilson gave me at the postoffice too
Alton took the letters and his face grew a trifle grim under the
flickering light of the lantern as he thrust them crumpled into his
pocket  From England and they will keep he said  Theres nobody
Im anxious to hear from in that country  Now well go on again
Charley
The Cayuse however objected and there was a struggle before Alton
convinced it that resistance would be useless while presently the
trail grew steeper and the roar of water came out of the darkness
before them
This said Alton gravely is a great country but its mighty
unfinished yet and it kind of hurts me to see all that power wasted
Wasted said Seaforth smiling  Dont the salmon swim in it and
the bear and deer come down to drink
Oh yes said Alton  And sometimes the Siwash wash themselves in it
too but thats not the question  This earth wasnt made for the bear
and deer and theyve thousands of poor folks they cant find a use for
back there in the old country  Isnt that so Charley
Seaforth who was a young Englishman of good upbringing laughed  I
have no reason for doubting it said he  In any case none of my
worthy relations had any use for me  Still I dont see the connection
exactly
No said Alton  Well its simple  We have the gold and silver
and the coal and iron too while it dont strike one that these
forests were put here just to look pretty
The metals you allude to take some trouble in getting out said
Seaforth dryly
Alton nodded  Of course he said  Thats what man got his brains
for and the one difference between a white man and a Siwash is that
hes always striking for something better
Seaforth laughed  You are trying to get at something as usual said
he
Yes said Alton gravely  I generally am  Well I can see what we
dont want of these forests sailing sawn up to China and this river
sprinkled with sawmills and woodpulp factories  Then I can hear the
big dynamoes humming and the thump of the mine stamps run with the
current the men who put them down will get for nothing  What were
wasting round Somasco is going to feed ten thousand people by and by
Its a big idea said Seaforth reflectively  Still I dont know
that if it were ever put through the place would look any prettierand
the question is whos going to set the whole thing running
God knows said Alton gravely  But somebody will and if I live
long enough Ill make a shot at it  Oh yes its very pretty as it
is but the greatest thing in this world is man and it was made as it
is for him to master
You have curious notions for a Canadian bush rancher said Seaforth
You are however really an Englishman arent you
No said Alton grimly  My father used to be but he was too much of
my way of thinking and they fired him out of the country  Its a thing
I dont like to talk of Charley and just now Im a lowdown packer
hauling in a pile of truck Ill never get paid for  Steady come up
Theres nothing going to hurt you Julius Caesar
The snarling and spitting of a panther came out of the darkness and it
was only by main force Alton dragged the Cayuse past  Then he laughed
a little  Its a pity we didnt bring a rifle along he said
Panthers must have been made for something or they wouldnt be here
but its a beast a white man has no kind of use for
It was an hour later and snowing fast when they climbed out of the
valley and floundered over shale and slippery rock amidst scattered
pines to the forking of the trail  One arm of it dipped again and
wound through a deep sheltered hollow to the Somasco ranch the other
ran straight along the hillside to Townsheads dwelling  The hillside
was also steep the beasts were tired and the trail was very bad
Seaforth glanced at his comrade when they stopped a moment and saw him
dimly tugging at the Cayuses bridle through the snow
Its a long way to Townsheads  Still I think we can make it out
he said
Alton laughed  We have got to  Theres not generally too much to eat
at that house and theyll want the things he said
There was another struggle with the Cayuse which appeared reluctant to
face a treacherous ascent whose slope was somewhat steeper than the
pitch of an average roof but once more Alton conquered and they
dragged the beasts up and then floundered on doggedly beside them
seeing nothing but a dim pine or two through the snow  Now and then
there was a rattle and a rush beneath them followed by a faint splash
and Seaforth shivered a little knowing that the shingle they dislodged
had plunged into a lonely lake lying far below  Still Alton said
nothing but floundered on apparently as cheerfully as though he would
be well paid for the risk he ran until he crawled down into the
sliding whiteness when a hide strip burst and some of Townsheads
packages were scattered about the face of a precipitous declivity
Seaforth held his breath a moment as gripping the bridle of a
trembling beast he watched him until the dim moving figure sank into
the snow  He could hear the wash of the unfrozen lake and knew there
was no foothold on the slippery rock which sloped almost sheer to it
through the darkness close beneath  Then a voice came up Wasnt
there a dry goods package of some kind Charley
There was shouted Seaforth  But come up with what youve got and
leave it
A faint laugh answered him and through the moaning of the pines he
caught the words If its not over the edge here Im going to get the
thing
Seaforth said nothing further  He knew his comrade too well and could
picture him clinging by hand and heel as he crawled along the brink of
the declivity with the lake below and gasped from relief when once
more a dim whitened object lurched up out of the snow
Got them all said Alton cheerfully  That last one was just on the
edge and it took some thinking before I could get at it  Still I
guessed it was some kind of dress stuff for the girl and if we lost it
it might be a long while before she got another
They relashed the packages and went on again floundering through
steadily deepening snow until once more the roar of water met them as
they dipped into a hollow  It grew louder rapidly and presently Alton
pulled the Cayuse up on the brink of a river  It came down frothing
out of a haze of sliding snow tumbling with a hoarse growl about the
great dim boulders whirled and tossed in a white confusion down the
wild race of a rapid and was lost again  How far the other bank was
there was nothing to show for even the scattered pines behind the men
were hidden now and Seaforth stared at the tumult of froth before him
very dubiously
Shes pretty full tonight he said  It has got to be attempted
but Im not quite sure how were going through
Alton laughed a little and brought his hand down on the Cayuse ponys
flank  Well if youll come along behind me you will see said he
Seaforth was waistdeep next minute and the water was horribly cold
Then he was washed against a boulder and fancied that one of the
packbeasts kicked him in its floundering  In any case one knee seemed
to grow suddenly useless but he was not very sure of anything just
then for a burst of spray filled his eyes and the bottom appeared to
slip from under him  He found foothold again in a moment or two and
dimly saw Altons head and shoulders above the back of a plunging
beast while another was apparently swimming somewhere between them
Then the one Seaforth led stumbled and they went away down stream
together clawing for a foothold with the shingle slipping under them
until there was a thud as they brought up against another boulder  As
he was not sensible of any especially painful blow Seaforth decided
that it was the pony which had struck the rock and had just come to
this decision when his feet were swept from under him and still
clinging to the bridle he was pressed against the stone while the
river frothed and roared about him
Once more he felt that it was horribly cold and flung a wet arm about
the rock but the power seemed to go out of him and he wondered
vacantly whether the pony would be able to extricate itself and him
It floundered spasmodically for a while and then lay still  How long
this continued Seaforth did not know but it was more than twelve hours
since he had left Somasco and he had plodded up and down steep
hillsides over rock and boulder and through deep mire and snow most
of the time while there are limits to the domination the will of any
man may exercise over his wornout body
Seaforth had commenced to realize still with a curious absence of
concern which was possibly the result of cold and fatigue that as the
pony could not help him it might be too late very soon unless he made a
vigorous effort to help himself when he heard a shout and something
came slowly through the sliding whiteness in his direction  Then there
was another shout and when somebody dragged the pony clear of the
boulder he held on by the bridle and went floundering waistdeep up
stream  The water however now sank rapidly and soon he was clear of
it to the knee  Then there was a clatter of hoofs on slippery rock
and he lurched dripping and gasping into the partial shelter of the
pines  Somebody smote him on the shoulder and he heard Altons voice
Get hold and hustle  Well fetch Townsheads in an hour or so
CHAPTER II
AT TOWNSHEADS RANCH
It was chilly and damp in the logwalled livingroom of the Townshead
homestead which stood far up in a lonely valley amidst the scattered
pines  The room was also bare and somewhat comfortless for the land
was too poor to furnish its possessor with more than necessities and
Townshead not the man to improve it much  He lay in an old leather
chair beside the stove a slender greyhaired man with the worn look
of one whose burden had been too heavy for him  His face was thin and
somewhat haggard his long slender hand rather that of an artist than
a bush rancher and his threadbare attire was curiously neat  He wore
among other somewhat unusual things an old red velvet jacket and there
was a little cup of black coffee and a single cigar of exceptional
quality on the table beside him
Townshead was in fact somewhat of an anachronism in a country whose
inhabitants exhibit at least a trace of primitive and wholesome
barbarity  One could have fancied him at home among men of leisure and
cultivated tastes but he seemed out of place in a logbuilt ranch in
the snowwrapped wilderness swept by the bitter wind  Perhaps he
realized it for his voice was querulous as he said I wonder if you
have forgotten Nellie that we were sitting warm and safe in England
five years ago tonight
Nellie Townshead looked up quickly over her sewing from the other side
of the stove and for a moment there was something akin to pain in her
eyes  They were clear brown eyes and it was characteristic that they
almost immediately brightened into a smile for while the girls face
resembled her fathers in its refinement there was courage in it in
place of weariness
I am afraid I do though I try not to and am generally able she
said
Townshead sighed  The young are fortunate for they can forget he
said  Even that small compensation is however denied to me while
the man I called my friend is living in luxury on what was yours and
mine  Had it been any one but Charters I might have borne it better
but it was the one man I had faith in who sent us out here to penury
Townshead was wrong in one respect for it was the weakness of an
oversensitive temperament which while friends were ready to help him
had driven him to hide himself in Western Canada when as the result of
unwise speculations financial disaster overtook him  His daughter
however did not remind him of this as some daughters would have done
though she understood it well enough and a memory out of keeping with
the patter of the snow and moaning of the wind rose up before her as
she looked into the twinkling stove  She could recall that night five
years ago very well for she had spent most of it amidst lights and
music as fresh and bright herself as the flowers that nestled against
her first ball dress  It was a night of triumph and revelation in
which she had first felt the full power of her beauty and her sex and
she had returned with the glamour of it all upon her to find her father
sitting with his head in his hands at a table littered with business
papers  His face had frightened her and it had never wholly lost the
look she saw upon it then for Townshead was lacking in fibre and had
found that a fondness for horses and some experience of amateur
cattlebreeding on a small and expensive scale was a very poor
preparation for the grim reality of ranching in Western Canada
Presently his daughter brushed the memories from her and stood
smiling at the man straight and willowy in her faded cotton dress with
a partly finished garment in her hands which frost and sun had not
wholly turned rough and red
Your coffee will be getting cold  Shall I put it on the stove she
said
Townshead made a little grimace  One may as well describe things
correctly and that is chickory he said  Still you may warm it if
it pleases you but I might point out that indifferent as it is
preserved milk which has gone musty does not improve its flavour
The girl laughed a little though there was something more pathetic
than heartsome in her merriment  I am afraid we shall have none
tomorrow unless Mr Seaforth gets through she said  I suppose you
have not a few dollars you could give me father
No said Townshead with somewhat unusual decisiveness I have not
You are always asking for dollars  What do you want them for
Mr Seaforth has packed our stores in for a long while and we have
paid him nothing said the girl while a little colour crept into her
face
Townshead made a gesture of weariness  The young man seems willing to
do it out of friendship for us and I see no reason why we should not
allow him unless he presumes upon the trifling service he said  To
do him justice however he and his comrade have always shown
commendable taste
The girl smiled a little for considering their relative positions in a
country where a man takes his station according to his usefulness the
word presume appeared incongruous  Still I should prefer not to be
in their debt she said
Then we will free ourselves of the obligation with the next remittance
Jack sends in said Townshead impatiently
The girls face grew troubled  I am afraid that will not be for some
little time she said  Poor Jack  You surely remember he is lying
ill
It is especially inconvenient just now said Townshead querulously
It has also been a sore point with me that a son of mine should hire
himself out as a labourer  I am sorry I let him go the more so
because the work upon the ranch is getting too much for me
Nellie Townshead said nothing though she sighed as she pictured the
young lad who had been stricken by rheumatic fever as a result of
toiling waistdeep in icy water lying uncared for in the mining camp
amidst the snows of Caribou  She did not however remind her father
that it was she who had in the meanwhile done most of the indispensable
work upon the ranch and Townshead would not in any case have believed
her for he had a fine capacity for deceiving himself
In place of it she spread out some masculine garments about the stove
and coloured a trifle when her father glanced at her inquiringly  The
creek must be running high and Mr Alton and his partner will be very
wet she said  I am warming a few of Jacks old things for them
They cannot go back to Somasco tonight you know
I confess that it did not occur to me said Townshead languidly
No I suppose one could scarcely expect them to and we shall have to
endure their company
A faint sparkle that had nothing to do with laughter crept into the
girls eyes for there were times when her father tried her patience
I wonder if it occurred to you that we shall probably starve tomorrow
unless Mr Alton who is apparently not to be paid for it makes what
must be a very arduous march tonight she said
Im afraid it did not said Townshead with a fine unconcern  I
think you understand my dear that I leave the commissariat to you
and you have a way of putting things which jars upon one occasionally
A little trace of colour crept into the girls cheek but it faded
again as she sat down beside the stove  Still now and then she
pricked her fingers with the needle which she had not done before and
finally laid down the fabric and laughed softly  There is she said
something distinctly humorous in the whole position
You said her father had always a somewhat peculiar sense of
humour
Well said his daughter with a slight quiver of her lips I feel
that I must either cry or laugh tonight  Do you know there is
scarcely enough for breakfast in the house and that I am dreadfully
hungry now
Townshead glanced at her reproachfully  Either one or the other would
be equally distasteful to me he said
The girl sighed and turned away to thrust a few small billets into the
stove  She chose them carefully for the big box whose ugliness she
had hidden by a strip of cheap printed cotton was almost empty  The
hired man seeing no prospect of receiving his wages had departed
after a stormy interview and shortly after his son followed him
Townshead discovered that sawing wood was especially unsuited to his
constitution  Then the girl increased the draught a little and
endeavoured to repress a shiver  The house was damp for want of proper
packing and the cold wind that came down from the high peaks moaned
about it eerily  It was also very lonely and the girl who was young
felt a great longing for human fellowship
Her father presently took up a book and there was silence only broken
by the rattle of loose shingles overhead and the soft thud against the
windows of driving snow while the girl sat dreaming over her sewing of
the brighter days in faroff England which had slipped away from her
for ever  Five years was not a very long time but during it her
English friends had forgotten her and one who had scarcely left her
side that memorable night had though she read of the doings of his
regiment now and then sent her no word or token  A little flush crept
into her cheek as remembering certain words of his she glanced at her
reddened wrists and little toilhardened hands  She who had been a
highspirited girl with the world at her feet then was now one of the
obscure toilers whose work was never done  Still because it was only
on rare occasions that work left her leisure to think about herself it
had not occurred to her that she had lost but little by the change
The hands that had once been soft and white were now firm and brown
the stillness of the great firs and cedars had given her a calm
tranquillity in place of restless haste and frost and sun the clear
warmtinted complexion while a look of strength and patience had
replaced the laughter in her hazel eyes
Suddenly however there was a trampling in the snow and a sound of
voices followed after an interval by a knocking at the door  It
swung open and two whitened objects loaded with bags and packages
strode into the room  The blast that came in with them set the lamp
flickering and sent a chill through the girl but she rose with a
