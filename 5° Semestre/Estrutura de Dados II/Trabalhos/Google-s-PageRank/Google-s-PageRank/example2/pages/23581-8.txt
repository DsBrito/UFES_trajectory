INTRODUCTION
Any ordinary active man provided he has reasonably good eyesight and
nerve can fly and fly well If he has nerve enough to drive an
automobile through the streets of a large city and perhaps argue with
a policeman on the question of speed limits he can take himself off
the ground in an airplane and also landa thing vastly more
difficult and dangerous We hear a great deal about special tests for
the fliervacuumchambers spinningchairs coordination
teststhere need be none of these The average man in the street the
clerk the laborer the mechanic the salesman with proper training
and interest can be made good if not highly proficient pilots If
there may be one deduction drawn from the experience of instructors in
the Royal Air Force it is that it is the training not the
individual that makes the pilot
Education is not the prime requisite Good common sense and judgment
are much more valuable Above all a sense of touch such as a man
can acquire playing the piano swinging a pick riding a bicycle
driving an automobile or playing tennis is important A man should
not be too sensitive to loss of balance nor should he be lacking in a
sense of balance There are people who cannot sail a sailboat or ride
a bicyclethese people have no place in the air But ninetynine out
of one hundred men the ordinary normal men can learn to fly This
has been the experience of the Royal Air Force in Canada
There will be as much difference between the civilian pilot the man
who owns an airplane of the future and drives it himself and the army
flier as there is now between the man who drives his car on Sunday
afternoons over country roads and the racing driver who is striving
for new records on specially built tracks If aeronautics is to be
made popular every one must be able to take part in it It must cease
to be a highly specialized business It must be put on a basis where
the ordinary person can snap the flying wires of a machine listen to
their twang and know them to be true just as any one now thumps his
rear tire to see whether it is properly inflated
The book in a large sense a labor of love is the collaboration of
an American officer of the United States Air Service and another
American a flyingofficer in the Royal Air Force If the Royal Air
Force way of doing things seems to crowd itself to the fore in the
discussion of the training of pilots the authors crave indulgence
In a subject which lends itself dangerously to imagination the
authors have endeavored to base what they have written not on
prophecy but on actual accomplishments to date The latter are indeed
so solid that there is no necessity for guesswork Aviation has proved
itself beyond peradventure to those who have followed it but up to
the present the general public has not sufficiently analyzed its
demonstrated possibilities
The era of the air is undoubtedly at hand it now remains to take the
steps necessary to reap full advantages from it

WARS CONQUEST OF THE AIR
The World War opened to man the freedom of the skies Amid all its
anguish and suffering has come forth the conquest of the air
Scientists manufacturers dreamers and the most hardheaded of men
have united under the goad of its necessity to sweep away in a series
of supreme efforts all the fears and doubts which had chained men to
earth
True years before in fact nearly a decade before the Wright
brothers had risen from the ground and flown about through the air in
a machine which defied conventional rules and beliefs The world had
looked on in wonder and then dropped back into an apathetic
acceptance of the fact Despite the actual demonstration and the
field of imagination which was opened up these early flights proved
to be a worlds wonder only for a moment
For years aviation dragged on Daredevils and adventurers took it up
to make money by hairraising exploits at various meets and exhibits
Many died and the general public after satiating its lust for the
sensational turned its thought elsewhere Flight was regarded as
somewhat the plaything of those who cared not for life and as a
result the serious sober thought of the community did not enter into
its solution
Business men held aloof Apart from circus performances there seemed
no money to be made in aviation and consequently practically none was
invested in it What little manufacturing was done was by zealots and
inventors Workmanship was entirely by hand slow amateurish and
unreliable
Strangely enough scientists were equally apathetic It might have
been expected that their imaginations would be fired by the unexplored
realms of the air and by the incomparably new field of experiment
opened to them but they were not The great question that of flight
itself had been answered and but few were interested in working out
the less spectacular applications of its principles Aviation remained
very much of a poor sister in the scientific world held back by all
the discredit attaching to the early stuntflying and by failure to
break through the ancient belief in its impracticability for any
purposes other than the sensational
So the science limped along unsupported by either public interest or
capital Now and again some startling feat attracted the worlds
attention as when the English Channel was first crossed by air and
England was made to realize that her insularity was gone For a moment
this feat held public interest but again without a true realization
of its significance There seemed nothing which would drive man to
develop the gift which had been put within his reach
Up to that fatal moment in August 1914 when the World War broke out
aviation had made but little progress All nations had what passed as
air services but they were very small and illequipped and were
regarded with doubt and suspicion by the military leaders of the
various countries Compared with what has since taken place the
experiments previous to the war were only the most rudimentary
beginnings
Then came the war Mans imagination was aroused to a feverish desire
for the development of any device for causing destruction
Conventions usages and prejudices were laid aside and every
possibility of inflicting damage on the enemy was examined on its
merits Sentiment or any regard for personal danger involved was
thrown to the winds Science was mobilized in all lines in the
struggle to keep one step ahead of the enemy
Almost immediately aviation challenged the attention of the
responsible leaders The handful of French planes which in those early
fateful days of August penetrated up into Belgium brought back the
information of the German mobilization there and this led to the
rearrangement of French forces in preparation for the battle of the
Marne As a result aviation at once leaped into high repute for
scouting purposes and the foundations were laid for its great
development
But as aviation had proved itself in the warfare of movement leading
down to the Marne and sweeping back later to the Aisne so it proved
itself in the French warfare which was so unexpectedly to follow When
the two opposing lines were so close together that they locked almost
in a death grip each side kept such strict watch that ground
observation was greatly hampered Apparently there was only one way to
find out what was going on behind the enemys lines That was by
looking from above The first aviator therefore who sailed into the
air and spied the enemy introduced one of the most important
developments in the strategy of modern warfare
Thereupon began one of those silent battles of the rear of which we
see and hear so little but which indeed decides sometimes far in
advance of the actual test of battle just which side is going to win
Scientists inventors manufacturers and practical fliers began
coming together in increasing numbers to exact from this latest method
of warfare its last degree of usefulness In the studies and factories
on both sides of the lines men dedicated themselves to the solution of
the problem of flight
Stage by stage the difficulties were overcome First it was the
Germans who with their terrible Fokker planes harnessed the
machinegun to the airplane and made of it a weapon of offense Then
it was the Allies who added the radio and made of it an efficient
method of observation and spotting of artillery fire Increased
enginepower began to be developed and bombs were carried in
everincreasing numbers and size
The moment an enemy plane fell on either side of the line the victors
gathered about their prey with a keenness which could come only of the
hope that they might find in it some suggestion that would make their
own flying more efficient Each learned from the other so that the
different schools on either side of the line had all the advantage of
watching the development of their rivals Very shortly after an
improvement appeared on one side it reappeared in the planes of the
other side
It is doubtful if ever a more desperate scientific battle was fought
than that which featured the development of the air services of the
various belligerents during the war Control of the air was so vital
that neither could afford to overlook any possibility and as a
result the scientific evolution was truly astounding No man was
reserved on this subject of airplane improvement All contributed
their best skill and ability to the common reservoir of knowledge
Very soon mans conquest of the air became so complete that different
types of planes were developed for different kinds of work The plane
of the early days which wandered off by itself wherever it saw fit
gathered what information it could and returned to drop a note to the
commander below developed into a highly efficient twoseated plane
equipped with machineguns for protection against attack wireless for
sending back messages and cameras for photographing the enemys
positions below The plane which had earlier dropped an occasional
bomb in a hitormiss fashion over the side now developed either into
a powerful twoseater with a great weightcarrying capacity and a
continually more efficient scientific method of aiming its missiles or
into a huge machine for longdistance nightbombing work capable of
carrying from two to a dozen men and from two to four tons of bombs
During this time the strictly fighting plane usually a singleseater
increased in speed ceiling and agility till it could dart twist
and dive about three to five miles above the trenches protecting
friendly bombing and observation planes below from enemy attack or
swooping down to send enemy planes in flames to the ground
Vital though all this work was for the war it had an incomparably
greater value for the perpetual struggle which all mankind is waging
against nature While the various nations were seeking to destroy one
another through the air they were in reality destroying the chains
which bound them to the ground and winning their freedom in a new
element The advance which the Allies or the Germans made over each
other in scientific aerial development was a joint advance over the
restrictions of gravitation
This indeed apart from the spread of democracy and internationalism
may well stand out in history as the wars richest heritage Problems
which had been considered insoluble were solved The casting aside of
all conventions all restrictive habits of thought all selfishnesses
and the focusing of the highest scientific ability in a struggle which
might mean the life or death of the nation had brought as a
byproduct a development beyond our wildest fancies
Aerial operations in any future war however will have at once a
problem which has only recently and in very much smaller degree
confronted the navy namely the assurance of attack not only on the
front in the rear and on both flanks but from above and below as
well Recently the navy has had to face that problemsubmarines
operating below and airplanes above but the problem of attack upon a
ship is not so serious as upon an airplane
Already in order to meet this danger of attack from every possible
direction a most complete strategy and system of formations have been
worked out In this way the various types of planes operate in
different air strata according to their missions the upper planes
echelon somewhat behind those below on the order of a flight of steps
facing the enemy This system provides a quick method of reception of
an attack and the assurance of quick support no matter where the
attack may come Obviously there would be nothing in all of warfare on
either land or sea comparable to a collision between two such aerial
fleets The speed of the lighter planes quick lifetaking duels in
several different strata at once would provide a clash of action
speed and skill far more beautiful and yet in many ways far more
terrible than anything ever recorded in the history of war
Fleets of the skieswho shall attempt at this day of the infancy of
the science to limit their scope Aerial battleplanes of colossal
size and power are as certain to come in time and in not a very long
time as the dreadnought of today was certain to follow the first
armored ship of only a halfcentury ago Never yet has man opened up a
new avenue of war that he has not pursued it relentlessly to its final
conclusion It is certain that he will not fail to push aerial
development with all the energy with which he has devoted himself to
the science of destruction
The avenue of the seas has been up to now the worlds greatest
civilizer Very shortly without doubt it will be replaced by the
avenue of the skies If we are to strive for freedom of the seas what
shall we say about freedom of this new element The laws of aerial
travel and aerial warfare open an unlimited field of speculation
II
THE TRANSITION TO PEACE
Developments during the war despite their startling sensational
character had however been so overshadowed by human suffering and
desperation that but few minds were awake to the changes that were to
influence mans future Amid the disasters battles and unprecedented
movements in the politics of nations the achievements of flight could
command but a passing notice People looked and wondered but were
distracted from following their thoughts through to the logical
conclusion by the roar of a seventymile gun the collapse of a
nation or the shock of battle on a onehundredmile front
Let us however weave together a few things that were done in those
days of sensation which may have a particular effect on the future of
the science Most conspicuous perhaps was the obliteration of
distance and of all the customary limitations of travel German
airplanes in squadrons penetrated into snug little England when the
German fleet stood locked in its harbor The Italian poet DAnnunzio
dropped leaflets over Vienna when his armies were held at bay at the
Alps French British and finally American planes brought the war
home to cities of the Rhine which never even saw the Allied troops
till Germany had surrendered
None of the conventional barriers stood in the way of these long
trips A new route of travel had been opened up along which men flew
at will The boundarylines of states below which look so formidable
on the map were passed over with the greatest ease as well as such
natural obstacles as the Alps and the English Channel
Tremendous saving in time was constantly being effected Men were able
to dart back and forth from the front to the rear and from England to
France with a speed never dreamed of by other means of travel To be
sure the frontline demands for planes were too severe to allow a
very wide use in this way but nevertheless the possibilities were
there and were constantly availed of1
Indeed the British early established a communication squadron for
this specific purpose In the last three months of the war 279
crosscountry passenger flights were made to such places as Paris
Nancy Dunkirk and Manchester all of them without a single accident
Moreover a Channel ferry service was created which in seventyone
days of flying weather made 227 crossings covered over 8000 miles
and carried 1843 passengers
With trains seldom going above 60 miles an hour the slowest airplane
went 80 and the average daylight plane on the front probably equaled
110 The fast fighters went up to 120 130 and even 140 miles an
hour over twice as fast as any method of travel previously known
Just as the curtain closed on the war there had been developed in the
United States a plane credited with 16223 miles an hour and no one
for a moment believed that the limit had been reached
Altitude likewise had been obliterated The customary height for
twoseated observation and bombing planes was between one and two
miles and of singleseated scouts between two and four miles These
altitudes were not the freakish heights occasionally obtained by
adventurous fliers on the contrary they were the customary levels at
which the different kinds of duties were carried out Many men of
course went far higher Since then an American Roland Rohlfs flying
a Curtiss Wasp set the unofficial altitude record at 34610
feethigher than the worlds highest mountain
Life at these altitudes was not possible of course under ordinary
conditions The temperature fell far below zero and the air became so
thin that neither man nor engine could function unaided As a result
the fliers were kept from freezing by electrically heated clothing and
from unconsciousness from lack of air by artificially supplied oxygen
Similarly the oil water and gasolene of the engine were kept working
by special methods
The armistice threw the different nations into a dilemma as to their
aviation plans Obviously the huge war planes which were still in the
building in all the belligerent countries were no longer necessary
Almost immediately therefore the placing of new contracts was halted
by the various governments enlistments stopped and plans set in
motion for the new requirements
Within a very short time the United States canceled several hundred
million dollars worth of contracts on which little actual
expenditure had been made by the manufacturers Shipments of men and
planes overseas were of course brought to an end and at the same time
arrangements were made for bringing back from France the great aerial
equipment mobilized there Indeed the air service units were among
the first to be returned especially the labor and construction troops
in England
Nevertheless military aviation of the future was definitely
safeguarded A bill was presented to Congress for an aerial force of
4000 officers and 22000 men a fitting contrast to the force of 65
officers and 1120 men with which the country had entered the war
Certain flying fields and schools which had shown the greatest value
in the past and promised most for the future were definitely
designated for permanent use and especial effort was made to keep in
the service the best of the technical experts and designers who had
helped to solve Americas problems of the air
Abroad demobilization was less rapid as it was in all other lines
The British who had given particular thought to afterwar aviation
immediately turned to converting all their valuable war material and
experience into a national force which should assure England of the
supremacy of the air as well as strength in her supremacy of the seas
France the custodian of Germanys great aerial force found more than
enough work for all her men in taking care of the hundreds of
surrendered machines Both nations at the same time took long steps
toward building up the civil machinery necessary for private
nonmilitary flying
For several months of course there was a hiatus Thought had been so
concentrated on military aviation that the conversion to peace work
proved slow Only the most general plans had been made in any of the
countries and those by ardent supporters of aviation who were forced
to make the most earnest efforts to obtain consideration of the
subject in the midst of all the vital problems of peace and
reconstruction Greatest of all the difficulties was that as private
flying had been prohibited during the war there were with the coming
of peace no rules and regulations ready for it Also many great
projects for international flights had to be postponed because of
complete lack of international rules in this respect
Nevertheless most spectacular and convincing flights followed one
another in rapid succession The most outstanding of these flights
was of course the first crossing of the Atlantic by seaplanea
triumph of organized effort by the navy At the same time all over the
world flights took place with astounding frequency which illustrated
as little else could the certain future of aviation Seas mountains
deserts places otherwise almost impassable were traversed with ease
and speed
Army fliers flew from the Atlantic to the Pacific within a few months
of the signing of the armistice It required but fifty hours of
flyingtime just a fraction over two days At that time no attempt
was made to obtain speed as the purpose of the trip had been to
locate landingfields and make aerial maps for future transcontinental
flights
The four planes that made this trip might be considered as the
pioneers of vast flocks of airplanes which within a short time will be
winging their way from coast to coast If with machines built
specifically for war purposes and with no special landingfields or
routes laid out aviators could successfully travel from one coast to
the other in fifty hours of flyingtime how much more rapidly will
future trips be made when special touringplanes have been developed
routes and landingfields are laid out repairshops are built and
the trip becomes a matter of routine rather than aerial experiments
The effect that this new method of travel will have on American life
and development is staggering to the imagination San Francisco and
New York will be almost neighbors while Chicago and New Orleans will
be but a pleasant days trip apart The business man the statesman
and even the courier can be transported from one end of the country to
the other independent of steel rails and other devices in record
time
Such experiments have already proved successful in Europe The British
Foreign Office in London anxious to keep in close touch with the
Peace Conference at Paris turned to the airplane to assure quick
transportation of men and documents The slow train trip with the
irksome transfer to and from the Channel steamer and the more irksome
voyage across the Channel itself were avoided by a special service
through the air Thus two great capitals were brought within a few
hours time of each other which greatly facilitated the vital
negotiations under way
Civilians were finally granted the right to make the trip under
military supervision Fourteen passengers were transported from Paris
to London in two hours and forty minutes as against six hours and
forty minutes the fastest time ever made by any other means of
travel Each of them had twenty pounds of luggage and luncheon of
cold ham and champagne was served on board over the Channel followed
by a game of cards It was easily demonstrated by the return trip that
men could leave either capital after breakfast have several hours in
the other and return home for dinner
Then a French flier with six passengers made the flight from Paris to
Brussels The time consumed between the two capitals was but two hours
as against over five by the ordinary train travel As an instance of
some of the problems which this particular flight brought about it
was observed that a Belgian policeman approached the plane as it was
about to leave and inquired for passports and papers Everybody made
excuses for not having them The policeman refused to allow the
airplane to leave Finally the pilot losing his patience and temper
started the motor and flew off before the angered official knew what
had happened
Two other French aviators about the same time crossed the
Mediterranean from France to Algiers and back in the same day Though
unequipped with seaplane devices they started out with full
confidence that their motors would carry them over the water With
only their navigating instruments and an occasional vessel to guide
them they reached their destination after a perfect trip and created
a great sensation among the natives who came down to see the airplanes
alight
Far more spectacular however was the flight made from London to
Delhi A HandleyPage machine which had flown from London to Cairo
during the war and taken part in the final military operations against
the Turks left Cairo on November 30th shortly after the armistice
Five and threequarter hours later the airplane with five passengers
reached Damascus a trip practically impossible except through the air
because of the ravages of the war At 740 the next morning they set
out again flew northeast along the Jebel esh Shekh Range to Palmyra
then east to the Euphrates down that river to Ramadi and thence
across to Bagdad a flight of 510 miles made in six hours and fifty
minutes without a single stop part of it over country untrod even by
the most primitive travelers Thence they went on via Bushire
Bander Abbas Tcharbar and Karachi to Delhi where they received a
tremendous ovation as the first fliers to arrive from the home
country From Delhi they continued on without mishap to Calcutta This
distance from Cairo to Karachi 2548 miles was made in thirtysix
hours flyingtime from Karachi to Delhi the distance is 704 miles
and from Delhi to Calcutta 300 a total of 4052 miles from the main
city of Egypt to the greatest commercial port of India No route had
been surveyed no landingplaces obtained no facilities provided
Territory inaccessible to ordinary travel land where the white man is
almost a stranger was crossed Yet it was all done as part of the
days work in no sense as a recordbreaking or spectacular trip
The certainty of flight from London to India was demonstrated A
biweekly service for both passengers and mails was at once planned
Almost immediately preparations for the route were worked out
twentyfive airdromes and landingfields were designated of which the
main ones would be at Cairo and Basra on the Tigris with subsidiary
fields at Marseilles Pisa or Rome Taranto Sollum Bushire
Damascus Bagdad Bander Abbas Karachi Hyderabad and Jodhpur It
is estimated that the flight of 6000 miles at stages of about 350
each would take seven or eight days as against the present train and
steamer time of five or six weeks At the same time another route far
shorter than that which would be necessary by following the sea route
lies over Germany Russia and the ideal flyingland along the Caspian
Sea Krasnovodsk Askabad Herat Kandahar and Multan
As with Asia Minor and Asia so with Africa the British at once made
plans for aerial routes Only a few weeks after the armistice
announcement was made of plans for an All Red Air Route from Cairo
across the desert and the jungle to the Cape This could all be done
over British territory with the part over Lakes Victoria Nyanza and
Tanganyika covered by hydroplanes The moment men were released from
the war surveying of this route was begun and tentative plans made
for landingfields every 200 miles over the 5700mile trip
The air is ours to do whatever we can with it There must be developed
a large interest in this country in the business of flying We must
make the air our third fastest and most reliable means of
communication between points in a way to compete with transportation
on land and sea The airplane instead of being the unusual thing
must become a customary sight over our cities and villages The first
step in the development is the training of airplane pilots and
mechanics

TRAINING AN AIRPLANE PILOT
Any ordinary active man can fly That is to say any man with nerve
enough to take a cold bath or drive an automobile down Fifth Avenue
can maintain himself in the air with an airplane and turn into a good
pilot with practice In other words the regular man who rides in the
Subway who puts on a straw hat on May 15th or 20th as the case may
be has not only the right to be in the air but owes it to himself to
learn to fly
Any one with a reasonable amount of intelligence can be made a good
pilot He need not hold a college degree or even a highschool
diploma tucked away in some forgotten place If he has the sense of
touch of the normal man the sense of balance of a normal man can
skate or ride a bicycle he should be in the air flying There is a
difference between the war or army pilot and the peacetime flier yet
to be developed
War flying calls for highly trained men a man who has proved himself
fit for combat under all conditions a man who can shoot straight
think quickly and turn immediately He must possess a little more
than the average nerve perhaps or he must be trained to the point
where shooting and maneuvering are the natural reactions to certain
circumstances He must be able to stand altitudes of 20000 feet he
must be quick with his machinegun have a knowledge of artillery and
