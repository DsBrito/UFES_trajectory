One major point of confusion should be mentioned In the
section on the Seven Wonders of the World what is usually
described as the Lighthouse of Pharos appears to have been
merged with the socalled Egyptian Labyrinth described by
Herodotussee the title and the description in the text In
the next section the Pyramids of Egypt there is a reference
to a black marble head on the third pyramidperhaps this
represents some confusion with the Sphynx

THE
INTRODUCTION
I AM very much concerned when I see young gentlemen of fortune and
quality so wholly set upon pleasure and diversions that they neglect
all those improvements in wisdom and knowledge which may make them
easy to themselves and useful to the world  The greatest part of our
British youth lose their figure and grow out of fashion by that
time they are five and twenty  As soon as the natural gaiety and
amiableness of the young man wears off they have nothing left to
recommend them but lie by the rest of their lives among the lumber
and refuse of the species  It sometimes happens indeed that for
want of applying themselves in due time to the pursuit of knowledge
they take up a book in their declining years and grow very hopeful
scholars by the time they are threescore  I must therefore earnestly
press my readers who are in the flower of their youth to labour at
those accomplishments which may set off their persons when their
bloom is gone and to lay in timely provisions for manhood and old
age  In short I would advise the youth of fifteen to be dressing
up every day the man of fifty or to consider how to make himself
venerable at threescore
Young men who are naturally ambitious would do well to observe how
the greatest men of antiquity made it their ambition to excel all
their contemporaries in knowledge Julius CAsar and Alexander the
most celebrated instances of human greatness took a particular care
to distinguish themselves by their skill in the arts and sciences We
have still extant several remains of the former which justify the
character given of him by the learned men of his own age As for the
latter it is a known saying of his that he was more obliged to
Aristotle who had instructed him than to Philip who had given him
life and empire There is a letter of his recorded by Plutarch and
Aulus Gellius which he wrote to Aristotle upon hearing that he had
published those lectures he had given him in private  This letter
was written in the following words at a time when he was in the
height of his Persian conquest
ALEXANDER to ARISTOTLE greeting
You have not done well to publish your books of select
knowledge for what is there now in which I can surpass
others if those things which I have been instructed
in     are communicated to every body For my own part I
declare to you I would rather excel others in knowledge
than in power
Farewel
We see by this letter that the love of conquest was but a second
ambition in Alexanders soul  Knowledge is indeed that which next
to virtue truly and essentially raises one man above another  It
furnishes one half of the human soul  It makes life pleasant to
us fills the mind with entertaining views and administers to it a
perpetual series of gratifications  It gives ease to solitude and
gracefulness to retirement  It fills a public station with suitable
abilities and adds a lustre to those who are in possession of them
Learning by which I mean all useful knowledge whether speculative
or practical is in popular and mixt governments the natural source
of wealth and honour  If we look into most of the reigns from the
conquest we shall find that the favourites of each reign have been
those who have raised themselves  The greatest men are generally the
growth of that particular age in which they flourish  A superior
capacity for business and a more extensive knowledge are the steps
by which a new man often mounts to favour and outshines the rest of
his contemporaries  But when men are actually born to titles it
is almost impossible that they should fail of receiving additional
greatness if they take care to accomplish themselves for it
The story of Solomons choice does not only instruct us in that point
of history but furnishes out a very fine moral to us namely that
he who applies his heart to wisdom does at the same time take the
most proper method for gaining long life riches and reputation
which are very often not only the reward but the effects of wisdom

NOTES AND POINTS
USED IN
Writing and Printing
Before I begin to lay down rules for reading it will be necessary
to take notice of the several points or marks used in printing or
writing for resting or stopping the voice which are four in
number called
1 The Comma            3 Colon
2 Semicolon            4 Period
These points are to give a proper time for breathing when you read
and to prevent confusion of sense in joining words together in a
sentence The Comma stops the readers voice till he can tell
one and divides the lesser parts of a sentence  The Semicolon
divides the greater parts of a sentence and requires the reader to
pause while he can count two  The Colon is used where the sense
is complete and not the sentence and rests the voice of the reader
till he can count three  The Period is put when the sentence
is ended and requires a pause while he can tell four
But we must here remark that the Colon and Semicolon are
frequently used promiscuously especially in our bibles
There are two other points which may be called marks of affection
the one of which is termed an Interrogation which signifies a
question being asked and expressed thus  the other called an
Admiration or Exclamation and marked thus   These two
points require a pause as long as a period
We have twelve other marks to be met with in reading namely
1 Apostrophe   a     7  Section     A
2 Hyphen            8  Ellipsis
3 Parenthesis        9  Index        index
hand pointing rightwards
4 Brackets           10 Asterisk
5 Paragraph         11 Obelisk     a
6 Quotation         12 Caret
Apostrophe is set over a word where some letter is wanting as in
lovd  Hyphen joins syllables and words together as in
pancake  Parenthesis includes something not necessary to the
sense as I know that in me that is in my flesh liveth c
Brackets include a word or words mentioned as a matter of
discourse as The little word man makes a great noise c
They are also used to enclose a cited sentence or what is to be
explained and sometimes the explanation itself  Brackets and
Parenthesis are often used for each other without distinction
Paragraph is chiefly used in the bible and denotes the beginning
of a new subject  Quotation is used to distinguish what is taken
from an author in his own words  Section shews the division of a
chapter  Ellipsis is used when part of a word or sentence is
omitted as pce  Index denotes some remarkable passage
Asterisk refers to some note in the margin or remarks at the
bottom of the page and when many stand together thus  they
imply that something is wanting or not fit to be read in the
author  The Obelisk or Dagger and also parallel lines
marked thus  refer to something in the margin  The Caret
marked thus  is made use of in writing when any line or word is
left out and wrote over where it is to come in as thus
had
A certain man two sons
Here the word had was left out wrote over and marked by the
Caret where to come in
It may also in this place be proper to mention the crooked lines or
Braces which couple two or three words or lines together that
tend to the same thing for instance
a long
The vowel a has      a short      Sound
a broad
This is often used in poetry where three lines have the same rhyme
The other marks relate to single words as Dialysis or DiAresis
placed over vowels to shew they must be pronounced in distinct
syllables as RaphaAl  The Circumflex is set over a vowel to
carry a long sound as EuphrAtes  An Accent is marked thus
A to shew where the emphasis must be placed as neglAct or
to shew that the consonant following must be pronounced double as
hA3mage  To these may be added the long A  and short E marks
which denote the quantity of syllables as wAtAr
RULES FOR READING
When you have gained a perfect knowledge of the sounds of the
letters never guess at a word on sight lest you get a habit of
reading falsely  Pronounce every word distinctly  Let the tone of
your voice be the same in reading as in speaking  Never read in a
hurry lest you learn to stammer  Read no louder than to be heard
by those about you  Observe to make your pauses  regular and make
not any where the sense will admit of none  Suit your voice to the
subject  Be attentive to those who read well and remember to
imitate their pronunciation  Read often before good judges and
thank them for correcting you  Consider well the place of emphasis
and pronounce it accordingly For the stress of voice is the same
with regard to sentences as in words  The emphasis or force of
voice is for the most part laid upon the accented syllable but if
there is a particular opposition between two words in a sentence
one whereof differs from the other in parts the accent must be
removed from its place for instance The sun shines upon the just
and upon the unjust  Here the emphasis is laid upon the first
syllable in unjust because it is opposed to just in the same
sentence without which opposition it would lie in its proper place
that is on the last syllable as we must not imitate the unjust
practices of others
The general rule for knowing which is the emphatical word in a
sentence is to consider the design of the whole for particular
directions cannot be easily given excepting only where words
evidently oppose one another in a sentence and those are always
emphatical  So frequently is the word that asks a question as
who what when c but not always  Nor must the emphasis be
always laid upon the same words in the same sentence but varied
according to the principal meaning of the speaker  Thus suppose I
enquire Did my father walk abroad yesterday  If I lay the
emphasis on the word father it is evident I want to know whether
it was he or somebody else  If I lay it upon walk the
person I speak to will know that I want to be informed whether he
went on foot or rode on horseback  If I put the emphasis upon
yesterday it denotes that I am satisfied that my father went
abroad and on foot though I want to be informed whether it was
yesterday or some time before
RULES TO READ VERSE
There are two ways of writing on a subject namely in prose and
verse  Prose is the common way of writing without being
confined to a certain number of syllables or having the trouble of
disposing of the words in any particular form  Verse requires
words to be ranged so as the accents may naturally fall on
particular syllables and make a sort of harmony to the ear This
is termed metre or measure to which rhyme is generally added
that is to make two or more verses near to each other and with
the same sound but this practice is not absolutely necessary for
that which has no rhyme is called blank verse
In metre the words must be so disposed as that the accent may fall
on every second fourth and sixth syllable and also on the
eighth tenth and twelfth if the lines run to that length
The following verse of ten syllables may serve for an example
The mA3narch spA3ke and strAit a mAormur rA3se
But English poetry allows of frequent variations from this rule
especially in the first and second syllables in the line as in the
verse which rhymes with the former where the accent is laid upon
the first syllable
LA3ud as the sAorges whAn the tAmpest blA3ws
But there are two sorts of metre which vary from this rule one of
which is when the verse contains but seven syllables and the accent
lies upon the first third fifth and seventh as below
CA3uld we whAch we nAver cAn
StrAtch our lAves beyA3nd their spAn
BeAuty lAke a shAdow flAes
And our yA3uth befA3re us dAes
The other sort has a hasty sound and requires an accent upon every
third syllable as
Tis the vA3ice of the slAoggard I heAr him complAin
You have wAkd me too soA3n I must slAomber agAin
You must always observe to pronounce a verse as you do prose giving
each word and syllable its natural accent with these two
restrictions First If there is no point at the end of the line
make a short pause before you begin the next  Secondly If any
word in a line has two sounds give it that which agrees best with
the rhyme and metre for example the word glittering must
sometimes be pronounced as of three syllables and sometimes
glittring as of two
The USE of CAPITALS and the different LETTERS used in PRINTING
The names of the letters made use of in printed books are
distinguished thus The round full and upright are called
Roman the long leaning narrow letters are called Italic and
the ancient black character is called English  You have a
specimen as follows viz
Illustration the word Angel in Roman Italic and Fraktur
which they call Old English
The Old English is seldom used but in acts of parliament
proclamations c  The Roman is chiefly in vogue for books and
pamphlets intermixed with Italic to distinguish proper names
chapters arguments words in any foreign language texts of
scripture citations from authors speeches or sayings of any
person emphatical words and whatever is strongly significant
The use of capitals or great letters is to begin every name of the
Supreme Being as God Lord Almighty Father Son c  All proper
names of men and things titles of distinction as King Duke Lord
Knight c must also begin with a capital  So ought every book
chapter verse paragraph and sentence after a period  A saying
or quotation from any author should begin with a capital as ought
every line in a poem  I and O when they stand single must always
be capitals any words particularly names or substantives may
begin with a capital but the common way of beginning every
substantive with a capital is not commendable and is now much
disused
Capitals are likewise often used for ornament as in the title of
books and also to express numbers and abbreviations
Illustration Woodcut of Ancient Britons
A CONCISE
ACCOUNT OF ANCIENT BRITAIN
CHAP I
ENGLAND and Scotland though but one island are two kingdoms viz
the kingdom of England and the kingdom of Scotland which two
kingdoms being united were in the reign of James I called
GreatBritain  The shape of it is triangular as thus triangle
and tis surrounded by the seas  Its utmost extent or length is 812
miles its breadth is 320 and its circumference 1836 and it is
reckoned one of the finest islands in Europe The whole island was
anciently called Albion which seems to have been softened from
Alpion because the word alp in some of the original western
languages generally signifies very high lands or hills as this
isle appears to those who approach it from the Continent  It was
likewise called Olbion which in the Greek signifies happy but of
those times there is no certainty in history more than that it had
the denomination and was very little known by the rest of the
world
The people that first lived in this island according to the best
historians were the Gauls and afterwards the Britons  These
Britons were tall well made and yellow haired and lived
frequently a hundred and twenty years owing to their sobriety and
temperance and the wholesomeness of the air  The use of clothes
was scarce known among them  Some of them that inhabited the
southern parts covered their nakedness with the skins of wild beasts
carelessly thrown over them not so much to defend themselves
against the cold as to avoid giving offence to strangers that came
to traffic among them  By way of ornament they used to cut the
shape of flowers and trees and animals on their skin and
afterwards painted it of a sky colour with the juice of woad that
never wore out They lived in woods in huts covered with skins
boughs or turfs  Their towns and villages were a confused parcel
of huts placed at a little distance from each other without any
order or distinction of streets  They were generally in the middle
of a wood defended with ramparts or mounds of earth thrown up
Ten or a dozen of them friends and brothers lived together and
had their wives in common  Their food was milk and flesh got by
hunting their woods and plains being well stocked with game  Fish
and tame fowls which they kept for pleasure they were forbid by
their religion to eat
The chief commerce was with the the PhAnician merchants who after
the discovery of the island exported every year great quantities of
tin with which they drove a very gainful trade with distant
nations
In this situation were the Ancient Britons when Julius CAsar the
first Emperor of Rome and a great conqueror formed a design of
invading their island which the Britons hearing of they
endeavoured to divert him from his purpose by sending ambassadors
with offers of obedience to him which he refused and in the 55th
year before the coming of our Saviour upon earth he embarked in
Gaul that is France a great many soldiers on board eighty ships
At his arrival on the coast of Britain he saw the hills and cliffs
that ran out into the sea covered with troops that could easily
prevent his landing on which he sailed two leagues farther to a
plain and open shore which the Britons perceiving sent their
chariots and horse that way whilst the rest of their army advanced
to support them  The largeness of CAsars vessels hindered them
from coming near the shore so that the Roman soldiers saw
themselves under a necessity of leaping into the sea armed as they
were in order to attack their enemies who stood ready to receive
them on the dry ground  CAsar perceiving that his soldiers did not
exert their usual bravery ordered some small ships to get as near
the shore as possible which they did and with their slings
engines and arrows so pelted the Britons that their courage began
to abate  But the Romans were unwilling to throw themselves into
the water till one of the standardbearers leaped in first with his
colours in his hand crying out aloud Follow me fellow soldiers
unless you will betray the Roman Eagle into the hands of the enemy
For my part I am resolved to discharge my duty to Caesar and the
Commonwealth  Whereupon all the soldiers followed him and began
to fight  But their resolution was not able to compel the Britons
to give ground nay it was feared they would have been repelled
had not CAsar caused armed boats to supply them with recruits
which made the enemy fall back a little  The Romans improving this
advantage advanced and getting firm footing on land pressed the
Britons so vigorously that they put them to the rout  The Britons
astonished at the Roman valour and fearing a more obstinate
resistance would but expose them to greater mischiefs sent to sue
for peace and offer hostages which CAsar accepted and a peace was
concluded four days after their landing  Thus having given an
account of Ancient Britain and CAsars invasion we shall proceed
to the History of England and the several Kings by whom it has been
governed
A COMPENDIOUS
HISTORY OF ENGLAND
CHAP II
AS England was long governed by Kings who were natives of the
country so it may not be improper to distinguish that tract of time
by the name of the British Period  Those Kings were afterwards
subdued by the Romans and the time that warlike people retained
their conquest we shall call the Roman Period  When the Saxons
brought this country under their subjection we shall denominate the
time of their sway the Saxon Period  Lastly when the Danes invaded
England and conquered it we shall term the series of years they
possessed it the Danish Period
This country was originally called Albion but one Brutus a Grecian
hero having landed here about 1100 years before Christ changed the
ancient name to Britannia from which time to the arrival of Julius
CAsar here there had reigned sixtynine Kings all natives of
England
In respect to the Roman Period we may observe that Julius CAsar
first landed in Britain from Gallia and made it tributary to the
Romans but soon after the birth of Christ the Emperor Claudius
brought this country entirely under his subjection and the Emperor
Adrian built the long wall between England and Scotland
In the beginning of the second century the Christian religion was
planted in England and in the fifth century the Britons finding
themselves overpowered by the Scots called over the Saxons to their
assistance who were so charmed with the country that they
determined to continue here and subdue it
The most remarkable occurrences in the Saxon Period are that such
of them who embarked for England had been particularly distinguished
by the name of Angles and from them the name of Britannia was
changed to that of Anglia  The Saxons also divided the country
among themselves into seven kingdoms known by the name of the Saxon
Heptarchy viz  1 Kent 2 Essex 3 Sussex 4 Wessex 5 East
Anglia 6 Mercia 7 Northumberland  But at length Wessex
overpowering the rest formed them all into one monarchy
One of those WestSaxon Kings called Ina made many good laws some
of which are still extant he also was the first that granted
Peters pence to the Pope
In regard to the Danish Period we shall only remark that the Danes
had for a long time acted as pirates or sea robbers upon the English
coasts and made several incursions into the country when their
King Canute possessed himself of the crown of England however their
government did not continue long
Canute reigned eighteen years and left three sons Harold Canute
and Sueno to the first he gave England to the second Denmark and
to the third Norway
Harold reigned five years and was succeeded by his halfbrother
HardiCanute who died two years after and with him ended the
tyrannical government of the Danes in England
THE
INTERMEDIATE HISTORY OF ENGLAND
CHAP III
WE shall divide this part of our history into four periods 1 The
Kings of the Norman Line 2 Those of the House of Anjou 3 Of the
House of Lancaster 4 Of the House of York
The NORMAN KINGS
WILLIAM I sirnamed sic the Conqueror gained a signal victory
over King Harold by which means he procured the crown of England
This Prince was the son of Robert Duke of Normandy by one of his
mistresses called Harlotte from whom some think the word harlot is
derived however as this amour seems odd we shall entertain the
reader with an account of it  The Duke riding one day to take the
air passed by a company of country girls who were dancing and was
so taken with the graceful carriage of one of them named Harlotte
a skinners daughter that he prevailed on her to cohabit with him
and she was ten months after delivered of William who having
reigned 21 years died at Rouen in September 1087
WILLIAM II sirnamed Rufus succeeded his father he built
Westminsterhall rebuilt Londonbridge and made a new wall round
the Tower of London  In his time the sea overflowed a great part of
the estate belonging to Earl Goodwin in Kent which is at this day
called the Goodwin Sands  The King was killed accidentally by an
arrow in the New Forest and left no issue  He reigned fourteen
years and was buried in Winchester Cathedral
HENRY I youngest son of William the Conqueror succeeded his
brother William II in 1100  He reduced Normandy and made his son
Duke thereof  This Prince died in Normandy of a surfeit by eating
lampreys after hunting having reigned 35 years
STEPHEN sirnamed of Blois succeeded his uncle Henry I in 1135
but being continually harassed by the Scotch and Welsh and having
reigned 19 years in an uninterrupted series of troubles he died at
Dover in 1154 and was buried in the Abbey at Feversham which he
had erected for the burial place of himself and family
HENRY II son of Geoffrey Plantagenet Earl of Anjou succeeded
Stephen in 1154  In him the Norman and Saxon blood was united and
with him began the race of the Plantagenets which ended with
Richard III  In this Kings reign Thomas A  Becket son to a
tradesman in London being made Lord High Chancellor and afterwards
Archbishop of Canterbury affected on all occasions to oppose and to
be independent of the court  The King hearing of his misbehaviour
complained that he had not one to revenge him on a wretched priest
for the many insults he had put upon him  Hereupon four of his
domestics in hopes to gain favour set out immediately for
Canterbury and beat out Thomass brains with clubs as he was
saying vespers in his own cathedral in so cruel a manner that the
altar was covered with blood  King Henry subdued Ireland and died
there in 1189 in the 34th year of his reign
RICHARD I succeeded his father Henry II and was no sooner crowned
than he took upon him the cross and went with Philip King of
France to the Holy Land in 1192  On his return he was detained by
the Emperor Henry VI and was obliged to pay 100000 marks for his
ransom  In a war which succeeded between England and France
Richard fought personally in the field and gained a complete
victory over the enemy but was afterwards shot by an arrow at the
siege of the Castle of Chalus and died of the wound April 6 1199
JOHN the fourth son of Henry II took possession of the crown on
Richards decease though his nephew Arthur of Bretagne son of his
elder brother Geoffrey Plantagenet had an undoubted title to it
His encroachments on the privileges of his people called forth the
opposition of the spirited and potent Barons of that day John was
reduced to great straits and Pope Innocent III with the usual
policy of the Holy Fathers sided with Johns disaffected subjects
and fulminated the thunders of the church against him till he had
brought him to his own terms the King surrendered his crown at the
feet of the Popes Legate who returned it to him on his
acknowledging that he held it as the vassal of the Holy See and
binding himself and successors to pay an annual tribute thereto
The Barons and their cause were to be sacrificed to the Popes
interest and the Legate commanded them to lay down their arms they
were however bold enough to make head against this powerful league
and by their steady opposition to the King and their moderate
demands when their efforts were crowned with success immortalized
their names John was obliged to sign out two famous chartersthe
first called Magna Charta or the Charter of Liberties the second
the Charter of Forests which two charters have since been the
