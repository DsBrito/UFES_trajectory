Every time he sauntered carelessly across the porch he gave a
correct Imitation of a troop of Cavalry going over a Wooden
Bridge                                                           43

He was dazed and horrified to find himself suddenly

Nearly every evening the Tradesman would back up to the Student

ADES FABLES
THE NEW FABLE OF THE PRIVATE AGITATOR AND WHAT HE COOKED UP
Ambition came with Sterling Silver BreastPlate and Flaming Sword
and sat beside a Tad aged 5 The wee Hopeful lived in a Frame House
with Box Pillars in front and Hollyhocks leading down toward the Pike
Whither shall I guide you asked Ambition Are you far enough from
the Shell to have any definite Hankering
I have spent many Hours brooding over the possibilities of the
Future replied the Larva I want to grow up to be a Joey in a
Circus I fairly ache to sit in a Red Wagon just behind the Band and
drive a Trick Mule with little pieces of Looking Glass in the Harness
I want to pull Mugs at all the scared Country Girls peeking out of the
Wagon Beds The Town Boys will leave the Elephant and trail behind my
comical Chariot In my Hour of Triumph the Air will be impregnated
with Calliope Music and the Smell of PopCorn modified by Wild
Animals
Ambition went out to make the proper Bookings with Destiny When he
came back the Boy was ten years old
We started wrong whispered Ambition curling up in the cool grass
near the DayDreamer The Trick Mule and the Red Cart are all very
well for little FraidyCats and Softies but a brave Youth of High
Spirit should tread the Deck of his own Ship with a Cutlass under his
Red Sash Aye that is Blood gauming up the Scuppers but is the
Captain chickenhearted Up with the Black Flag Let it be give and
take with Pieces of Eight for the Victor
So it was settled that the Lad was to hurry through the Graded Schools
and then get at his Buccaneering
But Ambition came back with a revised Program You are now Fifteen
Years of Age said the Wonderful Guide with the glittering Suit It
is High Time that you planned a Noble Career following a Straight
Course from which there shall be no Deviation The Pirate is a mere
swaggering Bravo and almost Unscrupulous at times Why not be a great
Military Commander The Procedure is Simple Your Father gives the
Finger to the Congressman and then you step off the Boat at West
Point Next thing you know you are wearing a Nobby Uniform right out
on the Parade Ground while bevies of Debutantes from New York City
and other Points admire you for the stern Profile and Military SetUp
After that you will subdue many Savage Tribes and then you will march
up Pennsylvania Avenue at the head of the whole Regular Army and the
President of the United States will be waiting on the Front Porch of
the White House to present you with a jewelled Sword on behalf of a
Grateful Nation
You are right said the Stripling His eyes were like Saucers and
his Nostrils quivered I will be CommanderinChief and after I am
laid away with the Cannon booming the Folks in this very Town will
put up a Statue of Me at the corner of Sixth and Main so the
StreetCars will have to circle to get around it
Consequently when he was in his 21st Year he was sitting at a high
Desk in an Office watching the Birds on a Telegraph Wire The
Knowledge he had acquired at the two Prep Schools before being pushed
into the Fresh Air ahead of Time had not made him roundshouldered He
was a likely Chap but he wore no Plumes
He became dimly conscious that Ambition was squatted on the Stool next
to him
Up to this time we have been Dead Wrong said the Periodical
Visitor There is only one Prize worth winning and that is the Love
of the Niftiest Nectarine that ever came down a Crystal Stairway from
the Celestial Regions to grace this dreary World with her Holy
Presence Yes I mean the One you passed this morningthe One with
her hair in a Net and the Cameo Brooch Why not annex her by Legal
Routine and settle down in a neat Cottage purchased from the Building
and Loan Association You could raise your own Vegetables Go to it
Four years elapse Our Hero now has everything The jerrybuilt home
of the Early Bungalow Period stands up bravely under the Mortgage
Little Dorothy is suspended in a Jump Chair on the Veranda facing
Myrtle Avenue along which the Green Cars run direct to City Hall
Square The Goddess is in the kitchen trying to make preserves out of
Watermelon Rinds with the White House Cook Book propped open in front
of her Friend Husband is weeding the Azaleas and grieving over the
failure of the EggPlant
He finds himself gently prodded and there is Ambition once more at
his Elbow
You are entitled to One Hundred Thousand Dollars murmurs the
stealthy Promoter Why should some other Citizen have his CoalBin
right in the House while you carry it from a Shed Your Wife should
sit at her own Dinner Table and make signs at the Maid And as you
ride to your Work with the other deadeyed Cattle and see all those
StrongArm Johnnies coming out of their Brick Mansions to hop into
their own Broughams and Coupes have you not asked yourself why you
are in the HorseCars with the Plebes when you might be in a Private
Rig with the Patricians
For wot ye Gentle Reader all this unwound from the Reel before the
first Trolley Car climbed a Hill or the first Horseless Carriage came
chugging sternly up the Boulevard
So Ambition received special Instructions to make Our Hero worth
100000
Those were the days of tall Hustling If he saw an Opening six inches
wide he held it with his Foot until he could insert his Elbow and
then he braced his Shoulder and the first thing you knew he was on
the Inside demanding a fair cut of the Swag
The Golden Rule received many a Jolt but he adhered strictly to the
old and favorite Admonition If you want Yours take a short piece of
Lead Pipe and go out and Collect
On a certain January First he made a careful Invoice All the
HardEarned Kale dropped into the Mining Companies or loaned to
Relatives of Wife he marked off and put under the Head of Gone but not
Forgotten He was a True Business Guy Even after subtracting all Cats
and Dogs he could still total the magnificent Sum of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars
When he looked at this Mound of Currency he felt like a Vag and a
Pauper For he had climbed to the tablelands of High Finance and
taken a peek at the SteamRoller methods of the Real Tabascos
Make it a Million said Ambition leaning across the Table and
tapping nervously Are you going to be satisfied with a Station Wagon
and a Colored Boy when you might have a longwaisted Vehicle with two
pale Simpsons in Livery on the Box When you go into your Club and see
the Menials kowtowing to a coldlooking Party with rippling Chins who
seems to favor his Feet you know that he gets the Waving Palms and
the Frankincense because he is a Millionaire You and the other
financial Gnats are admitted simply to make a Stage Setting for the
Big Squash
I always said that when I got a Hundred Thousand Id take a long
Vacation in Europe and learn how to order a Meal suggested Our Hero
holding out weakly
When you came back you would find your hated Rival on the Hill with
the Batteries turned against you Camp on the Job and work straight
toward the High Mark And remember that anybody with less than a
Million is a TwoSpot in a soiled Deck
From that day the Piking ceased No more of the dinky trafficking of
the Retailer He went out and bought Public Service Utilities on
Nerve treated them with Aqua Pura by the Hogshead and created Wealth
by purely lithographic Methods And if he wanted to reason out a Deal
with a contraryminded Gazook he began the Negotiations by soaking
the Adversary behind the Ear and frisking him before he came to
A Fairy Wand had been waved above the snide Bungalow and it was now a
Queen Anne Chateau dripping with Dewdads of Scroll Work and congested
with Black Walnut The Goddess took her Mocha in the Feathers and a
Music Teacher came twice each week to bridge the awful chasm between
Dorothy and Chopin Dinner had been moved up to Milking Time
Sweetbreads and Artichokes came into the Lives of the Trio thus
favored by Fortune
One day the busy ThimbleRigger took his Helpmate into the lonesome
Library and broke the glad Tidings to her
I have unloaded all of my Cripples he said They have been wished
on to a Group of Philanthropists in New England Sound the glad
Tocsin I have a Million in my Kick
So she began packing the huge Saratogas and reading the Folders on
Egypt and the Riviera He sat in his Den pulling at a long black
Excepcionale Through the bluish clouds of Smoke came that old
familiar Voice
Let the Missus and the Heiress do the European Thing said Ambition
You stick around Wait for Black Friday Then get busy at the Bargain
Counter By and by the new Crop will begin to move and Money will
creep out of the Yarn Stockings and a few Wise Gazabes will cop all
the Plush In every Palm Room there are more Millionaires than Palms
But the Big Round Table over by the Fountain is always reserved by
Oscar for the Lad who can show Ten Millions
The Ocean Greyhound moved out past Sandy Hook with the Family and all
the Maids on board but Papa remained behind to sharpen his Tools and
get ready for another Killing
Every time he was given a Crimp in the Rue de la Paix he caught even
by leading a new Angora up the Chute and into the Shambles
When the fully matured Goddess and the radiant Heroine of the latest
International Alliance came home with the French Language and two tons
of Glad Raiment they found themselves reuning with the Magnate at the
big Table over by the Fountain
Our Hero was now sleeping in a Bed almost twelve feet wide with a
silk Tent over it One Morning he found the Companion of many Years
sitting on the edge of the Mattress
Again asked the MultiMillionaire What next
The Exercises up to this Time have been Preliminary said Ambition
What is the good of a Bank Roll if you cannot garnish it with the
delectable Parsley of Social Eminence Get a Wiggle on you Send for
the Boys with the Frock Coats and the Soft Hats and let them dig in to
their Elbows Tell the Press Agent to organize a typewriting Phalanx
Assume a few Mortgages on fluttering Newspapers Lay a CornerStone
ever and anon Be Interviewed
What are you leading up to asked the Financial Giant a sickly Fear
creeping into the Region formerly occupied by his Heart
The Logical Finish replied Ambition with a reassuring Pat on the
Shoulder You must go to the Senate The White Palace suitable for
entertaining purposes now awaits you in Washington The Bulb Lights
glow dimly above the Porte Cochere A red Carpet invites you to climb
the Marble Stairway and spread yourself all over the Throne On a
Receiving Night when the perfumed Aliens in their Masquerade Suits
rally around the Punch Bowl your Place will resemble the Last Act of
something by Klaw  Erlanger You will play Stud with the Makers of
History and be seen leaving the Executive Mansion
This Line of Talk landed him He Fell for it That year the Christmas
Tree drooped with valuable Gifts for the Boys who stood after they
were hitched
He went up to Washington with an eviscerated CheckBook in his Pocket
and a faint Odor of Scandal in his Wake but he was a certified
Servant of the People His Cut Flowers were the Talk in Official
Circles The most Exclusive consented to flirt with his Wine Cellar
To a mere Outsider it looked as if Ambition had certainly boosted his
Nobs to the final Himalayan Peak of Human Happiness He had a House as
big as a Hospital The Hallways were cluttered with whispering
Servants of the most immaculate and grovelling Description His Wife
and the Daughter and the CigaretteHolder she had picked up in Europe
figured in the Gay Life of the Nations Capital every Night and went
to see a Nerve Specialist every Day The whole Bunch rode gaily on the
Top Wave of the Social Swim with a Terrapin as an Escort and a squad
of CanvasBack Ducks as BodyGuard
Notwithstanding all which Father was the sorest HardShell that
motored along Pennsylvania Avenue
The Dime Denouncers printed his Picture saying that he was owned by
the Interests and hated the sight of a Poor Working Girl When the
High Class continuous Show in the Senate Chamber showed signs of
flopping and the Press Gallery became impatient some Alkali Statesman
of the New School would arise in his Place and give our Hero a
TurningOver concluding with a faithful PenPicture of the Dishonored
Grave marked by a single Headstone chiseled as follows Here lies a
Burglar
When he went traveling he had his Food smuggled into the
DrawingRoom He knew if he went drilling through the Pullmans some
of the Passengers who had seen the Cartoons might recognize him as the
notorious Malefactor
One day while he was cowering in a dark corner of his Club to get
away from the pesky Reporters he was joined by the TroubleMaker
I gave you the wrong Steer said Ambition now much subdued You
are in Dutch Beat it All the RoughNecks down by the RoundHouse
and the fretful Simps along every RFD Route are getting ready to
interfere in the Affairs of Government The Storm Clouds of Anarchy
are lowering In other words the new Primary Law has begun to do
business Every downtrodden Mokus owing 800 on a 500 House is honing
for a Chance to Hand it to somebody wearing a SealSkin Overcoat From
now on seek Contentment Rural Quietude and a cinch Rate of 5 Per
Cent on all your Holdings
So Ambition after leading him hither and yon finally conducted him
to the swell Country House surrounded by Oaks and winding Drives and
Sunken Gardens
Far from the HurlyBurly he settled down among his Boston Terriers and
Orchids and TalkingMachines and allowed Old Age to ripen and mellow
him into a Patriarch of the benevolent Pattern
At the suggestion of an expensive Specialist he went in for Golf
After he had learned to Follow Through and keep within 100 yards of
the Fair Green he happened to get mixed up in a Twosome one day with
a walking Rameses who had graduated from the Stock Exchange soon after
the Crime of 73 This doddering Shell of Humanity looked as if a High
Wind would blow him into the Crick When he swung at the Pill you
expected to hear something Snap
Our Hero had about 10 Years on the Ancient and it looked like a
Compote But the Antique managed to totter around the Course playing
short but safe always getting Direction and keeping away from the
Profanity Pits
He never caught up with Colonel Bogey but he had enough Class to trim
our Hero and collect 6 Balls
Ambition rode home with the unhappy Loser in the 12000 Limousine
Buck up Old Top said the faithful Prompter Fasten your Eye on
the Ball and dont try to Force He is sure to blow up sooner or
later Take another Lesson tomorrow morning and then publish your
Defi in the afternoon
He never had been strong enough to stand off Ambition So next Day he
took on Old SureThing again and got it in the same Place
No wonder The Octogenarian was of Scotch Descent He was the Color of
an Army Saddle He never smiled except when the Kilties came on tour
His Nippie consisted of a tall Glass about half full and then a little
Well Water
A plain American Business Man with a York State Ancestry had a fat
Chance against this Caledonian frameup
But that same persistent Ambition kept sending him back to the Ring to
take another Trouncing
One day he failed to show up at the Club House The Trained Nurse who
fanned him during the final Hours never suspected But the
CaddyMaster knew that he had died of a Broken Heart
MORAL Those who travel the hardest are not always the first to
arrive
THE NEW FABLE OF THE SPEEDY SPRITE
One Monday Morning a rangy and wellconditioned Elfin of the Young
Unmarried Set yclept Loretta emerged into the Sunlight and hit the
Concrete Path with a ringing Heel
This uncrowned Empress of the 18th Ward was a sheProgressive assaying
98 per cent pure Ginger
Instead of trailing the ever onward Parade she juggled the Baton at
the head of the Push
In the crisp introductory hours of the WashDay already woven into the
Plot Loretta trolleyed herself down into the Noise Belt
She went to the office of the exclusive Kennel Club and entered the
Chow KiYi for the next Bench Show At the Clearing House for K Ms
she filed a loud call for a Cook who could cook Then she cashed a
check ordered a pound of Salted Nuts to be delivered by Special
Wagon at once enveloped a ball of Ice Cream gooed with Chocolate
and soon greatly refreshed swept down on a Department Store
A Chenille Massacre was in full swing on the 3d floor just between
the Porch Furniture and Special Clothing for Airmen Loretta took a
run and jump into the heaving mass of the gentler Division She came
out at 1053 with her Sky Piece badly listed to Port and her toes
flattened out but she was 17 cents to the Good Three hearty Cheers
So she went over to an exhibition of Paintings breathing through her
Nose for at least an Hour as she studied the new Masterpieces of the
SwedoScandinavian School Each looked as if executed with a Squirt
Gun by a Nervous Geek on his way to a Three Days Cure Just the same
every Visitor with a clinging Skirt and a Mushroom Hat gurgled like a
Mountain Stream
In company with four other Seraphines plucked from the Society Col
she toyed with a Fruit Salad and Cocoa at a Tea Room instituted by a
Lady in Reduced Circumstances for the accommodation of those who are
never overtaken by Hunger
The usual Battle as to which should pick up the Check and the same old
Compromise A Dutch Treat with Waitress trying to spread it four ways
and the Auditing Committee watching her like a Hawk Then a 10cent
Tip bestowed as if endowing Princeton and the Quartet representing
the Flower of Americas Young Womanhood was once more out in the
Ozone marching abreast with shining Faces and pushing whitehaired
Business Men off into the Sweepings
Loretta went to a place with a glass Cover on it and had herself
photoed in many a striking Posture With the Chin tilted to show the
full crop of Cervical Vertebr and her Search Lights aimed yearningly
at the top of the Singer Building she had herself kidded into
believing that she was a certified Replica of Elsie Ferguson
As a member of the Board of Visitation she hurried out to the Colored
Orphan Asylum to check up the Picks and watch them making CardBoard
Mottoes
After that she had nothing to do except fly home and complete a Paper
on the Social Unrest in Spain after which she backed into the
Spangles because Father was bringing an old Stable Companion to
dinner
In the evening she took Mother to a Travel Lecture The colored Slides
were mingled with St Vitus Glimpses of swarming Streets and galloping
GeeGees They came home googleeyed and had to feel their way into
the Domicile
Tuesday AM dawned overcast with shifting winds from the NE
Loretta pried herself away from the third Waffle in order to hike to
the corner and jack up Mr Grocer about the Kindling Wood that he had
sent them for Celery
She had the Druggist phone the Florist and then rewarded him by
purchasing three Stamps
At 930 the Committee to arrange for the Summer Camp of the InWrong
Married Women whirled through the untidy Suburbs in a next years
Motor Car and Loretta was nowhere except right up on the front Seat
picking out the Road
Once a year the Ladies of the LumtyTum went out with their
embroidered SandBags and swung on their Gentlemen Friends for enough
Dough to pay the Vacation Expenses of Neglected Wives and Kiddies
In every community there is an undiscovered Triton thoroughly posted
on the Renaissance of the Reactionaries and the recrudescence of the
Big Six Baby with the uptwist that has Whiskers on it This Boy is so
busy regulating both Parties and both Leagues that when it comes time
for his Brood to take an Outing some ignorant Outsider has to step in
and unbelt
After letting contracts for Milk and Vegetables Loretta and the other
specimens of our Best People zipped over to the Country Club breaking
into silvery Laughter every time the Speedometer made a Face at the
SignBoard which said that the Speed Limit was 12 Miles an Hour
They showed a few milkfed Springers how to take a Joke and then
played an 18hole Foursome which was more or less of a Grewsome
Then a little Tea on the Terrace with Herbert lolling by in his
Flannels just as you read about it in Mrs Humphry Ward
A buzzing sound dying off into the distance a trail of Blue Smoke in
the fading Twilight and little Bright Eyes is back in her own Boudoir
packing herself into a new set of Glads
That evening she had four throbbing Roscoes curled up among her Sofa
Pillows
She had to bat up short and easy ones for this Bunch as they came
from the Wholesale District
When they began to distribute political Bromides the artful Minx sat
clear out on the edge of the Chair and let on to be simply popeyed
with Ardor
Shortly after 12 she turned the last nightblooming Cyril out into the
Darkness and did a graceful Pirouet to the Husks
On Wednesday morning between the Ham and Eggs she glanced at her
doubleentry Date Book and began to gyrate
On the way downtown she stopped in and had herself measured for a new
mop of Hair
Thence to the Beauty Works to have the peerless Frontispiece ironed
out and the Nails ivoried
When she appeared at the Sorority Tiffin at 1 PM she was dolled for
fair
The Response in behalf of the Alumnae of Yamma Gamma was a neat
Affair
After swiping the Table Decorations she and two Companions hurried to
a Mat It was a Performance given under the auspices of the
Overhanging Domes and the Drama was one that no Commercial Manager
had the Nerve to unload on the Public The Plot consisted of two
victims of Neurasthenia sitting at a Table and discussing Impaired
Circulation
That evening she helped administer the Anesthetic to a Seminary Snipe
who was getting into the Life Boat with a hardwood Bachelor grabbed
off at the 11th Hour
Loretta wept softly while straightening out the Veil in accordance
with Tradition Later on she did an Eddie Collins and landed the
Brides Bouquet At 1130 she had the Best Man backed into a Corner
slipping him that Old One about his Hair matching his Eyes
It is now Thursday morning and who is this in the Gym whanging the
Medicine Ball at the Lady Instructor with the Face
It is Loretta
Behold her at 1030 after an icy Splash and a keen rub with a raspy
Towel
She has climbed back into the darkcloth Effect and is headed for the
Studio of Madam to grapple with the French Lesson
After that she will do nothing before Lunch Time except try on White
Shoes and fondle some Hats that are being sacrificed at 80 per throw
The Suffrage Sisters rounded up Thursday afternoon A longitudinal
Brigadieress in the army of Intellectuality did the main Spiel with
Loretta as principal Rooter
The Speaker was there with the Pep and with the Vocabulary Otherwise
she was a NaughtyNaughty The costume was a plain Burial Shroud the
only Ornament being a 4carat Wen just above the Neckband
At 4 PM after the Male Sex had been ground to a Hamburger our
little Playmate escaped to a Picture Show but not until she had duly
fortified herself with the nourishing Marshmallow
There was nothing on the Cards that night except a Subscription Dance
which got under way at 10 PM and never subsided until the cold
Daylight began to spill in at the Windows
Loretta did 27 out of a possible 29 Percentage 931six better than
Bogey and 400 points ahead of Ty Cobb
Nevertheless and notwithstanding dont imagine that she failed to
come up for Air on Friday Morning
Life is real Life is earnest and she had a Gown to be shortened up
and resurveyed around the Horse Shoe Curve just as soon as she could
leave the Gloves to be cleaned
Happening into Automobile Row she permitted a blond salesman with a
Norfolk Jacket to demonstrate the new type of Electric Runabout
One of the most inexpensive pursuits of the welldressed Minority is
to glide over the Asphalt in a Demonstration car and pretend to be
undecided
She permitted the man to set her down at a Book Shop where she
furtively skinned eight Magazines while waiting for a Chum to pop
through the Whirligig Door
The two went WindowHopping for an hour After making Mind Purchases
of about 8000 worth of washable Finery edged with Lace a spirit of
Deviltry seized them
They ordered their Lettuce Sandwiches and diluted Ceylon in a
Restaurant where roguish MenaboutTown sat facing the Main Entrance
to pipe the pulchritudinous Pippins
Was it seven or eight Party Calls that she checked from her social
Ledger before 4 oclock Answer eight
Then a swinging Gallop for home Whilst she had been socializing
around Robert W Chambers had taken a lead of two Novels on her
Retiring to a quiet Alcove with four Volumes that were being dissected
at the drawingroom Clinics she took a hack at the first and last
Chapter of each Just enough to protect her against a Fumble if she
found herself next to a Book Sharp
That evening a famous Hungarian Fiddler accompanied by a warbling
Guinea Hen and backed up by sixty Symphonic Heineys wearing
Spectacles was giving a Recital for the True Lovers in a Mammoth Cave
devoted to Art
Loretta had a sneaking preference for the May Irwin School of
Expression but she had to go through with the SaintSaens Stuff now
and then to maintain a Club Standing
Accordingly she and Mother and poor old dying Father with no Heart in
the Enterprise were planted well down in Section B where they could
watch Mrs Leroy Geblotz who once entertained Nordica and say
Bravo at the Psychological Moment
On Saturday Morning after she had penned 14 Epistles using the tall
cuneiform Hieroglyphics she didnt have a blessed thing to do before
her 1 oclock Engagement except drop in at a Flower Show and a Cat
Show and have her Palm read by a perfectly fascinating Serpent with a
Goatee who had been telling all the Gells the most wonderful things
about themselves
A merry little Group went slumming Saturday afternoon They attended a
Ball Game Loretta had her Chin over the Railing and evinced a keen
Interest her only Difficulty being that she never knew which Side was
at bat
At dusk she began hanging on the Family Jewels It was a formal Dinner
Party with a list made up by Dun and Bradstreet
Loretta found herself between an extinct Volcano of Political World
and a sappy Fledgling whose Grandfather laid the cornerstone of
Brooklyn
The Dinner was one of those corpseless Funerals stagemanaged by a
respectable Lady with a granite Front who had Mayflower Corpuscles
moving majestically through her Arterial System
Loretta was marooned so far from the Live Ones that she couldnt
wigwag for Help Her CQD brought no Relief
She threw about three throes of Anguish before they escaped to the
private Gambling Hell
Here she tucked back her Valenciennes and proceeded to cop a little
PinMoney at the souldestroying game known as Bridge
At 1130 she led a highly connected volunteer Wine Pusher out into the
Conservatory and told him she did not think it advisable to marry him
until she had learned his First Name
Shortly after Midnight she blew arriving at headquarters just in time
to participate in a ChafingDish Jubilee promoted by only Brother
just back from the Varsity
She approached the Porcelain in a chastened mood that Sabbath morning
She was thinking of the Night Before and of playing cards for Money
She remembered the glare of Light from overhead and the tense eager
Faces peering above the PasteBoards
Then she recalled with a sharp catch of the Breath and a little tug
of Pain at the Heart that she had balled herself up at the one Stage
and got dummied out of a Grand Slam
