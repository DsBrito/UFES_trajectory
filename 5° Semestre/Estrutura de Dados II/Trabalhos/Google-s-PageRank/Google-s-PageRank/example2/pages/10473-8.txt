CHAPTER I
THE HORSE THIEF
It was a warm summer morning in the town of Farewell Save a dozen
horses tied to the hitchingrail in front of various saloons and the
Blue Pigeon Store and Bill Lainey the fat landlord of the hotel who
sat snoring in a reinforced telegraph chair on the sidewalk in the
shade of his wooden awning Main Street was a howling wilderness
Dust overlay everything It had not rained in weeks In the blacksmith
shop diagonally across the street from the hotel Piney Jackson was
shoeing a mule The mule was invisible but one knew it was a mule
because Piney Jackson has just come out and taken a twobyfour from
the woodpile behind the shop And it was a wellknown fact that Piney
never used a twobyfour on any animal other than a mule But this by
the way
In the barroom of the Happy Heart Saloon there were only two customers
and the bartender One of the former a brownhaired sunburnt young
man with ingenuous blue eyes was singing
Jog on jog on the footpath way
An merrily jump the stile O
Yore cheerful heart goes all the day
Yore sad tires in a mile O
Mr Racey Dawson having successfully sung the first verse rested
both elbows on the bar and grinned at the bartender That worthy
grinned back and knowing Mr Dawson slid the bottle along the bar
Have one yoreself Bill Mr Dawson nodded to the bartender
Whuwheres Swing Oh yeah
Mr Dawson head up chest out stepping high and walking very
stiffly as befitted a gentleman somewhat overserved with liquor
crossed the barroom to where bristlehaired Swing Tunstall sat on a
chair and slumbered his head on his arms and his arms on a table
Mr Dawson stooped and blew into Mr Tunstalls right ear Mr
Tunstall began to snore gently Growing irritated by this continued
indifference on the part of Mr Tunstall Mr Dawson seized the chair
by rung and back and incontinently dumped Mr Tunstall all abroad on
the saloon floor
Mr Tunstall promptly hitched himself into a corner and drifted deeper
into slumber
Mr Dawson turned a perplexed face on the bartender
Now what you gonna do with a feller like that Mr Dawson asked
plaintively
Mr Jack Richie manager of the Crossinabox ranch entering at the
moment temporarily diverted Mr Dawsons attention For Mr Dawson
had once ridden for the Crossinabox outfit Hence he was moved
literally to fall upon the neck of Mr Richie
Lean on yore own breakfast urged Mr Richie studiously dissembling
his joy at sight of his old friend and carefully steering Mr Dawson
against the bar Here I know what you need Drink hearty Racey
Son me declared Mr Dawson Everythins on me I guggot money
I have and I aim to spend it free an plenty cause theres more
where Im goin An I aint gonna earn it punchin cows neither
Dont do anything rash Mr Richie advised and took advantage of a
friends privilege to be insulting I helped lynch a roadagent only
last month
Which the huhholdup business is too easy for a live man opined Mr
Dawson We want somethin mummore diffdiffdiffcult me an Swing
do so were goin to Arizona where the gold grows No more wrastlin
cows No more hard work for us Were gonna get rich quick we are
What you laughin at
I never laugh denied Mr Richie When yore stakin out claims
dont forget me
We wont averred Mr Dawson solemnly Les have another
They had anotherseveral others
The upshot was that when Mr Richie who was the lucky possessor of
a head that liquor did not easily affect departed homeward at four
PM he left behind him a sadly plastered Mr Dawson
Mr Tunstall of course was still sleeping deeply and noisily
But Mr Dawson had long since lost interest in Mr Tunstall It is
doubtful whether he remembered that Mr Tunstall existed The two
had begun their party immediately after breakfast Mr Tunstall had
succumbed early but Mr Dawson had not once halted his efforts to
make the celebration a huge success So it is not a subject for
surprise that Mr Dawson some thirty minutes after bidding Mr Richie
an affectionate farewell should stagger out into the street and ride
away on the horse of someone else
The ensuing hours of the evening and the night were a merciful blank
to Mr Dawson His first conscious thought was when he awoke at dawn
on a sidehill a sharp rock prodding him in the small of the back and
the bridlereins of his dozing horse wound round one arm Only it was
not his horse His horse was a red roan This horse was a bay It
wasnt his saddle either
Wheres my hoss he demanded of the world at large and sat up
suddenly
The sharp movement wrung a groan from the depths of his being The
loss of his horse was drowned in the pains of his aching head Never
was such allpervading ache He knew the top was coming off He knew
it He could feel it and then didwith his fingers He groaned
again
His tongue was dry as cotton and it hurt him to swallow He stood up
but as promptly sat down In a whisperfor speech was torturehe
began to revile himself for a fool
I might have known it was his plaint I had a feelin when I took
that last glass it was one too many I never did know when to stop
Id like to know how I got here and where my hoss is and who belongs
to this one
He eyed the mount with disfavour He had never cared for bays
An that aint much of a saddle either he went on with his
soliloquy Cheap saddlelooks like a boys saddlean a old
saddlebet Noah used one just like ittry to rope with that saddle
an youd pull the horn to hellen gone Wonder whats in that
saddlepocket
He pulled himself erect slowly and tenderly His knees were very
shaky His head throbbed like a squeezed boil buthe wanted to learn
what was in that saddlepocket Possibly he might obtain therein a
clue to the horses owner
He slipped the strap of the pocketflap flipped it open inserted his
fingers and drew forth a small package wrapped in newspaper and tied
with the blue string affected by the Blue Pigeon Store in Farewell
Mr Dawson balanced the package on two fingers for a reflective
instant then he snapped the string and opened the package
Socks an a undershirt he said disgustedly and started to say
more but paused for there was something queer about that undershirt
His head was still spinning and his eyes were sandy but he perceived
quite plainly that there were narrow blue ribbons running round the
neck of that undershirt He unrolled the socks and found them much
longer in the leg than the kind habitually worn by men Mr Dawson
agitatedly dived his hand once more into the saddlepocket And this
time he pulled out a tortoiseshell shuttle round which was wrapped
several inches of lingerie edging But Mr Dawson did not call it
lingerie edging He called it tatting and swore again
That settles it he said cheerlessly Ive stole some womans
cayuse
CHAPTER II
THE YELLOW DOG
It was a chastened Racey Dawson that returned to Farewell He went
directly to the blacksmith shop
Lo Hoss Thief was Piney Jacksons cheerful greeting
Whose is it demanded Racey Dawson wiping his hot face Whose hoss
have I stole
Oh youll catch it chuckled the humorous Piney Yep you betcha
Youve got a gall you have Camly prancing out of a saloon an
glooming onto a ladys hoss What kind o doins is that Id like to
know
You blasted idjit cried the worried Racey Whose hoss is this
I kind o guessed maybe something disgraceful like this here would
happen when I seen you and yore friend sashay into the Happy Heart
And the barkeep said you had two snifters and a glass o milk too
Honest Racey youd oughta be more careful how you mix yore drinks
Dont try to be a bigger jack than you are Racey adjured him in
a tone that he strove to make contemptuous You think yore awful
funnyjust too awful funny dont you Im askin you you fishfaced
ape whose hoss this is I got here
Dont you know grinned Piney elevating both eyebrows Lordy I
wouldnt be in yore shoes for something Nawsir Shell snatch you
baldheaded she will The old lady was wild when she come out an
found her good hoss missing And she shore said what she thought of
you some more when she seen she had to ride home on that old crows
dinner of a motheaten accordeen you left behind
Racey Dawson was too reduced in spirit to properly take umbrage at
this insult to his horse He could only repeat his request that Piney
make not of himself a bigger fool than usual And when Piney did
nothing but laugh immoderately Racey grinned foolishly
If my head didnt ache so hard he assured the chortling blacksmith
Id shore talk to you butSay lookit here Piney quit yore
foolin will you Who owns this hoss anyway
Here comes Kansas said Piney Betcha five even he arrests you for
a hoss thief
Gimme odds an Ill go you Racey returned promptly
Even stuck out Piney
Naw he might do it You Farewell jiggers hang together too hard for
me to take any chances Lo Kansas
Howdy Racey nodded Kansas Casey the deputy sheriff How long you
been rustlin hosses
A damsight longern I like Racey replied frankly Who does own
this hoss
Y oughta asked that question yesterday said Kansas severely but
with a twinkle in his black eyes that belied his tone This here
would be mighty serious business for you if the Sheriff was in town
Jakes so particular about being legal an all Yessir Racey
oldtimer I expect youd spend some time in the calabooseif you
wasnt lynched previous
Dont scare the poor feller pleaded Piney in a tone of deepest
compassion Hell be cryin in a minute
In a minute Ill be doing somethin besides cry if you fellers dont
stop yore funning This here is past a joke this is and
Shore its past a joke Kansas concurred warmly an I aint
funning not for a minute You go give that hoss back Racey or
youll be sorry
Well for Gawds sake tell me who to give it back to bawled Racey
and immediately batted his eyes and gingerly patted the back of his
head
Head ache queried Kansas I expect it might after last night You
go give that hoss back like a good boy
So saying Kansas Casey turned his back and retreated rapidly in the
direction of the Starlight Saloon
Racey Dawson glared vindictively after the departing deputy Then he
switched his angry blue eyes to the blacksmiths smiling countenance
You can all said Racey Dawson distinctly go plumb to hell
He turned the purloined pony on a dime and loped up the street
followed by the ribald laughter of Piney Jackson
They think theyre so terrible funny Racey muttered mournfully
as he dismounted and tied at the hitching rail in front of the Happy
Heart Now if I can only find Swing
But Swing Tunstall it appeared on consulting the bartender had gone
off hunting him Racey The latter did not appeal to the bartender to
divulge the name of the horses owner He had he believed furnished
the local populace sufficient amusement for one day He had a small
drink for he felt that he needed a bracer and with the liquor he
imbibed inspiration
Miss Blythe Mike Flynns partner in the Blue Pigeon Store She would
know whose horse it was for certainly the horses owner had bought
the undershirt and the stockings at the Blue Pigeon Furthermore
Miss Blythe looked like a rightminded individual She would take no
pleasure in devilling a man Not she
Racey Dawson set down his glass and hurried to the Blue Pigeon Store
Miss Blythe at his entrance ceased checking tomato cans and came
forward
Maam said Racey will you come to the door a minute No no
dont be scared he added as the lady drew back a step Im kind
of in trouble an I want you to help me out Immy names Racey
Dawson an I used to ride for the Crossinabox before I got a job
up at the Bend Jack Richie knows me I aint crazyhonest
For Miss Blythe continued to look doubtful I she began
Lookit he interrupted yesterday I got a heap drunk an I rode off
on somebodys hoss without meaning toI mean I thought it was my hoss
and it wasnt An I thought maybe youd tell me who the hoss belongs
to sos I can return him and get mine back She took mine they tell
me Not that I blame her a mite he added hastily
Pretty Miss Blythe smiled suddenly I did hear something about a
switch in horses yesterday afternoon she admitted But I thought
Mr Flynn said Tom Dowling was the mans name Certainly I remember
you now Mr Dawson although at first youryour beard
Yeah I know he put in hurriedly I aint shaved since I left the
Bend and I slept mostly on my face last night but its lil ol me
all right behind the whiskers and real estate Yeah thats the hoss
yonderthe one next the pinto
I know the horse said Miss Blythe drawing back from the doorway
It belongs to the Dales over at Medicine Spring on Soogan Creek
Oh I know them Racey declared confidently he had been at the
Dales precisely once The girl married Chuck Morgan Shore Mis
Dales hoss huh Ill take it right back soons I get shaved I
spose Ill have a jomightyful time explaining it to the old lady
It isnt the mothers horse Its the daughters She was in town
yesterday
You mean Chucks wife Mis Morgan
I mean Miss Molly Dale the other daughter
I didnt know they had another daughter puzzled Racey thinking of
what Piney Jackson had said anent an old lady They must a kept
her in the background when I was there that time What is shea old
maid
Oh middleaged perhaps was the straightfaced reply
Shucks I might have known it grumbled Racey middleaged old
maid I know what theyre like I had one once for a schoolteacher I
can feel her lickings yet She was the contrariest female I ever met
Shucks IWell if I gotta I gotta Mights well get it over with
now as later Thanks maam for helping me out
Racey Dawson shambled dejectedly forth to effect the feeding of Miss
Molly Dales horse at the hotel corral For his own breakfast he went
to Sing Lueys Canton Restaurant Because while Bill Lainey offered
no objections to feeding the horse Mrs Lainey utterly refused to
provide snacks at odd hours for goodfornothing stickabed punchers
who were too lazy to eat at the regular mealtime So there now
But I aint gonna shave he told himself as he disposed of fried
steak and potatoes sloshed down by several cups of coffee If shes a
old maid like they say it dont matter how tough I look
He was reflectively stirring the grounds in the bottom of his sixth
cup when a small and frightened yellow dog dashed into the restaurant
and fled underneath Raceys table where he cowered next to Raceys
boots and cuddled a lopeared head against Raceys knee
Racey had barely time to glance down and discover that the yellow
nondescript was no more than a pup when a burly youth charged into
the restaurant and demanded in no uncertain tones to know where that
adjective dog had hidden himself
Racey took an instant dislike to the burly youth stillit was his
dog And it is a custom of the country to let every man as the saying
is skin his own deer He that takes exception to this custom and
horns in on what cannot rightfully be termed his particular business
will find public opinion dead against him and his journey unseasonably
full of incident
Racey moved a leg This him stranger
The burly youth it was evident that he was not wholly sober glared
at Racey Dawson Shore its him he declared Whatell you hidin
him for Get outa the way
Whereupon the burly youth advanced upon Racey
This was different Oh quite The burly youth had by his brusque
manner and rude remarks included Racey in his the burly youths
business
Racey met the burly youth rather more than halfway He hit him so hard
on the nose that the other flipped backward through the doorway and
landed on his ear on the sidewalk
Racey followed him out The burly youth bleeding copiously from the
nose sat up and fumbled uncertainly for his gun
No said Racey with decision aiming his sixshooter at the word
You leave that gun alone and lemme tell you stranger while were
together that I want to buy that pup of yores A gent like you aint
fit company for a selfrespecting dog to associate with Nawsir
You got the drop grumbled the burly youth
Which is one on you Racey observed goodhumouredly
Maybe Ill be seein you again suggested the other
Dont lemme see you first advised Racey Never mind getting up
Just sit nice and quiet like a good boy and keep the lil hands
spread out all so pretty with the thumbs locked over yore head Ats
the boy How much for yore dog feller
What you done to my dog A womans voice broke on Raceys ears But
he did not remove his slightly narrowed eyes from the face of the
burly youth
What you done to my dog The question was repeated and the speaker
came close to the burly youth and looked down at him Now that the
woman was within his range of vision Racey perceived that she was the
Happy Heart lookout a goodlooking creature with brown hair and a
lithe figure
The girls fists were clenched so tightly that her knuckles showed
whitely against the pink Two red spots flared on the white skin of
her cheeks
Dam yore soul swore the lady I want my dog How many tunes I
gotta ask you huh Where is he Say somethin you dumb lump of slum
gullion
He aint yore dog denied the burly youth He never was yores Hes
mine you
Which last was putting it pretty strongly even for the time the
place and the girl She promptly swung a brisk right toe kicked the
burly youth under the chin and flattened him out
Thatll learn you to call me names she snarled So long as I act
like a lady Im agonna be treated like one and Ill break the neck
of the man who acts different and you can stick a pin in that you
dirtymouthed beast
Muttering profanely true to form the aforementioned beast essayed to
rise But here again Racey and his ready gun held him to the ground in
a sitting position
You leave her alone commanded Racey You got what was coming to
yuh Let it go at that The lady says its her dog anyway
Its my dog I tell yuh I
Yore a liar averred the girl You kicked the dog out when he was
sick and I took him in and tended him and got him well If that dont
make him my dog what does
Correct said Racey Call him
The girl put two fingers in her mouth and whistled shrilly Forth from
the Canton came the dog on the jump and bounced into the girls arms
and began to lick her ear with despatch and enthusiasm
You see how it is Racey indicated to the man on the ground Its
the ladys dog You can go now
The burly youth stared stupidly
You heard what I said Racey told him impatiently Gon Go
someers else Get outa here
Say remarked the burly youth in what was intended to be a menacing
growl this party aint over yet
Aint you been enough of a fool already today interrupted Racey
You aint asking for it are you
You cant run no blazer on me denied the other furiously
Racey promptly holstered his sixshooter Nows yore best time he
said quietly
When the smoke cleared away there was a rent in the sleeve of Raceys
shirt and the burly youth sat rocking his body to and fro and groaning
through gritted teeth For there was a redhot hole in his right
shoulder which hurt him considerably
Racey Dawson gazed dumbly down at the muzzle of his sixshooter from
which a slim curl of gray smoke spiralled lazily upward Then his eyes
veered to the man he had shot and to the mans sixshooter lying on the
edge of the sidewalk It too like his own gun was thinly smoking at
the muzzle The burly youth put a hand to his shoulder The fingers
came away red Racey was glad he had not killed him He had not
intended to But accidents will happen
He stepped forward and kicked the burly youths discarded sixshooter
into the middle of the street He looked about him The girl and her
dog had vanished
Kansas Casey had taken her place apparently From windows and doorways
along the street peered interested faces One knew that they were
interested despite their careful lack of all expression It is never
well to openly express approval of a shooting The shooter undoubtedly
has friends and little breaches of etiquette are always remembered
Racey Dawson looked at Kansas Casey and shoved his sixshooter down
into its holster
It was an even break announced Racey
Shore Kansas nodded I seen it Therell be no troublefrom us
he added significantly
The deputy sheriff knelt beside the wounded man Racey Dawson went
into the Happy Heart He felt that he needed a drink When he came out
five minutes later the burly youth had been carried away Remained a
stain of dark red on the sidewalk where he had been sitting Piggy
Wadsworth the plump owner of the dancehall legs widespread and arms
akimbo was inspecting the red stain thoughtfully He was joined by
the storekeeper Calloway and two other men None of them was aware
of Racey Dawson standing in front of the Happy Heart
Was it there inquired Calloway
Yeah said Piggy Right there I seen the whole fraycas Racey
stood here an
At this point Racey Dawson went elsewhere
CHAPTER III
THE TALL STRANGER
Youll have to manage it yoreself Lanpher the manager of the 88
ranch was speaking and there was finality in his tone
You mean you dont wanna appear in the deal atall sneered his
companion
Racey Dawson who had been kneeling on the ground engaged in bandaging
a cut from a kick on the near foreleg of the Dale pony when the two
men led their horses into the corral craned his neck past the ponys
chest and glanced at Lanphers tall companion For the latters words
provoked curiosity What species of deal was toward Having ridden for
Lanpher in the days preceding his employment by the Crossinabox
and consequently provided with many opportunities for studying the
gentleman at armslength Racey naturally assumed that the deal was a
shady one Personally he believed Lanpher capable of anything
Which of course was unjust to the manager His courage was not quite
sufficient to hold him abreast of the masters in wickedness But he
was mean and cruel in a slimy way and if left alone was prone to make
life miserable for someone Invariably the someone was incapable of
proper defense From Farewell to Marysville throughout the length
and breadth of the great Lazy River country Lanpher was known
unfavourably and disliked accordingly
To his companions sneering remark Lanpher made no intelligible reply
He merely grunted as he reached for the gate to pull it shut His
companion half turned his back had from the first been toward
Racey Dawson and Racey perceived the cold and Roman profile of a
longjawed head Then the man turned full in his direction and behold
the hard features vanished and the man displayed a goodlooking
countenance of singular charm The chin was a thought too wide and
heavy a trait it shared in common with the mouth but otherwise the
strangers full face would have found favour in the eyes of almost any
woman however critical
Racey Dawson at first minded to reveal his presence in the corral
thought better of it almost immediately While not by habit an
eavesdropper he felt no shame in fortuitously overhearing anything
Lanpher or the stranger might be moved to say Lanpher merited no
consideration under any circumstances and the stranger in appearance
a similar breed of dog as far as morals went certainly deserved no
better treatment So Racey remained quietly where he was and was glad
that besides the pony to whom he was ministering there were several
others between him and the men at the gate
Why dont you wanna appear in this business persisted the stranger
pivoting on one heel in order to keep face to face with Lanpher
I gotta live here was the Lanpher reply
Well aint I gotta live here too and I dont see anything round
here to worry me Spose old Chin Whisker does go on the prod What
can he do
Tsall right mumbled Lanpher shutting the gate and shoving home
the bar You dont know this country as well as I do I got trouble
enough running the 88 without borrowing any more
Now I told you I was gonna get his lil ranch peaceable if I could I
got it all planned out I dont do anything rough unless I gotto But
Im gonna get old Chin Whisker out o there and you can stick a pin
in that
Tsall right Tsall right You wanna remember ol Chin Whisker aint
the only hoss yore trying to ride If you think that other outfit
is gonna watch you pick daisies in their front yard without doing
anything you got another guess But Ill do what I saidand no
more
I spose you think that by sticking away off yonder where the grass
is long nobody will suspicion you If you do yore crazy Folks aint
so crossbrained as all that
Not so dam loud Lanpher cautioned excitedly
Say whatsa matter with you demanded the stranger leaning back
against the gate and spreading his long arms along the top bar Which
yore the most nervous gent I ever did see The hotel aint close
enough for anybody to hear a word and theres only hosses in the
corral Get ahold of yoreself Dont be so skittish
I aint skittish Im sensible I know Lanpher broke off abruptly
What do you know
What yore due to find out
Now lookit here Mr Lanpher said the stranger in a low cold tone
you said those last words a leetle too gayful to suit me If yore
planning any skulduggerydont
I aint Not a bit of it But I got my duty to my company I cant
get mixed up in any fraycas on yore account because if I do my ranch
will lose money Thats the flat of it
Oh it is huh Yore ranch will lose money if you back me up hey
And you aint thinkin nothin of yore precious skin are yuh Oh
no not atall I wonder what yore company would say to the lil deal
between you and me that started this business I wonder what theyd
think of Mr Lanpher and his sense of duty Yeah I would wonder a
whole lot
Well began Lanpher lamely
Hell snarled the stranger You make me sick Now you listen to me
Yore in this as deep as I am If you think you aint try to pull
yore wagon out Just try it thassall
I aint doing none of the work thats flat Lanpher denied
doggedly
You gotta back me up alla same declared the stranger
That wasnt in the bargain fenced Lanpher
It is now chuckled the stranger If I lose you lose too
Lookit he added in a more conciliatory tone cant you see how it
is I need you an you need me All Im asking of you is to back
me up when I want you to Outside of that you can sit on yore
shoulderblades and enjoy life
We didnt bargain on that harked back Lanpher
But that was then and this is now Which may not be logic but it
is necessity an Necessity Mr Lanpher is the mother of all kinds
of funny things So you and I we got to ride together
Lanpher pushed back his hat and looked over the hills and far away
The wellknown carking care was written large upon his countenance
Slowly his eyes slid round to meet for a brief moment the eyes of his
companion
I cant answer for my men said Lanpher shortly
Can you answer for yoreself inquired the stranger quickly
Ill back you up Grudgingly
Then thats all right You can keep the men from throwing in with the
other side anyway cant you
I can do that much
