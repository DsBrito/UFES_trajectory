The grand total of stones included in the temples and avenues was
650 in the original temples 188
In Aubreys time AD 1663          73 stones
In Dr Stukeleys time AD 1722    29
In 1815                              17
Of very late years says Sir Richard Colt Hoare I do not imagine the
dilapidations of the temple have been very great
It should however be mentioned that the tracing of the snake form
is due to Dr Stukeley for his predecessor Aubrey mentions the avenue
as a solemn walk leading to a monument upon the top of the hill
without any allusion to the supposed design or its connexion with the
Grand Temple at Abury
It is a matter of greater speculation than we can here enter into
as to the date and founders of Abury and their history is as
dislocated as are the masses of its ruins Antiquarians agree on the
purpose for which it was founded viz for the performance of the
religious ceremonies of the Druids Sir R Colt Hoare illustrates this
point by supposing the flat ledge projecting from the vallum to have
been intended for the accommodation of sitting to the spectators who
resorted hither to the public festivals and adds he what a grand and
imposing spectacle must so extensive and elevated an amphitheatre
have presented the vallum and its declivities lined with spectators
whilst the hallowed area was preserved for the officiating Druids and
perhaps the higher order of the people
Gentle Reader be ye lordling or lowlier born once more turn back to
the engraving We have a subject of yesterday rife and ready for you
on the next page but turn to the engraving Look again at those
circles and the fantastic forms that compose them and think of the
infatuated thousands that were wont to assemble round them and of the
idolized sons of power that once stood within their hallowed area
Think of those days of sacrifice and superstitionthose orgies of
ignorance and barbarismand contrast them with the happy happy
age of religious liberty in which it is your boast and blessing to
liveand then you may read sermons in stones to the masterminds of
your own time To us the stones of Abury are part of the poetry of
savage life and of more interest than all the plaster toys of these
days But they may not be so with you and FINIS We were once
compensated for missing Fonthill and its finery by witnessing
daybreak from Salisbury Plain and associating its glories with the
timeworn relics of STONEHENGE
The engraving and data are from Mr Higginss Celtic Druids for
the loan of which and a portion of this article we thank our friend
JAMES SILVESTER whose valuable note on Circular Temples must
stand over for our next
We had penciled for our Supplement the following beautiful lines from
Mr Wattss Literary Souvenir but they will be more in place here
Silbury is an immense mound adjoining the road to Devizes and
opposite Abury Sir RC Hoare thinks it part of Abury but H and
many others think it the sepulchre of a King or ArchDruid
SILBURY HILL
Grave of Cunedha were it vain to call
For one wild lay of all that buried lie
Beneath thy giant mound From Taras hall
Faint warblings yet are heard faint echoes die
Among the Hebrides the ghost that sung
In Ossians ear yet wails in feeble cry
On Morvern but the harmonies that rung
Around the grove and cromlech never more
Shall visit earth for ages have unstrung
The Druids harp and shrouded all his lore
Where under the worlds ruin sleep in gloom
The secrets of the floodthe letterd store
Which Seths memorial pillars from the doom
Preserved not when the sleep was Natures tomb
H
FINE ARTS
For the Mirror
The way to be an excellent painter is to be an
excellent manand these united make a character
that would shine even in a better world
than thisJONATHAN RICHARDSON
The sister arts of Painting and Engraving have been making great
progress in England for some time past and we are disposed to think
this a subject of congratulation and importance to all classes of the
community
The literature of the Fine Arts is likewise becoming more and more
popular every day They form a prominent feature in every new literary
project and not unfrequently literature to use a hackneyed phrase
is made their vehiclelike the nambypamby of an English opera
for the strains of Rossini or Weber The public are contented with
excellence in one department and mediocrity in the other they cannot
be constantly admiringthat is out of the questionand it is
probably on this account that much of what appears below par is
tolerated and even encouraged
We will not go the length of assenting to the proposal of converting
Sir Joshua Reynoldss Lectures into Sermons by the mere alteration of
the terms of art into scriptural phraseology but we venture to assert
that much national good is likely to result from these advances of
art and its constant introduction into all our amusements That it
promotes the growth of virtue is too old an axiom to be refuted
Ingenuas didicisse fideliter artes
Emollit mores nec sinit esse feros
The Italians commonly call a taste for the fine arts or skill in
them by the name of Virtue They term the productions of artists
objects of virtue and a person who has a taste for such things is
denominated a virtuoso that is a virtuous man Such is the
language of the Edinburgh Review in commencing an article on a
recentlypublished translation of Lanzis History of Painting in
Italy in six octavo volumesand what a delightful relief is this
from the party declamations which usually occupy so large a portion of
that critical journal But this is not singular for it is now no
uncommon thing to see a large letter column of a newspaper and a
similar proportion of a printed sheet published at twopence alike
occupied by the Fine Arts
Patronage royal and noble has already achieved much for painting
and even the reported project for a National Gallery does much to
foster the art It keeps the study afloat and uppermost in the public
mind and the immense increase of exhibitions not only in London but
in provincial towns serves to prove that patronage now consists in
something more substantial than tutelar notice and unpaid promises
Artists need no longer journey to the metropolis to find sale for
their works for their genius is nourished on its native soil by the
liberality and good taste which abound in the neighbourhood of every
important town in the empire It may be as well to keep up the hue and
cry about the folly of portraitpainting if it be only to keep down
the vanity of wealth but the munificent rewards which painters
receive for this branch of their art will enable them to devote a
greater portion of their leisure to higher studies Their taste
will not thus be impugned for Cooke the actor is known to have
entertained the meanest opinion of his own performance of Richard
the Third as an historical portrait notwithstanding it was the
cornerstone of his fame We do not invite the comparison but Mr
Hayden began with historyhis want of patronage is well known he
then tried portraitsbut his want of success was reserved for the
style of his Mock Election pictures and in all probability they
will turn out the philosophers stone for his future life
But it is to the splendid union of Painting Engraving and Literature
that much of these beneficial effects may be traced In every branch
of the fine arts and literature what a powerful influence will this
triple advancement produce Only compare the topographical works of
Mr Britton with those of his predecessorshis highlyfinished
line engravings excellent antiquarian pieces on wood and erudite
descriptions with the wretched prints and the quaintnesses of old
topographersor even with the lumber of some of our county
histories With this improvement and that of mapwork painting has
comparatively but little to do and yet how evident is the progress of
the literature of these works2
It would be easy to adduce hundreds of instances of the recent union
of painting and engraving About five years ago a plan was started
for illustrating the Bible from pictures of the old masters Upwards
of two hundred of them were transferred to woodblocks but the scheme
did not repay the ingenious originatorpartly from their small size
uncertainty of effect to be produced on wood and partly from the
very cheap rate at which the engravings were soldthe whole series
being purchaseable for three or four shillings3 But a similar
design is now in progress on metal being the idea of La Musee in
little It consists of beautiful outline copies of the great
masters published at so cheap a rate as to be within the reach of
a schoolboy Within the present year also two series of Views in
Great Britain one of Views in London and another of Paris have been
publishing at the rate of threepence for each view and when we see
among their artists the names of Westall Pugin and Pye we have a
sufficient voucher for their excellence
A passing notice of a few of the more splendid works of art for the
above are among the cheap and popular projects of the day and we
must conclude
2 The only place in which they do not progress mutually is the
theatre Look at the scenery of our patent theatres and compare
it with the vulgar daubs even of John Kembles time Some of the
scenes by Stanfield Roberts Grieve and Pugh are perfect
pictures Yet the language of the stage is at a stand and
insipid comedy dull tragedy and stupid farce are more abundant
than before the march of mind
3 While on the subject of woodengraving perhaps we may he
allowed to mention our own humble plan of illustrating a sheet
of letterpress for twopence Of course perfection in the
engraving department would have ruined all parties concerned
for each of our subjects as the miniature painters tell you of
their works might be worked up to any price It is now six
years since the MIRROR was commenced and as we are not speaking
of ourselves individually we hope we may refer to the
progressive improvement of the graphic department without any
charge of vanity
It would be tedious to enumerate even a small portion of the fine
pictures which have been engraved during the last two years the
mention of two or three will answer our purpose Every printsellers
window will attest the fact Only let the reader step into Mr
Colnaghis parlours in Cockspurstreet and we might say the spacious
print gallery in Pall Mall There let him turn over a few of the host
of fine portraits which have been transferred from the canvass to the
copperthe excellent series of royal portraitsand of men whose
names will shine in the history of their country when their portraits
shall be gathered into the portfolios of a few collectors Among
portraits we ought however to recollect Mr Lodges invaluable
collection of historical characters the originals of which were
exhibited a few months since previous to their republication in a
more economical form The Temple of Jupiter published a few months
since is perhaps one of the proudest triumphs of the year Martins
Deluge too has lately appeared and we look forward to the
publication of his last splendid picture the Fall of Nineveh with
high hopes
In the SUPPLEMENTARY NUMBER4 published with the present we have
noticed in detail a few of the many superb engravings which embellish
the Christmas presents for the ensuing year as well as their literary
talent by a string of extracts like
Orient pearls at random strung
The success of these elegant works has benefited our artists to the
sum of twelve thousand pounds in their preparation for 1829 A
fortnight since we mentioned the cost of the plates of the Literary
Souvenir to be 100l and upwards for each subject Another work
still more splendid being nearly double the price is under the
direction of Mr Charles Heath whose masterly hand is visible in some
of the finest engraving ever submitted to the worldequalled only by
a rival in its first yearone of the best proofs of the patronage
these works enjoy It would be invidious to particularizebut we must
mention the transference of two of Martins designsMarcus Curtius
in the Forget Me Not and Christ Tempted on the Mountas two of the
most surprising efforts of genius we have ever witnessed Our readers
need not be told that all the engravings are on steel and were it
not for the adoption of this lasting metal the
4 The engraving is from Prouts exquisite picture of the
magnificent city of Vicenzafor which we recollect our
obligation to the Forget Me Not
cost of half the engravings would exceed that of the whole work all
we hope is that the public patronage may be as lasting as the metal
then it will be no idle vaunt to call this the march or even race of
genius In conclusion we recommend all our lady friends who have
not done so to place on their drawingroom table a Print Album or
Scrap Book to be supported by voluntary contributions They may
then form a pretty correct estimate of the taste of their visiters
and if taste in the fine arts be a test of virtue and integrity they
may even settle the claims of any two rival aspirants by this fair and
unerring method which should admit of no appeal
ANECDOTES OF CHRISTINA THE YOUNG QUEEN OF SWEDEN
For The Mirror
Christina was the only child of the great Gustavus Adolphus who
succeeded to the throne of her father in 1632 when she was but five
years of age The young queen at an early age discovered but little
taste for the society and occupations of her sex When young she was
capable of reading the Greek historians At the age of eighteen she
assumed the reins of government Several princes of Europe aspired
to her hand but she rejected them all To prevent a renewal of
applications on this subject she solemnly appointed Gustavus her
successor but without the smallest participation in the rights of
the crown during her own life During her minority Sweden enjoyed
internal repose but was involved in a long war with the German
empire She was crowned with great splendour in the year 1650 From
this time she entertained a philosophical contempt for pomp and
parade and a kind of disgust for the affairs of state She invited to
her court men of the first reputation in various studies She was a
great collector of books manuscripts medals paintings c In 1654
when she was only in her 28th year Christina abdicated the crown
in order that she might live a life of freedom With her crown she
renounced the Lutheran and embraced the Catholic religion In quitting
the scene of her regal power she proceeded to Rome where she
intended to fix her abode Some disgust which she received at Rome
induced her in the space of two years to determine to visit France
Here she was treated with respect by Louis XIV but the ladies were
shocked with her masculine appearance and demeanour and the unguarded
freedom of her conversation Apartments were assigned her at
Fontainbleau where she committed an action which has indelibly
stained her memory and for which in other countries says her
biographer she would have paid the forfeit of her own life This was
the murder of an Italian Monaldeschi her master of the horse who
had betrayed some secret intrusted to him He was summoned into a
gallery in the palace letters were then shown to him at the sight of
which he turned pale and entreated for mercy but he was instantly
stabbed by two of her own domestics in an apartment adjoining that in
which she herself was The French court was justly offended at this
atrocious deed yet it met with vindicators among whom was Leibnitz
whose name was disgraced by the cause which he attempted to justify
Christina was sensible that she was now regarded with horror in
France and would gladly have visited England but she received no
encouragement for that purpose from Cromwell She returned to Rome
and resumed her amusements in the arts and sciences In 1660 on the
death of Charles Gustavus she took a journey to Sweden to recover her
crown but her ancient subjects rejected her claims and submitted to
a second renunciation of the throne after which she returned to Rome
Some differences with the pope made her resolve in 1662 once more
to return to Sweden but the conditions annexed by the senate to her
residence there were now so mortifying that she proceeded no farther
than Hamburgh She went back to Rome and cultivated a correspondence
with the learned men there and in other parts of Europe and died in
1689 leaving behind her many letters a Collection of Miscellaneous
Thoughts or Maxims and Reflections on the Life and Actions of

METHOD OF ASCERTAINING THE STATE OF THE LUNGS
For The Mirror
Persons desirous of ascertaining the true state of their lungs are
directed to draw in as much breath as they conveniently can they are
then to count as far as they are able in a slow and audible voice
without drawing in more breath The number of seconds they can
continue counting must be carefully observed in a consumption the
time does not exceed ten and is frequently less than six seconds in
pleurisy and pneumonia it ranges from nine to four seconds When the
lungs are in a sound condition the time will range as high as from
twenty to thirtyfive seconds

THE COSMOPOLITE
ARTISTICAL ERRORS
A SECOND CHAPTER OF BULLS
For The Mirror
I saw a picture not long since in Edinburgh copied from an engraving
in Boydells Shakspeare subjectLear and suite in the storm
but coloured according to the imagination and taste of the artist its
name ought assuredly to have been Redcap and the bluedevils for
the venerable and lamented monarch had fine streaming locks of the
real carrot hue whilst his very hideous companions showed blue
faces and blue armour and with their strangely contorted bodies
seemed meet representatives of some of the infernal courtIn a
highly adorned prayer book published in the reign of William
III the engravings of which are from silverplates one print
illustrates our Lords simile of the mote and beam by a couple of men
aiming at each others visual organs ineffectually enough one having
a great log of wood growing from his eye and the other being blind
in one eye from a cataract at least though I think I do not err
in saying a moat and castle in itI have seen an old edition of
Jeremy Taylors Life and Death of Christ illustrated with many
remarkably good engravings Of one of these the subject is the
Impotent Man at the Pool of Bethesda the fore ground is occupied by
our Saviour the cripple and other invalids and in the distance
appears a small pond palisaded by slender pilasters over it hovers
an angel who with a long pole is to the marvel of the beholders
dexterously troubling the waters In the same volume some of the
figures are clad in the garb of the time when drawn and St Jude is
reading the New Testament in a pair of spectaclesIn Holyrood
House and in one of the rooms added in the days of Charles II is a
panelpainting of the Infant Hercules strangling the serpents and
leaping up in front of the cradle appears one of those pretty and
rare spaniels called King Charless breed In the same palace and
in one of the chambers once occupied by the unfortunate Mary is
a very old painting intended as the guide assures visitors to
represent St Peters vision of the great sheet it may be but if so
one archangel in military sandals holding in his hands a small
towel represents by a figure in painting I presume St Peter
the sheet and its innumerable living contents He must have taken a
hint from the artist who painted for the passage through the Red Sea
nothing but ocean assuring his employer that the Israelites could
not be seen because they were all gone over and the Egyptians were
every one drownedI once saw writes a friend a full length
portrait of Wordsworth in a modern painting of Christ riding into
Jerusalem it was amongst a group of Jews and next to a likeness
of Voltaire I believe the painter intended to contrast the
countenances of the Christian and infidel poets and thus pay a
handsome compliment to the former but the taste that placed the
ancients and moderns together remind me of a fine old painting of the
Flemish school a David with Goliahs head in the foreground of
which were a number of fat Dutchmen dressed in blue coats and
leather breeches with pipes in their mouthsRaphael says a
little French work on painting in my possession speaking of unity
of time A peche contre cette regle dans son tableau dHeliodore
ou il fait intervenir le Pape Jules 2 dans le Temple de Jerusalem
porte sur les epaules des Gonfalonniers The same work notices a
breach of the unity of design in Paul Veronese qui dans la partie
droite dun de ses tableaux a represente Jesus Christ benissant
leau dont il va etre baptise par St Jean Baptiste et dans la
partie gauche notre Seigneur tente par le diableUpon the
celebrated Transfiguration of Raphael I heard an artist remark
undoubtedly it is the first picture in the world yet the painter has
erred in these respectsthe upper portion of the picture is occupied
by the subject but the lower and foreground by the Healing of
the Demoniac Now that event did not happen until after the
transfiguration and we infringe upon our Saviours ubiquity by
supposing it to occur contrary to the sacred story at the same time
He may indeed as God be omnipresent but as man the
New Testament no where asserts that the Incarnate Presence was in
different places at the same moment Instances of erroneous judgment
are frequent in those who illustrate holy writ Some have attempted to
embody Him whom no man hath seen at any time Some have filled
their skies with beings as little aerial as possible or apotheoses of
the Virgin and sundry saints Angels as some represent them even in
whole lengths are by anatomists regarded as monsters but what
then are the chubby winged heads without bodies with which some
artists etherealize their works Some err by mingling on the same
canvass the sacred and profane scripture characters and the
nondescripts of heathen mythology Nor is poetry free from the latter
error as is exemplified in the major and minor epics c of many
Christian poets The drawings of the monks splendid in colouring and
beautiful in finish are mostly ludicrous in design from glaring
anachronisms erroneous perspective c I saw a print in Montfaucon
where fish were gamboling like porpusses on the surface of the sea
and one or two were visible through the paddles of a boat In the
same volume was a print of the apotheosis of St Louis from
an illumination The holy prince was represented dying in the
foreground but over head were a couple of angels flying away with
his soul under the figure of a wretched infant skinny and naked
save the glory that covered his head in a kind of sheet or rather
sack
But to detail all the absurdities and indecencies of these revered
artists whether limners or carvers in wood were endless Their
anachronisms however have been of considerable service to the
antiquary Sculpture has its monstrosities architecture its
incongruities though not so palpable as those of painting because
the art is less generally understood by the common observer or rather
pictorial errors are in general easily detected by the eye alone
and sometimes by the most commonly informed mind but architectural
defects are only recognisable by those who have studied the principles
of this fine art Poetry I am sorry to say is not exempt from bulls
and blunders of various kinds and degrees of enormity many of which
have been from time to time exposed in a very amusing manner I
shall therefore in conclusion crave the liberty of producing one
which has lately come under my own cognizance A modern poet whose
compositions are fraught with beauty and genius sings
Then swooped the winds that hurl the giant oak
From Snowdons altitude
And another in stanzas of extreme strength and eloquent description
describes a storm at night among the mountains of Snowdon with
these expressions
The bird of night
Screams from her strawbuilt nest as from the womb
Of infant death and wheels her drowsy flight
Amid the pineclad rocks with wonder and afright
The nightbreeze dies
Faint on the mountainash leaves that surround
Snowdons dark peaks
Now a painful pilgrimage of eleven hours up Snowdon and back again
enables me to declare that had oaks pines and servicetrees adorned
that appalling and volcanic chaos five or six years since some storm
sufficient to have shattered the universe must have swept them all
away ere I looked upon that dreary assemblage of rocks which seems
like the ruins of a world I ascended from the Capel Cerig side of
the mountain and therefore venture not to say what may be the aspect
of the Llanberries but the only verdure I beheld was that of short
brown heathy grass a few stunted furzebushes and patches of that
vividly green moss which is spongy and full of water The only living
inhabitants of these wilds were a few ruffianlike miners two or
three black slugs and a scanty flock of straggling halfstarved
mountain sheep with their brown ropy coats The guide told me that
even eagles had for three centuries abandoned the desolate crags
of Snowdon and as for its being a haunt for owls neither bird nor
mouse could reside there to supply such with subsistence Snowdon
appeared to me too swampy to be drained for cultivation in many parts
and in most others its marble granite and shingles forbade the idea
of spontaneous vegetation I am sorry for the poets having a sincere
regard for the fraternity but Snowdon is not adorned with pines
firs larches and servicetrees like parts of the Alps it is not
wooded like the romantic Pyrenees nor luxuriantly fertile in fruits
flowers and grain like the terrible but sylvan Etna

OLD POETS
DRUMMOND OF HAWTHORNDEN
A Lover of Old English Poetry has in the last London Magazine
a short paper on DRUMMOND of HAWTHORNDEN a name dear to every
poetical mind and every lover of early song His intention he says
is rather to excite than satiate the taste of his readers for the
poetry of Drummondan object in which we cordially agree and would
contribute our offering had not the task in the present instance
been already so ably performed We cannot therefore do better than
introduce to our readers a few of his judicious selections They are
exquisite specimens of the evergreen freshness of old poetry and by
their contrast with contemporary effusions will contribute to the
mosaic of our sheet By the way we hear of a sprinkling of the
antique world of letters in some of the Annualsan introduction
which reflects high credit on the taste of the editors and serves
to prove that sicklied sentimentalities like all other sweets when
enjoyed to excess will cloy the fancy but not so as entirely to
unfit the mind for a higher species of intellectual enjoyment We
would have old and new alternate in the literary wreath lest by
losing the comparison the bright lights of other times should be
treated with irreverence and neglect
FROM THE HYMN ON THE FAIREST FAIR
I feel my bosom glow with wonted fires
Raised from the vulgar press my mind aspires
Wingd with high thoughts unto His praise to climb
From deep Eternity who calld forth time
That ESSENCE which not movd makes each thing move
Uncreate beautyallcreating love
Ineffable allpowerful GOD all free
Thou only livst and all things live by thee
Perfections sumprime cause of every cause
Midst and beginning where all good doth pause
Incomprehensible by reachless height
And unperceived by excessive light
O King whose greatness none can comprehend
Whose boundless goodness does to all extend
Light of all beauty ocean without ground
That standing flowestgiving dost abound
Great ArchitectLord of this universe
That sight is blinded would thy greatness pierce
Then follows this noble simile nobly sustained and with a flow and
harmony of verse not common in the poets of his period
Ah as a pilgrim who the Alps doth pass
Or Atlas temples crownd with winter glass
The airy Caucasus the Apennine
Pyrenees cliffs where sun doth never shine
When he some craggy hills hath overwent
Begins to think on rest his journey spent
Till mounting some tall mountain he do find
More heights before him than he left behind
With halting pace so while I would me raise
To the unbounded limits of Thy praise
Some part of way I thought to have oerrun
But now I see how scarce I have begun
With wonders new my spirits range possest
And wandering wayless in a maze them rest
Oh that the cause which doth consume our joy
Would the remembrance of it too destroy
LIFE
Woods cut again do grow
Bud doth the rose and daisy winter done
But we once dead do no more see the sun
What fair is wrought
Falls in the prime and passeth like a thought
SONNETSPRING
Sweet Spring thou comst with all thy goodly train
Thy head with flame thy mantle bright with flowers
The zephyrs curl the green locks of the plain
The clouds for joy in pearls weep down their showers
Sweet Spring thou comstbut ah my pleasant hours
