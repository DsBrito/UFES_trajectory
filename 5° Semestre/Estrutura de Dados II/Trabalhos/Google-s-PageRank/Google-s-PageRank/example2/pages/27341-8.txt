MRS GRUNDY
By VIROQUA DANIELS
Her will is law She holds despotic sway
Her wont has been to show the narrow way
Wherein must tread the world the bright the brave
From infancy to dotards gloomy grave
Obey Obey with sternness she commands
The high the low in great or little lands
She folds us all within her ample gown
A forward act is met with angry frown
The lisping babes are taught her local speech
Her gait to walk her blessings to beseech
They laugh or cry as Mistress says they may
In everything the little tots obey
The youth know naught save Mrs Grundys whims
They play her games They sing her holy hymns
They question not accept both truth and fiction
The OLD is right within her jurisdiction
Maid matron man unto her meekly bow
She with contempt or ridicule may cow
They dare not speak or dress or love or hate
At variance with the program on her slate
Her subtle smile een men to thinkers grown
Are loath to lose before its charm theyre prone
With great ado they publicly conform
Vain cowards vain revolt MUST raise a storm
The indiscreet when hidden from her sight
Attempt to live as they consider right
Lo Walls have ears The loyal everywhere
The searchlight turn and loudly shout Beware
In tyranny the Mistress is supreme
Obedience that is her endless theme
Al countries oer in city town and glen
Her aid is sought by bosses over men
Of Greed her brain is cunningly devised
From Ignorance her bulky bodys sized
When at her ease she acts as judge and jury
But shes the Mob when roused to fighting fury
Dame Grundy is by far the fiercest foe
To evry kind of progress that we know
So Freedom is to her a poison thing
Who heralds it he must her death knell ring

A GREETING
By ALEXANDER BERKMAN
Dear Friends
I am happy inexpressibly happy to be in your midst again after an
absence of fourteen long years passed amid the horrors and darkness of
my Pennsylvania nightmare    Methinks the days of miracles are not
past They say that nineteen hundred years ago a man was raised from the
dead after having been buried for three days They call it a great
miracle But I think the resurrection from the peaceful slumber of a
three days grave is not nearly so miraculous as the actual coming back
to life from a living death of fourteen years durationtis the
twentieth century resurrection not based on ignorant credulity nor
assisted by any Oriental jugglery No travelers ever return the poets
say from the Land of Shades beyond the river Styxand may be it is a
good thing for them that they dontbut you can see that there is an
occasional exception even to that rule for I have just returned from a
hell the like of which for human brutality and fiendish barbarity is
not to be found even in the fireandbrimstone creeds of our loving
Christians
It was a moment of supreme joy when I felt the heavy chains that had
bound me so long give way with the final clang of the iron doors behind
me and I suddenly found myself transported as it were from the dreary
night of my prisonexistence into the warm sunshine of the living day
and then as I breathed the free air of the beautiful May morningmy
first breath of freedom in fourteen yearsit seemed to me as if a
beautiful nature had waved her magic wand and marshalled her most
alluring charms to welcome me into the world again the sun bathed in a
sea of sapphire seemed to shed his goldenwinged caresses upon me
beautiful birds were intoning a sweet paean of joyful welcome
greenclad trees on the banks of the Allegheny were stretching out to me
a hundred emerald arms and every little blade of grass seemed to lift
its head and nod to me and all Nature whispered sweetly Welcome Home
It was Natures beautiful Springtime the reawakening of Life and Joy
and Hope and the spirit of Springtime dwelt in my heart
I had been told before I left the prison that the world had changed so
much during my long confinement that I would practically come back into
a new and different world I hoped it were true For at the time when I
retired from the world or rather when I was retired from the
worldthat was a hundred years ago for it happened in the nineteenth
centuryat that time I say the footsteps of the world were faltering
under the heavy cross of oppression injustice and misery and I could
hear the anguishcry of the suffering multitudes even above the
clanking of my own heavy chains    But all that is different nowI
thought as I left the prisonfor have I not been told that the world
had changed changed so much that as they put it its own mother
wouldnt know it again And that thought made me doubly happy happy
at the recovery of my own liberty and happy in the fond hope that I
should find my own great joy mirrored in and heightened by the
happiness of my fellowmen
Then I began to look around and indeed I found the world changed so
changed in fact that I am now afraid to cross the street lest
lightning in the shape of a horseless car overtake me and strike me
down I also found a new race of beings a race of red
devilsautomobiles you call themand I have been told about the winged
children of thought flying above our headstalking through the air you
know and sometimes also through the hat perhapsand here in New York
you can ride on the ground overground above ground underground and
without any ground at all
These and a thousand and one other inventions and discoveries have
considerably changed the face of the world But alas its face only
For as I looked further past the outer trappings down into the heart
of the world I beheld the old familiar yet no less revolting sight of
Mammon enthroned upon a dais of bleeding hearts and I saw the ruthless
wheels of the social Juggernaut slowly crushing the beautiful form of
liberty lying prostrate on the ground    I saw men women and
children without number sacrificed on the altar of the capitalistic
Moloch and I beheld a race of pitiful creatures stricken with the
modern St Vituss dance at the shrine of the Golden Calf
With an aching heart I realized what I had been told in prison about
the changed condition of the world was but a miserable myth and my fond
hope of returning into a new regenerated world lay shattered at my
feet
No the world has not changed during my absence I can find no
improvement in the twentiethcentury society over that of the
nineteenth and in truth it is not capable of any real improvement for
this society is the product of a civilization so selfcontradictory in
its essential qualities so stupendously absurd in its results that the
more we advance in this wouldbe civilization the less rational the
less human we become Your twentiethcentury civilization is fitly
characterized by the fact that paradoxical as it may seem the more we
produce the less we have and the richer we get the poorer we are
Your pseudocivilization is of that quality which defeats its own ends
so that notwithstanding the prodigious mechanical aids we possess in the
production of all forms of wealth the struggle for existence is more
savage more ferocious today than it has been ever since the dawn of
our civilization
But what is the cause of all this what is wrong with our society and
our civilization
Simply thisa lie can not prosper Our whole social fabric our
boasted civilization rests on the foundations of a lie a most gigantic
liethe religious political and economic lie a triune lie from whose
fertile womb has issued a world of corruption evils shams and
unnameable crimes There denuded of its tinsel trappings your
civilization stands revealed in all the evil reality of its unadorned
shame and tis a ghastly sight a mass of corruption an everspreading
cancer Your false civilization is a disease and capitalism is its most
malignant form tis the acute stage which is breeding into the world a
race of cowards weaklings and imbeciles a race of mannikins lacking
the physical courage and mental initiative to think the thought and do
the deed not inscribed in the book of practice a race of pigmies
slaves to tradition and superstition lacking all force of individuality
and rushing like wild maniacs toward the treacherous eddies of that
social cataclysm which has swallowed the far mightier and greater
nations of the ancient world
It is because of these things that I address myself to you fellowmen
Society has not changed during my absence and yet to be saved it
needs to be changed It needs above all real men men and women of
originality and individuality men and women not afraid to brave the
scornful contempt of the conventional mob men and women brave enough to
break from the ranks of custom and lead into new paths men and women
strong enough to smash the fatal social lockstep and lead us into new
and happier ways
And because society has not changed neither will I Though the
bloodthirsty hyena of the law has in its wild revenge despoiled me of
the fourteen most precious blossoms in the garden of my life yet I
will henceforth as heretofore consecrate what days are left to me in
the service of that grand ideal the wonderful power of which has
sustained me through those years of torture and I will devote all my
energies and whatever ability I may have to that noblest of all causes
of a new regenerated and free humanity and it shall be more than my
sufficient reward to know that I have added if ever so little in
breaking the shackles of superstition ignorance and tradition and
helped to turn the tide of society from the narrow lane of its blind
selfishness and selfsufficient arrogance into the broad open road
leading toward a true civilization to the new and brighter day of
Freedom in Brotherhood

HENRIK IBSEN
M B
I SHALL not attempt to confine him within the rigid lines of any
literary circle nor shall I press him into the narrow frame of school
or party nor stamp upon him the distinctive label of any particular
ism He would break such fetters his free spirit his great
individuality would overflow the arbitrary confines of the sole
Truth the only true principle The waves of his soul would break
down all artificial barriers and rush out to join the evermoving
currents of life
A seer has died
He carried the flaming torch of his art behind the scenes of societyhe
found there nothing but corruption He tested the strength of our social
foundationsits pillars shook they were rotten
The rays of his genius penetrated the darkness of popular ideals the
hollow pretences of Philistinism filled his ardent soul with disgust
and pain In this mood he wrote The League of Youth in which he
exposed the pettiness of bourgeois aspirations and the poverty of their
ideals
In The Enemy of the People Ibsen thunders his powerful protest against
the democracy of stupidity the tyrannous vulgarity of majority rule
Doctor Stockmannthat is Ibsen himself How willing and eager the
pigmies and yahoos would have been to stone him
What shameless unconventionality what shocking daring cried the
Philistines when they beheld the characters portrayed in Nora The
Dolls House Wild Duck and in The Ghostsliving pictures
revealing all the evil hidden by the mask of our sacred institutions
our holy hearthstone In Rosmersholm Ibsen ignored even the
inviolability of conscience for there Ibsen showed how the sick
conscience of Rosmer worked the ruin of Rebecca and himself by robbing
them of the joy of life
The moralists howled long and loud
Has Ibsen no ideals Does the accursed Midastouch of his mind dissolve
everything one very Holy of Holies into the ashes of nothing
Thus spoke selfsufficient arrogance
But can one read Brand or Peer Gynt and ask such questions No heart
so overflowed with human yearning no soul ever breathed grander nobler
ideals than Henrik Ibsen True he did not prostrate himself before the
idols of the conventional mob nor did his sacrificial fires burn on the
altar of mediocrity and cretinism He did not bow the proud head before
the craven images that the State and Church have created for the
subjugation of the masses To Ibsens free soul the morality of slaves
was a nightmare
His ideal was Individuality the development of character He loved the
man that was brave enough to be himself He immeasurably hated all that
was false he abhorred all that was petty and small He loved that true
naturalness which when most real requires no effort
The most severe critic of Ibsen and his art was Ibsen himself His
attitude towards himself in his last work When We Dead Awaken is
that of the most unprejudiced judge
What is the result
We long for life yet we are eternally chasing willothewisps We
sacrifice ourselves for things which rob us of our Self The castles we
build prove houses made of cards upon the first touch falling down
Instead of living we philosophize Our life is an esthetic counterfeit
A mind of great depth a soul of prophetic vision has passed away yet
not without leaving its powerful impressfor Henrik Ibsen stood upon
the heights and from their loftiest peaks we beheld with him the
heavy fogs of the present and through the rifts we saw the bright rays
of a new sun the promise of the dawn of a freer stronger Humanity

OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS
Schopenhauers advice to ignore fools and knaves and not to speak to
them as the best method of keeping them at a distance does not seem
drastic enough in these days of the modern newspaperreporter nuisance
One may throw them out of the house nail all the doors and windows and
stuff up all keyholes still he will come he will slide down through
the chimney squeeze through the sewerpipeswhich by the way is the
real field of activity of the journalistic profession
We Anarchists are usually poor business men with a few happy
exceptions of course still we shall have to form an insurance company
against the slugging system of the reporters
Alexander Berkman barely had a chance to breathe free air when the
newspaper scarecrows were let loose at his heels Every
suspiciouslooking man woman and child in New York was assailed as to
Berkmans whereabouts without avail Finally these worthy gentlemen
hit upon 210 East Thirteenth streetthere the reporters made some
miraculous discoveries Two lonely hermits utterly innocent of the ways
of the world and the impertinence of reporters were marked by the
latter They triumphed Never before had they hit upon such simpletons
of whom they could so easily learn all the secrets of the fraternity of
the Reds
Is it not the custom of your clan to delegate every three days one of
your members to take the life of some ruler they asked
One of the Reds smiled knowingly Only one insignificant life in three
days How little you know the Anarchists I want you to understand
sirs it is our wont to use just five minutes for each act which means
864 lives in three days
This was more than the most hardened press detective could stand They
fled in terror

Carl Schurz politician and career hunter by profession died May 14th
He was met at the gate of Hell by the secretary of that institution with
the following question Were you not one of the enthusiasts for the
battle of freedom in your young days
Yes said Carl
If the reports of my men are correctand I am confident my men are
more reliable than the majority of the newspaper men on your planetyou
were even a Revolutionist
Carl Schurz nodded
And why have you thrown your ideals and convictions overboard
There was no money in them Carl replied sulkily
The Satanic Secretary nodded to one of his stokers saying Add 5000
tons of hard coal to our fires Here we have a man that sold his soul
for money He deserves to roast a thousand times more than the ordinary
sinner
Illustration
No one considers a thief the patron saint of honesty nor is a liar
expected to champion the truth The hangman is not elected as president
of a society for the preservation of human life why then in the name
of common sense do people continue to see in the State the seat of
justice and the patron saint of those whom it wrongs and outrages daily
If people would only look closer into the elements of the State they
would soon behold this trinitythe thief the liar and the hangman
Illustration
Free love is condemned prostitution flourishes The moralist who is
the best patron of the dens of prostitution loudly proclaims the
sanctity and purity of monogamy The free expression of lifes greatest
forcelovemust never be tolerated On the other hand it is perfectly
respectable to receive a large sum of money from a millionaire
fatherinlaw for marrying his daughter
Illustration
Rudolph von Jhering one of the most distinguished theoreticians of
jurisprudence in Europe wrote many years ago The way in which one
utilizes his wealth is the best criterion of his character and degree of
culture The purpose that prompts the investment of his money is the
safest characterization of him The accounts of expenditures speak
louder of a mans true nature than his diary How well these words
apply to the richest of the rich and to their methods of disposing of
their capital
Take philanthropy for instance with its loud and common display How
it humiliates those that receive and how it overestimates the
importance of those that give
Philanthropy that steals in large quantities and returns of its bounty
in medicine drops that snatches the last bite from the mouth of the
people and graciously gives them a few crumbs or a gnawed bone
Again philanthropy as a money maniain one instance it feeds the
clergy on fat salaries so that they might proclaim the virtue of
selfdenial sobriety and prudence in another instance it builds Sunday
schools for young numbskulls and political aspirants who pretend to
listen to the commonplace discourse about our Father in Heaven who gives
every true Christian an opportunity to make money rather would these
milksops appreciate the advice of the young nabob as to how to turn a
hundreddollar bill into a thousand
Philanthropy establishing scientific societies for the investigation of
the mode of life of fleas or philanthropy excremating libraries
maintaining missionaries in China or fostering the research of breeding
sea horses
Mrs Vanderbilt has the heels of her shoes set in diamonds while
another great philanthropist has established a pension for aged parrots
Indeed the stupidity and sad lack of imagination of our philanthropists
are pitiful However when one realizes that they are responsible for
the distress the poverty and despair of the great masses of humanity
pity turns into anger and disgust with a society that will endure it

The Chicago papers report a bloodcurdling story which has affected the
Philistines like red affects a turkey Knowing the keen sense of humor
of our readers we herewith reprint the story
Treason and blasphemy as an outburst of Anarchism all but broke up a
meeting held last night in the Masonic Temple under the auspices of the
SpencerWhitman Center at which the subject of Crime in Chicago was
discussed by various speakers The Rev John Roach Straton pastor of
the Second Baptist Church was in the midst of the discourse detailing
his theories with reference to the subject in hand when a voice from the
doorway shouted out a blasphemous expression
The cry was greeted by hisses but it was only a moment later that the
same voice called
Down with America Up with Anarchy
There was a rush for the door A tall young man was the first to reach
the offender who is said to have been Carl Havel associate editor of a
German newspaper There was a blow and the blasphemer reeled and fell
against the wall At the same moment a man said to be Terence Carlin a
member of a prominent Chicago family struck Havels assailant He in
turn was seized by Parker H Sercombe chairman of the meeting and a
man who gave the name of Ben Bansig
The party struggled back and forth in the doorway and the disturbers
were forced back to an anteroom Blows were struck in a lusty fashion
and cries of Police Theyre murdering them Help rang out
Finally the two disturbers made as if to get out and the arrival of a
watchman in uniform quieted them and their pursuers It was however
with ill grace that the disturbers of the meeting were allowed to leave
and as they passed through a door cursing the law the country and
God a girl still in her teens broke through the crowd and turning to
Havel said
Thats all right father
Ben Bansig saved Chicagothere can be no dispute about that As to
Sercombe the editor of ToMorrow he deserves recognition I suggest
that he be awarded a tooth brush at the expense of City Hall
Our three friends Terence Carlin Havel Mary Latterwho as I can
authentically prove is not the daughter of Hyppolite Havelcan console
themselves with the fact that their protest has done the names of
Whitman and Spencer more honor than the gas of the Baptist preacher

That the suspiciouslyred noses of the newspaper men should have smelt
the immoral conduct of Maxim Gorky was really very fortunate for the
latter He is now relieved from the impertinence of interviewers and
prominent personages He must feel as if he had recovered from some
loathsome disease Immorality has after all many desirable qualities
What if chickens gaggle pharisaic goats piously turn up their eyes and
the dear little piggies grunt
Illustration
Wellmeaning people are horrified that justice is making use of such
creatures as Orchard and McParland against Moyer Haywood and Pettibone
There is nothing unusual in that The record of the American government
in its persecution against Socialists and Anarchists is by no means so
clean that one need be astonished that it employs spies and perjurers as
its helpmates

A LETTER
Chicago June 2nd 1906
Dear EditorI hope you have not been trying to relieve your feelings
by using language dangerous to your souls salvation I can sympathize
with you though However it was impossible for me to send the promised
article for M E Who indeed could expect a bride of two weeks to
waste time upon magazine articles I hope you have read the reports of
my marriage though your silence would indicate that you have either
neglected to read the important news or that your usual lack of faith
in the truth and honesty of the press has not permitted you to credit
the story
It is high time dear friend that you get rid of your German
skepticism you know I esteem your judgment but when it comes to
doubting anything the newspapers say I draw the line What reporters do
not know about Anarchists and especially about your publisher is not
worth knowing According to their great wisdom I not only incited men to
remove the crowned heads of various countries but I have done worseI
have incited them to marry me and when they proved unwilling to love
honor and obey the order of our secret societies to blow up all sacred
institutions I sent them about their business
Much as I realize the importance of my articles for MOTHER EARTH you
cannot expect me to sacrifice my wifely duty to my lord and master for
Earths sake
I have always held to the opinion that there must be absolute confidence
between publisher and editor on all matters except the receipts
therefore I have to confess that my newlywedded husband who has just
graduated from the University of the Western Penitentiarythe
curriculum of which is lots of liberty leisure and enjoymentobjects
to the drudgery of an agitator and publisher In justice to him I dare
not do more than write letters all day address meetings every evening
and enjoy the love and kindness of the comrades till early morning
hours Where then shall I find time to write articles for MOTHER
EARTH
But to be in keeping with the serious and dignified tone of our valuable
magazine and especially with you dear Editor I want to say that my
meetings were very successful and that MOTHER EARTH is being received
with great favor in every city Nearly 500 copies were sold here
After reading the brilliant reports in the Chicago papers and seeing the
handsome refined policemen at the various meetings I am not surprised
that our magazine is being appreciated Apropos of the Chicago police
just fancy I have actually forced them out of their uniforms I hope
this will not conjure up the horrible picture of Chicagos finest
parading the city in Adams costume Not that Only Chief of Police
Collins was so outraged over my gentle criticism of his dear little boys
at one of the woodworkers meetings that he gave strict orders No
officer should again appear at a public meeting in uniform where that
awful Emma Goldman is humiliating and degrading the emblem of authority
and law
After this I hope you will never again doubt the importance of public
meetings and the great and farreaching influence of my speaking
I shall soon be with you if I survive my tour the police and the
press I shall then try to make up for my sins in the July number of
MOTHER EARTH provided you will let me recuperate in your editorial care
and affection

LIBERTARIAN INSTRUCTION
By EMILE JANVION
AMONG the important duties of Anarchists libertarian instruction should
occupy the first place As revolutionary propaganda it is the most
effective Tolstoi in YasnaiaPoliana Reclus at Bruxelles Paul Robin
at Cempius the group of the Free School at Paris have inaugurated
attempts during the period of daring we have witnessed of late years
Far from mixing education with instruction the former should be
considered as the natural consequence of the latter
Our ideas should never be imposed by an education too specialized
narrow or sectarian but by means of full and allround instruction
which opens the mind to criticism and makes it accessible to the power
of truth which is our strength and which will complete the forming of
the character
Our instruction should be integral rational and mixed
IntegralBecause it will tend to develop the whole being and make a
complete free ensemble equally progressive in all knowledge
intellectual physical manual and professional and this from the
earliest age
RationalBecause it will be based on reason and in conformity with
actual science and not on faith on the development of personal Freedom
and independence and not on that of piety and obedience on the
abolition of the fiction God the eternal and absolute cause of
subjection
MixedBecause it favors the coeducation of the sexes in a constant
fraternal familiar company of children boys and girls which gives to
the character of their manners a special earnestness
To the scientific instruction must be added manual apprenticeship
instruction with which it is in a constant connection of balance and
reciprocity and also esthetic instruction music art etc which in
point of view of an integral development has certainly not a small
importance
To turn our attention towards the child to encourage the development of
its initiative to impress it with a sentiment of its dignity to
preserve it from cowardice and falsehood to make it observe the pros
and cons of all social conceptions to educate it for the struggle
that is the great work scarcely yet begun which awaits us
That will be the task of the nearest future if we will act logically and
firmly

THE ANTICHRIST
From The Antichrist by Friedrich Nietzsche Edited by Alexander
Tille translated by Thomas Common Publishers Macmillan  Co New
York
I MAKE war against this theological instinct I have found traces of it
everywhere Whoever has theological blood in his veins is from the very
beginning ambiguous and disloyal with respect to everything The pathos
which develops therefrom calls itself belief the closing of the eye
once for all with respect to ones self so as not to suffer from the
sightof incurable falsity A person makes for himself a morality a
virtue a sanctity out of this erroneous perspective towards all things
he unites the good conscience to the false mode of seeinghe demands
that no other mode of perspective be any longer of value after he has
made his own sacrosanct with the names of God salvation and
eternity I have digged out the theologistinstinct everywhere it is
