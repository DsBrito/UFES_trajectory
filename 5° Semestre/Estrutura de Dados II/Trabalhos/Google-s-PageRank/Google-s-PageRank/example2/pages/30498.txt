TWO MAIDEN AUNTS
CHAPTER I
THE AUNTS
Child be mother to this childE B BROWNING
It was seven oclock on an autumn morning nearly a hundred years ago
A misty October morning when the meadows looked grey with the heavy
dew and the sky was only just beginning to show pale blue through the
haze which veiled it
There was a certain little hamlet just a few cottages clustered
together beside a country road where the world seemed hardly yet
awake  The road ran across a wide common where the cows and horses
and geese wandered about pretty much as they chose and the
blackberries grew as they grow only on waste ground  The blackberry
season was pretty nearly over and the damp had taken the taste out of
those which the village children had left but the dewy nights were
still warm enough to bring up the mushrooms like fairy tables in all
directions and there was at least one gatherer from the village who
had been astir an hour ago for the common was a wellknown mushroom
ground and early birds had the best chance  He was coming back now
with a goodly basketful shaking showers of dew off the grass at every
step and leaving a track of footmarks behind him  Through the mist he
looked a sort of giant but he was only a tall sturdy lad of
seventeen in a fustian jacket and the wide hat which countrymen used
to wear in the days of our grandfathers  He turned off the common
before he reached the village and went down a little lane at the end
of which stood a small gabled house in a garden where the autumn
flowers hung their heads under the heavy dew  There was a paddock
behind the house where a cow was feeding and a gate led through a yard
to the back door and thither the boy was turning when he noticed a
little girl in homespun frock and sunbonnet leaning over the garden
gate looking up rather wistfully at the shuttered windows of the
house  She gave a great start as the boy came behind her and laid his
hand suddenly on her shoulder
Now then Nance he said severely what are you about disturbing
the place at this time in the morning
The little girl shook his hand off with an impatient shrug
What be you about Pete starting me like that  Im not doing nothing
nor disturbing nobody  I can look at the cottage I suppose without
you to call me up for it
Motherll be fine and angry when she hears what youve been at said
the boy peeping and prying on the young ladies and them in trouble
Nancy put up her pretty lip with the injured look of a spoilt child
Im not peeping nor prying nor hurting nobody and if I am what are
you doing I should like to know  Then as she noticed his basket
she clapped her hands with a little triumphant laugh
I know what tis youre after she cried youve been off and got
them mushrooms and youve brought them for the young ladies so as you
can see Penny or maybe Miss Betty herself and hear whether its really
true  And havent I got some eggs my own hens eggs here for them
and only just waiting till they open the shutters to take them in
Well why dont you go round to the back door as is the proper place
for you said the stern elder brother instead of staring at
gentlefolks houses like a great gawky
Well come to that I know which is the biggest gawky of us two said
pert little Nance and if you must know I was just waiting for the
chance of Miss Betty coming down seeing Penny might be in one of her
tantrums and not tell me a word  Then as the front door of the house
suddenly opened she exclaimed joyously
Look if she isnt there and was darting in at the gate when her
brother caught her and held her back  Come away will you ye
interfering little hussy he was beginning hastily when the girl who
had opened the door caught sight of the two and came down the garden
path towards them  Spoilt Nancy shook herself free and with a
triumphant glance at her big brother she ran to meet the young lady
and Peter could do nothing but follow her and indeed if the truth
must be told he was not at all sorry to do it and perhaps just a
little grateful to naughty Nancy for showing the way
The early riser from the cottage was a girl of thirteen a very pretty
little girl with a fair fresh face sunshiny hazel eyes and hair of
that golden brown colour which the bracken wears in autumn  She seemed
to have dressed in rather a hurry for her long black frock was not
quite perfectly fastened the muslin scarf round her shoulders was just
a little crooked and the black ribbon which tied the bright hair had
not managed to catch it all so that a few curly locks came tumbling
out at the side  She had shut the house door very quietly and she
held up her finger for a sign of silence as she came down the path and
Nancy who had started off running to meet her stopped as if a sudden
feeling of shyness had come over her a feeling it must be owned
which didnt often trouble Nancy certainly not towards Miss Betty
Wyndham whom she had known ever since she could remember  But then
she had never seen Miss Betty look quite like this before in her black
frock and with such a grave look in her merry eyes a look that was
rather sad and yet perhaps more serious than sad and that somehow
made Nancy stop and curtsey and Peter pull off his hat with that sort
of shy respect which the most careless among us must pay to a fresh
sorrow or loss  But in spite of her grave look Miss Betty seemed
very pleased to see them
Good morning Pete good morning Nancy she said  How kind of you
to come so early  Did you guess I should be down
I thought maybe you would miss said Nancy only the shutters being
up I thought you must be asleep still
I dressed in the dark said Miss Betty giving her scarf a little tug
which didnt straighten it much because I didnt want to wake Angel
Poor Angel she was so late coming to bed last night Id been asleep
ever so long and woken up again while she was talking to Penny
And then she stopped and looked from one to the other with a
questioning look in her eyes
You know dont you she said at last youve heard about the sad
thing thats happened
For once in a way Nancy left her brother to answer
We havent heard nothing for certain Miss Betty he said only
people talked and we knew Penny had gone to fetch you home but father
said we werent to say nothing till we knew for certain
Its quite true said Miss Betty gravely quite dreadfully true
Pete  Our brother Mr Bernard has been killed in the West Indies
and we are very poor now we have left school and come home to live
I fear that the last piece of news so much did away with the sadness of
the first that Nancys face broadened into a delighted smile and she
only just cut short an exclamation of joy  Luckily Miss Betty was not
looking at her and she saw Peters frown and felt a little ashamed of
herself
I want to tell you everything Miss Betty went on it was very nice
of your father not to want people to talk but now we should like every
one to know because we are very proud of my brother and we want our
friends to be  Will you come into the arbour and Ill tell you and
she led the way across the garden while Peter and Nancy followed
willingly enough  The arbour was that sort of bower which we see in
oldfashioned pictures and sing about in old songs  There had been
roses climbing over it all the summer and a few blossoms hung there
still pale and fragrant among a tangle of clematis and everlasting
peas  On the little grass plot just outside the arbour there was a
stone figure not like the nymphs and Cupids and watercarriers which
we find in trim oldfashioned gardens and stately pleasure grounds but
the chipped worn figure of a lady lying with folded hands and a quaint
headdress and straight falling hair  No one quite knew where that
statue came from except that it must have lain once upon a tomb in
some church or monastery chapel and in evil days when men had
forgotten their reverence for holy ground and the quiet dead the tomb
must have been destroyed and the figure defaced and thrown out as
rubbish  Then some one later on had brought her to the cottage and set
her up as an ornament to the garden leaning against a tree and
looking very strange and uncomfortable  When Betty and her sister were
little children they were half afraid of the tall grim figure which
looked queer and uncanny among the bushes in the twilight but as they
grew older and knew more about her they lost their fear of her and
began to be sorry for her and they got Peter and some of the village
boys to move her out of her unnatural position and lay her down on the
grass as she had once lain on her tomb in the church and planted
flowers beside her  And the great purple convolvulus or as I love to
call it by its sweet old name the Morning Glory seeded itself every
year and twined its soft tendrils and opened its lovely flowers all
about the poor lady as if it wanted to hide all the marks of hard
usage and the grass made her a soft pillow and the pink rose petals
dropped all about her and she looked as if she were happily asleep
among the flowers  And when she was being moved the boys came upon
some other pieces of stone among the bushes which might have been part
of the same tomb  There was one bit with part of a coatofarms on it
which no one could make out and another bit with some letters many of
them quite defaced but after a lot of puzzling and rubbing the moss
off the little girls managed to read the two words Demoiselle
Jehanne  Miss Angelica felt sure it was French and she copied it out
and took it back to school to ask her schoolmistress what it meant
And the mistress said she was right it was most likely old
NormanFrench such as was talked in England five or six hundred years
ago and that demoiselle was the title of a young lady and Jehanne
was the old way of writing Jeanne or Jane  So Angelica and Betty
decided directly that it must be the name of their stone lady and
called her Demoiselle Jehanne or to make it clearer to Peter and
their other village friends Miss Jane  And it was wonderful what a
companion Miss Jane had become to them they never felt really alone
when they were sitting beside her  Betty made up stories about her
and Angelica wondered about her and about the days when she was alive
and how old she was when she died and whether she ever saw Edward the
Black Prince and whether she had a father and a mother who were very
sad when they put that figure over her grave  And often when anything
had gone wrong with the sisters they would come and sit down on the
grass by the arbour and tell it to Miss Jane and feel as if she
sympathized with them and comforted them  And if more lucky little
girls are inclined to laugh at them I would ask them to be thankful
that they are happier than my two little sisters and have a mother to
whom they can go and tell their troubles instead of whispering them
into the broken stone ear of Miss Jane
And perhaps it was partly that old custom of theirs that made Betty at
this moment when she wanted to tell about the great change that was
coming into her life lead the way to the arbour and sit down on the
bench close to the silent figure among the trailing creepers  Peter
and Nancy stood in front of her and waited for her to speak both a
little embarrassed as we are when we arent quite sure how we ought to
feel and what we ought to say  It was very sad of course about Mr
Bernard Wyndham being dead but as they had neither of them ever seen
him in their lives it was rather difficult to mind very much  But
then they knew they ought to think about what Miss Betty was feeling
Nancy looked at Pete and felt that it would be dreadful to have ones
brother killed even if he did scold one and keep one in order rather
too much  But then a brother who had been in the West Indies for
twelve out of the thirteen years of ones life was different from a
brother who was always there to get one blackberries and lift one over
hedges and even box ones ears when one required it  And besides as
I have said Miss Betty did not look exactly very sad only grave and
just the least little bit important  So they waited to hear what she
had to say
It is quite true Pete and Nancy she began Mr Bernard has been
killed in a dreadful rising of the natives in the West Indian Islands
He was very very braveof course we knew he would be thatand he has
died as an Englishman ought to die so we shall never be able to show
him all the things we wanted to show him and to introduce him to all
of you here as we always thought we should  Miss Bettys voice began
to shake a little for the first time and Pete and Nancy waited in
respectful silence  After a minute she went on
But Angel says we must try to be very proud to think of him dying so
bravely for she says that women all over England are giving up so
much that we ought to be glad to think that we have given something
too  And now I am coming to the part that is the most surprising
Only thinkour brother was married married out there eight years ago
and he never told us  I suppose he wanted to give us a beautiful
surprise when he brought us a new sister home
She waited for somebody to say something  Peters face did not look as
if he thought the surprise a very beautiful one
Beg your pardon Miss Betty he said doubtfully but Mr Bernards
lady shedshed be black I suppose
Black exclaimed Betty in horror  Oh dear me no Peter  Of
course she wouldnt be black  There are English people in the West
Indies or my brother wouldnt have been there and it was an English
lady he married but poor lady she died when shed only been our
sister not quite a year  I suppose that was why Bernard never told us
afterwards because of not wanting us to know what wed missed  It was
very very brave and very unselfish of him of course but Angel and I
wish he had because then we could have written and said how sorry we
were and perhaps comforted him a little  And now Im coming to the
most surprising thing of all  My brother had a little boy and he is
seven years old now and he is in England and he will be here
tonight  Miss Betty hurried out these last pieces of news one on the
top of the other and then stopped and looked at her hearers who
certainly seemed surprised enough to satisfy her
Poor little gentleman said kindhearted Peter tis a sad coming to
England for him for sure and him an orphan and alone in the world as
one may say
No Peter one maynt say anything of the kind said Miss Betty
pulling herself up and looking as dignified as she possibly could  Of
course hes an orphan poor dear little boy but he cant be alone in
the world at all when hes got two aunts and his aunt Angelica and I
will take good care he never feels like an orphan the darling
Nancys eyes opened their very widest  But Miss Betty she said I
thought aunts were old people
Oh Nancy said Betty with an air of wisdom you have a very great
deal to learn Nancy dear  It is not the age that makes the aunt
Nancy it is the nephew or the niece  And as for being old Angelica
and I arent so very young  She was sixteen last winter and I am
thirteen and people have done a great deal at thirteen as youll
learn when you read biography  And even if we havent been so very
old before we have to begin now and grow up at once for we are going
to live here and be independent ladies with our cousin Mr Crayshaw
coming down now and then from London to see us andand talk over
business and advise us about our money matters and we shall have
Godfrey our nephew Godfrey to take care of and educate  Angel says
she went on after a minute while the faces of her listeners showed
great satisfaction at the arrangements that we must put everything
else on one side and bring up our nephew as his father would have
wished to be a proper English gentleman and a credit to his family
She says we can fit ourselves to do any duty that we have got to do
and our duty now is to be good aunts and we must be that with all
our might and here the good aunt broke off suddenly as her eye fell
for the first time on the baskets which her listeners were holding
Did you bring those for us she exclaimed  Oh how kind of you
Are those Pollys eggs Nance  I guessed they were and the mushrooms
are off the common I know  Whereabouts did you get them Pete  I
must go with you some day very soon Im longing
And then as if with a sudden recollection the eager little lady pulled
herself up smoothed her crooked kerchief and shook the rebellious
hair out of her eyes and went on in her most sober tones I dont
know Peter whether I shall be able to come mushrooming much now  Of
course my nephew will take up a good deal of my time and Im not sure
whether many mushrooms are quite a good thing for children  But eggs
will be very nice for his breakfasta newlaid egg every day I think
not too hardboiled  And theres just one more little thing I hope
you wont mind but I fancy if you could get into the way of calling us
Miss Angelica and Miss Elizabeth when our nephew is there it would be a
good thing and make him look up to us more  You wont mind my saying
so will you  And now I think I must go because Angelbecause Miss
Angelica will be up so goodbye and thank you very much indeed for
coming
And the next minute Miss Betty was gone starting off in her usual
whirlwind fashion then pulling herself up and marching along solemnly
and with the dignity which became the aunt
But she forgot her dignity when she got upstairs and met her sister
coming out of her bedroom to look for her with a little shade of
anxiety in her face  Angelica Wyndham was one of those very gentle
thoughtful people who are so tender about their neighbours happiness
so fearful of hurting and slow to put their own wishes forward that we
hardly know how powerful that very gentleness makes them in their
little world  Everybody loved Angel and said how sweet she was and
how pretty but they hardly knew how they came to consider her and to
go out of their way to please her just because she always thought so
much about other people that really it was a shame to vex her  She was
not particularly quick except with that sort of quickness which we can
all learn by being thoughtful for others and watchful to please and
help them  She was not nearly so clever as Betty and she knew it
quite well and was never a bit jealous when Betty passed her in class
and learnt her lessons in half the time and Betty on her side
thought there was no one in all the world like Angel and would have
done anything to please her and always hoped that one day she might be
half as wise and good  And so this morning when she saw her sister
standing in the doorway with the little worried anxious look in her
gentle eyes she flung her arms round her and stood on tiptoe to kiss
her exclaiming eagerly
Angel dear did you wonder where I was  Did I wake you getting up  I
left the blinds down on purpose  Ive only been talking to Pete and
Nancy and telling them all about it and Nancys brought us some eggs
and Petes got such a basket of mushrooms
You havent been on the common for mushrooms this morning have you
dear asked Angelica
Oh no no of course not Angel how could I  No I told him perhaps
I shouldnt be able to go with him now  You neednt be afraid Angel
Ive told him all about it and how we are going to grow up now at
once as we have to be Godfreys maiden aunts and I told him to call
me Miss Elizabeth and he quite understands
Angel with an arm round Bettys neck among the tumbled curls
wondered in her gentle way whether her eager young sister quite
understood herself but all she said was
Come in and let me tie your hair Betty dear
Isnt it tidy said Betty with a pull at her loose locks then as
she stopped beside the lookingglass and caught sight of herself in
contrast to Angelicas graceful figure looking taller and slimmer in
the straight black dress with the soft muslin about her slender throat
and the dark abundant curls falling smoothly on her shoulders she
exclaimed in dismay
Oh Angel dear Im so sorry  I dressed in the dark
I know Betty dear  Sit down and let me do your hair said the elder
sister getting the ribbon off with as little pulling of the tangled
curls as possible
You see she said very gently and diffidently as she set to work to
put Betty in order Ive been thinking a great deal about this dear
little boy of ours and Betty it makes me feel so young
Does it said Betty twisting her head round so as to look into her
sisters face why Angel dear it makes me feel old
Yes I know what you mean  I mean it makes me feel silly and
inexperienced when I ought to be wise  You see Betty I think we
ought both to consider that we havent got Bernards little boy to
please ourselves with him and pet him and give him everything he
wants  He wont be a plaything for uswe have to make a man of him
and as he hasnt any one else to look to we mustnt let him just take
us for playfellows he must look upon us as
As his maiden aunts said Betty emphatically yes Angel I quite
see that
You see Angelica went on I expect when we get the dear little
thing to ourselves we shall find it much easier to romp with him and
pet him and all that and so we might if there were any one else older
and wiser for him to look up to but it wouldnt do for a little boy
only to have playfellows there must be some one for him to respect
And as there isnt any one else it must be us said Betty
decidedly for he wont have any one else belonging to him to respect
except Cousin Crayshaw about once a fortnight which isnt very often
and so we shall have to be instead of a father and mother and uncles
and aunts and grandmothers and everybody that little boys have to
respect all rolled into one
And not think at all about pleasing ourselves with him as if he were a
kitten said Angel gravely you see things so quickly Betty
dear
But there her sentence was cut short by Betty springing up suddenly and
flinging both arms round her
Angel she cried if you talk like that Ill never forgive you  If
he cant be good with you to teach him he doesnt deserve to have you
for his relation  And you are always to scold meonly it mustnt be
when he is thereif I forget about growing up and do stupid things and
make myself so that he cant respect me  And perhaps byandbye if
you tell me and I try very hard indeed I may get to be a real good
proper sensible maiden aunt

CHAPTER II
THE NEPHEW
Hers is a spirit deep and crystal clear
Calmly beneath her earnest face it lies
Free without boldness meek without a fear
Quicker to look than speak its sympathiesLOWELL
As Betty Wyndham had said she and Angel were not very well off for
relations  Angelicas memory held some faint faraway pictures of
mother and father which she had dreamt over so often that they were
always fair and tender like the hazy distance of an autumn landscape
Dimly too she could recollect the time of loss and loneliness and
halfunderstood grief when she cried herself to sleep at night for want
of the familiar kisses and she had hazy remembrances of strange faces
and changes and a time when the cottage by Oakfield Common was a new
home and Cousin Amelia Crayshaw the elderly relation with whom she
and Betty were to live and who had died two years before this story
begins was a strangera rather alarming stranger so unlike mamma
that it seemed unnatural to go to her for things and ask her
questions and say the Catechism to her on Sunday
And there was one other recollection which Angel had thought of and
talked to Betty about so often that it made quite a landmark in her
life the recollection of a day in that dreary time when she sat a
little lonely frightened child only dimly understanding the meaning
of her black frock by the cradle where baby Betty was asleep crying
in a hushed awed way as much at the grave faces and the drawn blinds
as because papa and mamma had gone away for they must surely come back
byandbye
Then her nurse Penelope looked into the darkened room with a face
swollen with crying and said in a whisper Miss Angel dear speak to
your brother and pushed in a lad whom Angel had never seen before
and went away treading softly as every one did in the shadowed house
Little Angel left off crying and looked up at the stranger who stood
there by the door with a white set face of pain which frightened her
Then she got up obediently and came to him and held up a little pale
face to be kissed as she had learnt to do to her friends  And the
tall lad caught her up suddenly and held her tight in a clasp which
hurt her and sat down in her little chair and burst into strong
weeping over her curly hair  And Angel frightened as she was knew
she ought to try and comfort him and so stroked the hands that held
her so tightly and whispered tremulously that byandbye papa and
mamma would be coming back for Penny had cried over her because they
were gone away and this mysterious brother must be grieving about it
too  And once or twice he said out loud I did love them  I did love
them and his voice sounded quite fierce only he held her so close
all the time that Angel felt he could not be angry with her  And then
baby Betty woke and cried and the fouryearold sister and the big
brother soothed her between them until Penny came back to the door and
called softly and cried afresh to see the young gentleman with Betty
in his arms and Angel holding on to his coat  And he kissed them both
quickly and went away and Angelica never saw him again  He went
abroad she knew very soon afterwards for Penny told her to pray that
the ship might not go down on the way but Cousin Amelia never talked
about him and Angel with the quick intuition of a little child soon
learnt that she did not care to speak of him  But if Angel spoke
little she thought the more
All her pitiful little heart had gone out to the big brother who had
cried so about papa and mamma and had said he loved them as Angel
loved them herself and had hushed Betty to sleep and held her and
kissed her as kind quiet Cousin Amelia never did
When she and Betty grew older and went to school and heard other girls
talk about their brothers Angel added all the good things she learnt
to her fancies about her brother abroad and Bettys active imagination
improved upon the picture until they hardly knew how much of it was
their own painting and how much belonged to that dim recollection of
Angels childhood
And now the fancies had come suddenly to an end which was real enough
and the brother would never come home to live with them and play with
them and let them mend his clothes and knit his stockings as other
sisters did  And instead they had to get used to the strange idea of
the dead unknown wife and the little son for whose sake they were to
grow up into wise sober women before they had done with being little
girls  What wonder that Angel looked pale and grave after a wakeful
night and that Betty felt that madcap ways and tumbled curls must
cease from this day forward
Little Nancy Rogers hurrying home so as to get there before Peter
felt herself a person of importance with such news to tell  Her
father was gardener at Oakfield Place the most important building in
the village an ivied house with a garden full of sweet oldfashioned
flowers planted by the late mistress who had died six years before
The present owner Captain Maitland was a naval officer away with his
ship and the house was empty except for the Rogers family who lived
in some of the back rooms that Mrs Rogers might keep the place in
order  Before she married she had been maid to Miss Amelia Crayshaw
and still came in now and then when Penny wanted extra help and her
children and the two little ladies had been playfellows for Angel and
Betty had no girl friends near their home and when Cousin Amelia
would let them were happy enough to spend their holidays running about
the old garden with the little Rogers getting mushrooms and
blackberries under Peters charge or on wet days playing hide and
seek about the empty house  And even Cousin Amelia who was very
particular about their manners and the company they kept admitted that
Martha Rogers children could not teach them any harm  Indeed it was
Betty who now and then led the whole party into scrapes for which
however she was always ready enough to bear the blame
So that there was no house in Oakfield where the news of Mr Bernards
death and the arrival of his little son was received with more interest
than at the Rogers even though Nancy did get a scolding for going off
to the cottage and taking up Miss Bettys time without a word to any
one at home  But Nancy was the baby and a little spoilt even by her
sensible mother and it took a good deal of scolding to put her out of
conceit with herself so though she had strict orders on no account to
go to the cottage again till she was sent for she managed to be by the
roadside at that hour in the evening when Mr Crayshaws postchaise
always arrived on the occasions of his visits to Oakfield  And so she
saw the chaise and the horses and a black box on the top but it was
too dark for even her inquisitive black eyes to get a peep at the
travellers  And in the twilight of the October evening the two young
aunts were awaiting the nephew who was to be henceforward such a great
part of their lives  Angel stood in the cottage porch under a tangle
of twining creepers looking gravely out into the shadows  It seemed
to her as if out of that darkness something strange and great were
coming to hernew duties new cares and thoughts which would change
her from a quiet obedient little girl into a wise thoughtful woman
And with very little confidence in her own power or wisdom she was
trying to be brave and making up her mind to do her best  Bettys
clear voice on the stairs roused her from her grave thoughts
No not meat tonight Penny its too late it isnt good for
children to have heavy suppers only the breadandmilk please and
do do take care not to burn the milk because I know quite well how
horrid it was when they burnt it at school
Bless your heart Miss Betty dear was the answer oned think I
never made a basin of breadandmilk in my life instead of feeding you
