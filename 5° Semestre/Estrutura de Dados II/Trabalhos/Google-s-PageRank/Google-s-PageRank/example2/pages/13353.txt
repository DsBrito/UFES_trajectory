PSALM CXXI THE MINISTRY OF THE HILLS AND ALL GREAT THINGS
PSALM XXIII
GOD OUR SHEPHERD
The twentythird Psalm seems to break in two at the end of the fourth
verse The first four verses clearly reflect a pastoral scene the fifth
appears to carry us off without warning to very different associations
This however is only in appearance The last two verses are as pastoral
as the first four If these show us the shepherd with his sheep upon the
pasture those follow him shepherd still to where in his tent he
dispenses the deserts hospitality to some poor fugitive from blood The
Psalm is thus a unity even of metaphor We shall see afterwards that it
is also a spiritual unity but at present let us summon up the landscape
on which both of these featuresthe shepherd on his pasture and the
shepherd in his tentlie side by side equal sacraments of the grace and
shelter of our God
A Syrian or an Arabian pasture is very different from the narrow meadows
and fenced hillsides with which we are familiar It is vast and often
virtually boundless By far the greater part of it is desertthat is
land not absolutely barren but refreshed by rain for only a few months
and through the rest of the year abandoned to the pitiless sun that sucks
all life from the soil The landscape is nearly all glare monotonous
levels or low ranges of hillocks with as little character upon them as
the waves of the sea and shimmering in mirage under a cloudless heaven
This bewildering monotony is broken by only two exceptions Here and there
the ground is cleft to a deep ravine which gapes in black contrast to the
glare and by its sudden darkness blinds the men and sheep that enter it
to the beasts of prey which have their lairs in the recesses But there
are also hollows as gentle and lovely as those ravines are terrible where
water bubbles up and runs quietly between grassy banks through the open
shade of trees
On such a wilderness it is evident that the person and character of the
shepherd must mean a great deal more to the sheep than they can possibly
mean in this country With us sheep left to themselves may be seen any
dayin a field or on a hillside with a fartravelling fence to keep them
from straying But I do not remember ever to have seen in the East a flock
of sheep without a shepherd
On such a landscape as I have described he is obviously indispensable
When you meet him there alone of all his reasoning kind armed
weatherbeaten and looking out with eyes of care upon his scattered
flock their sole provision and defence your heart leaps up to ask Is
there in all the world so dear a sacrament of life and peace as he
There is and very near himself As prominent a feature in the wilderness
as the shepherd is the shepherds tent To Western eyes a cluster of
desert homes looks ugly enoughbrown and black lumps often cast down
anyhow with a few loutish men lolling on the trampled sand in front of
the low doorways that a man has to stoop uncomfortably to enter But
conceive coming to these a man who is fugitivefugitive across such a
wilderness Conceive a man fleeing for his life as Sisera fled when he
sought the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite To him that space
of trampled sand with the ragged black mouths above it mean not only
food and rest but dear life itself There by the golden law of the
deserts hospitality he knows that he may eat in peace that though his
enemies come up to the very door and his table be spread as it were in
their presence he need not flinch nor stint his heart of her security
That was the landscape the Psalmist saw and it seemed to him to reflect
the mingled wildness and beauty of his own life Human life was just this
wilderness of terrible contrasts where the light is so bright but the
shadows the darker and more treacherous where the pasture is rich but
scattered in the wrinkles of vast deserts where the paths are illusive
yet mans passion flies swift and straight to its revenge where all is
separation and disorder yet law sweeps inexorable and a man is hunted
down to death by his bloodguiltiness But not in anything is life more
like the Wilderness than in this that it is the presence and character of
One which make all the difference to us who are its silly sheep that it
is His grace and hospitality which alone avail us when we awaken to the
fact that our lives cannot be fully figured by those of sheep for men are
fugitives in need of more than foodmen are fugitives with the conscience
and the habit of sin relentless on their track This is the main lesson of
the Psalm the faith into which many generations of Gods Church have sung
an ever richer experience of His Guidance and His Grace We may gather it
up under these three headsthey cannot be too simple I The Lord is a
Shepherd II The Lord is my Shepherd and III if that be too feeble a
figure to meet the fugitive and hunted life of man the Lord is my Host
and my Sanctuary for ever
I The Lord is my Shepherd oras the Greek vibrating to the force of
the originalThe Lord is shepherding me I shall not want This is the
theme of the first four verses
Every one feels that the Psalm was written by a shepherd and the first
thing that is obvious is that he has made his God after his own image
There are many in our day who sneer at that kind of theologypretty
indeed as the pearl or the tear but like tear or pearl a natural and
partly a morbid deposita mere human process which according to them
pretty well explains all religion the result of mans instinct to see
himself reflected on the cloud that bounds his view mans honest but
deluded effort to put himself in charge of the best part of himself
filling the throne of an imaginary heaven with an impossible exaggeration
of his own virtues
But it is far better to hold with Jesus Christ than with such reasoners
Jesus Christ tells us that a man cannot be wrong if he argues towards God
from what he finds best in himself If ye then being evil know how to
give good gifts to your children how much more shall your Heavenly Father
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him What man of you having an
hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine
in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it
Either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth
not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find
it  Likewise I say unto you There is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth
That is a true witness and strikes Amen out of every chord of our hearts
The Power so evident in nature that He needs no proof the Being so far
beyond us in wisdom and in might must also be our great superior in every
quality which is more excellent than might With thoughts more sleepless
than our thoughts as the sun is more constant than our lamps with a
heart that steadfastly cares for us as we fitfully care for one another
more kingly than our noblest king more fatherly than our fondest
fatherhood of deeper truer compassion than ever mother poured upon us
whom when a man feels that he highest thing in life is to be a shepherd
he calls his Shepherd and knows that as the shepherd whose the sheep
are shrinks not to seek one of his lost at risk of limb or life so his
God cannot be less in readiness of love or of selfsacrifice Such is the
faith of strong and unselfish men all down the ages And its strength is
this that it is no mere conclusion of logic but the inevitable and
increasing result of duty done and love kept pureof fatherhood and
motherhood and friendship fulfilled One remembers how Browning has put
it in the mouth of David when the latter has done all he can do for
Saul and is helpless
Do I find love so full in my nature
Gods ultimate gift
That I doubt His own love can
compete with it
Would I fain in my impotent yearning
do all for this man
And dare doubt he alone shall not
help him who yet alone can
Could I wrestle to raise him from
sorrow grow poor to enrich
To fill up his life starve my own out
I wouldknowing which
I know that my service is perfect
Oh speak through me now
Would I suffer for him that I love
So wouldst thouso wilt thou
Thus have felt and known the unselfish of all ages It is not only from
their depths but from their topmost heightsheaven still how farthat
men cry out and say There is a rock higher than I God is stronger than
their strength more loving than their uttermost love and in so far as
they have loved and sacrificed themselves for others they have obtained
the infallible proof that God too lives and loves and gives Himself away
Nothing can shake that faith for it rests on the best instincts of our
nature and is the crown of all faithful life He was no hireling herdsman
who wrote these verses but one whose heart was in his work who did
justly by it magnifying his office and who never scamped it else had he
not dared to call his God a shepherd And so in every relation of our own
lives While insincerity and unfaithfulness to duty mean nothing less than
the loss of the clearness and sureness of our faith in God duty nobly
done love to the uttermost are witnesses to Gods love and ceaseless
care witnesses which grow more convincing every day
The second third and fourth verses give the details Each of them is
taken directly from the shepherds custom and applied without
interpretation to the care of mans soul by God He maketh me lie
downthe verb is to bring the flocks to fold or couchon pastures of
green grassthe young fresh grass of springtime By waters of rest He
refresheth me1 This last verb is difficult to render in English the
original meaning was evidently to guide the flock to drink from which it
came to have the more general force of sustaining or nourishing My life
He restorethbringeth back again from death He leadeth me in paths
of righteousness for His names sake not necessarily straight paths but
paths that fulfil the duty of paths and lead to somewhere unlike most
desert tracks which spring up tempt your feet for a little and then
disappear Yea though I walk in a valley of deep darkness I will fear
no evil for Thou art with me Thy rod and Thy staff are not synonymous
for even the shepherd of today though often armed with a gun carries
two instruments of wood his great oak club thick enough to brain a wild
beast and his staff to lean upon or to touch his sheep while the ancient
shepherd without firearms would surely still more require both They will
comfort mea very beautiful verb the literal meaning of which is to
help another choked with grief or fear to breathe freely and give his
heart air
Footnote 1 The Greek reads epi hudatos anapauseos exethrepse me
These simple figures of the conduct of the soul by God are their own
interpretation Who from his experience cannot read into them more than
any other may help him to find Only on two points is a word required
Righteousness has no theological meaning The Psalmist as the above
exposition has stated is thinking of such desert paths as have an end and
goal to which they faultlessly lead the traveller and in Gods care of
man their analogy is not the experience of justification and forgiveness
but the wider assurance that he who follows the will of God walks not in
vain that in the end he arrives for all Gods paths lead onward and lead
home This thought is clinched with an expression which would not have the
same force if righteousness were taken in a theological sense for His
names sake No being has the right to the name of guide or shepherd
unless the paths by which he takes the flock do bring them to their
pasture and rest The other ambiguous phrase is the vale of deep
darkness As is well known the letters of the word may be made to spell
shadow of death but the other way of taking them is the more probable
This however need not lead us away from the associations with which our
old translation has invested them It is not only darkness that the poet
is describing but the darkness where death lurks for the poor sheepthe
gorges in whose deep shadows are the lairs of wild beasts and the
shepherd and his club are needed It stands thus for every dismal and
deadly passage through which the soul may pass and most of all it is
the Valley of the Shadow of Death There God is with men no less than by
the waters of repose or along the successful paths of active life Was He
able to recover the soul from lifes wayside weariness and hungerHe
will equally defend and keep it amid lifes deadliest dangers
II But the Psalm is not only theology It is personal religion Whether
the Psalmist sang it first of the Church of God as a whole or of the
individual the Church herself has sung it through all generations of
the individual By the natural progress of religion from the universal to
the particular by the authority of the Lord Jesus who calls men singly
to the Father and one by one assures them of Gods Providence Grace and
Glory by the millions who have taken Him at His word and every man of
them in the loneliness of temptation and duty and death proved His
promisewe also in our turn dare to believe that this Psalm is a psalm
for the individual The Lord is my shepherd He maketh me to lie down
He leadeth me He restoreth my soul Lay your attention upon the
little word Ask yourself if since it was first put upon your lips you
have ever used it with anything more than the lips if you have any right
to use it if you have ever taken any steps towards winning the right to
use it To claim God for our own to have and enjoy Him as ours means as
Christ our Master said over and over again that we give ourselves to Him
and take Him to our hearts Sheep do not choose their shepherd but man
has to chooseelse the peace and the fulness of life which are here
figured remain a dream and become no experience for him
Do not say that this talk of surrender to God is unreal to you Happiness
contentment the health and growth of the soul depend as men have proved
over and over again upon some simple issue some single turning of the
soul Lives are changed by a moments listening to conscience by a single
and quiet inclination of the mind We must submit ourselves to God We
must bring our wills under His Here and now we can do this by resolution
and effort in the strength of His Spirit which is nearer us than we
know The thing is no mystery and not at all vague The mistake people
make about it is to seek for it in some artificial and conventional form
We have it travestied today under many formsunder the form of throwing
open the heart to excitement in an atmosphere removed from real life as
far as possible under the form of assent to a dogma under the form of
adherence to a church
But do you summon up the most real things in your lifethe duty that is
a disgust the sacrifice for others from which you shrink Summon up your
besetting sinthe temptation which for all your present peace you know
will be upon you before twentyfour hours are past Summon up these grim
realities of your lifeand in face of them give yourself to Gods will
put your weakness into the keeping of His grace He is as real as they
are and the act of will by which you give yourself to Him and His Service
will be as true and as solid an experience as the many acts of will by
which you have so often yielded to them
Otherwise this beautiful name this name Shepherd must remain to you the
emptiest of metaphors this Psalm only a fair song instead of the
indestructible experience which both Name and Psalm become to him who
gives himself to God
Men and women who in this Christian land have grown up with this Psalm in
your hearts in all the great crises of life that are ahead shall this
Psalm revisit us In perplexity and doubt in temptation and sorrow and
in death like our mothers face shall this Psalm she put upon our lips
come back to us Woe to us then if we have done nothing to help us to
believe it As when one lies sick in a foreign land and music that is
dear comes down the street and swells by him and lifts his thoughts a
little from himself but passes over and melts into the distance and he
lies colder and more forsaken than beforeso shall it be with us and this
Psalm
But if we do give our hearts to God and His Will if day by day of our
strength we work and serve live and suffer with contented heartsthen I
know what we shall say when the day of our darkness and loneliness comes
down whether it be of temptation or of responsibility or of death
itself In that day we shall lift our faces and say Yea though I am
walking in the Valley of the Shadow of Death I do fear no evil for Thou
art with me and Thy rod and Thy staff they comfort me
III But some one may turn round upon all this and say It is simple it
is ideal but the real man cannot reach it out of real life For he is not
the mere sheep turned easily by a touch of the staff He is a man his
life is no mere search for grass it is a being searched it is not a
following it is a flight Not from the future do we shrink even though
death be there The past is on our track and hunts us down We need more
than guidance we need grace
This is probably what the Psalmist himself felt when he did not close with
the fourth verse otherwise so natural a climax He knew that weariness
and death are not the last enemies of man He knew that the future is
never the true mans only fear He remembered the inexorableness of the
past he remembered that bloodguiltiness which sheep never feel is
worse to men than death As perchance one day he lifted his eyes from his
sheep and saw a fugitive from the avenger of blood crossing the plain
while his sheep scattered right and left before this wild intruder into
their quiet worldso he felt his fair and gentle thoughts within him
scattered by the visitation of his past so he felt how rudely law breaks
through our pious fancies and must be dealt with before their peace can
be secure so he felt as every true man has felt with him that the
religion however bright and brave which takes no account of sin is the
religion which has not a last nor a highest word for life
Consider this system of blood revenge It was the one element of law in
the lawless life of the desert Everything else in the wilderness might
swerve and stray This alone persisted and was infallible It crossed the
world it lasted through generations The fear of it never died down in
the heart of the hunted man nor the duty of it in the heart of the
hunter The holiest sanctions confirmed itthe safety of society the
honour of the family love for the dead And yet from this endless
process which hunted a man like conscience a shelter was found in the
custom of Eastern hospitalitythe golden piety of the wilderness as it
has been called Every wanderer whatever his character or his past might
be was received as the guest of Godsuch is the beautiful name which
they still give himfurnished with food and kept inviolate his host
becoming responsible for his safety
That the Psalmist had this custom in view when composing the last two
verses of the Psalm is plain from the phrase with which these open Thou
spreadest before me a table in the very face of mine enemies and perhaps
also from the unusual metaphor in verse 6 Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow or hunt me all the days of my life
And even if those were right which I do not admit who interpret the
enemies and pursuers as the mere foes and persecutors of the pious it is
plain that to us using the Psalm this interpretation will not suffice How
can we speak of this custom of bloodrevenge and think only of our
material foes If we know ourselves and if our conscience be quick then
of all our experiences there is but one which suits this figure of
bloodrevenge when and wheresoever in the Old Testament it is applied to
mans spiritual life So only do the conscience and the habit of sin
pursue a man Our real enemies are not our opponents our adversities our
cares and pains These our enemies Better comrades better guides better
masters no man ever had Our enemies are our evil deeds and their
memories our pride our selfishness our malice our passions which by
conscience or by habit pursue us with a relentlessness past the power of
figure to express We know how they persist from youth unto the grave
the sting of death is sin We know what they want nothing less than our
whole character and will Simon Simon said Christ to a soul on the
edge of a great temptation Satan hath asked you back again for himself
Yet it is the abounding message of the whole Bible of which our
twentythird Psalm is but a small fragment that for this conscience and
this habit of sin God hath made provision even as sure as those thoughts
of His guidance which refresh us in the heat of life and comfort us amidst
its shadows
In Nature Yes for here too the goodness of God leadeth to repentance
There is nothing which the fifth verse so readily brings to mind as the
grace of the Divine hospitality in nature Thou spreadest a table before
me in the presence of mine enemies How these words contrast the fever
and uncertain battle of our life with the calmness and surety of the
Divine order Through the cross currents of human strife fretted and
stained the tides of nature keep their steady course and rise to their
invariable margins The seasons come up undisturbed by crime and war
Spring creeps even into the beleaguered city through the tents of the
besiegers across trench and scarp among the wheels of the cannon and
over the graves of the dead grass and wild flowers speed spreading
Gods table He sendeth His rain upon the just and the unjust And even
here the display is not merely natural nor spread only in the sight of
our physical enemies but Gods goodness leadeth to repentance and Nature
is equipped even for deliverance from sin Who has come out upon a great
landscape who has looked across the sea who has lifted his eyes to the
hills and felt the winds of God blowing off their snows who has heard
earths countless voices rising heavenwards but has felt What a wide
place this world is for repentance Man does find in Nature deliverance
from himself oblivion of his past with peace and purity And yet the
provision though real is little more than temporary The herdsmen of the
desert are not obliged to furnish to their fugitive guest shelter for more
than two nights with the day between Little more than two nights with the
day between is the respite from conscience and habit which Nature provides
for the sinful heart She is the millionfold opportunity of repentance
she is not the final or everlasting grace of God And therefore whatever
may have been the original intention of our Psalmist the spiritual
feeling of the Church has understood his last two verses to sing of that
mercy and forgiveness of our God which were spoken to men by the prophets
but reached the fulness of their proclamation and proof in Jesus Christ
He who owned the simple trust of the first four verses saying Thou art
right I am the Good Shepherd so that since He walked on earth the name
is no more a mere metaphor of God but the dearest strongest reality
which has ever visited this world of shadowsHe also has been proved by
men as the Host and Defender of all who seek His aid from the memory and
the pursuit of sin So He received them in the days of His flesh as they
drifted upon Him across the wilderness of life pressed by every evil with
which it is possible for sin to harry men To Him they were all guests of
God welcomed for His sake irrespective of what their past might have
been And so being lifted up He still draws us to Himself and still
proves Himself able to come between us and our past Whatever we may flee
from He keeps it away so that although to the last for penitence we
may be reminded of our sins and our enemies come again and again to the
open door of memory in Him we are secure He is our defence and our
peace is impregnable
PSALM XXXVI
THE GREATER REALISM
Like the twentythird Psalm the thirtysixth seems to fall into two
unconnected parts but with this difference that while both of the
twentythird are understood by us and heartily enjoyed of the
thirtysixth we appreciate only those verses 510 which contain an
adoration of Gods mercy and righteousness Verses 14 a study of sin
are unintelligible in our versions and hardly ever sung except in
routine by a Christian congregation So sudden is the break between the
two parts and so opposite their contents that they have been taken by
some critics to be fragments of independent origin This however would
only raise the more difficult question Why being born apart and
apparently so unsympathetic were they ever wedded To a more careful
reading the Psalm yields itself a unity The sudden break from the close
study of sin to the adoration of Gods grace is designed and from his
rhapsody the Psalmist returns to pray in verses 1012 against that same
evil with which he had opened his poem Indeed it is in this its most
admirable method more than in details that the Psalm is instructive and
inspiring
The problem of Israels faith was the existence of evil in its most
painful form of the successful and complacent sinner the oppressor of
good men This problem our Psalm takes not like other Psalms in its
cruel bearing upon the people of God but in its mysterious growth in the
character of the wicked man Through four verses of vivid realism we
follow the progress of sin Then when eye and heart are full of the
horror the Psalmist steps suddenly back and lifts his gaze beyond and
above his study of evil to Gods own world that stretches everywhere The
effect is to put the problem into a new perspective The black bulk which
had come between the Singer and his Sun shrinks from his new position to a
point against that universal goodness of the Lord and he conceives not
only courage to pray against it but the grace to feel it already beneath
his feet This is not an intellectual solution of the problem of evil but
it is a practical one The Psalm is a studyif we can call anything so
enthusiastic a studyin proportion the reduction of the cruel facts of
experience to their relation to other facts as real but of infinite comfort
and glory the expansion in short of the words of verse 9 In Thy light
we see light
The Psalmists analysis of sin has been spoiled in translation Take our
Old Version or the Revised one and you will find no meaning in the first
two verses but take the rendering offered on the margin by the Revisers
and approved by most scholars and you get a meaning intelligible
profound and true to experience
Oracle of sin hath the wicked in the
midst of his heart
There is no fear of God before his eyes
The word oracle means probably secret whisper but is elsewhere used
except in one case of Gods word to His prophets It is the instrument
of revelation The wicked man has in him something comparable to this Sin
seems as mysterious and as imperative as Gods own voice to the heart of
His servants And to counteract this there is no awe of God Himself
Temptation in all its mystery and with no religious awe to meet itsuch
is the beginning of sin
The second verse is also obscure It seems to describe the terrible power
which sin has of making men believe that though they continue to do evil
they may still keep their conscience The verse translates most readily
though not without some doubt
For it flatters him in his eyes
That he will discover his guiltthat he will hate it
While sin takes from a man his healthy taste for what is good and his
power to loathe evil it deludes him with the fancy that he still enjoys
them Temptation when we yield is succeeded by selfdelusion
The third and fourth verses follow clearly with the aggravated effects
Sin ceases to flatter and the mans habits are openly upon him Truth
commonsense and all virtue are left behind
The words of his mouth are iniquity
and deceit
He has given up thinking sensibly
and doing good
So he becomes presumptuous and obstinate
He devises iniquity upon his bedwhich is but the Hebrew for planning
evil in cold blood
He takes up his post on a way that
is not good
He abhors not evil
There we have the whole biography of sin from its first whisper in the
centre of mans being where it seems to speak with the mystery and power
of Gods own word to the time when through the corruption of every
instinct and quality of virtue it reaches the border of his being and
destroys the last possibility of penitence It is the horror of Evil in
the four stages of its growth Temptation Delusion Audacity and Habit
ending in Death
To us sin has not become any less of a mystery or a pain Temptation is as
sudden and demonic Into every soul however purged and fenced evil
appears to have as much freedom of entrance as God Himself It begins as
early In the heart of every little child God works but they who next to
God have most right there the father and the mother know that something
else has had with God precedence of themselves As the years go on and
the knowledge of good and evil grows becoming ever more jealous and
expert a sentinel it still finds its watch and fence of the outside world
mocked by the mysterious upburst of sin within The whole mystery of
temptation is to have sins suggested to us and to be swept after them by
a sudden enthusiasm which sometimes feels as strong as the Spirit of God
ever made in us the enthusiasm for virtue There are moments when our
passions speak and decide for us and we seem to stand by and wonder
They carry in them an inspiration of crime that in an instant does the
work of long premeditation2 An inspiration of crime that is the
oracle of sin From that come the panic and the despair of temptation
The heart which has still left in it some loyalty to God is horrified by
the ease and the surprise of evil Yet the greater horror is that this
horror may be lost that men and women do continually exchange it for a
complacent and careless temper toward the besetting sin which they have
once felt to be worse than death From being panicstricken at the rise
and surge of temptation they will and there is no more marvellous change
in all fickle mans experience grow easy and scornful about it time
after time permitting it to overcome them in the delusion that they may
reassert themselves when they will and put it beneath their feet The
rest is certain Falsehood becomes natural to him who was born loyal
audacity to him who grew up timid and scrupulous The impulsive lover of
good who has fallen through the very warmth of his nature develops into
the deliberate sensualist Natures sensitive and enthusiastic grow
absolutely empty of power to revolt against what is unjust or foul A
great writer once said of himself in middle life I am proud and
intellectual but forced by the habits of years to like the base and
dishonourable from which I formerly revolted Little children have the
seeds of all this within them men and women are born with the inspiration
which starts these mysterious and direful changes the fatal decadence
takes place in countless lives
Footnote 2 George Eliot
Before facts so horrifyingthey are within as well as everywhere around
usour real need is not an intellectual explanation of why they are
permitted or whence this taint in the race arose For supposing that we
were capable of understanding this the probability is that we might
become tolerant of the facts themselves and perceiving that cruelty and
sin had a necessary place in the universe lose the mind to fight them
Constituted as are the most of mankind for them to discover a reason for
a fact is if not to conceive a respect for it at least to feel a
plausible excuse for their sluggishness and timidity in dealing with it
Nay the very study of sin for the purpose of acquainting ourselves with
its nature too often either intoxicates the will or paralyses it with
despair and it is in recoil from the whole subject that we most surely
recover health to fight evil in ourselves and nerve to work for the
deliverance from it of others The practical solution of our problem is to
remember how much else there is in the Universe how much else that is
utterly away from and opposed to sin We must engross ourselves in that
we must exult in that We must remember goodness not only in the
countless scattered instances about us but in its infinite resource in
the Power and Character of God Himself We must feel that the Universe is
