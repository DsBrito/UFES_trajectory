INTRODUCTION
For these many years past a considerable number of Esquimaux have been
in the annual practice of visiting the three missionary establishments
of the United Brethren on the coast of Labrador OKKAK NAIN and
HOPEDALE chiefly with a view to barter or to see those of their
friends and acquaintance who had become obedient to the gospel and
lived together in Christian fellowship enjoying the instruction of the
Missionaries
These people came mostly from the north and some of them from a great
distance They reported that the body of the Esquimaux nation lived
near and beyond Cape Chudleigh which they call Killinek and having
conceived much friendship for the Missionaries never failed to request
that some of them would come to their country and even urged the
formation of a new settlement considerably to the north of Okkak
To these repeated and earnest applications the Missionaries were the
more disposed to listen as it had been discovered not many years after
the establishment of the Mission in 1771 that that part of the coast on
which by the encouragement of the British government the first
settlement was made was very thinly inhabited and that the aim of the
Mission to convert the Esquimaux to Christianity would be better
obtained if access could be had to the main body of the Indians from
which the roving inhabitants appeared to be mere stragglers
Circumstances however prevented more extensive plans from being put in
execution and the Missionaries having gained the confidence and esteem
of the Esquimaux in their neighbourhood remained stationary on that
coast and by degrees formed three settlements OKKAK to the north
and HOPEDALE to the south of NAIN their first place of residence
In consequence of the abovementioned invitation it became a subject of
serious consideration by what means a more correct idea of the extent
and dwellingplaces of the Esquimaux nation might be obtained and a
general wish was expressed that one or more of the Missionaries would
undertake the perilous task of visiting such places as were reported by
the Esquimaux themselves to contain more inhabitants than the southern
coast but remained unknown to European navigators
The Synodal Committee appointed for the management of the Missions of
the United Brethren having given their consent to the measure and
agreed with Brother Kohlmeister by occasion of a visit paid by him to
his relations and friends in Germany as to the mode of putting it into
execution he returned to Labrador in 1810 and prepared to undertake
the voyage early in the spring of 1811
For several years a correspondence had taken place between the
Missionaries in Labrador and the Brethrens Society for the Furtherance
of the Gospel established in London relating to the manner in which
the voyage should be performed Opinions were various on the subject
but it was at length determined that a steady intelligent Christian
Esquimaux possessing a shallop with two masts and of sufficient
dimensions should be appointed to accompany one or two Missionaries
for a liberal recompence and that the travellers should spend the
winter at Okkak to be ready to proceed on the voyage without loss of
time as soon as the state of the ice would permit of it Brother
Kohlmeister proposed in this view the Esquimaux Jonathan of Hopedale
and the brig employed to convey the annual supply of necessaries to the
three settlements was ordered to proceed first to Hopedale partly with
a view to this negociation She arrived safe with Brother Kohlmeister at
this place on the 22d July 1810 On the same day he proposed to
Jonathan the intended expedition laid before him the whole plan with
all its difficulties and advantages and found him immediately willing
to undertake the voyage and to forward its object by every means in his
power
This was no small sacrifice on the part of Jonathan An Esquimaux is
naturally attached to the place of his birth and though he spends the
summer and indeed great part of the year necessarily and from
inclination in roving from one place to another in quest of food yet
in winter he settles if possible upon his native spot where he is
esteemed and beloved This was eminently the case with Jonathan He was
a man of superior understanding and skill possessed of uncommon
presence of mind in difficulties and dangers and at Hopedale considered
as the principal person or chief of his nation But he was now ready to
forsake all and to go and reside at OKKAK among strangers having no
authority or preeminence and to undertake a voyage of unknown length
and peril from whence he could not be sure of a safe or speedy return
before the ice might set in and confine him upon an unknown shore
during the whole of a second winter There was however one
consideration which outweighed every other in his mind and made him
according to his own declaration forget all difficulties and dangers
He hoped that the proposed voyage to visit his countrymen in the north
would in time be a means of their becoming acquainted with the gospel
of Christ and partakers of the same blessings which he now enjoyed
This made him willing to accept of the call without any hesitation Nor
did he ever during the whole voyage forsake that generous principle
by which he was at first influenced but his cheerful firm and
faithful conduct proved under all circumstances most honourable to the
character of a true convert to Christianity
Brother KOHLMEISTER being after seventeen years residence in Labrador
complete master of the Esquimaux language and deservedly beloved and
respected both by Christians and heathens and possessing an invincible
zeal to promote their temporal and spiritual welfare was a man
eminently qualified to undertake the commission and to conciliate the
affections of unknown heathen He had also previously made himself
acquainted with the use of the quadrant and with other branches of
science useful on such an occasion
Brother KMOCH his companion joined to other essential qualifications
great cheerfulness and intrepidity
All the parties having met at Okkak in the autumn of 1810 the winter
was partly spent in preparations for the intended expedition and
Jonathans boat put into the best possible state of repair
CHAPTER I
Outfit Opinions of the Esquimaux respecting the Voyage
Description of the Company Departure from Okkak Arrival at
Nungorome
June 16 1811The ice began to loosen in the bay of OKKAK and to
drive out to sea On the 17th the bay was quite cleared of it but on
the 18th it returned and seemed to preclude all possibility of setting
out so soon as we intended On the 19th however it left us entirely
20th We were employed in hauling the boat to the edge of the water and
being floated by the tide she came to anchor at six PM She had been
purchased by Jonathan at Chateaubay and was about 45 feet long
twelve broad and five deep with two masts We had furnished her with a
complete deck and divided her into three parts The centre was our own
cabin into which all our baggage was stowed the two other divisions
were occupied by the Esquimaux A small boat brought from Lewis was
taken in tow
21st We began to ship our provision and baggage viz six cwt of
ships biscuit sixteen bushels of pease one cwt of salt pork and best
beef of which but a small portion was consumed as we were generally
well supplied with fresh provisions procured by shooting a firkin of
butter half cwt of captains biscuit one cwt of flour two small
barrels of gunpowder one cwt of large and small shot half cwt of
tobacco two eighteengallon barrels of ale a few bottles of brandy
eighteen pounds of coffee which was all consumed coffee and biscuits
being our usual repast a case containing knives wire nails c for
barter if necessary kettles and other utensils Besides that every man
had his fowlingpiece we had four muskets in reserve After bringing
all on board we had just room enough to sleep in our cabin
22d was spent in conferring with our brethren on various subjects
relating to the voyage
23d All the Esquimaux met at the chapel and in the most affectionate
manner and with many tears bid us and our company farewell They were
the more affected with grief on this occasion as the greatest part of
our own Esquimaux thought the voyage impracticable and expected that we
should all perish in doubling Cape Chudleigh Killinek on account of
the violence of the currents setting round between the cape and the
many rocks and islands which stretch from it towards the north Reports
had likewise been circulated of the hostile disposition of the Esquimaux
in the Ungava bay and it was boldly asserted that if we even got there
alive we should never return An old conjuror Angekok Atsugarsuk
had been particularly active in spreading these reports We cannot deny
but that they occasioned some apprehension in our own minds but being
fully determined to venture in the name of God and trusting in His
protection we were thankful that they failed to produce the intended
effect on Jonathan our guide and on the other Esquimaux who were to
go with us and who all remained firm
When Jonathan was told that the Ungava Esquimaux would kill him he
generally answered Well we will try and shall know better when we
get there and once conversing with us on the subject expressed
himself thus When I hear people talking about the danger of being
killed I think Jesus went to death out of love to us what great
matter would it be if we were to be put to death in His service should
that be His good pleasure concerning us
24th Having commended ourselves in prayer to the grace and protecting
care of God our Saviour and to the kind remembrance of our dear fellow
missionaries we set sail at two PM
Our company consisted of four Esquimaux families 1 Jonathan and his
wife Sybilla both between fifty and sixty years old He was esteemed
one of the most skilful commanders on the whole coast of Labrador and
for many years has shown himself both able and willing to serve the
missionaries in a variety of ways The boat was his own property and we
considered him as the captain of the expedition 2 Jonas Jonathans
son and his wife Agnes about thirty years of age both intelligent
clever Esquimaux they had their five children with them Sophia
twelve years old Susanna Jonathan Thamar and Sybilla the
youngest but half a year old 3 Paul and his wife Mary very
agreeable sensible people about twenty years of age Paul is
Jonathans cousin and a man of a very warm temper In activity and
skill he was next to Jonathan 4 David and his mother Rachel the
first a hopeful young man of about twenty and the latter a goodnatured
old woman who had the care of our clothes and linen and kept them
clean and in good order Besides these four families we took with us a
boy Okkiksuk an orphan about sixteen whom Jonathan had adopted
and who promised to reward the kindness of his guardian by his good
behaviour He was always ready to render us every service in his power
We were attended on the voyage by a skinboat or womans boat in which
were Thukkekina and his wife and their adopted child Mammak a boy
twelve years old Their age is about forty The skinboat was intended
as a refuge in case of any accident happening to our own boat and was
useful in landing as we never brought the large boat close in shore
The first four families belong to Hopedale Thukkekina and his wife to
Okkak They considered it as a great favour conferred on them to be
permitted to accompany us Jonas and his family occupied the
afterpart and the rest the forepart of the boat The wind was
moderate and due west We lost sight of our habitations in about half
an hour behind the NE point of the island Okkak called Sungolik
At three passed Cape Uivak a cape on the continent forming a
moderately high headland and the nearest place to Okkak where
Esquimaux spend the winter Two or three winterhouses were standing
The wind failing we cast off the skinboat which rowed merrily ahead
Before us between the islands to the east and the continent we saw
much driftice and it required attention to avoid the large shoals the
wind coming round to the NW We cast anchor at NUNGOROME a cove about
ten English miles from Okkak where we found several of our Esquimaux
who had here their summerstation Several had come from Naujasiorvik
and other places on purpose to meet us and once more to express their
affection and best wishes for our safe voyage and return Late in the
evening we met on a green spot where Brother Kohlmeister delivered a
short discourse and prayer after which we retired to sleep on board the
boat
CHAPTER II
Departure from Nungorome Cove Account of Solomon Driftice
Cape Mugford Waterfalls from the Kaumayok Mountains Fruitless
attempt to get out of the Ikkerasak or Straits
Nungorome is a cove on the south side of the Island Pacharvik Between
this island the main land is a narrow strait so shallow that no whales
can pass The Esquimaux stretch their nets across to catch seals
seeking shelter in it when the wind sets in from the open sea They can
only be taken in the night and the greater part of those which frequent
this coast are of the Kairolik kind a middlesized animal and of the
Ugsuk the largest species of the seal tribe weighing sometimes from
five to six cwt
The Esquimaux belonging to our congregation who were at present
stationed here in tents were Moses Samuel Thomas Isaac
Bammiuk and their families Solomon who has left our communion
was also here He had formerly been a communicant member of Okkak
congregation but could not resist the temptation of going to the north
to feast with the heathen Esquimaux whenever they had caught a live or
found a dead whale On such occasions he was seduced to commit many
irregularities and sins but always returned to us with a show of great
contrition and repentance After many relapses he was informed that
this would do no longer but that if he went again to these heathenish
feasts he would be excluded He is a sensible welldisposed man and
perceived the justice of the sentence but his love of that species of
amusement overcame all his good resolutions He not only went again but
took also another wife a step which of course excluded him from our
fellowship Yet he is very desirous that his children may receive a
Christian education and remain faithful to the precepts of the gospel
25th Brother Kmoch rose at half past one in the morning and suffering
the rest to sleep on got breakfast ready he then fired his piece by
which Brother Kohlmeister and all the Esquimaux young and old were
suddenly roused from their slumbers Not one however regretted the
unexpected interruption to their pleasant dreams on beholding the sea
quite free from ice with a fine morning and fair wind but after
yawning stretching and shaking themselves as usual the Esquimaux with
great good humour got ready and we set sail at half past three Passed
Pacharvik Island at four Bammiuk and Solomon accompanied us as far as
the North Ikkerasak the Esquimaux name for a strait between Cape
Mugford Island in 58 N latitude and the mountains of Kaumayok Their
being in company retarded our progress but in the sequel proved no
disadvantage
About nine we entered the straits and perceiving at a distance much
driftice ahead cast anchor and Brother Kmoch and Jonas landed on
Cape Mugford Island An Esquimaux called Niakungetok accompanied
them to the top of an eminence from whence the outer opening of the
Ikkerasak was seen They perceived the ice driving into it from the sea
in such quantities as to threaten to close it up Cape Mugford is an
high island extending far into the ocean and the northern landmark in
steering for Okkak Kiglapeit promontory bearing south and the
Saddleisland appearing right before the entrance of the bay On their
return to the boat the wind veered to the north and we steered for a
dwellingplace of the Esquimaux about twenty miles from Okkak called
Ukkuararsuk To our great joy the ice began now to drive out again to
sea and we resolved to go with it A gentle SW wind brought us to the
place where we had before anchored but we were now beset with large
fields of ice among which we tacked till we had nearly cleared the
straits when the great quantity of surrounding ice pressing upon us
prevented our making further attempts and we were compelled to work
our way back with oars and boathooks
On Cape Mugford island we now discovered more Esquimaux who by signs
directed our course towards a convenient harbour near their dwellings
which we reached in safety
The Esquimaux pitched their tents on shore but we slept on board
The situation of this place is remarkably beautiful The strait is about
an English mile broad and four or five in length Both shores are lined
with precipitous rocks which in many places rise to a tremendous
height particularly on the Kaumayok side from whence several
waterfalls rush into the sea with a roar which quite fills the air
The singular appearance of these cataracts is greatly increased when
illuminated by the rising sun the spray exhibiting the most beautiful
prismatic colours Below them huge masses of ice are formed which seem
to lean against the sides of the rocks and to be continually increasing
during the winter but when melted by the power of a summers sun and
disengaged by their weight are carried off by the tides and help to
form floating icemountains The coast lies SW by NE
26th Being detained here by the state of the ice and the weather fine
and warm Brother Kmoch and Ogiksuk rowed across the straits to the
nearest great cataract and were able notwithstanding the steepness of
the ascent to get pretty close to it It falls fifty or sixty feet
perpendicular and the noise is terrible The spray ascending from it
like the steam of a huge cauldron wetted the travellers completely
They amused themselves some time by rolling large stones into the fall
which by its force were carried along towards the sea down the sloping
torrent below Our people meanwhile caught three seals and made a
hearty meal of which we also partook hunger on this occasion
overcoming our dislike to seals flesh A sallad of scurvygrass was
made for supper
27th We left this harbour about four AM with a favourable wind at
West but as it soon died away we took to our oars and reached the
north point of Kaumayok at the northern extremity of the strait By an
observation taken by Brother Kohlmeister this point is situated in 57
59 N latitude Though calm there was a great swell from the sea and
the rolling of the boat affected our brave captain not a little to the
diversion of the other Esquimaux About two PM the wind shifted to the
NW By tacking we got to Kupperlik about the middle of Kaumayok but
having the skinboat in tow could not weather the point and were at
length obliged to return to our former anchorage in the strait
28th The wind being North we could not proceed We therefore ascended
the mountain of Cape Mugford It is a barren rock though here and there
a solitary plant or a tuft of moss clings to its steep sides and is
difficult of access The numerous waterfalls on the Kaumayok which
still rose above us were full in view and we now discovered several
small lakes which supply them Some of them fall from a great height
perpendicularly into the sea
We could here discern the island of Okkak to the SW to the East the
boundless ocean and to the NE three high barren and steep islands
called Nennoktuts by the Esquimaux White mountains
CHAPTER III
Quit the Ikkerasak Account of the Kaumayok Mountains and of
Kangertluksoak Public Worship on Sunday Saeglek and its
Inhabitants described The Missionaries visit the Esquimaux at
Kikkertarsoak
June 29thWe rose soon after two oclock and rowed out of the
Ikkerasak with a fair wind The sea was perfectly calm and smooth
Brother Kmoch rowed in the small boat along the foot of the mountains of
Kaumayok sometimes going on shore while the large boat was making but
little way keeping out at some distance to avoid the rocks The
outline of this chain of mountains exhibits the most fanciful figures
At various points the rocks descend abruptly into the sea presenting
horrid precipices The strand is covered with a black sand At the
height of about fifty feet from the sea the rocks have veins of red
yellow and green stone running horizontally and parallel and
sometimes in an undulated form Above these they present the appearance
of a magnificent colonade or rather of buttresses supporting a gothic
building varying in height and thickness and here and there
intersected by wide and deep chasms and glens running far inland
between the mountains Loose stones above have in some places the
appearance of statues and the superior region exhibits all kind of
grotesque shapes It is by far the most singular and picturesque chain
of mountains on this coast To the highest part of it we gave the name
of St Pauls as it is not unlike that cathedral when viewed at a
distance with its dome and two towers
Before we left the Kaumayok Brother Kohlmeister landed and found the
beach covered with blocks of stone in colour white and grey like
statuary marble but very hard We now steered for Kangertluksoak a
winterstation of the Esquimaux where several of our people had pitched
their tents
At noon we were off an island called Eingosiarsuk the Little Cup
opposite the Ittiplek a flat piece of ground joining two headlands
over which the northern Esquimaux pass in sledges to Okkak round
Kaumayok Farther towards the NW lies Tuppertalik a high ridge of
mountains which from its appearance we called the Table mountain
having nearly the shape of the mountain so called at the Cape of Good
Hope
To the north lies Nellekartok the outermost island on leaving the
Ikkerasak and the first of the Kangertluksoak islands Behind
Tuppertalik a bay opens called Nappartok a wood a
winterhabitation with a little wood higher up the country about eight
or ten hours drive from Okkak A good harbour for large vessels is said
to be here called Umiakovitannak Broad boatharbour Before the
entrance to Nappartok lies an island Naujartsit the Little
Seagull island Seven or eight miles north of Nappertok a long flat
point runs out terminated by a small island On approaching towards
Kangertluksoak a long island runs parallel with the coast called
Illuektulik a burialplace between which and the main land is a
strait affording good shelter for boats Into this Jonathan intended to
run but the wind being favourable we kept on our course and passed
two islands Kingmiktok Dog island and farther north
Kikkertarsoak a great island which defends the entrance into the
harbour of Kangertluksoak from the sea At ten PM we came to an
anchor in the harbour and were received by our Esquimaux of whom
several families were stationed here as well as by the other
inhabitants with demonstrations of great joy Both the heathen who kept
on the right side of the great bay and our own Christian Esquimaux on
the left fired numberless shots to welcome us Several boats were here
from Kittinek and Nachvak bound to Okkak
Kangertluksoak lies about sixty miles north of Okkak is an agreeable
place and has a good strand and safe anchorage
30th Being Sunday the Missionaries went on shore and visited all the
Christian families by whom they were received with the most lively
expressions of affection and gratitude Many strangers from the opposite
coast had joined them and they all seated themselves in a large circle
on the grass
Nikupsuks wife Louisa who had long ago forsaken the believers was
here and said with much apparent contrition that she was unworthy to
be numbered with them She then seated herself at a little distance from
the rest
The number of the congregation including our boats company amounted
to about fifty Brother Kohlmeister first addressed them by greeting
them from their brethren at Okkak and expressing our joy at finding
them well in health and our hopes that they were all walking worthy of
their Christian profession as a good example to their heathen
neighbours Then the Litany was read and a spirit of true devotion
pervaded the whole assembly
Our very hearts rejoiced in this place which had but lately been a den
of murderers dedicated as it were by the angekoks or sorcerers to
the service of the devil to hear the cheerful voices of converted
heathen most melodiously sounding forth the praises of God and giving
glory to the name of Jesus their Redeemer Peace and cheerful
countenances dwelt in the tents of the believing Esquimaux
Our people had caught a large whitefish and pressed us much to be
their guests which we should have accepted of with pleasure but we
thought it prudent to avail ourselves of the favourable wind and
weather to proceed Instead therefore of dining with them we
presented to each tent a quart of pease which is considered by the
Esquimaux as a great luxury and was received with unbounded
thankfulness
About noon we set sail with a brisk wind at SE for Saeglek The
coast presents here moderately high barren mountains without bays or
islands The wind becoming more violent the rope by which we kept the
skinboat in tow suddenly snapt and set her adrift She was frequently
hid from our view by the height of the waves but we were in no
apprehension about her as these kind of boats are much safer in a high
sea than a European one
At seven PM we arrived at Saeglek and were saluted by the firing of
muskets and bonfires on the hills The Esquimaux have their dwellings on
a small flat island between two of larger size but the strand is bad
and full of sharp shingles There are about five or six winterhouses at
Saeglek containing each about two or three families
July 1st Early two Esquimaux men Joas and Uiverunna came in
their kayaks to pay us a visit They with their families inhabited
some tents we had seen yesterday Brother Kohlmeister spoke seriously to
them on the necessity of conversion especially to Joas who had
Christian parents and as a child was baptized at Okkak He reminded
him of his having been devoted to Jesus from his birth that he
therefore ought not to belong to the unbelievers but to Him who had
created and redeemed him and that the greatest of all the sins he now
committed was his persisting in his determination not to return He
seemed to listen with some humility to the loving and earnest reproof
and exhortations of the Missionary but at last excused himself by
laying the blame upon his mother who kept him back adding that he
still intended to be converted
Our people had meanwhile made a fire and put the pot on to boil pease
but the wind changing Jonathan determined immediately to proceed The
pease had just begun to swell and as the two Esquimaux had presented us
with some fresh meat they had been asked to partake of our meal but
finding themselves thus disappointed they fell to and having greedily
devoured a quantity of the halfboiled pease and filled their gloves
with the rest they took leave and set sail about 11 AM
Hearing from some Esquimaux who made towards us in their kayaks that
the Saeglek people were all on the north side of the island of
Kikkertarsoak we proceeded thither and having doubled the point saw
seven tents full of people Two of them contained families from
Killinek But the violence of the wind was such that we could not stay
in this unsheltered place with safety We therefore worked our way with
the help of the Esquimaux round another point into a roadstead rather
