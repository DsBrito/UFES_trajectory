this human narrative of the West into still another stagethat of the
present when railways are intersecting each other when mills and
factories are being added to the great grain elevators in the West and
when hundreds and thousands of people every year are moving across the
plains where within my own living time the buffalo ranged in their
millions and the red men uncontrolled set up their tepees
NOTE
The tales in this book belong to two different epochs in the life of the
Far West The first five are reminiscent of border days and deedsof
days before the great railway was built which changed a waste into a
fertile field of civilisation The remaining stories cover the period
passed since the Royal NorthWest Mounted Police and the Pullman car
first startled the early pioneer and sent him into the land of the
farther North or drew him into the quiet circle of civic routine and
humdrum occupation

A LODGE IN THE WILDERNESS
HaiYai so bright a day so clear said Mitiahwe as she entered the
big lodge and laid upon a wide low couch covered with soft skins the
fur of a grizzly which had fallen to her mans rifle Haiyai I
wish it would last for everso sweet she added smoothing the fur
lingeringly and showing her teeth in a smile
There will come a great storm Mitiahwe See the birds go south so
soon responded a deep voice from a corner by the doorway
The young Indian wife turned quickly and in a defiant fantastic
moodor was it the inward cry against an impending fate the tragic
future of those who will not see because to see is to suffershe
made some quaint odd motions of the body which belonged to a mysterious
dance of her tribe and with flashing eyes challenged the comely old
woman seated on a pile of deerskins
It is morning and the day will last for ever she said nonchalantly
but her eyes suddenly took on a faraway look half apprehensive half
wondering The birds were indeed going south very soon yet had there
ever been so exquisite an autumn as this had her man ever had so
wonderful a tradeher man with the brown hair blue eyes and fair
strong face
The birds go south but the hunters and buffalo still go north
Mitiahwe urged searchingly looking hard at her motherOanita the
Swift Wing
My dream said that the winter will be dark and lonely that the ice
will be thick the snow deep and that many hearts will be sick because
of the black days and the hunger that sickens the heart answered Swift
Wing
Mitiahwe looked into Swift Wings dark eyes and an anger came upon her
The hearts of cowards will freeze she rejoined and to those that
will not see the sun the world will be dark she added Then suddenly
she remembered to whom she was speaking and a flood of feeling ran
through her for Swift Wing had cherished her like a fledgeling in the
nest till her young white man came from down East Her heart had leapt
up at sight of him and she had turned to him from all the young men of
her tribe waiting in a kind of mist till he at last had spoken to
her mother and then one evening her shawl over her head she had come
along to his lodge
A thousand times as the four years passed by she had thought how good
it was that she had become his wifethe young white mans wife rather
than the wife of Breaking Rock son of White Buffalo the chief who
had four hundred horses and a face that would have made winter and
sour days for her Now and then Breaking Rock came and stood before the
lodge a distance off and stayed there hour after hour and once or
twice he came when her man was with her but nothing could be done
for earth and air and space were common to them all and there was no
offence in Breaking Rock gazing at the lodge where Mitiahwe lived Yet
it seemed as though Breaking Rock was waitingwaiting and hoping
That was the impression made upon all who saw him and even old White
Buffalo the chief shook his head gloomily when he saw Breaking Rock
his son staring at the big lodge which was so full of happiness and
so full also of many luxuries never before seen at a trading post on
the Koonce River The father of Mitiahwe had been chief but because his
three sons had been killed in battle the chieftainship had come to White
Buffalo who was of the same blood and family There were those who said
that Mitiahwe should have been chieftainess but neither she nor her
mother would ever listen to this and so White Buffalo and the tribe
loved Mitiahwe because of her modesty and goodness She was even more to
White Buffalo than Breaking Rock and he had been glad that Dingan the
white manLong Hand he was calledhad taken Mitiahwe for his woman
Yet behind this gladness of White Buffalo and that of Swift Wing and
behind the silent watchfulness of Breaking Rock there was a thought
which must ever come when a white man mates with an Indian maid without
priest or preacher or writing or book or bond
Yet four years had gone and all the tribe and all who came and went
halfbreeds traders and other tribes remarked how happy was the white
man with his Indian wife They never saw anything but light in the eyes
of Mitiahwe nor did the old women of the tribe who scanned her face as
she came and went and watched and waited too for what never camenot
even after four years
Mitiahwe had been so happy that she had not really missed what never
came though the desire to have something in her arms which was part of
them both had flushed up in her veins at times and made her restless
till her man had come home again Then she had forgotten the unseen for
the seen and was happy that they two were alone togetherthat was the
joy of it all so much alone together for Swift Wing did not live with
them and like Breaking Rock she watched her daughters life standing
afar off since it was the unwritten law of the tribe that the wifes
mother must not cross the path or enter the home of her daughters
husband But at last Dingan had broken through this custom and insisted
that Swift Wing should be with her daughter when he was away from home
as now on this wonderful autumn morning when Mitiahwe had been singing
to the Sun to which she prayed for her man and for everlasting days
with him
She had spoken angrily but now because her soul sharply resented the
challenge to her happiness which her mother had been making It was
her own eyes that refused to see the cloud which the sage and bereaved
woman had seen and conveyed in images and figures of speech natural to
the Indian mind
Haiyai she said now with a strange touching sigh breathing in the
words you are right my mother and a dream is a dream also if it be
dreamt three times then is it to be followed and it is true You have
lived long and your dreams are of the Sun and the Spirit She shook a
little as she laid her hand on a buckskin coat of her man hanging by the
lodgedoor then she steadied herself again and gazed earnestly into
her mothers eyes Have all your dreams come true my mother she
asked with a hungering heart There was the dream that came out of
the dark five times when your father went against the Crees and
was wounded and crawled away into the hills and all our warriors
fledthey were but a handful and the Crees like a young forest in
number I went with my dream and found him after many days and it was
after that you were born my youngest and my last There was alsoher
eyes almost closed and the needle and thread she held lay still in her
lapwhen two of your brothers were killed in the drive of the buffalo
Did I not see it all in my dream and follow after them to take them
to my heart And when your sister was carried off was it not my dream
which saw the trail so that we brought her back again to die in peace
her eyes seeing the Lodge whither she was going open to her and the
Sun the Father giving her light and promisefor she had wounded
herself to die that the thief who stole her should leave her to herself
Behold my daughter these dreams have I had and others and I have
lived long and have seen the bright day break into storm and the herds
flee into the far hills where none could follow and hunger come and
Haiyo see the birds flying south said the girl with a gesture
towards the cloudless sky Never since I lived have they gone south so
soon Again she shuddered slightly then she spoke slowly I also have
dreamed and I will follow my dream I dreamedshe knelt down beside
her mother and rested her hands in her mothers lapI dreamed that
there was a wall of hills dark and heavy and far away and that whenever
my eyes looked at them they burned with tears and yet I looked and
looked till my heart was like lead in my breast and I turned from them
to the rivers and the plains that I loved But a voice kept calling to
me Come come Beyond the hills is a happy land The trail is hard
and your feet will bleed but beyond is the happy land And I would
not go for the voice that spoke and at last there came an old man in my
dream and spoke to me kindly and said Come with me and I will show
thee the way over the hills to the Lodge where thou shalt find what thou
hast lost And I said to him I have lost nothing and I would not
go Twice I dreamed this dream and twice the old man came and three
times I dreamed it and then I spoke angrily to him as but now I did
to thee and behold he changed before my eyes and I saw that he was
now become she stopped short and buried her face in her hands for a
moment then recovered herselfBreaking Rock it was I saw before me
and I cried out and fled Then I waked with a cry but my man was beside
me and his arm was round my neck and this dream is it not a foolish
dream my mother
The old woman sat silent clasping the hands of her daughter firmly
and looking out of the wide doorway towards the trees that fringed the
river and presently as she looked her face changed and grew pinched
all at once and Mitiahwe looking at her turned a startled face
towards the river also
Breaking Rock she said in alarm and got to her feet quickly
Breaking Rock stood for a moment looking towards the lodge then came
slowly forward to them Never in all the four years had he approached
this lodge of Mitiahwe who the daughter of a chief should have
married himself the son of a chief Slowly but with long slouching
stride Breaking Rock came nearer The two women watched him without
speaking Instinctively they knew that he brought news that something
had happened yet Mitiahwe felt at her belt for what no Indian
girl would be without and this one was a gift from her man on the
anniversary of the day she first came to his lodge
Breaking Rock was at the door now his beady eyes fixed on Mitiahwes
his figure jerked to its full height which made him even then two
inches less than Long Hand He spoke in a loud voice
The last boat this year goes down the river tomorrow Long Hand your
man is going to his people He will not come back He has had enough of
the Blackfoot woman You will see him no more He waved a hand to the
sky The birds are going south A hard winter is coming quick You will
be alone Breaking Rock is rich He has five hundred horses Your man is
going to his own people Let him go He is no man It is four years and
still there are but two in your lodge How
He swung on his heel with a chuckle in his throat for he thought he had
said a good thing and that in truth he was worth twenty white men His
quick ear caught a movement behind him however and he saw the girl
spring from the lodge door something flashing from her belt But now
the mothers arms were round her with cries of protest and Breaking
Rock with another laugh slipped away swiftly toward the river
That is good he muttered She will kill him perhaps when she goes
to him She will go but he will not stay I have heard
As he disappeared among the trees Mitiahwe disengaged herself from her
mothers arms went slowly back into the lodge and sat down on the
great couch where for so many moons she had lain with her man beside
her
Her mother watched her closely though she moved about doing little
things She was trying to think what she would have done if such a thing
had happened to her if her man had been going to leave her She assumed
that Dingan would leave Mitiahwe for he would hear the voices of his
people calling far away even as the red man who went East into the
great cities heard the prairies and the mountains and the rivers and
his own people calling and came back and put off the clothes of
civilisation and donned his buckskins again and sat in the Medicine
Mans tent and heard the spirits speak to him through the mist and
smoke of the sacred fire When Swift Wing first gave her daughter to the
white man she foresaw the danger now at hand but this was the tribute
of the lower race to the higher andwho could tell White men had left
their Indian wives but had come back again and for ever renounced
the life of their own nations and become great chiefs teaching
useful things to their adopted people bringing up their children as
tribesmenbringing up their children There it was the thing which
called them back the brighteyed children with the colour of the brown
prairie in their faces and their brains so sharp and strong But here
was no child to call Dingan back only the eloquent brave sweet face
of Mitiahwe If he went Would he go Was he going And now that
Mitiahwe had been told that he would go what would she do In her belt
wasbut no that would be worse than all and she would lose Mitiahwe
her last child as she had lost so many others What would she herself
do if she were in Mitiahwes place Ah she would make him stay
somehowby truth or by falsehood by the whispered story in the long
night by her head upon his knee before the lodgefire and her eyes
fixed on his luring him as the Dream lures the dreamer into the far
trail to find the Suns huntingground where the plains are filled
with the deer and the buffalo and the wild horse by the smell of the
cookingpot and the favourite spiced drink in the morning by the child
that ran to him with his bow and arrows and the cry of the hunterbut
there was no child she had forgotten She was always recalling her own
happy early life with her man and the cleanfaced papooses that crowded
round his kneeone wife and many children and the old Harvester of the
Years reaping them so fast till the children stood up as tall as
their father and chief That was long ago and she had had her
sharetwentyfive years of happiness but Mitiahwe had had only four
She looked at Mitiahwe standing still for a moment like one rapt then
suddenly she gave a little cry Something had come into her mind some
solution of the problem and she ran and stooped over the girl and put
both hands on her head
Mitiahwe hearts blood of mine she said the birds go south but
they return What matter if they go so soon if they return soon If the
Sun wills that the winter be dark and he sends the Coldmaker to close
the rivers and drive the wild ones far from the arrow and the gun
yet he may be sorry and send a second summerhas it not been so and
Coldmaker has hurried awayaway The birds go south but they will
return Mitiahwe
I heard a cry in the night while my man slept Mitiahwe answered
looking straight before her and it was like the cry of a birdcalling
calling calling
But he did not hearhe was asleep beside Mitiahwe If he did not wake
surely it was good luck Thy breath upon his face kept him sleeping
Surely it was good luck to Mitiahwe that he did not hear
She was smiling a little now for she had thought of a thing which
would perhaps keep the man here in this lodge in the wilderness but
the time to speak of it was not yet She must wait and see
Suddenly Mitiahwe got to her feet with a spring and a light in her
eyes Haiyai she said with plaintive smiling ran to a corner of the
lodge and from a leather bag drew forth a horseshoe and looked at it
murmuring to herself
The old woman gazed at her wonderingly What is it Mitiahwe she
asked
It is goodluck So my man has said It is the way of his people It is
put over the door and if a dream come it is a good dream and if a bad
thing come it will not enter and if the heart prays for a thing hid
from all the world then it brings goodluck Haiyai I will put it
over the door and then All at once her hand dropped to her side as
though some terrible thought had come to her and sinking to the
floor she rocked her body backward and forward for a time sobbing
But presently she got to her feet again and going to the door of the
lodge fastened the horseshoe above it with a great needle and a string
of buckskin
Oh great Sun she prayed have pity on me and save me I cannot live
alone I am only a Blackfoot wife I am not blood of his blood Give O
great one blood of his blood bone of his bone soul of his soul that
he will say This is mine body of my body and he will hear the cry and
will stay O great Sun pity me The old womans heart beat faster as
she listened The same thought was in the mind of both If there were
but a child bone of his bone then perhaps he would not go or if he
went then surely he would return when he heard his papoose calling in
the lodge in the wilderness
As Mitiahwe turned to her a strange burning light in her eyes Swift
Wing said It is good The white mans Medicine for a white mans wife
But if there were the red mans Medicine too
What is the red mans Medicine asked the young wife as she smoothed
her hair put a string of bright beads around her neck and wound a red
sash round her waist
The old woman shook her head a curious halfmystic light in her eyes
her body drawn up to its full height as though waiting for something
It is an old Medicine It is of winters ago as many as the hairs of the
head I have forgotten almost but it was a great Medicine when there
were no white men in the land And so it was that to every womans
breast there hung a papoose and every woman had her man and the red
men were like leaves in the forestbut it was a winter of winters ago
and the Medicine Men have forgotten and thou hast no child When Long
Hand comes what will Mitiahwe say to him
Mitiahwes eyes were determined her face was set she flushed deeply
then the colour fled What my mother would say I will say Shall the
white mans Medicine fail If I wish it then it will be so and I will
say so
But if the white mans Medicine failSwift Wing made a gesture
toward the door where the horseshoe hung It is Medicine for a white
man will it be Medicine for an Indian
Am I not a white mans wife
But if there were the Sun Medicine also the Medicine of the days long
ago
Tell me If you rememberKai but you do rememberI see it in your
face Tell me and I will make that Medicine also my mother
Tomorrow if I remember itI will think and if I remember it
tomorrow I will tell you my hearts blood Maybe my dream will come to
me and tell me Then even after all these years a papoose
But the boat will go at dawn tomorrow and if he go also
Mitiahwe is young her body is warm her eyes are bright the songs she
sings her tongueif these keep him not and the Voice calls him still
to go then still Mitiahwe shall whisper and tell him
Haiyohush said the girl and trembled a little and put both hands
on her mothers mouth
For a moment she stood so then with an exclamation suddenly turned and
ran through the doorway and sped toward the river and into the path
which would take her to the post where her man traded with the Indians
and had made much money during the past six years so that he could have
had a thousand horses and ten lodges like that she had just left The
distance between the lodge and the post was no more than a mile but
Mitiahwe made a detour and approached it from behind where she could
not be seen Darkness was gathering now and she could see the glimmer
of the light of lamps through the windows and as the doors opened and
shut No one had seen her approach and she stole through a door which
was open at the rear of the warehousing room and went quickly to
another door leading into the shop There was a crack through which she
could see and she could hear all that was said As she came she had
seen Indians gliding through the woods with their purchases and now
the shop was clearing fast in response to the urging of Dingan and his
partner a Scotch halfbreed It was evident that Dingan was at once
abstracted and excited
Presently only two visitors were left a French halfbreed call Lablache
a swaggering vicious fellow and the captain of the steamer Ste Anne
which was to make its last trip south in the morningeven now it would
have to break its way through the young ice Dingans partner dropped
a bar across the door of the shop and the four men gathered about the
fire For a time no one spoke At last the captain of the Ste Anne
said Its a great chance Dingan Youll be in civilisation again and
in a rising town of white peopleGroise ll be a city in five years
and you can grow up and grow rich with the place The Company asked me
to lay it all before you and Lablache here will buy out your share of
the business at whatever your partner and you prove its worth Youre
young youve got everything before you Youve made a name out here for
being the best trader west of the Great Lakes and nows your time Its
none of my affair of course but I like to carry through what Im set
to do and the Company said You bring Dingan back with you The place
is waiting for him and it cant wait longer than the last boat down
Youre ready to step in when he steps out aint you Lablache
Lablache shook back his long hair and rolled about in his pride I
give him cash for his share tonight someone is behin me share yes
It is worth so much I pay and step inI take the place over I take
half the business here and I work with Dingans partner I take your
horses Dingan I take you lodge I take all in your lodgeeveryting
His eyes glistened and a red spot came to each cheek as he leaned
forward At his last word Dingan who had been standing abstractedly
listening as it were swung round on him with a muttered oath and the
skin of his face appeared to tighten Watching through the crack of
the door Mitiahwe saw the look she knew well though it had never been
turned on her and her heart beat faster It was a look that came into
Dingans face whenever Breaking Rock crossed his path or when one or
two other names were mentioned in his presence for they were names of
men who had spoken of Mitiahwe lightly and had attempted to be jocular
about her
As Mitiahwe looked at him now unknown to himself she was conscious
of what that last word of Lablaches meant Everyting meant herself
Lablachewho had neither the good qualities of the white man nor the
Indian but who had the brains of the one and the subtilty of the other
and whose only virtue was that he was a successful trader though he
looked like a mere woodsman with rings in his ears gaily decorated
buckskin coat and moccasins and a furtive smile always on his
lips EverytingHer blood ran cold at the thought of dropping the
lodgecurtain upon this man and herself alone For no other man than
Dingan had her blood run faster and he had made her life blossom She
had seen in many a halfbreeds and in many an Indians face the look
which was now in that of Lablache and her fingers gripped softly the
thing in her belt that had flashed out on Breaking Rock such a short
while ago As she looked it seemed for a moment as though Dingan would
open the door and throw Lablache out for in quick reflection his eyes
ran from the man to the wooden bar across the door
Youll talk of the shop and the shop only Lablache Dingan said
grimly Im not huckstering my home and Id choose the buyer if I was
selling My lodge aint to be bought nor anything in itnot even
the broom to keep it clean of any halfbreeds thatd enter it without
leave
There was malice in the words but there was greater malice in the tone
and Lablache who was bent on getting the business swallowed his ugly
wrath and determined that if he got the business he would get the
lodge also in due time for Dingan if he went would not take the
lodgeor the woman with him and Dingan was not fool enough to stay when
he could go to Groise to a sure fortune
The captain of the Ste Anne again spoke Theres another thing the
Company said Dingan You neednt go to Groise not at once You can
take a month and visit your folks down East and lay in a stock of
homefeelings before you settle down at Groise for good They was
fair when I put it to them that youd mebbe want to do that You tell
Dingan they said that he can have the month glad and grateful and a
free ticket on the railway back and forth He can have it at once they
said
Watching Mitiahwe could see her mans face brighten and take on a look
of longing at this suggestion and it seemed to her that the bird she
heard in the night was calling in his ears now Her eyes went blind a
moment
The game is with you Dingan All the cards are in your hands youll
never get such another chance again and youre only thirty said the
captain
I wish theyd ask me said Dingans partner with a sigh as he looked
at Lablache I want my chance bad though weve done well heregood
gosh yes all through Dingan
The winters they go queeck in Groise said Lablache It is life all
the time trade all the time plenty to do and seeand a bon fortune to
make bagosh
Your old home was in Nove Scotia wasnt it Dingan asked the captain
in a low voice I kem from Connecticut and I was East to my village
las year It was good seein all my old friends again but I kem back
content I kem back full of homefeelins and content Youll like the
trip Dingan Itll do you good Dingan drew himself up with a start
All right I guess Ill do it Lets figure up again he said to his
partner with a reckless air
With a smothered cry Mitiahwe turned and fled into the darkness and
back to the lodge The lodge was empty She threw herself upon the great
couch in an agony of despair
A halfhour went by Then she rose and began to prepare supper Her
face was aflame her manner was determined and once or twice her hand
went to her belt as though to assure herself of something
Never had the lodge looked so bright and cheerful never had she
prepared so appetising a supper never had the great couch seemed so
soft and rich with furs so homelike and so inviting after a long days
work Never had Mitiahwe seemed so good to look at so graceful and
alert and refinedsuffering does its work even in the wild woods with
wild people Never had the lodge such an air of welcome and peace
and home as tonight and so Dingan thought as he drew aside the wide
curtains of deerskin and entered
Mitiahwe was bending over the fire and appeared not to hear him
Mitiahwe he said gently
She was singing to herself to an Indian air the words of a song Dingan
had taught her
Open the door cold is the night and my feet are heavy
Heap up the fire scatter upon it the cones and the scented leaves
Spread the soft robe on the couch for the chief that returns
Bring forth the cup of remembrance
It was like a low recitative and it had a plaintive cadence as of a
dove that mourned
Mitiahwe he said in a louder voice but with a break in it too for
it all rushed upon him all that she had been to himall that had made
the great West glow with life made the air sweeter the grass greener
the trees more companionable and human who it was that had given the
waste places a voice Yetyet there were his own people in the East
there was another life waiting for him there was the life of ambition
and wealth and and homeand children
His eyes were misty as she turned to him with a little cry of surprise
how much natural and how much assumedfor she had heard him enterit
would have been hard to say She was a woman and therefore the daughter
of pretence even when most real He caught her by both arms as she shyly
but eagerly came to him Good girl good little girl he said He
looked round him Well Ive never seen our lodge look nicer than it
does tonight and the fire and the pot on the fire and the smell of
the pinecones and the cedarboughs and the skins and
And everything she said with a queer little laugh as she moved
away again to turn the steaks on the fire Everything He started at the
word It was so strange that she should use it by accident when but a
little while ago he had been ready to choke the wind out of a mans body
for using it concerning herself
It stunned him for a moment for the West and the life apart from the
world of cities had given him superstition like that of the Indians
whose life he had made his own
Herselfto leave her here who had been so much to him As true as the
sun she worshipped her eyes had never lingered on another man since she
came to his lodge and to her mind she was as truly sacredly married
to him as though a thousand priests had spoken or a thousand Medicine
Men had made their incantations She was his woman and he was her man
As he chatted to her telling her of much that he had done that day
and wondering how he could tell her of all he had done he kept looking
round the lodge his eye resting on this or that and everything had its
own personal history had become part of their lodgelife because it
had a use as between him and her and not a conventional domestic place
Every skin every utensil every pitcher and bowl and pot and curtain
had been with them at one time or another when it became of importance
and renowned in the story of their days and deeds
How could he break it to herthat he was going to visit his own people
and that she must be alone with her mother all winter to await his
return in the spring His return As he watched her sitting beside him
helping him to his favourite dish the close companionable trust and
gentleness of her her exquisite cleanness and grace in his eyes he
asked himself if after all it was not true that he would return in
the spring The years had passed without his seriously thinking of this
inevitable day He had put it off and off content to live each hour as
it came and take no real thought for the future and yet behind all was
the warning fact that he must go one day and that Mitiahwe could not go
with him Her mother must have known that when she let Mitiahwe come to
him Of course and after all she would find another mate a better
mate one of her own people
But her hand was in his now and it was small and very warm and
suddenly he shook with anger at the thought of one like Breaking Rock
taking her to his wigwam or Lablachethis roused him to an inward
fury and Mitiahwe saw and guessed the struggle that was going on in
him and she leaned her head against his shoulder and once she raised
his hand to her lips and said My chief
Then his face cleared again and she got him his pipe and filled it and
held a coal to light it and as the smoke curled up and he leaned
back contentedly for the moment she went to the door drew open the
curtains and stepping outside raised her eyes to the horseshoe Then
she said softly to the sky O Sun great Father have pity on me for
I love him and would keep him And give me bone of his bone and one
to nurse at my breast that is of him O Sun pity me this night and be
near me when I speak to him and hear what I say
What are you doing out there Mitiahwe Dingan cried and when she
entered again he beckoned her to him What was it you were saying Who
were you speaking to he asked I heard your voice
