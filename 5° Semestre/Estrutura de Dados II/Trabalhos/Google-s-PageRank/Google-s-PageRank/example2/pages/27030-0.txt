What are the implications for all the professionals of the print media authors
booksellers journalists librarians printers publishers translators etc
How do they see the breaker which is beating down on them and the storm that
the Internet is bringing into their professional life These are the questions I
will try to answer in the following pages
More and more publications have both an electronic version and a paper version
and in some cases both can be ordered online Numerous texts are available
online in digital libraries Many of these texts also have a paper version the
cybernaut can buy if he prefers reading 500 pages lying on his sofa instead of
reading them on the screen of his computer Some texts or magazines are
available online only
More and more newspapers and magazines have a website on which their readers can
find the full text or abstracts of the latest issue archives giving access to
the previous issues dossiers on various topics etc More and more library
catalogs are available online And most sites offer hyperlinks to other
websites or documents on related subjects In short the Internet has become an
essential tool for getting information having access to documents and
broadening our knowledge
I will examine the interaction of the print media and the Internet in the
following areas bookstores publishers press libraries digital libraries and
catalogs I shall also include the contributions of the media professionals who
answered my inquiry about 1 the way they see the relationship between the
print media and the Internet 2 what the use of the Internet has brought in
their professional life andor the life of their companyorganization and 3
how they see their professional future or the future in general with the
Internet I express here my warmest thanks to all those who replied to my
inquiry
I will also comment on the future trends regarding intellectual property
digitization multimedia convergence and the information society A selection of
websites is also available Some of the information included here is probably
already obsolete Never mind The world of the Internet is fastmoving and
evolves constantly  that is one of its many assets
This study follows a PhD I completed in 199899 at the University of the
Sorbonne Ecole pratique des hautes Atudes Paris France Although the key
ideas are the same it is not the translation of the French study which was
Francophoneoriented New websites and new contributions from people belonging
to the Englishspeaking and the international community have been included here
Originally I worked as a librarian in Europe and in the Middle East under
contract to set up libraries andor computerize catalogs More recently I have
been contributing to the preparation of publications as a writer translator
editor or indexor Since 1996 I have been working mainly for the International
Labour Office ILO Geneva Switzerland As I am fascinated by languages I
also wrote a study about Multilingualism on the Web
2 THE INTERNET
In this chapter

InfoPoor  23 The Web First English then Multilingual
21 The Internet and the Other Media
Since a few years ago the Internet has become integrated into our daily life
and people have gotten connected at home at work or in their university At the
end of 1997 the number of Internet users was estimated at 90 or 100 million
with one million new users every month In the year 2000 the number of Internet
users will be over 300 million
Does the Internet compete directly with television and reading In Quebec where
307 of the population is connected a poll taken in March 1998 for the
cybermagazine Branchezvous showed that 288 of connected Quebeckers were
watching television less than before Only 121 were reading less As stated by
the French Canadian magazine MultimAdium in its article of April 2 1998 it was
rather encouraging for the Ministry of Culture and Communications which has the
double task of furthering the development of information highways and
reading
The Internet has become the medium of choice for many news consumers in many
cases matching and occasionally surpassing traditional forms of media according
to a survey conducted in February 1998 for MSNBC on the Internet by Market
Facts
In an article of Internet Wire February 1998 Merrill Brown editorinchief
of online MSNBC wrote
The Internet news usage behavior pattern is shaping up similar to broadcast
television in terms of weekday use and is used more than cable television
newspapers and magazines during that same period of time Additionally on
Saturdays the Internet is used more than broadcast television radio or
newspapers and on a weekly basis has nearly the same hours of use as
newspapers
The corresponding number of hours per week are 24 hours for magazines 35
hours for the Internet 36 hours for newspapers 45 hours for radio 5 hours
for cable TV and 57 hours for broadcast TV
When interviewed in Autumn 1997 by FranAois Lemelin chief editor of LAlbum
the official publication of the Club Macintosh de QuAbec JeanPierre Cloutier
editor of the Chroniques de CybArie explained
I think the medium the Internet is going to continue being essential and
then give birth to original precise specific services bywhich time we will
have found an economic model of viability For information cybermedias like the
Chroniques de CybArie as well as for infoservices community and online public
services electronic commerce distance learning the postmodern policy which
is going to change the elected representativesprincipals in fact everything
is coming around
Concerning the relationship with other media I think we need to look backwards
Contrary to the words of alarmists in previous times radio didnt kill music or
the entertainment industry any more than the cinema did Television didnt kill
radio or cinema Nor did home videos When a new medium arrives it makes some
room for itself the others adjust there is a transition period then a
convergence
What is different with the Internet is the interactive dimension of the medium
and its possible impact We are still thinking about that we are watching to
see what happens
Also as a medium the Net allows the emergence of new concepts in the field of
communication and on the human level too  even for nonconnected people I
remember yes I am that old when McLuhan arrived at the end of the sixties
with his concept of global village basing itself on television and telephone
and he was predicting data exchange between computers There were people in
Africa without television and telephone who read and understood McLuhan And
McLuhan changed things in their vision of the world The Internet has the same
effect It gives rise to some thinking on communication private life freedom
of expression the values we are attached to and those we are ready to get rid
of and it is this effect which makes it such a powerful important medium
The Web must not only give the necessary space to all languages but it must also
respect all cultures During the Symposium on Multimedia Convergence organized
by the International Labour Organization ILO Geneva Switzerland in January
1997 Shinji Matsumoto General Secretary of the Musicians Union of Japan
MUJ declared
It is not only in developing countries but in advanced countries as well that
we need to maintain our traditions Japan is quite receptive to foreign culture
and foreign technology  Foreign culture is pouring into Japan and in
fact the domestic market is being dominated by foreign products Despite this
when it comes to preserving and further developing Japanese culture there has
been insufficient support from the Government  With the development of
information networks the earth is getting smaller and it is wonderful to be
able to make cultural exchanges across vast distances and to deepen mutual
understanding among people We have to remember to respect national cultures and
social systems
The Technorealism website first appeared on the Web on March 12 1998 According
to the website technorealism is an attempt to assess the social and political
implications of technologies so that we might all have more control over the
shape of our future The heart of the technorealist approach involves a
continuous critical examination of how technologies  whether cuttingedge or
mundane  might help or hinder us in the struggle to improve the quality of our
personal lives our communities and our economic social and political
structures
The eight principles of Technorealism Overview have been signed by over 1472
people between March 12 and August 20 1998 Here are the first three
a Technologies are not neutral
A great misconception of our time is the idea that technologies are completely
free of bias  that because they are inanimate artifacts they dont promote
certain kinds of behaviors over others In truth technologies come loaded with
both intended and unintended social political and economic leanings Every
tool provides its users with a particular manner of seeing the world and
specific ways of interacting with others It is important for each of us to
consider the biases of various technologies and to seek out those that reflect
our values and aspirations
b The Internet is revolutionary but not Utopian
The Net is an extraordinary communications tool that provides a range of new
opportunities for people communities businesses and government Yet as
cyberspace becomes more populated it increasingly resembles society at large
in all its complexity For every empowering or enlightening aspect of the wired
life there will also be dimensions that are malicious perverse or rather
ordinary
c Government has an important role to play on the electronic frontier
Contrary to some claims cyberspace is not formally a place or jurisdiction
separate from Earth While governments should respect the rules and customs that
have arisen in cyberspace and should not stifle this new world with inefficient
regulation or censorship it is foolish to say that the public has no
sovereignty over what an errant citizen or fraudulent corporation does online
As the representative of the people and the guardian of democratic values the
state has the right and responsibility to help integrate cyberspace and
conventional society
Technology standards and privacy issues for example are too important to be
entrusted to the marketplace alone Competing software firms have little
interest in preserving the open standards that are essential to a fully
functioning interactive network Markets encourage innovation but they do not
necessarily insure the public interest
22 The InfoRich and the InfoPoor
There is a close correlation between economic and social development and access
to telecommunications Access to new communication technologies expands much
more rapidly in the North than in the South and there are many more web servers
in North America and in Europe than on the other continents Twothirds of the
Internet users live in the United States where 40 of households are equipped
with a computer a percentage that we also find in Denmark Switzerland and
Netherlands The percentage is 30 in Germany 25 in United Kingdom and 20
for most industrialized countries
The statistics of March 1998 on the percentage of connections per number of
inhabitants available in the Computer Industry Almanach CIA a reference
document on the evolution of cyberspace show that Finland is the most connected
country in the world with 25 of its population connected followed by Norway
23 and Iceland 227 The United States is in fourth place with 20 Eleven
countries in the world have a proportion of Internet users above 10 and
Switzerland is eleventh with 107
Regarding the global percentage the statistics of end 1997 of the Computer
Industry Almanach  which take into consideration the connections at home at
work and in academic institutions  show that the United States is still
considerably ahead with 5468 of the global percentage followed by Japan
797 the United Kingdom 583 and Canada 433 The survey also shows
that the US lead is constantly decreasing  it went from 80 in 1991 to less
than 65 in 1994 with prospects of 50 in 1998 and less than 40 in 2000
Nevertheless if we consider the whole planet universal access to information
highways is far from the reality Regarding basic telephony teledensity varies
from more than 60 phone lines per 100 inhabitants in the richest countries to
less than one in the poorest countries Fifty per cent of phone lines in the
world are in northern America and western Europe Half of the worlds population
has never used a phone
In the developing countries it is unlikely that Internet connections will use
traditional phone lines as there are other technological solutions The
developing countries equipment rate for digital lines is equivalent to the rate
of industrialized countries The growth in mobile telephony is also spectacular
The solution could be brought by cellular radiotelephony and satellite
connection
However the demarcation between the inforich and the infopoor does not
systematically follow the demarcation between the socalled developed and
developing countries Access to information technology in the socalled rich
countries is also rather uneven Some developing countries such as Malaysia or
a number of countries in Latin America have a very dynamic telecommunication
policy In the documents prepared for the second Conference on the Development
of Telecommunications in the World organized by the International
Telecommunication Union ITU from March 23 to April 1 1998 in Valletta Malta
it was stated that several developing countries such as Botswana China Chile
Thailand Hungary Ghana and Mauritius succeeded in extending the density and
the quality of their phone services during the last three years On the other
hand the situation was getting worse for the poorest countries
During the ILO Symposium on Multimedia Convergence held in January 1997 Wilfred
Kiboro Managing Director and Chief Executive of Nation Printers and Publishers
Ltd Kenya stated
Information technology needs to be brought to affordable levels I have a dream
that perhaps in our lifetime in Africa we will see villagers being able to
access the Internet from their rural villages where today there is no water
and no electricity We hope they will be able to watch Sky News on their
portable televisions but maybe this is just a dream
For the media particularly there is an abyss between the inforich and the
infopoor In many African countries the circulation of newspapers is very
low compared to the population figures and each copy is read by at least twenty
people According to Wilfred Kiboro who noticed in his company a drop in the
newspapers price thanks to multimedia convergence distribution costs could
drop with the use of a printing system by satellite which could do away with the
need for transporting newspapers by truck throughout the country
Nevertheless multimedia convergence in particular and the globalization of the
economy in general has put the developing countries in a position of inferiority
because the printing and radiotelevision broadcasting means are in the hands of
a few main western groups Cultural problems exist alongside economic problems
Paradoxically information relating to Africa and broadcast for Africans doesnt
come from the African continent but is broadcast by westerners who transmit
their own vision of Africa without any real perception of its economic and
social situation
Some developing countries  such as Mauritania  rely on the Web to regain
prestige as explained by Emmanuel Genty and JeanPierre Turquoi in the daily
French newspaper Le Monde of March 30 1998 Mauritania presented its Government
Official Site at the headquarters of the World Bank during the Days of the
Consultative Group for Mauritania JournAes du Groupe consultatif pour la
Mauritanie on March 2527 1998 This event took place following the media
focus on the continued existence of slavery in this country despite the fact
that it has been officially abolished for years The website is intended to be
the countrys shop window for tourists and foreign investors On the other hand
the use of the Internet inside the country is heavily regulated by the Post and
Telecommunication Office Office des postes et des tAlAcommunications  OPT
which is the national operator And things are made even more difficult because
of prohibitive connection costs  three times the cost of a local phone call
China is also discovering digital information through the China Wide Web which
is the countrys national Internet The number of its subscribers jumped from
100000 in 1996 to 600000 in 1997 Set up by the China Internet Corporation
CIC a company based in Hong Kong the China Wide Web is a business and
information network more or less cut off from the rest of the world and
screened and controlled by the Chinese authorities
The abyss between the inforich and the infopoor is not only the one
dividing developed and developing countries In any country there are gaps
between the rich and the poor the employed and the unemployed the people who
belong to society and the people who are rejected by it As a new communication
medium the Internet can be a way out of the abyss Anyone can have an email
address on the Net Anyone can use the Web in the public library or in the
premises of some association to find information or look for a job
23 The Web First English Then Multilingual
In the beginning the Web was nearly 100 English which can be easily explained
by the fact that the Internet was created in the United States as a network set
up by the Pentagon in 1969 before spreading to US governmental agencies and to
universities After the creation of the World Wide Web in 198990 by Tim
BernersLee at the CERN European Laboratory for Particle Physics Geneva
Switzerland and the distribution of the first browser Mosaic the ancestor of
Netscape from November 1993 onwards the Web too began to spread first in
the US thanks to considerable investments made by the government then around
North America and then to the rest of the world
The fact that there are many more Internet surfers in the US and Canada than in
any other country is due to different factors  these countries are among the
leaders in the latest computing and communication technologies and hardware and
software as well as local phone communications are much cheaper there than in
the rest of the world
In Hugues Henrys article La francophonie en quAate didentitA sur le Web
Francophony in search of identity on the Web published in the Dossiers of the
daily cybermagazine MultimAdium JeanPierre Cloutier author of Chroniques de
CybArie a weekly cybermagazine widely read in the Frenchspeaking Internet
community explained
In Quebec I am spending about 120 hours per month online My Internet access
is 30 Canadian if I add my allinclusive phone bill which is about 40 with
various optional services the total cost of my connection is 70 per month I
leave you to guess what the price would be in France in Belgium or in
Switzerland where the local communications are billed by the minute for the
same number of hours online
It follows that many European surfers spend much less time on the Web than they
would like or choose to surf at night to cut their expenses At the end of
1998 in several countries Italy Germany France etc surfers began to
boycott the Internet for one day to make phone companies aware of their needs
and give them a special monthly rate
In 1997 Babel  a joint initiative from Alis Technologies and the Internet
Society ran the first major study of the actual distribution of languages on
the Internet The results are published in the Web Languages Hit Parade dated
June 1997 and the languages listed in order of usage are English 823
German 40 Japanese 16 French 15 Spanish 11 Swedish 11 and Italian
10
To reach as large an audience as possible the solution is to create bilingual
trilingual even multilingual sites The website of the Belgian daily newspaper
Le Soir presents the newspaper in six languages French English Dutch German
Italian and Spanish The French Club des poA tes Club of Poets a French site
dedicated to poetry presents its site in English Spanish and Portuguese
EMailPlanet a free email address provider provides a menu in six languages
English Finnish French Italian Portuguese and Spanish
As the Web quickly spreads worldwide more and more operators of
Englishlanguage sites which are concerned by the internationalization of the
Web recognize that although English may be the main international language for
exchanges of all kinds not everyone in the world reads English
Since December 1997 any Internet surfer can use AltaVista Translation which
translates English web pages up to three pages at the same time into French
German Italian Portuguese and Spanish and vice versa The Internet surfer
can also buy and use Web translation software In both cases he will get a
usable but imperfect machinetranslated result which may be very helpful but
will never have the same quality as a translation prepared by a human translator
with special knowledge of the subject and the contents of the site
The increase in multilingual sites will make it possible to include more diverse
languages on the Internet And more free translation software will improve
communication among everyone in the international Internet community
In Web embraces language translation an article published in ZDNN ZD Network
News of July 21 1998 Martha L Stone explained
This year the number of new nonEnglish websites is expected to outpace the
growth of new sites in English as the cyber world truly becomes a World Wide
Web  According to Global Reach the fastest growing groups of Web newbies
are nonEnglishspeaking Spanish 224 percent Japanese 123 percent German
14 percent and French 10 percent An estimated 557 million people access the
Web whose native language is not English  Only 6 percent of the world
population speaks English as a native language 16 percent speak Spanish while
about 80 percent of all web pages are in English
Robert Ware is the creator of OneLook Dictionaries a fast finder for 2061220
words in 432 dictionaries as of December 10 1998 in various fields business
computerInternet medical miscellaneous religion science sports
technology general and slang In his email to me of September 2 1998 he
wrote
An interesting thing happened earlier in the history of the Internet and I
think I learned something from it
In 1994 I was working for a college and trying to install a software package on
a particular type of computer I located a person who was working on the same
problem and we began exchanging email Suddenly it hit me the software was
written only 30 miles away but I was getting help from a person half way around
the world Distance and geography no longer mattered
OK this is great But what is it leading to I am only able to communicate in
English but fortunately the other person could use English as well as German
which was his mother tongue The Internet has removed one barrier distance but
with that comes the barrier of language
It seems that the Internet is moving people in two quite different directions at
the same time The Internet initially based on English is connecting people
all around the world This is further promoting a common language for people to
use for communication But it is also creating contact between people of
different languages and creates a greater interest in multilingualism A common
language is great but in no way replaces this need
So the Internet promotes both a common language AND multilingualism The good
news is that it helps provide solutions The increased interest and need is
creating incentives for people around the world to create improved language
courses and other assistance and the Internet is providing fast and inexpensive
opportunities to make them available

Multilingualism on the Web
3 ONLINE BOOKSTORES
In this chapter
31 Books a Good Product to Sell Online  32 Online Bookstores Some
Examples  33 Digital Books
31 Books A Good Product to Sell OnLine
Many traditional bookstores  with booksellers windows books piled upon
display shelves or lined up on shelves around the shop  have created online
bookstores on the Internet  for example Barnes  Noble barnesandnoblecom in
the United States Chapters Chaptersglobe in Canada Waterstones in the
United Kingdom etc Other bookstores have no walls and no windows looking out
on the street They are only online for example Amazoncom in the United
States Internet Bookshop in the United Kingdom Their window is their website
and all the transactions are made through the Internet
These online stores dont sell only books but also CDs audiobooks DVDs
computer games sheet music movies on VHS console and CDROM software games
etc As we are dealing here with the relationship between the print media and
the Internet we shall focus on books only
The booklover searches the online bookstores catalog on his screen In most
cases searches are possible by author title and subject The home page of the
bookstore often looks like a literary magazine so the booklover can be kept
informed of the latest current events For someone who does not like queuing in
his favorite library on a Saturday afternoon the Web can bring a lot of relief
He can leaf through short descriptions and extracts of books order online
the books he is interested in and pay with his credit card The only delay
encountered is the time necessary for the book to be shipped to his house Such
a person is looking forward to being equipped with a digital book which will
appear in 1999
Jeff Bezos created Amazoncom in July 1995 after a market study which led him
to conclude that books were the best products to sell on the Internet
In Spring 1994 he drew up a list of 20 products that could be sold on the Net
from clothing to gardening tools and then researched his top five CDs videos
computer hardware computer software and books
I used a whole bunch of criteria to evaluate the potential of each product but
among the main criteria was the size of the relative markets Books I found
out were an 82 billion market worldwide The price point was another major
criterion I wanted a lowpriced product I reasoned that since this was the
first purchase many people would make online it had to be nonthreatening in
size A third criterion was the range of choice there were 3 million items in
the book category and only a tenth of that in CDs for example This was
important because the wider the choice the more the organizing and selection
capabilities of the computer could be put in good use
However Jeff Bezos doesnt think traditional bookstores are going to close any
time soon as quoted by Bruce Knecht in The Wall Street Journal of May 16 1996
He regularly hangs out at the Elliott Bay Book Co a sprawling independent
bookstore in downtown Seattle which has exposed brick walls a cafe and lots of
friendly salespeople And he talks about how books creak in that nice kind of
way We are trying to make the shopping experience just as fun as going to the
book store he says but theres some things we cant do
32 OnLine Bookstores Some Examples
Amazoncom is the largest online bookstore with instant access to 3 million
titles authoritative reviews author interviews excerpts customer reviews
and book recommendations It is an Internet retailer of books music and other
informationbased products that offers services traditional retailers cannot
lower prices selection and a wealth of product information
Today Amazoncom offers 3 million books CDs audiobooks DVDs computer games
more than 14 times as many titles as the large chain superstores  to more to 3
million people in more than 160 countries Businesses can do things on the Web
that simply cannot be done any other way says Jeff Bezos We are changing the
way people buy books and music
Any booklover can post his own reviews of books and read others He can read
interviews with authors and blurbs and excerpts from books He can search for
books by author subject title ISBN or publication date Prices are
discounted with savings of 2040 on 400000 titles 40 on selected feature
books 30 on hardcovers and 20 on paperbacks The client usually receives
the books within a week If he requests it he will receive an email announcing
a new book by an author he likes or on a subject he is particularly interested
in He can also choose from 44 subjects and he will be sent a monthly email
reviewing books Amazoncoms editors consider particularly interesting
Success magazine of July 1998 wrote that Amazoncom is the universal model for
successful Internet retailing aka etailing Computer Weekly of July 24
1997 defined it as undoubtedly the most quoted example of goahead electronic
commerce and still the showcase for Internet trading and PC World of July 1997
stated In the summer of 1995 Jeff Bezos and his wife MacKenzie decided to
risk it all on the Internet They opened a cyberstore named Amazoncom
Two years later  its one of the World Wide Webs most successful small
businesses Few who have braved the wilds of the Web have achieved
Amazoncomstyle success
Such success is explained by Jeff Bezos in Amazoncoms press kit
Our leadership position comes from our obsessive focus on customers
Customers want selection ease of use and the lowest prices These are the
elements we work hard to provide We continued to improve our customer
experience during the quarter the second quarter 1998 with the opening of our
music store our easiertonavigate store layout and our expansion into the
local UK and German book markets These initiatives will continue to require
aggressive investment and entail significant execution challenges
Amazoncoms press release of June 8 1998 gives some information about its
Associates Program
The Amazoncom Associates Program allows website owners to easily participate
in hasslefree electronic commerce by recommending books on their site and
referring visitors to Amazoncom In return participants earn referral fees of
up to 15 percent of the sales they generate Amazoncom handles the secure
online ordering customer service and shipping and sends weekly email sales
reports Enrollment in the program is free and participants can be up and
running the same day
Associates range from large and small businesses to nonprofits authors
publishers personal home pages and more The popularity of the program is
reflected in the range of additions to the Associates Community in the past few
months Adobe InfoBeat Kemper Funds PR Newswire Travelocity Virtual
Vineyards and Xoom
The program surpassed 60000 members in June 1998
Barnes  Noble the giant US bookseller is the leading operator of book
superstores in America with 481 stores nationwide in 48 states It also
operates 520 BDalton bookstores in shopping malls Barnes  Noble stores offer
a selection of more than 175000 titles from more than 20000 publishers with an
emphasis on small independent publishers and university presses The company
also publishes books under its own imprint for exclusive sale through its retail
stores and nationwide mailorder catalogs
Barnes  Noble entered the world of online commerce in early 1997 launching
its America Online site in March 1997  it is the exclusive bookseller to
America Online AOLs more than 12 million subscribers  and launching its new
website barnesandnoblecom in May 1997 The site includes personalized content
recommendations from authors and editors and more than 630000 titles available
for immediate shipping with deep discounts 30 off all instock hardcovers
20 off all instock paperbacks 40 off select titles and up to 90 off bargain
books It has exclusive partnerships with more than 12000 websites through its
Affiliate Network including CNN Interactive Lycos and ZDNet
On May 27 1998 barnesandnoblecom launched a significantly enhanced version of
its ecommerce website The new site features Express Lane oneclick ordering a
new design and navigation improved book search capabilities and expanded
product offerings  including an online software superstore In the press
release of the same day Jeff Killeen chief operating officer stated
Through our first year in business we have listened intently to what our
customers have asked for and believe we have delivered a vastly superior product
based on those requests  Innovation based on customerfocus has been the
hallmark of our success and we see our new site as proofpositive of our
commitment to be the leader in online bookselling and related products Were
also extremely excited to have Intel a leader in the technology products
category open its SoftwareForPCscom site at barnesandnoblecom
The opening of barnesandnoblecom sparked a fierce price war in a lowmargin
business It now competes directly with the main online bookstore Amazoncom
Because of this competition Amazoncom came to be known as Amazontoast Jeff
Bezos CEO of Amazoncom doesnt fear the competition though In Success of
July 1998 he told journalist Lesley Hazleton
The gap has increased rather than decreased We went from 60 million
annualized sales revenue in May to 260 million by the end of the year and from
340000 customers to 15 million 58 percent of them repeat customers  all that
in the context of Amazontoast Were doing more than eight times the sales of
Barnes  Noble And were not a stationary target We were blessed with a
twoyear head start and our goal is to increase that gap
Located in United Kingdom Internet Bookshop iBS is the largest online
bookstore in Europe The main English bookstore Waterstones also launched its
electronic bookstore with a catalog of 14 million titles
In Fall 1998 Chapters the main Canadian bookseller together with the daily
newspaper The Globe and Mail Toronto Canada opened their cyberbookstore
Chaptersglobecom the online destination for Canadian booklovers A new
online bookstore is also expected from Bertelsmann one of the largest media
companies in the world with headquarters in Germany The companies of the
