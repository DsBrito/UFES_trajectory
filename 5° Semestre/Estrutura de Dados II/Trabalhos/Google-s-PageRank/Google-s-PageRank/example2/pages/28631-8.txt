By degrees during her long and lonely years at Charlock House Lady
Channice had at first tentatively then with a growing assurance in her
limited sphere of action moved away all the ugliest most trivial
things tattered brocade and gilt footstools faded antimacassars
dismal groups of birds and butterflies under glass cases When she sat
alone in the evening after Augustine as child or boy had gone to bed
the ghostly glimmer of the birds the furtive glitter of a glass eye
here and there had seemed to her quite dreadful The removal of the
cases they were large and heavy and Mrs Bray the housekeeper had
looked grimly disapprovingwas her crowning act of courage and ever
since their departure she had breathed more freely It had been easier
to dispose of all the little colonies of faded photographs that stood on
cabinets and tables they were photographs of her husbands family and
of his familys friends people most of whom were quite unknown to her
and their continued presence in the abandoned house was due to
indifference not affection no one had cared enough about them to put
them away far less to look at them After looking at them for some
yearsthese girls in court dress of a bygone fashion huntsmen holding
crops sashed babies and matrons in caps or tiarasLady Channice had
cared enough to put them away She had not either to ask for Mrs
Brays assistance or advice for this a fact which was a relief for
Mrs Bray was a rather dismal being and reminded her indeed of the
stuffed birds in the removed glass cases With her own hands she
incarcerated the photographs in the drawers of a heavily carved bureau
and turned the keys upon them
The only ornaments now were the pale roses the books and above her
writingdesk a little picture that she had brought with her a
watercolour sketch of her old home painted by her mother many years
ago
So the room looked very bare It almost looked like the parlour of a
convent with a little more austerity whitened walls and a few thick
velvet and gilt lives of the saints on the tables the likeness would
have been complete The house itself was conventual in aspect and Lady
Channice as she stood there in the quiet light at the window looked
not unlike a nun were it not for her crown of pale gold hair that shone
in the dark room and seemed like the roses to bring into it the
brightness of an outer happier world
She was a tall woman of forty her ample form her wide bosom the
falling folds of her black dress her loosely girdled waist suggesting
with the cloistral analogies the mournful benignity of a bereaved
Madonna Seen as she stood there leaning her head to watch her sons
approach she was an almost intimidating presence black still and
stately But when the door opened and the young man came in when not
moving to meet him she turned her head with a slight smile of welcome
all intimidating impressions passed away Her face rather as it
turned under its crown of gold was the intimidated face It was
curiously young pure flawless as though its youth and innocence had
been preserved in some crystal medium of prayer and silence and if the
nunlike analogies failed in their aweinspiring associations they
remained in the associations of unconscious pathos and unconscious
appeal Amabel Channices face like her form was long and delicately
ample its pallor that of a flower grown in shadow the mask a little
overlarge for the features Her eyes were small beautifully shaped
slightly slanting upwards their light grey darkened under golden
lashes the brows definitely though palely marked Her mouth was pale
coralcolour and the small upper lip lifting when she smiled as she
was smiling now showed teeth of an infantile milky whiteness The
smile was charming timid tentative ingratiating like a young girls
and her eyes were timid too and a little wild
Have you had a good read she asked her son He had a book in his
hand
Very thanks But it is getting chilly down there in the meadow And
what a lot of frogs there are in the ditch said Augustine smiling
they were jumping all over the place
Oh as long as they werent toads said Lady Channice her smile
lighting in response When I came here first to live there were so many
toads in the stone areas you know under the gratings in front of the
cellar windows You cant imagine how many It used quite to terrify me
to look at them and I went to the front of the house as seldom as
possible I had them all taken away finally in basketsnot killed
you know poor thingsbut just taken and put down in a field a mile
off I hope they didnt starvebut toads are very intelligent arent
they one always associates them with fairytales and princes
She had gone to the teatable while she spoke and was pouring the
boiling water into the teapot Her voice had pretty flutelike ups and
downs in it and a questioning upward cadence at the end of sentences
Her upper lip her smile the run of her speech all would have made one
think her humorous were it not for the strain of nervousness that one
felt in her very volubility
Her son lent her a kindly but rather vague attention while she talked to
him about the toads and his eye as he stood watching her make the tea
was also vague He sat down presently as if suddenly remembering why he
had come in and it was only after a little interval of silence in
which he took his cup from his mothers hands that something else
seemed to occur to him as suddenly a late arriving suggestion from her
speech
What a horribly gloomy place you must have found it
Her eyes turning on him quickly lost in an instant their uncertain
gaiety
Gloomy Is it gloomy Do you feel it gloomy here Augustine
Oh well no not exactly he answered easily You see Ive always
been used to it You werent
As she said nothing to this seeming at a loss for any reply he went on
presently to talk of other things of the book he had been reading a
heavy metaphysical tome of books that he intended to read of a letter
that he had received that morning from the Eton friend with whom he was
going up to Oxford for his first term His mother listened showing a
careful interest usual with her but after another little silence she
said suddenly
I think its a very nice place Charlock House Augustine Your father
wouldnt have wanted me to live here if hed imagined that I could find
it gloomy you know
Oh of course not said the young man in an impassive pleasant
voice
He has always in everything been so thoughtful for my comfort and
happiness said Lady Channice
Augustine did not look at her his eyes were fixed on the sky outside
and he seemed to be reflectingthough not over her words
So that I couldnt bear him ever to hear anything of that sort Lady
Channice went on that either of us could find it gloomy I mean You
wouldnt ever say it to him would you Augustine There was a note at
once of urgency and appeal in her voice
Of course not since you dont wish it her son replied
I ask you just because it happens that your father is coming Lady
Channice said tomorrowand you see if you had this in your mind
you might have said something He is coming to spend the afternoon
He looked at her now steadily still pleasantly but his colour rose
Really he said
Isnt it nice I do hope that it will be fine these Autumn days are so
uncertain if only the weather holds up we can have a walk perhaps
Oh I think it will hold up Will there be time for a walk
He will be here soon after lunch and I think stay on to tea
He didnt stay on to tea the last time did he
No not last time he is so very busy its quite three years since we
have had that nice walk over the meadows and he likes that so much
She was trying to speak lightly and easily And it must be quite a year
since you have seen him
Quite said Augustine I never see him hardly but here you know
He was still making his attempt at pleasantness but something hard and
strained had come into his voice and as with a sort of helplessness
her resources exhausted his mother sat silent he went on glancing at
her as if with the sudden resolution he also wanted to make very sure
of his way
You like seeing him more than anything dont you though you are
separated
Augustine Channice talked a great deal to his mother about outside
things such as philosophy but of personal things of their relation to
the world to each other to his father he never spoke So that his
speaking now was arresting
His mother gazed at him Separated We have always been the best of
friends
Of course I meanthat youve never cared to live
togetherIncompatibility I suppose Only Augustine did not smile
he looked steadily at his mother I should think that since you are so
fond of him youd like seeing him oftener I should think that since he
is the best of friends he would want to come oftener you know
When he had said these words he flushed violently It was an echo of his
mothers flush And she sat silent finding no words
Mother said Augustine forgive me That was impertinent of me Its
no affair of mine
She thought so too apparently for she found no words in which to tell
him that it was his affair Her hands clasped tightly in her lap her
eyes downcast she seemed shrunken together overcome by his tactless
intrusion
Forgive me Augustine repeated
The supplication brought her the resource of words again Of course
dear It is onlyI cant explain it to you It is very complicated
But though it seems so strange to youto everybody I knowit is
just that though we dont live together and though I see so little of
your father I do care for him very very much More than for anybody in
the worldexcept you of course dear Augustine
Oh dont be polite to me he said and smiled More than for anybody
in the world stick to it
She could but accept the amendment so kindly and apparently so
lightly pressed upon her and she answered him with a faint a grateful
smile saying in a low voiceYou see dear he is the noblest person
I have ever known Tears were in her eyes Augustine turned away his
own
They sat then for a little while in silence the mother and son
Her eyes downcast her hands folded in an attitude that suggested some
inner dedication Amabel Channice seemed to stay her thoughts on the
vision of that nobility And though her son was near her the thoughts
were far from him
It was characteristic of Augustine Channice when he mused to gaze
straight before him whatever the object might be that met his unseeing
eyes The object now was the high Autumnal sky outside crossed only
here and there by a drifting fleet of clouds
The light fell calmly upon the mother and son and in their stillness
their contemplation the two faces were like those on an old canvas
preserved from time and change in the trancelike immutability of art
In colour the two heads chimed though Augustines hair was vehemently
gold and there were undertones of brown and amber in his skin But the
oval of Lady Channices face grew angular in her sons broader and more
defiant so that palely darkly white and gold on their deep
background the two heads emphasized each others character by contrast
Augustines lips were square and scornful his nose ruggedly bridged
his eyes under broad eyebrows ringed round the iris with a line of
vivid hazel and as his lips though mild in expression were scornful
in form so these eyes even in their contemplation seemed fierce
Calm controlled face as it was its meaning for the spectator was of
something passionate and implacable In mother and son alike one felt a
capacity for endurance almost tragic but while Augustines would be the
endurance of the rock to be moved only by shattering his mothers was
the endurance of the flower that bends before the tempest unresisting
beaten down into the earth but lying even there unbroken
II
The noise and movement of an outer world seemed to break in upon the
recorded vision of arrested life
The door opened a quick decisive step approached down the hall and
closely following the announcing maid Mrs Grey the local squiress
entered the room In the normal run of rural conventions Lady Channice
should have held the place but Charlock House no longer stood for what
it had used to stand in the days of Sir Hugh Channices forbears Mrs
Grey of Pangley Hall had never held any but the first place and a
consciousness of this fact seemed to radiate from her competent
personality She was a vast middleaged woman clad in tweed and leather
but her abundance of firm hard flesh could lend itself to the roughest
exigences of a sporting outdoor life Her broad face shone like a ripe
apple and her sharp eyes her tight lips the cheerful creases of her
face expressed an observant and rather tyrannous goodtemper
Tea No thanks no tea for me she almost shouted Ive just had tea
with Mrs Grier How are you Lady Channice and you Augustine What a
man you are getting to be a good inch taller than my Tom Reading as
usual I see I cant get my boys to look at a book in vacation time
Whats the book Ah fuddling your brains with that stuff still are
you Still determined to be a philosopher Do you really want him to be
a philosopher my dear
Indeed I think it would be very nice if he could be a philosopher
said Lady Channice smiling for though she had often to evade Mrs
Greys tyranny she liked her good temper She seemed in her reply to
float lightly and almost gaily above Mrs Grey and away from her Mrs
Grey was accustomed to these tactics and it was characteristic of her
not to let people float away if she could possibly help it This matter
of Augustines future was frequently in dispute between them Her feet
planted firmly her rifle at her shoulder she seemed now to take aim at
a bird that flew from her
And of course you encourage him You read with him and study with him
And you wont see that you let him drift more and more out of practical
life and into moonshine What does it do for him thats what I ask
Where does it lead him Whats the good of it Why hell finish as a
fusty old don Does it make you a better man Augustine or a happier
one to spend all your time reading philosophy
Very much better very much happier I findbut I dont give it all
my time you know Augustine answered with much his mothers manner of
light evasion He let Mrs Grey see that he found her funny perhaps he
wished to let her see that philosophy helped him to Mrs Grey gave up
the fantastic bird and turned on her heel
Well Ive not come to dispute as usual with you Augustine Ive
come to ask you Lady Channice if you wont for once break through
your rules and come to tea on Sunday Ive a surprise for you An old
friend of yours is to be of our party for this weekend Lady Elliston
she comes tomorrow and she writes that she hopes to see something of
you
Mrs Grey had her eye rather sharply on Lady Channice she expected to
see her colour rise and it did rise
Lady Elliston she repeated vaguely or perhaps faintly
Yes you did know her well she told me
It was years ago said Lady Channice looking down Yes I knew her
quite well It would be very nice to see her again But I dont think I
will break my rule thank you so much
Mrs Grey looked a little disconcerted and a little displeased Now
that you are growing up Augustine she said you must shake your
mother out of her way of life Its bad for her She lives here quite
alone and when you are awayas you will have to be more and more for
some time nowshe sees nobody but her village girls Mrs Grier and me
from one months end to the other I cant think what shes made of I
should go mad And so many of us would be delighted if she would drop in
to tea with us now and then
Oh well you can drop in to tea with her instead said Augustine His
mother sat silent with her faint smile
Well I do But Im not enough though I flatter myself that Im a good
deal Its unwholesome such a life downright morbid and unwholesome
One should mingle with ones kind I shall wonder at you Augustine if
you allow it just as for years Ive wondered at your father
It may have been her own slight confusion or it may have been something
exasperating in Lady Channices silence that had precipitated Mrs Grey
upon this speech but when she had made it she became very red and
wondered whether she had gone too far Mrs Grey was prepared to go far
If people evaded her and showed an unwillingness to let her be kind to
themon her own termsterms which in regard to Lady Channice were
very strictly definedif people would behave in this unbecoming and
ungrateful fashion they only got so Mrs Grey would have put it what
they jolly well deserved if she gave them a stinger But Mrs Grey did
not like to give Lady Channice stingers therefore she now became red
and wondered at herself
Lady Channice had lifted her eyes and it was as if Mrs Grey saw walls
and moats and impenetrable thickets glooming in them She answered for
Augustine My husband and I have always been in perfect agreement on
the matter
Mrs Grey tried a cheerful laughYou won him over too no doubt
Entirely
Well Augustine Mrs Grey turned to the young man again I dont
succeed with your mother but I hope for better luck with you Youre a
man now and not yet at all events a monk Wont you dine with us on
Saturday night
Now Mrs Grey was kind but she had never asked Lady Channice to dinner
The line had been drawn firmly drawn years agoand by Mrs Grey
herselfat tea And it was not until Lady Channice had lived for
several years at Charlock House when it became evident that in spite
of all that was suspicious not to say sinister in her situation she
was not exactly cast off and that her husband so to speak admitted her
to tea if not to dinnerit was not until then that Mrs Grey voiced at
once the tolerance and the discretion of the neighbourhood and said
They are on friendly terms he comes to see her twice a year We can
call she need not be asked to anything but tea There can be no harm in
that
There was indeed no harm for though when they did call in Mrs
Greys broad wake they were received with gentle courtesy they were
made to feel that social contacts would go no further Lady Channice had
been either too much offended or too much frightened by the years of
ostracism or perhaps it was really by her own choice that she adopted
the attitude of a person who saw people when they came to her but who
never went to see them This attitude accepted by the few was resented
by the many so that hardly anybody ever called upon Lady Channice And
so it was that Mrs Grey satisfied at once benevolence and curiosity in
her staunch visits to the recluse of Charlock House and could feel
herself as Lady Channices one wholesome link with the world that she
had rejected orhere lay all the ambiguity all the mystery that for
years had whetted Mrs Greys curiosity to feverpointthat had
rejected her
As Augustine grew up the situation became more complicated It was felt
that as the future owner of Charlock House and inheritor of his mothers
fortune Augustine was not to be tentatively taken up but decisively
seized People had resented Sir Hughs indifference to Charlock House
the fact that he had never lived there and had tried just before his
marriage to sell it But Augustine was yet blameless and Augustine
would one day be a wealthy not an impecunious squire and Mrs Grey had
said that she would see to it that Augustine had his chance Apparently
theres no one to bring him out unless I do she said His father it
seems wont and his mother cant One doesnt know what to think or
at all events one keeps what one thinks to oneself for she is a good
sweet creature whatever her faults may have been But Augustine shall
be asked to dinner one day
Augustines chance in Mrs Greys eye was her sixth daughter
Marjory
So now the first step up the ladder was being given to Augustine
He kept his vagueness his lightness his coolly pleasant smile looking
at Mrs Grey and not at his mother as he answered Thanks so much but
Im monastic too you know I dont go to dinners Ill ride over some
afternoon and see you all
Mrs Grey compressed her lips She was hurt and she had also some
difficulty in restraining her temper before this rebuff But you go to
dinners in London You stay with people
Ah yes but Im alone then When Im with my mother I share her life
He spoke so lightly yet so decisively with a tact and firmness beyond
his years that Mrs Grey rose accepting her defeat
Then Lady Elliston and I will come over some day she said I wish
we saw more of her John and I met her while we were staying with the
Bishop this Spring The Bishop has the highest opinion of her He said
that she was a most unusual womanin the world yet not of it One
feels that Her eldest girl married young Lord Catesby you know a very
brilliant match she presents her second girl next Spring when I do
Marjory You must come over for a ride with Marjory soon Augustine
I will very soon said Augustine
When their visitor at last went when the tramp of her heavy boots had
receded down the hall Lady Channice and her son again sat in silence
but it was now another silence from that into which Mrs Greys shots
had broken It was like the stillness of the copse or hedgerow when the
sportsmen are gone and a vague stir and rustle in ditch or underbrush
tells of broken wings or limbs of a wounded thing hiding
Lady Channice spoke at last I wish you had accepted for the dinner
Augustine I dont want you to identify yourself with my peculiarities
I didnt want to dine with Mrs Grey mother
You hurt her She is a kind neighbour You will see her more or less
for all of your life probably You must take your place here
Augustine
My place is taken I like it just as it is Ill see the Greys as I
always have seen them Ill go over to tea now and then and Ill ride
and hunt with the children
But that was when you were a child You are almost a man now you are a
man Augustine and your place isnt a childs place
My place is by you For the second time that day there was a new note
in Augustines voice It was as if clearly and definitely for the
first time he was feeling something and seeing something and as if
though very resolutely keeping from her what he felt he was when
pushed to it as resolutely determined to let her see what he saw
By me dear she said faintly What do you mean
She ought to have asked you to dinner too
But I would not have accepted I dont go out She knows that She
knows that I am a real recluse
She ought to have asked knowing that you would not accept
Augustine dear you are foolish You know nothing of these little
feminine social compacts
Are they only feminine
Only Mere crystallised conveniences It would be absurd for Mrs Grey
after all these years to ask me in order to be refused
There was a moments silence and then Augustine said Did she ever ask
you
The candles had been lighted and the lamp brought in making the corners
of the room look darker There was only a vague radiance about the
chimney piece the little candleflames doubled in the mirror and the
bright circle where Lady Channice and her son sat on either side of the
large round table The lamp had a green shade and their faces were in
shadow Augustine had turned away his eyes
And now a strange and painful thing happened stranger and more painful
than he could have foreseen for his mother did not answer him The
silence grew long and she did not speak Augustine looked at her at last
and saw that she was gazing at him and it seemed to him with helpless
fear His own eyes did not echo it anger rather rose in them cold
fierceness against himself it was apparent as well as against the
world that he suspected He was not impulsive he was not demonstrative
but he got up and put his hand on her shoulder I dont mean to torment
you like the rest of them he said I dont mean to askand be
refused Forget what I said Its onlyonlythat it infuriates meTo
see them allAnd youcut off wasted in prison here Ive been
seeing it for a long time I wont speak of it again I know that there
are sad things in your life All I want to say all I wanted to say
wasthat Im with you and against them
She sat her face in shadow beneath him her hands tightly clasped
together and pressed down upon her lap And in a faltering voice that
strove in vain for firmness she said Dear Augustinethank you I
know you wouldnt want to hurt me You see when I came here to live I
had partedfrom your father and I wanted to be quite alone I wanted
to see no one And they felt that they felt that I wouldnt lead the
usual life So it grew most naturally Dont be angry with people or
with the world That would warp you from the beginning Its a good
world Augustine Ive found it so It is sad but there is such
beautyIm not cut off or wastedIm not in prisonHow can you
say it dear of me who have youand him
Augustines hand rested on her shoulder for some moments more Lifting
it he stood looking before him Im not going to quarrel with the
world he then said I know what I like in it
Dearthanks she murmured
Augustine picked up his book again Ill study for a bit now in my
room he said Will you rest before dinner Do I shall feel more easy
in my conscience if I inflict Hegel on you afterwards
III
Lady Channice did not go and rest She sat on in the shadowy room gazing
before her her hands still clasped her face wearing still its look of
fear For twenty years she had not known what it was to be without fear
It had become as much a part of her life as the air she breathed and any
peace or gladness had blossomed for her only in that air sometimes she
was almost unconscious of it This afternoon she had become conscious
It was as if the air were heavy and oppressive and as if she breathed
with difficulty And sitting there she asked herself if the time was
coming when she must tell Augustine
What she might have to tell was a story that seemed strangely
disproportionate it was the story of her life but all of it that
mattered all of it that made the story was pressed into one year long
ago Before that year was sunny uneventful girlhood after it grey
uneventful womanhood the incident the drama was all knotted into one
year and it seemed to belong to herself no longer she seemed a
spectator looking back in wonder at the disaster of another womans
life A long flat road stretched out behind her she had journeyed over
it for years and on the far horizon she saw if she looked back the
smoke and flames of a burning citymiles and miles away
Amabel Freer was the daughter of a rural Dean a scholarly sceptical
man The forms of religion were his without its heart its heart was her
mothers who was saintly and whose orthodoxy was the vaguest symbolic
system From her father Amabel had the scholars love of beauty in
thought from her mother the love of beauty in life but her loves had
been dreamy she had thought and lived little Happy compliance happy
confidence a dawnlike sense of sweetness and purity had filled her
girlhood
When she was sixteen her father had died and her mother in the
following year Amabel and her brother Bertram were well dowered
Bertram was in the Foreign Office neither saintly nor scholarly like
his parents nor undeveloped like his young sister He was a capable
conventional man of the world sure of himself and rather suspicious of
others Amabel imagined him a model of all that was good and lovely The
sudden bereavement of her youth bewildered and overwhelmed her her
capacity for dependent selfdevoting love sought for an object and
lavished itself upon her brother She went to live with an aunt her
fathers sister and when she was eighteen her aunt brought her to
London a tall heavy and rather clumsy country girl arrested rather
than developed by grief Her aunt was a worldworn harassed woman she
had married off her four daughters with difficulty and felt the need of
a change of occupation but she accepted as a matter of course the duty
of marrying off Amabel That task accomplished she would go to bed every
night at half past ten and devote her days to collecting coins and
enamels Her respite came far more quickly than she could have imagined
possible Amabel had promise of great beauty but two or three years
were needed to fulfill it Mrs Compton could but be surprised when Sir
Hugh Channice an older colleague of Bertrams a fashionable and
charming man asked for the hand of her unformed young charge Sir Hugh
was fourteen years Amabels senior and her very guilelessness no doubt
attracted him then there was the money he was not well off and he
lived a life rather hazardously full Still Mrs Compton could hardly
believe in her goodfortune Amabel accepted her own very simply her
compliance and confidence were even deeper than before Sir Hugh was the
most graceful of lovers His quizzical tenderness reminded her of her
father his quasipaternal courtship emphasized her instinctive trust in
the beauty and goodness of life
So at eighteen she was married at St Georges Hanover Square and wore a
wonderful long satin train and her mothers lace veil and her mothers
pearls around her neck and hair A bridesmaid had said that pearls were
unlucky but Mrs Compton tersely answeredNot if they are such good
ones as these Amabel had bowed her head to the pearls seeing them
with the train and the veil and her own snowy figure vaguely still
in the dreamlike haze Memories of her father and mother and of the
dear deanery among its meadows floating fragments of the poetry her
father had loved of the prayers her mother had taught her in childhood
hovered in her mind She seemed to see the primrose woods where she had
wandered and to hear the sound of brooks and birds in Spring A vague
smile was on her lips She thought of Sir Hugh as of a radiance lighting
all She was the happiest of girls
Shortly after her marriage all the radiance all the haze was gone It
had been difficult then to know why Now as she looked back she
thought that she could understand
She had been curiously young curiously inexperienced She had expected
life to go on as dawn for ever Everyday light had filled her with
bleakness and disillusion She had had childish fancies that her
husband did not really love her that she counted for nothing in his
life Yet Sir Hugh had never changed except that he very seldom made
love to her and that she saw less of him than during their engagement
Sir Hugh was still quizzically tender still all grace all deference
when he was there And what wonder that he was little there he had a
wide life he was a brilliant man she was a stupid young girl in
looking back no longer young no longer stupid Lady Channice thought
that she could see it all quite clearly She had seemed to him a sweet
