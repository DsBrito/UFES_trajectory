It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had
interested me deeply in crime and that after his disappearance I never
failed to read with care the various problems which came before the
public And I even attempted more than once for my own private
satisfaction to employ his methods in their solution though with
indifferent success There was none however which appealed to me like
this tragedy of Ronald Adair As I read the evidence at the inquest
which led up to a verdict of willful murder against some person or
persons unknown I realized more clearly than I had ever done the loss
which the community had sustained by the death of Sherlock Holmes There
were points about this strange business which would I was sure have
specially appealed to him and the efforts of the police would have been
supplemented or more probably anticipated by the trained observation
and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe All day as
I drove upon my round I turned over the case in my mind and found no
explanation which appeared to me to be adequate At the risk of telling
a twicetold tale I will recapitulate the facts as they were known to
the public at the conclusion of the inquest
The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth
at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies Adairs mother
had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for cataract and
she her son Ronald and her daughter Hilda were living together at
427 Park Lane The youth moved in the best societyhad so far as was
known no enemies and no particular vices He had been engaged to Miss
Edith Woodley of Carstairs but the engagement had been broken off by
mutual consent some months before and there was no sign that it had
left any very profound feeling behind it For the rest sic the mans
life moved in a narrow and conventional circle for his habits were
quiet and his nature unemotional Yet it was upon this easygoing young
aristocrat that death came in most strange and unexpected form between
the hours of ten and eleventwenty on the night of March 30 1894
Ronald Adair was fond of cardsplaying continually but never for such
stakes as would hurt him He was a member of the Baldwin the Cavendish
and the Bagatelle card clubs It was shown that after dinner on the day
of his death he had played a rubber of whist at the latter club He had
also played there in the afternoon The evidence of those who had played
with himMr Murray Sir John Hardy and Colonel Moranshowed that
the game was whist and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards
Adair might have lost five pounds but not more His fortune was a
considerable one and such a loss could not in any way affect him He
had played nearly every day at one club or other but he was a cautious
player and usually rose a winner It came out in evidence that in
partnership with Colonel Moran he had actually won as much as four
hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some weeks before from Godfrey
Milner and Lord Balmoral So much for his recent history as it came out
at the inquest
On the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at ten
His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation The
servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second
floor generally used as his sittingroom She had lit a fire there and
as it smoked she had opened the window No sound was heard from the room
until eleventwenty the hour of the return of Lady Maynooth and her
daughter Desiring to say goodnight she attempted to enter her sons
room The door was locked on the inside and no answer could be got to
their cries and knocking Help was obtained and the door forced The
unfortunate young man was found lying near the table His head had been
horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet but no weapon of any
sort was to be found in the room On the table lay two banknotes for
ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in silver and gold the money
arranged in little piles of varying amount There were some figures also
upon a sheet of paper with the names of some club friends opposite
to them from which it was conjectured that before his death he was
endeavouring to make out his losses or winnings at cards
A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case
more complex In the first place no reason could be given why the
young man should have fastened the door upon the inside There was the
possibility that the murderer had done this and had afterwards escaped
by the window The drop was at least twenty feet however and a bed of
crocuses in full bloom lay beneath Neither the flowers nor the earth
showed any sign of having been disturbed nor were there any marks
upon the narrow strip of grass which separated the house from the road
Apparently therefore it was the young man himself who had fastened the
door But how did he come by his death No one could have climbed up to
the window without leaving traces Suppose a man had fired through the
window he would indeed be a remarkable shot who could with a
revolver inflict so deadly a wound Again Park Lane is a frequented
thoroughfare there is a cab stand within a hundred yards of the house
No one had heard a shot And yet there was the dead man and there the
revolver bullet which had mushroomed out as softnosed bullets will
and so inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death
Such were the circumstances of the Park Lane Mystery which were further
complicated by entire absence of motive since as I have said young
Adair was not known to have any enemy and no attempt had been made to
remove the money or valuables in the room
All day I turned these facts over in my mind endeavouring to hit upon
some theory which could reconcile them all and to find that line
of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be the
startingpoint of every investigation I confess that I made little
progress In the evening I strolled across the Park and found myself
about six oclock at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane A group of
loafers upon the pavements all staring up at a particular window
directed me to the house which I had come to see A tall thin man with
coloured glasses whom I strongly suspected of being a plainclothes
detective was pointing out some theory of his own while the others
crowded round to listen to what he said I got as near him as I could
but his observations seemed to me to be absurd so I withdrew again in
some disgust As I did so I struck against an elderly deformed man
who had been behind me and I knocked down several books which he was
carrying I remember that as I picked them up I observed the title
of one of them THE ORIGIN OF TREE WORSHIP and it struck me that the
fellow must be some poor bibliophile who either as a trade or as a
hobby was a collector of obscure volumes I endeavoured to apologize
for the accident but it was evident that these books which I had so
unfortunately maltreated were very precious objects in the eyes of their
owner With a snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel and I saw his
curved back and white sidewhiskers disappear among the throng
My observations of No 427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem
in which I was interested The house was separated from the street by
a low wall and railing the whole not more than five feet high It was
perfectly easy therefore for anyone to get into the garden but
the window was entirely inaccessible since there was no waterpipe or
anything which could help the most active man to climb it More puzzled
than ever I retraced my steps to Kensington I had not been in my study
five minutes when the maid entered to say that a person desired to
see me To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book
collector his sharp wizened face peering out from a frame of white
hair and his precious volumes a dozen of them at least wedged under
his right arm
Youre surprised to see me sir said he in a strange croaking
voice
I acknowledged that I was
Well Ive a conscience sir and when I chanced to see you go into
this house as I came hobbling after you I thought to myself Ill just
step in and see that kind gentleman and tell him that if I was a bit
gruff in my manner there was not any harm meant and that I am much
obliged to him for picking up my books
You make too much of a trifle said I May I ask how you knew who I
was
Well sir if it isnt too great a liberty I am a neighbour of yours
for youll find my little bookshop at the corner of Church Street
and very happy to see you I am sure Maybe you collect yourself sir
Heres BRITISH BIRDS and CATULLUS and THE HOLY WARa bargain every
one of them With five volumes you could just fill that gap on that
second shelf It looks untidy does it not sir
I moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me When I turned again
Sherlock Holmes was standing smiling at me across my study table I rose
to my feet stared at him for some seconds in utter amazement and then
it appears that I must have fainted for the first and the last time
in my life Certainly a gray mist swirled before my eyes and when it
cleared I found my collarends undone and the tingling aftertaste of
brandy upon my lips Holmes was bending over my chair his flask in his
hand
My dear Watson said the wellremembered voice I owe you a thousand
apologies I had no idea that you would be so affected
I gripped him by the arms
Holmes I cried Is it really you Can it indeed be that you are
alive Is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of that awful
abyss
Wait a moment said he Are you sure that you are really fit to
discuss things I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily
dramatic reappearance
I am all right but indeed Holmes I can hardly believe my eyes Good
heavens to think that youyou of all menshould be standing in my
study Again I gripped him by the sleeve and felt the thin sinewy arm
beneath it Well youre not a spirit anyhow said I My dear chap
Im overjoyed to see you Sit down and tell me how you came alive out
of that dreadful chasm
He sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant
manner He was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book merchant but
the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white hair and old books
upon the table Holmes looked even thinner and keener than of old but
there was a deadwhite tinge in his aquiline face which told me that his
life recently had not been a healthy one
I am glad to stretch myself Watson said he It is no joke when a
tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several hours on end
Now my dear fellow in the matter of these explanations we have if I
may ask for your cooperation a hard and dangerous nights work in front
of us Perhaps it would be better if I gave you an account of the whole
situation when that work is finished
I am full of curiosity I should much prefer to hear now
Youll come with me tonight
When you like and where you like
This is indeed like the old days We shall have time for a mouthful
of dinner before we need go Well then about that chasm I had no
serious difficulty in getting out of it for the very simple reason that
I never was in it
You never were in it
No Watson I never was in it My note to you was absolutely genuine
I had little doubt that I had come to the end of my career when I
perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late Professor Moriarty
standing upon the narrow pathway which led to safety I read an
inexorable purpose in his gray eyes I exchanged some remarks with him
therefore and obtained his courteous permission to write the short note
which you afterwards received I left it with my cigarettebox and my
stick and I walked along the pathway Moriarty still at my heels When
I reached the end I stood at bay He drew no weapon but he rushed at me
and threw his long arms around me He knew that his own game was up and
was only anxious to revenge himself upon me We tottered together upon
the brink of the fall I have some knowledge however of baritsu or
the Japanese system of wrestling which has more than once been very
useful to me I slipped through his grip and he with a horrible scream
kicked madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands
But for all his efforts he could not get his balance and over he went
With my face over the brink I saw him fall for a long way Then he
struck a rock bounded off and splashed into the water
I listened with amazement to this explanation which Holmes delivered
between the puffs of his cigarette
But the tracks I cried I saw with my own eyes that two went down
the path and none returned
It came about in this way The instant that the Professor had
disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky chance
Fate had placed in my way I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who
had sworn my death There were at least three others whose desire for
vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader
They were all most dangerous men One or other would certainly get me
On the other hand if all the world was convinced that I was dead they
would take liberties these men they would soon lay themselves open
and sooner or later I could destroy them Then it would be time for me
to announce that I was still in the land of the living So rapidly does
the brain act that I believe I had thought this all out before Professor
Moriarty had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall
I stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me In your picturesque
account of the matter which I read with great interest some months
later you assert that the wall was sheer That was not literally
true A few small footholds presented themselves and there was some
indication of a ledge The cliff is so high that to climb it all was
an obvious impossibility and it was equally impossible to make my way
along the wet path without leaving some tracks I might it is true
have reversed my boots as I have done on similar occasions but the
sight of three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have
suggested a deception On the whole then it was best that I should
risk the climb It was not a pleasant business Watson The fall roared
beneath me I am not a fanciful person but I give you my word that
I seemed to hear Moriartys voice screaming at me out of the abyss A
mistake would have been fatal More than once as tufts of grass came
out in my hand or my foot slipped in the wet notches of the rock I
thought that I was gone But I struggled upward and at last I reached a
ledge several feet deep and covered with soft green moss where I could
lie unseen in the most perfect comfort There I was stretched when
you my dear Watson and all your following were investigating in the
most sympathetic and inefficient manner the circumstances of my death
At last when you had all formed your inevitable and totally erroneous
conclusions you departed for the hotel and I was left alone I
had imagined that I had reached the end of my adventures but a very
unexpected occurrence showed me that there were surprises still in store
for me A huge rock falling from above boomed past me struck the
path and bounded over into the chasm For an instant I thought that
it was an accident but a moment later looking up I saw a mans head
against the darkening sky and another stone struck the very ledge upon
which I was stretched within a foot of my head Of course the meaning
of this was obvious Moriarty had not been alone A confederateand
even that one glance had told me how dangerous a man that confederate
washad kept guard while the Professor had attacked me From a
distance unseen by me he had been a witness of his friends death and
of my escape He had waited and then making his way round to the top of
the cliff he had endeavoured to succeed where his comrade had failed
I did not take long to think about it Watson Again I saw that grim
face look over the cliff and I knew that it was the precursor of
another stone I scrambled down on to the path I dont think I could
have done it in cold blood It was a hundred times more difficult than
getting up But I had no time to think of the danger for another stone
sang past me as I hung by my hands from the edge of the ledge Halfway
down I slipped but by the blessing of God I landed torn and
bleeding upon the path I took to my heels did ten miles over the
mountains in the darkness and a week later I found myself in Florence
with the certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me
I had only one confidantmy brother Mycroft I owe you many apologies
my dear Watson but it was allimportant that it should be thought I
was dead and it is quite certain that you would not have written so
convincing an account of my unhappy end had you not yourself thought
that it was true Several times during the last three years I have taken
up my pen to write to you but always I feared lest your affectionate
regard for me should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray
my secret For that reason I turned away from you this evening when
you upset my books for I was in danger at the time and any show of
surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention to my
identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable results As to
Mycroft I had to confide in him in order to obtain the money which
I needed The course of events in London did not run so well as I had
hoped for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous
members my own most vindictive enemies at liberty I travelled for
two years in Tibet therefore and amused myself by visiting Lhassa
and spending some days with the head lama You may have read of the
remarkable explorations of a Norwegian named Sigerson but I am sure
that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news of your
friend I then passed through Persia looked in at Mecca and paid a
short but interesting visit to the Khalifa at Khartoum the results of
which I have communicated to the Foreign Office Returning to France I
spent some months in a research into the coaltar derivatives which I
conducted in a laboratory at Montpellier in the south of France Having
concluded this to my satisfaction and learning that only one of my
enemies was now left in London I was about to return when my movements
were hastened by the news of this very remarkable Park Lane Mystery
which not only appealed to me by its own merits but which seemed to
offer some most peculiar personal opportunities I came over at once to
London called in my own person at Baker Street threw Mrs Hudson into
violent hysterics and found that Mycroft had preserved my rooms and my
papers exactly as they had always been So it was my dear Watson that
at two oclock today I found myself in my old armchair in my own old
room and only wishing that I could have seen my old friend Watson in
the other chair which he has so often adorned
Such was the remarkable narrative to which I listened on that April
eveninga narrative which would have been utterly incredible to me had
it not been confirmed by the actual sight of the tall spare figure and
the keen eager face which I had never thought to see again In some
manner he had learned of my own sad bereavement and his sympathy was
shown in his manner rather than in his words Work is the best antidote
to sorrow my dear Watson said he and I have a piece of work for us
both tonight which if we can bring it to a successful conclusion will
in itself justify a mans life on this planet In vain I begged him
to tell me more You will hear and see enough before morning he
answered We have three years of the past to discuss Let that suffice
until halfpast nine when we start upon the notable adventure of the
empty house
It was indeed like old times when at that hour I found myself seated
beside him in a hansom my revolver in my pocket and the thrill of
adventure in my heart Holmes was cold and stern and silent As the
gleam of the streetlamps flashed upon his austere features I saw that
his brows were drawn down in thought and his thin lips compressed I
knew not what wild beast we were about to hunt down in the dark jungle
of criminal London but I was well assured from the bearing of this
master huntsman that the adventure was a most grave onewhile the
sardonic smile which occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded
little good for the object of our quest
I had imagined that we were bound for Baker Street but Holmes stopped
the cab at the corner of Cavendish Square I observed that as he stepped
out he gave a most searching glance to right and left and at every
subsequent street corner he took the utmost pains to assure that he was
not followed Our route was certainly a singular one Holmess knowledge
of the byways of London was extraordinary and on this occasion he
passed rapidly and with an assured step through a network of mews and
stables the very existence of which I had never known We emerged at
last into a small road lined with old gloomy houses which led us into
Manchester Street and so to Blandford Street Here he turned swiftly
down a narrow passage passed through a wooden gate into a deserted
yard and then opened with a key the back door of a house We entered
together and he closed it behind us
The place was pitch dark but it was evident to me that it was an empty
house Our feet creaked and crackled over the bare planking and my
outstretched hand touched a wall from which the paper was hanging in
ribbons Holmess cold thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me
forward down a long hall until I dimly saw the murky fanlight over the
door Here Holmes turned suddenly to the right and we found ourselves
in a large square empty room heavily shadowed in the corners but
faintly lit in the centre from the lights of the street beyond There
was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust so that we could
only just discern each others figures within My companion put his hand
upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear
Do you know where we are he whispered
Surely that is Baker Street I answered staring through the dim
window
Exactly We are in Camden House which stands opposite to our own old
quarters
But why are we here
Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile Might
I trouble you my dear Watson to draw a little nearer to the window
taking every precaution not to show yourself and then to look up at our
old roomsthe startingpoint of so many of your little fairytales We
will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power
to surprise you
I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window As my eyes
fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement The blind was down
and a strong light was burning in the room The shadow of a man who
was seated in a chair within was thrown in hard black outline upon the
luminous screen of the window There was no mistaking the poise of the
head the squareness of the shoulders the sharpness of the features
The face was turned halfround and the effect was that of one of
those black silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame It was a
perfect reproduction of Holmes So amazed was I that I threw out my
hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me He was
quivering with silent laughter
Well said he
Good heavens I cried It is marvellous
I trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite variety
said he and I recognized in his voice the joy and pride which the
artist takes in his own creation It really is rather like me is it
not
I should be prepared to swear that it was you
The credit of the execution is due to Monsieur Oscar Meunier of
Grenoble who spent some days in doing the moulding It is a bust in
wax The rest I arranged myself during my visit to Baker Street this
afternoon
But why
Because my dear Watson I had the strongest possible reason for
wishing certain people to think that I was there when I was really
elsewhere
And you thought the rooms were watched
I KNEW that they were watched
By whom
By my old enemies Watson By the charming society whose leader lies
in the Reichenbach Fall You must remember that they knew and only
they knew that I was still alive Sooner or later they believed that I
should come back to my rooms They watched them continuously and this
morning they saw me arrive
How do you know
Because I recognized their sentinel when I glanced out of my window He
is a harmless enough fellow Parker by name a garroter by trade and a
remarkable performer upon the jewsharp I cared nothing for him But
I cared a great deal for the much more formidable person who was behind
him the bosom friend of Moriarty the man who dropped the rocks over
the cliff the most cunning and dangerous criminal in London That is
the man who is after me tonight Watson and that is the man who is
quite unaware that we are after him
My friends plans were gradually revealing themselves From this
convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the trackers
tracked That angular shadow up yonder was the bait and we were the
hunters In silence we stood together in the darkness and watched the
hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front of us Holmes was
silent and motionless but I could tell that he was keenly alert and
that his eyes were fixed intently upon the stream of passersby It was
a bleak and boisterous night and the wind whistled shrilly down the
long street Many people were moving to and fro most of them muffled in
their coats and cravats Once or twice it seemed to me that I had seen
the same figure before and I especially noticed two men who appeared
to be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house
some distance up the street I tried to draw my companions attention to
them but he gave a little ejaculation of impatience and continued
to stare into the street More than once he fidgeted with his feet and
tapped rapidly with his fingers upon the wall It was evident to me
that he was becoming uneasy and that his plans were not working out
altogether as he had hoped At last as midnight approached and
the street gradually cleared he paced up and down the room in
uncontrollable agitation I was about to make some remark to him when
I raised my eyes to the lighted window and again experienced almost as
great a surprise as before I clutched Holmess arm and pointed upward
The shadow has moved I cried
It was indeed no longer the profile but the back which was turned
towards us
Three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his temper or
his impatience with a less active intelligence than his own
Of course it has moved said he Am I such a farcical bungler
Watson that I should erect an obvious dummy and expect that some of
the sharpest men in Europe would be deceived by it We have been in
this room two hours and Mrs Hudson has made some change in that figure
eight times or once in every quarter of an hour She works it from the
front so that her shadow may never be seen Ah He drew in his breath
with a shrill excited intake In the dim light I saw his head thrown
forward his whole attitude rigid with attention Outside the street
was absolutely deserted Those two men might still be crouching in the
doorway but I could no longer see them All was still and dark save
only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure
outlined upon its centre Again in the utter silence I heard that thin
sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement An instant
later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room and I
felt his warning hand upon my lips The fingers which clutched me were
quivering Never had I known my friend more moved and yet the dark
street still stretched lonely and motionless before us
But suddenly I was aware of that which his keener senses had already
distinguished A low stealthy sound came to my ears not from the
direction of Baker Street but from the back of the very house in which
we lay concealed A door opened and shut An instant later steps
crept down the passagesteps which were meant to be silent but which
reverberated harshly through the empty house Holmes crouched back
against the wall and I did the same my hand closing upon the handle
of my revolver Peering through the gloom I saw the vague outline of a
man a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door He stood for
an instant and then he crept forward crouching menacing into the
room He was within three yards of us this sinister figure and I had
braced myself to meet his spring before I realized that he had no idea
of our presence He passed close beside us stole over to the window
and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a foot As he sank to
the level of this opening the light of the street no longer dimmed by
the dusty glass fell full upon his face The man seemed to be beside
himself with excitement His two eyes shone like stars and his
features were working convulsively He was an elderly man with a thin
projecting nose a high bald forehead and a huge grizzled moustache
An opera hat was pushed to the back of his head and an evening dress
shirtfront gleamed out through his open overcoat His face was gaunt
and swarthy scored with deep savage lines In his hand he carried what
appeared to be a stick but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave
a metallic clang Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky
object and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud
sharp click as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place Still
kneeling upon the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and
strength upon some lever with the result that there came a long
whirling grinding noise ending once more in a powerful click He
straightened himself then and I saw that what he held in his hand was
a sort of gun with a curiously misshapen butt He opened it at the
breech put something in and snapped the breechlock Then crouching
down he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window
and I saw his long moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as
it peered along the sights I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as
he cuddled the butt into his shoulder and saw that amazing target
the black man on the yellow ground standing clear at the end of his
foresight For an instant he was rigid and motionless Then his finger
tightened on the trigger There was a strange loud whiz and a long
silvery tinkle of broken glass At that instant Holmes sprang like a
tiger on to the marksmans back and hurled him flat upon his face He
was up again in a moment and with convulsive strength he seized
Holmes by the throat but I struck him on the head with the butt of my
revolver and he dropped again upon the floor I fell upon him and as
I held him my comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle There was the
clatter of running feet upon the pavement and two policemen in uniform
with one plainclothes detective rushed through the front entrance and
into the room
That you Lestrade said Holmes
Yes Mr Holmes I took the job myself Its good to see you back in
London sir
I think you want a little unofficial help Three undetected murders in
one year wont do Lestrade But you handled the Molesey Mystery with
less than your usualthats to say you handled it fairly well
We had all risen to our feet our prisoner breathing hard with a
stalwart constable on each side of him Already a few loiterers had
begun to collect in the street Holmes stepped up to the window closed
it and dropped the blinds Lestrade had produced two candles and the
policemen had uncovered their lanterns I was able at last to have a
good look at our prisoner
It was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was turned
towards us With the brow of a philosopher above and the jaw of a
sensualist below the man must have started with great capacities for
