Release from the crowded womb brought no immediate awakening from the
long sleep of gestation for a sense of identity comes only slowly to
the very young the newborn He did not realize that his intellectual
awakening gradual as it seemed to him was really extraordinarily
rapid a matter of only two or three weeks after birth To him with no
frame of reference it was a time of mystery that was not recognized as
mystery At first there was only Warmth and Hunger for which he had no
names but which he recognized by their presence or absence There was
the satisfying of Hunger Sleep and the return of Hunger Had he been
inclined to philosophy at that tender age he would have considered the
cycle a complete and satisfying one In a few days however there were
longer periods between the satisfying of Hunger and the coming of
Sleepa sort of comfortable fullstomached reverie that was the
beginning of the end
With astounding precocity of which he was completely unaware he began
rapidly sorting and cataloguing noises that had previously conveyed no
meaning He now learned to associate certain sounds with certain sources
and place others under tentative listings while awaiting further data
Smells received the same treatment as noises and often the two could be
related A certain smell and a certain gobbling sort of noise were often
followed by a frightening swoop as he was lifted but his eyes were not
yet focused and could give him little information as to the manner or
purpose of lifting
In his fourth week of life he began to be troubled His little handful
of memories centered around a growing and not entirely subjective
awareness of himself as an individual Clearly life could be divided
into me and not me To have arrived at that conclusion twentyodd
days after birth was an incredible achievement His mind was quick
but it could not reason further without a basis for logic a system
of reference learned data from which further data could be inferred
There was uneasiness in him but no warning of danger only a stirring
of memory that tried to rise to the conscious level Wonderingly he
prodded the memory a little as an inquisitive child pokes at a
slowburning firecracker or a wary pup approaches its first cat Like
the sharp crack of a squib the quick spit of a cat the memory erupted
and flung him back on his mental heels
He felt a sensation that he knew was death though he had no name for
it and his immature defenses sprang into action tried in vain to block
the memory to thrust Death back into its Pandoras Box He impeded the
flood by an infinitesimal fraction of a second and then full awareness
came and with it an understanding of the terrible thing that had
happened the thing that heyes he had done
The fledgling identity of me and not me sank forever into
submergence never to rise again
III
When he was almost four Timmy spoke his first words He said clearly
and matteroffactly I want that one Helen
His mothers mouth slowly opened while her face turned gray with shock
The buckling of her knees in cataplexy forced her to sit down heavily
on a kitchen chair not cushioned for such descents but she was hardly
aware of it Timmy seated on the kitchen floor and surrounded by
halfgrown pups owned by a neighbor screwed his head around to glance
at her impatiently over his shoulder
I want that one he repeated confidently and pointed to the most
illproportioned of an illconceived litter of mongrels Helen raised
shaking hands to her face and screamed
The quick scrape of a chair in the living room and the sound of hasty
footsteps glissading on the throwrug in the hall heralded the approach
of Timmys father The doorway filled with flexing muscles that flexed
in vain but somewhat at a disadvantage by the strictly static tableaux
Helen sat at the table her staring eyes fixed on the child who looked
back in blank astonishment Even the pups were motionless having
cowered in alarm at Helens scream
Whats the matter Timmys father asked
His voice was a spur rudely galvanizing her into action into an awkward
convulsion that landed her on her knees beside Timmy She gripped his
little shoulders with fierce intensity and almost glared into his eyes
Say it again Timmysay it again She looked around wildly
He spoke Jerry as clear as anyone He said I want that one and
pointed Timmy  darling  angel  say it again
Timmys face twitched uncertainly giving the effect of a confused play
of expressions For a moment he looked as though he would cry but then
the crumpled puckered lines magically smoothed The eyes dull and
blank stayed dry He made a senseless noise and slobbered in doing so
His jaw was slack his chin wet
Jerry felt slightly sick
Get up Helen He lifted her somewhat roughly to her feet overrode
her babble Youre frightening the  the child
He talked Jerry  you heard him Didnt you hear him
Come in the living room and sit down She was halfcarried her
protests ignored There was a certain grim determination in his actions
as he made her comfortable Now were going to face it Helen It cant
be put off Timmy was heartwrenching enough by himself but Ive had to
watch the change in you in the past few months Youre getting  well
well call it hysterical I could cut off my arm for saying this honey
but if we keep Timmy any longer youll just have a breakdown thats
all
She moaned softly rocking back and forth in miserys timeless attitude
I cant help it Jerry I  just  cant  help it
I know I know So Im making the decision for both of us here and
now and on my head be it Timmy will have to be put away this week
permanently
No Her wail was more of anguish than of protest
Yes I cant stand coming home from work day after day to find youve
manufactured some new evidence to delude yourself theres hope for him
One day he took the spoon in his hand to feed himself another day he
focused his eyes and looked around the room as though he was really
taking everything in
You said you believed me
So I didat first So Id sit around all evening watching him
willing him to do something intelligent And did he No Hon I dont
want to be unkind to you or to him but I cant stand seeing you delude
yourself making yourself sick Weve both taken more than is good for
us Were at the end of our rope Weve got to face it now and do what
should have been done long ago Its not as if Timmy will miss us He
doesnt even know us after four years
She gathered her forces shut her eyes tight as if to deny his
existence Its no use Jerry I wont do it I am not deluding
myself I heard him speak If that was illusion it was so real to me
that you may as well put us both away together
Hysterical hallucinations
Jerry dont say that again I heard him say I want that one
Helen
You see Already youre embroidering what you heard Now hes
calling his mother by her first name Honest Helen cant you see how
ridiculous youre being If youd thought he said dada or googoo
I could have gone along with the gag but to have him jump the whole
learning stage and come out with a complete concise explicit little
sentence ending familiarly with your Christian name
I dont know how he did it but he did it
Jerry rose from his seat beside her his lips tight I cant honestly
say I love my own child hard as Ive tried But I can say that I love
his mother If I have to bankrupt myself to give Timmy proper care in
an institution then Ill do just that and do it gladly But I wont
falsely place his interests above yours He was born an idiot and he
will live and die an idiot Nothing can change that Timmy goes and
thats final
He clamped his mouth shut and turned toward the kitchen where he knew
his son sat a stupid lump that couldnt even crawl of its own volition
The stupid lump stood firmly in the doorway an uncertain placating
smile on its lips a pup cradled in the slender arms
Jerry I want this one
IV
By Timmys sixth birthday only his parents adamant attitude had
saved him from becoming a side show Once the initial household uproar
had died down and some degree of general sanity been restored Helen
and Jerry had another bad fright They had grudgingly allowed Clancey
the family sawbones to call in a psychologist friend Philip Warwick
The combined efforts of these two to find an explanation for Timmy
resulted in complete chaos with Timmy suffering violent and erratic
lapses into complete idiocy for varying lengths of time Standard tests
meant nothing unless mutually exclusive results could be accepted as
meaningful in themselves At length Timmy suffered a relapse of such
duration that the parents became panicstricken and quietly rebelled
It was obvious that he needed an atmosphere of peace and quiet
Confusion excitement or the concentrated attention of several adults
simply threw him into a relapse
The break came when Clancey called at the house and found it empty
deserted He traced them to a new neighborhood where they had rented a
house with a peaceful walled garden They were not pleased to see him
but Clancey was a psychologist of sorts himself and a working agreement
was arrived at whereby he and Warwick could drop in frequently as
friends and quietly observe Timmy chatting with him when they could
win his confidence and submitting him to whatever tests they could
adequately disguise But under pain of permanent excommunication from
the Douglas menage they were not to discuss him with outsiders in such
a way as to either identify him or draw attention to him Timmy was to
be allowed to set his own pace under their obliquelywatching eyes
He was not to become a subject for newspaper comment for the speculation
of strangers or for the heated discussion of learned gentlemen calling
each other liars in six syllables For Timmy was something new under
the sun
Two years of observation gave Clancey and Warwick an impressive file of
notes on him and they were prone to sit after office hours with it on
the desk between them giving it morose glances They were not happy
Sometimes as now they concluded an evening visit by sitting in
Clanceys or Warwicks car parked outside the Douglas fence holding an
impromptu postmortem on an intellectual corpse that had come to life
in complete defiance of all the rules They didnt notice the stealthy
movement of one of the fenceboards nor the small form that snaked
through the shadows of concealing shrubbery until it was near the open
window of the car
Take wordassociation Clancey I had a few minutes with him this
evening before you got here so I started him on a game where we took
turns in saying a word and trying to guess what the other would reply
I believe he thought I was rather a simpleton and needed humoring
Anyway I tried him with home and got a delayed response Its
happened before Apparently the concept of home is tied to some deeper
disturbance There was a slight uneasy movement from the listening
figure Well linking home and family on my next turn I shot mother
at him There was an immediate flash of confusion in his eyes and again
a delayed response before he blurted Mom Something else had been on
the tip of his tongue but he choked it back and selected what seemed
to him a more suitable reply
Now we both know from two years systematic observation that Helen is
as wellbalanced a mother as youre likely to find Im quite sure she
has no unsuspected bad habits or traits that are leaving sensitive spots
in Timmys mind making him flinch at the association nor is there some
longstanding or unresolved conflict in their relations Yet home and
mother both invoke blocks that inhibit response until consciously
overcome or invoke images that he wishes to conceal lest they betray a
secret I doubt very much whether anything that happened in his first
four years could have left a deep impression on the completely imbecilic
mind he is assumed to have had then That leaves the past two years
Confirmation Gamenot game Should data have predicted
test Indecision Possibly  review later So much to learn
confusion inevitable Next time respond motherthree
laughter Invalid frame of referenceimpossible work
withdiscard
Something else interests me there Phil You suggest he selected
deliberately what seemed an appropriate response to mother Did you
take the next logical step and try father
Yes
And did he anticipate it
Im sure he did I see what you mean  fairly sharp reasoning for a
sixyearold supposed to be mentally retarded When I shot father at
him he came back promptly with maleDouglas almost like one word
Got the sex and identity right Whats wrong with that
Theres nothing wrong or right about it I was hoping for some clue
as to how his mind works Maybe I got it but I dont know what to do
with it I didnt expect a calmly objective cataloguing of the old man
as a maleDouglas
Surprise Where is error Semantics Sociology Colloquial
nuance Decision Reject further wordgames
If thats a clue Phil you can have it Clancey hauled a notebook
from his pocket and held it up Open this thing anywhereanywhere at
all Itll open at an unanswered question At the age of roughly three
and onehalf a congenital idiot suddenly displays flashes of alert
intelligence For fortytwo months that child was content to sit on his
fanny and vegetate Never crawled never spoke never played seldom
even focused his eyes Then one day his mother sees him study some
alphabet blocks with every appearance of curiosity Awareness For the
first time
Later he suddenly reaches out his hand and piles the blocks in
a neat stack Purposeful activity and perfect muscular control No
trialanderror no baby hesitation with hand poisedjust a sudden
assured controlled action Mama leaps for joy junior relapses into
idiocy and no oneincluding mereally believes mama when she says it
happened This sort of thing goes on for several monthsbrief erratic
flashes of extraordinary intelligence considering the subject Then a
child who has never spoken a single word says clearly and politely
I want that one Helen and a child who has never crawled puts his
feet under him and stands up steady as a rock You tell me Philhow
did he do it
Dont look to me for an answer Im only a lousy fifthrate psychology
teacher as of the day you brought Timmy into my life And the curse of
Freud be on you for that kindly act of professional assassination The
answer is obvious of course  Timmy didnt and couldnt do what weve
seen him do with our own wideopen innocent eyes We are the victims of
a cunning hoax
Amusement Difficult to experiment unobserved Action too
precipitateno choice Affectionlaughter The world is so
people Chill Danger Madness
How does any child learn to speak
Illustration
Mainly by hearing others Maybe Timmy learned the same way Maybe he
listened absorbing the meaning and sound of words trying them out
in the silence of his otherwise vacant little noggin Maybe his mind
awakened gradually to the realization that it was a prisoner in a
paralyzed organ straitjacketed by blocks or short circuits Maybe he
spent his fortytwo months of vegetating driving against those blocks
until he partially broke them down and could speak Maybe
And without ever having shaped his lips or tongue to intelligent
sounds he speaks fluently at the first try
Why not Any kid that will start out by addressing its parents chummily
as Helen and Jerry and act naively surprised at the reaction
obviously has rules of its own
They ruminated in silence for a moment
Its too easy to talk vaguely about blocks and short circuits Clancey
How do you account for his completely erratic progress Totally
unpredictable with alternating periods of complete idiocy and high
intelligence
Not totally unpredictable
Oh
At least three things suggest a pattern One is that his relapses
though erratic are becoming ever shorter in duration and more widely
separated
Yes they are infrequent now and quickly ended
The second is that his grasp of the social pattern in which he
liveshis environment in all its subtletiesis constantly improving
Right again At the age of six he can in many ways match a bright lad
twice his age Not in the subtleties thoughI disagree there You can
give him a simple or even a notsosimple explanation of something he
hears on the radio dealing with it as a general theme in sociology
and he seems to grasp the broad outline with little difficulty but in
trivial matters of social behavior and human relations hes frequently
uncertain as likely as not to pull a howling bloomer Seems unusually
baffled and exasperated by some of the social mores he runs into such
as the many tabu subjects for conversation or taking your clothes off
whenever or wherever you feel inclined to Poor Helen She tries to
explain and he keeps doggedly after her with ruthless logic obviously
trying hard to understand and  you know  its surprising how few
really sound logical reasons there are for half the accepted
conventions that rule our lives
Hes pinned me down several times to the conclusion that a certain
convention exists solely because people cant be trusted to behave
rationally without restraining rules Its rather a dismaying conclusion
when its dragged out in the open like that and it seems to horrify
him An ordinary kid learns by experience and accepts the rules with
sporadic rebellion but our boy acts as if they were beyond
comprehension And I think they are  to him
The first crime drama he happened to see on TV turned him white as
a sheet and when he stuck his nose out the gate a few days later and
watched some neighborhood kids playing cowboys and Indians with cap
pistols he was sick on the grass Explaining the glamour of the early
west made it worse He drew back from me as though I were contagious
I had the feeling that he pitied me I wonder sometimes whether he
makes any real sense at all out of what is said to him Hes very slow
to interpret the shades of expression possible in voice and face I feel
that potentially he has an exceptional mind but the great difficulty is
communication
Like pulling his leg Its too easy to be fun
Exactly unless the little soandso is pulling ours which I sometimes
suspect Phil winced a little and rubbed his hand across his forehead
Getting a headache Well whats this third item you had in mind
I cant pin it down but I have a feeling theres a fairly obvious
physical factor linking the periods of relapse
Physical tiredness
No  the contrary perhaps At the start he got himself overtired
pretty often as though he overestimated his endurance but it didnt
seem to do him any harm But if he awakens early or unexpectedly there
may be an appreciable delay before he orients himself Then he comes to
with a snap
Shock Confusion of any sort
Confusion certainly He didnt last five minutes when they tried
him in school you remember Howled for his dog then sat on the floor
and dribbled The confusion of being chucked into a group of noisy
aggressive sixyearolds was too much for him You remember he recovered
completelyalmost instantlywhen his mother packed him out of the
school
That reminds me of something else I think that dog is some sort of a
symbol to him Perhaps it has somehow become associated with security
Try this for size his mind is struggling to free itself from its strait
jacket the dog captures his attention at a critical moment the mother
screams when he speaks frightening him but the dog comes reassuringly
to his arms and subsequentlyor did he see it as a consequencehis
parents make much of him In other words at the start of his rational
life the dog is a friendly element and the parents a frightening one
The details of the association drop soon enough from his conscious
memory but not from his subconscious When the dog is with him he
feels secure When they are separatedit was not allowed into school
with him of coursehis symbol is gone and he panics much as an
ordinary child panics if it loses its mother in a crowd
Slick but not convincing It touches on another peculiarity however
the way he wants that hound with him always no matter where Sleeps
with it on his bed eats with it by his chair even takes it to the
bathroombytheby he acquired the dog and bowelcontrol at the same
time if you recallbut does he like the dog He never pets it to
speak of Plays with it sometimes in a clumsy disinterested sort of
way but its not the classic boydog relationship If the dog is merely
a symbol as you suggest
I didnt say merely a symbol If Im right an association as strong
as this one could be devilish awkward and even dangerous hooked to a
hairtrigger mind like his What if something happens to the dog before
his dependence or whatever can be broken Dogs get run over you know
and even their normal life span is short Maybe we ought to try to break
it up  damn this headache
RegretDespondency Degraded to pain  staticthick tongue
Resignation Delay delay delay  break conversation Time
wrong
You been bothered with headaches lately
Off and onnasty sort of twinges If I trusted myself with a
carpenter Id let you give me a checkup Well lets cut this short
What I was going to say  lets see  oh since Timmy seldom pays
any attention to the dog why does the dog stick to him like a shadow
Clancey grunted
That dogs no fool stupid as he is Clumsy homely and halfwitted
enough to sit on a tack for five minutes before he howledIve seen
him do just about thathe knows when he needs a protector If it
werent for Timmy the hound would have been destroyed long ago as
an act of mercy Helen and Jerry are resigned to him of course for
Timmys sake but have you noticed that the dog reacts much the same
as Timmy if they get separated Casts about at once for a way to
rejoin him and the longer hes delayed the more he panics Maybe its
a twoway switchmaybe Timmy and his dog are indispensable symbols to
each other
You dream up any more lulus like that you keep them to yourself
Psychopathic dogs I draw the line at Clancey there is only one
conclusion to be drawn from these here solemn deliberations Throw out
the textbooks and roll with the punches
Amen
V
There should be no deaths
Phil turned that one over in his mind cautiously A good deal of his
attention was needed for the task of nursing his old car along the ruts
of the dirt road but the murmured exclamation impelled him to steal a
glance at the boy sitting beside him This was the spring of Timmys
tenth yearthe sixth year of his friendship with Uncle Philand
those years had taught Phil more than he realized if less than he had
hoped He knew for example that the peculiar vacancy of Timmys
expression at the moment implied deep thought rather than the complete
absence of thought that it suggested That was a curious characteristic
that always made the man a little uneasy Timmys face was sometimes
radiantly spontaneously expressive the most sensitive of mirrors and
sometimes it was rather mechanically expressive but it was only
expressive in a positive sense In moments of abstraction or daydreaming
there was no faraway look no frown of concentration Only blankness
The world would get a trifle crowded you know
Timmy leaped the gap easily to connect the two remarks as Phil had
thought he would Oh I didnt mean there should be no death I was
thinking of something else That man they found dead in the bush
yesterday
A man with a heart condition should never go hunting alone
Was it his heart Uncle Phil
His heart and his head both if you ask me He had a bad heart all
rightI saw him have an attack once Youd think a man like that would
have sense enough to avoid overexertion but he lost his way and started
churning through swamp and brush in a straight line instead of looking
for the trail again Must have acted like a moron running until he
dropped
Would panic make a man do that
It will make a man do any crazy thing imaginable if he lets it get
the upper hand Theres only a few square miles of marsh and brush here
with the town already crowding up against it In a few years it will be
drained and the land used for industrial development and so on then the
fools will have to find some other way to kill themselves
What do you mean
Oh every so often we have to turn out search parties and have a grand
shivaree looking for some idiot who usually turns up dead Drowned
himself in two feet of water or run himself ragged or even put a
bullet through his head for no good reason Its happened several times
in the past few years so the place is getting a bad name it doesnt
deserve Even the search parties often get themselves balled up and mill
around in circles perfect examples of mass hysteria Sometimes I get
fed up with the human race
I  didnt know I mean about the  deaths
Phil laughed outright at the tragic tone
Oh come now Lets not be morbid about it You wanted to drive out
here remember
I still do Uncle Phil You and Dad were talking about how you used to
come out here every spring when you were kids to collect specimens and
it sounded like fun
So it was  in those days This old dirt road leads well in toward
the center I used to spend a whole day hiking along here with my dog
just rooting around and having a grand time Its a pity we outgrow
the best things in life Childhood scenes should be remembered not
revisited We can remember but we cant recapture A few years ago
I wanted some nature photographs so of course I came out here sure
Id get some beauties I dont know I started out in high spirits
recognizing every rotted old stump along the way but somehow it all
turned to ashes I lost interest and turned back without taking a single
exposurealmost hating the place in fact as if it had let me down
Strange that a place I loved as a kid should seem so empty and
uninviting now He put on the brakes and looked around morosely
Dont you want to go any farther Uncle Phil
What for You can see how overgrown the road is getting Ill be lucky
if I can find a clearing to turn around Theres nothing of interest up
ahead Timmy The road dies out and then theres a couple of miles or so
of swamp and flies Its getting dusk too
Id like to get out for a minute
Oh Well O K but make it snappy
He settled back listlessly as the boy climbed out holding the door for
the dog to follow
Do you have to take that mutt  never mind go ahead
The boy wandered off to the side of the road and Phil listened to the
rustle of bushes wondering at his own irritation He felt ill at ease
anxious to be away He started as Timmy came up beside him on the left
of the car
That was quick
Yeah The boy was holding a spray of flowering shrub and his hand
passed casually over the flowers in a light caress Say hasnt this
flower got a sweet smell Uncle Phil Here smell it
Its a pretty flower Timmy but that stuff has no perfume He
accepted the branch automatically lifted it to his nostrils
Time stopped
He thought he felt a thump against the side of the car but the
impression faded before it was fully born In a remote corner of his
mind the ticking of his watch sounded as a cold measured rhythm a
metronome with delusions of syncopation He sat motionless his forearm
resting on the steering wheel the spray of blossoms caressing his
cheek his mind stunned by the anaesthetic he drew in with each breath
He was as one lost in thought his eyes open but unseeing observing but
not interpreting
There was no sense of duration of the passage of seconds or minutes
There was only a dream in which suddenly a gentle mind made its
presence known Concepts tapped lightly at his own mind and an automatic
process of interpretation winnowed and equated until a gentle voice
seemed to speak The words were few merely computed associations
keyed to understanding and with them were perfectly and intimately
synchronized fragments of emotion and vision softly washing over the
surface of his mind
Urgency Attendattend Challonari Attend
An impression of convolutions drifted through his minda shape
perhaps and a color He felt no curiosity and let the impression
drift As a sunbather drowsing on a crowded beach hearing the
background hum of the crowd and now and then a more clearly spoken
phrase so he caught the edge of this communication It was not for
him A second mind entered  was it a mind Yes and yet very
different It was strong but limitedperhaps childlike in some ways
Alive after a fashion it was receptive of emotion up to a point and
even capable of emotionup to a point It seemed an embryo mind in
some ways well developed and in others with no potential whatever
