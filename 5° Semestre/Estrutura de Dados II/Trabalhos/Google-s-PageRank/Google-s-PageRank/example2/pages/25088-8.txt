Kingdomes of Europe are not merely Inland but girt with the Sea most part
of their Compasse and because the Wealth of both Indies seemes in great
Part but an Accessary to the Command of the Seas1
1 Bacons Essay on The Greatness of Kingdoms first
published in 1597 The extract is from the edition of 1625
The three centuries that have gone by since this was written have afforded
ample confirmation of the view here set forth as to the importance of
Battailes by Sea and the supreme value of the Command of the Sea Not
only we of Europe but our kindred in America and our allies in Far
Eastern Asia have now their proudly cherished memories of decisive naval
victory
I propose to tell in nontechnical and popular language the story of some
of the most remarkable episodes in the history of sea power I shall begin
with the first seafight of which we have a detailed historythe Battle of
Salamis BC 480 the victory by which Themistocles the Athenian proved
the soundness of his maxim that he who commands the sea commands all I
shall end with the last and greatest of naval engagements the Battle of
Tsushima an event that reversed the long experience of victory won by
West over East which began with Salamis more than two thousand years ago
I shall have to tell of British triumphs on the sea from Sluys to
Trafalgar but I shall take instances from the history of other countries
also for it is well that we should remember that the skill enterprise
and courage of admirals and seamen is no exclusive possession of our own
people
I shall incidentally describe the gradual evolution of the warship from the
wooden oardriven galleys that fought in the Straits of Salamis to the
steelbuilt steampropelled giants that met in battle in the Straits of
Tsushima I shall have something to say of old seafaring ways and much to
tell of the brave deeds done by men of many nations These true stories of
the sea will I trust have not only the interest that belongs to all
records of courage danger and adventure but also some practical lessons
of their own for they may help to keep alive that intelligent popular
interest in sea power which is the best guarantee that the interests of our
own navythe best safeguard of the Empirewill not be neglected no
matter what Government is in power or what political views may happen for
the moment to be in the ascendant

FROM SALAMIS TO TSUSHIMA
CHAPTER I
SALAMIS
BC 480
The world has lost all record of the greatest of its inventorsthe
pioneers who in faroff ages devised the simple appliances with which men
tilled the ground did their domestic work and fought their battles for
thousands of years He who hung up the first weavers beam and shaped the
first rude shuttle was a more wonderful inventor than Arkwright The maker
of the first bow and arrow was a more enterprising pioneer than our
inventors of machineguns And greater than the builders of Dreadnoughts
were those who with hearts girt round with oak and triple brass were the
first to trust their frail barques to the cruel sea No doubt the
hollowed tree trunk and the coracle of osiers and skins had long before
this made their trial trips on river and lake Then came the first ventures
in the shallow seamargins and at last a primitive naval architect built
up planked bulwarks round his hollowed tree trunk and stiffened them with
ribs of bent branches and the first ship was launched
This evolution of the ship must have been in progress independently in more
places than one We are most concerned with its development in that eastern
end of the landlocked Mediterranean which is the meetingplace of so
many races and around which so much of what is most momentous in the
worlds history has happened There seems good reason for believing that
among the pioneers in early naval construction were the men of that
marvellous people of old Egypt to whom the worlds civilization owes so
much They had doubtless learned their work on their own Nile before they
pushed out by the channels of the Delta to the waters of the Great Sea
They had invented the sail though it was centuries before any one learned
to do more than scud before the wind It took long experience of the sea to
discover that one could fix ones sail at an oblique angle with the
midline of the ship and play off rudder against sail to lay a course with
the wind on the quarter or even abeam and not dead astern
But there was as important an invention as the sailthat of the oar We
are so familiar with it that we do not realize all it means Yet it is a
notable fact that whole races of men who navigate river lake and sea
successfully and boldly never hit upon the principle of the oar till they
were taught it by Europeans and could of themselves get no further than
the paddle The oar with its leverage its capacity for making the very
weight of the crew become a motive power became in more senses than one
the great instrument of progress on the sea It gave the ship a power of
manoeuvring independently of the wind the same power that is the essence
of advantage in steam propulsion The centuries during which the sailing
ship was the chief reliance of navigation and commerce were after all an
episode between the long ages when the oardriven galley was the typical
ship and the present age of steam beginning less than a hundred years ago
Sails were an occasional help to the early navigator Our songs of the sea
call them the white wings of the ship For the Greek poet schylus the
wings of the ship were the long oars The trader creeping along the coast
or working from island to island helping himself when the wind served with
his sail and having only a small crew could not afford much oarpower
though he had often to trust to it But for the fighting ship oarpower
and speed were as important as mechanical horsepower is for the warships
of the twentieth century So the war galley was built longer than the
trader to make room for as many oars as possible on either side In the
Mediterranean in those early days as with the Vikings of later centuries
the Long Ship meant the ship of war
It is strange to reflect that all through human history war has been a
greater incentive to shipbuilding progress than peaceful commerce For
those early navigators the prizes to be won by fighting and raiding were
greater than any that the more prosaic paths of trade could offer The
fleets that issued from the Delta of the Nile were piratical squadrons
that were the terrors of the Mediterranean coasts The Greek too like the
Norseman began his career on the sea with piracy The Athenian historian
tells of days when it was no offence to ask a seafaring man Are you a
pirate sir The first Admirals of the Eastern Mediterranean had
undoubtedly more likeness to Captain Kidd and Blackbeard than to Nelson
and Collingwood Later came the time when organized Governments in the
Greek cities and on the Phoenician coast kept fleets on the landlocked sea
to deal with piracy and protect peaceful commerce But the prizes that
allured the corsair were so tempting that piracy revived again and again
and even in the late days of the Roman Republic the Consul Pompey had to
conduct a maritime war on a large scale to clear the sea of the pirates
Of the early naval wars of the Mediterraneanbattles of more or less
piratical fleets or of the war galleys of coast and island stateswe have
no clear record or no vestige of a record Egyptians Phoenicians
Cretans men of the rich island state of which we have only recently found
the remains in buried palaces Greeks of the Asiatic mainland and their
Eastern neighbours Greeks of the islands and the Peninsula Illyrians of
the labyrinth of creek and island that fringes the Adriatic Sicilians and
Carthaginians all had their adventures and battles on the sea in the dim
beginnings of history Homer has his catalogue of ships set forth in
stately verse telling how the Greek chieftains led 120000 warriors
embarked on 1100 galleys to the siege of Troy But no hostile fleet met
them if indeed the great armament ever sailed as to which historians and
critics dispute One must pass on for centuries after Homers day to find
reliable and detailed records of early naval war The first great battle on
the sea of which we can tell the story was the fight in the Straits of
Salamis when Greek and Persian strove for the mastery of the near East
King Darius had found that his hold on the Greek cities of Asia Minor was
insecure so long as they could look for armed help to their kindred beyond
the Archipelago and he had sent his satraps to raid the Greek mainland
That first invasion ended disastrously at Marathon His son Xerxes took
up the quarrel and devoted years to the preparation not of a raid upon
Europe but of an invasion in which the whole power of his vast empire was
to be put forth by sea and land
It was fortunate for Greece that the man who then counted for most in the
politics of Athens was one who recognized the allimportance of seapower
though it is likely that at the outset all he had in mind was that the
possession of an efficient fleet would enable his city to exert its
influence on the islands and among the coast cities to the exclusion of the
military power of its rival Sparta When it was proposed that the product
of the silver mines of Laurium should be distributed among the Athenian
citizens it was Themistocles who persuaded his fellowcountrymen that a
better investment for the public wealth would be found in the building and
equipment of a fleet He used as one of his arguments the probability that
the Persian King would sooner or later try to avenge the defeat of
Marathon A no less effective argument was the necessity of protecting
their growing commerce Athens looked upon the sea and that sea at once
divided and united the scattered Greek communities who lived on the coasts
and islands of the Archipelago It was the possession of the fleet thus
acquired that enabled Themistocles and Athens to play a decisive part in
the crisis of the struggle with Asia
It was in the spring of BC 480 that the march from Asia Minor began The
vast multitude gathered from every land in Western Asia from the shores of
the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf and the wild mountain plateaux of the
Indian border was too numerous to be transported in any fleet that even
the Great King could assemble For seven days and nights it poured across
the floating bridge that swayed with the current of the Dardanelles a
bridge that was a wonder of early military engineering and the making of
which would tax the resources of the best army of today Then it marched
by the coastline through what is now Roumelia and Thessaly It ate up the
supplies of the lands through which it passed If it was to escape famine
it must keep in touch with the ships that crossed and recrossed the narrow
seas bringing heavy cargoes of food and forage from the ports of Asia and
escorted by squadrons of long war galleys
Every Greek city had been warned of the impending danger Even those who
remembered Marathon the day when a few thousand spearmen had routed an
Asiatic horde outnumbering them tenfold realized that any force that now
could be put in the field would be overwhelmed by this human tide of a
million fighting men But there was one soldierstatesman who saw the way
to safety and grasped the central fact of the situation This was
Themistocles the Athenian the chief man of that city against which the
first fury of the attack would be directed No doubt it was he who inspired
the prophetess of Delphi with her mysterious message that the Athenians
must make for themselves wooden walls and he supplied the explanation of
the enigma
The Persian must be met not on the land but in wooden walls upon the
sea Victory upon that element would mean the destruction of the huge army
on land The greater its numbers the more helpless would be its position
It could not live upon the country there must be a continual stream of
seaborne supplies arriving from Asia and this would be interrupted and
cease altogether once the Greeks were masters of the sea
The Athens of the time was not the wonderful city that arose in later
years embellished by the masterpieces of some of the greatest architects
and artists the world has ever known The houses huddled round the foot of
the citadel hillthe Acropoliswhich was crowned with rudely built
primitive temples But the people whose home it was were startled by the
proposal of Themistocles that their city should be abandoned to the enemy
without one blow struck in its defence Not Athens only but every village
and farm in the surrounding country was to be deserted Men women and
children horses and cattle were all to be conveyed across the narrow
strait to the island of Salamis which was to be the temporary refuge of
the citizens of Athens and of the countryfolk of Attica
Would they ever return to their ruined homes and devastated lands where
they would find houses burned and vines and olives cut down Could they
even hope to maintain themselves in Salamis Would it not be better to
fight in defence of their homes even against desperate odds and meet their
fate at once instead of only deferring the evil day It was no easy task
for the man of the moment to persuade his fellowcountrymen to adopt his
own farsighted plans Even when most of them had accepted his leadership
and were obeying his orders a handful of desperate men refused to go They
took refuge on the hill of the Acropolis and acting upon the literal
meaning of the oracle toiled with axe and hammer building up wooden
barriers before the gates of the old citadel
Everywhere else the city and the country round were soon deserted The
people streamed down to the shore and were ferried over to Salamis where
huts of straw and branches rose up in wide extended camps to shelter the
crowds that could find no place in the island villages In every wood on
either shore trees were being felled In every creek shipwrights were busy
night and day building new ships or refitting old To every Greek seaport
messages had been sent begging them to send to the Straits of Salamis as
many ships oarsmen and fighting men as they could muster
Slowly the Persian army moved southward through Thessaly A handful of
Spartans under Leonidas had been sent forward to delay the Persian
advance They held the Pass of Thermopyl between the eastern shoulder of
Mount ta and the sea It was a hopeless position To fight there at all
with such an insignificant force was a mistake But the Government of
Sparta slaves to tradition could not grasp the idea of the plans proposed
by the great Athenian They were half persuaded to recall Leonidas but
hesitated to act until it was too late The Spartan chief and his few
hundred warriors died at their post in selfsacrificing obedience to the
letter of their orders The Persians poured over the Pass and inundated the
plains of Attica The few Athenians who had persisted in defending the
Acropolis of Athens made only a brief resistance against overwhelming
numbers They were all put to the sword and their fellowcountrymen in the
island of Salamis saw far off the pall of smoke that hung over their city
where temples and houses alike were sacked and set on fire by the victors
The winds and waves had already been fighting for the Greeks The Persian
war fleet of 1200 great ships had coasted southwards by the shores of
Thessaly till they neared the group of islands off the northern point of
Euboea Their scouts reported a Greek fleet to be lying in the channel
between the large island and the mainland Night was coming on and the
Persians anchored in eight long lines off Cape Sepias As the sun rose
there came one of those sudden gales from the eastward that are still the
terror of small craft in the Archipelago A modern sailor would try to beat
out to seaward and get as far as possible from the dangerous shore but
these oldworld seamen dreaded the open sea They tried to ride out the
gale but anchors dragged and hundreds of ships were piled in shattered
masses on the shore Some were stranded in positions where they could be
repaired and refloated as the weather cleared up but by the evening of the
third day when at last the wind fell only eight hundred galleys of the
Persian armada were still in seaworthy fighting condition
Here as on other occasions the very numbers of the Persian fleet proved a
source of danger to it The harbours that could give shelter to this
multitude of ships were very few and far between nor was it an easy matter
to find that other refuge of the ancient navigatora beach of easy slope
and sufficiently wide extent to enable the ships to be dragged out of the
water and placed high and dry beyond the reach of the angriest waves The
fact that ships were beached and hauled up the shore during bad weather
and in winter limited their size and in both the Persian and the Greek
fleets there probably was not a ship much bigger than the barges we see on
our canals or as big as some of the largest seagoing barges
The typical warship of the period of the Persian War was probably not more
than eighty or a hundred feet long narrow and nearly flatbottomed At
the bow and stern there was a strongly built deck Between this poop and
forecastle a lighter deck ran fore and aft and under this were the
stations of the rowers The bow was strengthened with plates of iron or
brass and beams of oak to enable it to be used as a ram and the stem
rose above the deck level and was carved into the head of some bird or
beast There was a light mast which could be rigged up when the wind
served and carried a crossyard and a square sail Mast and yard were
taken down before going into action
The Greeks called their war galleys trieres the Romans triremes and
these names are generally explained as meaning that the ships were
propelled by three banks or rows of oars placed one above the other on
either side The widely accepted theory of how they were worked is that the
seats of the rowers were placed not directly above each other but that
those who worked the lowest and shortest oars were close to the side of the
ship the men for the middle range of oars a little above them and further
inboard and the upper tier of rowers still higher and near the centreline
of the ship An endless amount of erudition and research has been expended
on this question but most of those who have dealt with it have been
classical scholars possessing little or no practical acquaintance with
seafaring conditions and none of their proposed arrangements of three
banks of oars looks at all likely to be workable and effective A practical
test of the theory was made by Napoleon III when his History of Julius
Csar was being prepared He had a trireme constructed and tried upon the
Seine There were three banks of oars but though the fitting and
arrangement was changed again and again under the joint advice of classical
experts and practical seamen no satisfactory method of working the
superposed banks of oars could be devised
The probability is that no such method of working was ever generally
employed and that the belief in the existence of oldworld navies made up
of ships with tier on tier of oars on either side is the outcome of a
misunderstanding as to the meaning of a word Trieres and trireme seems
at first glance to mean tripleoared in the sense of the oars being
triplicated but there are strong arguments for the view that it was not
the oars but the oarsmen who were arranged in threes If this view is
correct the ancient warship was a galley with a single row of long oars on
either side and three men pulling together each heavy oar We know that in
the old navies of the Papal States and the Republics of Venice and Genoa in
the Middle Ages and the days of the Renaissance and in the royal galleys
of the old French monarchy there were no ships with superposed banks of
oars but there were galleys known as triremes quadriremes and
pentaremes driven by long oars each worked by three four or five
rowers It is at least very likely that this was the method adopted in the
warships of still earlier times
A trireme of the days of the Persian War with fifty or sixty oars would
thus have a crew of 150 or 180 rowers Add to this some fifty or sixty
fighting men and we have a total crew of over two hundred In the Persian
navies the rowers were mostly slaves like the galley slaves of later
times They were chained to their oars and kept in order or roused to
exertion by the whip of their taskmasters To train them to work together
effectively required a long apprenticeship and in rough water their work
was especially difficult To miss the regular time of the stroke was
dangerous for the long oars projecting far inboard would knock down and
injure the nearest rowers unless all swung accurately together The
flatbottomed galleys rolled badly in a heavy sea and in rough weather
rowing was fatiguing and even perilous work
Some two hundred men in a small ship meant crowded quarters and lack of
room everywhere except on the fighting deck But as the fleets hugged the
shore and generally lay up for the night the crews could mostly land to
cook eat and sleep In the Persian ships belonging to many nations and
some of them to the Greek cities of Asia Xerxes took the precaution of
having at least thirty picked Persian warriors in each crew Their presence
was intended to secure the fidelity of the rest
In the Greek fleet the rowers were partly slaves partly freemen impressed
or hired for the work Then there were a few seamen fishermen or men who
in the days of peace manned the local coasting craft The chiefs of this
navigating party were the keleustes who presided over the rowers and
gave the signal for each stroke and the pilot who was supposed to have a
knowledge of the local waters and of wind and weather and who acted as
steersman handling alone or with the help of his assistants the long
stern oar that served as a rudder The fighting men were not sailors but
soldiers embarked to fight afloat and their military chief commanded the
ship with the help of the pilot For more than two thousand years this
division between the sailor and the fighting element in navies continued
throughout the world The fighting commander and the sailingmaster were
two different men and the captain of a manofwar was often a landsman
In the Greek fleet which lay sheltered in the narrows behind the long
island of Euboea while the Persians were battling with the tempest off Cape
Sepias the Admiral was the Spartan Eurybiades a veteran General who knew
more about forming a phalanx of spearmen than directing the movements of a
fleet The military reputation of his race had secured for him the chief
command though of the whole fleet of between three and four hundred
triremes less than a third had been provided by Sparta and her allies and
half of the armada was formed of the wellequipped Athenian fleet
commanded by Themistocles in person As the storm abated the fleets faced
each other in the strait north of Euboea In the Persian armada the best
ships were five long galleys commanded by an Amazon queen Artemisia of
Halicarnassus a Greek fighting against Greeks She scored the first
success swooping down with her squadron on a Greek galley that had
ventured to scout along the Persian front in the grey of the morning
Attacked by the five the ship was taken and the victors celebrated their
success by hanging the commander over the prow of his ship cutting his
throat and letting his blood flow into the sea an offering to the gods of
the deep The cruel deed was something that inspired no particular sense of
horror in those days of heathen war It was probably not on account of this
piece of barbarity but out of their anger at being opposed by a woman and
a Greek woman that the allied leaders of Greece set a price on the head of
the Amazon queen but no one ever succeeded in qualifying to claim it
The Persians hoping to gain an advantage from their superior numbers now
detached a squadron which was to coast along the eastern shores of Euboea
enter the strait at its southern end and fall on the rear of the Greeks
while the main body attacked them in front Eurybiades and Themistocles had
early intelligence of this movement but were not alarmed by it Shortly
before sunset the Greeks bore down on the Persians attacked them in the
narrow waters where their numbers could not tell sank some thirty ships by
ramming them and then drew off as the night came on
It was a wild night The Greeks had hardly regained their sheltered
anchorage when the wind rose lightning played round the mountain crests on
either hand the thunder rolled and the rain came down in torrents The
main Persian fleet in a less sheltered position found it difficult to
avoid disaster and the crews were horrified at seeing as the lightning lit
up the sea masses of debris and swollen corpses of drowned men drifting
amongst them as the currents brought the wreckage of the earlier storm
floating down from beyond Cape Sepias The hundred ships detached to round
the south point of Euboea were still slowly making their way along its
rocky eastern coast Caught in the midnight storm most of them drove ashore
and were dashed to pieces
In the morning the sea was still rough but the Greeks came out of the
strait and without committing themselves to a general action fell upon
the nearest ships the squadron of Cilicia and sank and captured several
of them retiring when the main fleet began to close upon them On the
third day the sea was calm and the Persians tried to force the narrows by a
frontal attack There was some hard fighting and loss on both sides but
the Greeks held their own As the sun set the Persians rowed back towards
their anchorage inside Cape Sepias
When the sun rose again the Greek fleet had disappeared Eurybiades and
Themistocles had agreed in the night after the battle that the time was
come to abandon the defence of the Euboean Strait and retire to the waters
of Salamis The Persian army was now flooding the mainland with its myriads
of fighting men and was master of Attica A fleet depending so much on
the land for supplies and for rest for its crews could not maintain itself
in the straits when the Persians held the mainland and were in a position
to seize also the island of Euboea Before sunrise the Greek ships were
working their way in long procession through the Strait of Negropont Early
in the day they began to pass one by one the narrows at Chalcis now
spanned by a bridge Then the strait widened and there were none to bar
their way to the open sea and round Cape Sunium to their sheltered station
in the straits behind the island of Salamis
They had been reinforced on the way and they now numbered 366 fighting
ships Those of Sparta and the Peloponnesus were 89 the Athenian fleet
180 while 97 more were supplied by the Greek islands some of the ships
from Melos and the Cyclades being penteconters large vessels whose long
oars were each manned by five rowers Losses by storm and battle had
reduced the Persian armada to some six hundred effective ships The odds
were serious but not desperate
But while the Persian fleet was directed by a single will there were
divided counsels among the Greeks Eurybiades had most of the leaders on
his side when he argued that Athens was hopelessly lost and the best hope
for Greece was to defend the Peloponnesus by holding the isthmus of
Corinth with what land forces could be assembled and removing the fleet to
the waters of the neighbouring waters to cooperate in the defence
Themistocles on the other hand shrank from the idea of abandoning the
refugees in the island of Salamis and he regarded the adjacent straits as
the best position in which the Greeks could give battle There as in the
channel of Euboea the narrow waters would do something to nullify the
Persian advantage of numbers For the Greeks formed in several lines
extending from shore to shore could only be attacked by equal numbers
Only the leading ships of the attack would be in action at any given
moment and it would not matter how many hundred more were crowded behind
them With a column of spearmen on land the weight of the rearward ranks
