which he might fairly take advantage of his position and say at large
whatever he was in the humour for saying at the moment
I should not have thought this possible if I had not ere now had reason
to set Mr Romanes down as one who was not likely to be squeamish about
trifles  Nevertheless on this present occasion I certainly did think
that he had only made a slip such as we all make sometimes and such as
he would gladly take the earliest opportunity to correct  As it is I do
not know what to think except that DCLs and FRSs seem to be made
of much the same frail materials as we ordinary mortals are
As regards the extracts from my previous books given in this volume I
should say that I have revised and corrected the original text
throughout and introduced a sentence or two here and there but have
nowhere made any important alteration  I regret greatly that want of
space has prevented me from being able to give the chapters from Life and
Habit on The Abeyance of Memory and What we should expect to find if
Differentiations of Structure and Instinct are mainly due to Memory it
is in these chapters that an explanation of many phenomena is given of
which so far as I know no explanation of any kind had been previously
attempted and in which phenomena having apparently so little connection
as the sterility of hybrids the principle underlying longevity the
resumption of feral characteristics the sterility of many animals under
confinement are not only made intelligible but are shown to be all part
and parcel of the same storyall being explicable as soon as Memory is
made the main factor of heredity

SELECTIONS FROM EREWHON 1
CURRENT OPINIONS  CHAPTER X OF EREWHON
This is what I gathered  That in that country if a man falls into ill
health or catches any disorder or fails bodily in any way before he is
seventy years old he is tried before a jury of his countrymen and if
convicted is held up to public scorn and sentenced more or less severely
as the case may be  There are subdivisions of illnesses into crimes and
misdemeanours as with offences amongst ourselvesa man being punished
very heavily for serious illness while failure of eyes or hearing in one
over sixtyfive who has had good health hitherto is dealt with by fine
only or imprisonment in default of payment
But if a man forges a cheque sets his house on fire robs with violence
from the person or does any other such things as are criminal in our own
country he is either taken to a hospital and most carefully tended at
the public expense or if he is in good circumstances he lets it be
known to all his friends that he is suffering from a severe fit of
immorality just as we do when we are ill and they come and visit him
with great solicitude and inquire with interest how it all came about
what symptoms first showed themselves and so forthquestions which he
will answer with perfect unreserve for bad conduct though considered no
less deplorable than illness with ourselves and as unquestionably
indicating something wrong with the individual who misbehaves is
nevertheless held to be the result of either prenatal or postnatal
misfortune  I should add that under certain circumstances poverty and
ill luck are also considered criminal
Accordingly there exists a class of men trained in soulcraft whom they
call straighteners as nearly as I can translate a word which literally
means one who bendeth back the crooked  These men practise much as
medical men in England and receive a quasisurreptitious fee on every
visit  They are treated with the same unreserve and obeyed just as
readily as our own doctorsthat is to say on the whole
sufficientlybecause people know that it is their interest to get well
as soon as they can and that they will not be scouted as they would be
if their bodies were out of order even though they may have to undergo a
very painful course of treatment
When I say that they will not be scouted I do not mean that an
Erewhonian offender will suffer no social inconvenience  Friends will
fall away from him because of his being less pleasant company just as we
ourselves are disclined to make companions of those who are either poor
or poorly  No one with a due sense of selfrespect will place himself on
an equality in the matter of affection with those who are less lucky than
himself in birth health money good looks capacity or anything else
Indeed that dislike and even disgust should be felt by the fortunate for
the unfortunate or at any rate for those who have been discovered to
have met with any of the more serious and less familiar misfortunes is
not only natural but desirable for any society whether of man or brute
what progress either of body or soul had been otherwise possible  The
fact therefore that the Erewhonians attach none of that guilt to crime
which they do to physical ailments does not prevent the more selfish
among them from neglecting a friend who has robbed a bank for instance
till he has fully recovered but it does prevent them from even thinking
of treating criminals with that contemptuous tone which would seem to
say I if I were you should be a better man than you are a tone
which is held quite reasonable in regard to physical ailment
Hence though they conceal ill health by every kind of cunning they are
quite open about even the most flagrant mental diseases should they
happen to exist which to do the people justice is not often  Indeed
there are some who so to speak are spiritual valetudinarians and who
make themselves exceedingly ridiculous by their nervous supposition that
they are wicked while they are very tolerable people all the time  This
however is exceptional and on the whole they use much the same reserve
or unreserve about the state of their moral welfare as we do about our
health
It has followed that all the ordinary greetings among ourselves such as
How do you do and the like are considered signs of gross illbreeding
nor do the politer classes tolerate even such a common complimentary
remark as telling a man that he was looking well  They salute each other
with I hope you are good this morning or I hope you have recovered
from the snappishness from which you were suffering when I last saw you
and if the person saluted has not been good or is still snappish he
says so and is condoled with accordingly  Nay the straighteners have
gone so far as to give names from the hypothetical language as taught at
the Colleges of Unreason to all known forms of mental indisposition and
have classified them according to a system of their own which though I
could not understand it seemed to work well in practice for they are
always able to tell a man what is the matter with him as soon as they
have heard his story and their familiarity with the long names assures
him that they thoroughly understand his case
We in England rarely shrink from telling our doctor what is the matter
with us merely through the fear that he will hurt us  We let him do his
worst upon us and stand it without a murmur because we are not scouted
for being ill and because we know the doctor is doing his best to cure
us and can judge of our case better than we can but we should conceal
all illness if we were treated as the Erewhonians are when they have
anything the matter with them we should do as we do with our moral and
intellectual diseaseswe should feign health with the most consummate
art till we were found out and should hate a single flogging given by
way of mere punishment more than the amputation of a limb if it were
kindly and courteously performed from a wish to help us out of our
difficulty and with the full consciousness on the part of the doctor
that it was only by an accident of constitution that he was not in the
like plight himself  So the Erewhonians take a flogging once a week and
a diet of bread and water for two or three months together whenever
their straightener recommends it
I do not suppose that even my host on having swindled a confiding widow
out of the whole of her property was put to more actual suffering than a
man will readily undergo at the hands of an English doctor  And yet he
must have had a very bad time of it  The sounds I heard were sufficient
to show that his pain was exquisite but he never shrank from undergoing
it  He was quite sure that it did him good and I think he was right  I
cannot believe that that man will ever embezzle money again  He maybut
it will be a long time before he does so
During my confinement in prison and on my journey I had discovered much
of the above but it still seemed new and strange and I was in constant
fear of committing some rudeness from my inability to look at things from
the same standpoint as my neighbours but after a few weeks stay with
the Nosnibors I got to understand things better especially on having
heard all about my hosts illness of which he told me fully and
repeatedly
It seemed he had been on the Stock Exchange of the city for many years
and had amassed enormous wealth without exceeding the limits of what was
generally considered justifiable or at any rate permissible dealing but
at length on several occasions he had become aware of a desire to make
money by fraudulent representations and had actually dealt with two or
three sums in a way which had made him rather uncomfortable  He had
unfortunately made light of it and poohpoohed the ailment until
circumstances eventually presented themselves which enabled him to cheat
upon a very considerable scalehe told me what they were and they were
about as bad as anything could be but I need not detail themhe seized
the opportunity and became aware when it was too late that he must be
seriously out of order  He had neglected himself too long
He drove home at once broke the news to his wife and daughters as gently
as he could and sent off for one of the most celebrated straighteners of
the kingdom to a consultation with the family practitioner for the case
was plainly serious  On the arrival of the straightener he told his
story and expressed his fear that his morals must be permanently
impaired
The eminent man reassured him with a few cheering words and then
proceeded to make a more careful diagnosis of the case  He inquired
concerning Mr Nosnibors parentshad their moral health been good  He
was answered that there had not been anything seriously amiss with them
but that his maternal grandfather whom he was supposed to resemble
somewhat in person had been a consummate scoundrel and had ended his
days in a hospitalwhile a brother of his fathers after having led a
most flagitious life for many years had been at last cured by a
philosopher of a new school which as far as I could understand it bore
much the same relation to the old as homoeopathy to allopathy  The
straightener shook his head at this and laughingly replied that the cure
must have been due to nature  After a few more questions he wrote a
prescription and departed
I saw the prescription  It ordered a fine to the State of double the
money embezzled no food but bread and milk for six months and a severe
flogging once a month for twelve  He had received his eleventh flogging
on the day of my arrival  I saw him later on the same afternoon and he
was still twinged but even though he had been minded to do so which he
showed no sign of being there would have been no escape from following
out the straighteners prescription for the socalled sanitary laws of
Erewhon are very rigorous and unless the straightener was satisfied that
his orders had been obeyed the patient would have been taken to a
hospital as the poor are and would have been much worse off  Such at
least is the law but it is never necessary to enforce it
On a subsequent occasion I was present at an interview between Mr
Nosnibor and the family straightener who was considered competent to
watch the completion of the cure  I was struck with the delicacy with
which he avoided even the remotest semblance of inquiry after the
physical wellbeing of his patient though there was a certain yellowness
about my hosts eyes which argued a bilious habit of body  To have taken
notice of this would have been a gross breach of professional etiquette
I am told that a straightener sometimes thinks it right to glance at the
possibility of some slight physical disorder if he finds it important in
order to assist him in his diagnosis but the answers which he gets are
generally untrue or evasive and he forms his own conclusions upon the
matter as well as he can
Sensible men have been known to say that the straightener should in
strict confidence be told of every physical ailment that is likely to
bear upon the case but people are naturally shy of doing this for they
do not like lowering themselves in the opinion of the straightener and
his ignorance of medical science is supreme  I heard of one lady however
who had the hardihood to confess that a furious outbreak of illhumour
and extravagant fancies for which she was seeking advice was possibly the
result of indisposition  You should resist that said the
straightener in a kind but grave voice we can do nothing for the
bodies of our patients such matters are beyond our province and I
desire that I may hear no further particulars  The lady burst into
tears promised faithfully that she would never be unwell again and kept
her word
To return however to Mr Nosnibor  As the afternoon wore on many
carriages drove up with callers to inquire how he had stood his flogging
It had been very severe but the kind inquiries upon every side gave him
great pleasure and he assured me that he felt almost tempted to do wrong
again by the solicitude with which his friends had treated him during his
recovery in this I need hardly say that he was not serious
During the remainder of my stay in the country Mr Nosnibor was
constantly attentive to his business and largely increased his already
great possessions but I never heard a whisper to the effect of his
having been indisposed a second time or made money by other than the
most strictly honourable means  I did hear afterwards in confidence that
there had been reason to believe that his health had been not a little
affected by the straighteners treatment but his friends did not choose
to be over curious upon the subject and on his return to his affairs it
was by common consent passed over as hardly criminal in one who was
otherwise so much afflicted  For they regard bodily ailments as the more
venial in proportion as they have been produced by causes independent of
the constitution  Thus if a person ruin his health by excessive
indulgence at the table or by drinking they count it to be almost a
part of the mental disease which brought it about and so it goes for
little but they have no mercy on such illnesses as fevers or catarrhs or
lung diseases which to us appear to be beyond the control of the
individual  They are only more lenient towards the diseases of the
youngsuch as measles which they think to be like sowing ones wild
oatsand look over them as pardonable indiscretions if they have not
been too serious and if they are atoned for by complete subsequent
recovery
AN EREWHONIAN TRIAL  CHAPTER XI OF EREWHON
I shall best convey to the reader an idea of the entire perversion of
thought which exists among this extraordinary people by describing the
public trial of a man who was accused of pulmonary consumptionan
offence which was punished with death until quite recently  The trial
did not take place till I had been some months in the country and I am
deviating from chronological order in giving an account of it here but I
had perhaps better do so in order to exhaust this subject before
proceeding with others
The prisoner was placed in the dock and the jury were sworn much as in
Europe almost all our own modes of procedure were reproduced even to
the requiring the prisoner to plead guilty or not guilty  He pleaded not
guilty and the case proceeded  The evidence for the prosecution was very
strong but I must do the court the justice to observe that the trial was
absolutely impartial  Counsel for the prisoner was allowed to urge
everything that could be said in his defence
The line taken was that the prisoner was simulating consumption in order
to defraud an insurance company from which he was about to buy an
annuity and that he hoped thus to obtain it on more advantageous terms
If this could have been shown to be the case he would have escaped
criminal prosecution and been sent to a hospital as for moral ailment
The view however was one which could not be reasonably sustained in
spite of all the ingenuity and eloquence of one of the most celebrated
advocates of the country  The case was only too clear for the prisoner
was almost at the point of death and it was astonishing that he had not
been tried and convicted long previously  His coughing was incessant
during the whole trial and it was all that the two jailers in charge of
him could do to keep him on his legs until it was over
The summing up of the judge was admirable  He dwelt upon every point
that could be construed in favour of the prisoner but as he proceeded it
became clear that the evidence was too convincing to admit of doubt and
there was but one opinion in the court as to the impending verdict when
the jury retired from the box  They were absent for about ten minutes
and on their return the foreman pronounced the prisoner guilty  There
was a faint murmur of applause but it was instantly repressed  The judge
then proceeded to pronounce sentence in words which I can never forget
and which I copied out into a notebook next day from the report that was
published in the leading newspaper  I must condense it somewhat and
nothing which I could say would give more than a faint idea of the
solemn not to say majestic severity with which it was delivered  The
sentence was as follows
Prisoner at the bar you have been accused of the great crime of
labouring under pulmonary consumption and after an impartial trial
before a jury of your countrymen you have been found guilty  Against
the justice of the verdict I can say nothing the evidence against you
was conclusive and it only remains for me to pass such a sentence upon
you as shall satisfy the ends of the law  That sentence must be a very
severe one  It pains me much to see one who is yet so young and whose
prospects in life were otherwise so excellent brought to this
distressing condition by a constitution which I can only regard as
radically vicious but yours is no case for compassion this is not your
first offence you have led a career of crime and have only profited by
the leniency shown you upon past occasions to offend yet more seriously
against the laws and institutions of your country  You were convicted of
aggravated bronchitis last year and I find that though you are now only
twentythree years old you have been imprisoned on no less than fourteen
occasions for illnesses of a more or less hateful character in fact it
is not too much to say that you have spent the greater part of your life
in a jail
It is all very well for you to say that you came of unhealthy parents
and had a severe accident in your childhood which permanently undermined
your constitution excuses such as these are the ordinary refuge of the
criminal but they cannot for one moment be listened to by the ear of
justice  I am not here to enter upon curious metaphysical questions as
to the origin of this or thatquestions to which there would be no end
were their introduction once tolerated and which would result in
throwing the only guilt on the primordial cell or perhaps even on the
elementary gases  There is no question of how you came to be wicked but
only thisnamely are you wicked or not  This has been decided in the
affirmative neither can I hesitate for a single moment to say that it
has been decided justly  You are a bad and dangerous person and stand
branded in the eyes of your fellowcountrymen with one of the most
heinous known offences
It is not my business to justify the law the law may in some cases have
its inevitable hardships and I may feel regret at times that I have not
the option of passing a less severe sentence than I am compelled to do
But yours is no such case on the contrary had not the capital
punishment for consumption been abolished I should certainly inflict it
now
It is intolerable that an example of such terrible enormity should be
allowed to go at large unpunished  Your presence in the society of
respectable people would lead the less ablebodied to think more lightly
of all forms of illness neither can it be permitted that you should have
the chance of corrupting unborn beings who might hereafter pester you
The unborn must not be allowed to come near you and this not so much for
their protection for they are our natural enemies as for our own for
since they will not be utterly gainsaid it must be seen to that they
shall be quartered upon those who are least likely to corrupt them
But independently of this consideration and independently of the
physical guilt which attaches itself to a crime so great as yours there
is yet another reason why we should be unable to show you mercy even if
we are inclined to do so  I refer to the existence of a class of men who
lie hidden among us and who are called physicians  Were the severity of
the law or the current feeling of the country to be relaxed never so
slightly these abandoned persons who are now compelled to practise
secretly and who can be consulted only at the greatest risk would
become frequent visitors in every household their organisation and their
intimate acquaintance with all family secrets would give them a power
both social and political which nothing could resist  The head of the
household would become subordinate to the family doctor who would
interfere between man and wife between master and servant until the
doctors should be the only depositaries of power in the nation and have
all that we hold precious at their mercy  A time of universal
dephysicalisation would ensue medicinevendors of all kinds would abound
in our streets and advertise in all our newspapers  There is one remedy
for this and one only  It is that which the laws of this country have
long received and acted upon and consists in the sternest repression of
all diseases whatsoever as soon as their existence is made manifest to
the eye of the law  Would that that eye were far more piercing than it
is
But I will enlarge no further upon things that are themselves so
obvious  You may say that it is not your fault  The answer is ready
enough at hand and it amounts to thisthat if you had been born of
healthy and welltodo parents and been well taken care of when you were
a child you would never have offended against the laws of your country
nor found yourself in your present disgraceful position  If you tell me
that you had no hand in your parentage and education and that it is
therefore unjust to lay these things to your charge I answer that
whether your being in a consumption is your fault or no it is a fault in
you and it is my duty to see that against such faults as this the
commonwealth shall be protected  You may say that it is your misfortune
to be criminal I answer that it is your crime to be unfortunate
I do not hesitate therefore to sentence you to imprisonment with hard
labour for the rest of your miserable existence  During that period I
would earnestly entreat you to repent of these wrongs you have done
already and to entirely reform the constitution of your whole body  I
entertain but little hope that you will pay attention to my advice you
are already far too abandoned  Did it rest with myself I should add
nothing in mitigation of the sentence which I have passed but it is the
merciful provision of the law that even the most hardened criminal shall
be allowed some one of the three official remedies which is to be
prescribed at the time of his conviction  I shall therefore order that
you receive two tablespoonfuls of castoroil daily until the pleasure of
the court be further known
When the sentence was concluded the prisoner acknowledged in a few
scarcely audible words that he was justly punished and that he had had a
fair trial  He was then removed to the prison from which he was never to
return  There was a second attempt at applause when the judge had
finished speaking but as before it was at once repressed and though the
feeling of the court was strongly against the prisoner there was no show
of any violence against him if one may except a little hooting from the
bystanders when he was being removed in the prisoners van  Indeed
nothing struck me more during my whole sojourn in the country than the
general respect for law and order
MALCONTENTS  PART OF CHAPTER XII OF EREWHON
I write with great diffidence but it seems to me that there is no
unfairness in punishing people for their misfortunes or rewarding them
for their sheer good luck it is the normal condition of human life that
this should be done and no rightminded person will complain at being
subjected to the common treatment  There is no alternative open to us
It is idle to say that men are not responsible for their misfortunes
What is responsibility  Surely to be responsible means to be liable to
have to give an answer should it be demanded and all things which live
are responsible for their lives and actions should society see fit to
question them through the mouth of its authorised agent
What is the offence of a lamb that we should rear it and tend it and
lull it into security for the express purpose of killing it  Its
offence is the misfortune of being something which society wants to eat
and which cannot defend itself  This is ample  Who shall limit the
right of society except society itself  And what consideration for the
individual is tolerable unless society be the gainer thereby  Wherefore
should a man be so richly rewarded for having been son to a millionaire
were it not clearly provable that the common welfare is thus better
furthered  We cannot seriously detract from a mans merit in having been
the son of a rich father without imperilling our own tenure of things
which we do not wish to jeopardise if this were otherwise we should not
let him keep his money for a single hour we would have it ourselves at
once  For property is robbery but then we are all robbers or wouldbe
robbers together and have found it expedient to organise our thieving
as we have found it to organise our lust and our revenge  Property
marriage the law as the bed to the river so rule and convention to the
instinct
But to return  Even in England a man on board a ship with yellow fever
is held responsible for his mischance no matter what his being kept in
quarantine may cost him  He may catch the fever and die we cannot help
it he must take his chance as other people do but surely it would be
desperate unkindness to add contumely to our selfprotection unless
indeed we believe that contumely is one of our best means of
selfprotection  Again take the case of maniacs  We say that they are
irresponsible for their actions but we take good care or ought to take
good care that they shall answer to us for their insanity and we
imprison them in what we call an asylum that modern sanctuary if we do
not like their answers  This is a strange kind of irresponsibility  What
we ought to say is that we can afford to be satisfied with a less
satisfactory answer from a lunatic than from one who is not mad because
lunacy is less infectious than crime
We kill a serpent if we go in danger by it simply for being such and
such a serpent in such and such a place but we never say that the
serpent has only itself to blame for not having been a harmless creature
Its crime is that of being the thing which it is but this is a capital
offence and we are right in killing it out of the way unless we think
it more dangerous to do so than to let it escape nevertheless we pity
the creature even though we kill it
But in the case of him whose trial I have described above it was
impossible that any one in the court should not have known that it was
but by an accident of birth and circumstances that he was not himself
also in a consumption and yet none thought that it disgraced them to
hear the judge give vent to the most cruel truisms about him  The judge
himself was a kind and thoughtful person  He was a man of magnificent
and benign presence  He was evidently of an iron constitution and his
face wore an expression of the maturest wisdom and experience yet for
all this old and learned as he was he could not see things which one
would have thought would have been apparent even to a child  He could
not emancipate himself from nay it did not even occur to him to feel
the bondage of the ideas in which he had been born and bred  So was it
with the jury and bystanders andmost wonderful of allso was it even
with the prisoner  Throughout he seemed fully impressed with the notion
that he was being dealt with justly he saw nothing wanton in his being
told by the judge that he was to be punished not so much as a necessary
protection to society although this was not entirely lost sight of as
because he had not been better born and bred than he was  But this led
me to hope that he suffered less than he would have done if he had seen
the matter in the same light that I did  And after all justice is
relative
I may here mention that only a few years before my arrival in the
country the treatment of all convicted invalids had been much more
barbarous than now for no physical remedy was provided and prisoners
were put to the severest labour in all sorts of weather so that most of
them soon succumbed to the extreme hardships which they suffered this
was supposed to be beneficial in some ways inasmuch as it put the
country to less expense for the maintenance of its criminal class but
the growth of luxury had induced a relaxation of the old severity and a
sensitive age would no longer tolerate what appeared to be an excess of
rigour even towards the most guilty moreover it was found that juries
were less willing to convict and justice was often cheated because there
was no alternative between virtually condemning a man to death and
letting him go free it was also held that the country paid in
recommittals for its overseverity for those who had been imprisoned even
for trifling ailments were often permanently disabled by their
imprisonment and when a man has been once convicted it was probable he
would never afterwards be long off the hands of the country
These evils had long been apparent and recognised yet people were too
indolent and too indifferent to suffering not their own to bestir
themselves about putting an end to them until at last a benevolent
reformer devoted his whole life to effecting the necessary changes  He
divided illnesses into three classesthose affecting the head the
trunk and the lower limbsand obtained an enactment that all diseases
of the head whether internal or external should be treated with
laudanum those of the body with castoroil and those of the lower limbs
with an embrocation of strong sulphuric acid and water  It may be said
that the classification was not sufficiently careful and that the
remedies were ill chosen but it is a hard thing to initiate any reform
and it was necessary to familiarise the public mind with the principle
by inserting the thin end of the wedge first it is not therefore to be
wondered at that among so practical a people there should still be some
room for improvement  The mass of the nation are well pleased with
existing arrangements and believe that their treatment of criminals
leaves little or nothing to be desired but there is an energetic
minority who hold what are considered to be extreme opinions and who are
not at all disposed to rest contented until the principle lately admitted
has been carried further
THE MUSICAL BANKS  CHAPTER XIV OF EREWHON
On my return to the drawingroom I found the ladies were just putting
away their work and preparing to go out  I asked them where they were
going  They answered with a certain air of reserve that they were going
to the bank to get some money
Now I had already collected that the mercantile affairs of the
Erewhonians were conducted on a totally different system from our own I
had however gathered little hitherto except that they had two distinct
commercial systems of which the one appealed more strongly to the
imagination than anything to which we are accustomed in Europe inasmuch
as the banks conducted upon this system were decorated in the most
profuse fashion and all mercantile transactions were accompanied with
music so that they were called musical banks though the music was
hideous to a European ear
As for the system itself I never understood it neither can I do so now
they have a code in connection with it which I have no doubt they
themselves understand but no foreigner can hope to do so  One rule runs
into and against another as in a most complicated grammar or as in
Chinese pronunciation wherein I am told the slightest change in
accentuation or tone of voice alters the meaning of a whole sentence
Whatever is incoherent in my description must be referred to the fact of
