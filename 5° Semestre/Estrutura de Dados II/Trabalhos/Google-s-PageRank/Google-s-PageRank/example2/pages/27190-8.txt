Pussy Tales
Too Clever by Half
TELL us a story mother said the youngest kitten but three
Youve heard all my stories said the mother cat sleepily turning
over in the hay
Then make a new one said the youngest kitten so pertly that Mrs
Buff boxed her ears at oncebut she laughed too Did you ever hear a
cat laugh People say that cats often have occasion to do it
I do know one story she said but Im not sure that its true
though it was told me by a most respectable brindled gentleman a great
friend of my dear mothers He said he was a second cousin twentynine
times removed of Mrs Tabby White the lady the story is about
Oh do tell it said all the kittens sitting up very straight and
looking at their mother with green anxious eyes
Very well she said kindly only if you interrupt I shall leave off
So there was silence in the barn except for Mrs Buffs voice and the
soft sound of pleased purring which the kittens made as they listened to
the enchanting tale
Mrs Tabby White seems to have been as clever a cat as ever went
ratcatching in a pair of softsoled shoes She always knew just where a
mouse would peep out of the wainscot and she had her softsharp paw on
him before he had time to know that he was not alone in the room She
knew how to catch nice breakfasts for herself and her children a trick
I will teach you my dears when the spring comes she used to lie quite
quietly among the ivy on the wall and then take the baby birds out of
the nest when the grownup birds had gone to the grubshop Mrs Tabby
White was very clever as I saidso clever that presently she was not
satisfied with being at the very top of the cat profession
Catpeople have more sense than human people of course she said to
herself but still there are some things one might learn from them I
must watch and see how they do things
So next morning when the cook gave Mrs Tabby White her breakfast she
noticed that cook poured the milk out of a jug into a saucer That
afternoon Tabby felt thirsty but instead of putting her head into the
jug and drinking in the usual wayyou knowshe tilted up the jug to
pour the milk out as she had seen the cook do But cats paws though
they are so strong to catch rats and mice and birds are too weak to
hold big brown jugs The nasty deceitful jug fell off the dresser and
broke itself Just to spite me I do believe said Mrs Tabby And the
milk was all spilled
Now how on earth could that jug have been broken said cook when she
came in
It must have been the cat said the kitchenmaid and she was quite
right but nobody believed her
Then Mrs Tabby White noticed that human people slept in big
softcushioned white beds instead of sleeping on the kitchen
hearthrug or in the barn like cat people So she said to her children
one evening
My dears we are going to move into a new house
And the kittens were delighted and they all went upstairs very
quietly and crept into the very best human bed But unfortunately that
bed had been got ready for a human uncle to sleep in and when he found
the cats there he turned them out not gently and threw boots at them
till they fled pale with fright to the ends of their pretty tails And
next morning he told the Mistress of the house that horrid CATS had been
in his bed and he vowed that he would never pass another night under a
roof where such things were possible Mrs Tabby White was very
gladbecause no lady can wish for the visits of a person who throws
boots at her But the Mistress of the house said sadly Oh Tabbyyou
have lost us a fortune And Tabby for all her cleverness didnt
understand what the Mistress meant but went on purring proudly and
wondering what clever thing she could do next And I dont know what
it meant either so dont you interrupt with silly questions
I think we ought to wear shoes was the next thing Mrs Tabby White
said but all the human shoes were too big for her However there was a
nice pair of salmoncoloured kid shoes quite new belonging to the
human childs big dolland Mrs Tabby White put them on her eldest
kittens little browny feet
Now Brindle she said he was named after the gentleman who told me
the story you are grander than any kitten ever was before And at
first Brindle felt pleasedthen he tried to feel pleasedthen he knew
he wasnt pleased at all Then the shoes began to hurt him horribly so
he mewed sadly and Mrs Tabby White boxed his ears softlyas mother
cats do you know how I mean But when she was asleep he took off the
pink shoes and bit them to pieces And Nurse slapped him for it Poor
Mrs Tabby White was very miserable when she saw her son being slapped
for it is one thing to box your sons ears softly as mother cats do
you know how I mean and quite another to see another person do
itheavily as is the way with nursemaids
But the last and greatest effort Mrs Tabby White made to imitate human
manners was one Saturday night
She saw the human child have its bath before the nursery fire with hot
water pink soap dry towels and much fussing and she said to herself
Why should I waste hours every day in washing my children with my
little white paws and my little pink tongue when this human child can
be made clean in ten minutes with this big bath If I had more time I
could learn to be cleverer and I should end by being the most
wonderful Cat in all the world So she sat and watched and waited
When the human child was in bed and asleep Nurse went down to her
supper leaving the bath to be cleared away later for it was a hot
supper of baked onions and toasted cheese and if you dont go to that
supper directly it is ready you may as well not go at all for it wont
be worth eatingat least so I have heard the kitchenmaid say
Mrs Tabby White waited till she heard the last of Nurses steps on the
stairs below and then she put both her catchildren into the tub and
washed them with rosescented soap and a Turkey sponge At first they
thought it very good fun but presently the soap got in their eyes and
they were frightened of the sponge and they cried mewing piteously to
be taken out I dont know how she could have done it I couldnt
have treated a kitten of mine like that
When she took them out Mrs Tabby tried to dry them with the soft
towel but somehow catskin is not so easy to dry as childskin and the
little cats began to shiver and moan Oh mother we were so nice and
warm and now we are so cold Why is it What have we done Were we
naughty
Drat the cats said Nurse when she came up from supper and found
Mrs Tabby White trying to warm her kittens against her own comfortable
fur if they havent tumbled in the bath
Nurse dried the poor dear cruellyused kittens a little her hands
were bigger than Mrs Tabbys so she could do it better and put them
in a basket with flannel and next day TabbyKit was quite well though
rather ragged looking but Brindle had taken a chill and for days he
hung between life and death Poor Mrs Tabby was like a wild cat with
anxiety and when at last Brindle was well again or nearly for he
always had a slight cough after that Mrs Tabby White said to her
children My darlings I was wrong I was a silly old cat
No purred the catchildren darling mother you were always the
best of cats
Mrs Tabby kissed them both for of course any one would be pleased
that her children should think her the best of cats but in her heart
she knew well enough how silly she had been
Then she set about washing the kittens not with pink soap and white
towel this time but with white paws and pink tongue in the good
oldfashioned way
Thank you mother said all the kittens what a nice horrible story
What is the moral asked the youngest kitten but three
The moral said Mrs Buffy is There is such a thing as being too
clever by half Im not sure about the story being true but I know the
moral is Why its nearly teatime Come along children and get your
tea
So they all crept quietly away to catch the necessary mice and the
youngest was so afraid of being too clever by half that she would never
have caught a mouse at all if her mother had not boxed her
earssoftly as mother cats do you know how I mean
The White Persian
I WAS a handsome discreet middleaged respectable responsible
domesticated tabby cat I was humble I knew my place and kept it My
place was the place nearest the fire in winter or close to the sunny
window in summer There was nothing to trouble menot so much as a fly
in the cream or an error in the leaving of the cats meat until some
thoughtless person gave my master the white Persian cat
She was very beautiful in her soft foolish nambypamby blueeyed
way Of course she did not understand English and when they called
Puss puss she only ran under the sofa for she thought they were
teasing her She was mistress only of two languagesPersian and
cattalk
My master did not think of this He called her Puss he called her
Pussy he called her Tittums and Pussy then and a thousand
endearments that had formerly been lavished on me were vainly showered
on this unresponsive stranger But when he found she was cold to all of
them my master sighed
Poor thing he said she is deaf
I sat by the bright fender and washed my face and sleeked my pretty
paws and looked on My master gave up taking very much notice of the
new cat But I had a fear that he might learn Persian or cattalk and
make friends with her so I resolved that the best thing for me would be
a complete change in the Persians behavioursuch a change as should
make it impossible for her ever to be friends with him again so I said
to her
You wonder that our master looks coldly at you Perhaps you dont know
that in England a white cat is supposed to mew twenty times longer and
to purr twenty times louder than a cat of any other colour
Oh thank you so much for telling me she said gratefully I didnt
know As it happens I have a very good voice
And the next time she wanted her milk she mewed in a voice you could
have heard twenty miles away Poor master was so astonished that he
nearly dropped the saucer When she had finished the milk she jumped
upon his knee and he began to stroke her She nearly gave herself a
fit in her efforts to purr loud enough to please him At first he was
pleased but when the purring got louder and louder the poor man put
his hands to his ears and said Oh dear oh dear this is worse than a
whole hive of bees
Still he put her down gently and I congratulated her on having done so
well She did better She was an affectionate person though foolish
and in her anxiety to do what was expected of a cat of her colour in
England she practised day and night
Her purr was already the loudest I have heard from any cat but she
fancied she could improve her mewing and she mewed in the garden she
mewed in the house she mewed at meals she mewed at prayers she mewed
when she was hungry to show that she wanted food and she mewed when
she had had it to show her gratitude
Poor thing said the master to a friend who had come to see him she
is so deaf she cant hear the noise she makes
Of course I understood what he said but she hadnt yet picked up a
word of English and if the master had begun to learn Persian I dont
suppose he had got much beyond the alphabet
The Persians mew was rather feebler that day because she had a cold
I dont think its so bad said his friend If you really wanted to
get rid of her she is very handsome she would take a prize anywhere
She is yours said the master instantly and the strange gentleman
took her away in a basket
That evening it was I who sat on my masters kneeI who superintended
the writing of his letters on the greencovered writing tableI who
had all the milk that was left over from his tea
In a few days he had a letter I read it when he laid it down and if
you dont believe cats can read I can only say that it is just as easy
to read a letter like the masters as it is to write a story like this
The letter begged my master to take back the fair Persian
Her howls the letter went on become worse and worse The poor
creature is as you say too deaf to be tolerated
My master wrote back instantly to say that he would rather be condemned
to keep a dog than have the fair Persian within his doors again
Then by return of post came a pitiful letter begging for help and
mercy and the friend came again to tea I trembled lest my foreign
rival should come back to live with me But she didnt The next morning
my master took me on his knee and stroking me gently said
Ah Tabbykins no more Persians for us I have sent her to my deaf
aunt She will be delighted with hera most handsome presentand as
they are both deaf the fair Persians shrieks will hurt nobody
But I will have no more prize cats he said pouring out some cream
for me in his own saucer You know how to behave I will never have any
cat but you
I do and he never has
A Powerful Friend
MY mother was the best of cats She washed us kittens all over every
morning and at odd times during the day she would wash little bits of
us say an ear or a paw or a tailtip and she was very anxious about
our education I am afraid I gave her a great deal of trouble for I was
rather stout and heavy and did not take a very active or graceful part
in the exercises which she thought good for us
Our gymnasium was the kitchen hearthrug There was always a good fire
in the grate and it seemed to me so much better to go to sleep in
front of it than to run round after my own tail or even my mothers
though of course that was a great honour
As for running after the reel of cotton when the cook dropped it or
playing with the tassel of the blindcord or pretending that there were
mice inside the paper bag which I knew to be empty I confess that I had
no heart or imagination for these diversions
Of course you know best mother I used to say but it does seem to
me a dreadful waste of time We might be much better employed
How better employed asked my mother severely
Why I answered in eating or sleeping
At first my mother used to box my ears and insist on my learning such
little accomplishments as she thought necessary for my station in life
You see she would say all this playing with tails and reels and
balls of worsted is a preparation for the real business of life
What is that asked my sister
Mousecatching said my mother very earnestly
There are no mice here I said stretching myself
No but you will not always be here and if you practise the little
tricks I show you now with the ball of worsted and the tips of our
tails then when the great hour comes and a career is open to you and
you see before you the glorious prizethe MOUSEyou will be quick
enough and clever enough to satisfy the highest needs of your nature
And supposing we dont play with our tails and the balls of worsted I
said
Then said my mother bitterly you may as well lie down for the mice
to run over you
Thus at first she used to try to show me how foolish it was to think of
nothing but eating and sleeping but after a while she turned all her
attention to teaching my brother and sister and they were apt pupils
They despised nothing small enough to be moved by their paws which
could give them an opportunity of practising They did not mind making
themselves ridiculousa thing which has been always impossible with me
I have seen Tabby my sister in the garden playing with dead leaves
as excited and pleased as though they had been the birds which she
foolishly pretended that they were
I thought her very silly then but I lived to wish that I had taken half
as much trouble with my lessons as she did with hers My mother was very
pleased with her especially after she caught the starlings This was a
piece of cleverness which my sister invented and carried through
entirely out of her own head She made friends with one of the cows at
the farm near us and used to go into the cowhouse and jump on the cows
back Then when the cow was sent out into the field to get her grassy
breakfast my sister used to go with her riding on her back
Now birds are always very much on the lookout for cats and if they
can help it never allow one of us to come within halfadozen yards of
them without taking to those silly wings of theirs I never could see
why birds should have wingsso unnecessary
But birds are not afraid of cows for cows are very poor sportsmen and
never care to kill and eat anything
Now the back of a cow is the last place where you would think of looking
for a cat so when the starlings saw the cow coming they didnt think
it worth while to use their wings and when the cow was quite close to
the birdsbeautiful fat delightful birds my sister used to pick
out with her eye the fattest starling and then leap suddenly from the
cows back on to her prey She never missed
I have never known said my poor mother with tears of pride in her
green eyesI have never known a cat do anything so clever
Its all your doing mother dear said my sister prettily if you
hadnt taught me so well when I was little I should never have thought
of it And they kissed each other affectionately
I showed my claws and growled My mother shook her tabby head
O Buff she said if you had only been willing to learn when you were
little you might have been as clever as your sister instead of
being the great anxiety you are to me
And why am I an anxiety I said ruffling up my fur and my tail for I
was very angry
Because you are useless she said and not particularly handsome and
when a cat is useless and not particularly handsome they sometimes
What I said turning pale to the ends of my ears
They sometimes drown it Buff she said in a whisper and turned away
to hide her feelings
Judge of my own next day when they came into the kitchen and took me up
and put me into a basket I knew all about drowning These tales of
horror are told at twilight time in all cat nurseries and I knew that
if three large stones were put into the basket with me I might
consider my fate sealed
It was very uncomfortable in the basket They carried me upsidedown
part of the way and it was draughty and hard but so far there were
no stones When they took off the lid of the basket I found myself
under the shade of a huge moving mountain that seemed about to fall and
crush me It was an elephant
I found that the people where my mother lived had given me to the cook
who had given me to her cousin who was engaged to be married to a young
man whose brotherinlaw was the elephants keeper and so I found
myself in the elephants house
There was no milk for meno heads and tails of fishno scraps of
meatno delicious unforeseen morsels of butter
The elephant was very kind to me He had once had a friend exactly like
me he explained but had unfortunately walked upon him and now I had
come to fill the vacant place in his large heart
I resolved at once that he should not walk upon me but in order to
insure this I was compelled to enter upon a more active existence than
I had ever known
When I asked what I was expected to eat he said
Mice I suppose or you can have some of my buns if you like You might
like them at first but you will soon get tired of them
But I couldnt eat buns I was never from a kitten fond of such
things I got very hungry Again and again the mice rushed through the
straw and I heavily helplessly in my unpractised way rushed after
them At first the elephant laughed heartily at my inexpertness but
when he saw how hungry and wretched I was he said
They wont give you any milk and if they find you dont catch the mice
they will take you away from me Now you are a nice little cat and I
dont want to part with you We must try and arrange something
Then the great thought of my life came to me
You walked on the other cat I said
What he trumpeted in a voice of thunder
I beg your pardon I said hastily I didnt mean to hurt your
feelingsand indeed I could not have imagined that an elephant would
have been so thinskinned but a great idea has come to me Why
shouldnt you walk on micenot too hard but just so that I could eat
them afterwards
Well said the elephant showing his long tusks in a smile you are
not very handsome and you are not very brisk but you certainly have
brains my dear
He dropped his great foot as he spoke When he lifted it there lay a
mouse I had an excellent supper and before the weeks end I heard the
keeper say This cat has certainly done the trick She has kept the
mice down We must keep her
They have kept me They even go so far as to allow me to moisten my mice
with milk
There is no moral to this story except that you should do as you are
told and learn everything you can while you are young It is true that
I get on very well without having done so but then you may not have my
good luck It is not every cat who can get an elephant to catch her mice
for her
A Silly Question
HOW do you come to be white when all your brothers are tabby my
dear Dolly asked her kitten As she spoke she took it away from the
ball it was playing with and held it up and looked in its face as Alice
did with the Red Queen
Ill tell you if youll keep it a secret and not hold me so tight
the kitten answered
Dolly was not surprised to hear the kitten speak for she had read her
fairy books as all good children should and she knew that all
creatures answer if one only speaks to them properly So she held the
kitten more comfortably and the tale began
You must know my dear Dolly the kitten beganand Dolly thought it
dreadfully familiaryou must know that when we were very small we all
set out to seek our fortunes
Why interrupted Dolly you were all born and brought up in our barn
I used to see you every day
Quite so said the kitten we sought our fortune every night and it
turned out to be mice mostly Well one night I was seeking mine when
I came to a hole in the door that I had never noticed before I crept
through it and found myself in a beautiful large room It smelt
delicious There was cheese there and fish and cream and mice and
milk It was the most lovely room you can think of
Theres no such room began Dolly
Did I say there was asked the kitten I only said I found myself
there Well I stayed there some time It was the happiest hour of my
life But as I was washing my face after one of the most delicious
herrings heads you ever tasted I noticed that on nails all round the
room were hung skinsand they were cat skins it added slowly Well
may you tremble
Dolly hadnt trembled She had only shaken the kitten to make it speak
faster
Well I stood there rooted to the ground with horror and then came a
sort of horrible scramblerush and a barking and squeaking and a
terrible monster stood before me It was something like a dog and
something like a broom something like being thrown out of the larder by
cookI cant describe it It caught me up and in less than a moment
it had hung my tabby skin on a nail behind the door
I crept out of that lovely fairyland a cat without a skin And thats
how I came to be white
I dont quite see began Dolly
No Why what would your mother do if some one took off your dress and
hung it on a nail where she could not get it
Buy me another I suppose
Exactly But when my mother took me to the catskin shop they were
unfortunately quite out of tabby dresses in my size so I had to have a
white one
I dont believe a word of it said Dolly
No Well Im sure its as good a story as you could expect in answer
to such a silly question
But you were always
Oh well said the kitten showing its claws if you know more about
it than I do of course theres no more to be said Perhaps you could
tell me why your hair is brown
I was born so I believe said Dolly gently
The kitten put its nose in the air
Youve got no imagination it said
But Kitty really and truly without pretending you were born
white you know
If you know all about it why did you ask me At any rate you cant
expect me to remember whether I was born white or not I was too young
to notice such things
Now you are in fun said poor Dolly bewildered
The kitten bristled with indignation
What you really dont believe me Ill never speak to you again it
said And it never has
The Selfish Pussy
YES said the tortoiseshell cat to the grey one as she thoughtfully
washed her left ear I have lived in a great many families You see
its not every trade that deserves to have a cat about the place My
first master was a shoemaker and I lived with him happily enough until
one morning in winter when I found the wicked man sewing strips oflet
me whispercats fur on a pair of ladys slippers
I mewed as I saw it and he thinking I wanted milk put down his work
to get me some for he was fond enough of me I drank the milk and then
I ran away I could not live with such a man
My next home was in a garret with a halfstarved musician who made
violins A violin is a musical instrument that miauls when you touch it
just as we cats do and it was amusing to live with a man who could make
things with voices like my own He was very poor and often had not
enough to eat but he always got me my catsmeat and when there was no
fire on he nursed me to keep me warm But one day I learned from the
talk of one of his friends a man as lean as himself who came to see
him that the strings of the violins were taken from the bodies of dead
cats No wonder the voices were like my brothers voices since they
were stolen from my brothers bodies He might take my own voice some
day
So next day after the catsmeat man had called I walked quietly out
and never saw that bad violinmaker again
I was picked up in the street by a child who took me home to her
mothers house They were rich folk they had curtains and cushions
and couches and they did very little but nurse me or sometimes not
wishing to hurt his feelings the Italian greyhound But they liked me
best of course They were a noble family and I should have been living
with them still but one year when they went to the seaside they
forgot to provide for my board and lodging and I had to go into trade
again
Milk ahoy milk ahoy I heard that wellknown music as I sat lonely
on the doorstep of the deserted mansion in the Square The milkman
looked lonely too so I thought it would be only kind to go home with
him I did He was a very wellmeaning man but his tastes were low He
took skim milk in his tea and gave me the same Of course after that
I could not stay another hour under his roof
I tried two or three other houses and I could have been happy with a
very nice butcher who kept a corner shop but he kept a dog also a dog
that no cat in her senses would live in the same street with so I came
awayrather hurriedly I rememberand the dog saw me off Now I live
with a worker in silver and I have cream every day and when he makes a
creamjug and I remember what will be put in it some day I lick my
lips and think what a happy cat I am to live with such a good man
Where do you live
With a poor widow in an attic I never have enough to eat And
indeed the grey cat was thin
Why do you stay with her
Because I love her said the grey cat
Love replied the tortoiseshell cat
Nonsense I never heard of such a thing
Poor puss said the parrot in the window The grey cat thought it was
speaking to the tortoiseshell and the tortoiseshell was certain it
meant the grey Which do you think it meant
Meddlesome Pussy
I WAS separated from my mother at a very early age and sent out into
the world alone long before I had had time to learn to say please and
thank you and to shut the door after me and little things like that
One of the things I had not learned to understand was the difference
between milk in a saucer on the floor and milk in a jug on the table
Other cats tell me there is a difference but I cant see it The
difference is not in the taste of the milkthat is precisely the same
It is not so easy to get the milk out of a jug and I should have
thought some credit would attach to a cat who performed so clever a
