CHAPTER I
THE BLACKSMITHS BOY
Im going to the city
He stood in the wide door of the blacksmithshop with his hands in his
pockets looking down the street toward the rickety old bridge over
the Cocahutchie  He was a sandyhaired freckledfaced boy and if he
was really only about fifteen he was tall for his age  Across the top
of the door over his head stretched a cracked and faded sign with a
horseshoe painted on one end and a hammer on the other and the name
John Ogden almost faded out between them
The blacksmithshop was a great rusty grimy clutter of workbenches
vises tools iron in bars and rods and all sorts of old iron scraps
and things that looked as if they needed making over
The forge was in the middle on one side and near it was hitched a
horse pawing the ground with a hoof that bore a new shoe  On the
anvil was a brilliant yellowred loop of iron that was not quite yet
a new shoe and it was sending out bright sparks as a hammer fell upon
itthud thud thud and a clatter  Over the anvil leaned a tall
muscular darkhaired grimy man  His face wore a disturbed and
anxious look and it was covered with charcoal dust  There was
altogether too much charcoal along the high bridge of his Roman nose
and over his jutting eyebrows
The boy in the door also had some charcoal on his cheeks and forehead
but none upon his nose  His nose was not precisely like the
blacksmiths  It was high and Roman halfway down but just there was
a little dent and the rest of the nose was straight  His complexion
excepting the freckles and charcoal was chiefly sunburn down to the
neckband of his blue checked shirt  He was a tough wirylooking boy
and there was a kind of smiling selfconfident expression in his
bluegray eyes and around his firm mouth
Im going to the city he said again in a low but positive voice
Ill get there somehow
Just then a short thickset man came hurrying past him into the shop
He was probably the whitest man going into that or any other shop and
he spoke out at once very fast but with a voice that sounded as if it
came through a bag of meal
Ogden said he got him shod  If you have Ill take him  What do
you say about that trade
I dont want any more room than there is here said the blacksmith
and I dont care to move my shop
Theres nigh onto two acres mebbe more all along the creek from
below the mill to Deacon Hawkinss line below the bridge wheezed the
mealy floury dusty man rapidly  Ill get two hundred for it some
day ground or no ground  Best place for a shop
This lot suits me said the smith hammering away  Twouldnt pay
me to movenot in these times
The miller had more to say while he unhitched his horse but he led
him out without getting any more favorable reply about the trade
Come and blow Jack said the smith and the boy in the door turned
promptly to take the handle of the bellows
The little heap of charcoal and coke in the forge brightened and sent
up fiery tongues as the great leathern lungs wheezed and sighed and
Jack himself began to puff
Ive got to have a bigger man than you are for a blower and striker
said the smith  Hes coming Monday morning  Its time you were doing
something Jack
Why father said Jack as he ceased pulling on the bellows and the
shoe came out of the fire Ive been doing something ever since I was
twelve  Been working here since May and lots o times before that
Learned the trade too
You can make a nail but you cant make a shoe said his father as
he sizzed the bit of bent iron in the watertub and then threw it on
the ground  Seven  Thats all the shoes Ill make this morning and
there are seven of you at home  Your mother cant spare Molly but
youll have to do something  It is Saturday and you can go fishing
after dinner if youd like to  Theres nothin to ketch round here
either  Worst times there ever were in Crofield
There was gloom as well as charcoal on the face of the blacksmith but
Jacks expression was only respectfully serious as he walked away
without speaking and again stood in the door for a moment
I could catch something in the city  I know I could he said to
himself  How on earth shall I get there
The bridge at the lower end of the sloping sidestreet on which the
shop stood was long and high  It was made to fit the road and was a
number of sizes too large for the stream of water rippling under it
The sidestreet climbed about twenty rods the other way into what was
evidently the Main Street of Crofield  There was a tavern on one
corner and across the street from that there was a drug store and in
it was the postoffice  On the two opposite corners were shops and
all along Main Street were all sorts of business establishments
sandwiched in among the dwellings
It was not yet noon but Crofield had a sleepy look as if all its work
for the whole week were done  Even the horses of the farmers teams
hitched in front of the stores looked sleepy  Jack Ogden took his
longest look this time at a neat whitepainted framehouse across
the way
Seems to me there isnt nearly so much room in it as there used to
be he said to himself  Its just packed and crowded  Im going
He turned and walked on up toward Main Street as if that were the best
thing he could do till dinner time  Not many minutes later a girl
plainly but neatly dressed came slowly along in front of the village
green away up Main Street  She was tall and slender and her hair and
eyes were as dark as those of John Ogden the blacksmith  Her nose was
like his too except that it was finer and not so high and she wore
very much the same anxious discontented look upon her face  She was
walking slowly because she saw coming toward her a portly lady with
hair so flaxy that no gray would show in it  She was elegantly
dressed  She stopped and smiled and looked very condescending
Goodmorning Mary Ogden she said
Goodmorning Miss Glidden said Mary the anxious look in her eyes
changing to a gleam that made them seem very wide awake
Its a fine morning Mary Ogden but so very warm  Is your mother
well
Very well thank you said Mary
And is your aunt welland your father and all the children  Im so
glad they are well  Elder Holloways to be here tomorrow  Hope
youll all come  I shall be there myself  Youve had my class a
number of times  Much obliged to you  Ill be there tomorrow  You
must hear the Elder  Hes to inspect the Sundayschool
Your class Miss Glidden began Mary and her face suggested that
somebody was blowing upon a kind of fire inside her cheeks and that
they would be very red in a minute
Yes dont fail to be there tomorrow Mary  The choirll be full of
course  I shall be there myself
I hope you will Miss Glidden
The portly lady saw something up the street at that moment
Oh my  What is it  Dear me  Its coming  Run  Well all be
killed  Oh my
She had turned quite around while she was speaking and was once more
looking up the street but the darkhaired girl had neither flinched
nor wavered  She had only sent a curious inquiring glance in the
direction of the shouts and the rattle and the cloud of dust that were
coming swiftly toward them
A runaway team she said quietly  Nobodys in the wagon
Dear me exclaimed Miss Glidden but Mary began to move away looking
not at her but at the runaway and she did not hear the rest  Mary
Ogdens too uppishSomebodyll be killed I know they willShes
got to be taken downThere they comeDressed too well for a
blacksmiths daughter  Doesnt know her placeOh dear  Im so
frightened
Perhaps she had been wise in getting behind the nearest tree  It was a
young maple two inches through lately set out but it might have
stopped a pair of very small horses  Those in the road were
largealmost too large to run well  They were wellmatched grays and
they came thundering along in a way that was really fine to behold
heads down necks arched nostrils wide reins flying the wagon behind
them banging and swervingno wonder everybody stood still and except
Mary Ogden shouted Stop em  One young fellow across the street
stood still only until the runaways were all but close by him  Then he
darted out into the street not ahead of them but behind them  No man
on earth could have stopped those horses by standing in front of them
They could have charged through a regiment  Their heavy furious
gallop was fast too and the boy who was now following them must have
been as light of foot as a young deer
Hurrah  Hurrah  Go it Jack  Catch em  Bully for you arose from
a score of people along the sidewalk as he bounded forward
Its Jack  Oh dear me  But its just like him  There  Hes in
exclaimed Mary Ogden her dark eyes dancing proudly
Why its that goodfornothing brother of Mary Ogden  Hes the
blacksmiths boy  Im afraid he will be hurt remarked Miss Glidden
kindly and benevolently but all the rest shouted Hurrah again
Fierce was the strain upon the young runner for a moment and then his
hands were on the backboard of the bouncing wagon  A tug a spring a
swerve of the wagon and Jack Ogden was in it and in a second more the
loosely flying reins were in his hands
The strong arms of his father were they twice as strong could not at
once have pulled in those horses and one man on the sidewalk seemed to
be entirely correct when he said Hes a plucky little fellow but he
cant do a thing now hes there
Illustration The Runaway
His sister was trembling all over but she was repeating He did it
splendidly  He can do anything
Jack in the wagon was thinking only I know em  Theyre old
Hammonds team  Theyll try to go home to the mill  Theyll smash
everything if I dont look out
It is something even to a greatly frightened horse to feel a hand on
the rein  The team intended to turn out of Main Street at the corner
and they made the turn but they did not crash the wagon to pieces
against the corner post because of the desperate guiding that was done
by Jack  The wagon swung around without upsetting  It tilted
fearfully and the nigh wheel was in the air for a moment until Jacks
weight helped bring it down again  There was a short sharp scream
across the street when the wagon swung and the wheel went up
Down the slope toward the bridge thundered the galloping team and the
blacksmith ran out of his shop to see it pass
Turn them into the creek Jack he shouted but there was no time for
any answer
Theyd smash through the bridge thought Jack  I know what Im
about
There were wheelmarks down from the street at the left of the bridge
where many a team had descended to drink the water of the Cocahutchie
but it required all Jacks strength on one rein to make his runaways
take that direction  They had thought of going toward the mill but
they knew the wateringplace
Not many rods below the bridge stood a clump of half a dozen gigantic
trees remnants of the old forest which had been replaced by the
streets of Crofield and the farms around it  Jacks pull on the left
rein was obeyed only too well and it looked for some seconds as if
the plunging beasts were about to wind up their maddened dash by a
wreck among those gnarled trunks and projecting roots  Jack drew his
breath hard and there was almost a chill at his young heart but he
held hard and said nothing
Forwardone plunge morehard on the right rein
That was close he said  If we didnt go right between the big
maple and the cherry  Now Ive got em
Splash crash rattle  Spattering and plunging but cooling fast the
gray team galloped along the shallow bed of the Cocahutchie
I wish the old swimminghole was deeper said Jack but the waters
very low  Whoa boys  Whoa there  Almost up to the hubover the
hub  Whoa now
And the gray team ceased its plunging and stood still in water three
feet deep
I mustnt let em drink too much said Jack but a little wont hurt
em
The horses were trembling all over but one after the other they put
their noses into the water and then raised their heads to prick their
ears back and forth and look round
Dont bring em ashore till theyre quiet Jack called out the deep
ringing voice of his father from the bank
There he stood and other men were coming on the run  The tall
blacksmiths black eyes were flashing with pride over the daring feat
his son had performed
I darent tell him though he said to himself  Hes set up enough
aready  He thinks he can do most anything
Jack wheezed a mealy voice at his side thats my team
I know it said Jack  They re all right now  Pretty close shave
through the trees that was
I owe ye fifty dollars for asavin them and the wagin said the
miller  Its wuth it and Ill pay it but Ive got to owe it to ye
jest now  Times are awful hard in Crofield  If Id ha lost them
hosses and that wagin
He stopped short as if he could not exactly say how disastrous it
would have been for him
There was a running fire of praise and of questions poured at Jack by
the gathering knot of people on the shore and it was several minutes
before his father spoke again
Theyre cool now he said  Turn em Jack and walk em out by the
bridge and up to the mill  Then come home to dinner
Jack pretended not to see quite a different kind of group gathered
under the clump of tall trees  Not a voice had come to him from that
group of lookerson and yet the fact that they were there made him
tingle all over
Two large frecklefaced sandyhaired women were hugging each other
and wiping their eyes and a very small girl was tugging at their
dresses and crying while a pair of girls of from twelve to fourteen
close by them seemed very much inclined to dance  Two small boys who
at first belonged to the party had quickly rolled up their trousers
and waded out as far as they could into the Cocahutchie  Just in front
of the group under the trees stood Mary Ogden straight as an arrow
her dark eyes flashing and her cheeks glowing while she looked silently
at the boy on the wagon in the stream until she saw him wheel the
grays  Even then she did not say anything but turned and walked away
It was as if she had so much to say that she felt she could not say it
Aunt Melinda  Mother said one of the girls Jack isnt hurt a
mite  Theyd all ha been drowned though if there was water enough
Hush Bessie said one of the large women and the other at once
echoed Hush Bessie
They were very nearly alike these women and they both had long
straight noses such as Jacks would have been if halfway down it had
not been Roman like his fathers
Mary Ann said the first woman we mustnt say too much to him about
it  He can only just be held in now
Hush Melinda said Jacks mother  I thought Id seen the last of
him when the gray critters came apowderin down the road past the
houseand then she wiped her eyes again and so did Aunt Melinda and
they both stooped down at the same moment saying Jacks safe
Sally and picked up the small girl who was crying and kissed her
The gray team was surrendered to its owner as soon as it reached the
road at the foot of the bridge and again Jack was loudly praised by
the miller  The rest of the Ogden family seemed to be disposed to keep
away but the tall blacksmith himself was there
Jack said he as they turned away homeward you can go fishing this
afternoon just as I said  I was thinking of your doing something else
afterward but youve done about enough for one day
He had more to say concerning what would have happened to the millers
horses and the number of pieces the wagon would have been knocked
into but for the manner in which the whole team had been saved
When they reached the house the front door was open but nobody was to
be seen  Bob and Jim the two small boys had not yet returned from
seeing the gray span taken to the mill and the women and girls had
gone through to the kitchen
Jack said his father as they went in old Hammondll owe you that
fifty dollars long enough  He never really pays anything
Course he doesntnot if he can help it said Jack  I worked for
him three months and you know we had to take it out in feed  I
learned the mill trade though and that was something
Just then he was suddenly embarrassed  Mrs Ogden had gone through the
house and out at the back door and Aunt Melinda had followed her and
so had the girls  Molly had suddenly gone upstairs to her own room
Aunt Melinda had taken everything off the kitchen stove and put
everything back again and here now was Mrs Ogden back again hugging
her son
Jack she said dont you ever ever do such a thing again  You
might ha been knocked into slivers
Molly had gone up the back stairs only to come down the front way and
she was now a little behind them
Mother she exclaimed as if her pentup admiration for her brother
was exploding you ought to have seen him jump in and you ought to
have seen that wagon go around the corner
Jack broke in the halfchoked voice of Aunt Melinda from the kitchen
doorway come and eat something  I felt as if I knew you were killed
sure  If you havent earned your dinner nobody has
Why I know how to drive said Jack  I wasnt afraid of em after I
got hold of the reins
He seemed even in a hurry to get through his dinner and some minutes
later he was out in the garden digging for bait  The rest of the
family remained at the table longer than usual especially Bob and Jim
but for some reason known to herself Mary did not say a word about
her meeting with Miss Glidden  Perhaps the millers gray team had run
away with all her interest in that but she did not even tell how
carefully Miss Glidden had inquired after the family
There goes Jack she said at last and they all turned to look
He did not say anything as he passed the kitchen door but he had his
long cane fishingpole over his shoulder  It had a line wound around
it ready for use  He went out of the gate and down the road toward
the bridge and gave only a glance across at the shop
I didnt get many worms he said to himself at the bridge but I
can dig some more if the fish bite  Sometimes they do and sometimes
they dont
Over the bridge he went and up a wagon track on the opposite bank but
he paused for one moment in the very middle of the bridge to look up
stream
Theres just enough water to run the mill he said  There isnt any
coming over the dam  The ponds even full though and it may be a
good day for fish  I wish I was in the city
CHAPTER II
THE FISH WERE THERE
Saturday afternoon was before Jack Ogden when he came out at the
waters edge near the dam across from the mill  That was there big
and red and rustylooking and the dam was there and above them was
the millpond spreading out over a number of acres and ornamented
with stumps old logs pondlilies and weeds  It was a fairly good
pond the best that Cocahutchie Creek could do for Crofield but Jacks
face fell a little as he looked at it
There are more fellows than fish here he said to himself with an
air of disgust
There was a boy at the end of the dam near him and a boy in the middle
of it and two boys at the flume near the mill  There were three
punts out on the water and one of them had in it a man and two boys
while the second boat held but one man and the third contained four
A big stump near the north shore supported a boy and the old snag
jutting out from the south shore held a boy and a man
There they all were sitting perfectly still until one after another
each rod and line came up to have its hook and bait examined to see
whether or not there had really been a bite
Im fairly crowded out remarked Jack  Those fellows have all the
good places  Ill have to go somewhere else wherell I go
He studied that problem for a full minute while every fisherman there
turned to look at him and then turned back to watch his line
I guess Ill try down stream said Jack  Nobody ever caught
anything down there and nobody ever goes there but I spose I might
as well try it just for once
He turned away along the track over which he had come  He did not
pause at the road and bridge but went on down the further bank of the
Cocahutchie  It was a pretty stream of water and it spread out wide
and shallow and rippled merrily among stones and bowlders and clumps
of willow and alder for nearly half a mile  Gradually then it grew
narrower quieter deeper and wore a sleepy look which made it seem
more in keeping with quiet old Crofield
The hays about ready to cut said Jack as he plodded along the
path near the waters edge through a thriving meadow of clover and
timothy  Theres always plenty of work in haying time  Hullo  What
grasshoppers  Jingo
As he made the last exclamation he clapped his hand upon his trousers
pocket
If I didnt forget to go in and get my sinker  Never did such a thing
before in all my life  Whats the use of trying to fish without a
sinker
The luck seemed to be going directly against him  Even the
Cocahutchie at his left had dwindled to a mere crack between bushes
and high grass as if to show that it had no room to let for fish to
live inthat is for fish accustomed to having plenty of room such as
they could find when living in a millpond lined around the edges with
boys and fishpoles
Thats a whopper suddenly exclaimed Jack with a quick snatch at
something that alighted upon his left arm  Ive caught him
Grasshoppers are the best kind of bait too  Ill try him on sinker
or no sinker  Hope there are some fish down here
The line he unwound from his rod was somewhat coarse but it was
strong and so was his hook as if the fishing around Crofield called
for stout tackle as well as for a large number of sportsmen  The big
longlimbed greencoated jumper was placed in position on the hook
and then with several more grumbling regrets over the absence of any
sinker Jack searched along the bank for a place whence he could throw
his bait into the water
Thisll do he said at last and the breeze helped him to swing out
his line until the grasshopper at the end of it dropped lightly and
naturally into a dark little eddy almost across that narrow ribbon of
the Cocahutchie
Splashtugsplash again
Jingo  Whats that  I declareif he isnt pulling  Hell break the
lineno he wont  See that pole bend  Steadyhere he comes
Hurrah
Out he came indeed for the rude strong tackle held even against the
game struggling of that vigorous trout  There he lay now on the
grass with Jack Ogden bending over him in a fever of exultation and
amazement
I never could have caught him with a worm and a sinker he said
aloud  This is the way to catch em  Isnt he a big fellow  Ill
try some more grasshoppers
There was not likely to be another twopound brooktrout very near the
hole out of which that one had been pulled  There would not have been
any at all perhaps but for the prevailing superstition that there
were no fish there  Everybody knew that there were bullheads suckers
perch and pumpkinseeds in the millpond and eels with now and
then a pickerel but the trout were a profound secret  It was easy to
catch another big grasshopper but the young sportsman knew very well
that he knew nothing at all of that kind of fishing  He had made his
first cast perfectly because it was about the only way in which it
could have been made and now he was so very nervous and excited and
cautious that he did very well again aided as before by the breeze
Not in the same place but at a little distance down and close to
where Jack captured his second bait there was a crook in the
Cocahutchie with a steep overhanging bushy bank  Into the glassy
shadow under that bank the sinkerless line carried and dropped its
little green prisoner and there was a hungry fellow in there waiting
for foolish grasshoppers in the meadow to spring too far and come down
upon the water instead of upon the grass  As the grasshopper alighted
on the water there was a rush a plunge a strong hard pull and then
Jack Ogden said to himself
Ive heard how they do it  They wait and tire em out  I wont be in
too much of a hurry  Hell get away if I am
That is probably what the fish would have done for he was a fish with
what army men call tactics  He was able to pull very hard and he
was also wise enough to rush in under the bank and to sulkily stay
there
Feels as if Id hooked a snag said Jack  May be Ive lost the fish
and hes hitched me into a codlamper eel of some kind  Steadyno
I mustnt pull harder than the fish
He was breathless but not with any exertion that he was making  His
hat fell off upon the grass as he leaned forward through the alder
bushes and his sandy hair was tangled for a moment in some stubby
twigs  He loosened his head still holding firmly his bent and
straining rod  One step farther a slip of his left foot an
unsuccessful grasp at a bush and then Jack went over and down into a
pool deeper than he had thought the Cocahutchie afforded so near
Crofield
There was a very fine splash as the grasshopper flyfisherman went
under and there was a coughing and spluttering a moment afterward
when his eager excited anxious face came up again  He could swim
extremely well and he was not thinking of his duckingonly of his
game
I hope I havent lost him he exclaimed as he tried to pull upon the
line
It did not tug at all just then for the fish on the hook had been
rudely startled out from under the bank and was on his way up the
Cocahutchie with the hook in his mouth
There he is  Ive got him yet  Glad I can swim cried Jack and
it did seem as if he and this fish were very well matched except that
Jack had to give one of his hands to the rod while his captive could
use every fin
Down stream floated Jack passing the rod back through his hands until
he could grasp the line and all the while the fish was darting madly
about to get away
There Ive touched bottom  Now for him  Here he comes  Ill draw
him ashore easythats it  Hurrah biggest fish ever was caught in
the Cocahutchie
That might or might not be so but Jack Ogden had a threepound trout
flopping angrily upon the grass at his feet
I know how to do it now he almost shouted  I can catch em  I
wont let anybody else know how its done either
He had learned something no doubt but he had not learned how to make
a large fish out of a small one  All the rest of that afternoon he
caught grasshoppers and cast them daintily into what seemed to be good
places but he did not have another occasion to tumble in  When at
last he was tired out and decided to go home he had a dozen more of
trout not one of them weighing over six ounces with a pair of very
