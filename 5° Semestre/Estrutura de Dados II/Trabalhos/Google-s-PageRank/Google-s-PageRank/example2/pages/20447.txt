INTERVIEWS
THE BIBLE AND A FUTURE LIFE
Question  Colonel are your views of religion based upon the
Bible
Answer  I regard the Bible especially the Old Testament the
same as I do most other ancient books in which there is some truth
a great deal of error considerable barbarism and a most plentiful
lack of good sense
Question  Have you found any other work sacred or profane
which you regard as more reliable
Answer  I know of no book less so in my judgment
Question  You have studied the Bible attentively have you not
Answer  I have read the Bible  I have heard it talked about a
good deal and am sufficiently well acquainted with it to justify
my own mind in utterly rejecting all claims made for its divine
origin
Question  What do you base your views upon
Answer  On reason observation experience upon the discoveries
in science upon observed facts and the analogies properly growing
out of such facts  I have no confidence in anything pretending to
be outside or independent of or in any manner above nature
Question  According to your views what disposition is made of
man after death
Answer  Upon that subject I know nothing  It is no more wonderful
that man should live again than he now lives upon that question
I know of no evidence  The doctrine of immortality rests upon
human affection  We love therefore we wish to live
Question  Then you would not undertake to say what becomes of
man after death
Answer  If I told or pretended to know what becomes of man after
death I would be as dogmatic as are theologians upon this question
The difference between them and me is I am honest  I admit that
I do not know
Question  Judging by your criticism of mankind Colonel in your
recent lecture you have not found his condition very satisfactory
Answer  Nature outside of man so far as I know is neither
cruel nor merciful  I am not satisfied with the present condition
of the human race nor with the condition of man during any period
of which we have any knowledge  I believe however the condition
of man is improved and this improvement is due to his own exertions
I do not make nature a being  I do not ascribe to nature
intentions
Question  Is your theory Colonel the result of investigation
of the subject
Answer  No one can control his own opinion or his own belief
My belief was forced upon me by my surroundings  I am the product
of all circumstances that have in any way touched me  I believe
in this world  I have no confidence in any religion promising joys
in another world at the expense of liberty and happiness in this
At the same time I wish to give others all the rights I claim for
myself
Question  If I asked for proofs for your theory what would you
furnish
Answer  The experience of every man who is honest with himself
every fact that has been discovered in nature  In addition to
these the utter and total failure of all religionists in all
countries to produce one particle of evidence showing the existence
of any supernatural power whatever and the further fact that the
people are not satisfied with their religion  They are continually
asking for evidence  They are asking it in every imaginable way
The sects are continually dividing  There is no real religious
serenity in the world  All religions are opponents of intellectual
liberty  I believe in absolute mental freedom  Real religion with
me is a thing not of the head but of the heart not a theory not
a creed but a life
Question  What punishment then is inflicted upon man for his
crimes and wrongs committed in this life
Answer  There is no such thing as intellectual crime  No man
can commit a mental crime  To become a crime it must go beyond
thought
Question  What punishment is there for physical crime
Answer  Such punishment as is necessary to protect society and
for the reformation of the criminal
Question  If there is only punishment in this world will not
some escape punishment
Answer  I admit that all do not seem to be punished as they
deserve  I also admit that all do not seem to be rewarded as they
deserve and there is in this world apparently as great failures
in matter of reward as in matter of punishment  If there is another
life a man will be happier there for acting according to his
highest ideal in this  But I do not discern in nature any effort
to do justice
The Post Washington D C 1878
MRS VAN COTT THE REVIVALIST
Question  I see Colonel that in an interview published this
morning Mrs Van Cott the revivalist calls you a poor barking
dog  Do you know her personally
Answer  I have never met or seen her
Question  Do you know the reason she applied the epithet
Answer  I suppose it to be the natural result of what is called
vital piety that is to say universal love breeds individual
hatred
Question  Do you intend making any reply to what she says
Answer  I have written her a note of which this is a copy
Buffalo Feb 24th 1878
MRS VAN COTT
My dear MadamWere you constrained by the love of Christ to call
a man who has never injured you a poor barking dog  Did you make
this remark as a Christian or as a lady  Did you say these words
to illustrate in some faint degree the refining influence upon
women of the religion you preach
What would you think of me if I should retort using your language
changing only the sex of the last word
I have the honor to remain
Yours truly
R G INGERSOLL
Question  Well what do you think of the religious revival system
generally
Answer  The fire that has to be blown all the time is a poor
thing to get warm by  I regard these revivals as essentially
barbaric  I think they do no good but much harm they make innocent
people think they are guilty and very mean people think they are
good
Question  What is your opinion concerning women as conductors
of these revivals
Answer  I suppose those engaged in them think they are doing
good  They are probably honest  I think however that neither
men nor women should be engaged in frightening people into heaven
That is all I wish to say on the subject as I do not think it
worth talking about
The Express Buffalo New York Feb 1878
EUROPEAN TRIP AND GREENBACK QUESTION
Question  What did you do on your European trip Colonel
Answer  I went with my family from New York to Southampton
England thence to London and from London to Edinburgh  In Scotland
I visited every place where Burns had lived from the cottage where
he was born to the room where he died  I followed him from the
cradle to the coffin  I went to StratforduponAvon for the purpose
of seeing all that I could in any way connected with Shakespeare
next to London where we visited again all the places of interest
and thence to Paris where we spent a couple of weeks in the
Exposition
Question  And what did you think of it
Answer  So far as machineryso far as the practical is concerned
it is not equal to ours in Philadelphia in art it is incomparably
beyond it  I was very much gratified to find so much evidence in
favor of my theory that the golden age in art is in front of us
that mankind has been advancing that we did not come from a perfect
pair and immediately commence to degenerate  The modern painters
and sculptors are far better and grander than the ancient  I think
we excel in fine arts as much as we do in agricultural implements
Nothing pleased me more than the painting from Holland because
they idealized and rendered holy the ordinary avocations of life
They paint cottages with sweet mothers and children they paint
homes  They are not much on Ariadnes and Venuses but they paint
good women
Question  What did you think of the American display
Answer  Our part of the Exposition is good but nothing to what
is should and might have been but we bring home nearly as many
medals as we took things  We lead the world in machinery and in
ingenious inventions and some of our paintings were excellent
Question  Colonel crossing the Atlantic back to America what
do you think of the Greenback movement
Answer  In regard to the Greenback party in the first place
I am not a believer in miracles  I do not believe that something
can be made out of nothing  The Government in my judgment cannot
create money the Government can give its note like an individual
and the prospect of its being paid determines its value  We have
already substantially resumed  Every piece of property that has
been shrinking has simply been resuming  We expended during the
warnot for the useful but for the useless not to build up but
to destroyat least one thousand million dollars  The Government
was an enormous purchaser when the war ceased the industries of
the country lost their greatest customer  As a consequence there
was a surplus of production and consequently a surplus of labor
At last we have gotten back and the country since the war has
produced over and above the cost of production something near the
amount that was lost during the war  Our exports are about two
hundred million dollars more than our imports and this is a healthy
sign  There are however five or six hundred thousand men
probably out of employment as prosperity increases this number
will decrease  I am in favor of the Government doing something to
ameliorate the condition of these men  I would like to see
constructed the Northern and Southern Pacific railroads this would
give employment at once to many thousands and homes after awhile
to millions  All the signs of the times to me are good  The
wretched bankrupt law at last is wiped from the statute books
and honest people in a short time can get plenty of credit  This
law should have been repealed years before it was  It would have
been far better to have had all who have gone into bankruptcy during
these frightful years to have done so at once
Question  What will be the political effect of the Greenback
movement
Answer  The effect in Maine has been to defeat the Republican
party  I do not believe any party can permanently succeed in the
United States that does not believe in and advocate actual money
I want to see the greenback equal with gold the world round  A
money below par keeps the people below par  No man can possibly
be proud of a country that is not willing to pay its debts  Several
of the States this fall may be carried by the Greenback party but
if I have a correct understanding of their views that party cannot
hold any State for any great length of time  But all the men of
wealth should remember that everybody in the community has got in
some way to be supported  I want to see them so that they can
support themselves by their own labor  In my judgment real prosperity
will begin with actual resumption because confidence will then
return  If the workingmen of the United States cannot make their
living cannot have the opportunity to labor they have got to be
supported in some way and in any event I want to see a liberal
policy inaugurated by the Government  I believe in improving rivers
and harbors
I do not believe the transcontinental commerce of this country
should depend on one railroad  I want new territories opened  I
want to see American steamships running to all the great ports of
the world  I want to see our flag flying on all the seas and in
all the harbors  We have the best country and in my judgment
the best people in the world and we ought to be the most prosperous
nation on the earth
Question  Then you only consider the Greenback movement a
temporary thing
Answer  Yes I do not believe that there is anything permanent
in anything that is not sound that has not a perfectly sound
foundation and I mean sound sound in every sense of that word
It must be wise and honest  We have plenty of money the trouble
is to get it  If the Greenbackers will pass a law furnishing all
of us with collaterals there certainly would be no trouble about
getting the money  Nothing can demonstrate more fully the
plentifulness of money than the fact that millions of four per
cent bonds have been taken in the United States  The trouble is
business is scarce
Question  But do you not think the Greenback movement will help
the Democracy to success in 1880
Answer  I think the Greenback movement will injure the Republican
party much more than the Democratic party  Whether that injury
will reach as far as 1880 depends simply upon one thing  If
resumptionin spite of all the resolutions to the contrary
inaugurates an era of prosperity as I believe and hope it will
then it seems to me that the Republican party will be as strong in
the North as in its palmiest days  Of course I regard most of the
old issues as settled and I make this statement simply because I
regard the financial issue as the only living one
Of course I have no idea who will be the Democratic candidate
but I suppose the South will be solid for the Democratic nominee
unless the financial question divides that section of the country
Question  With a solid South do you not think the Democratic
nominee will stand a good chance
Answer  Certainly he will stand the best chance if the Democracy
is right on the financial question if it will cling to its old
idea of hard money he will  If the Democrats will recognize that
the issues of the war are settled then I think that party has the
best chance
Question  But if it clings to soft money
Answer  Then I think it will be beaten if by soft money it
means the payment of one promise with another
Question  You consider Greenbackers inflationists do you not
Answer  I suppose the Greenbackers to be the party of inflation
I am in favor of inflation produced by industry  I am in favor of
the country being inflated with corn with wheat good houses
books pictures and plenty of labor for everybody  I am in favor
of being inflated with gold and silver but I do not believe in
the inflation of promise expectation and speculation  I sympathize
with every man who is willing to work and cannot get it and I
sympathize to that degree that I would like to see the fortunate
and prosperous taxed to support his unfortunate brother until labor
could be found
The Greenback party seems to think credit is just as good as gold
While the credit lasts this is so but the trouble is whenever it
is ascertained that the gold is gone or cannot be produced the
credit takes wings  The bill of a perfectly solvent bank may
circulate for years  Now because nobody demands the gold on that
bill it doesnt follow that the bill would be just as good without
any gold behind it  The idea that you can have the gold whenever
you present the bill gives it its value  To illustrate  A poor
man buys soup tickets  He is not hungry at the time of purchase
and will not be for some hours  During those hours the Greenback
gentlemen argue that there is no use of keeping any soup on hand
with which to redeem these tickets and from this they further
argue that if they can be good for a few hours without soup why
not forever  And they would be only the holder gets hungry
Until he is hungry of course he does not care whether any soup
is on hand or not but when he presents his ticket he wants his
soup and the idea that he can have the soup when he does present
the ticket gives it its value  And so I regard bank notes without
gold and silver as of the same value as tickets without soup
The Post Washington D C 1878
THE PREMILLENNIAL CONFERENCE
Question  What do you think of the PreMillennial Conference
that was held in New York City recently
Answer  Well I think that all who attended it were believers
in the Bible and any one who believes in prophecies and looks to
their fulfillment will go insane  A man that tries from Daniels
ram with three horns and five tails and his deformed goats to
ascertain the date of the second immigration of Christ to this
world is already insane  It all shows that the moment we leave
the realm of fact and law we are adrift on the wide and shoreless
sea of theological speculation
Question  Do you think there will be a second coming
Answer  No not as long as the church is in power  Christ will
never again visit this earth until the Freethinkers have control
He will certainly never allow another church to get hold of him
The very persons who met in New York to fix the date of his coming
would despise him and the feeling would probably be mutual  In
his day Christ was an Infidel and made himself unpopular by
denouncing the church as it then existed  He called them liars
hypocrites thieves vipers whited sepulchres and fools  From
the description given of the church in that day I am afraid that
should he come again he would be provoked into using similar
language  Of course I admit there are many good people in the
church just as there were some good Pharisees who were opposed to
the crucifixion
The Express Buffalo New York Nov 4th 1878
THE SOLID SOUTH AND RESUMPTION
Question  Colonel to start with what do you think of the solid
South
Answer  I think the South is naturally opposed to the Republican
party more I imagine to the name than to the personnel of the
organization  But the South has just as good friends in the
Republican party as in the Democratic party  I do not think there
are any Republicans who would not rejoice to see the South prosperous
and happy  I know of none at least  They will have to get over
the prejudices born of isolation  We lack direct and constant
communication  I do not recollect having seen a newspaper from
the Gulf States for a long time  They down there may imagine
that the feeling in the North is the same as during the war  But
it certainly is not  The Northern people are anxious to be friendly
and if they can be without a violation of their principles they
will be  Whether it be true or not however most of the Republicans
of the North believe that no Republican in the South is heartily
welcome in that section whether he goes there from the North or
is a Southern man  Personally I do not care anything about partisan
politics  I want to see every man in the United States guaranteed
the right to express his choice at the ballotbox and I do not
want social ostracism to follow a man no matter how he may vote
A solid South means a solid North  A hundred thousand Democratic
majority in South Carolina means fifty thousand Republican majority
in New York in 1880  I hope the sections will never divide simply
as sections  But if the Republican party is not allowed to live
in the South the Democratic party certainly will not be allowed
to succeed in the North  I want to treat the people of the South
precisely as though the Rebellion had never occurred  I want all
that wiped from the slate of memory and all I ask of the Southern
people is to give the same rights to the Republicans that we are
willing to give to them and have given to them
Question  How do you account for the results of the recent
elections
Answer  The Republican party won the recent election simply
because it was for honest money and it was in favor of resumption
And if on the first of January next we resume all right and
maintain resumption I see no reason why the Republican party should
not succeed in 1880  The Republican party came into power at the
commencement of the Rebellion and necessarily retained power until
its close and in my judgment it will retain power so long as in
the horizon of credit there is a cloud of repudiation as large as
a mans hand
Question  Do you think resumption will work out all right
Answer  I do  I think that on the first of January the greenback
will shake hands with gold on an equality and in a few days
thereafter will be worth just a little bit more  Everything has
resumed except the Government  All the property has resumed all
the lands bonds and mortgages and stocks  All these things resumed
long agothat is to say they have touched the bottom  Now there
is no doubt that the party that insists on the Government paying
all its debts will hold control and no one will get his hand on
the wheel who advocates repudiation in any form  There is one
thing we must do though  We have got to put more silver in our
dollars  I do not think you can blame the New York banksany bank
for refusing to take eightyeight cents for a dollar  Neither
can you blame any depositor who puts gold in the bank for demanding
gold in return  Yes we must have in the silver dollar a dollars
worth of silver
The Commercial Cincinnati Ohio November 1878
THE SUNDAY LAWS OF PITTSBURG
Question  Colonel what do you think of the course the Mayor
has pursued toward you in attempting to stop your lecture
Answer  I know very little except what I have seen in the morning
paper  As a general rule laws should be enforced or repealed
and so far as I am personally concerned I shall not so much complain
of the enforcing of the law against Sabbath breaking as of the fact
that such a law exists  We have fallen heir to these laws  They
were passed by superstition and the enlightened people of today
should repeal them  Ministers should not expect to fill their
churches by shutting up other places  They can only increase their
