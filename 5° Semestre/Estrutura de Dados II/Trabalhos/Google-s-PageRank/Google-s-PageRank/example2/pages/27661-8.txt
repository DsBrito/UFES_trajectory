The Hill of the Muses
Sidenote From the Top of the Hill
The girl paused among the birches and drew a long breath of relief It
was good to be outdoors after the countless annoyances of the day to
feel the earth springing beneath her step the keen crisp air bringing
the colour to her cheeks and the silence of the woods ministering to
her soul
From the top of the hill she surveyed her little world Where the small
white houses clustered in the valley far below her she had spent her
fiveandtwenty years shut in by the hills and more surely by the
iron bars of circumstance To her the heights had always meant escape
for in the upper air and in solitude she found detachmenta sort of
heavenly perspective upon the affairs of the common day
Down in the bare brown valley the river lay asleep Grey patches of
melting snow still filled the crevices along its banks and fragments of
broken crystal moved slowly toward the ultimate sea The late afternoon
sun touched the sharp edges here and there to a faint iridescence
The rivergod dreams of rainbows thought Rosemary with a smile
Sidenote The Valley
Only one house was near the river the others were set farther back The
one upon the shore was the oldest and largest house in the valley
severely simple in line and with a certain air of stateliness The
broad Colonial porch looked out upon the river and the hills beyond it
while all around upon the southern slope between the opposite hills and
the valley were the great vineyards of the Marshs that had descended
from father to son during the century that had elapsed since the house
was built
The gnarled and twisted vines scarcely showed now upon the greybrown
background of the soil but in a few places where the snow had not yet
melted the tangled black threads were visible Like the frame
surrounding a tapestry great pines bordered the vineyard save on the
side nearest the valley for the first of the Marshs who had planted
the vineyard and built the house had taken care to protect his vines
from the northeast storms
The clanging notes of a bell mellowed by distance came faintly from
the valley below Rosemary took out the thin old watch that had been
her mothers and her mothers mothers before her and set the hands at
four upon the pale gold dial Then she drew up the worn gold chain that
hung around her neck under her gown and with the key that dangled
from it wound the watch In an hour or so probably it would stop but
it was pleasant to hear the cheerful little tick while she waited
Sidenote The Red Ribbon
The doors of the white schoolhouse in the valley burst open and the tide
of exuberant youth rushed forth Like so many ants the children swarmed
and scattered their shrill voices sounding afar Rosemary went to a
hollow tree took out a small wooden box opened it and unwound
carefully a wide ribbon of flaming scarlet a yard or more in length
Digging her heels into the soft earth she went down to the lowest of
the group of birches on the side of the hill that overlooked the
valley and tied the ribbon to a drooping bough Then she went back to
the top of the hill where a huge log rolled against two trees made a
comfortable seat for two people
Five minutes of the allotted twenty had passed since Rosemary had set
her watch At twenty minutes past four or at the most twentyfive he
would come For three years and more he had never failed to answer the
signal nor indeed to look for it when he brushed the chalk from his
clothes and locked the door of the schoolhouse behind him
A kindly wind in passing took the ribbon and made merry with it In
and out among the bare boughs of the birches it fluttered like a living
thing and Rosemary laughed aloud as she had not done for many days
The hill the scarlet signal and the man who was coming symbolised to
her the mysterious world of Romance
Sidenote World of Romance
Sometimes the birches were shy dryads fleeing before the wrath of some
unknown god At other times they were the Muses for as it happened
there were nine in the group and no others upon the hill The vineyard
across the valley was a tapestry where from earliest Spring until the
grapes were gathered colour and light were caught and imprisoned within
the web At the bend in the river where the rushes grew thickly the
rivergod kept his harp which answered with shy musical murmurings to
every vagrant wind
Again the hill was a tower and she a captive princess who had refused
to marry except for love and Love tarried strangely upon the way Or
sometimes she was the Elaine of an unknown Launcelot safely guarding
his shield She placed in the woods all the dear people of the books
held forever between the covers and bound to the printed page wondering
if they too did not long for freedom
The path up the hill wound in and out among the trees and so it
happened that Rosemary heard muffled footsteps before she saw him
coming A wayfaring squirrel the first of his family to venture out
scampered madly up a tree and looked down upon the girl with
questioning fearful eyes She rose from the log and looked up with her
hands outstretched in unconscious pleading
Sidenote He Comes
Oh she murmured dont be afraid of me
Im not answered a mans voice I assure you Im not
I wasnt speaking to you she laughed as she went to meet him
No he queried flushed and breathless from the climb I wonder if
there is anyone else for whom you wave red ribbons from your fortress
Take it down will you please
Wait until I get three full breathsthen I will
She went back to the log while he awkwardly untied the ribbon rolled it
up in clumsy masculine fashion and restored it to the wooden box in
the hollow tree Arent you cold he asked as he sat down beside her
NoIm too vividly alive to be cold ever
But whats the use of being alive unless you can live he inquired
discontentedly
She sighed and turned her face away The colour vanished from her
cheeks the youth from her figure Pensively she gazed across the
valley to the vineyard where the black knotted vines were blurred
against the soil in the fastgathering twilight His eyes followed hers
Sidenote Rosemary
I hate them he said passionately I wish Id never seen a grape
Were the children bad today she asked irrelevantly
Of course Arent they always bad Whats the use of caging up fifty
little imps and making em learn the multiplication table when they
dont even aspire to the alphabet Why should I have to teach em to
read and write when theyre determined not to learn Why do I have to
grow grapes when it would be the greatest joy of my life to know that
Id never have to see touch taste or even smell another grape in this
world or the next
She turned toward him A late Winter sunset shimmered in the west like
some pale transparent cloth of gold hung from the walls of heaven but
the kindly light lent no beauty to her face Rosemarys eyes were grey
and lustreless her hair ashen and almost without colour Her features
were irregular and her skin dull and lifeless She had not even the
indefinable freshness that is the divine right of youth Her mouth
drooped wistfully at the corners and even the halfdiscouraged dimple
in her chin looked like a dent or a scar
The bare hands that lay listlessly in her lap were rough and red from
much uncongenial toil He looked at her for a moment still absorbed in
himself then as he noted the pathos in every line of her face and
figure the expression of his face subtly changed His hand closed
quickly over hers
Sidenote Their Moods
Forgive me RosemaryIm a brute I have no right to inflict my moods
upon you
Why not Dont I bring mine to you
Sometimesnot often
Lets get them out where we can look them over she suggested
practically What do you hate most
Grapes he replied readily and then children who arent interested
in the alphabet All day Ive been saying See the cat Can the cat
run Yes the cat can run Of course they could repeat it after me but
they couldnt connect it in any way with the printed page I sympathised
strongly with an unwashed child of philosophical German lineage who
inquired earnestly Teacher whats the good of dat
What else do you hate
Being tied up Set down in one little corner of the world and being
obliged to stay in it I know to a certainty just whats going to happen
tomorrow and next day and the day after that Point out any day on the
calendar months ahead and I can tell you just what Ill be doing
Nothing is uncertain but the weather
Sidenote His Looks
Some people pray for anchorage she said
I never have he flashed back I want the open seatide and tempest
and grey surges with the wind in my face and the thrill of danger in my
heart I want my blood to race through my body I want to be hungry
cold despairing afraideverything God how I want to live
He paced back and forth restlessly his hands in his pockets Rosemary
watched him half afraid though his mood was far from strange to her
He was taller than the average man cleanshaven and superbly built
with every muscle ready and even eager for use His thirty years sat
lightly upon him though his dark hair was already slightly grey at the
temples for his great brown eyes were boyish and always would be In
the halflight his cleancut profile was outlined against the sky and
his mouth trembled perceptibly He had neither the thin colourless lips
that would have made men distrust him nor the thick lips that would
have warned women to go slowly with him and to watch every step
With obvious effort he shook himself partially free of his mood What
do you hate he asked gently
Brown alpaca sassafras tea the eternal dishes the scrubbing the
endless looking for dust where dust would never dare to stay and She
paused and bit her lips
Sidenote Always Fighting
Might as well go on he urged with a smile
I cant It isnt nice of me
But its true I dont know why you shouldnt hate your Grandmother and
your Aunt Matilda I do Its better to be truthful than nice
Is it
Sincerity always has a charm of its own Even when two men are
fighting you are compelled to admire their earnestness and singleness
of purpose
I wish you lived where you could admire Grandmother and Aunt Matilda
Theyre always fighting
No doubt Isnt it a little early for sassafras tea
I thought so but Grandmother said Spring was coming early this year
She feels it in her bones and she intends to be ready for it
She should know the signs of the seasons if anyone does How old is
she now
Something past eighty
Suffering Moses Eighty Springs and Summers and Autumns Let me seeI
was only twenty when I began with the grapes If I live to be eighty
that means Ive got to go to town sixty times to buy baskets sell the
crop and hire helpgo through the whole process from Spring to frost
sixty times and Ive only done it ten times Fifty more And when the
imps who unwillingly learned their multiplication table from me are
grandparents on their own account Ill still be saying See the cat
Can the cat run Yes the cat can run
Sidenote Slaves of the Vineyard
Why dont you sell the vineyard she asked though her heart sank at
the mere suggestion
Sell it Why didnt the Ancient Mariner sell his albatross and take a
nice little trip around the world on the proceeds Mother would die of a
broken heart if I mentioned it to her The Marsh family have been the
slaves of that vineyard since the first mistaken ancestor went into the
grape business Weve fertilised it pruned it protected it tied it
up sat up nights with it fanned the insects away from it hired people
to pick the fruit and pack it fed the people entertained them sent
presents to their wives and childrenweve done everything And what
have we had for it Only a very moderate living all the grapes we could
eat and a few bottles of musty old wine
Mother of course has very little to do with it and to her it has
come to represent some sort of entailed possession that becomes more
sacred every year Its a family heirloom like a title or some very
old and valuable piece of jewelry Other people have family plate and
family traditions but weve got a vineyard or to speak more
truthfully it has us
Sidenote Happy Muses
Look at the Muses said Rosemary after a silence Do you think
theyve gone to sleep
The nine slender birches that had apparently paused in their flight
down the hillside were indeed very still Not a twig stirred and the
white trunks were ghostly in the twilight Seemingly they leaned toward
each other for protection and support for comfort in the loneliness of
the night
Happy Muses he responded No vineyard to look after and no school to
teach
And no Grandmother continued Rosemary and no Aunt Nor any dishes
or brooms or scrubbingbrushes or stoves that are possessed by evil
spirits
Starlike a single light appeared in the front window of the big white
house on the shore of the river It was answered almost immediately by
another far across the stream
I like to watch the lights the girl went on The first one is always
in your house
Yes I know Mother dislikes twilight
Ours is the laston account of the price of oil
Here he said I almost forgot your book And I brought you two
candles this time You mustnt read by the light of oneyoull spoil
your eyes
Sidenote Saying GoodNight
Oh Mr Marsh Thank you so much
Youre very welcome Miss Starr
Please dont I like to have you call me Rosemary
Then you must call me Alden Ive been telling you that for almost two
years
I know but I cant make myself say it somehow Youre so much older
and wiser than I
Dont be vain of your youth Im only five years ahead of you and as
for wisdom anybody could teach a country school in Winter and grow
grapes the rest of the time
Im not so sure of that Come its getting late
They went down the hill together hand in hand like two children The
young mans mood had changed for the better and he was whistling
cheerfully They stopped at the corner where she must turn to go home
Goodnight she said
Goodnight Rosemary I wish I could come to see you sometimes
So do I but its better that you shouldnt
I dont see why you cant come over in the evenings occasionally I
always read to Mother and you might as well listen too Id gladly take
you home
It would be lovely she sighed but I cant
You know best he answered shivering Its pretty cold up there
most of the time
Sidenote Lonely Heights
The heights are always cold arent they
Yes and theyre supposed to be lonely too Goodnight again Let me
know how you like the book
Womanlike she watched him as he went down the street She liked the
way his head was set upon his broad shoulders she admired his long
swinging stride When his figure was lost in the gathering darkness she
turned regretfully and went home
II
Brown Alpaca
Sidenote A Cheerless Room
At seven oclock precisely Grandmother Starr limped into the
diningroom It was one of her lame days though sometimes she forgot
which was her lame side and limped irregularly and impartially with
either foot as chanced to please her erratic fancy
A small lamp cast a feeble unshaded light from the middle of the table
for the morning was dark and the room smelled abominably of oil The
flickering rays picked out here and there a bit of tarnished gold from
the wall paper and as though purposely made the worn spots in the
carpet unusually distinct Meaningless china ornaments crowded the
mantel but there was no saving grace of firelight in the small black
cavern beneath A little stove in one corner of the room smoked
industriously and refused to give out any heat
Rosemary said Grandmother Starr fretfully I dont see why you
cant never learn to build a fire Get me my shoulder shawl
Sidenote Cold and Cross
The girl compressed her pale lips into a thin tight line She was tired
and her head ached but she said nothing She found the shawl of
redandblack plaid and spread it over the old ladys shoulders
I didnt say for you to put it on remarked Grandmother sourly If
Id wanted you to put it on me Id have said so Guess I aint so old
yet but what I can put on my own shawl What I want it for is to wrap up
my hands in
Wheres my shawl demanded Aunt Matilda entering the room at that
moment
Rosemary found the other shawl of blueandbrown plaid and silently
offered it to the owner
Aunt Matilda inclined her grey head toward Rosemary You can put it on
me if you like I aint ashamed to say Im cold when I am and if I
wanted to wrap up my hands Id get my mittensI wouldnt take a whole
shawl
You aint got no reason to be cold as I see remarked Grandmother
sharply Folks what lays abed till almost seven oclock ought to be
nice and warm unless theyre lazy Praps if you moved around more
your blood would warm you
Better try it Matilda suggested pointedly
An angry flush mounted to Grandmothers temples where the thin white
hair was drawn back so tightly that it must have hurt Ive moved
around some in my day she responded shrilly but I never got any
thanks for it What with sweepin and dustin and scrubbin and washin
and ironin and bringin up children and feedin pigs and cows and
chickens and churnin and waitin on your father its no wonder Im a
helpless cripple with the misery in my back
Sidenote Head of the House
Dried peaches again Matilda observed scornfully as Rosemary put a
small saucer of fruit before her Who told you to get dried peaches
I did if you want to know Grandmother snorted This is my house
aint it
Ive heard tell that it was Matilda answered and Im beginnin to
believe it
Miss Matilda was fortysix but in the pitiless glare of the odorous
lamp she looked much older Her hair was grey and of uneven length so
that short straight hair continually hung about her face without even
the saving grace of fluffiness Her eyes were steelblue and cold her
nose large and her mouth large also Her lips drooped at the corners and
there was a wart upon her chin
Grandmother also had a wart but it was upon her nose Being a friendly
and capable sort of wart it held her steelbowed spectacles at the
proper angle for reading or knitting During conversation she peered
over her spectacles and sometimes to the discomfort of a sensitive
observer the steel frame appeared to divide her eyes horizontally
Sidenote All Wrong
They were very dark beady eyes set close together At times they
gleamed with the joy of conflict but they always expressed a certain
malicious cunning With a single glance she could make Rosemary feel
mentally undressed Had the girls forehead been transparent like the
crystal of a watch with the machinery of thought and emotion fully
exposed to the eye of a mastermechanic her sensation could not have
differed from the helpless awe her grandmother so easily inspired
Of course the breakfast was not rightit never was The dried peaches
were too sweet for one and not sweet enough for the other Grandmother
wanted her oatmeal cooked to a paste but Aunt Matilda whose teeth were
better desired something that must be chewed before it was swallowed
and unhesitatingly said so The coffee was fated to please neither
though as Rosemary found courage to say you couldnt expect good
coffee on Friday when the same grounds had been used ever since Sunday
morning
Id like to know what makes you so high and mighty all of a sudden
said Grandmother Coffees just like teaas long as colour comes into
it when its boiled its good My mother always used the same grounds
for a week for a family of eight and she didnt hear no complaints
neither You aint boiled this long enoughthats whats the matter
Sidenote The Common Task
Aunt Matilda muttered something about beggars being choosers and
Rosemary pushed her plate away wearily She had not tasted her
breakfast
Grandmother arose and noisily blew out the lamp regardless of the fact
that Matilda had not finished eating Now Rosemary she said
briskly after you get the dishes done and the kitchen cleaned up I
want you should go to the postoffice and get my paper When you come
back you can do the sweepin and dustin down here and I can set in the
kitchen while youre doin it Then you can make the beds and do the
upstairs work and then go to the store By the time youre ready to go
to the store Ill have decided what youre to get
And continued Aunt Matilda pushing back her chair this afternoon
you can help me cut out some underclothes and get em basted together
She never attempted any sort of housework being pathetically vain of
her one beautyher small white hands Even the family sewing she did
under protest
Is the alpaca all gone asked Grandmother
Yes Matilda replied I used the last of it patchin Rosemarys dress
under the arms It beats all how hard she is on her clothes
Sidenote A Question of Colour
Ill have to order more sighed the old lady I suppose the price has
gone up again
Rosemarys breath came and went quickly her heart fluttered with a
sudden wildness Grandmother she pleaded hesitatingly oh Aunt
Matildajust for this once couldnt I have grey alpaca instead of
brown I hate brown so
Both women stared at her as though she had all at once gone mad The
silence became intense painful
I mean faltered the girl if its the same price I wouldnt ask you
to pay any more Perhaps grey might be cheaper noweven cheaper than
brown
I was married in brown alpaca said Grandmother She used the tone in
which royalty may possibly allude to coronation
I was wearing brown alpaca observed Aunt Matilda the night the
minister came to call
Made just like this they said together
If brown alpacas good enough for weddins and ministers I reckon
itll do for orphans that dont half earn their keep resumed
Grandmother with her keen eyes fixed upon Rosemary
What put the notion into your head queried Aunt Matilda with the
air of one athirst for knowledge
Sidenote A Surprise Party
Whynothing the girl stammered except thatwhen I was looking at
mothers things the other day up in the attic I found some pink
ribbon and I thought it would be pretty with grey and if I had a grey
dress
The other two exchanged glances Aint it wonderful asked Matilda of
her mother how blood will tell
It certainly is responded Grandmother polishing her spectacles
vigorously with a corner of the plaid shawl Your ma she went on to
Rosemary was wearin grey when your pa brought her here to visit us
They was a surprise partyboth of em We didnt even know he was
plannin marriage and I dont believe he was either Weve always
thought your ma roped him into it somehow
Rosemarys eyes filled with mist and she bit her lips
She was wearin grey continued Aunt Matilda light grey that would
show every spot I told her it wasnt a very serviceable colour and she
had the impudence to laugh at me Itll clean wont it she says
just like that and Frank says right after her Yes itll clean He
knew a lot about it he did She had psychologised him
You mean hypnotised interrupted Grandmother There aint no such
word as psychologised
Sidenote Resentment
Well if there aint there ought to be
The pink has come out in the blood too Grandmother remarked
adjusting her spectacles firmly upon the everuseful and unfailing wart
She was wearin pink roses on her bonnet and pink ribbon strings It
wouldnt surprise me if it was the very strings what Rosemary has found
in the trunk and is layin out to wear
Me neither Matilda chimed in
She was wearin lace on her petticoats and highheeled shoes and all
her handkerchiefs was fine linen Grandmother continued Maybe youd
like some lace ruffles under your grey alpaca wouldnt you Rosemary
The girl got to her feet blindly She gathered up the dishes with cold
hands that trembled took them out into the kitchen and noiselessly
closed the door Her heart was hot with resentment even though she had
heard the story with variations ever since she was old enough to
understand it
Poor little mother said Rosemary to herself Dear little mother
Why couldnt you have taken me with you
As Grandmother had said for the hundredth time and more Frank Starr
had brought home his young wife unexpectedly The surprise in itself
was a shock from which she and Matilda had never recovered Even now
they were fond of alluding to the years of illhealth directly caused by
it and of subtly blaming Rosemary for it
Sidenote An Orphan
At the end of the third day the young couple had departed hastily the
bride in tears A year or so afterward when Rosemary was born the
little mother died having lived only long enough to ask that the baby
be named RosemaryRose for her own mother and Mary for Grandmother
Starr
Stern whitefaced and brokenhearted Frank Starr brought his child to
his mother and sister and almost immediately went West Intermittently
he wrote briefly sent money gave insufficient addresses or none at
all and at length disappeared At the time his last letter was
written he had expected to take a certain steamer plying along the
Western coast As the ship was wrecked and he was never heard from
again it seemed that Rosemary was an orphan dependent upon her
grandmother and aunt
In their way they were kind to her She was sent to school regularly
and had plenty to eat and wear of a certain sort Every Spring Aunt
Matilda made the years supply of underclothing using for the purpose
coarse unbleached muslin thriftily purchased by the bolt The brown
alpaca and brown gingham in which she and her grandmother and aunt had
been dressed ever since she could remember were also bought by the
piece The fashion of the garments had not changed for one way of
making a gown was held to be as good as another and a great deal
easier if the maker were accustomed to doing it
Sidenote Year after Year
So year after year Rosemary wore full skirts of brown alpaca gathered
into a band and tightfitting waists boned and lined buttoning down
the front with a row of small jet buttons The sleeves were always long
plain and tight no matter what other people were wearing A bit of
cheap lace gathered at the top of the collar was the only attempt at
adornment
The brown ginghams were made in the same way except that the waists
were not boned The cheap white muslin which served as Rosemarys best
Summer gown was made like the ginghams Her Winter hat was brown felt
trimmed with brown ribbon her Summer hat was brown straw trimmed with
brown ribbon and her Winter coat was also brown of some heavy material
which wore surpassingly well
For years her beautyloving soul had been in revolt but never before
had she dared to suggest a change The lump in her throat choked her as
she washed the dishes heedless of the tears that fell into the
