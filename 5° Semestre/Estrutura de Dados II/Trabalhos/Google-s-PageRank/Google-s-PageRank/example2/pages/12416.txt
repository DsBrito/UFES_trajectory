FIRST LETTERON THE WAY
In this day and generation when everybody goes to Europe it is
difficult to discover the only person who never has been there But I
am that one and therefore the stir it occasioned in the bosom of my
amiable family when I announced that I too was about to join the
vast majority is not easy to imagine But if you think that I at once
became a person of importance it only goes to show that you do not
know the family My mother to be sure hovered around me the way she
does when she thinks I am going into typhoid fever I never have had
typhoid fever but she is always on the watch for it and if it ever
comes it will not catch her napping She will meet it halfway And
lest it elude her watchfulness she minutely questions every pain
which assails any one of us for fear it may be her dreaded foe Yet
when my sisters blessed lamb baby had it before he was a year old
and after he had got well and I was not afraid he would be struck dead
for my wickedness I said to her Well mamma you must have taken
solid comfort out of the first real chance you ever had at your pet
fever she said I ought to be ashamed of myself
My father began to explain international banking to me as his share in
my preparations but I utterly discouraged him by asking the
difference between a check and a note He said I reminded him of the
juryman who asked the difference between plaintiff and defendant I
soothed him by assuring him that I knew I would always find somebody
to go to the bank with me
Most likely twill be Providence then as He watches over children
and fools said my cousin with what George Eliot calls the brutal
candor of a near relation
My brotherinlaw lent me ten Baedekers and offered his hampers and
French trunks to me with such reckless generosity that I had to get my
sister to stop him so that I wouldnt hurt his feelings by refusing
My sister said I am perfectly sure mamma that if I dont go with
her she will go about with an ecstatic smile on her face and let
herself get cheated and lost and she would just as soon as not tell
everybody that she had never been abroad before She has no pride
Then you had better come along and take care of me and see that I
dont disgrace you I urged
Really mamma I do think I had better go said my sister So she
actually consented to leave husband and baby in order to go and take
care of me I do assure you however that I have bought all the
tickets and carried the common purse and got her through the
customhouses and arranged prices thus far But she does pack my
trunks and make out the laundry listsI will say that for her
My brothers contribution to my comfort was in this wise He said
You must have a few more lessons on your wheel before you go and
Ill take you out for a lesson tomorrow if youll get up and go at
six oclock in the morningthat is if youll wear gloves But you
mortify me half to death riding without gloves
Nobody sees me but milkmen I said humbly
Well what will the milkmen think said my brother
Mercy on us I never thought of that I said My gloves are all
pretty tight when one has to grip ones handlebars as fiercely as I
do But Ill get large ones What tint do you think milkmen care the
most for
He sniffed
Well Ill go and Ill wear gloves I said but if I fall off
remember it will be on account of the gloves
You always do fall off he said with patient resignation Ive
seen you fall off that wheel in more different directions than it has
spokes
I dont exactly fall I explained carefully I feel myself going
and then I get off
I was ready at six the next morning and I wore gloves
Now dont ride into the holes in the streetone is obliged to give
such instructions in Chicagoand dont look at anything you see
Dont be afraid Youre all right Now then Youre off
Oh Teddy dont ride so close to me I quavered
Im forty feet away from you he said
Then double it I said Youre choking me by your proximity
Lets cross the railroad tracks just for practice he said when it
was too late for me to expostulate Stand up on your pedals and ride
fast and
Hold on please do I shrieked Im falling off Get out of my way
I seem to be turning
He scorched ahead and I headed straight for the switchmans hut
rounded it neatly and leaned myself and my wheel against the side of
it helpless with laughter
A red Irish face with a short black pipe in its mouth thrust itself
out of the tiny window just in front of me and a voice with a rich
brogue exclaimed
As purty a bit of riding as iver Oi see
Wasnt it I cried You couldnt do it
Oi wouldnt thry Oid rather tackle a railroad train going at full
spheed thin wan av thim runaway critturs
Get down from there hissed my brother so close to my ear that it
made me bite my tongue
I obediently scrambled down Teds face was very red
You ought to be ashamed of yourself to enter into immediate
conversation with a man like that What do you suppose that man
thought of you
Oh perhaps he saw my gloves and took me for a lady I pleaded
Ted grinned and assisted me to mount
When I successfully turned the corner by making Ted fall back out of
sight we rode away along the boulevard in silence for a while for my
conversation when I am on a wheel is generally limited to shrieks
ejaculations and snatches of prayer I never talk to be amusing
I say said my brother hesitatingly I wear a No 8 glove and a
No 10 stocking
Ive always thought you had large hands and feet I said ignoring
the hint
He giggled
No now really I wish youd write that down somewhere You can get
those things so cheap in Paris
You are supposing the case of my return or of Christmas intervening
ora present of some kind I suppose
Well no not exactly Although you know I am always broke
Dont I though
And that I am still in debt
Because papa insists upon your putting some money in the bank every
month
Yes and the result is that I never get my head above water I owe
you twenty now
Which I never expect to recover because you know I always get silly
about Christmas and forgive thee thy debts
Youre awful good he began
But Ill be better if I bring you gloves and silk stockings
Ill give you the money he said heroically Will you borrow it of
me or of mamma I asked with a chuckle at the family financiering
which always goes on in this manner
Now dont make fun of me You dont know what it is to be hard up
Dont I though I said indignantly Ohoh Catch me
He seized my handlebar and righted me before I fell off
See what you did by saying I never was hard up I said Ill tell
you what Teddy You neednt give me the money Ill bring you some
gloves and stockings
Oh I say honest Oh but youre the right kind of a sister Ill
never forget that as long as I live You do look so nice on your
wheel You sit so straight and
I saw a milkman coming We three were the only objects in sight yet I
headed for him
Get out of my way I shrieked at him Im a beginner Turn off
He lashed his horse and cut down a side street
What a narrow escape I sighed How glad I am I happened to think
of that
I looked up pleasantly at Ted He was biting his lips and he looked
raging
You are the most hopeless girl I ever saw he burst out I wish you
didnt own a wheel
I dont I said The wheel owns me
You havent the manners of
Stockings I said looking straight ahead Silk stockings with
polka dots embroidered on them No 10
Ted looked sheepish
I ride so well I proceeded I sit up so straight and look so
nice
No answer
Gloves I went on still without looking at him White and pearl
ones for evening and russet gloves for the street No 8
Oh quit wont you Im sorry I said that But if you only knew how
you mortify me
Cheer up Tedcastle I am going away you know And when I come back
you will either have got over caring so much or I will be more of a
lady
Im sorry you are going said my brother But as you are going
perhaps you will let me use your rooms while you are gone Your bed is
the best one I ever slept in and your study would be bully for the
boys when they come to see me
I was too stunned to reply He went on utterly oblivious of my
consternation
And I am going to use your wheel while you are gone if you dont
mind to take the girls out on I know some awfully nice girls who can
ride but their wheels are last years make and they wont ride them
Id rather like to be able to offer them a new wheel
I am not going to take all my party dresses Have you any use for
them I said
Why whats the matter Wont you let me have your rooms
Merciful heavens child I should say not
Why I havent asked you for much said my small modest brother
You offered
Well just wait till I offer the rest But Ill tell you what I will
do Ted If you will promise not to go into my rooms and rummage once
while I am gone and not to touch my wheel Ill buy you a tandem and
then you can take the girls on that
Id rather have you bring me some things from Europe said my
shrinking brother
All right Ill do that but let me off this thing I am so tired I
cant move Youll have to walk it back and give me five cents to ride
home on the car
I crawled in to breakfast more dead than alive
Whats the matter dearie Did you ride too far asked mamma
I dont know whether I rode too far or whether it was Teds asking if
he couldnt use my rooms while I was gone but something has made me
tired Whats that Whom is papa talking to over the telephone
Papa came in fuming and fretting
Who was it this time I questioned with anticipation Inquiries
over the telephone were sure to be interesting to me just now
Somebody who wanted to know what train you were going on but would
not give his name He was inquiring for a friend he said and
wouldnt give his friends name either
Didnt you tell him I cried in distress
Certainly not I told him nobody but an idiot would withhold his
name
Papa calls such a variety of men idiots
Oh but it was probably only flowers or candy Why didnt you tell
him Have you no sentiment
I wont have you receiving anonymous communications he retorted
with the liberty fathers have a little way of taking with their
daughters
But flowers I pleaded It is no harm to send flowers without a
card Dont you see Oh how hard it is to explain a delicate point
like that to ones fatherin broad daylight I am supposed to know
who sent them
But would you know asked my practical ancestor
Notnot exactly But it would be almost sure to be one of them
Ted shouted But there was nothing funny in what I said Boys are so
silly
Anyway I am sorry you didnt tell him I said
Well Im not declared papa
The rest of the day fairly flew The last night came and the baby was
put to bed I undressed him which he regarded as such a joke that he
worked himself into a fever of excitement He loves to scrub like
Josie the cook I had bought him a little red pail and I gave it to
him that night when he was partly undressed and he was so enchanted
with it that he scampered around hugging it and saying Pile
pile like a little Cockney He gave such squeals of ecstasy that
everybody came into the nursery to find him scrubbing his crib with a
nailbrush and little red pail
Who gave you the pretty pail Billy asked Aunt Lida who was
sitting by the crib
Tattah said Billy in a whisper He always whispers my name
Then go and kiss dear auntie She is going away on the big boat to
stay such a long time
Billys face sobered Then he dropped his precious pail and came and
licked my face like a little dog which is his way of kissing
I squeezed him until he yelled
Dont let him forget me I wailed Talk to him about me every day
And buy him a toy out of my money often and tell him Tattah sent it
to him Oh oh hell be grown up when I come home
Dont cry dearie said Aunt Lida handing me her handkerchief
Ill see that your grave is kept green
My sister appeared at the door She was all ready to start She even
had her veil on
What do you mean by exciting Billy so at this time of night she
said Go out all of you Well lose the train Hush somebodys at
the telephone Papas talking to that same man again I jumped up and
ran out
Let me answer it papa dear Yes yes yes certainly Tonight on
the Pennsylvania Youre quite welcome Not at all I hung up the
telephone
I could hear papa in the nursery
She actually told himafter all I said this morning I never heard
of anything like it
Two or three voices were raised in my defence Ted slipped out into
the hall
Bully for you he whispered Youll get the flowers all right at
the train Who do you spose theyre from Another box just came for
you Say couldnt you leave that smallest box of violets in the
silver box I want to give them to a girl and youve got such loads
of others
Dont ask her for those answered my dear sister they are the most
precious of all
I cant give you any of mine I said but Ill buy you a box for
hera small box I added hastily
The carriages have come dears quavered grandmamma coming out of
the nursery followed by the family one after the other
Get her satchels Teddy Her hat is upstairs Her flowers are in the
hall She left her ulster on my bed and her books are on the
windowsill said mamma She wouldnt look at me Remember dearie
your medicines are all labelled and I put needles in your workbox
all threaded Dont sit in draughts and dont read in a dim light
Have a good time and study hard and come back soon Goodbye my
girlie God bless you
By this time no handkerchief would have sufficed for my tears I
reached out blindly and Ted handed me a towel
Ive got a sheet when youve sopped that he said Boys are such
brutes
Aunt Lida said Goodbye my dearest You are my favorite niece You
know I love you the best
I giggled for she tells my sister the same thing always
Nobody seems to care much that I am going said Bee mournfully
But you are coming back so soon and she is going to stay so long
exclaimed grandmamma patting Bee
Ill bet she doesnt stay a year cried Ted
Ill expect her home by Christmas said papa
Ill bet she is here to eat Thanksgiving dinner cried my
brotherinlaw
No she is sure to stay as long as she has said she would said
mamma
Mothers are the brace of the universe The family trailed down to the
front door Everybody was carrying something There were two
carriages for they were all going to the station with us
For all the world like a funeral with loads of flowers and everybody
crying said my brother cheerfully
I never shall forget that drive to the station nor the last few
moments when Bee and I stood on the carsteps and talked to those who
were on the platform of the station Can anybody else remember how she
felt at going to Europe for the first time and leaving everybody she
loved at home Bee grieved because there were no flowers at the train
after all But the next morning they appeared a tremendous box
arranged as a surprise
Telegrams came popping in at all the big stations along the way
enlivening our gloom and at the steamer there were such loads of
things that we might almost have set up as a florist or fruiterer or
bookseller Such a lapful of steamer letters and telegrams I read a
few each morning and some of them I read every morning
I dont like ocean travel They sent grapefruit and confections to my
stateroom which I tossed out of the porthole You know there are
some people who think you dont know what you want I travelled
horizontally most of the way and now people roar when I say I wasnt
ill Well I wasnt you know Wewell Teddy would not like me to be
more explicit I own to a horrible headache which never left me I
deny everything else Let them laugh I was there and I know
The steamer I went on allows men to smoke on all the decks and they
all smoked in my face It did not help me I must say that I was
unspeakably thankful to get my foot on dry ground once more When we
got to the dock a special train of toy cars took us through the
greenest of green landscapes and suddenly almost before we knew it
we were at Waterloo Station and knew that London was at our door
II
LONDON
People said to me What are you going to London for I said To
get an English point of view Very well said one of the knowing
ones who has lived abroad the larger part of his life then you must
go to The Insular in Piccadilly That is not only the smartest
hotel in London but it is the most typically British The rooms are
let from season to season to the best country families There you will
find yourself plunged headlong into English life with not an American
environment to bless yourself with and you will soon get your English
point of view
Ahh responded the simpleton who goes by my name that is what we
want We will go to The Insular
We wrote at once for rooms and then telegraphed for them from
Southampton
The steamer did not land her passengers until the morning of the ninth
day which shows the vast superiority of going on a fast boat which
gets you in fully as much as fifteen or twenty minutes ahead of the
slow ones
Our luggage would not go on even a fourwheeler so we took a dear
little private bus and proceeded to put our mountainous American
trunks on it We filled the top of this bus as full as it would hold
and put everything else inside After stowing ourselves in there would
not have been room even for another umbrella
In this fashion we reached The Insular where we were received by
four or five gorgeous creatures in livery the head one of whom said
Miss Columbia I admitted it and we were ushered in where we were
met by more belonging to this tribe of gorgeousness another of whom
said Miss Columbia
Yes I said firmly privately wondering if they were trying to trip
me into admitting that I was somebody else
The housekeeper will be here presently said this person She is
expecting you
Forth came the housekeeper
Miss Columbia she said
Once again I said Yes patiently standing on my other foot
If you will be good enough to come with me I will show you your
rooms
A door opened outward disclosing a little square place with two
canebottomed chairs A man bounced out so suddenly that I nearly
annihilated my sister who was back of me I could not imagine what
this little cubbyhole was but as there seemed to be nowhere else to
go I went in The others followed then the man who had bounced out
He closed the door and shut us in where we stood in solemn silence
About a quarter of an hour afterwards I thought I saw something
through the glass moving slowly downward and then an infinitesimal
thrill in the soles of my feet led me to suspect the truth
Is this thing an elevator I whispered to my sister
No they call it a lift over here she whispered back
I know that I murmured impatiently But is this thing it Are we
moving Are we going anywhere
Why of course my dear They are slower than ours thats all
I listened to her with some misgivings for her information is not
always to be wholly trusted but this time it happened that she was
right for after a while we came to the fourth floor where our rooms
were
I wish you could have seen the size of them I shall not attempt to
describe them for you would not believe me I had engaged two rooms
and a bath The two rooms were there Where is the bath I said
The housekeeper lovingly removed a gigantic crash towel from a
hideous tin object and proudly exposed to my vision that object which
is next dearest to his silk hat to an Englishmans hearta hipbath
tub Her manner said Beat that if you can
My sister prodded me in the back with her umbrella which in our sign
language means Dont make a scene
Very well I said rather meekly Have our trunks sent up
Very good madam
She went away and then we rang the bell and began to order what were
to us the barest necessities of life We were tired and lame and
sleepy from a night spent at the pier landing the luggage and we
wanted things with which to make ourselves comfortable
There was a pocket edition of a fireplace and they brought us a
hatful of the vilest soft coal which peppered everything in the rooms
with soot
We climbed over our trunks to sit by this imitation of a fire only to
find that there was nothing to sit on but the most uncompromising of
straightbacked chairs
We groaned as we took in the situation To our poor racked frames a
coalhod would not have suggested more discomfort We dragged up our
hampers packed with steamerrugs and pillows and my sister sat on
hers while I took another turn at the bell While the maid is
answering this bell I shall have plenty of time to tell you what we
afterwards discovered the process of bellringing in an English hotel
to be
We rang our bell Presently we heard the most horrible gong such as
we use on our patrol wagons and fireengines at home This clanged
four times Then a second bell down the hall answered it Then feet
flew by our door At this juncture my sister and I prepared to let
ourselves down the fireescape But we soon discovered that those
flying feet belonged to the poor maid whom that gong had signalled
that she was wanted on the fourth floor She flew to a speakingtube
and asked who on the fourth floor wanted her She was then given the
number of our room when she rang a bell to signify that our call was
answered by which time she was at liberty and knocked at our door
saying in her soft English voice Did you ring miss
We told her we wanted rockingchairs She said there was not one in
the house Then easychairs we said or anything cushioned or low or
comfortable She said the housekeeper had no easier chairs
We sat down on our hampers and my sister leaned against the corner of
the wardrobe with a pillow at her back to keep from being cut in two
I propped my back against the washstand which did very well except
that the washstand occasionally slid away from me
This said my sister impressively is England
We had been here only half an hour but I had already got my point of
view
Lets go out and look up a hotel where they take Americans I said
I feel the need of icewater
Our drinkingwater at The Insular was on the end of the washstand
nearest the fire
So feeling a little timid and nervous but not in the least homesick
we went downstairs One of our gorgeous retinue called a cab and we
entered it
Where shall we go asked my sister
I feel like saying to the first hotel we see I said
Just then we raised our eyes and they rested simultaneously upon a
sign The Empire Hotel for Cats and Dogs This simple solution of
our difficulty put us in such high good humor that we said we wouldnt
look up a hotel just yetwe would take a drive
Under these circumstances we took our first drive down Piccadilly and
Europe to me dates from that moment The ship the landing the
customhouse the train the hotelall these were mere preliminaries
to the Europe which began then People told me in America how my
heart would swell at this and how I would thrill at that but it was
not so My first real thrill came to me in Piccadilly It went all
over me in little shivers and came out at the ends of my fingers and
then began once more at the base of my brain and did it all over
again
But what is the use of describing ones first view of London streets
and traffic to the initiated Can they who became used to it as
children appreciate it Can they look back and recall how it struck
them No When I try to tell Americans over here they look at me
curiously and say Dear me how odd The way they say it leaves me
to draw any one of three conclusions either they are not
impressionable and are therefore honest in denying the feeling or
they think it vulgar to admit it or I am the only grown person in
America who never has been to Europe before
But I am indifferent to their opinion People are right in saying this
great tremendous rush of feeling can come but once It is like being
in love for the first time You like it and yet you dont like it You
wish it would go away yet you fear that it will go all too soon It
gets into your head and makes you dizzy and you want to shut your
eyes but you are afraid if you do that you will miss something You
cannot eat and you cannot sleep and you feel that you have two
consciousnesses one which belongs to the life you have lived
hitherto and which still is going on somewhere in the world
unmindful of you and you unmindful of it and the other is this new
bliss which is beating in your veins and sounding in your ears and
shining before your eyes which no one knows and no one dreams of but
which keeps a smile on your lipsa smile which has in it nothing of
humor nothing from the great without but whichcomes from the secret
recesses of your own inner consciousness where the heart of the
matter lies
I remember nothing definite about that first drive I for my part
saw with unseeing eyes My sister had seen it all before so she had
the power of speech Occasionally she prodded me and cried Look oh
look quickly But I never swerved I cant look If I do I shall
miss something You attend to your own window and Ill attend to mine
Coming back I will see your side
When we got beyond the shops I said to the cabman
Do you know exactly the way you have come
Yes miss he said
Then go back precisely the same way
Have you lost something miss he inquired
Yes I said I have lost an impression and I must look till I find
it
Very good miss he said
If I had said I have carelessly let fall my cathedral or I have
lost my orangoutang Look for him an imperturbable British cabby
would only touch his cap and say Very good miss
So we followed our own trail back to The Insular In this way I
said to my sister we both get a complete view Tomorrow we will do
it all over again
But we found that we could not wait for the morrow We did it all over
again that afternoon and that second time I was able in a measure to
detach myself from the hum and buzz and the dizzying effect of foreign
faces and I began to locate impressions My first distinct
recollections are of the great numbers of high hats on the men the
illhanging skirts and big feet of the women the unsteadying effect
of all those thousands of cabs carriages and carts all going to the
left which kept me constantly wishing to shriek out Go to the right
or well all be killed the absolutely perfect manner in which
traffic was managed and the majestic authority of the London police
I have seen the Houses of Parliament and the Tower and Westminster
Abbey and the Worlds Fair but the most impressive sight I ever
beheld is the upraised hand of a London policeman I never heard one
of them speak except when spoken to But let one little bluecoated
