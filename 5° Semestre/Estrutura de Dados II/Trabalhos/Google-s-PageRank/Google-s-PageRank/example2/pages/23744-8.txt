AHEAD OF THE ARMY
CHAPTER I
FARAWAY GUNS
Boom Boom Boom
The long surges of the Gulf of Mexico were beating heavily upon the
sandy beach of Point Isabel but the dull and boding sounds were not the
roar of the surf There came a long silence and then another boom Each
in succession entered the white tents of the American army on the
upland carrying with it a message of especial importance to all who
were within It was also of more importance to the whole world than any
man who heard it could then have imagined It spoke to the sentries at
their posts and compelled them to turn and listen It halted all
patrolling and scouting parties making them stand still to utter sudden
exclamations More than one mounted officer reined in his horse to
hear and then wheeled to spur away toward the tent of General Zachary
Taylor commanding the forces of the United States upon the Rio Grande
In one small tent in the camp of the Seventh Infantry the first boom
stirred up a young man who had been sleeping and he may have been
dreaming of home He was in the uniform of a second lieutenant and in
one respect he was exactly like all the other younger officers and most
of the men of that army for never before had they heard the sound of a
hostile cannon War was new to them and they were not aware how many of
them were now entering a preparatory school in which they were to be
trained for service in a war of vastly greater proportions and for the
command of its contending armies on either side
Up sprang the young lieutenant and stepped to the door of his tent He
was short strongly built and his alert vigorous movements indicated
unusual nerve vitality and muscular strength
Grant my boy he muttered to himself that comes from the fort The
Mexicans are attacking Its more than twenty miles away I didnt know
you could hear guns as far as that but the winds in the right
direction Hurrah The war has begun
He was only half right The war had been begun long years before by
aggressive American settlers in the SpanishMexican State of Texas Now
at last the United States had taken up the same old conflict and only
about half of the American people at all approved of it
Grant did not linger in front of his tent He walked rapidly away to
where stood a group of officers hardly any of them older than himself
Meade he demanded of one of them what do you think of that
I think I dont know how long that halffinished fort can hold out
responded Lieutenant Meade and half a dozen other voices instantly
agreed with him as to the perils surrounding the small besieged
garrison
It was hardly possible they said that it could hold out until the
arrival of the main army This too would have to fight all the way
against superior numbers but that was a thing which it could do and
they were all wild with eagerness to be on the march in answer to the
summons of those faraway guns
There were no railroads to speak of and only the first small beginnings
of telegraphs in the year 1846 The news of the first fighting would
therefore be slow in reaching the President and Congress at Washington
so that they might lawfully make what is called a formal declaration of
war Much had already been taken for granted but the American
government was at that hour anxiously leaning southward and listening
for the expected roar of Mexican cannon It came as rapidly as General
Taylor could send it A swift despatchboat with all her canvas up
went speeding across the gulf to New Orleans Thence in the hands of
special couriers it would gallop all the remaining distance Meantime
the struggle at the Rio Grande frontier would continue just as if all
the legal arrangements had been made but it would be weeks before
Europe could be advised of what was going on All this too when this
fight over the annexation of Texas was about to lift the Republic into a
foremost place among the nations It was to give her all the Pacific
coast which she now has except Oregon and Alaska with the gold of
California and the silver of the mountains Among its consequences were
to be the terrible Civil War the abolition of slavery the acquisition
of the Sandwich Islands and many another vast change in the history of
our country and in that of these very European nations which were then
ignorantly sitting still and thinking little about it because they had
no ocean cable telegraphs to outrun the swift clipper ships
There were couriers racing inland in all directions to tell the people
of Mexico also that war had come but the despatches of the general
commanding their forces on the Texas border were carried by a swift
schooner from Matamoras on the coast directly to Vera Cruz A
messenger from that port had before him a gallop of only two hundred and
sixty miles to the city of Mexico President Paredes therefore had
full information of the attack on the American fort sooner than did
President Polk by a number of very important days
These were bright May days and during all of them there were other
things going on which had a direct relation to the cannonfiring and the
siege For instance all the commerce between Mexico and the rest of the
world was deeply interested and so were all the warships of the United
States which were prepared to interfere with that commerce pretty soon
and shut it off There were merchant vessels at sea to whose captains
and owners it was a serious question whether or not cruisers carrying
the Stars and Stripes would permit them to reach their intended port
and deliver their cargoes Whatever may have been the case with all the
rest of these vessels one of them in particular appeared to be rushing
along in a great hurry at the very hour when Lieutenant Grant woke up so
suddenly and walked out of his tent
She carried an American flag somewhat tattered and she was spreading
quite as much canvas as a prudent skipper might have considered safe
under the strong gale that was blowing She was barkrigged of about
four hundred tons burden and was headed westward in the Nicholas
Channel off the northerly coast of the Island of Cuba There was a high
sea running but the ship stood up well and the few men who were on
deck could get about easily Even a boy of apparently not over
seventeen who came to a halt near the mainmast managed to keep his
balance with some help from a rope That he did so was a credit to him
and it helped to give him a sailorlike and jaunty air So did his blue
trousers blue flannel shirt with a wide collar and the sidewise pitch
of his tarpaulin hat He might as well have remarked aloud that he was
one of those boys who are up to almost anything and who think small
potatoes of a mere storm at sea Near him however stood a pair of men
either of whom might have felt as much at home under another flag than
the one which was now fluttering its damaged bunting above them The
shorter of the two was a very darkfaced gentleman of perhaps forty
with piercing black eyes In spite of his civilian dress he wore an
expression that was decidedly warlike or soldierly
Captain Kemp he said to his companion will you be good enough to
tell me why we are in the Nicholas Channel
No Senor Zuroaga growled the largeframed roughly rigged and
grimlooking sailor Im capn o this ship and I dont give
explanations Weve had gales on gales since we left port One course is
as good as another if youre not losing distance Well reach Vera Cruz
now three or four days sooner than we reckoned All those war insurance
risks were paid for for nothing
Im not so sure of that was slowly and thoughtfully responded Not
if one of Uncle Sams officers should get a look into the hold of this
ship
Youre a Mexican anyhow said Captain Kemp surlily You know enough
to keep your mouth shut You dont really have to know anything about
the cargo Besides it was peace when we sailed We shall make a safe
landingif nothing happens on the way
Captain said the Mexican it does not take long to make a
declaration of war when both sides are determined to have one
Youre wrong there Senor Zuroaga replied the captain emphatically
Mexico doesnt want a brush with the States She isnt strong enough
The Yankees can whip her out of Texas any day
That is not the point at all replied Zuroaga sadly The fact is
the Texan Yankees want a war for revenge and the American party in
power would like to annex a great deal more than Texas President
Paredes needs a war to keep himself in power and help him put on a
crown Old Santa Anna wants a war to give him a chance to return from
exile and get control of the army If we ever do reach Vera Cruz we
shall hear of fighting when we get there
Perhaps said the captain but it will be only a short war and at
the end of it the United States will have stolen Texas
No senor said Zuroaga with a fierce flash in his eyes All
educated Mexicans believe that Texas or any other of the old Spanish
provinces has a right to set up for itself Almost every State has
actually tried it We have had revolution after revolution
Anarchy after anarchy growled the captain Such a nation as that
needs a king of some kind or else the strong hand of either England or
France or the United States
Mexico A nation exclaimed Senor Zuroaga after a moment of silence
We are not a nation yet Within our boundaries there are several
millions of ignorant Indians peons rancheros and the like that are
owned rather than ruled by a few scores of rich landholders who
represent the old Spanish military grants Just now President Paredes is
able to overawe as many of these chiefs as he and others have not
murdered So he is President or whatever else he may choose to call
himself The mere title is nothing for the people do not know the
difference between one and another Now Captain Kemp one sure thing is
that the Yankees have taken Texas and mean to keep it They will fight
for it One other sure thing is that General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna
will come back if he can to carry on that war and supersede Paredes
If he does so there is danger ahead for some men He will settle with
all his old enemies and he loves bloodshed for its own sake When he
cannot be killing men he will sit in a cockpit all day just for the
pleasure of seeing the birds slaughtering one another I believe he had
my own father shot quite as much for love of murder as for the
opportunity it gave him for confiscating our family estates in Oaxaca
You seem to have enough to hate him for anyhow and I dont blame
you replied the captain as he turned away to give some orders to the
sailors and all the while the boy who stood near them had been
listening
Well Ned Crawford he muttered to himself thats it is it Father
didnt seem to believe there would be any war He said there would be
plenty of time anyhow for this old Goshawk bark to make the round
trip to New York by way of Vera Cruz
A great lurch of the ship nearly swung him off his feet just then and
he was holding on very firmly to his rope when he added
He said Id learn a great deal all the way and I shouldnt wonder if
Im learning something new just now What do they mean by that
dangerous cargo in the hold and our being captured by American ships of
war Thats a thing father didnt know anything about I guess I can see
how it is though Captain Kemp isnt an American and hed do almost
anything to make money Anything honest I mean How it does blow Well
let her blow Father said he was putting me into a firstrate commercial
school and here I am right in the middle of it
Ned was indeed at school and he seemed likely to have unexpected
teachers but so is every other wideawake young fellow just like
Ulysses Grant and his crowd of young associates in their hot weather war
school over there on the Texas border
Senor Zuroaga also had now walked away and Ned was left to hold by his
rope looking out upon the tossing sea and wondering more and more what
sort of adventures he and the Goshawk might be so swiftly racing on
into
CHAPTER II
THE RACE OF THE GOSHAWK
A long day had passed and a dark night had come The air of it was hot
and sultry over all the regions around the Gulf of Mexico Something
appeared to be weighing it down as if it might be loaded with the great
events which were about to come
It was gloomy enough at and around the besieged American fort on the
Texas side of the Rio Grande but every now and then the darkness and
the silence were broken by the flashes and thunders of the Mexican
artillery and the responses of the cannon of the bravely defended
fortress This was already partly in ruins and the besiegers had good
reasons for their expectation that in due season they were to see the
Stars and Stripes come down from the shattered rampart It did not seem
to them at all possible that the small force under General Taylor
twenty miles away at the seaside could cut through overwhelming
numbers to the relief of the garrison
It was just as dark in the American camp on the coast but there were
many campfires burning and by the light of these and numberless
lanterns there were busy preparations making for the forward march
which was to begin in the morning There was an immense amount of
anxiety in the minds of all the Americans who were getting ready but it
was only on account of the fort and garrison for that little army had a
remarkable degree of confidence in its own fighting capacity
It is never as dark on the land apparently as it is at sea where even
the lights hung out by a ship seem to make all things darker except the
white crests of the billows One ships lantern however was so hung
that it threw down a dim light upon a pair who were sitting on the deck
near the stern
Senor Zuroaga said one of them I wish it was daylight
So do I responded his companion with hardly a trace of foreign
accent The storms nearly over but I had so much on my mind that I
could not sleep The fact is I came up to try and make up my mind where
we are I must reach Vera Cruz before Santa Anna does if I can If I
do not I may be shot after landing I shall be safer too after
President Paredes has marched with his army for the Rio Grande So I
hope for war Anyhow the commander at Vera Cruz is a friend of mine
I guess I understand said Ned I heard what you said about the way
things are going But what did you mean about our being in the Nicholas
Channel What has that got to do with it
Talk Spanish replied the senor with whom the boy appeared to be upon
good terms I do not want any of those sailors to understand me though
Im very glad that you can How did that happen
Well said Ned fathers been all his life in the Cuban and Mexican
trade and Im to grow up into it I cant remember just when they began
to teach me Spanish I was thinking about the war though If its
coming I want to see some of the fighting
You may see more than you will like said his friend in his own
tongue Now as to where we are remember your geography
I can remember every map in it said Ned confidently
Good said the senor Now You know that the Gulf Stream runs along
the coast of Florida Our road from Liverpool to the gulf was to have
taken us by that way Instead of that we came around below the Bahama
Islands and here we are off the north coast of Cuba Captain Kemps
reason is that there might be too many American cruisers along the
Florida coast and he does not care to be stopped by one of them if the
war has already begun We would not be allowed to go any further
I see said Ned Of course not They would stop us to keep us from
being captured by the Mexicans when we got to Vera Cruz
Not exactly said the senor half laughing but it might cost your
father and his partners their ship and cargo That is the secret the
sailors are not to know Away up northward there a hundred miles or so
are the Florida Keys and among them is the United States naval station
at Key West There are ships of war there and Captain Kemp will not
sail any nearer to them than he can help Ned did you have any idea
that you were sitting over a Mexican powdermagazine
No exclaimed Ned What on earth do you mean
I think I had better tell you said the senor I half suspected it
before we sailed and I learned the whole truth afterward The New York
and Liverpool firm that your father belongs to sent on board an honest
and peaceable cargo but there was a good deal of room left in the hold
and the captain filled it up with cannonballs musketbullets and
gunpowder from the English agents of no less a man than General Santa
Anna himself It is all for his army whenever he gets one but it goes
first to the castle of San Juan de Ulua at Vera Cruz If war has been
declared or if it has in any way begun the whole thing is what they
call contraband of war and the Goshawk is liable to be captured and
confiscated
Phew whistled Ned Wonder how fatherd like that Anyhow we dont
know theres any war
Wed be in trouble anyhow said the senor But we are all in the dark
about it We have been over three weeks on the way and all the war news
we had when we started was nearly a month old We can only guess what
has been going on Here we are though in a storm that is driving us
along firstrate into the Gulf of Mexico We may be four days sail from
Vera Cruz in a beeline and the Goshawk is a racer but we may not be
able to make a straight course Well well the captain will keep on all
the canvas thats safe and we may get there Hullo the day is
beginning to dawn Now our real danger begins
He said no more and Ned walked forward with something altogether new on
his mind An American boy crammed full of patriotism and wishing that
he were in General Taylors army he was nevertheless by no fault of
his own one of the crew of a ship which was carrying ammunition to the
enemy He almost felt as if he were fighting his own country and it
made him sick He had an idea moreover that Senor Zuroaga was only
half willing to help his old enemy Santa Anna
I dont care if Captain Kemp is an Englishman he said to himself he
had no business to run father and his partners into such a scrape
That might be so and perhaps neither Kemp nor Zuroaga nor even Ned
himself knew all about the laws of war which govern such cases but
just then there flashed across his mind a very dismal suggestion as he
stared down at the deck he stood on
What he asked himself if any accident should touch off those
barrels of powder down there Why wed all be blown skyhigh and
nobodyd ever know what had become of us Thered be nothing but chips
left
He tried not to think about that and went below to get his breakfast
while Captain Kemp ordered his sailors to send up another sail
remarking to Senor Zuroaga
We must make the most we can of this wind Every hour counts now Ill
take the Goshawk to Vera Cruz or Ill run her under water
Have you any idea where we are just now asked the senor
Well on into the gulf said the captain cheerfully We made a
splendid run in the night thanks to the gale I hope it will blow on
and I think there is no danger of our being overhauled until we are off
the Mexican coast I wish though that I knew whether or not the war
has actually been declared
The declaration isnt everything replied the senor If there has
been any fighting at all American cruisers have a right after that
to question ships bound for a hostile port and to stop and seize all
contraband of war After goods are once seized it isnt easy to get
them back again
Sail ho came down from aloft at that moment
Where away called back the captain
Northerly sir Looks like a shark sir
Can you make out her flag was inquired almost anxiously
The man on the lookout plied his telescope a full halfminute before he
responded
Stars and Stripes sir Sloopowar sir Shes changin her course
and shes makin for us I reckon
Let her head growled the captain This barkll bear more sail Hoist
away there men Let her have it Senor theres one thing Ill do right
off It may be our best chance if she should overhaul us
He did not explain his meaning just then but another sail went up and
something else came down In a few minutes more when Ned came on deck
again he suddenly felt worse than ever Not long before when the sun
was rising he had been on an American ship with the flag of his
country flying above him but now his first glance aloft drew from him a
loud exclamation for he found that while below he had apparently been
turned into an Englishman and away up yonder the gale was playing with
the Red Cross banner of the British Empire He stared at it for a
moment and then he made an excited rush for Senor Zuroaga He might
have reached him sooner but for a lurch of the Goshawk which sent
him sprawling full length upon the deck It did not hurt him much
however and as soon as he was on his feet he blurted out angrily
Senor I say Do you see that What does it mean
The Mexican laughed aloud but not only Ned Crawford but several of the
sailors were eyeing that unexpected bunting with red and angry faces
They also were Americans and they had national prejudices
You dont like the British flag eh he said I do then just now
An American cruiser would not fire a shot at that flag half so quick as
it would at your own
Why wouldnt she asked Ned
Illustration DO YOU SEE THAT WHAT DOES IT MEAN
Because said the senor a little dryly the American skipper hasnt
any British navy behind him ready to take the matter up Its a
protection in case we cant outrun that sloopofwar The men wont care
a cent as soon as they know its only a sea dodge to get into port
with
Sailorlike they were indeed easily satisfied with whatever the captain
chose to tell them and on went the Goshawk as a British craft but
she was nevertheless carrying supplies to the Mexican army
Senor Zuroaga had brought up a double spyglass of his own and after
studying the stranger through it he handed it to Ned remarking
Take a look at her Shes a beauty She is drawing nearer on this tack
but nobody knows yet whether she can outrun us or not
Ned took the glass with an unexpected feeling growing within him that he
hoped she could not do so He did not wish to be caught on board a
British vessel taking powder and shot to kill Americans with As he put
the glass to his eyes however the sloopofwar appeared to have
suddenly come nearer It was as if the Goshawk were already within
reach of her guns and she became a dangerous thing to look at She was
not as yet under any great press of canvas for her commander may not
have imagined that any merchant vessel would try to get away from him
There were two things however about which nobody on board the
Goshawk was thinking The first was that while the American
shipofwar captain had not heard the firing at the fort on the Rio
Grande he was under a strong impression that war had been declared The
other thing came out in a remark which he made to a junior officer
standing by him
It wont do he declared emphatically I dont at all like that
change of flags It means mischief There is something suspicious about
that craft We must bring her to and find out whats the matter with
her
The distance between the two vessels was still too great for anything
but a few signals to which Captain Kemp responded with others which may
have been of his own invention for the signal officer on board the
Yankee cruiser could make nothing of them The Goshhawk moreover did
not shorten sail and her steersman kept her away several points more
southerly instead of bringing her course nearer to that of the cruiser
I see said her captain as he watched the change She means to get
away from us It wont do As soon as we are within range Ill give
her a gun She may be a Mexican privateer for all I know
At all events under the circumstances as he thought the change of
flags had made it his duty to inquire into her character and he decided
to do so even if as he said he should have to send one shot ahead of
her and then a dozen into her
There is something wonderfully exciting about a race of any kind Men
will make use of anything from a donkey to a steamboat to engineer a
trial of speed and endurance Then they will stand around and watch the
running as if the future welfare of the human race depended upon the
result Even the Goshhawk sailors who had previously grumbled at the
British flag above them were entirely reconciled to the situation now
that it included the interesting question whether or not their swift
bark could show her heels to the cruiser They were very much in doubt
about it for the ships of the American navy had a high and wellearned
reputation as chasers They might have been somewhat encouraged if they
had known that the Portsmouth sloopofwar had been at sea a long
time without going into any dock to have her bottom scraped clean of its
accumulated barnacles She was by no means in the best of training for
a marine racecourse
An hour went by and then another The two vessels were now running on
almost parallel lines so that any attempt of the sloop to draw nearer
cost her just so much of chasing distance It might be that they were
in fact nearly matched now that the wind had lulled a little and both
of them were able to send up more canvas without too much risk of having
their sticks blown out of them It looked like it but the Yankee
captain had yet another idea in his sagacious head
Let her keep on he said The old Kennebec is out there somewhere
westerly not far away That vagabond may find himself under heavier
guns than ours before sunset Lieutenant give him a gun
Ay ay sir came back and in a moment more there was a flash and a
report at the bow of the Portsmouth
Both range and distance had been well calculated for an iron messenger
ordering the Goshhawk to heave to fell into the water within a hundred
yards of her stern
Thats near enough for the present said the American commander but
Captain Kemp exclaimed in astonishment
They are firing on the British flag are they Then there is something
up that we dont know anything about We must get away at all risks
They were not doing so just now although another change of course and a
strong puff of the gale carried the Goshhawk further out of range The
fact was that her pursuer did not feel quite ready to land shot on board
of her believing that he was doing well enough and that his prize would
surely be taken sooner or later Besides if she were indeed to become
a prize no soundminded seacaptain could be willing to shoot away her
selling value or that of her cargo
Noon came and there did not appear to be any important change in the
relative positions of the two ships At times indeed the Goshhawk had
gained a quartermile or so but only to lose it again as is apt to be
the case in ocean races She was not at all tired however and both of
the contestants had all the wind they needed
Two hours more went slowly by and Captain Kemp began to exhibit signs
of uneasiness at the unexpected persistence with which he was followed
What on earth can be the matter he remarked aloud Id have thought
shed get tired of it before this
Captain sharply interrupted Zuroaga standing at his elbow glass in
hand Another sail Off there southerly Seems to be a fullrigged
ship What are we to do now
Keep on roared the captain and then he turned to respond to a
similar piece of unpleasant information which came down from the
lookout
Well soon know what she is he remarked but not as if he very much
wished to do so What Id like to do would be to sail on into the
darkest kind of a rainy night Thats our chance if we can get it
It might be but at that very moment the commander of the Portsmouth
was asserting to his first lieutenant
There comes the Kennebec my boy Well have this fellow now Well
teach him not to play tricks with national flags and manowar
signals
The race across the Gulf of Mexico was now putting on new and
interesting features but Ned Crawford posted well forward to watch the
course of events and what might have been called the racecourse sagely
remarked
I dont know that two horses can run any faster than one can We are as
far ahead as ever we were
That would have been of more importance if the newcomer had not been so
much to the southward and westward rather than behind them She was of
course several miles nearer to the Goshhawk than she was to the
Portsmouth and neither of these had as yet been able to make out her
flag with certainty That she was a fullrigged ship was sure enough
and if Ned had been upon her deck instead of upon his own he would have
discovered that she was heavily armed and in applepie order At this
very moment a burly officer upon her quarterdeck was roaring angrily
in response to some information which had been given him
Whats that A British ship chased by a Yankee cruiser Lieutenant I
think the Falconll take a look at that These Yankees are getting too
bumptious altogether Its as if they thought they owned the gulf Put
her head two points northard Humph Its about time they had a
lesson
There had been some temporary trouble with the flag of the Falcon but
it had now been cleared of its tangle and was swinging out free It was
of larger size than the British bunting displayed by the Goshawk It was
only a few minutes therefore before Captain Kemp had a fresh trouble
on his mind for his telescope had told him the meaning of that flag
Worse than ever he exclaimed Shed make us heave to and show our
papers Then shed hand us right over and no help for it No sir Our
only way is to scud from both of them Some of our English frigates are
slow goers and this may be one of that kind
He was in less immediate peril perhaps because of the determination of
the angry British captain to speak to the Yankee first and demand an
explanation of this extraordinary affair This it was his plain duty to
do and the attempt to do it would shortly put him and all his guns
between the Portsmouth and the Goshhawk This operation was going on
