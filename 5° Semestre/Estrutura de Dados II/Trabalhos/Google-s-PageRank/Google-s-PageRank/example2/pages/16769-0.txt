VIII THE ROMANCE OF ORTHODOXY   228
IX AUTHORITY AND THE ADVENTURER   259
ORTHODOXY
CHAPTER IIntroduction in Defence of Everything Else
The only possible excuse for this book is that it is an answer to a
challenge Even a bad shot is dignified when he accepts a duel When
some time ago I published a series of hasty but sincere papers under
the name of Heretics several critics for whose intellect I have a
warm respect I may mention specially Mr GS Street said that it was
all very well for me to tell everybody to affirm his cosmic theory but
that I had carefully avoided supporting my precepts with example I
will begin to worry about my philosophy said Mr Street when Mr
Chesterton has given us his It was perhaps an incautious suggestion to
make to a person only too ready to write books upon the feeblest
provocation But after all though Mr Street has inspired and created
this book he need not read it If he does read it he will find that in
its pages I have attempted in a vague and personal way in a set of
mental pictures rather than in a series of deductions to state the
philosophy in which I have come to believe I will not call it my
philosophy for I did not make it God and humanity made it and it made
me
I have often had a fancy for writing a romance about an English
yachtsman who slightly miscalculated his course and discovered England
under the impression that it was a new island in the South Seas I
always find however that I am either too busy or too lazy to write
this fine work so I may as well give it away for the purposes of
philosophical illustration There will probably be a general impression
that the man who landed armed to the teeth and talking by signs to
plant the British flag on that barbaric temple which turned out to be
the Pavilion at Brighton felt rather a fool I am not here concerned to
deny that he looked a fool But if you imagine that he felt a fool or
at any rate that the sense of folly was his sole or his dominant
emotion then you have not studied with sufficient delicacy the rich
romantic nature of the hero of this tale His mistake was really a most
enviable mistake and he knew it if he was the man I take him for What
could be more delightful than to have in the same few minutes all the
fascinating terrors of going abroad combined with all the humane
security of coming home again What could be better than to have all
the fun of discovering South Africa without the disgusting necessity of
landing there What could be more glorious than to brace ones self up
to discover New South Wales and then realize with a gush of happy
tears that it was really old South Wales This at least seems to me the
main problem for philosophers and is in a manner the main problem of
this book How can we contrive to be at once astonished at the world and
yet at home in it How can this queer cosmic town with its manylegged
citizens with its monstrous and ancient lamps how can this world give
us at once the fascination of a strange town and the comfort and honour
of being our own town To show that a faith or a philosophy is true from
every standpoint would be too big an undertaking even for a much bigger
book than this it is necessary to follow one path of argument and this
is the path that I here propose to follow I wish to set forth my faith
as particularly answering this double spiritual need the need for that
mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar which Christendom has rightly
named romance For the very word romance has in it the mystery and
ancient meaning of Rome Any one setting out to dispute anything ought
always to begin by saying what he does not dispute Beyond stating what
he proposes to prove he should always state what he does not propose to
prove The thing I do not propose to prove the thing I propose to take
as common ground between myself and any average reader is this
desirability of an active and imaginative life picturesque and full of
a poetical curiosity a life such as western man at any rate always
seems to have desired If a man says that extinction is better than
existence or blank existence better than variety and adventure then he
is not one of the ordinary people to whom I am talking If a man prefers
nothing I can give him nothing But nearly all people I have ever met in
this western society in which I live would agree to the general
proposition that we need this life of practical romance the combination
of something that is strange with something that is secure We need so
to view the world as to combine an idea of wonder and an idea of
welcome We need to be happy in this wonderland without once being
merely comfortable It is this achievement of my creed that I shall
chiefly pursue in these pages
But I have a peculiar reason for mentioning the man in a yacht who
discovered England For I am that man in a yacht I discovered England
I do not see how this book can avoid being egotistical and I do not
quite see to tell the truth how it can avoid being dull Dullness
will however free me from the charge which I most lament the charge
of being flippant Mere light sophistry is the thing that I happen to
despise most of all things and it is perhaps a wholesome fact that this
is the thing of which I am generally accused I know nothing so
contemptible as a mere paradox a mere ingenious defence of the
indefensible If it were true as has been said that Mr Bernard Shaw
lived upon paradox then he ought to be a mere common millionaire for a
man of his mental activity could invent a sophistry every six minutes
It is as easy as lying because it is lying The truth is of course
that Mr Shaw is cruelly hampered by the fact that he cannot tell any
lie unless he thinks it is the truth I find myself under the same
intolerable bondage I never in my life said anything merely because I
thought it funny though of course I have had ordinary human
vainglory and may have thought it funny because I had said it It is
one thing to describe an interview with a gorgon or a griffin a
creature who does not exist It is another thing to discover that the
rhinoceros does exist and then take pleasure in the fact that he looks
as if he didnt One searches for truth but it may be that one pursues
instinctively the more extraordinary truths And I offer this book with
the heartiest sentiments to all the jolly people who hate what I write
and regard it very justly for all I know as a piece of poor clowning
or a single tiresome joke
For if this book is a joke it is a joke against me I am the man who
with the utmost daring discovered what had been discovered before If
there is an element of farce in what follows the farce is at my own
expense for this book explains how I fancied I was the first to set
foot in Brighton and then found I was the last It recounts my
elephantine adventures in pursuit of the obvious No one can think my
case more ludicrous than I think it myself no reader can accuse me here
of trying to make a fool of him I am the fool of this story and no
rebel shall hurl me from my throne I freely confess all the idiotic
ambitions of the end of the nineteenth century I did like all other
solemn little boys try to be in advance of the age Like them I tried
to be some ten minutes in advance of the truth And I found that I was
eighteen hundred years behind it I did strain my voice with a painfully
juvenile exaggeration in uttering my truths And I was punished in the
fittest and funniest way for I have kept my truths but I have
discovered not that they were not truths but simply that they were not
mine When I fancied that I stood alone I was really in the ridiculous
position of being backed up by all Christendom It may be Heaven
forgive me that I did try to be original but I only succeeded in
inventing all by myself an inferior copy of the existing traditions of
civilized religion The man from the yacht thought he was the first to
find England I thought I was the first to find Europe I did try to
found a heresy of my own and when I had put the last touches to it I
discovered that it was orthodoxy
It may be that somebody will be entertained by the account of this happy
fiasco It might amuse a friend or an enemy to read how I gradually
learnt from the truth of some stray legend or from the falsehood of some
dominant philosophy things that I might have learnt from my
catechismif I had ever learnt it There may or may not be some
entertainment in reading how I found at last in an anarchist club or a
Babylonian temple what I might have found in the nearest parish church
If any one is entertained by learning how the flowers of the field or
the phrases in an omnibus the accidents of politics or the pains of
youth came together in a certain order to produce a certain conviction
of Christian orthodoxy he may possibly read this book But there is in
everything a reasonable division of labour I have written the book and
nothing on earth would induce me to read it
I add one purely pedantic note which comes as a note naturally should
at the beginning of the book These essays are concerned only to discuss
the actual fact that the central Christian theology sufficiently
summarized in the Apostles Creed is the best root of energy and sound
ethics They are not intended to discuss the very fascinating but quite
different question of what is the present seat of authority for the
proclamation of that creed When the word orthodoxy is used here it
means the Apostles Creed as understood by everybody calling himself
Christian until a very short time ago and the general historic conduct
of those who held such a creed I have been forced by mere space to
confine myself to what I have got from this creed I do not touch the
matter much disputed among modern Christians of where we ourselves got
it This is not an ecclesiastical treatise but a sort of slovenly
autobiography But if any one wants my opinions about the actual nature
of the authority Mr GS Street has only to throw me another
challenge and I will write him another book
CHAPTER IIThe Maniac
Thoroughly worldly people never understand even the world they rely
altogether on a few cynical maxims which are not true Once I remember
walking with a prosperous publisher who made a remark which I had often
heard before it is indeed almost a motto of the modern world Yet I
had heard it once too often and I saw suddenly that there was nothing
in it The publisher said of somebody That man will get on he
believes in himself And I remember that as I lifted my head to listen
my eye caught an omnibus on which was written Hanwell I said to him
Shall I tell you where the men are who believe most in themselves For
I can tell you I know of men who believe in themselves more colossally
than Napoleon or Caesar I know where flames the fixed star of certainty
and success I can guide you to the thrones of the Supermen The men
who really believe in themselves are all in lunatic asylums He said
mildly that there were a good many men after all who believed in
themselves and who were not in lunatic asylums Yes there are I
retorted and you of all men ought to know them That drunken poet from
whom you would not take a dreary tragedy he believed in himself That
elderly minister with an epic from whom you were hiding in a back room
he believed in himself If you consulted your business experience
instead of your ugly individualistic philosophy you would know that
believing in himself is one of the commonest signs of a rotter Actors
who cant act believe in themselves and debtors who wont pay It would
be much truer to say that a man will certainly fail because he believes
in himself Complete selfconfidence is not merely a sin complete
selfconfidence is a weakness Believing utterly in ones self is a
hysterical and superstitious belief like believing in Joanna Southcote
the man who has it has Hanwell written on his face as plain as it is
written on that omnibus And to all this my friend the publisher made
this very deep and effective reply Well if a man is not to believe in
himself in what is he to believe After a long pause I replied I
will go home and write a book in answer to that question This is the
book that I have written in answer to it
But I think this book may well start where our argument startedin the
neighbourhood of the madhouse Modern masters of science are much
impressed with the need of beginning all inquiry with a fact The
ancient masters of religion were quite equally impressed with that
necessity They began with the fact of sina fact as practical as
potatoes Whether or no man could be washed in miraculous waters there
was no doubt at any rate that he wanted washing But certain religious
leaders in London not mere materialists have begun in our day not to
deny the highly disputable water but to deny the indisputable dirt
Certain new theologians dispute original sin which is the only part of
Christian theology which can really be proved Some followers of the
Reverend RJ Campbell in their almost too fastidious spirituality
admit divine sinlessness which they cannot see even in their dreams
But they essentially deny human sin which they can see in the street
The strongest saints and the strongest sceptics alike took positive evil
as the startingpoint of their argument If it be true as it certainly
is that a man can feel exquisite happiness in skinning a cat then the
religious philosopher can only draw one of two deductions He must
either deny the existence of God as all atheists do or he must deny
the present union between God and man as all Christians do The new
theologians seem to think it a highly rationalistic solution to deny the
cat
In this remarkable situation it is plainly not now possible with any
hope of a universal appeal to start as our fathers did with the fact
of sin This very fact which was to them and is to me as plain as a
pikestaff is the very fact that has been specially diluted or denied
But though moderns deny the existence of sin I do not think that they
have yet denied the existence of a lunatic asylum We all agree still
that there is a collapse of the intellect as unmistakable as a falling
house Men deny hell but not as yet Hanwell For the purpose of our
primary argument the one may very well stand where the other stood I
mean that as all thoughts and theories were once judged by whether they
tended to make a man lose his soul so for our present purpose all
modern thoughts and theories may be judged by whether they tend to make
a man lose his wits
It is true that some speak lightly and loosely of insanity as in itself
attractive But a moments thought will show that if disease is
beautiful it is generally some one elses disease A blind man may be
picturesque but it requires two eyes to see the picture And similarly
even the wildest poetry of insanity can only be enjoyed by the sane To
the insane man his insanity is quite prosaic because it is quite true
A man who thinks himself a chicken is to himself as ordinary as a
chicken A man who thinks he is a bit of glass is to himself as dull as
a bit of glass It is the homogeneity of his mind which makes him dull
and which makes him mad It is only because we see the irony of his idea
that we think him even amusing it is only because he does not see the
irony of his idea that he is put in Hanwell at all In short oddities
only strike ordinary people Oddities do not strike odd people This is
why ordinary people have a much more exciting time while odd people are
always complaining of the dulness of life This is also why the new
novels die so quickly and why the old fairy tales endure for ever The
old fairy tale makes the hero a normal human boy it is his adventures
that are startling they startle him because he is normal But in the
modern psychological novel the hero is abnormal the centre is not
central Hence the fiercest adventures fail to affect him adequately
and the book is monotonous You can make a story out of a hero among
dragons but not out of a dragon among dragons The fairy tale discusses
what a sane man will do in a mad world The sober realistic novel of
today discusses what an essential lunatic will do in a dull world
Let us begin then with the madhouse from this evil and fantastic inn
let us set forth on our intellectual journey Now if we are to glance
at the philosophy of sanity the first thing to do in the matter is to
blot out one big and common mistake There is a notion adrift everywhere
that imagination especially mystical imagination is dangerous to mans
mental balance Poets are commonly spoken of as psychologically
unreliable and generally there is a vague association between wreathing
laurels in your hair and sticking straws in it Facts and history
utterly contradict this view Most of the very great poets have been not
only sane but extremely businesslike and if Shakespeare ever really
held horses it was because he was much the safest man to hold them
Imagination does not breed insanity Exactly what does breed insanity is
reason Poets do not go mad but chessplayers do Mathematicians go
mad and cashiers but creative artists very seldom I am not as will
be seen in any sense attacking logic I only say that this danger does
lie in logic not in imagination Artistic paternity is as wholesome as
physical paternity Moreover it is worthy of remark that when a poet
really was morbid it was commonly because he had some weak spot of
rationality on his brain Poe for instance really was morbid not
because he was poetical but because he was specially analytical Even
chess was too poetical for him he disliked chess because it was full of
knights and castles like a poem He avowedly preferred the black discs
of draughts because they were more like the mere black dots on a
diagram Perhaps the strongest case of all is this that only one great
English poet went mad Cowper And he was definitely driven mad by
logic by the ugly and alien logic of predestination Poetry was not the
disease but the medicine poetry partly kept him in health He could
sometimes forget the red and thirsty hell to which his hideous
necessitarianism dragged him among the wide waters and the white flat
lilies of the Ouse He was damned by John Calvin he was almost saved by
John Gilpin Everywhere we see that men do not go mad by dreaming
Critics are much madder than poets Homer is complete and calm enough
it is his critics who tear him into extravagant tatters Shakespeare is
quite himself it is only some of his critics who have discovered that
he was somebody else And though St John the Evangelist saw many
strange monsters in his vision he saw no creature so wild as one of his
own commentators The general fact is simple Poetry is sane because it
floats easily in an infinite sea reason seeks to cross the infinite
sea and so make it finite The result is mental exhaustion like the
physical exhaustion of Mr Holbein To accept everything is an exercise
to understand everything a strain The poet only desires exaltation and
expansion a world to stretch himself in The poet only asks to get his
head into the heavens It is the logician who seeks to get the heavens
into his head And it is his head that splits
It is a small matter but not irrelevant that this striking mistake is
commonly supported by a striking misquotation We have all heard people
cite the celebrated line of Dryden as Great genius is to madness near
allied But Dryden did not say that great genius was to madness near
allied Dryden was a great genius himself and knew better It would
have been hard to find a man more romantic than he or more sensible
What Dryden said was this Great wits are oft to madness near allied
and that is true It is the pure promptitude of the intellect that is in
peril of a breakdown Also people might remember of what sort of man
Dryden was talking He was not talking of any unworldly visionary like
Vaughan or George Herbert He was talking of a cynical man of the world
a sceptic a diplomatist a great practical politician Such men are
indeed to madness near allied Their incessant calculation of their own
brains and other peoples brains is a dangerous trade It is always
perilous to the mind to reckon up the mind A flippant person has asked
why we say As mad as a hatter A more flippant person might answer
that a hatter is mad because he has to measure the human head
And if great reasoners are often maniacal it is equally true that
maniacs are commonly great reasoners When I was engaged in a
controversy with the Clarion on the matter of free will that able
writer Mr RB Suthers said that free will was lunacy because it meant
causeless actions and the actions of a lunatic would be causeless I do
not dwell here upon the disastrous lapse in determinist logic Obviously
if any actions even a lunatics can be causeless determinism is done
for If the chain of causation can be broken for a madman it can be
broken for a man But my purpose is to point out something more
practical It was natural perhaps that a modern Marxian Socialist
should not know anything about free will But it was certainly
remarkable that a modern Marxian Socialist should not know anything
about lunatics Mr Suthers evidently did not know anything about
lunatics The last thing that can be said of a lunatic is that his
actions are causeless If any human acts may loosely be called
causeless they are the minor acts of a healthy man whistling as he
walks slashing the grass with a stick kicking his heels or rubbing his
hands It is the happy man who does the useless things the sick man is
not strong enough to be idle It is exactly such careless and causeless
actions that the madman could never understand for the madman like the
determinist generally sees too much cause in everything The madman
would read a conspiratorial significance into those empty activities He
would think that the lopping of the grass was an attack on private
property He would think that the kicking of the heels was a signal to
an accomplice If the madman could for an instant become careless he
would become sane Every one who has had the misfortune to talk with
people in the heart or on the edge of mental disorder knows that their
most sinister quality is a horrible clarity of detail a connecting of
one thing with another in a map more elaborate than a maze If you argue
with a madman it is extremely probable that you will get the worst of
it for in many ways his mind moves all the quicker for not being
delayed by the things that go with good judgment He is not hampered by
a sense of humour or by charity or by the dumb certainties of
experience He is the more logical for losing certain sane affections
Indeed the common phrase for insanity is in this respect a misleading
one The madman is not the man who has lost his reason The madman is
the man who has lost everything except his reason
The madmans explanation of a thing is always complete and often in a
purely rational sense satisfactory Or to speak more strictly the
insane explanation if not conclusive is at least unanswerable this
may be observed specially in the two or three commonest kinds of
madness If a man says for instance that men have a conspiracy against
him you cannot dispute it except by saying that all the men deny that
they are conspirators which is exactly what conspirators would do His
explanation covers the facts as much as yours Or if a man says that he
is the rightful King of England it is no complete answer to say that
the existing authorities call him mad for if he were King of England
that might be the wisest thing for the existing authorities to do Or if
a man says that he is Jesus Christ it is no answer to tell him that the
world denies his divinity for the world denied Christs
Nevertheless he is wrong But if we attempt to trace his error in exact
terms we shall not find it quite so easy as we had supposed Perhaps
the nearest we can get to expressing it is to say this that his mind
moves in a perfect but narrow circle A small circle is quite as
infinite as a large circle but though it is quite as infinite it is
not so large In the same way the insane explanation is quite as
complete as the sane one but it is not so large A bullet is quite as
round as the world but it is not the world There is such a thing as a
narrow universality there is such a thing as a small and cramped
eternity you may see it in many modern religions Now speaking quite
externally and empirically we may say that the strongest and most
unmistakable mark of madness is this combination between a logical
completeness and a spiritual contraction The lunatics theory explains
a large number of things but it does not explain them in a large way I
mean that if you or I were dealing with a mind that was growing morbid
we should be chiefly concerned not so much to give it arguments as to
give it air to convince it that there was something cleaner and cooler
outside the suffocation of a single argument Suppose for instance it
were the first case that I took as typical suppose it were the case of
a man who accused everybody of conspiring against him If we could
express our deepest feelings of protest and appeal against this
obsession I suppose we should say something like this Oh I admit
that you have your case and have it by heart and that many things do
fit into other things as you say I admit that your explanation explains
a great deal but what a great deal it leaves out Are there no other
stories in the world except yours and are all men busy with your
business Suppose we grant the details perhaps when the man in the
street did not seem to see you it was only his cunning perhaps when the
policeman asked you your name it was only because he knew it already
But how much happier you would be if you only knew that these people
cared nothing about you How much larger your life would be if your self
could become smaller in it if you could really look at other men with
common curiosity and pleasure if you could see them walking as they are
in their sunny selfishness and their virile indifference You would
begin to be interested in them because they were not interested in you
You would break out of this tiny and tawdry theatre in which your own
little plot is always being played and you would find yourself under a
freer sky in a street full of splendid strangers Or suppose it were
the second case of madness that of a man who claims the crown your
impulse would be to answer All right Perhaps you know that you are
the King of England but why do you care Make one magnificent effort
and you will be a human being and look down on all the kings of the
earth Or it might be the third case of the madman who called himself
Christ If we said what we felt we should say So you are the Creator
and Redeemer of the world but what a small world it must be What a
little heaven you must inhabit with angels no bigger than butterflies
How sad it must be to be God and an inadequate God Is there really no
life fuller and no love more marvellous than yours and is it really in
your small and painful pity that all flesh must put its faith How much
happier you would be how much more of you there would be if the hammer
of a higher God could smash your small cosmos scattering the stars like
spangles and leave you in the open free like other men to look up as
well as down
And it must be remembered that the most purely practical science does
take this view of mental evil it does not seek to argue with it like a
heresy but simply to snap it like a spell Neither modern science nor
ancient religion believes in complete free thought Theology rebukes
certain thoughts by calling them blasphemous Science rebukes certain
thoughts by calling them morbid For example some religious societies
discouraged men more or less from thinking about sex The new scientific
society definitely discourages men from thinking about death it is a
fact but it is considered a morbid fact And in dealing with those
whose morbidity has a touch of mania modern science cares far less for
pure logic than a dancing Dervish In these cases it is not enough that
the unhappy man should desire truth he must desire health Nothing can
save him but a blind hunger for normality like that of a beast A man
cannot think himself out of mental evil for it is actually the organ of
thought that has become diseased ungovernable and as it were
independent He can only be saved by will or faith The moment his mere
reason moves it moves in the old circular rut he will go round and
round his logical circle just as a man in a thirdclass carriage on the
Inner Circle will go round and round the Inner Circle unless he performs
the voluntary vigorous and mystical act of getting out at Gower
Street Decision is the whole business here a door must be shut for
ever Every remedy is a desperate remedy Every cure is a miraculous
cure Curing a madman is not arguing with a philosopher it is casting
out a devil And however quietly doctors and psychologists may go to
work in the matter their attitude is profoundly intolerantas
intolerant as Bloody Mary Their attitude is really this that the man
must stop thinking if he is to go on living Their counsel is one of
intellectual amputation If thy head offend thee cut it off for it
is better not merely to enter the Kingdom of Heaven as a child but to
enter it as an imbecile rather than with your whole intellect to be
cast into hellor into Hanwell
Such is the madman of experience he is commonly a reasoner frequently
a successful reasoner Doubtless he could be vanquished in mere reason
and the case against him put logically But it can be put much more
precisely in more general and even Asthetic terms He is in the clean
and welllit prison of one idea he is sharpened to one painful point
He is without healthy hesitation and healthy complexity Now as I
explain in the introduction I have determined in these early chapters
to give not so much a diagram of a doctrine as some pictures of a point
of view And I have described at length my vision of the maniac for this
reason that just as I am affected by the maniac so I am affected by
most modern thinkers That unmistakable mood or note that I hear from
Hanwell I hear also from half the chairs of science and seats of
learning today and most of the mad doctors are mad doctors in more
senses than one They all have exactly that combination we have noted
the combination of an expansive and exhaustive reason with a contracted
common sense They are universal only in the sense that they take one
thin explanation and carry it very far But a pattern can stretch for
ever and still be a small pattern They see a chessboard white on
black and if the universe is paved with it it is still white on black
Like the lunatic they cannot alter their standpoint they cannot make a
mental effort and suddenly see it black on white
Take first the more obvious case of materialism As an explanation of
the world materialism has a sort of insane simplicity It has just the
quality of the madmans argument we have at once the sense of it
covering everything and the sense of it leaving everything out
Contemplate some able and sincere materialist as for instance Mr
McCabe and you will have exactly this unique sensation He understands
everything and everything does not seem worth understanding His cosmos
may be complete in every rivet and cogwheel but still his cosmos is
smaller than our world Somehow his scheme like the lucid scheme of the
madman seems unconscious of the alien energies and the large
indifference of the earth it is not thinking of the real things of the
earth of fighting peoples or proud mothers or first love or fear upon
the sea The earth is so very large and the cosmos is so very small
The cosmos is about the smallest hole that a man can hide his head in
It must be understood that I am not now discussing the relation of
these creeds to truth but for the present solely their relation to
health Later in the argument I hope to attack the question of objective
verity here I speak only of a phenomenon of psychology I do not for
the present attempt to prove to Haeckel that materialism is untrue any
more than I attempted to prove to the man who thought he was Christ that
he was labouring under an error I merely remark here on the fact that
both cases have the same kind of completeness and the same kind of
incompleteness You can explain a mans detention at Hanwell by an
indifferent public by saying that it is the crucifixion of a god of whom
the world is not worthy The explanation does explain Similarly you may
explain the order in the universe by saying that all things even the
souls of men are leaves inevitably unfolding on an utterly unconscious
treethe blind destiny of matter The explanation does explain though
not of course so completely as the madmans But the point here is
that the normal human mind not only objects to both but feels to both
the same objection Its approximate statement is that if the man in
Hanwell is the real God he is not much of a god And similarly if the
cosmos of the materialist is the real cosmos it is not much of a
cosmos The thing has shrunk The deity is less divine than many men
and according to Haeckel the whole of life is something much more
grey narrow and trivial than many separate aspects of it The parts
seem greater than the whole
For we must remember that the materialist philosophy whether true or
not is certainly much more limiting than any religion In one sense of
course all intelligent ideas are narrow They cannot be broader than
themselves A Christian is only restricted in the same sense that an
