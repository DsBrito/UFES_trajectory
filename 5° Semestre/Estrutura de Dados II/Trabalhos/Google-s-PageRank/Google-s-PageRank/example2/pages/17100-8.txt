BEATRIX OF CLARE
I
RUDDY TRESSES AND GREY EYES
Two archers stepped out into the pathshafts notched and bows up
A word with your worship said one
The Knight whirled around
A word with your worship greeted him from the rear
He glanced quickly to each side
A word with your worship met him there
He shrugged his shoulders and sat down on the limb of a fallen tree
Resistance was quite useless with no weapon save a dagger and no
armor but silk and velvet
The unanimity of your desires does me much honor he said pray
proceed
The leader lowered his bow
It is a great pleasure to meet you Sir Aymer de Lacy said he and
particularly to be received so graciously
You know me
We saw you arrive yesterdaybut there were so many with you we
hesitated to ask a quiet word aside
The Knight smiled  It is unfortunateI assure you my talk would have
been much more interesting then
In that case it is we who are the losers
De Lacy looked him over carefully
Pardieu man said he your language shames your business
The outlaw bowed with sweeping grace
My thanks my lord my deepest thanks  He unstrung his bow and
leaned upon the stave a fine figure in forest green and velvet bonnet
a black mask over eyes and nose a generous mouth and strong chin below
it  Will your worship favor me with your dagger he said
The Knight tossed it to him
Thank you    a handsome bit of craftsmanship    these stones are
true ones nest ce pas
If they are not I was cheated in the price De Lacy laughed
The other examined it critically
Methinks you were not cheated he said and drew it through his belt
And would your lordship also permit me a closer view of the fine gold
chain that hangs around your neck
De Lacy took it off and flung it over
It I will warrant true he said
The outlaw weighed the links in his hand then bit one testingly
So will I said he and dropped the chain in his pouch
And the ring with the rubyit is a ruby is it notmay I also
examine it     I am very fond of rubies    Thank you you are
most obliging    It seems to be an especially fine stoneand
worth    how many rose nobles would you say my lord
I am truly sorry I cannot aid you there De Lacy answered being
neither a merchant nor a robber I have never reckoned its value
The other smiled  Of course by merchant your worship has no
reference to my good comrades nor myself
None whatever I assure you
Thank you I did not think you would be so discourteous    But
touching money reminds me that doubtless there is some such about
youperhaps you will permit me to count it for you
The Knight drew out a handful of coins  Will you have them one by one
or all together he asked
All together on the turf beside you if you please    Thank
you    And do you know Sir Aymer I am vastly taken with the short
gown of velvet and sableyou brought it from France I assume the
fashion smacks of the Continent  I would like much to have your
opinion as to how it looks on mewe are rather of a size I take
itthough I shall have to forego the pleasure of the opinion until
another day    And now that I can see your doublet I am enamoured
also of itwill you lend it to me for a little while  Truly my lord
I mind never to have seen a handsomer or one that caught my fancy
more
De Lacy looked again at the archers and their ready bows
St Denis fellow he said leave me enough clothes to return to the
castle
God forbid exclaimed the bandit that I should put a gallant
gentleman to any such embarrassmentbut you must admit it were a shame
to have gown and doublet and yet no bonnet to match them
The Knight took it off and sent it spinning toward him
Note the feather he said  It is rarely long and heavy
I observed that yesterday was the merry response
Is there anything else about me you care for De Lacy asked
Nothingunless you could give me your rarely generous disposition
Methinks I never met a more obliging gentleman
The Knight arose  Then as I am already overdue at Windsor I shall
give you good morning
The archer raised his hand
I am sorry my lord but we must impose a trifle further on your good
nature and ask you to remain here a while and he nodded to the man
beside him who drew a thin rope from his pouch and came forward
De Lacy started backthe leveled arrows met him on every side
You would not bind me he exclaimed
The outlaw bowed again
It grieves me to the heart to do it but we have pressing business
elsewhere and must provide against pursuit  Some one will I hope
chance upon you before night    Proceed Jamesyonder beech will
answer
The Knight laughed
I thank you for the hope he saidand throwing his body into the
blow smashed the rogue with the rope straight on the chinpoint and
leaping over him closed with the leader
It was done so quickly and in such positions that the others dared not
shoot lest they strike either James or their chiefbut the struggle
was only for a moment for they sprang in and dragged the Knight away
and whipped the rope about his arms
Marry exclaimed the leader brushing the dirt from his clothes I
am sorry they did not let us have the wrestle outthough you are a
quick hitter my lord and powerful strong in the arms  I wager you
showed James more stars than he ever knew existed
James still dazed was struggling to get up and one of the others
gave him a hand
By St Hubert he growled rubbing his head in pain and scowling at
De Lacy if there be more I have no wish to see them
In the fight De Lacys forearm had struck the point of his own dagger
where it protruded below the brigands belt and the blood was
scarleting the white sleeve of his tunic
The leader came over and bared the wound
It is a clean gash my lord he said but will need a bandage  He
drew a bowcord around the arm above the elbow then With your
permission carefully cut away the sleeve and deftly bound up the hurt
De Lacy watched him curiously
You are a charming outlaw he observed a skillful surgeonand I
fancy if you so cared you could claim a gentle birth
The man stepped back and looked him in the eyes a moment
If I remove the bonds will you give me your Knightly word to remain
here speaking to no one until    the sun has passed the topmost
branch of yonder oak
The Knight bowed
That I will and thank you for the courtesy
At a nod the rope was loosed and the next instant the outlaws had
vanished in the forestbut De Lacys cloak lay at his feet flung
there by the chief himself
St Denis De Lacy marveled has Robin Hood returned to the flesh
Then he looked at the sun and resumed his seat on the fallen tree
A pretty mess he museda stranger in Englandmy first day at
Windsor and the jest of the castle    Stripped like a jowly
tradesman    taken like a cooing babe    purseless
daggerless    bonnetless    doubletlessaye naked but for an
outlaws generosity    cut by my own weaponhe held up his hand
and looked at the abraded knucklesand that is all the credit I have
to showthe mark of a caitiffs chin    Methinks I am fit only for
the company of children
He glanced again at the sunit seemed not to have moved at allthen
sat in moody silence the wound was smarting now and he frowned at it
every time it gave an extra twinge    Would the sun never
move     He got up and paced back and forth his eyes on the oak at
every turntruly that tree was growing higher every minuteor the sun
was sinking    Not that he was in haste to return to Windsor
There would be a fine tale to tell thereno need to speed to itit
would speed to him quite soon enough     But to get away from the
accursed placeanywhere    back to Windsor even    what if some
one found him here in this plightand he not allowed to speakunable
to explaindumb as that oak    Would the sun never move  The wound
was stinging sharply and the arm above the cord was turning black and
swelling fastthe pressure must come off  He felt for his dagger
then flung out an imprecation and tried to tear the cord asunder with
his teeth  It was quite futile it was sunk now so deep in the flesh
he could not seize itand the knots were drawn too tight to loose
Would the sun never move
He fell to searching for a stonea small one with an edge that could
reach in and rasp the deerhide cord apartbut vainly though he tried
many only to leave his arm torn and bleeding    Yet at last the sun
had movedit was up among the thinner branches
Of a sudden back in the forest rose the deep bay of a mastiff
and presently againand nearer    and a third timeand still
nearer    and then down the path came the great tawny dog tail
arched forward head upand behind him a bay horse a woman in the
saddle
Down Rollo down she cried as the mastiff sprang ahead
Beside me sir and the dog whirled instantly and obeyed
De Lacy bethought himself of his cloak and hurrying to where it lay he
tried to fling it around his shoulders but with only one hand and his
haste he managed badly and it slipped off and fell to the ground  As
he seized it again the horse halted behind him
You are wounded sir she said permit me to aid you
He turned slowly bowing as he did sohe dared not speakthen glanced
up and almost spoke in sheer amazement as he beheld the slender
figure in green velvetthe sweet bowshaped mouth the highbred
sensitive nose the rounded chin the tiny ear the soft deep grey
eyes and crowning all the great rolls of the auburn hair that
sunbeams spin to gold
Come sir said she I stopped to aid you not to be stared at
De Lacy flushed and made to speak then checked himself and with
another bow held up his arm and motioned for her to cut the cord
Merciful Mother she exclaimed and severed it with a touch of her
bodkin
The blood flooded fiercely forward and the wound began to bleed afresh
The bandage needs adjustingcome and slipping from saddle she
tossed the rein to the dog and went over to the fallen tree  Sit
down she ordered
With a smile De Lacy obeyed as yet she did not seem to note his
silence  And it was very pleasant indeedthe touch of her slim
fingers on his bare armthe perfume of her hair as she bent over the
workthe quick upward glance at times of her grey eyes questioning if
she hurt him  He was sorry now there were not a dozen wounds for her
to dress
There that will suffice until you get proper attendance she said
tying the last knot and tucking under the ends
He took her hand and bowing would have kissed it but she drew it away
sharply and turned to her horse  Then she stopped and looked at him in
sudden recollection
Parbleu man where is your tongue she demanded  You had one last
night
Where she had seen him he did not know he had not seen herand it
only tangled the matter the more for now she would know he was not
dumb  But how to explain
He smiled and bowed
That is the sixth time I have got a bow when a word was due she
said  There may be a language of genuflections but I do not know it
He bowed again
Seven she counted the perfect numberstop with it
He put his hand to his lips and shook his head in negationthen
pointed to the sun and the tree and shook his head againthen once
more to the sun and slowly upward to the top of the tree and nodded in
affirmation
She watched him with a puzzled frown
Are you trying to tell me why you do not speak she asked
He nodded eagerly
Tell me again    and she studied his motions carefully    The
sun and the treeand the sun and the tree again    is that your
meaning     Ah    the top of the tree     I think I am
beginning to understand     Where is your doublet
De Lacy pointed into the forest
And your bonnet    with your doublet    and your dagger
gone with the others    you mean your ring  and it went with them
too    yes yesI see nowoutlaws and your wound got in the
struggle     She turned toward the tree    Ah I have ityou
are paroled to silence until the sun has risen above the highest
branch    what    and also must remain here until then     I
seeit was that or die    no     Oh that or be bound
well truly the knaves were wondrous courteous     She studied De
Lacys face a momentthen sat down  Would you like company she
asked
Would he like company  Her company
She laughed gaylythough a bit of color touched her cheek
Thank you she said I can read your countenance better than your
bows
Then suddenly his face grew grave and he motioned no
Yes and I can understand that too she smiled and thank you for
it  It may be a trifle uncommon to sit here in the depths of Windsor
forest with a man I never met    never even saw until last
night    and who has never spoken a single word to me    yet
glancing at the sun the time is not long and    the path is
rarely traveled
He smiledbut the concern lingered in his eyes and he shook his head
questioningly
Nay sir do you not see your very urging me to go proves me safe in
staying
He hesitated still doubtfulthen threw himself on the turf at her
feet
I suppose it is for me to do the talking she observed
And as she talked he fell to watching the sun in her hairthe play of
her lipsthe light in her eyes     Never before would he have
believed that grey could be so deep and tender or that a mouth could
be so tantalizing or the curve of a cheek so sweet or ruddy tresses
so alluring     And her voicewas there ever such anothersoft
low clear like silver bells at twilight out at sea
And in the watching he lost her words nor nodded when he
shoulduntil at length she sprang up and went over to her horse
And when in sharp contrition he followed after to apologize she met
him with a laugh and gracious gesturethen pointed to the sun
The parole is lifted she said  Will you put me up
With his sound arm he swung her into saddleand with Rollo in advance
and him beside her they went slowly back to Windsor  And now he did
the talkingtelling first the story of the outlaws
When the towers of the huge castle showed afar through the trees De
Lacy halted
Would you deem me rude if I went no further with you he asked
She smiled kindly  On the contrary I would deem you very wise
I care not to proclaim my adventure with the outlaws  It would make
me a merry jest in the hall
I understandand yet wounded and without bonnet or doublet you will
not pass unnoted an explanation will be obligatory
The wound is easy he said my own dagger made it you rememberbut
the doublet and bonnet particularly the doublet are bothersome
She looked at him with quick decision
I will manage that she said your squire shall bring both to you
here
De Lacys face lighted with sudden pleasure and he put out his hand
toward hersthen drew it sharply back and bowed
Still bowing she said naively
I have no words to speak my gratitude he said
And I no ears that wish to hear them if you had she laughed  This
morning you have had much troubleI much pleasurethe scales are
balancedthe accounts canceled  We will forget it all  Never will I
mention it to younor you to menor either to another  When we meet
again it will be as though today had never been    Nay sir it
must be so  You have been unfortunate I unconventionalit is best
for both we start afresh
But am I not even to know your name he protested
She shook her head  Not even that now and I ask your word not to
seek to know ituntil we meet again
You have it said he until we meet againtomorrow
She smiled vaguely  It will be a far tomorrow    goodbye my
lord and rode awaythen turned  Wait for your squire she called
And for tomorrow he cried
But she made no answer and with a wave of her hand was gone the dog
leaping in front of her and baying loud with joy
II
RICHARD OF GLOUCESTER
But the morrow brought no maid nor a fortnight of morrowsshe had
vanished and seek as he might at Windsor or through the Tower he could
not find her  Had he been privileged to inquire the quest would have
been ended by a wordbut she herself had closed his lips to questions
Then the mighty Edward died and all was confusion in the Court and
what with the funeral the goings and the comings the plottings and
the intrigues De Lacy was in a maze  The boy King was at Ludlow with
Rivers and it was Nobility against Queen and Woodville until he came
for his crowning  And in the turmoil De Lacy was forced to cease for
the nonce the pursuit of ruddy tresses and grey eyes and choose where
he would stand  And presently that choice sent him riding into the
Northbearing a message to the man in distant Pontefract upon whom
at that moment all England was waiting and who as yet had made no
move Richard of Gloucester
The day was far spent and before a fireplace in his private apartments
Richard sat alone in heavy meditation  The pale cleanshaven
youthful face with its beautiful mouth and straight Norman nose and
the short slender figure in its mantle and doublet of black velvet
furred with ermine rich under tunic of white satin tightfitting hose
of silk and dark brown hair hanging bushy to the shoulders would have
been almost effeminate but for the massively majestic forehead and the
fierce black eyesbrilliant compelling stern proudthat flashed
forth the mighty soul within
Although he had just passed his thirtieth year yet his fame was as
wide as the domain of chivalry and his name a thing to conjure with in
England  Born in an age when almost as children men of rank and
station were called upon to take their sires place Richard had been
famed for his wisdom and statecraft before the years when the period of
youth is now presumed to begin  At the age of eighteen he had led the
flower of the Yorkist army at the great battles of Barnet and
Tewkesbury and not the dauntless Edward himself then in the heyday of
his prowess was more to be feared than the slight boy who swept with
inconceivable fury through the Lancastrian line carrying death on his
lancepoint and making the Boar of Gloucester forever famous in English
heraldry  And since then his hauberk had scarce been off his back and
while his royal brother was dallying in a life of indulgence amid the
dissipations of his Court the brave and resolute Richard was leading
his armies administering his governments and preserving order on the
Marches of the Border
Presently there was a sharp knock on the door and a page entered
Well demanded the Duke abruptly
May it please you my lord said the boy a messenger of importance
who desires immediate audience
Richard frowned slightly
Whose badge does he wear he asked
No ones my lord but the fashion of his armor savors of the Court
He bade me announce him as Sir Aymer de Lacy
The name boy is better recommendation than any fashion  Admit him
De Lacy crossed to the center of the apartment with easy grace and
after a deep obeisance stood erect and silent facing the Duke who eyed
him critically  A trifle over the average height and rather slender
and clad in complete mail except for the bascinet which he carried in
his hand there was something in his appearance and bearing that
impressed even the warlike Richard  His dark hair hung in curls to his
gorget  His hauberk of polished steel was but partially concealed by
the jupon of azure silk emblazoned with a silver stag trippant his
cuissarts and greaves glistened in the firelight and his long
sollerets bore on their heels the golden spurs of his rank  Around his
waist was a broad belt wrought in gold and from it almost in front
hung a great twohanded sword whose point reached to within a few
inches of the floor
You are welcome said Gloucester  A De Lacy should ever find a
ready greeting at Pontefract  Of what branch of the family are you
One far removed from that which built this fortress most noble Duke
returned the Knight with a peculiarly soft accent  My own ancestor
was but distantly connected with the last great Earl of Lincoln whom
the First Edward loved so well
I do not recall your name among those who fought for either York or
Lancaster  Did your family wear the White Rose or the Red
Neither said De Lacy  Providence removed my sire ere the fray
began aright and when I was but a child in arms  When Your Grace won
fame at Tewkesbury I had but turned my thirteenth year
Where is your family seat
At Gaillard Castle in the shire of Leicester close by the River
Weakor at least it stood there when last I saw it  It is ten long
years since I crossed its drawbridge and not twelve months of my life
have been spent within its walls
Your accent smacks of a Southern sun said the Duke
My mother was of a French house and to her own land she took me when
my father died and observing the Duke glance at his spurs he added
It was from Frances Constable that I received the accolade
Then right well did you deserve it St Pol gave no unearned honors
I was favored much beyond my deserts De Lacy replied although his
face flushed at a compliment from the renowned Gloucester
Your modesty but proves your merit returned the Duke    And now
your message  From whom come you
From the Duke of Buckingham my lord said De Lacy and the keen look
that accompanied the words did not escape the Prince  But De Lacy did
not know the man before whom he stood else would he have wasted no
energy in any such attempt  As well try to read the visage of a
granite cliff as to discover the thoughts of Richard Plantagenet from
the expression of his face  And if the royal Duke were in aught
concerned as to the communication of the powerful Buckingham there was
no evidence of it in his voice or in the eminently courteous and
appropriate question as he instantly responded
How did you leave His Grace and where
He was most hearty when we parted at Gloucester he for his castle of
Brecknock and I for Pontefract
He had been in London
Yes my lord since before King Edwards demise
Then are his letters very welcome
Your pardon sir said De Lacy but I bear no letters and as
Richard regarded him in sharp interrogation he added My message is by
word of mouth
And why said the Duke in the same calm tone he had employed
throughout the conversation should I credit your story seeing that I
neither know you nor recall your silver trippant stag among the present
devices of our land
My bearing returned De Lacy tranquilly comes to me from my
mothers family of which she was the heiress and on English
battlefield it has never shone  And unless this ring attest the
authority of my message it must be unsaid and drawing from his finger
a broad gold band in which was set a great flat emerald with a swan
exquisitely cut on its face he handed it to the Duke
Richard examined it for a moment then returned it with a smile
You are sufficiently accredited he said  I will hear your message
What said Stafford
The Duke of Buckingham replied Aymer sends to the Duke of
Gloucester his most humble greeting and his very sincere condolence
upon the death of Your Graces great brother and sire
Pass over the formalities Sir Aymer interrupted the Duke curtly
It was scarce for them you rode from London to Pontefract
Aymer bowed  Buckinghams message was in these words Tell the Duke
of Gloucester to hasten to London without delay  I have conferred with
the Lords Howard Hastings and Stanley and we are of the one mind
that he must be Lord Protector  Tell him we pledge to him our whole
support if he will give us his countenance in this crucial struggle
against the Woodvilles
Did he say nothing as to the present status of the situation
inquired Gloucester quietly  I am far from Court and know little of
its happenings
With them my lord I am fully acquainted said De Lacy both from
my own observation and by the Duke himself
How stands the matter then
Rather favorable to the Queens faction than otherwise  The Kings
coronation has been fixed for the first Lords Day of the coming month
and His Majesty is to be escorted from Ludlow by two thousand men  The
Marquis of Dorset has seized the treasure in the Tower and Sir Edward
Woodville has been tampering with the navy and methinks not without
result  The Queen and the whole family are catering to the populace
and spare no effort to win their favor  Only action sharp and sudden
will enable the Barons to prevail
For a moment Gloucester made no response but sat with his head bent
upon his bosom as was his habit when in thought  Presently he said
How do you know that the Kings escort will number two thousand
The Council so fixed it and very much against the wishes of the
Queen
She wanted more I doubt not said the Duke meditatively
She long held that less than five thousand would not be fitting the
dignity of a King
Gloucester looked up with a trace of a smile around his eyes
Will the Earl of Rivers accompany his nephew he asked
It was so reported to His Grace of Buckingham and further also that
they would not start from Ludlow until the feast of St George had
passed
Did Stafford advise no plan in case I fell in with his desires
None  The lords will follow whatever course you fix  All that they
urge is haste
How long does Buckingham remain at Brecknock
Until he receive word from youor failing in that until there be but
time sufficient to reach London for the coronation
Was it his purpose that you should carry my answer
Nay my lord Duke said De Lacy  Here ends my mission for
Buckingham  It was but as friend for friend that I bore this message
I am not of his household nor was it his business that brought me here
What brought you to Pontefract then Sir Knight said Richard
sternly  As Buckinghams messenger you have received due honor that
aside your name alone commends you
I sought Pontefract De Lacy replied for the single purpose of
tendering my sword to the Duke of Gloucester hoping in his service to
brighten the dimmed lustre of my House
Not for an instant did the searching eyes of Richard leave the young
Knights face
Why do you prefer the Boar of Gloucester to the Stafford Knot
Buckingham is most puissant
A De Lacy my lord answered Aymer proudly follows none but
Plantagenet
Bravely spoken said Gloucester suddenly dropping his stern air
and worthy of the great name you bear  I accept your sword  Nay
kneel not sir Richard Plantagenet deems himself most fortunate to
have you at his side
