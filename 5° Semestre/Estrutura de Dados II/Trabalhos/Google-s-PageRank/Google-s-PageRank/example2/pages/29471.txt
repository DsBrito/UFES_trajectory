stowed away the tools in the pouch and unlocked the door
The unused elevator shaft acted as waste chute he slipped his newspaper
through a slot in the door as he went by Keeping close to the wall he
picked his way carefully down the greasestained stairs He slowed his
pace at the 17th floor as two other mechs turned in ahead of him They
were obviously butchers or meatcutters where the right hand should
have been on each of them there stuck out a wicked footlong knife As
they approached the foot of the stairs they stopped to slip the knives
into the plastic sheaths that were bolted to their chestplates Jon
followed them down the ramp into the lobby
The room was filled to capacity with robots of all sizes forms and
colors Jon Venexs greater height enabled him to see over their heads
to the glass doors that opened onto the street It had rained the night
before and the rising sun drove red glints from the puddles on the
sidewalk Three robots painted snow white to show they were night
workers pushed the doors open and came in No one went out as the
curfew hadnt ended yet They milled around slowly talking in low
voices
The only human being in the entire lobby was the night clerk dozing
behind the counter The clock over his head said five minutes to six
Shifting his glance from the clock Jon became aware of a squat black
robot waving to attract his attention The powerful arms and compact
build identified him as a member of the Diger family one of the most
numerous groups He pushed through the crowd and clapped Jon on the back
with a resounding clang
Jon Venex I knew it was you as soon as I saw you sticking up out of
this crowd like a green tree trunk I havent seen you since the old
days on Venus
Jon didnt need to check the number stamped on the short ones scratched
chestplate Alec Diger had been his only close friend during those
thirteen boring years at Orange Sea Camp A good chess player and a whiz
at Twohanded Handball they had spent all their off time together They
shook hands with the extra squeeze that means friendliness
Alec you beatup little grease pot what brings you to New York
The burning desire to see something besides rain and jungle if you
must know After you bought out things got just too damn dull I began
working two shifts a day in that foul diamond mine and then three a day
for the last month to get enough credits to buy my contract and passage
back to earth I was underground so long that the photocell on my right
eye burned out when the sunlight hit it
He leaned forward with a hoarse confidential whisper If you want to
know the truth I had a sixtycarat diamond stuck behind the eye lens I
sold it here on earth for two hundred credits gave me six months of
easy living Its all gone now so Im on my way to the employment
exchange His voice boomed loud again And how about you
Jon Venex chuckled at his friends frank approach to life Its just
been the old routine with me a run of odd jobs until I got sideswiped
by a busit fractured my knee bearing The only job I could get with a
bad leg was feeding slops to pigs Earned enough to fix the kneeand
here I am
Alec jerked his thumb at a rustcolored threefoottall robot that had
come up quietly beside him If you think youve got trouble take a look
at Dik here thats no coat of paint on him Dik Dryer meet Jon Venex
an old buddy of mine
Jon bent over to shake the little mechs hand His eye shutters dilated
as he realized what he had thought was a coat of paint was a thin layer
of rust that coated Diks metal body Alec scratched a shiny path in
the rust with his fingertip His voice was suddenly serious
Dik was designed for operation in the Martian desert Its as dry as a
fossil bone there so his skinflint company cut corners on the stainless
steel
When they went bankrupt he was sold to a firm here in the city After a
while the rust started to eat in and slow him down they gave Dik his
contract and threw him out
The small robot spoke for the first time his voice grated and
scratched Nobody will hire me like this but I cant get repaired
until I get a job His arms squeaked and grated as he moved them Im
going by the Robot Free Clinic again today they said they might be able
to do something
Alec Diger rumbled in his deep chest Dont put too much faith in those
people Theyre great at giving out tenthcredit oil capsules or a
little free wirebut dont depend on them for anything important
It was six now the robots were pushing through the doors into the
silent streets They joined the crowd moving out Jon slowing his stride
so his shorter friends could keep pace Dik Dryer moved with a jerking
irregular motion his voice as uneven as the motion of his body
JonVenex I dont recognize your family name Something to dowith
Venusperhaps
Venus is right Venus Experimentalthere are only twentytwo of us in
the family We have waterproof pressureresistant bodies for working
down on the ocean bottom The basic idea was all right we did our part
only there wasnt enough money in the channeldredging contract to keep
us all working I bought out my original contract at half price and
became a free robot
Dik vibrated his rusted diaphragm Being free isnt all it should be I
sometimes wish the Robot Equality Act hadnt been passed I would just
llove to be owned by a nice rich company with a machine shop and
amountain of replacement parts
You dont really mean that Dik Alec Diger clamped a heavy black arm
across his shoulders Things arent perfect now we know that but its
certainly a lot better than the old days we were just hunks of
machinery then Used twentyfour hours a day until we were worn out and
then thrown in the junk pile No thanks Ill take my chances with
things as they are
Jon and Alec turned into the employment exchange saying goodby to Dik
who went on slowly down the street They pushed up the crowded ramp and
joined the line in front of the registration desk The bulletin board
next to the desk held a scattering of white slips announcing job
openings A clerk was pinning up new additions
Venex scanned them with his eyes stopping at one circled in red

Jon rapped excitedly on Alec Digers neck Look there a job in my own
specialtyI can get my old pay rate See you back at the hotel
tonightand good luck in your job hunting
Alec waved goodby Lets hope the jobs as good as you think I never
trust those things until I have my credits in my hand
Jon walked quickly from the employment exchange his long legs eating up
the blocks Good old Alec he didnt believe in anything he couldnt
touch Perhaps he was right but why try to be unhappy The world wasnt
too bad this morninghis leg worked fine prospects of a good jobhe
hadnt felt this cheerful since the day he was activated
Turning the corner at a brisk pace he collided with a man coming from
the opposite direction Jon had stopped on the instant but there wasnt
time to jump aside The obese individual jarred against him and fell to
the ground From the height of elation to the depths of despair in an
instanthe had injured a human being
He bent to help the man to his feet but the other would have none of
that He evaded the friendly hand and screeched in a highpitched voice
Officer officer police  HELP Ive been attackeda mad robot
HELP
A crowd was gatheringstaying at a respectful distancebut making an
angry muttering noise Jon stood motionless his head reeling at the
enormity of what he had done A policeman pushed his way through the
crowd
Seize him officer shoot him down  he struck me  almost killed
me  The man shook with rage his words thickening to a senseless
babble
The policeman had his 75 recoilless revolver out and pressed against
Jons side
This man has charged you with a serious crime greasecan Im
taking you into the station houseto talk about it He looked around
nervously waving his gun to open a path through the tightly packed
crowd They moved back grudgingly with murmurs of disapproval
Jons thoughts swirled in tight circles How did a catastrophe like this
happen where was it going to end He didnt dare tell the truth that
would mean he was calling the man a liar There had been six robots
powerlined in the city since the first of the year If he dared speak
in his own defense there would be a jumper to the street lighting
circuit and a seventh burnt out hulk in the police morgue
A feeling of resignation swept through him there was no way out If the
man pressed charges it would mean a term of penal servitude though it
looked now as if he would never live to reach the court The papers had
been whipping up a lot of antirobe feeling you could feel it behind
the angry voices see it in the narrowed eyes and clenched fists The
crowd was slowly changing into a mob a mindless mob as yet but capable
of turning on him at any moment
Whats goin on here It was a booming voice with a quality that
dragged at the attention of the crowd
A giant crosscontinent freighter was parked at the curb The driver
swung down from the cab and pushed his way through the people The
policeman shifted his gun as the man strode up to him
Thats my robot you got there Jack dont put any holes in him He
turned on the man who had been shouting accusations Fatty here is the
worlds biggest liar The robot was standing here waiting for me to park
the truck Fatty must be as blind as he is stupid I saw the whole
thing He knocks himself down walking into the robe then starts
hollering for the cops
The other man could take no more His face crimson with anger he rushed
toward the trucker his fists swinging in ungainly circles They never
landed the truck driver put a meaty hand on the others face and seated
him on the sidewalk for the second time
The onlookers roared with laughter the powerlining and the robot were
forgotten The fight was between two men now the original cause had
slipped from their minds Even the policeman allowed himself a small
smile as he holstered his gun and stepped forward to separate the men
The trucker turned towards Jon with a scowl
Come on you aboard the truckyouve caused me enough trouble for one
day What a junkcan
The crowd chuckled as he pushed Jon ahead of him into the truck and
slammed the door behind them Jamming the starter with his thumb he
gunned the thunderous diesels into life and pulled out into the traffic
Jon moved his jaw but there were no words to come out Why had this
total stranger helped him what could he say to show his appreciation
He knew that all humans werent robehaters why it was even rumored
that some humans treated robots as equals instead of machines The
driver must be one of these mythical individuals there was no other way
to explain his actions
Driving carefully with one hand the man reached up behind the dash and
drew out a thin plastikoid booklet He handed it to Jon who quickly
scanned the title Robot Slaves in a World Economy by Philpott Asimov
II
If youre caught reading that thing theyll execute you on the spot
Better stick it between the insulation on your generator you can always
burn it if youre picked up
Read it when youre alone its got a lot of things in it that you know
nothing about Robots arent really inferior to humans in fact theyre
superior in most things There is even a little history in there to show
that robots arent the first ones to be treated as second class
citizens You may find it a little hard to believe but human beings
once treated each other just the way they treat robots now Thats one
of the reasons Im active in this movementsort of like the fellow who
was burned helping others stay away from the fire
He smiled a warm friendly smile in Jons direction the whiteness of
his teeth standing out against the rich ebony brown of his features
Im heading towards US1 can I drop you anywheres on the way
The Chainjet Building pleaseIm applying for a job
They rode the rest of the way in silence Before he opened the door the
driver shook hands with Jon
Sorry about calling you junkcan but the crowd expected it He
didnt look back as he drove away
Jon had to wait a half hour for his turn but the receptionist finally
signalled him towards the door of the interviewers room He stepped in
quickly and turned to face the man seated at the transplastic desk an
upset little man with permanent worry wrinkles stamped in his forehead
The little man shoved the papers on the desk around angrily
occasionally making crabbed little notes on the margins He flashed a
birdlike glance up at Jon
Yes yes be quick What is it you want
You posted a help wanted notice I
The man cut him off with a wave of his hand All right let me see your
ID tag  quickly there are others waiting
Jon thumbed the tag out of his waist slot and handed it across the desk
The interviewer read the code number then began running his finger down
a long list of similar figures He stopped suddenly and looked sideways
at Jon from under his lowered lids
You have made a mistake we have no opening for you
Jon began to explain to the man that the notice had requested his
specialty but he was waved to silence As the interviewer handed back
the tag he slipped a card out from under the desk blotter and held it in
front of Jons eyes He held it there for only an instant knowing that
the written message was recorded instantly by the robots photographic
vision and eidetic memory The card dropped into the ash tray and flared
into embers at the touch of the mans pencilheater
Jon stuffed the ID tag back into the slot and read over the message on
the card as he walked down the stairs to the street There were six
lines of typewritten copy with no signature
To Venex Robot You are urgently needed on a top secret company
project There are suspected informers in the main office so you
are being hired in this unusual manner Go at once to 787 Washington
Street and ask for Mr Coleman
Jon felt an immense sensation of relief For a moment there he was sure
the job had been a false lead He saw nothing unusual in the method of
hiring The big corporations were immensely jealous of their research
discoveries and went to great lengths to keep them secretat the same
time resorting to any means to ferret out their business rivals
secrets There might still be a chance to get this job
The burly bulk of a lifter was moving back and forth in the gloom of the
ancient warehouse stacking crates in ceilinghigh rows Jon called to
him the robot swung up his forklift and rolled over on noiseless tires
When Jon questioned him he indicated a stairwell against the rear wall
Mr Colemans office is down in back the door is marked The lifter
put his fingertips against Jons ear pickups and lowered his voice to
the merest shadow of a whisper It would have been inaudible to human
ears but Jon could hear him easily the sounds being carried through
the metal of the others body
Hes the meanest man you ever methe hates robots so be ever so
polite If you can use sir five times in one sentence youre perfectly
safe
Jon swept the shutter over one eye tube in a conspiratorial wink the
large mech did the same as he rolled away Jon turned and went down the
dusty stairwell and knocked gently on Mr Colemans door
Coleman was a plump little individual in a conservative
purpleandyellow business suit He kept glancing from Jon to the Robot
General Catalog checking the Venex specifications listed there
Seemingly satisfied he slammed the book shut
Gimme your tag and back against that wall to get measured
Jon laid his ID tag on the desk and stepped towards the wall Yes sir
here it is sir Two sir on that one not bad for the first sentence
He wondered idly if he could put five of them in one sentence without
the man knowing he was being made a fool of
He became aware of the danger an instant too late The current surged
through the powerful electromagnet behind the plaster flattening his
metal body helplessly against the wall Coleman was almost dancing with
glee
We got him Druce hes mashed flatter than a stinking tincan on a
rock cant move a motor Bring that junk in here and lets get him
ready
Druce had a mechanics coveralls on over his street suit and a tool box
slung under one arm He carried a little black metal can at arms
length trying to get as far from it as possible Coleman shouted at him
with annoyance
That bomb cant go off until its armed stop acting like a child Put
it on that greasecans leg and quick
Grumbling under his breath Druce spotwelded the metal flanges of the
bomb onto Jons leg a few inches above his knee Coleman tugged at it to
be certain it was secure then twisted a knob in the side and pulled out
a glistening length of pin There was a cold little click from inside
the mechanism as it armed itself
Jon could do nothing except watch even his vocal diaphragm was locked
by the magnetic field He had more than a suspicion however that he was
involved in something other than a secret business deal He cursed his
own stupidity for walking blindly into the situation
The magnetic field cut off and he instantly raced his extensor motors to
leap forward Coleman took a plastic box out of his pocket and held his
thumb over a switch inset into its top
Dont make any quick moves junkyard this little transmitter is keyed
to a receiver in that bomb on your leg One touch of my thumb up you go
in a cloud of smoke and come down in a shower of nuts and bolts He
signalled to Druce who opened a closet door And in case you want to be
heroic just think of him
Coleman jerked his thumb at the sodden shape on the floor a filthily
attired man of indistinguishable age whose only interesting feature was
the black bomb strapped tightly across his chest He peered unseeingly
from redrimmed eyes and raised the almost empty whiskey bottle to his
mouth Coleman kicked the door shut
Hes just some Bowery bum we dragged in Venex but that doesnt make
any difference to you does it Hes humanand a robot cant kill
anybody That rummy has a bomb on him tuned to the same frequency as
yours if you dont play ball with us he gets a twofoot hole blown in
his chest
Coleman was right Jon didnt dare make any false moves All of his
early mental training as well as Circuit 92 sealed inside his brain case
would prevent him from harming a human being He felt trapped caught by
these people for some unknown purpose
Coleman had pushed back a tarpaulin to disclose a ragged hole in the
concrete floor the opening extended into the earth below He waved Jon
over
The tunnel is in good shape for about thirty feet then youll find a
fall Clean all the rock and dirt out until you break through into the
storm sewer then come back And you better be alone If you tip the
cops both you and the old stew go out togethernow move
The shaft had been dug recently and shored with packing crates from the
warehouse overhead It ended abruptly in a wall of fresh sand and stone
Jon began shoveling it into the little wheelbarrow they had given him
He had emptied four barrow loads and was filling the fifth when he
uncovered the hand a robots hand made of green metal He turned his
headlight power up and examined the hand closely there could be no
doubt about it These gaskets on the joints the rivet pattern at the
base of the thumb meant only one thing it was the dismembered hand of a
Venex robot
Quickly yet gently he shoveled away the rubble behind the hand and
unearthed the rest of the robot The torso was crushed and the power
circuits shorted battery acid was dripping from an ugly rent in the
side With infinite care Jon snapped the few remaining wires that joined
the neck to the body and laid the green head on the barrow It stared at
him like a skull the shutters completely dilated but no glow of life
from the tubes behind them
He was scraping the mud from the number on the battered chestplate when
Druce lowered himself into the tunnel and flashed the brilliant beam of
a handspot down its length
Stop playing with that junk and get diggingor youll end up the same
as him This tunnel has gotta be through by tonight
Jon put the dismembered parts on the barrow with the sand and rock and
pushed the whole load back up the tunnel his thoughts running in
unhappy circles A dead robot was a terrible thing and one of his
family too But there was something wrong about this robot something
that was quite inexplicable the number on the plate had been 17 yet
he remembered only too well the day that a watershorted motor had
killed Venex 17 in the Orange Sea
It took Jon four hours to drive the tunnel as far as the ancient granite
wall of the storm sewer Druce gave him a short pinch bar and he levered
out enough of the big blocks to make a hole large enough to let him
through into the sewer
When he climbed back into the office he tried to look casual as he
dropped the pinch bar to the floor by his feet and seated himself on the
pile of rubble in the corner He moved around to make a comfortable seat
for himself and his fingers grabbed the severed neck of Venex 17
Coleman swiveled around in his chair and squinted at the wall clock He
checked the time against his tiepin watch with a grunt of satisfaction
he turned back and stabbed a finger at Jon
Listen you green junkpile at 1900 hours youre going to do a job
and there arent going to be any slip ups You go down that sewer and
into the Hudson River The outlet is under water so you wont be seen
from the docks Climb down to the bottom and walk 200 yards north that
should put you just under a ship Keep your eyes open but dont show
any lights About halfway down the keel of the ship youll find a chain
hanging
Climb the chain pull loose the box thats fastened to the hull at the
top and bring it back here No mistakesor you know what happens
Jon nodded his head His busy fingers had been separating the wires in
the amputated neck When they had been straightened and put into a row
he memorized their order with one flashing glance
He ran over the color code in his mind and compared it with the
memorized leads The twelfth wire was the main cranial power lead
number six was the return wire
With his precise touch he separated these two from the pack and glanced
idly around the room Druce was dozing on a chair in the opposite
corner Coleman was talking on the phone his voice occasionally rising
in a petulant whine This wasnt interfering with his attention to
Jonand the radio switch still held tightly in left hand
Jons body blocked Colemans vision as long as Druce stayed asleep he
would be able to work on the head unobserved He activated a relay in
his forearm and there was a click as the waterproof cover on an exterior
socket swung open This was a power outlet from his battery that was
used to operate motorized tools and lights underwater
If Venex 17s head had been severed for less than three weeks he could
reactivate it Every robot had a small storage battery inside his skull
if the power to the brain was cut off the battery would provide the
minimum standby current to keep the brain alive The robe would be
unconscious until full power was restored
Jon plugged the wires into his armoutlet and slowly raised the current
to operating level There was a tense moment of waiting then 17s eye
shutters suddenly closed When they opened again the eye tubes were
glowing warmly They swept the room with one glance then focused on Jon
The right shutter clicked shut while the other began opening and closing
in rapid fashion It was International codebeing sent as fast as the
solenoid could be operated Jon concentrated on the message
Telephonecall emergency operatortell her signal 14 help will
The shutter stopped in the middle of a code group the light of reason
dying from the eyes
For one instant Jons heart leaped in panic until he realized that 17
had deliberately cut the power Druces harsh voice rasped in his ear
What you doing with that None of your funny robot tricks I know your
kind plotting all kinds of things in them tin domes His voice trailed
off into a stream of incomprehensible profanity With sudden spite he
lashed his foot out and sent 17s head crashing against the wall
The dented green head rolled to a stop at Jons feet the face staring
up at him in mute agony It was only Circuit 92 that prevented him from
injuring a human As his motors revved up to send him hurtling forward
the control relays clicked open He sank against the debris paralyzed
for the instant As soon as the rush of anger was gone he would regain
control of his body
They stood as if frozen in a tableau The robot slumped backward the
man leaning forward his face twisted with unreasoning hatred The head
lay between them like a symbol of death
Colemans voice cut through the air of tenseness like a knife
Druce stop playing with the greasecan and get down to the main door
to let Little Willy and his junkbrokers in You can have it all to
yourself afterward
The angry man turned reluctantly but pushed out of the door at
Colemans annoyed growl Jon sat down against the wall his mind sorting
out the few facts with lightning precision There was no room in his
thoughts for Druce the man had become just one more factor in a complex
problem
Call the emergency operatorthat meant this was no local matter
responsible authorities must be involved Only the government could be
behind a thing as major as this Signal 14that inferred a complex set
of arrangements forces that could swing into action at a moments
notice There was no indication where this might lead but the only
thing to do was to get out of here and make that phone call And quick
Druce was bringing in more people junkbrokers whatever they were Any
action that he took would have to be done before they returned
Even as Jon followed this train of logic his fingers were busy Palming
a wrench he was swiftly loosening the main retaining nut on his hip
joint It dropped free in his hand only the pivot pin remained now to
hold his leg on He climbed slowly to his feet and moved towards
Colemans desk
Mr Coleman sir its time to go down to the ship now should I leave
now sir
Jon spoke the words slowly as he walked forward apparently going to the
door but angling at the same time towards the plump mans desk
You got thirty minutes yet go sitsay
The words were cut off Fast as a human reflex is it is the barest
crawl compared to the lightning action of electronic reflex At the
instant Coleman was first aware of Jons motion the robot had finished
his leap and lay sprawled across the desk his leg off at the hip and
clutched in his hand
YOULL KILL YOURSELF IF YOU TOUCH THE BUTTON
The words were part of the calculated plan Jon bellowed them in the
startled mans ear as he stuffed the dismembered leg down the front of
the mans baggy slacks It had the desired effect Colemans finger
stabbed at the button but stopped before it made contact He stared down
with bulging eyes at the little black box of death peeping out of his
waistband
Jon hadnt waited for the reaction He pushed backward from the desk and
stopped to grab the stolen pinch bar off the floor A mighty onelegged
leap brought him to the locked closet he stabbed the bar into the space
between the door and frame and heaved
Coleman was just starting to struggle the bomb out of his pants when the
action was over The closet open Jon seized the heavy strap holding the
second bomb on the rummys chest and snapped it like a thread He threw
the bomb into Colemans corner giving the man one more thing to worry
about It had cost him a leg but Jon had escaped the bomb threat
without injuring a human Now he had to get to a phone and make that
call
Coleman stopped tugging at the bomb and plunged his hand into the desk
drawer for a gun The returning men would block the door soon the only
other exit from the room was a frostedglass window that opened onto the
mammoth bay of the warehouse
Jon Venex plunged through the window in a welter of flying glass The
heavy thud of a recoilless 75 came from the room behind him and a
footlong section of metal window frame leaped outward Another slug
screamed by the robots head as he scrambled toward the rear door of the
warehouse
He was a bare thirty feet away from the back entrance when the giant
door hissed shut on silent rollers All the doors would have closed at
the same time the thud of running feet indicated that they would be
guarded as well Jon hopped a section of packing cases and crouched out
of sight
He looked up over his head there stretched a webbing of steel supports
crossing and recrossing until they joined the flat expanse of the roof
To human eyes the shadows there deepened into obscurity but the
infrared from a network of steam pipes gave Jon all the illumination he
needed
The men would be quartering the floor of the warehouse soon his only
chance to escape recapture or death would be over their heads Besides
this he was hampered by the loss of his leg In the rafters he could
use his arms for faster and easier travel
Jon was just pulling himself up to one of the topmost cross beams when
a hoarse shout from below was followed by a stream of bullets They tore
through the thin roof one slug clanged off the steel beam under his
body Waiting until three of the newcomers had started up a nearby
ladder Jon began to quietly work his way towards the back of the
building
Safe for the moment he took stock of his position The men were spread
out through the building it could only be a matter of time before they
found him The doors were all locked andhe had made a complete circuit
of the building to be surethere were no windows that he could
forcethe windows were bolted as well If he could call the emergency
operator the unknown friends of Venex 17 might come to his aid This
however was out of the question The only phone in the building was on
Colemans desk He had traced the leads to make sure
His eyes went automatically to the cables above his head Plastic
gaskets were set in the wall of the building through them came the
