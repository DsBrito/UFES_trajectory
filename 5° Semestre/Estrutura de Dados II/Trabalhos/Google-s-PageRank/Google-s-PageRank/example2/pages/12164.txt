PART IFIVE MILES OUT
CHAPTER I
FIVE MILES OUT
The four LanesMax Sally Alec and Robertclimbed the five flights of
stairs to their small flat with the agility of youth and the impetus of
high but subdued excitement Uncle Timothy Rudd following more slowly
reached the outer door of the little suite of rooms in time to hear what
seemed to be the first outburst
Well what do you think now
Fortytwo acres and the house Open the windows and give us air
Acres run to seed and the house tumbling down about its own ears A
magnificent inheritance that Max cast his hat upon a chair as if he
flung it away with the inheritance
But who ever thought Uncle Maxwell Lane would ever leave his poor
relations anything This was Sally
Five miles out by roada bit less by trolley Lets go and see it
tomorrow afternoon Thank goodness a half holiday is so near
Anybody been by the place lately
I was just the other day on my wheel I didnt think it looked so
awfully bad This was Robert the sixteenyearold
As Uncle Timothy entered the tiny sittingroom Sally was speaking She
had thrown her black veil back over her hat revealing masses of flaxen
hair and deep blue eyes glowing with interest Her delicate cheeks were
warmly flushed partly with excitement and partly because for two hours
nowduring the journey from the flat to the lawyers office the period
spent therein listening to the reading of Uncle Maxwell Lanes will and
the business appertaining thereto and the return trip homeshe had
worn the veil closely drawn Her simple mourning was to her a screen
behind which to shield herself from curious eyes always attracted by
those masses of singularly fair hair and the unusual contours of the
young face beneath
I think its a godsend if ever anything was she was saying Heres
Max killing himself in the bank and Alec growing pale and grouchy in
the office and even Bob She was interrupted by a chorus of protests
against her terms of description
Im not killing myself
Pale and grouchy Im not a patch on
Whats the matter with Bob Sally Lunn
And Uncle Timmy continued Sally undisturbed by interpolations to
which she was quite accustomed pining for fresh air
I walk in the park every day my dear Uncle Timothy felt obliged to
remind her
Yes I know But youve lived in a little city flat just as long as its
good for you and you need to be turned outdoors So do we all Oh boys
and Uncle TimmyI just sat there crying and smiling under my veil in
that dreadful officecrying to think that I couldnt cry for Uncle
Maxwell because he was so cold and queer to us always and yet he had
given us this property after all
And a mighty small fraction of the estate it is I hope you understand
growled Max
But Sally went on without minding Everybody was used to Maxs growls
And smiling because I couldnt help it just to think we had a chance at
last to get out of the city We can do it Five miles by trolley is
nothing for you boys or for me when I need to come in
Youre not talking about our going to live out there Maxs tone
was derisive
Why not
Have you seen the place lately
Not since I was a little girl but I remember I thought it was
lovely then
It isnt lovely now if it ever waswhich I doubt In the first place
it belongs to that little suburb of Wyburyas commonplace a village as
ever existed within five miles of as big a city as this In the second
place its as much an abandoned farm as neglect can make a place that was
once I suppose an aristocratic sort of country home The old mansion is
as big as a barn and as hopeless You couldnt any more make a home out
of itWhy you could put this whole apartment into the room at the left
of the hall
How do you know so much about it demanded Sally None of us has been
there since Aunt Alicia diedthat was when we were children and Uncle
Maxwell used to spend his summers there
He hasnt spent them there since she died Max asserted How do I know
so much about it I was down there last summer with Frank Sustis His
father sent him out to look the place over with a view to buying it
himself for a summer home You should have heard Prank jeer at the idea
while we were going about
It makes no difference persisted Sally removing her hat and
folding the veil with care I want to see it Well go out
tomorrow wont we
She appealed to her second brother Alec a young fellow of twenty who
had thrown himself listlessly into a chair but who was listening
attentively to the discussion He nodded Of course You couldnt keep
one of us away even Max He wouldnt be done out of the pleasure of
showing us over the place and pointing out the defects if by keeping
still he could own the whole ranch himself
Itll be jolly fun to go cried Bob quickly He could not bear sounds
of disagreement between the members of his family because he knew Sally
did not like it
What do you think about the old place Uncle Timmy questioned Sally
presently She had taken off her one carefullyused street suit and had
put on a fresh little blackandwhite print in which she was setting the
table for dinner All the others except Uncle Timothy had gone out on
various errands
Well Sally said Mr Timothy Rudd thoughtfully I dont know that
Im a competent judge Your Uncle Maxwells place was considered a fine
one in its day Before he made so much money and took to living in town
he used to like it there I think though he didnt say much about it
Im sorry its been allowed to run down There was a pine grove on it
and a splendid young apple orchard and a timber tract at the back that
ought to be worth considerable money by this time if it hasnt been cut
Probably it has with timber bringing the prices it does now
About the house inquired Sally after Uncle Timothy had gone into
more or less detail concerning the place itself Im especially
interested in the house Do you think it would be out of the question
for us to live there
I dont know It would be something of a change from this he admitted
looking about the little diningroom Youve managed to make us all
pretty comfortable here with what there was left of the furniture after
the sale I dont know how far it would go in Maxwells big house Its
pretty large thats a fact According to Max its in need of a good
deal of repair Of course as far as Im concerned I should like to live
out in the country among the green things as I used to do up in New
Hampshire It would be good for us all But you can tell better after
youve seen the place again
There was no denying this Sallys head was so full of plans it was
difficult to wait until the afternoon of the next day when everybody
should be at liberty to make the trip to Wybury The moment luncheon was
over they started and by two oclock the trolleycar whizzing out
through the suburbs to the open country then following the curve along
the river edge to pass through the small settlement called Wybury had
deposited them in the centre of that village
The Maxwell place lay a quarter of a mile down the river road and the
party set off promptly to cover the short distance It was early April
sunny and mild but still rather damp under foot After leaving the board
sidewalks of Wybury there was no accommodation for foot passengers except
the path at the side of the road
Imagine tramping through this mud every night and morning was Maxs
first contribution to the effort he meant to make to disillusionize his
romantic sister whose dreams of life in the country he considered worse
than folly He turned up his trousers widely at the bottom as he spoke
Its such a little way we could soon have a better path Sally
replied Look there are the chimneys Im sure just beyond that grove
of pines Its hardly more than five minutes walk from the car
Five minutes through a February blizzard is five minutes too much
But five minutes through a midsummer evening is an hour too little
Sally gave him back
That pine grove belongs to the place called back Bob who was
considerably in advance of the others Sally in spite of her eagerness
was adapting her pace to the limitations of Uncle Timothy who at sixty
could hardly be expected to walk in competition with nineteen
Pine groves are worth something these days said Max eyeing the thick
tops critically
Sally had charmed eyes for the pine grove but she did not look at it
long for beyond showed the great chimneytops she remembered from her
childhood when it had been the happiest treat she knew to be invited by
Aunt Alicia to spend the day at Uncle Maxwells country place
The young Lanes had all been born and brought up in the city Their home
had been one of moderate luxury until three years before their father
had died suddenly leaving the mere remnant of an estate which had been
supposed to be a large one The shock and the change from a life of ease
to one of close economy had weakened the always delicate constitution of
the wife and mother until a year after her husbands death she had
followed him
Max had left college at the end of his third year and gone into the bank
of which his Uncle Maxwell was vicepresident Alec just ready for
college had reluctantly resigned his purpose and taken a position in the
draftingoffice of a firm of contractors friends of his father Even
Robert the youngest had found something to do The family had sold the
old home to obtain money with which to meet expenses until the salaries
of the workers should begin to count and had moved into the little flat
where the nineteenyearold sister had for a year now done her girlish
best to make a home for her four men as she called them while she
kept many violent attacks of heartache bravely hiddenfor the most
partunder a bright exterior Nobody knew how Sally disliked the
flatunless it was Bob who was her closest confidant
Theres your fine family mansion called Max pointing from the curve
of the road which he had reached close after Bob
Sally stood still in astonished surprise Could that really be the
aristocratic old place of her memory Max could hardly be blamed for his
derisive comments
A noble house gone to decay is a sight infinitely more depressing than
that of an humble one This once had been an imposing structure it
looked now like a relic of war times
Look at the tumbling chimneys crowed Alec Look at the broken
shutters swinging by one hinge See those porch pillarswere they ever
white Behold that side entrancelooks as if a cyclone had struck it
Sally was silent Even her buoyant hopes fell before the indisputable
evidence given by her eyes It was so bigthe old place A small house
one might hope to repair but a large building like thisit would cost
more than they would have to spare in years If the outside were any
indication of the inside the situation was hopeless
She followed Alec in through the gateway at the dilapidated stone
sideposts of which Max gave a significant wave of the hand as he passed
An overgrown hedge ran along the entire front of the place its untrimmed
wildness adding to the general unkempt look as did the sodden tangled
surface of what had once been a lawn the rank bunches of shrubbery which
half hid the front windows from sight and the broken bricks in the old
walk which led beside a grassgrown driveway from gatepost to porch
How did Maxwell ever come to let this place go to seed like this
lamented Uncle Timothy He must have cared nothing at all for it One
would think it was forty years instead of only ten that it had been left
to wind and weather
Its a wonder that some passing tramp hasnt set fire to it commented
Max searching in his pocket for the key which had been delivered to him
by Mr Sidway his uncles executor Take a long breath before I let you
in Itll be musty and fusty enough to stifle you probably
With considerable difficulty he turned the key in the rusty lock and
opened the door which turned creakingly upon its long unused hinges But
with the first step inside Sallys drooping spirits leaped up again
Oh Max she cried what a beautiful old hall
Beautiful is it inquired Max laughing contemptuously Well I cant
say I see it
Looks just like a barracks to me sniffed Alec Phewwwhat airor
lack of it
But it is beautiful persisted Sally in genuine enthusiasm See how
wide and high sweeping straight through to that door at the back And
see the wide low staircase with the spindle railing and the curved posts
at the bottom See the carving over the doorsand the fanlight over the
outside ones And look at that fireplace
She dragged Max by one arm and Uncle Timothy by the other to stand in
front of it Halfway down the hall sharing one of the great chimneys
with another fireplace on the other side of the wall was a chimneypiece
of fine old colonial design The proportions were colossal
It would take a cord of wood to keep the thing going an evening
asserted Max
And then nobodyd be warm unless he was sitting with his head inside the
hood supplemented Alec
But Sally was already off upon explorations She rushed into the room
upon the left of the hall it was a drawingroom thirty feet long by
twenty wide She darted into the room on the rightit was twenty feet
square and back of it lay another of similar size She could no longer
wait for her party with their slow and indifferent following of her
but ran from room to room calling back injunctions to note special
points of interest
Bob kept close behind her If he cared little for old houses he cared
much for Sally and he liked to see her eyes sparkle and her lips laugh
Sally had times of being very sad and discouraged as no one knew so well
as he and if she could find interest in this old barrackshe thought
Alec had struck the right wordhe was not the boy to dampen it
Lets skip up this back staircase Bobby proposed Sally as they
turned about from exploring the kitchen and storerooms Im crazy to
find if there arent some smaller roomsnice cozy ones you know It
cant be all so big everywhere
Dont you suppose the upstairs rooms are just the shape of the lower
ones suggested Bob as they ran up
In front perhaps but not back here There ought to be some lovely
rambling passageways and steps up and steps down and rooms where you
dont expect them and a splendid atticand perhaps a secret staircase
Bobwhat if there should actually be a secret staircase
Bob laughed Youve been reading spooky stories I suppose
Robert Rudd Lane Will you behold that little flight of five steps
leading up to that door
Sally was down the hall and up the five steps in a flash She would have
burst into the unknown region beyond but a locked door barred her way
Bob stood below and laughed at her baffled expression Youd rather see
through that door than into any other spot in the house that isnt locked
up wouldnt you Sally Lunn he commented knowingly
Run down to Max for the keys will you dear she begged and Bob ran
The others came up Max and Bob Alec and even Uncle Timothy tried
every key in the bunch in vain Sally attempted to peer through the
keyhole Bob ran outside and returning reported that there were no
shutters in the region opposite the probable position of the door
Its undoubtedly a dark storeroom with a row of empty shelves said
Max Give it up Sally There are places enough to explore A regiment
of infantry could be bivouacked in this second story See the rooms and
rooms inside of rooms
Oh come away home cried Alec impatiently before Sally was half
satisfied
Im going over to the timber tract Youd better come along Al Let
Sally stay here and plan her hotel Maxwell Inneh Sally A number on
each door and a fireescape at each end of the hall A bellboy and two
chambermaids for this floor in time an elevator and a manicure shop
And Max clattered laughing away down the front staircase the shallow
steps of which he took two at a time
It isnt a very cozy nest is it Sis said Bob sympathetically as
Sally after one look into the great square rooms over the front closed
the doors with a bang
At mention of the timber tract Uncle Timothy had gone downstairs after
the others They heard him shut the front door and from an upper window
saw him walking briskly away
No it isntnow she admitted soberly butwhat a home it
could be made
Its pretty near twice as big as our old one and that was a fairly good
size We could camp out in a corner of it but that would be lonesome
dont you think so We might keep summer boarders
Sally shook her head She began to walk back through the upper halls Bob
followed her and they climbed the attic stairs finding a great space
above lighted by low windows shut in by patterns of ironwork
Jolly what a place for rainy days ejaculated the boy moved to
greater enthusiasm than he had felt anywhere below stairs You could
have a workshop and a gymnasium and all sorts of things You could make
it really festive with a few rugs and pillows and hammocks and things
How the fellows I know would like to get up here
He lingered behind his sister who after one comprehensive look round
the big bare dusty place had slipped away downstairs again guarding
her skirts carefully When Bob after planning in detail a possible
and desirable arrangement of the attic reluctantly descended he found
her at the top of the little flight of steps which led to the one
locked door
Look out The family skeleton may be hidden behind that door he
called racing down the hall Or worse Come away Fatima
Bob said Sally regarding him from the top of the steps her cheeks
brightly flushed her eyes alight with interest I simply have to know
whats beyond this door
What are you expecting to find there Sis Trunks full of gold
Family papers leaving all the Maxwell Lane estate to the Lanes of
Henley Street
She shook her head with a laughing challenge Wait till I get a
locksmith here she said
Ill wait and Bob sat composedly down on the bottom step grinning up
at his excited sister Going to get him out by wireless
CHAPTER II
EVERYBODY EXPLORES
Alighting from her mothers carriage in front of the Winona apartments in
Henley Street Josephine Burnside dismissed her coachman and hurried
eagerly into the florid vestibule
I dont see how Sally endures this sort of thing she thought for the
hundredth time since the Lane house near her own in Grosvenor Place had
been sold The doorlatch clicked promptly in answer to her ring and at
the top of the third flight she met Sally
I was sure it was you Im so glad Im all alone was Sallys joyful
welcome and the next minute Josephine found herself inside the small
passage her outer garments being forcibly removed and herself borne
into the little livingroom and established in Uncle Timothys reading
chair which was the most comfortable one in the place
Sewingas usual What are you making now Something lovely out of
nothing at all I suppose
Of course Its a convenient accomplishment You didnt know that four
and a half yards of Swiss muslin would make a whole frock did you Well
it willunder some conditions And Sally proudly held up the work of
her hands a nearly finished product at which her friend attired at the
moment in some fifteen yards of silk stared in amazement
Sally Lunn You didntyou couldnt Its not skimpy in the least You
must have pieced out with something else But where
The remains of my old one reenforced underneath and used where the
least wear will come on it Its not an exact match but I dont think it
will show
Show Not a bit But I thought putting old and new wash goods together
wouldnt do
Ive shrunk the new and as I told you reenforced the old with some
very thin cheap lawn I shall wash it myselfwith the ends of my
fingers and my eyes looking the other way Find the old parts
Thus challenged Josephine brought a pair of very bright black eyes to
bear upon the pretty frock turning it over critically and after some
search discovered the resourceful trick which had made the whole lower
half of the skirt and part of the sleeves out of the old muslin
You genius she cried I wish I were half as clever as you She
regarded her friend with the genuine admiration and affection which had
carried the comradeship of the two girls safely through the test of the
Lanes altered fortunes
How good it is to have you back said Sally returning the look You
havent half told me about your winter
Yesbut never mind that just now said Josephine Ive come to hear
about you Jarvis met Max this morning heard the news and told it at
luncheon I simply flew down to show you how glad I am and to hear more
Tell me is it a beautiful old place and shall you go there to live I
suppose Ive seen it but Ive forgotten
Its a forlorn old place dreadfully run down but I want to live in
it The boys wont hear of itas yet Weve only been there once
Were going again Saturdayyou know thats the only time they can all
get away
What fun Cant I go too There must be something nice about it or you
wouldnt want to live there
Theres a locked door in it said Sally smiling as her thoughts
turned to the mystery She described the finding of the door to
Josephine who exclaimed
I must be there to see it opened What do you suppose youll find
Dust and empty shelves Max says Bluebeards murdered wives says Bob
Alec guesses a lot of brokenbacked chairs and a desk with the hinges
off Uncle Timothy thinks it merely leads to the roof But the steps from
the attic do that
What do you think
I think everything admitted Sally from antique mirrors and old
clothes to empty flower pots and battered and rons Im prepared for
anythingexcept the empty shelves Why should the door be locked so
securely if theres nothing behind it
Why indeed I dont know why but my imagination shudders deliciously
at the thought of seeing it opened May I go on Saturday May Jarvis go
He wanted me to ask Hes having a bad time with his eyes again cant
read and pines for something to do A locked closet will interest him
Of course you may both go if youll get Jarvis to promise not to throw
any cold water on my schemes
Hes not likely to discourage any of your schemes you know well enough
Hasnt he always taken your part even against me since we used to
quarrel over which should have the shady side of the sand pile Sun
wont hurt your gipsy face Joey hed say Give Sally the shade like
a gentleman
Both girls laughed Then Sally grew sober Seems to me its only a
little while since Jarvis had his last siege with his eyes she
observed Are they quite as bad again
Hes not shut up in the dark this time but has to wear blue goggles in
the daytime is forbidden reading and writing absolutely for weeks and
goes to Doctor Meyer every other day for treatment Hes getting as
rampageous as a caged lion and vows hell go off to the South Seas or
Labrador or some other place where books and libraries and literary work
wont tantalize him Hed go tomorrow I believe if it werent for
mother She cant bear the idea
It was that last awful years work at college said Sally regretfully
Why did he ever conceive the idea of doing two years work in oneand
why did his friends let him do it
I knowthats what we all say now So does he
Of course he must go Saturday tell him I particularly want him
That will please him Now do tell me about the whole place and
Josephine settled herself to listen
Long before Sally had finished her friend was as eager as herself to
see the old house and was planning with all the help of a vivid
imagination what it would be like when it should be restored When she
went away just before Sally set about getting dinner for her family it
was with assurances that she and her brother would help Sally to the
best of their ability to realize her hopes
This assurance was renewed when on Saturday afternoon the Lanes met the
Burnsides at the appointed hour to take the trolleycar With the
exception of Uncle Timothy they were all there even Max who had
declared his only interest in the place was to sell it But hearing that
Jarvis Burnside was to inspect it he had decided to point out to Jarvis
the impracticability of making a home out of the propertyunless for
some rich man who might be induced to buy it at a figure worth while He
sat beside Jarvis in the car talking to him as Sally could see in a
way intended to prejudice him against the place
But as the party left the car Jarvis joined Sally smiled at her from
behind the ugly goggles which half disguised a face by no means ugly and
said in an undertone
I believe Im in possession of all the facts From now on I intend to
let the fancies have full play
Good for you I knew youd never desert me no matter how much in the
wrong I might be answered Sally gratefully
Jarvis had been a fourth brother to her for so long that it seemed a
matter of course for her to depend upon his support but she appreciated
it when occasionally the real brothers failed to remember how lonely the
young sister was with no mother at hand to love or advise her All but
Bob He the youngest of the family was like a faithful dog always
beside her when the others jeered or reproached and always her
strongest most faithful ally
The walking is better today Sally called out as they started Max
true to his cause promptly denied the truth of this statement Josephine
came to the rescue
Who cares what the walking is like on an April day like this she
challenged Max Isnt the air glorious And wont it be lovely across
the bridge and along the river as soon as the leaves are out
Max was escorting Josephine and as they turned the bend in the road he
pointed out to her the boundary lines of the estate She asked him about
the values of land in this neighbourhood and the possibilities of making
such a place profitable
You sound like a business woman was his comment Thinking of
investing out here You ought to get Sally to talk the place up to
you She estimates that by raising violets on the whole fortytwo
acres and selling them to the florists in town we can be millionaires
the first year
Why not at a dollar a bunch laughed Josephine And think how
picturesque your property will look all a soft purple in the sunshine
Wont it agreed Max There thats the house I suppose youre
prepared to fall into ecstasies with Sally on the doorstep and dance a
reel with her down the hall
Of course I am But what I really came for is the locked door
The door I believe Sallys forgotten the subject of her dreams We
havent a tool any more than we had a week ago
Havent we though shouted Bob from the rear He began to extract
various implements from his pockets on the spot Sally herself waved her
shoppingbag Jarvis Burnside pulled off his glove and began to search
his own pockets
I think well effect an entrance he declared and produced a
curiouslooking skeleton key This will open any ordinary lock
Josephine said everything Sally could have hoped for about the exterior
of the house and a few things more It did seem a little less forlorn
than before the effect perhaps of the April sunshine which lighted
its red brick walls into warm and cheerful hues Jarvis within the door
removed his goggles and blinked approvingly at the fine colonial features
of the woodwork the lines of the stairway and the proportions of the
fireplace
Anybody can see those two are loaded complained Alec in Maxs ear as
they brought up the rear of the procession Trust Jarve Burnside to back
up Sally every time and Josephine to join em Its all right enough for
him to talk about restoration He could do it by putting his hand into
his pocket Between em theyll get Sally completely off her head
Theres no harm in looking the thing over Max replied absently but
Alec continued to rail Bob turned and frowned at him as meaningly as
Bobs round and sunny face could frown Why must Alec follow Maxs lead
he thought One could gain ones point quite as readily and much more
agreeably by being amiable At least this was Bobs philosophy
The door Sally the door urged Josephine as the party finished the
survey of the lower floor I cant take an interest in any more open
rooms while I know theres a closed one waiting Do lead the way up that
impressive staircase and take us straight to the place of mystery
Sallys still young enough to want to save the plums in the cake till
the last said Jarvis as they went up Well well this stairway is
certainly a quaint onerisers about five inches arent they Max
Treads fourteen at least Fine for infants and invalids And comfortable
for sitting out dances Sally
But not so interesting as the five steep steps we are coming to and
Sally led the way down the hall to the side passage from the end of
which rose the little flight which approached the locked door Here we
are Now wholl let us in
It took the combined efforts of Jarvis and Max working with one tool
after another to effect an entrance Clearly this was not an ordinary
closet lock which barred the way But at last with a vigorous wrench
Jarvis held the yielding door under his hand From the top step he waved
his free arm at the company standing below
One last guess apiece he demanded of them before you look
Old seed catalogues and empty hairoil bottles said Alec
A skeleton in armour cried Bob
All your Aunt Alicias balldresses and your Uncle Maxwells wedding
clothes guessed Josephine
A mahogany sideboard diningtable and chairs murmured Sally at which
there was a general shout
Dead beetles fallen plaster and a musty copy of Plutarchs Lives
was Maxs cynical contribution
Open the door cried Bob
But Jarvis still held it I think Ill let in one at a time he
declared Wholl venture first
Sally walked up the steps
