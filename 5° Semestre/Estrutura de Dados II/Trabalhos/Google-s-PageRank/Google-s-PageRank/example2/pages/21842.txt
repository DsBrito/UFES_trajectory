CHAPTER I
WHEN THE SEED TOOK ROOT
I move we go into it fellows
It strikes me as a cracking good idea all right and Im glad Tom
stirred us up after he came back from visiting his cousins over in
Freeport
He says theyve got a dandy troop with three full patrols over
there
No reason Felix why Lenox should be left out in the cold when it
comes to Boy Scout activities Lets keep the ball rolling until its
a sure thing
I say the same Josh Why we can count about enough noses for a full
patrol right among ourselves Theres Tom Chesney to begin with George
Cooper here who ought to make a pretty fair scout even if he is always
finding fault Carl Oskamp also present if we can only tear him away
from his hobby of raising homing pigeons long enough to study up what
scouts have to know yourself Josh Kingsley and a fellow by the name
of Felix Robbins which happens to be me
Thats five to begin with and I might mention Billy Button yes and
Walter Douglass though I guess hed take the premium for a tenderfoot
because he knows next to nothing about outdoor life
But hes willing to learn because he told me so Josh and that
counts a lot you know That makes seven doesnt it Well to complete
the roster of the patrol we might coax Horace Herkimer Crapsey to cast
in his lot with us
The boy named Josh laughed uproariously at the suggestion and his
merriment was shared to some extent by the other two Carl Oskamp
and George Cooper Felix shook his head at them disapprovingly
Just go slow there fellows he told them Because Horace has always
been so afraid of his soft white hands that he wears gloves most of the
time isnt any reason why he shouldnt be made to see the error of his
ways
Oh Felix means that if only we can coax Horace to join we might
reform him exclaimed Josh who was a thin and tall boy with what
might be called a hatchet face typically Yankee
By the same token chuckled Felix in turn a few of us might drop
some of our bad habits if once we subscribed to the rules of the
scouts because Ive read the same in a newspaper They rub it into
fellows who find fault with things instead of being cheerful
Oh is that so Felix burst out George Cooper who took that thrust
to himself How about others who are lazy and always wanting to put
things off to another day Do those same rules say procrastination is
the thief of time
Well boys remarked Carl Oskamp pouring oil on the troubled water as
was his habit weve all got our faults and it might be a good thing
if joining the scouts made us change our ways more or less There comes
Tom now lets get him to tell us something more about the chance for
starting a troop in Lenox right away
He said he believed he knew a young man who might consent to act as
scout master observed Felix Its Mr Robert Witherspoon the civil
engineer and surveyor
Why yes I believe he used to be a scout master in the town he came
from declared Carl I hope Tom is bringing us some good news right
now
If that look on his face counts for anything hes going to give us a
chance to let out a few cheers asserted Felix as the fifth boy drew
near
It was a Friday afternoon near the close of winter when this
conversation took place School was over for the week and as
there was an unmistakable feeling of coming spring in the air
the snow on the ground seemed to be in haste to melt and
disappear
Every now and then one of the boys would be overcome by an irresistible
temptation to stoop gather up enough of the soft clinging snow to make
a hard ball which was thrown with more or less success at some tree or
other object
The town of Lenox was just one of many in the eastern section of the
great United States and boasted a few thousand inhabitants some
industries a high school and various churches In Lenox the boys
were no different from those to be found in every like community
They had a baseball club that vied with rival schools in spirited
contests a football organization and in fact almost every element
that might be expected to thrive in the midst of a lively community
There was however one thing in which the boys of Lenox seemed to have
been lacking and this had been brought home to them when Tom Chesney
came back from his recent visit to Freeport some twenty miles away
Somehow the growing fever among boys to organize scout troops had not
broken out very early in Lenox but if late in coming it bade fair to
make up for lost time by its fierce burning
The boy who now joined the four whose chatter we have just recorded was
a healthy looking chap There was something positive about Tom Chesney
that had always made him a leader with his comrades At the same time
he was never known to assume any airs or to dictate which was all the
more reason why his chums loved him
What luck Tom demanded Josh as soon as the newcomer joined the
others
Its all fixed was the quick answer given by Tom who evidently did
not believe in beating about the bush
Good for you cried Felix Then Mr Witherspoon is willing to
organize the Lenox Troop of Boy Scouts is he Tom
He said he would be glad to have a hand in it replied the other
his only regret being that as he is often called out of town he might
not be able to give the matter all the attention he would like
Thats great news anyhow Tom declared Josh beaming with
satisfaction Weve just been figuring things out and believe
we can find eight fellows who would be willing to make up the
first patrol
We would need that many for a starter commented Tom because
according to the rules he tells me there must be at least one full
patrol before a troop can be started And Im glad you can figure on
enough Its going to make it a success from the start
Theres yourself to begin with remarked Josh counting with his
fingers Felix Walter Douglass George here Billy Button Horace
Crapsey Carl and myself making the eight we need for a patrol
Im glad youre all anxious to join said Tom glancing from one
eager face to the other as they walked slowly down the street in a
group
Why so far as that goes Tom ventured Felix Robbins most of us
are counting the days before we can be wearing our khaki suits and
climbing up out of the tenderfoot bunch to that of secondclass scout
Only Carl here seems to be kind of holding back though none of us can
see why he should want to go and leave his old chums in the lurch
At that Tom gave Carl another look a little more searching than his
first He was immediately struck by the fact that Carl did not seem as
happy as usual He and Tom had been close chums for years That fact
made Tom wonder why the other had not taken him into his confidence if
there was anything wrong
Carl must have known that the eyes of his chum were upon him for he
flushed and then looked hastily up
Oh it isnt that I wouldnt be mighty glad of the chance to go into
this thing with the rest of you he hastened to say dont believe
that Im getting tired of my old chums It isnt that at all But
something has happened to make me think I may be kept so busy that Id
have no time to give to studying up scout laws and attending meetings
Oh forget it all Carl and come in with us urged Josh laying a
hand affectionately on the others shoulder If its anything where we
can help you know as well as you do your own name that there isnt a
fellow but would lay himself out to stand back of you Isnt that so
boys
Three other voices instantly joined in to declare that they would only
be glad of the opportunity to show Carl how much they appreciated him
It always touches a boy to find out how much his chums think of him
There was a suspicious moisture about Carls eyes as he smiled and
nodded his head when replying
Thats nice of you fellows But after all perhaps I may see my way
clear to joining the troop I hope so anyway and Ill try my best
to make the riffle Now Tom tell us all Mr Witherspoon said
Yes we want to know what wed have to do the first thing added
Josh who was about as quick to start things as Felix Robbins was
slow I sent off and got a scout manual It came last night and
Im soaking up the contents at a great rate
That was why I saw a light over in your room late last night was it
George Cooper demanded Burning the midnight oil Must have been
interesting reading seems to me Josh
I could hardly tear myself away from the book responded the other
boy After tonight Ill loan it to the rest of you though I guess
Tom must have got one from Mr Witherspoon for I see something bulging
in his pocket
Tom laughed at that
Josh he said its very plain to me that you will make a pretty
clever scout because youve got the habit of observing things down to
a fine point And if youve read as much as you say of course you know
that one of the first things a tenderfoot has to do is to remember to
keep his eyes about him and see things
Yes added Josh eagerly one test is for each boy to stand in front
of a store window for just two minutes making a mental map of the
same and then go off to jot down as many objects as he can remember
to have seen there
Thats quite a stunt remarked Felix thoughtfully and I reckon the
one who can figure out the biggest number of articles goes up head in
the class I must remember and practice that game It strikes me as
worth while
Listen to the row up there will you burst out George Cooper just
then Why that lot of boys seems to be having a snowball fight dont
they Hello it isnt a battle after all but theyre pelting somebody
or other See how the balls fly like a flock of pigeons from Carls
coop
It looks like a man theyre bombarding ejaculated Felix
Youre right about that and an old man in the bargain added Tom
as he quickened his steps involuntarily I can see that bully Tony
Pollock leading the lot yes and the other fellows must be his
cronies Wedge McGuffey and Asa Green
See the poor old fellow try to dodge the balls exclaimed Josh
Theyre making them like ice too and I wouldnt put it past that lot
to pack a stone in each snowball in the bargain Theyd be equal to
anything
Are we going to stand by and see that sport go on boys asked Carl
as he shut his jaws tight together and the light of indignation shone
in his eyes
We wouldnt be fit to wear the khaki of scouts if we did fellows
cried Tom Chesney Come on and lets give them a taste of their own
medicine and with loud shouts the five comrades started to gather up
the snow as they chased pellmell toward the scene of excitement
CHAPTER II
THE MAN WHO LOVED NATURE
Give it to them boys Josh was shouting as he started to send his
first ball straight at the group of busy tormentors who were showering
the helpless old man with their icy balls that must have stung almost
as much as so many rocks
He seemed to be lame for while he tried to advance toward the young
rascals waving his stout cane wildly they had no difficulty in keeping
a safe distance off and continuing the cruel bombardment
The smashing of that ball flung by Josh who was pitcher on the Lenox
baseball team and a fine shot was the first intimation the three
tormentors of the old man had that the tables had been turned
Hey look here whats on to us shrilled one of the trio as he felt
the sudden shock caused by the first snowball striking the back of his
head
Upon that the bully of the town and his two allies were forced to turn
and try to defend themselves against this assault from the rear They
fought desperately for a very short time but their hands were already
half frozen and five against three proved too great odds for their
valor
Besides every time Josh let fly he managed to land on some part of the
person of Tony Pollock or one of his cronies And those hard balls when
driven by the sturdy arm of the baseball pitcher stung mercilessly
The old man stood and watched with something like a smile on his face
He seemed to have forgotten all about his own recent predicament in
seeing these young rowdies receiving their just dues If he had not
been old and lame possibly he might have insisted on joining in the
fray and adding to the punishment being meted out to the three
cowardly boys
Once a retreat was begun it quickly merged into a regular panic Tom
stayed to talk to the old man while his comrades pursued the fleeing
trio and peppered them good and hard When finally they felt that they
had amply vindicated their right to be reckoned worthy candidates for
scout membership they came back laughing heartily among themselves
to where Tom and the old man were standing
Why Ive seen that old fellow before Josh remarked in a low
tone as he and Carl George and Felix drew near His name is Larry
Henderson and they say hes something of a hermit living away up in
the woods beyond Bear Mountain
Sure thing added Felix instantly Ive heard my folks talking
about him lots of times He does a little trapping they say but
spends most of his time studying animated nature He knows every animal
that ever lived on this continent and the birds and insects too I
reckon Hes as smart as they make em and used to be a college
professor some people say even if he does talk a little rough now
For some reason all of them were feeling more or less interest in the
man who walked with a cane Perhaps this arose from the fact that of
late they had become enthusiastic over everything connected with
woodcraft And the fact that Mr Henderson was acquainted with a
thousand secrets about the interesting things to be discovered in the
Great Outdoors appealed strongly to them
These are my chums Mr Henderson said Tom when the others came up
and as the name of each one was mentioned the hermit of Bear Mountain
grasped his hand giving a squeeze that made some of the boys wince
Im glad to meet you all he said heartily It was worth being
attacked by that lot of rowdies just to get acquainted with such a fine
lot of boys And I want to say that you gave them all the punishment
they deserved I counted hits until I lost all track of the number
Yes said Felix with a grin on his freckled face theyre rubbing
many a sore spot right now I reckon Josh here whos our star pitcher
on the nine never wasted a single ball And I could hear the same
fairly whistle through the air
Gosh all hemlock Felix objected the boy mentioned youre
stretching things pretty wide arent you Now I guess the rest
of you did your share in the good work just as much as I
All the same Im thankful for your coming to my assistance said
Mr Henderson My rheumatism kept me from being as spry in dodging
their cannonade as I might have been some years ago And one ball
that broke against that tree had a stone inside it Im sorry to
say We would have called that unsportsmanlike in my young days
Only the meanest kind of a fellow would descend to such a trick
exclaimed the indignant Josh but then Tony Pollock and his crowd
are ready to do anything lowdown and crooked Theyll never be
able to join our scout troop after we get it started
Whats that you are saying asked the old man showing sudden
interest
Why you see sir explained Josh always ready to do his share
of talking if given half a chance our chum here Tom Chesney was
visiting his cousins over in Freeport and got interested in their
scout troop So weve taken the thing up and expect to start the
ball rolling right away
It happens Tom went on that there is a young man in town who once
served as scout master in a troop and Ive just had him promise to
come around tonight and tell us what weve got to do to get the
necessary charter from scout headquarters
You interest me very much boys said Mr Henderson his eyes
sparkling as he spoke I have read considerable about the wonderful
progress this new movement is making all over the land and I want to
say that I like the principles it advocates Boys have known too little
in the past of how to take care of themselves at all times and also be
ready to lend a helping hand to others
The camping out and finding all sorts of queer things in the woods
is what makes me want to join a troop said Josh because I always
did love to fish and hunt and get off in the mountains away from
everybody
Thats a good foundation to start on remarked the hermit with
kindling eyes as he looked from one eager face to another but I
imagine that after youve been a scout for a short time your ideas
will begin to change considerably
How sir asked Josh looking unconvinced
Well continued the old man softly youll find such enjoyment in
observing the habits of all the little woods folks that by degrees
the fierce desire you have now to slay them will grow colder In the
end most of you will consider it ten times better to sit and watch them
at their labors or play than to slaughter them in sport or even to
kill them for food
But Mr Henderson said Josh boldly Ive heard that you trap
animals for their pelts and I guess you must knock a few over when
you feel like having game for dinner dont you
Occasionally I go out and get a rabbit or a partridge though not
often admitted the old man and as for my trapping I only try to
take such animals or vermin as are cruel in their nature and seem to
be a pest to the innocent things Im so fond of having around me I
wish you boys could visit my cabin some time or other and make the
acquaintance of my innumerable pets They look on me as their best
friend and I would never dream of raising a hand to injure them
Kindness to animals I believe is one of the cardinal principles
of a true scout
Yes sir thats what it is responded Josh eagerly Ive got the
whole twelve points of scout law on the tip of my tongue right now
Heres what they are A scout has got to be trustworthy loyal
helpful friendly courteous kind obedient cheerful thrifty
brave clean and reverent
Whew thats going some declared Felix who being prone to put
things off to a more convenient season could readily see that he
was sure to run up against a good many snags if he tried to keep
the scout law
Then you can easily understand continued Mr Henderson what a
treasurehouse the woods is going to be to every observing boy who
spends some time there and becomes interested in seeing all that
is going on around him
Im sure of that sir responded Tom earnestly I know for one that
Ive never paid a quarter of the attention to such things as I ought to
have done
No you are right there my lad the hermit continued being
evidently on a favorite subject the average boy can walk through
a mile of forest and hardly notice anything around him In fact he
may even decide that its only a gloomy place and outside the cawing
of the crows or perhaps an occasional squirrel at which he shies a
stone he has heard and seen nothing
Then its different with a scout is it sir asked George Cooper
If he has been aroused to take a keen interest in nature the same
woods will be alive with interesting things the other told them He
will see the shy little denizens peeping curiously out at him from a
cover of leaves and hear their low excited chattering as they tell
each other what they think of him Every tree and mosscovered stone
and swinging wild grapevine will tell a story and afterwards that
boy is going to wonder how he ever could have been content to remain
in such dense ignorance as he did for years
Mr Henderson do you expect to remain in town over night asked Tom
suddenly
Why yes I shall have to stay until tomorrow came the reply I
am stopping with my old friend Judge Stone We attended the same red
school house on the hill a great many years ago My stock of provisions
ran short sooner than I had counted on and this compelled me to come
down earlier than usual As a rule I deal over in Fairmount but this
time it was more convenient to come here Why do you ask Tom
I was wondering whether you could be coaxed to come around tonight
and meet the rest of the boys the boy told him We expect to have a
dozen present and when Mr Witherspoon is explaining what a scout must
subscribe to in joining a troop it might influence some of the fellows
if you would tell them a few things like those you were just describing
to us
The old naturalist looked at the eager faces of the five lads and a
smile came over his own countenance Undoubtedly he was a lover of and
believer in boys no matter whether he had ever had any of his own or
not
I shall be only too pleased to come around Tom if Judge Stone can
run his car by moonlight Tell me where the meeting is to take place
The deacons of the church have promised to let us have a room in the
basement which has a stove in it The meeting will be at eight
oclock sir Tom informed him
I hope to be there and listen to what goes on said the hermit And
after all Im not sorry those vicious boys thought to bombard me the
way they did since it has given me the opportunity to get acquainted
with such a fine lot of lads But I see my friend the Judge coming
with his car and Ill say goodbye to you all for the present
He waved his hand to them as he rode away beside the whitebearded
judge who was one of the most highly respected citizens of Lenox
Well hes a mighty fine sort of an old party for a fact declared
George as they looked after the receding car nor did he mean the
slightest disrespect in speaking in this fashion of the interesting old
man they had met in such a strange way
Id give something if only I could visit Mr Henderson at his cabin
remarked Felix I reckon he must have a heap of things worth seeing in
his collection
Who knows said Tom cheerily but what some good luck might take us
up that way one of these fine days
Lets hope so added Josh as they once more started toward home
CHAPTER III
A CLOUD OVER THE OSKAMP HOME
Tom and Carl walked along together after the other three boys had
dropped off at various stages taking shortcuts for their homes
as suppertime was approaching
Whats gone wrong Carl asked Tom as he flung an arm across the
shoulders of his closest chum
I was meaning to tell you about it Tom explained the other
quickly but somehow I kept holding back It seemed as if I ought
to find a way of solving that queer mystery myself But only this
morning I decided to ask you to help me
His words aroused the curiosity of the other boy more than ever
Whats this youre talking about he exclaimed A mystery is there
now Carl Why I thought it might all be about that coming around so
often of Mr Amasa Culpepper who not only keeps the grocery store but
is a sort of shyster lawyer and a money lender as well Everybody
says hes smitten with your mother and wants to be a second father
to you and your sisters and brothers
Well that used to worry me a whole lot admitted Carl frankly
until I asked my mother if she cared any for Amasa She laughed at me
and said that if he was the last man on earth she would never dream of
marrying him In fact she never expected to stop being John Oskamps
widow So since then I only laugh when I see old Amasa coming around
and fetching big bouquets of flowers from his garden which he must
hate to pull hes so miserly
Then what else has cropped up to bother you Carl asked Tom
The other heaved a longdrawn sigh
My mother is worried half sick over it he explained shes hunted
every bit of the house over several times and Ive scoured the garden
again and again but we dont seem to be able to locate it at all Its
the queerest thing where it could have disappeared to so suddenly
Yes but you havent told me what it is remarked Tom
A paper Tom a most valuable paper that my mother carelessly left on
the table in the sitting room day before yesterday
What kind of a paper was it asked Tom who always liked to get at
the gist of things in the start
Why it was a paper that meant considerable to my mother explained
Carl My father once invested in some shares of oil stock The
certificate of stock was in the safe keeping of Amasa Culpepper who
had given a receipt for the same and a promise to hand over the
original certificate when this paper was produced
And you say the receipt disappeared from the table in your sitting
room without anybody knowing what became of it asked Tom
Yes replied Carl This is how it came about Lately we received
word that the company had struck some gushers in the way of wells and
that the stock my father had bought for a few cents a share is worth a
mint of money now It was through Amasa Culpepper my mother first
learned about this and she wrote to the company to find out
Oh I see chuckled Tom and when Mr Culpepper learned that there
was a chance of your mother becoming rich his unwelcome attentions
became more pronounced than ever isnt that so Carl
I think youre right Tom said the other boy but without smiling
for he carried too heavy a load on his mind to feel merry You see my
mother had hunted up this precious receipt and had it handy meaning
to go over to Mr Culpeppers office in the forenoon and ask for the
certificate of stock he has in his safe
So she laid it on the table did she pursued Tom shaking his head
Dont you think that it was a little careless Carl in your mother
to do that
She cant forgive herself for doing it replied his chum sadly She
says that it just shows how few women have any business qualities about
them and that she misses my father more and more every day that she
lives But none of the other children touched the paper Angus Elsie
and Dot have told her so straight and its a puzzle to know what did
become of it
You spoke of hunting in the garden and around the outside of the
house why should you do that
It happened that one of the sitting room windows was open half a foot
that day The weather had grown mild you remember explained the
other
And you kind of had an idea the paper might have blown out through
that open window was that it
It looked like it to me answered the widows son frowning but
if that was what happened the wind carried it over the fence and far
away because Ive not been able to find anything of it
How long was it between the time your mother laid the paper on the
table and the moment she missed it continued Tom Chesney
Just one full hour She went from the breakfast table and got the
paper out of her trunk Then when she had seen the children off to
school and dressed to go out it was gone She said that was just a
quarter to ten
Shes sure of that is she demanded Tom
Yes replied Carl because the grocers boy always comes along at
