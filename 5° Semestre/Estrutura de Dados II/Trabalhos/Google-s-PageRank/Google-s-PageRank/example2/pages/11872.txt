THE SPOILSPORT
Mr Phillybag was demobilised The Day had come For months he had
dreamed of the possibilityhad imagined the joy and alacrity with
which he would doff his cap tunic and trousers service dress one
each and resume the decent broadcloth of a successful City solicitor
Strangely enough however once he was actually demobilised he
found himself in no hurry to lose the garb which showed that he Mr
Phillybag had helped you know to put the kybosh on the KAISER He
was proud too of the corporals stripes which he had gained in a very
short Army career
That explains why he was in uniform this morning in his office when
he opened a letter from Ernest Williams his former junior clerk He
remembered Williams wellhow in the early days of the War that youth
had seen Lord KITCHENER point his finger from the hoardings at him
and there and then discovering that the Ordnance Department possessed
a cap size 678 which fitted him had followed instructions and
immediately commenced to wear it Now he had written to Mr Phillybag
to inform him that as he expected to be demobilised shortly he was
calling at eleven oclock to discuss the question of reentering his
employ
Mr Phillybag rubbed his hands together in satisfaction He was
looking forward to the interview Since Armistice Day he had read
every article he could find written on the subject of demobilisation
and its humours consequently he knew exactly what he was expected
to do When Williams entered in all the glory of a Captains stars
perhaps even a Majors crown the ribbon of the DSO or the MC or
both on his breast he Corporal Phillybag would spring smartly to
attention salute and address his junior clerk as Sir
He chuckled with delight as he visualised the piquant scene Reseating
himself he would briskly resume his interrupted work for a moment
while be kept his superior officer waiting Then
Mr Williams to see you Sir said one of his clerks
Show him in at once
On his appearance Mr Phillybag suffered a slight recoil but
recovered himself quickly and exchanged embarrassed greetings An
awkward pause followed At length Mr Phillybag broke it
Williams he said severely Im surprised at you Who ever heard
of an employee returning to civil life from the Army with a lower
rank than the one his employer holds Four years in khaki and only a
lancecorporal Youve spoiled my whole morning Its men with
careers like yours who make the profession of humorous journalism so
precarious
A SOUVENIR OF COLOGNE
Am I really awake or is it all a beautiful dream I said pinching
myself to make sure
At the other end of the room an unmistakably German band was playing
Roses of Picardy while all around me German waiters were running
about deferentially with trays in their hands Even as I wondered one
of them approached and laid the bill on my table with a friendly smile
and Tree mark bleesir
Then I remembered that I was at the British Officers Club in Cologne
How interested they will be at home I thought when they know
where I am And of course I must send them souvenirs of my Watch on
the Rhine and thoughtfully I produced from my pocket some local
tramtickets kept for the younger members of the family and patted
a box of twopenny cigars encouragingly These I was going to send to
my brother
Then I rose and paying the bill went out to purchase a suitable
memento for a younger sister Slowly I wandered along the crowded
Hohestrasse in the direction of the Opera House peering into the
shopwindows for something redolent of the land I was in Presently
a brightlooking sweetshop attracted me The window contained a
beautiful selection of chocolateboxes with pictures of the Cathedral
or the Rhine Maidens on the lids In I went and selected a handsome
sample bound with red plush and bordered with seashells But it was
empty Nix sweets said the girl behind the counter and offered me
the alternative of a bun Nothing doing and I passed on
Further along the street I stopped before a chemists shop to regard
a huge pyramid of bottles of eaudeCologne displayed in the window
The very thing I said to myself What more appropriate souvenir
than a bottle of the local produce
That was ten days ago and this morning I received the following
letter
Thank you so much for the scent it was sweet of you and
arrived safely only I dont think it quite so nice as the real
eaudeCologne which I buy at Browns shop Brown is the village
grocer for threeandnine a bottle And he says they must have taken
you in properly with a German imitation called eaudeKoeln and
expects you had to pay a pretty penny for it though I hope you
didnt poor boy

FOR OUR EVENING DRESS
THE BLUE HAT
Nancy came softly into my study and stood at the side of the desk
where I was busy with some work on account of which I had stayed away
from the office that morning
Do you like it she said
I felt a momentary anxiety as I looked up I had made a bad mistake
only a little time before having waxed enthusiastic over what I took
to be a new blouse when it was a question of hairdressing the blouse
having been worn by my wife so she solemnly averred every evening
for the last two months
But this time no mistake was possible You dont go about the house at
eleven oclock on a cold Spring morning fancifully arrayed in a pale
blue hat with white feathery things sticking out all round it unless
there is a particular reason for so doing
I think its a delightful hat I said and suits you splendidly
But I thought you never wore blue
I dont said Nancy thats what makes me rather doubtful I didnt
really mean to buy it at all I went in to Margueritesyou know
that heavenly shop at the corner of the squareI nodded of course
I knew Margueritesto ask the price of a jadegreen jumper they
had in the windowoh my dear a perfect angel of a jumperand they
showed me this That redhaired assistant almost made me buy it
said she had never seen me in a hat that suited me so well and really
it wasnt so very dear But I was a little doubtful However
She was quite right I said very decidedly Did you get the
whatyoumaycallitthe other thing
Nancys face expressed poignant anguish
Twelve guineas she said I simply couldnt run to it Of course I
was heartbroken Still it wasnt as if I really needed anything just
now It would have been ridiculous extravagance But it really was an
angel
She turned to go stopping a moment on the way out to have another
look at herself in the little round mirror over the mantelpiece
Im not quite happy about it I heard her murmur as she went out
The next morning I found a letter waiting for me at the office which
brought me news of a totally unexpected windfall of some fifty odd
pounds It was a sunny morning too with a distinct feeling of Spring
in the air
I felt like being extravagant and my mind flew at once to Nancy and
her jadegreenwhat was the name of the thingthat she had wanted
so badly
I left the office early and on my way home managed to summon up
sufficient courage to carry me through the discreetly curtained doors
of Madame Marguerites recherche establishment devoutly hoping that
the nervous sinking which I felt about my heart was not reflected in
my outer demeanour
The redhaired girl in spite of a curiously detached and supercilious
air as who should say Take it or leave it it concerns me not in
the least which at first rather alarmed me was really quite kind
and helpful
Something in jadegreen that Moddom admired A hat perhaps
No I knew it was not a hat I murmured something about twelve
guineas This seemed to be enlightening
Ah yes a jumper probably They had had a jadegreen jumper at that
price she believed If I would sit down for a moment she would send
someone to see if it were still unsold
I felt very anxious while I waited but the emissary presently
returned with the garment over her arm
Yes that was undoubtedly the one She remembered how much Moddom had
admired it It had suited Moddom so well too
While it was being packed up for I decided to take it with me a
small boy arrived with several hatboxes which he put down on the
floor
Redhair proceeded to unpack them carefully almost reverently
extracting the hats from the folds of surrounding tissuepaper and
placing them one by one in various cupboards and drawers Presently
she drew forth from one of the boxesI felt sure I was not
mistakenthat very blue hat which I had admired only the day before
upon the head of my wife
I gave an involuntary exclamation Redhair looked at me
Surely I said feeling inwardly rather proud at recognising it
againsurely that hat is exactly like one that my wife bought
yesterday
Redhair was hurt It is the same hat she said coldly We never
make two models alike
I tried to mollify her I cant understand her sending it back I
said I think its an extremely pretty hat and it suits her so well
But perhaps there was some alteration necessary It may not have quite
fitted or something
Redhead dived gracefully into the box and drew forth a note from the
tissuepaper billows
A faint flicker expressive of I knew not what hidden emotion seemed to
pass for one moment over her aristocratic features as she read it But
it vanished instantaneously and she turned to me with her previous
air of haughty and imperturbable aloofness
Moddom is not keeping the hat she said
I felt somehow a little snubbed and said no more and my parcel
appearing at this moment I paid and departed
Nancys joy over the jumper more than came up to my expectations When
she had calmed down a little I bethought myself of the matter of the
hat
Oh yes said Nancy in reply to my question I sent it back after
all It wont matter in the least now that you have bought this
But why didnt you keep it I said
Well I really felt I didnt like it so very much said Nancy and
as you didnt seem quite to like it either
My dear girl I protested I told you I thought it was charming
Well anyway you said that blue didnt suit me persisted my wife
You did George
There was a moments pause It was no use saying anything Suddenly
Nancy jumped up and clutched me by the arm
George she said anxiously you didnt you didnt say anything
about that hat to the girl in the shop did you
I believe I mentioned that I thought it was extremely pretty and
that I was sorry you werent keeping it I replied airily But why
For my wifes face had suddenly assumed an expression of horrified
dismay
I shall never be able to go into that shop again she wailed
never I wrote them a note saying that I was not keeping the hat
because my husband very much disliked it and that I didnt care
ever to wear anything of which he didnt approve
What is really very unfair about the whole thing is that I know
that Nancy thinks me entirely to blame Indeed she told me so When
I ventured to point out that she had not been quite truthful in
the matter she was at first genuinely and honestly amazed and
subsequently so indignant that I was fain ultimately to apologise
In looking back upon the episode I am filled with admiration for
the redhaired girl I consider that she showed extraordinary
selfrestraint in what must have been a peculiarly tempting situation

RH LOOKS TO ME LIKE A CHEMISTS SHOP SIR
SMALLTALK
Of course you must come said Mary its nonsense to say you cant
dance
Mary is married to my first cousin Thomas I looked at Thomas but
saw no hope of support Thomas labours under the delusion that he can
jazz
It isnt only the dancing I protested its the conversational
strain Besides as one of the original founders of the League to
Minimise Gossip amongst General Staff Officers
Rot said Thomas you simply let your partners do the talking
You neednt even listen Just say Quite in your most official tone
whenever you hear them saying nothing
Thomas although my first cousin is not bright but I had to go
For the first few dances I escaped the crowd round the door was
so dense that I saw at once that I should be trampled to death if
I attempted to enter Then I was caught by Mary and introduced to
a total stranger
I suppose there are people who do not mind kicking a total stranger
round the room to the strain of cymbals a motor siren and a
fryingpan I fancy the lady expressed a desire to stop but as her
words were lost in the orchestral pandemonium I realised that as long
as the dulcet chords continued conversation was impossible so we
danced on
Fortunately too when the interval came she was full of smalltalk
Isnt the floor good And I always like this band
Quite said I
Rather sporting of the SmytheJoneses to give a dance
Quite said I
Especially when their eldest boy the one you know who was so
frightfully good at golf or something has just got into a mess
with
Quite said I while she plunged into a flood of reminiscences
She did not ask whether I could jazz mainly I think because I had
already danced with her I concentrated my thoughts on the best means
of avoiding Mary when the music began again and just threw in an
occasional Quite to keep the lady in a good temper
But there was no escaping Mary
You must go and dance with Miss Carter she told me adducing
incontrovertible arguments I am terrified of Miss Carter who can
only be described as statuesque and always does the right thing
which makes her crushing to the verge of discourtesy I am always
being asked if I know whether she is only twentytwo It was not
without satisfaction that I initiated her into my style of dancing
To my horror when we stopped she sat in silence regarding me with
an air of expectant boredom I racked my brains
Good floor isnt it said I
Quite said Miss Carter
Jolly good band too
Quite said Miss Carter
And rather sporting of the SmytheJoneses dont you think
She said it again By this time I felt convinced that all the other
couples within hearing were listening to us Miss Carter is that sort
of person
Of course I said with a nervous laugh its rather absurd for me
to say anything about it because you know dancing isnt much in my
line
Quite said Miss Carter
That settled it I felt I must stop her at all costs I cleared my
throat and spoke as distinctly as I could
Im always being asked a conundrum Miss Carter and youre the one
person who can tell me the true answer Am I permitted to ask it
Quite said Miss Carter for the first time almost smiling I
plucked up courage
Its this how old are you
She stopped herself just in time Her answer was given in a tone
which expressed at the same time her contempt for my breach of the
conventions and the fact that she was too indifferent to think me
worth snubbing
Twentytwo said she
Quite said I

THE CAREER POSTPONED
MY DEAR JAMESA few weeks ago I wrote to tell you that ere long the
military machine would be able to spare one of its cogsmyself I
discussed possible careers in civil life and since then I had almost
decided on filbertgrower Had things gone well by the beginning of
June you should have received a first instalment of forced filberts
Now this cannot be The cog is shown to be indispensable I must
remain a soldier
Why do they want me James I am nothing like a soldier I cannot
click my heels as other men do I try Heaven knows how I try but all
the CO hears is a sound as of two cabbages being slapped together
And my word of command The critics say it is like a cry for help in
a London fog
My haversack contains no trace of any FieldMarshals baton You are
aware that every private soldiers haversack is issued complete with
Batons one FieldMarshal potential for the use of But there is
no authority for such an issue for commissioned ranks
Is it because of my manner with men and my powers as a disciplinarian
I fear not If a man is brought before me for summary jurisdiction a
lump rises in my throat and I want to cry I am always sure he didnt
mean to do it As for military law I am shaky on the fines for
drunkenness and I dont feel at all sure whether death at dawn or two
extra fatigues is the maximum punishment for having one string of the
holdall longer than the other when on active service
When I kicked the bellpush towards the end of last guestnight the
Adjutant said he should mark me down for the job of Physical Training
Officer but I hope he was only joking I am not built for the work
My frame is puny and my countenance irresolute I hate bending and
stretching my arms they creak and frighten me I never could squat on
my heels like a thingummy
I might if allowed make a hit as Messing Officer With the aid of
my Cookery Course notes I can differentiate between no fewer than
thirtyfour different types of rissole Unfortunately we already have
a Messing Officer of deadly efficiency He can classify dripping by
instinct He can memorise at sight all the revolting contents of a
swilltub My rissole lore is a poor asset in comparison
No James I think I have it One day you will read that our Armies
of Occupation consist of so many hundred thousands of all ranks
including perhaps 35001 officers That is why they retain me
I shall be the 1 at the end of the thousands It is your humble
servants function to keep the Armies of Occupation up to strength
Are we to be robbed of the fruits of victory The reply is in the
negative Therefore when next June comes along and you yearn for
the early filberts do not be fretty Remember that I am gathering
in fruits of another and a nobler kind Yours ever

His voice was gay his eye was bright

PEACE TERMS
BEING SOME LETTERS OF MRS PARTINGTON TO HER SISTER
Conferences between mistresses and servants are being held in
various parts of the country to discuss terms of peace in the
domestic world
Puddleford
DEAR MOIRAWe havent got a servant yet but we are clutching at
a new hope There is to be a conference here between mistresses
and maids to discuss and readjust the servants rights and the
mistresses wrongsor is it the other way about Anyhow I shall
attend that conference I shall bribe plead consent to any
arrangement if I can but net a cookgeneral Ten months of doing
my own washingup has brought me to my knees while Harry says the
performance of menial duties has crushed his spirit
Of course Harry does make such a fuss of things You might think to
hear him talk that the getting up of coal lighting fires chopping
wood and cleaning flues was the entire work of a household instead
of being mere incidents in the daily routine If he had to tackle my
dutiesbut men never seem to understand how much there is to do in a
house
I will tell you about the conference when I write again
Yours always DODO
Puddleford
DEAR MOIRAThe conference was a most interesting affair the one
going on in Paris could never be half so thrilling There was a goodly
attendance of servants and they had their own spokeswoman We spoke
for ourselvesthose of us who were not too dazed at the sight of so
many treasures almost within our grasp
What the servants wanted was not unreasonable They chiefly demanded a
certain time to themselves during the day with fixed hours for meals
