INTRODUCTION
The Secret Memoirs of Henry of Navarres famous queen possess
a value which the passage of time seems but to heighten Emanating
as they undoubtedly do from one of the chief actors in a momentous
crisis in French history and in the religious history of Europe
as well their importance as firsthand documents can hardly
be overestimated While the interest which attaches to their
intimate discussions of people and manners of the day will appeal
to the reader at the outset
Marguerite de Valois was the French contemporary of Queen Elizabeth
of England and their careers furnish several curious points of
parallel Marguerite was the daughter of the famous Catherine
de Medicis and was given in marriage by her scheming mother
to Henry of Navarre whose ascendant Bourbon star threatened
to eclipse as afterwards it did the waning house of Valois
Catherine had four sons three of whom successively mounted the
throne of France but all were childless Although the king of
the petty state of Navarre was a Protestant and Catherine was
the most fanatical of Catholics she made this marriage a pretext
for welding the two houses but actually it seems to have been
a snare to lure him to Paris for it was at this precise time
that the bloody Massacre of St Bartholomews day was ordered
Henry himself escapedit is said through the protection of
Marguerite his bridebut his adherents in the Protestant party
were slain by the thousands A wedded life begun under such
sanguinary auspices was not destined to end happily Indeed their
marriage resembled nothing so much as an armed truce peaceable
and allowing both to pursue their several paths and finally
dissolved by mutual consent in 1598 when Queen Marguerite was
fortyfive The closing years of her life were spent in strict
seclusion at the Castle of Usson in Auvergne and it was at
this time that she probably wrote her Memoirs
In the original the Memoirs are written in a clear vigorous
French and in epistolary form Their first editor divided them into
three sections or books As a whole they cover the secret history
of the Court of France from the years 1565 to 1582seventeen years
of extraordinary interest comprising as they do the Massacre of
St Bartholomew already referred to the formation of the famous
League the Peace of Sens and the bitter religious persecutions
which were at last ended by the Edict of Nantes issued after Henry
of Navarre became Henry IV of France Besides the political
bearing of the letters they give a picturesque account of Court
life at the end of the 16th century the fashions and manners
of the time piquant descriptions and amusing gossip such as
only a witty womanas Marguerite certainly wascould inject
into such subjects The letters indeed abound in sprightly
anecdote and smalltalk which yet have their value in lightening
up the whole situation
The period covered coincides very nearly with the first half
of Marguerites own life Incidents of her girlhood are given
leading to more important matters personal and political up
to the twentyninth year of her age The letters end therefore
some seven years prior to the death of her brother Henry III
of France and while she was still merely Queen of Navarre It
will always be a matter of regret that the latter half of her
life was not likewise covered
These Memoirs first appeared in printed form in 1628 thirteen
years after their authors death They enjoyed great popularity
and in 1656 were translated into English and published in London
with the following erroneous title The grand Cabinet Counsels
unlocked or the most faithful Transaction of Court Affairs and
Growth and Continuance of the Civil Wars in France during the
Reigns of Charles the last Henry III and Henry IV commonly
called the Great Most excellently written in the French Tongue
by Margaret de Valois Sister to the two first Kings and Wife of
the last Faithfully translated by Robert Codrington Master of
Arts Two years later the work was again translated this time
under the title of Memorials of Court Affairs The misleading
portion of Codringtons title is in regard to the reign of Henry
IV As already shown the letters cease before that time although
chronicling many events of his early career The present careful
translation has been made direct from the original adhering
as closely as permissible to the rugged but clearcut verbal
expressions of 16th century France
Queen Marguerite herself is described by historians and novelists
as a singularly attractive woman both physically and mentally
Of a little above the average height her figure was wellrounded
and graceful her carriage dignified and commanding One writer
thus describes her Her eyes were full black and sparkling
she had bright chestnutcoloured hair and complexion fresh and
blooming Her skin was delicately white and her neck admirably
well formed and this so generally admired beauty the fashion
of dress in her time admitted of being fully displayed To
her personal charms were added a ready wit and polished manners
Her thoughts whether spoken or written were always clearly
and gracefully expressed In her retirement at the close of
her life she often amused herself by writing verses which she
set to music and afterwards sang accompanying herself upon the
lute which she performed upon skilfully
Regarding her personal character there has been diversity of
opinionas indeed there has been in the case of nearly every
exalted personage After her separation from the king she was the
subject of a scandalous attack entitled Le Divorce Satyrique ou
les Amours de la Reyne Marguerite de Valois but this anonymous
libel was never seriously considered M Pierre de Bourdeville
Sieur de Brantome better known by the final name who gives
many facts concerning her later life in his Anecdotes des Rois
de France is a staunch adherent of hers Ronsard the Court
poet is also extravagant in his praises of her but chiefly of
her beauty Numerous other poets and romancers have found her
life a favourite subject Meyerbeers opera Les Huguenots
is based upon her wedding and the ensuing Massacre Dumass
wellknown novel Marguerite de Valois gives her a somewhat
dubious reputation as halftool halfagent for Catherine and
as the mistress of the historical La Mole This doubtful phase
however if true was but in keeping with the fashion of the
times It is mentioned merely as a possible line completing the
portrait of this brilliant woman who lives again for us in the
pages of her Memoirs
ON MARGUERITE DE VALOIS
QUEEN OF NAVARRE
Dear native land and you proud castles say
Where grandsire1 father2 and three brothers3 lay
Who each in turn the crown imperial wore
Me will you own your daughter whom you bore
Me once your greatest boast and chiefest pride
By Bourbon and Lorraine4 when sought a bride
Now widowed wife5 a queen without a throne
Midst rocks and mountains6 wander I alone
Nor yet hath Fortune vented all her spite
But sets one up7 who now enjoys my right
Points to the boy8 who henceforth claims the throne
And crown a son of mine should call his own
But ah alas for me tis now too late9
To strive gainst Fortune and contend with Fate
Of those I slighted can I beg relief10
No let me die the victim of my grief
And can I then be justly said to live
Dead in estate do I then yet survive
Last of the name I carry to the grave
All the remains the House of Valois have

THE MEMOIRS OF MARGUERITE DE VALOIS
LETTER I
I should commend your work much more were I myself less praised
in it but I am unwilling to do so lest my praises should seem
rather the effect of selflove than to be founded on reason and
justice I am fearful that like Themistocles I should appear
to admire their eloquence the most who are most forward to praise
me It is the usual frailty of our sex to be fond of flattery I
blame this in other women and should wish not to be chargeable
with it myself Yet I confess that I take a pride in being painted
by the hand of so able a master however flattering the likeness
may be If I ever were possessed of the graces you have assigned
to me trouble and vexation render them no longer visible and
have even effaced them from my own recollection So that I view
myself in your Memoirs and say with old Madame de Rendan who
not having consulted her glass since her husbands death on
seeing her own face in the mirror of another lady exclaimed Who
is this Whatever my friends tell me when they see me now I am
inclined to think proceeds from the partiality of their affection
I am sure that you yourself when you consider more impartially
what you have said will be induced to believe according to
these lines of Du Bellay
Cest chercher Rome en Rome
Et rien de Rome en Rome ne trouver
Tis to seek Rome in Rome to go
And Rome herself at Rome not know
But as we read with pleasure the history of the Siege of Troy
the magnificence of Athens and other splendid cities which
once flourished but are now so entirely destroyed that scarcely
the spot whereon they stood can be traced so you please yourself
with describing these excellences of beauty which are no more
and which will be discoverable only in your writings
If you had taken upon you to contrast Nature and Fortune you
could not have chosen a happier theme upon which to descant
for both have made a trial of their strength on the subject of
your Memoirs What Nature did you had the evidence of your own
eyes to vouch for but what was done by Fortune you know only
from hearsay and hearsay I need not tell you is liable to
be influenced by ignorance or malice and therefore is not
to be depended on You will for that reason I make no doubt
be pleased to receive these Memoirs from the hand which is most
interested in the truth of them
I have been induced to undertake writing my Memoirs the more
from five or six observations which I have had occasion to make
upon your work as you appear to have been misinformed respecting
certain particulars For example in that part where mention is
made of Pau and of my journey in France likewise where you
speak of the late Marechal de Biron of Agen and of the sally
of the Marquis de Camillac from that place
These Memoirs might merit the honourable name of history from the
truths contained in them as I shall prefer truth to embellishment
In fact to embellish my story I have neither leisure nor ability
I shall therefore do no more than give a simple narration of
events They are the labours of my evenings and will come to
you an unformed mass to receive its shape from your hands or
as a chaos on which you have already thrown light Mine is a
history most assuredly worthy to come from a man of honour one
who is a true Frenchman born of illustrious parents brought
up in the Court of the Kings my father and brothers allied in
blood and friendship to the most virtuous and accomplished women
of our times of which society I have had the good fortune to
be the bond of union
I shall begin these Memoirs in the reign of Charles IX and
set out with the first remarkable event of my life which fell
within my remembrance Herein I follow the example of geographical
writers who having described the places within their knowledge
tell you that all beyond them are sandy deserts countries without
inhabitants or seas never navigated Thus I might say that all
prior to the commencement of these Memoirs was the barrenness of
my infancy when we can only be said to vegetate like plants
or live like brutes according to instinct and not as human
creatures guided by reason To those who had the direction of
my earliest years I leave the task of relating the transactions
of my infancy if they find them as worthy of being recorded as
the infantine exploits of Themistocles and Alexanderthe one
exposing himself to be trampled on by the horses of a charioteer
who would not stop them when requested to do so and the other
refusing to run a race unless kings were to enter the contest
against him Amongst such memorable things might be related the
answer I made the King my father a short time before the fatal
accident which deprived France of peace and our family of its
chief glory I was then about four or five years of age when
the King placing me on his knee entered familiarly into chat
with me There were in the same room playing and diverting
themselves the Prince de Joinville since the great and unfortunate
Duc de Guise and the Marquis de Beaupreau son of the Prince
de la RochesurYon who died in his fourteenth year and by
whose death his country lost a youth of most promising talents
Amongst other discourse the King asked which of the two Princes
that were before me I liked best I replied The Marquis The
King said Why so He is not the handsomest The Prince de
Joinville was fair with lightcoloured hair and the Marquis
de Beaupreau brown with dark hair I answered Because he is
the best behaved whilst the Prince is always making mischief
and will be master over everybody
This was a presage of what we have seen happen since when the
whole Court was infected with heresy about the time of the
Conference of Poissy It was with great difficulty that I resisted
and preserved myself from a change of religion at that time
Many ladies and lords belonging to Court strove to convert me to
Huguenotism The Duc dAnjou since King Henri III of France
then in his infancy had been prevailed on to change his religion
and he often snatched my Hours out of my hand and flung them
into the fire giving me Psalm Books and books of Huguenot prayers
insisting on my using them I took the first opportunity to give
them up to my governess Madame de Curton whom God out of his
mercy to me caused to continue steadfast in the Catholic religion
She frequently took me to that pious good man the Cardinal
de Tournon who gave me good advice and strengthened me in a
perseverance in my religion furnishing me with books and chaplets
of beads in the room of those my brother Anjou took from me and
burnt
Many of my brothers most intimate friends had resolved on my
ruin and rated me severely upon my refusal to change saying
it proceeded from a childish obstinacy that if I had the least
understanding and would listen like other discreet persons to
the sermons that were preached I should abjure my uncharitable
bigotry but I was said they as foolish as my governess My
brother Anjou added threats and said the Queen my mother would
give orders that I should be whipped But this he said of his
own head for the Queen my mother did not at that time know of
the errors he had embraced As soon as it came to her knowledge
she took him to task and severely reprimanded his governors
insisting upon their correcting him and instructing him in the
holy and ancient religion of his forefathers from which she
herself never swerved When he used those menaces as I have
before related I was a child seven or eight years old and at
that tender age would reply to him Well get me whipped if
you can I will suffer whipping and even death rather than be
damned
I could furnish you with many other replies of the like kind
which gave proof of the early ripeness of my judgment and my
courage but I shall not trouble myself with such researches
choosing rather to begin these Memoirs at the time when I resided
constantly with the Queen my mother
Immediately after the Conference of Poissy the civil wars commenced
and my brother Alencon and myself on account of pur youth were
sent to Amboise whither all the ladies of the country repaired
to us With them came your aunt Madame de Dampierre who entered
into a firm friendship with me which was never interrupted until
her death broke it off There was likewise your cousin the Duchesse
de Rais who had the good fortune to hear there of the death
of her brute of a husband killed at the battle of Dreux The
husband I mean was the first she had named M dAnnebaut who
was unworthy to have for a wife so accomplished and charming a
woman as your cousin She and I were not then so intimate friends
as we have become since and shall ever remain The reason was
that though older than I she was yet young and young girls
seldom take much notice of children whereas your aunt was of an
age when women admire their innocence and engaging simplicity
I remained at Amboise until the Queen my mother was ready to
set out on her grand progress at which time she sent for me to
come to her Court which I did not quit afterwards
Of this progress I will not undertake to give you a description
being still so young that though the whole is within my
recollection yet the particular passages of it appear to me
but as a dream and are now lost I leave this task to others
of riper years as you were yourself You can well remember the
magnificence that was displayed everywhere particularly at the
baptism of my nephew the Duc de Lorraine at BarleDuc at
the meeting of M and Madame de Savoy in the city of Lyons
the interview at Bayonne betwixt my sister the Queen of Spain
the Queen my mother and King Charles my brother In your account
of this interview you would not forget to make mention of the
noble entertainment given by the Queen my mother on an island
with the grand dances and the form of the salon which seemed
appropriated by nature for such a purpose it being a large meadow
in the middle of the island in the shape of an oval surrounded
on every side by tall spreading trees In this meadow the Queen
my mother had disposed a circle of niches each of them large
enough to contain a table of twelve covers At one end a platform
was raised ascended by four steps formed of turf Here their
Majesties were seated at a table under a lofty canopy The tables
were all served by troops of shepherdesses dressed in cloth of
gold and satin after the fashion of the different provinces of
France These shepherdesses during the passage of the superb
boats from Bayonne to the island were placed in separate bands
in a meadow on each side of the causeway raised with turf and
whilst their Majesties and the company were passing through the
great salon they danced On their passage by water the barges
were followed by other boats having on board vocal and instrumental
musicians habited like Nereids singing and playing the whole
time After landing the shepherdesses I have mentioned before
received the company in separate troops with songs and dances
after the fashion and accompanied by the music of the provinces they
representedthe Poitevins playing on bagpipes the Provencales
on the viol and cymbal the Burgundians and Champagners on the
hautboy bass viol and tambourine in like manner the Bretons
and other provincialists After the collation was served and the
feast at an end a large troop of musicians habited like satyrs
was seen to come out of the opening of a rock well lighted up
whilst nymphs were descending from the top in rich habits who
as they came down formed into a grand dancewhen lo fortune
no longer favouring this brilliant festival a sudden storm of
rain came on and all were glad to get off in the boats and make
for town as fast as they could The confusion in consequence of
this precipitate retreat afforded as much matter to laugh at
the next day as the splendour of the entertainment had excited
admiration In short the festivity of this day was not forgotten
on one account or the other amidst the variety of the like nature
which succeeded it in the course of this progress
LETTER II
At the time my magnanimous brother Charles reigned over France and
some few years after our return from the grand progress mentioned in
my last letter the Huguenots having renewed the war a gentleman
despatched from my brother Anjou afterwards Henri III of France
came to Paris to inform the King and the Queen my mother that
the Huguenot army was reduced to such an extremity that he hoped
in a few days to force them to give him battle He added his
earnest wish for the honour of seeing them at Tours before that
happened so that in case Fortune envying him the glory he
had already achieved at so early an age should on the so much
lookedfor day after the good service he had done his religion
and his King crown the victory with his death he might not have
cause to regret leaving this world without the satisfaction of
receiving their approbation of his conduct from their own mouthsa
satisfaction which would be more valuable in his opinion than
the trophies he had gained by his two former victories
I leave to your own imagination to suggest to you the impression
which such a message from a dearly beloved son made on the mind
of a mother who doted on all her children and was always ready to
sacrifice her own repose nay even her life for their happiness
She resolved immediately to set off and take the King with her
She had besides myself her usual small company of female
attendants together with Mesdames de Rais and de Sauves She
flew on the wings of maternal affection and reached Tours in
three days and a half A journey from Paris made with such
precipitation was not unattended with accidents and some
inconveniences of a nature to occasion much mirth and laughter
The poor Cardinal de Bourbon who never quitted her and whose
temper of mind strength of body and habits of life were ill
suited to encounter privations and hardships suffered greatly
from this rapid journey
We found my brother Anjou at PlessislesTours with the principal
officers of his army who were the flower of the princes and
nobles of France In their presence he delivered a harangue to
the King giving a detail of his conduct in the execution of his
charge beginning from the time he left the Court His discourse
was framed with so much eloquence and spoken so gracefully that
it was admired by all present It appeared matter of astonishment
that a youth of sixteen should reason with all the gravity and
powers of an orator of ripe years The comeliness of his person
which at all times pleads powerfully in favour of a speaker
was in him set off by the laurels obtained in two victories In
short it was difficult to say which most contributed to make
him the admiration of all his hearers
It is equally as impossible for me to describe in words the feelings
of my mother on this occasion who loved him above all her children
as it was for the painter to represent on canvas the grief of
Iphigenias father Such an overflow of joy would have been
discoverable in the looks and actions of any other woman but
she had her passions so much under the control of prudence and
discretion that there was nothing to be perceived in her countenance
or gathered from her words of what she felt inwardly in her mind
She was indeed a perfect mistress of herself and regulated
her discourse and her actions by the rules of wisdom and sound
policy showing that a person of discretion does upon all occasions
only what is proper to be done She did not amuse herself on
this occasion with listening to the praises which issued from
every mouth and sanction them with her own approbation but
selecting the chief points in the speech relative to the future
conduct of the war she laid them before the Princes and great
lords to be deliberated upon in order to settle a plan of
operations
To arrange such a plan a delay of some days was requisite During
this interval the Queen my mother walking in the park with some
of the Princes my brother Anjou begged me to take a turn or two
with him in a retired walk He then addressed me in the following
words Dear sister the nearness of blood as well as our having
been brought up together naturally as they ought attach us
to each other You must already have discovered the partiality
I have had for you above my brothers and I think that I have
perceived the same in you for me We have been hitherto led to
this by nature without deriving any other advantage from it
than the sole pleasure of conversing together So far might be
well enough for our childhood but now we are no longer children
You know the high situation in which by the favour of God and
our good mother the Queen I am here placed You may be assured
that as you are the person in the world whom I love and esteem
the most you will always be a partaker of my advancement I know
you are not wanting in wit and discretion and I am sensible
you have it in your power to do me service with the Queen our
mother and preserve me in my present employments It is a great
point obtained for me always to stand well in her favour I
am fearful that my absence may be prejudicial to that purpose
and I must necessarily be at a distance from Court Whilst I am
away the King my brother is with her and has it in his power
to insinuate himself into her good graces This I fear in the
end may be of disservice to me The King my brother is growing
older every day He does not want for courage and though he now
diverts himself with hunting he may grow ambitious and choose
rather to chase men than beasts in such a case I must resign to
him my commission as his lieutenant This would prove the greatest
mortification that could happen to me and I would even prefer death
to it Under such an apprehension I have considered of the means
of prevention and see none so feasible as having a confidential
person about the Queen my mother who shall always be ready to
