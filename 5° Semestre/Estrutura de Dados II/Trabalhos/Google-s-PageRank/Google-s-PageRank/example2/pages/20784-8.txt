EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT
of the
BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY
By J W POWELL Director
INTRODUCTION
The prosecution of research among the North American Indians as
directed by act of Congress was continued during the fiscal year
188687
The general plan upon which the work has been prosecuted has been
explained in former reports and has not been changed After certain
lines of investigation had been decided upon they were confided to
persons trained in their pursuit with the intention that the results of
their labors when completed or well advanced should be presented from
time to time in the publications of the Bureau provided for by law
A brief statement of the work upon which each one of the special
students was actively engaged during the fiscal year is furnished below
but this statement does not embrace all the studies undertaken or
services rendered by them since particular lines of research have been
suspended in this as in former years in order to prosecute unto
substantial completeness work regarded as of paramount importance From
this cause delays have been occasioned in the completion of several
treatises and monographs already partly in type which otherwise would
have been published
Invitation is renewed for the assistance of explorers writers and
students who are not and may not desire to be officially connected with
the Bureau Their contributions whether in the shape of suggestions or
of extended communications will be gratefully acknowledged and will
always receive proper credit if published either in the series of
reports or in monographs or bulletins as the liberality of Congress may
in future allow
