PREFACE
Wishing to make a continued effort in an art which though almost
in secret has been adored and assiduously cultivated from earliest
infancy it was my intention to have chosen some incident from Pagan
history as the foundation of my contemplated poem But looking over
the Jewish annals I was induced to select for my purpose one of
their wellknown stories which besides its extreme beauty seemed to
open an extensive field for the imagination which might therein avail
itself not only of important and elevated truths but pleasing and
popular superstitions
Having finished one Canto I left the United States for the West
Indies in the hope of being able to sail thence for Great Britain
where I might submit what I had done to the candour of some able
writer publish it if thought expedient and obtain advice and
materials for the improvement and prosecution of my work But as
events have transpired to frustrate that intention I have endeavored
to make it as perfect as with the means I have access to is
possible
It is now far beneath what might have been done under the
influence of more decided hopes and more auspicious circumstances
Yet as it is I am induced to place it before the public with that
anxiety which naturally attends the doubtful accomplishment of any
favourite object on the principle that no artist can make the same
improvement or labour with so much pleasure to himself in private
as when comparing his efforts with those of others and listening to
the opinions of critics and the remarks of connoisseurs The beauty
though she may view herself in her mirror from the ringlets of her
hair to the sole of her slipper and appear most lovely to her own
gaze can never be certain of her power to please until the suffrage
of society confirm the opinion formed in seclusion and Quest ce
que la beaute selle ne touche pas
Literary employments are necessary to the happiness and almost to
the vitality of those who pursue them with much ardour and though
the votaries of the muses are too often debased by faults yet
abstractedly considered a taste for any art if well directed must
seem a preservative not only against melancholy but even against
misery and vice
Genius whatever its bent supposes a refined and delicate moral
sense and though sometimes perverted by sophistry or circumstance
and sometimes failing through weakness can always at least
comprehend and feel the grandeur of honour and the beauty of virtue
As to the faults of those to whom the world allows the possession of
genius there are perhaps good grounds for the belief that they
have actually fewer than those employed about ordinary affairs but
the last are easily concealed and the first carefully dragged to
light
The miseries too sometimes attendant to persons of distinguished
literary attainments are often held forth as a subject of warn and
scare but Cervantes and Camoens would both have been cast into
prison even though unable to read or write and Savage though a
mechanic or scrivener would probably have possessed the same
failings and consequently have fallen into the same or a greater
degree of poverty and suffering Alas how many in the flower of
youth and strength perish in the loathsome dungeons of this island
and when dead are refused a decent grave who in many instances
were their histories traced by an able pen would be wept by half the
civilized world
Although I can boast nothing but an extreme and unquenchable love
for the art to which my humble aspirations are confined my lyre has
been a solace when every thing else has failed soothing when
agitated and when at peace furnishing that exercise and excitement
without which the mind becomes sick and all her faculties retrograde
when they ought to be advancing Men when they feel that nature has
kindled in their bosoms a flame which must incessantly be fed can
cultivate eloquence and exert it in aid of the unfortunate before
the judgment seats of their country or endeavour to lure to the
skies such as enter the temples of their god but woman alike
subject to trials and vicissitudes and endowed with the same wishes
for the observation there is no sex to soul is certainly not
untrue condemned perhaps to a succession of arduous though minute
duties in which oftentimes there is nothing to charm and little to
distract unless she be allowed the exercise of her pen must fall
into melancholy and despair and perish to use the language of Mad
de Stael consumed by her own energies
Thus do we endeavour to excuse any inordinate or extreme attachment
by labouring to show in their highest colours the merits of its
object
Zophiel may or may not be called entirely a creature of imagination
as comports with the faith of the reader he is not however endowed
with a single miraculous attribute for which the general belief of
ages even among christians may not be produced as authority
The stanza in which his story is told though less complicate and
beautiful than the Spencerian is equally ancient and favorable to a
pensive melody is also susceptible of much variety
The marginal notes will be useless to such as have read much
San Patricio Island of Cuba March 30 1825
INVOCATION
Thou with the dark blue eye upturned to heaven
And cheek now pale now warm with radiant glow
Daughter of Godmost dear
Come with thy quivering tear
And tresses wild and robes of loosened flow
To thy lone votaress let one look be given
Come Poesy nor like some justformed maid
With heart as yet unswoln by bliss or woe
But of such age be seen
As Egypts glowing queen
When her brave Roman learned to love her so
That death and loss of fame were by a smile repaid
Or as thy Sappho when too fierce assailed
By stern ingratitude her tender breast
Her love by scorn repaid
Her friendship true betrayed
Sick of the guileful earth she sank for rest
In the cold waves embrace while Grecian muse bewailed
Be to my mortal eye like some fair dame
Ripe but untouched by time whose frequent blush
Plays oer her cheek of truth
As soft as earliest youth
While thoughts exalted to her mild eye rush
And the expanded soul tells twas from heaven it came
Daughter of lifes first cause who when he saw
The ills that unborn innocents must bear
When doomed to come to earth
Bethoughtand gave thee birth
To charm the poison from affliction there
And from his source eternal bade thee draw
He gave thee power inferior to his own
But in control oer matter Mid the crash
Of earthquake war and storm
Is seen thy radiant form
Thou comst at midnight on the lightnings flash
And opest to those thou lovst new scenes and worlds unknown
And still as wild barbarians fiercely break
The graceful column and the marble dome
Where arts too long have lain
Debased at pleasures fain
And bleeding justice called on wrath to come
Mid ruins heaped around thou bidst thy votarists wake
Methinks I see thee on the broken shrine
Of some falln templewhere the grass waves high
With many a flowret wild
While some lone pensive child
Looks on the sculpture with a wondering eye
Whose kindling fires betray that he is chosen thine FN1
FN1  Genius perhaps has often nay generally been awakened and
the whole future bent of the mind thus strongly operated upon
determined by some circumstance trivial as this
Or on some beetling cliffwhere the mad waves
Rush echoing thro the higharched caves below
I view some lovereft fair
Whose sighing warms the air
Gaze anxious on the ocean as it raves
And call on theealone of power to sooth her woe
Friend of the wretched smoother of the couch
Of pining hope thy pitying form I know
Where thro the wakeful night
By a dim tapers light
Lies a pale youth upon his pallet low
Whose wan and woeworn charms rekindle at thy touch
Friendlessoppressed by fatethe restless fires
Of his thralled soul prey on his beauteous frame
Till strengthened by thine aid
He shapes some kindred maid
Pours forth in song the life consuming flame
And for awhile forgets his sufferings and desires
Scorner of thoughtless grandeur thou hast chose
Thy bestbeloved from ruddy Natures breast
The grotto dark and rude
The forest solitude
The craggy mount by blushing clouds carest
Have altars where thy light etherial glows FN2
FN2  Every nation however rude has as it has been justly
observed a taste for poetry This art after all that has and can be
said for and against it is the language of nature and among the
relics of the most polished and learned nations little has survived
except such as simply depicts those natural feelings and images which
have ever existed and ever must continue Most of the great poets
have been individuals of humble condition rising from the mass of the
people by that natural principle which causes the most etherial
particles to rise and the denser to sink to the earth But as Byron
exquisitely says in one of the most wonderfully beautiful pages he
ever composed
Many are poets who have never penned
Their inspirations and perchance the best
They felt they loved and died but would not lend
Their thoughts to meaner beings they comprest
The god within them and rejoined the stars
Unlaureld upon earth
In the place where I now write amid several hundred Africans of
different ages and nations the most debased of any on the face of
the earth I have been enabled to observe even in this last link of
the chain of humanity the strong natural love for music and poetry
Any little incident which occurs on the estate where they toil and
which the greater part of them are never suffered to leave is
immediately made the subject of a rude song which they in their
broken Spanish sing to their companions and thereby relieve a
little the monotony of their lives
I have observed these poor creatures under various circumstances
and though generally extremely brutal have in some instances
heard touches of sentiment from them when under the influence of
grief equal to any which have flowed from the pen of Rousseau
Thy sovereign priest by earths vile sons was driven
To make the cold unconscious earth his bed FN3
The damp cave mocked his sighs
But from his sightless eyes
Wrung forth by wrongs the anguished drops he shed
Fell each as an appeal to summon thee from heaven
Thou soughtst him in his desolation placed
On thy warm bosom his unpillowed head
Bade him for visions live
More bright than worlds can give
Oer his pale lips thy soul infusive shed
That left his dust adored where kings decay untraced
FN3  On the banks of the Meles was shown the spot where
Critheis the mother of Homer brought him into the world and the
cavern to which he retired to compose his immortal verses A monument
erected to his memory and inscribed with his name stood in the middle
of the cityit was adorned with spacious porticos under which the
citizens assembled
Source of deep feelingof surpassing love
Creative powertis thou hast peopled heaven
Since man from dust arose
His birth the cherub owes FN4
To theeby thee his rapturous harp was given
And white wings tippd with gold that cool the domes above
FN4  The Indians says M de Voltaire from whom every species of
theology is derived invented the angels and represented them in
their ancient book the Shasta as immortal creatures participating
in the divinity of their creator against whom a great number
revolted in heaven Les Parsis ignicoles qui subsistent encore ont
communique a lauteur de la religion des anciens Perses les noms des
anges que les premiers Perses reconnaissaient On en trouve centdix
neuf parmi desquels ne sont ni Raphael ni Gabriel que les Perses
nadopterent que longtems apres Ces mots sont Chaldeens ils ne
furent connus des Juifs que dans leur captivite
Husher of secret sighsfrom childhoods hour
The slave of Fate Ive knelt before thy throne
To thy loved courts have sped
Wheneer my heart has bled
And every ray of bliss that heart has known
Has reached it thro thy griefdispelling power
Fain thro my native solitudes Id roam
Bathe my rude harp in my bright native streams
Twine it with flowers that bloom
But for the deserts gloom
Or for the long and jetty hair that gleams
Oer the darkbosomed maid that makes the wild her home FN5
FN5  This invocation when composed was intended to precede a
series of poems entitled Occidental Eclogues which work the writer
has never found opportunity to finish
I sing not for the crowd or low or high
A pensive wanderer on lifes thorny heath
Earths pageants for my view
Have nought I love but few
And few who chance to hear thy trembling breath
My lyre for her who wakes thee have a sigh FN6
FN6  It may not be improper to observe that these stanzas were
composed during a period of misfortune and dejection
Forsake me not none ever loved thee more
Fair queen Ill meet woes fearfulest frownand smile
If mid the scene severe
Thoult drop on me one tear
And let thy flitting form sometimes beguile
The present of its illsIll scorn them and adore
Then warm the form relentless fate would chill
Dark lours my nightOh give me one embrace
If every pain I bear
Befit me for thy care
Come sorrowscorndesertionI can chase
Despair fell watching for her victim still
ZOPHIEL
CANTO I
I
The time has beenthis holiest records say
In punishment for crimes of mortal birth
When spirits banished from the realms of day
Wandered malignant oer the nighted earth1
And from the cold and marble lips declared
Of some blindworshippedearthcreated god
Their deep deceits which trusting monarchs snared
Filling the air with moans with gore the sod FN7
Yet angels doffed their robes in radiance dyed
And for a while the joys of heaven delayed
To watch benign by some just mortals side
Or meet th aspiring love of some high gifted maid FN8
Blest were those dayscan these dull ages boast
Aught to compare tho now no more beguile
Chaind in their darkling depths th infernal host
Who would not brave a fiend to share an angels smile
FN7  The god who conducted the Hebrews sent a malignant spirit to
speak from the mouth of the prophets in order to deceive king Achab
FN8  It is useless to note this stanza as two wellknown poems
have lately been founded on the same passage of the Pentateuch to
which it alludes
II
Twas then there lived a captive Hebrew pair
In woe th embraces of their youth had past
And blest their paler years one daughterfair
She flourished like a lonely rose the last
And loveliest of her line The tear of joy
The early love of songthe sigh that broke
From her young lipthe bestbeloved employ
What womanhood disclosed in infancy bespoke
A child of passiontenderest and best
Of all that heart has inly loved and felt
Adorned the fair enclosure of her breast
Where passion is not found no virtue ever dwelt
Yet not perverted would my words imply
The impulse given by Heavens great Artizan
Alike to man and wormmere spring whereby
The distant wheels of life while time endures roll on
But the collective ministry that fill
About the soul their allimportant place
That feed her firesempower her fainting will
And write the god on feeble mortals face
III
Yet anger or revenge envy or hate
The damsel knew not when her bosom burned
And injury darkened the decrees of fate
She had more pitious wept to see that pain returned
Or if perchance tho formed most just and pure
Amid their virtues wild luxuriance hid
Such germ all mortal bosoms must immure
Which sometimes show their poisonous heads unbid
If haply such the lovely Hebrew finds
Self knowledge wept th abasing truth to know
And innate pride that queen of noble minds
Crushed them indignant ere a bud could grow
IV
And suchevn now in earliest youth are seen
But would they live with armour more deform
Their loveoerflowing breasts must learn to screen
The bird that sweetest sings can least endure the storm
V
And yet despite of all the gushing tear
The melting tonethe darting heartstreamproved
The soul that in them spoke could spurn at fear
Of death or danger and had those she loved
Required it at their need she could have stood
Unmoved as some fairsculptured statue while
The dome that guards it earths convulsions rude
Are shiveringmeeting ruin with a smile
VI
And this at intervals in language bright
Told her blue eyes tho oft the tender lid
Like lilly drooping languidly and white
And tremblingall save love and lustre hid
Then as young christian bard had sung they seemed
Like some Madonna in his soulso sainted
But opening in their energythey beamed
As tasteful pagans their Minerva painted
While oer her graceful shoulders milky swell
Like those full oft on little children seen
Almost to earth her silken ringlets fell
Nor owned Pactolus sands more golden sheen
VII
And now full near the hour unwished for drew
When fond Sephora hoped to see her wed
And for twould else expire impatient grew
To renovate her race from beauteous Eglas bed
VIII
None of their kindred lived to claim her hand
But strangeryouths had asked her of her sire
With gifts and promise fair he could withstand
All save her tears and harkening her desire
Still left her free but soon her mother drew
From her a vow that when the twentieth year
Its full fair finish oer her beauty threw
If what her fancy fed on came not near
She would entreat no more but to the voice
Of her lightgiver hearken and her life
And loveall yielding to that kindly choice
Would hush each idle wish and learn to be a wife
IX
Now oft it happd when morning task was done
And for the virgins of her household made
And lotted each her toil while yet the sun
Was young fair Egla to a woody shade
Loved to retreat there in the fainting hour
Of sultry noon the burning sunbeam fell
Like a warm twilight so bereft of power
It gained an entrance thro the leafy bower
That scarcely shrank the tender lilly bell
Tranquil and lone in such a light to be
How sweet to sense and soulthe form recline
Forgets it ere felt pain and reverie
Sweet mother of the muses heart and soul are thine FN9
FN9  Every one talks and reads of groves but it is impossible
for those who never felt it to conceive the effect of such a
situation in a warm climate In this island the woods which are
naturally so interwoven with vines as to be impervious to a human
being are in some places cleared and converted into nurseries for
the young coffeetrees which remain sheltered from the sun and wind
till sufficiently grown to transplant To enter one of these
semilleros as they are here called at noon day produces an
effect like that anciently ascribed to the waters of Lethe After
sitting down upon the trunk of a fallen cedar or palmtree and
breathing for a moment the freshness of the air and the odour of the
passion flower which is one of the most abundant and certainly the
most beautiful of the climate the noise of the trees which are
continually kept in motion by the trade winds the fluttering and
various notes though not musical of the birds the loftiness of the
green canopy for the trunks of the trees are bare to a great height
and seem like pillars supporting the thick mass of leaves above and
the rich mellow light which the intense rays of the sun thus
impeded produce have altogether such an effect that one
involuntarily forgets every thing but the present and it requires a
strong effort to rise and leave the place
X
This calm recess on summer day she sought
And sat to tune her lute but all night long
Quiet had from her pillow flown and thought
Feverish and tired sent for th unseemly throng
Of boding images She scarce could woo
One song reluctant ere advancing quick
Thro the fresh leaves Sephoras form she knew
And duteous rose to meet but fainting sick
Her heart sank tremulously in her why
Sought out at such an hour it half divined
And seated now beside with downcast eye
And fevered pulse she met the pressure kind
And warmly given while thus the matron fair
Nor yet much marrd by time with soothing words
Solicitous and gently serious air
The purpose why she hither came preferrd
XI
Egla my hopes thou knowesttho exprest
But rare lest they should pain theeI have dealt
Not rudely towards thee tender and supprest
The wish of all my heart has most vehement felt
Know I have marked that when the reason why
Thou still wouldst live in virgin state thy sire
Has prest thee to impart quick in thine eye
Semblance of hope has playedfain to transpire
Words seemd to seek thy lip but the bright rush
Of heartblood eloquent alone would tell
In the warm language of a rebel blush
What thy less treacherous tongue has guarded well
XII
Dost waste so oft alonethe cheerful day
Or haply rather bath some pagan youth
She with quick burstwhateer has happd Ill say
Doubt thou my wisdom but regard my truth
XIII
Long time ago while yet a twelve years child
These shrubs and vines new planted near this spot
I sat me tired with pleasant toil and whiled
Away the time with many a wishful thought
Of desolate Judea Every scene
Which thou so oft while sitting on thy knee
Wouldst sing of weeping thro my mind has been
Successive when from yon old mossy tree
I heard a pitious moan Wondering I went
And found a wretched man worn and opprest
He seemed with toil and years and whispering faint
He said Oh little maiden sore distrest
I sink for very want Give me I pray
A drop of water and a cake I die
Of thirst and hunger yet my sorrowing way
May tread once more if thou my needs supply
XIV
A long time missing from thy fondling arms
It chanced that day thoudst sent me in the shade
New bread a cake of figs and wine of palms FN10
Mingled with water sweet with honey made
These did I bringraised as I could his head
Held to his lip the cup and while he quaffed
Upon my garment wiped the tears that sped
Adown his silvery beard and mingled with the draft
FN10  The palm is a very common plant in this country
Assyria and generally fruitful this they cultivate like figtrees
and it produces them bread wine and honey See Beloes notes to his
translation of Herodotus Mr Gibbon adds that the diligent natives
celebrated either in verse or prose three hundred and sixty uses to
which the trunk the branches the leaves the juice and the fruit of
this plant were applied Nothing can be more curious and interesting
than the natural history of the palm tree
XV
When gaining sudden strength he raised his hand
And in this guise did bless me Mayst thou be
A crown to him who weds theeIn a land
Far distant bides a captive Hearken me
And choose thee now a bridegroom meet to day
Oer broad Euphrates steepest banks a child
Fled from his youthful nurses arms in play
Elate he bent him oer the brink and smiled
To see their fears who followed himbut who
The keen wild anguish of that scene can tell
He bend oer the brink and in their view
But ah too far beyond their aidhe fell
XVI
They wailedthe long torn ringlets of their hair FN11
Freighted the pitying gale deep rolled the stream
And swallowed the fair child no succour there
They womenwhither lookwho to redeem
What the fierce waves were preying onwhen lo
Approached a stranger boy Aside he flung
As darted thought his quiver and his bow
And parted by his limbs the sparkling billows sung
FN11  The women I believe among all nations of antiquity were
accustomed to express violent grief by tearing their hair This must
have been a great and affecting sacrifice to the object bemoaned as
they considered it a part of themselves and absolutely essential to
their beauty Fine hair has been a subject of commendation among all
people and particularly the ancients Cyrus when he went to visit
his uncle Astyages found him with his eyelashes coloured and
decorated with false locks the first Caesar obtained permission to
