the men who will It is surely as interesting that presently some
founder of the World Republic some obstinate opponent of militarism or
legalism or the man who will first release atomic energy for human use
will walk along the Via Sacra as that Cicero or Giordano Bruno or
Shelley have walked there in the past To the prophetic mind all history
is and will continue to be a prelude The prophetic type will
steadfastly refuse to see the world as a museum it will insist that
here is a stage set for a drama that perpetually begins
Now this forecasting disposition has led the writer not only to publish
a book of deliberate prophesying called Anticipations but almost
without premeditation to scatter a number of more or less obvious
prophecies through his other books From first to last he has been
writing for twenty years so that it is possible to check a certain
proportion of these anticipations by the things that have happened Some
of these shots have hit remarkably close to the bullseye of reality
there are a number of inners and outers and some clean misses Much
that he wrote about in anticipation is now established commonplace In
1894 there were still plenty of sceptics of the possibility either of
automobiles or aeroplanes it was not until 1898 that Mr SP Langley
of the Smithsonian Institute could send the writer a photograph of a
heavierthanair flying machine actually in the air There were articles
in the monthly magazines of those days proving that flying was
impossible
One of the writers luckiest shots was a description in Anticipations
in 1900 of trench warfare and of a deadlock almost exactly upon the
lines of the situation after the battle of the Marne And he was
fortunate in the same work in his estimate of the limitations of
submarines He anticipated Sir Percy Scott by a year in his doubts of
the decisive value of great battleships see An Englishman Looks at
the World and he was sound in denying the decadence of France in
doubting before the RussoJapanese struggle the greatness of the power
of Russia which was still in those days a British bogey in making
Belgium the battleground in a coming struggle between the midEuropean
Powers and the rest of Europe and he believes in foretelling a
renascent Poland Long before Europe was familiar with the engaging
personality of the German Crown Prince he represented great airships
sailing over England which country had been too unenterprising to make
any under the command of a singularly anticipatory Prince Karl and in
The World Set Free the last disturber of the peace is a certain
Balkan Fox
In saying however here and there that before such a year soandso
will happen or that soandso will not occur for the next twenty
years he was generally pretty widely wrong most of his time estimates
are too short he foretold for example a special motor track apart
from the high road between London and Brighton before 1910 which is
still a dream but he doubted if effective military aviation or aerial
fighting would be possible before 1950 which is a miss on the other
side He will draw a modest veil over certain still wider misses that
the idle may find for themselves in his books he prefers to count the
hits and leave the reckoning of the misses to those who will find a
pleasure in it
Of course these prophecies of the writers were made upon a basis of
very generalised knowledge What can be done by a really sustained
research into a particular questionespecially if it is a question
essentially mechanicalis shown by the work of a Frenchman all too
neglected by the trumpet of fameClement Ader M Ader was probably the
first man to get a mechanism up into the air for something more than a
leap His Eole as General Mensier testifies prolonged a jump as far
as fifty metres as early as 1890 In 1897 his Avion fairly flew This
is a year ahead of the date of my earliest photograph of SP Langleys
aeropile in midair This however is beside our present mark The
fact of interest here is that in 1908 when flying was still almost
incredible M Ader published his Aviation Militaire Well that was
eight years ago and men have been fighting in the air now for a year
and there is still nothing being done that M Ader did not see and
which we if we had had the wisdom to attend to him might not have been
prepared for There is much that he foretells which is still awaiting
its inevitable fulfilment So clearly can men of adequate knowledge and
sound reasoning power see into the years ahead in all such matters of
material development
But it is not with the development of mechanical inventions that the
writer now proposes to treat In this book he intends to hazard certain
forecasts about the trend of events in the next decade or so Mechanical
novelties will probably play a very small part in that coming history
This worldwide war means a general arrest of invention and enterprise
except in the direction of the war business Ability is concentrated
upon that the types of ability that are not applicable to warfare are
neglected there is a vast destruction of capital and a waste of the
savings that are needed to finance new experiments Moreover we are
killing off many of our brightest young men
It is fairly safe to assume that there will be very little new furniture
on the stage of the world for some considerable time that if there is
much difference in the roads and railways and shipping it will be for
the worse that architecture domestic equipment and so on will be
fortunate if in 1924 they stand where they did in the spring of 1914 In
the trenches of France and Flanders and on the battlefields of Russia
the Germans have been spending and making the world spend the comfort
the luxury and the progress of the next quartercentury There is no
accounting for tastes But the result is that while it was possible
for the writer in 1900 to write Anticipations of the Reaction of
Mechanical Progress upon Human Life and Thought in 1916 his
anticipations must belong to quite another system of consequences
The broad material facts before us are plain enough It is the mental
facts that have to be unravelled It isnt now a question of What
thingwhat facultywhat added power will come to hand and how will it
affect our ways of living It is a question of How are people going to
take these obvious thingswaste of the worlds resources arrest of
material progress the killing of a large moiety of the males in nearly
every European country and universal loss and unhappiness We are
going to deal with realities here at once more intimate and less
accessible than the effects of mechanism
As a preliminary reconnaissance as it were over the region of problems
we have to attack let us consider the difficulties of a single
question which is also a vital and central question in this forecast
We shall not attempt a full answer here because too many of the factors
must remain unexamined later perhaps we may be in a better position
to do so This question is the probability of the establishment of a
long world peace
At the outset of the war there was a very widely felt hope among the
intellectuals of the world that this war might clear up most of the
outstanding international problems and prove the last war The writer
looking across the gulf of experience that separates us from 1914
recalls two pamphlets whose very titles are eloquent of this
feelingThe War that will End War and The Peace of the World Was
the hope expressed in those phrases a dream Is it already proven a
dream Or can we read between the lines of the war news diplomatic
disputations threats and accusations political wranglings and stories
of hardship and cruelty that now fill our papers anything that still
justifies a hope that these bitter years of world sorrow are the
darkness before the dawn of a better day for mankind Let us handle this
problem for a preliminary examination
What is really being examined here is the power of human reason to
prevail over passionand certain other restraining and qualifying
forces There can be little doubt that if one could canvass all mankind
and ask them whether they would rather have no war any more the
overwhelming mass of them would elect for universal peace If it were
war of the modern mechanical type that was in question with air raids
high explosives poison gas and submarines there could be no doubt at
all about the response Give peace in our time O Lord is more than
ever the common prayer of Christendom and the very war makers claim to
be peace makers the German Emperor has never faltered in his assertion
that he encouraged Austria to send an impossible ultimatum to Serbia
and invaded Belgium because Germany was being attacked The KruppKaiser
Empire he assures us is no eagle but a doubleheaded lamb resisting
the shearers and butchers The apologists for war are in a hopeless
minority a certain number of German Prussians who think war good for
the soul and the dear ladies of the London Morning Post who think war
so good for the manners of the working classes are rare discordant
voices in the general chorus against war If a mere unsupported and
uncoordinated will for peace could realise itself there would be peace
and an enduring peace tomorrow But as a matter of fact there is no
peace coming tomorrow and no clear prospect yet of an enduring
universal peace at the end of this war
Now what are the obstructions and what are the antagonisms to the
exploitation of this worldwide disgust with war and the worldwide
desire for peace so as to establish a world peace
Let us take them in order and it will speedily become apparent that we
are dealing here with a subtle quantitative problem in psychology a
constant weighing of whether this force or that force is the stronger
We are dealing with influences so subtle that the accidents of some
striking dramatic occurrence for example may turn them this way or
that We are dealing with the human willand thereby comes a snare for
the feet of the wouldbe impartial prophet To foretell the future is to
modify the future It is hard for any prophet not to break into
exhortation after the fashion of the prophets of Israel
The first difficulty in the way of establishing a world peace is that it
is nobodys business in particular Nearly all of us want a world
peacein an amateurish sort of way But there is no specific person or
persons to whom one can look for the initiatives The world is a
supersaturated solution of the willforpeace and there is nothing for
it to crystallise upon There is no one in all the world who is
responsible for the understanding and overcoming of the difficulties
involved There are many more people and there is much more
intelligence concentrated upon the manufacture of cigarettes or
hairpins than upon the establishment of a permanent world peace There
are a few special secretaries employed by philanthropic Americans and
that is about all There has been no provision made even for the
emoluments of these gentlemen when universal peace is attained
presumably they would lose their jobs
Nearly everybody wants peace nearly everybody would be glad to wave a
white flag with a dove on it nowprovided no unfair use was made of
such a demonstration by the enemybut there is practically nobody
thinking out the arrangements needed and nobody making nearly as much
propaganda for the instruction of the world in the things needful as is
made in selling any popular make of automobile We have all our
particular businesses to attend to And things are not got by just
wanting them things are got by getting them and rejecting whatever
precludes our getting them
That is the first great difficulty the formal Peace Movement is quite
amateurish
It is so amateurish that the bulk of people do not even realise the very
first implication of the peace of the world It has not succeeded in
bringing this home to them
If there is to be a permanent peace of the world it is clear that
there must be some permanent means of settling disputes between Powers
and nations that would otherwise be at war That means that there must
be some head power some point of reference a supreme court of some
kind a universally recognised executive over and above the separate
Governments of the world that exist today That does not mean that
those Governments Have to disappear that nationality has to be given
up or anything so drastic as that But it does mean that all those
Governments have to surrender almost as much of their sovereignty as the
constituent sovereign States which make up the United States of America
have surrendered to the Federal Government if their unification is to
be anything more than a formality they will have to delegate a control
of their interState relations to an extent for which few minds are
prepared at present
It is really quite idle to dream of a warless world in which States are
still absolutely free to annoy one another with tariffs with the
blocking and squeezing of trade routes with the illtreatment of
immigrants and travelling strangers and between which there is no means
of settling boundary disputes Moreover as between the united States of
the world and the United States of America there is this further
complication of the world position that almost all the great States of
Europe are in possession firstly of highly developed territories of
alien language and race such as Egypt and secondly of barbaric and
lessdeveloped territories such as Nigeria or Madagascar There will be
nothing stable about a world settlement that does not destroy in these
possessions the national preference of the countries that own them and
that does not prepare for the immediate or eventual accession of these
subject peoples to State rank Most certainly however thousands of
intelligent people in those great European countries who believe
themselves ardent for a world peace will be staggered at any proposal to
place any part of our Empire under a world administration on the
footing of a United States territory Until they cease to be staggered
by anything of the sort their aspirations for a permanent peace will
remain disconnected from the main current of their lives And that
current will flow sluggishly or rapidly towards war For essentially
these possessions are like tariffs like the strategic occupation of
neutral countries or secret treaties they are forms of the conflict
between nations to oust and prevail over other nations
Going on with such things and yet deprecating war is really not an
attempt to abolish conflict it is an attempt to retain conflict and
limit its intensity it is like trying to play hockey on the
understanding that the ball shall never travel faster than eight miles
an hour
Now it not only stands in our way to a permanent peace of the world that
the great mass of men are not prepared for even the most obvious
implications of such an idea but there is also a second invincible
difficultythat there is nowhere in the world anybody any type of men
any organisation any idea any nucleus or germ that could possibly
develop into the necessary overGovernment We are asking for something
out of the air out of nothingness that will necessarily array against
itself the resistance of all those who are in control or interested in
the control of the affairs of sovereign States of the world as they are
at present the resistance of a gigantic network of Government
organisations interests privileges assumptions
Against this a headless vague aspiration however universal is likely
to prove quite ineffective Of course it is possible to suggest that
the Hague Tribunal is conceivably the germ of such an overriding
direction and supreme court as the peace of the world demands but in
reality the Hague Tribunal is a mere legal automatic machine It does
nothing unless you set it in motion It has no initiative It does not
even protest against the most obvious outrages upon that phantom of a
worldconscienceinternational law
Pacificists in their search for some definite startingpoint about
which the immense predisposition for peace may crystallise have
suggested the Pope and various religious organisations as a possible
basis for the organisation of peace But there would be no appeal from
such a beginning to the nonChristian majority of mankind and the
suggestion in itself indicates a profound ignorance of the nature of the
Christian churches With the exception of the Quakers and a few Russian
sects no Christian sect or church has ever repudiated war most have
gone out of the way to sanction it and bless it
It is altogether too rashly assumed by people whose sentimentality
outruns their knowledge that Christianity is essentially an attempt to
carry out the personal teachings of Christ It is nothing of the sort
and no church authority will support that idea Christianitymore
particularly after the ascendancy of the Trinitarian doctrine was
establishedwas and is a theological religion it is the religion that
triumphed over Arianism Manichseism Gnosticism and the like it is
based not on Christ but on its creeds Christ indeed is not even its
symbol on the contrary the chosen symbol of Christianity is the cross
to which Christ was nailed and on which He died It was very largely a
religion of the legions It was the warrior Theodosius who more than
any single other man imposed it upon Europe
There is no reason therefore either in precedent or profession for
expecting any plain lead from the churches in this tremendous task of
organising and making effective the widespread desire of the world for
peace And even were this the case it is doubtful if we should find in
the divines and dignitaries of the Vatican of the Russian and British
official churches or of any other of the multitudinous Christian sects
the power and energy the knowledge and ability or even the goodwill
needed to negotiate so vast a thing as the creation of a world
authority
One other possible startingpoint has been suggested It is no great
feat for a naive imagination to suppose the President of the Swiss
Confederation or the President of the United Statesfor each of these
two systems is an exemplary and encouraging instance of the possibility
of the pacific synthesis of independent Statestaking a propagandist
course and proposing extensions of their own systems to the suffering
belligerents
But nothing of the sort occurs And when you come to look into the
circumstances of these two Presidents you will discover that neither of
them is any more free than anybody else to embark upon the task of
creating a Stateoverriding warpreventing organisation of the world
He has been created by a system and he is bound to a system his
concern is with the interests of the people of Switzerland or of the
United States of America President Wilson for example is quite
sufficiently occupied by the affairs of the White House by the clash of
political parties by interferences with American overseas trade and the
security of American citizens He has no more time to give to projects
for the fundamental reconstruction of international relationships than
has any recruit drilling in England or any captain on an ocean liner
or any engineer in charge of a going engine
We are all indeed busy with the things that come to hand every day We
are all anxious for a permanent world peace but we are all up to the
neck in things that leave us no time to attend to this world peace that
nearly every sane man desires
Meanwhile a small minority of people who trade upon
contentionmilitarists ambitious kings and statesmen war contractors
loan mongers sensational journalistsfollow up their interests and
start and sustain war
There lies the paradoxical reality of this question Our first inquiry
lands us into the elucidation of this deadlock Nearly everybody desires
a world peace and yet there is not apparent anywhere any man free and
able and willing to establish it while on the other hand there are a
considerable number of men in positions of especial influence and power
who will certainly resist the arrangements that are essential to its
establishment
But does this exhaust the question and must we conclude that mankind is
doomed to a perpetual futile struggling of States and nations and
peoplesbreaking ever and again into war The answer to that would
probably be Yes if it were not for the progress of war War is
continually becoming more scientific more destructive more coldly
logical more intolerant of noncombatants and more exhausting of any
kind of property There is every reason to believe that it will continue
to intensify these characteristics By doing so it may presently bring
about a state of affairs that will supply just the lacking elements that
are needed for the development of a world peace
I would venture to suggest that the present war is doing so now that it
is producing changes in mens minds that may presently give us both the
needed energy and the needed organisation from which a world direction
may develop
The first most distinctive thing about this conflict is the
exceptionally searching way in which it attacks human happiness No war
has ever destroyed happiness so widely It has not only killed and
wounded an unprecedented proportion of the male population of all the
combatant nations but it has also destroyed wealth beyond precedent It
has also destroyed freedomof movement of speech of economic
enterprise Hardly anyone alive has escaped the worry of it and the
threat of it It has left scarcely a life untouched and made scarcely a
life happier There is a limit to the principle that everybodys
business is nobodys business The establishment of a world State
which was interesting only to a few cranks and visionaries before the
war is now the lively interest of a very great number of people They
inquire about it they have become accessible to ideas about it
Peace organisation seems indeed to be following the lines of public
sanitation Everybody in England for example was bored by the
discussion of sanitationuntil the great cholera epidemic Everybody
thought public health a very desirable thing but nobody thought it
intensely and overridingly desirable Then the interest in sanitation
grew lively and people exerted themselves to create responsible
organisations Crimes of violence again were neglected in the great
cities of Europe until the danger grew to dimensions that evolved the
police There come occasions when the normal concentration of an
individual upon his own immediate concerns becomes impossible as for
instance when a man who is stocktaking in his business premises
discovers that the house next door is on fire A great many people who
have never troubled their heads about anything but their own purely
personal and selfish interests are now realising that quite a multitude
of houses about them are ablaze and that the fire is spreading
That is one change the war will bring about that will make for world
peace a quickened general interest in its possibility Another is the
certainty that the war will increase the number of devoted and fanatic
characters available for disinterested effort Whatever other outcome
this war may have it means that there lies ahead a period of extreme
economic and political dislocation The credit system has been strained
and will be strained and will need unprecedented readjustments In the
past such phases of uncertainty sudden impoverishment and disorder as
certainly lie ahead of us have meant for a considerable number of minds
a releaseor if you prefer it a flightfrom the habitual and
selfish Types of intense religiosity of devotion and of endeavour are
let loose and there will be much more likelihood that we may presently
find what it is impossible to find now a number of devoted men and
women ready to give their whole lives with a quasireligious
enthusiasm to this great task of peace establishment finding in such
impersonal work a refuge from the disappointments limitations losses
and sorrows of their personal lifea refuge we need but little in more
settled and more prosperous periods They will be but the outstanding
individuals in a very universal quickening And simultaneously with this
quickening of the general imagination by experience there are certain
other developments in progress that point very clearly to a change under
the pressure of this war of just those institutions of nationality
kingship diplomacy and interState competition that have hitherto stood
most effectually in the way of a world pacification The considerations
that seem to point to this third change are very convincing to my mind
The real operating cause that is I believe going to break down the
deadlock that has hitherto made a supreme court and a federal government
for the world at large a dream lies in just that possibility of an
inconclusive peace which so many people seem to dread Germany I
believe is going to be beaten but not completely crushed by this war
she is going to be left militarist and united with Austria and Hungary
and unchanged in her essential nature and out of that state of affairs
comes I believe the hope for an ultimate confederation of the nations
of the earth
Because in the face of a league of the Central European Powers
attempting recuperation cherishing revenge dreaming of a renewal of
the struggle it becomes impossible for the British the French the
Belgians Russians Italians or Japanese to think any longer of settling
their differences by war among themselves To do so will mean the
creation of opportunity for the complete reinstatement of German
militarism It will open the door for a conclusive German hegemony
Now however clumsy and confused the diplomacy of these present Allies
may be challenged constantly as it is by democracy and hampered by a
free venal and irresponsible Press in at least three of their
countries the necessity they will be under will be so urgent and so
evident that it is impossible to imagine that they will not set up some
permanent organ for the direction and coordination of their joint
international relationships It may be a queerly constituted body at
first it may be of a merely diplomatic pretension it may be called a
Congress or any old name of that sort but essentially its business
will be to conduct a joint fiscal military and naval policy to keep
the peace in the Balkans and Asia to establish a relationship with
China and organise joint and several arbitration arrangements with
America And it must develop something more sure and swift than our
present diplomacy One of its chief concerns will be the right of way
through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles and the watching of the
forces that stir up conflict in the Balkans and the Levant It must have
unity enough for that it must be much more than a mere leisurely
unauthoritative conference of representatives
For precisely similar reasons it seems to me incredible that the two
great Central European Powers should ever fall into sustained conflict
again with one another They too will be forced to create some
overriding body to prevent so suicidal a possibility America too it
may be will develop some PanAmerican equivalent Probably the hundred
millions of Latin America may achieve a method of unity and then deal
on equal terms with the present United States The thing has been ably
advocated already in South America Whatever appearances of separate
sovereignties are kept up after the war the practical outcome of the
struggle is quite likely to be this that there will be only three great
World Powers leftthe antiGerman allies the allied Central Europeans
the PanAmericans And it is to be noted that whatever the constituents
of these three Powers may be none of them is likely to be a monarchy
They may include monarchies as England includes dukedoms But they will
be overriding alliances not overriding rulers I leave it to the
mathematician to work out exactly how much the chances of conflict are
diminished when there are practically only three Powers in the world
instead of some scores And these new Powers will be in certain respects
unlike any existing European States None of the three Powers will be
small or homogeneous enough to serve dynastic ambitions embody a
national or racial Kultur or fall into the grip of any group of
financial enterprises They will be more comprehensive less romantic
and more businesslike altogether They will be to use a phrase
suggested a year or so ago Great States And the war threat between
the three will be so plain and definite the issues will be so lifted
out of the spheres of merely personal ambition and national feeling
that I do not see why the negotiating means the standing conference of
the three should not ultimately become the needed nucleus of the World
State for which at present we search the world in vain
There are more ways than one to the World State and this second
possibility of a postwar conference and a conference of the Allies
growing almost unawares into a pacific organisation of the world since
it goes on directly from existing institutions since it has none of the
quality of a clean break with the past which the idea of an immediate
World State and Pax Mundi involves and more particularly since it
neither abolishes nor has in it anything to shock fundamentally the
princes the diplomatists the lawyers the statesmen and politicians
the nationalists and suspicious people since it gives them years in
which to change and die out and reappear in new forms and since at the
same time it will command the support of every intelligent human being
who gets his mind clear enough from his circumstances to understand its
import is a far more credible hope than the hope of anything coming de
novo out of Hague Foundations or the manifest logic of the war
But of course there weighs against these hopes the possibility that
the Allied Powers are too various in their nature too biased too
feeble intellectually and imaginatively to hold together and maintain
any institution for cooperation The British Press may be too silly not
to foster irritation and suspicion we may get Carsonism on a larger
scale trading on the resuscitation of dying hatreds the British and
Russian diplomatists may play annoying tricks upon one another by sheer
force of habit There may be many troubles of that sort Even then I do
not see that the hope of an ultimate world peace vanishes But it will
be a Roman world peace made in Germany and there will have to be
several more great wars before it is established Germany is too
homogeneous yet to have begun the lesson of compromise and the
renunciation of the dream of national conquest The Germans are a
national not an imperial people France has learnt that through
suffering and Britain and Russia because for two centuries they have
been imperial and not national systems The German conception of world
peace is as yet a conception of German ascendancy The Allied conception
becomes perforce one of mutual toleration
But I will not press this inquiry farther now It is as I said at the
beginning a preliminary exploration of one of the great questions with
which I propose to play in these articles The possibility I have
sketched is the one that most commends itself to me as probable After a
more detailed examination of the big operating forces at present working
in the world we may be in a position to revise these suggestions with a
greater confidence and draw our net of probabilities a little tighter
II THE END OF THE WAR1
The prophet who emerges with the most honour from this war is Bloch It
must be fifteen or sixteen years ago since this gifted Pole made his
forecast of the future Perhaps it is more for the French translation
of his book was certainly in existence before the Boer War His case was
that war between antagonists of fairly equal equipment must end in a
deadlock because of the continually increasing defensive efficiency of
entrenched infantry This would give the defensive an advantage over the
most brilliant strategy and over considerably superior numbers that
would completely discourage all aggression He concluded that war was
played out
Footnote 1 This chapter was originally a newspaper article It was
written in December 1915 and published about the middle of January
Some of it has passed from the quality of anticipation to achievement
but I do not see that it needs any material revision on that account
His book was very carefully studied in Germany As a humble disciple of
Bloch I should have realised this but I did not and that failure led
me into some unfortunate prophesying at the outbreak of the war I
judged Germany by the Kaiser and by the Kaiserworship which I saw in
Berlin I thought that he was a theatrical person who would dream of
vast massed attacks and tremendous cavalry charges and that he would
