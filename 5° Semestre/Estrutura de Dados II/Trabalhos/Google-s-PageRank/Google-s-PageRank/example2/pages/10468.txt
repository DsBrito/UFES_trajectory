livelihood and a doubtful position in the lower stratas of social
communion But you interfered You came into their lives abruptly
appearing from those horrid Western wilds with an amazing accumulation
of money and a demand that your three nieces become your special
protegees And what is the result
The little man looked up with a charming smile of good humored raillery
His keen gray eyes sparkled as mischievously as a schoolboys Softly he
rubbed the palms of his hands together as if enjoying the situation
What is it Martha my dear What is the result he asked
Youve raised them from their lowly condition to a sphere in which they
reign as queens the envy of all who know them Youve lavished your
millions upon them unsparingly they are not only presumptive heiresses
but already possessed of independent fortunes Ah you think youve been
generous to these girls dont you John Merrick  Go on Martha go
on
Youve taken them abroadyou took my own daughter John Merrick and
left me at homeyouve lugged your three nieces to the mountains and
carried them to the seashore You even encouraged them to enlist in an
unseemly campaign to elect that young imbecile Kenneth Forbes and
Oh Martha Martha Get to the point if you can Im going
presently
Not until youve heard me out Youve given your nieces every advantage
in your power save one and the neglect of that one thing renders futile
all else you have accomplished
Now indeed her listener seemed perplexed He passed a hand over his
shiny bald head as if to stimulate thought and exorcise bewilderment
What is it then What have I neglected was his mild enquiry
To give those girls their proper standing in society
He started smiled then looked grave
Youre talking foolishly he said Why confound it Martha theyre
as good girls as ever lived Theyre highly respected and  Sir I
refer to Fashionable Society The capitals indicate the impressive
manner in which Mrs Merrick pronounced those words
I guess money makes folks fashionable dont it Martha
No indeed How ignorant you are John Can you not understand that
there is a cultured aristocratic and exclusive Society in New York that
millions will not enable one to gain entree to
Oh is there Then Im helpless
You are not sir
Eh I thought you said
Listen John and for heavens sake try for once to be receptive I am
speaking not only for the welfare of my daughter Louise but for Beth
and Patricia Your nieces are charming girls all three With the
advantages you have given them they may well become social celebrities
Hmm Would they be happier so
Of course Every true woman longs for social distinction especially if
it seems difficult to acquire Nothing is dearer to a girls heart than
to win acceptance by the right social set And New York society is the
most exclusive in America
Im afraid it will continue to exclude our girls Martha
Not if you do your duty John
That reminds me What is your idea of my duty Martha Youve been
talking in riddles so far he protested shifting uneasily in his
chair
Let me explain more concisely then Your millions John Merrick have
made you really famous even in this wealthy metropolis In the city and
at your club you must meet with men who have the entree to the most
desirable social circles men who might be induced to introduce your
nieces to their families whose endorsement would effect their proper
presentation
Nonsense
It isnt nonsense at all
Then blamed if I know what youre driving at
Youre very obtuse
I wont agree to that till I know what obtuse means See here
Martha you say this social position that the girls are so crazy
forbut theyve never said anything to me about itcant be bought
In the next breath you urge me to buy it Phoo Youre a thoughtless
silly woman Martha and let your wild ambitions run away with your
common sense
Mrs Merrick sighed but stubbornly maintained her position
I dont suggest buying such people not at all John Its what is
calledahahinfluence or or
Or pull Pull is a better word Martha Do you imagine theres any
value in social position that can be acquired by pull
Of course It has to be acquired some wayif one is not born to it As
a matter of fact Louise is entitled through her connection with my
family
Pshaw I knew your family Martha he interrupted An arrant lot of
humbugs
John Merrick
Dont get riled Its the truth I knew em On her fathers side
Louise has just as much to brag aboutan no more We Merricks never
amounted to much an didnt hanker to trip the light fantastic in
swell society Once though when I was a boy I had a cousin who
spelled down the whole crowd at a spellinbee We were quite proud of
him then but he went wrong after his triumph poor fellow and became a
book agent Now Martha I imagine this talk of yours is all hot air
and worked off on me not because the girls want society but because you
want it for em Its all your ambition Ill bet a peanut
You misjudge me as usual John I am urging a matter of simple
justice Your nieces are lovely girls fitted to shine in any sphere of
life she continued knowing his weak point and diplomatically
fostering it Our girls have youth accomplishments moneyeverything
to fit them for social triumphs The winter season is now approaching
the people are flocking back to town from their country homes
fashionable gaieties and notable events will soon hold full sway The
dear girls are surely entitled to enjoy these things dont you think
Arent they worthy the best that life has to offer And why shouldnt
they enter society if you do your full duty Once get them properly
introduced and they will be able to hold their own with perfect ease
Give me the credit for knowing these things John and try to help your
nieces to attain their ambition
But is it their ambition he asked doubtfully
They have not said so in words but I can assure you it is their
ambition because all three are sensible spirited young women who
live in this age and not the one you yourself knew a half century or so
ago
Mr Merrick sighed and rubbed his head again Then he slowly rose
Mornin Martha he said with a somewhat abstracted nod at his
sisterinlaw This is a new idea to me Ill think it over
CHAPTER II
A QUESTION OF PULL
John Merricks face was not so cheery as usual as he made his way into
the city This suggestion of Martha Merricks regarding his inattention
to duty to his beloved nieces was no easy nut to crack
He knew his sisterinlaw to be a wordlyminded frivolous woman with
many trivial ambitions but in this instance he had misgivings that she
might be right What did he John Merrick know of select society A
poor man of humble origin he had wandered into the infantile embryo
West years ago and there amassed a fortune When he retired and returned
to civilization he found his greatest reward In the discovery of three
charming nieces all as poor as Jobs turkey but struggling along
bravely each in her individual characteristic way and well worthy
their doting uncles affectionate admiration Mrs Merrick had recited
some of the advantages they had derived from the advent of this rich
relative but even she could not guess how devoted the man was to the
welfare of these three fortunate girls nor how his kindly simple heart
resented the insinuation that he was neglecting anything that might
contribute to their happiness
Possession of money had never altered John Merricks native simplicity
He had no extravagant tastes dressed quietly and lived the life of the
people On this eventful morning the man of millions took a crosstown
car to the elevated station and climbed the stairs to his train Once
seated and headed cityward he took out his memorandum book to see what
engagements he had for the day There were three for the afternoon At
twelve oclock he had promised to meet Von Taer
Hmm Von Taer
Gazing reflectively from the window he remembered a conversation with a
prominent banker some month or so before Von Taer the banker had
said is an aristocrat with an independent fortune who clings to the
brokerage business because he inherited it from his father and
grandfather I hold that such a man has no moral right to continue in
business He should retire and give the other fellow a chance
Why do you call him an aristocrat Mr Merrick had enquired
Because his family is so ancient that it shames the ark itself I
imagine his ancestors might have furnished Noah the lumber to build his
ship In New York the 400 all kowtow to Von Taer
Seems to me he has the right to be a broker if he wants to asserted
Mr Merrick
The right yes But between us Mr Merrick this society swell has no
mental capacity to handle such an uncertain business Hes noted for
doing unwarranted things To me its a marvel that Von Taer hasnt
shipwrecked the family fortunes long ago Luck has saved him not
foresight
That speech of a few weeks ago now seemed prophetic to John Merrick
Within a few days the aristocratic broker had encountered financial
difficulties and been forced to appeal to Mr Merrick to whom he
obtained an introduction through a mutual friend Von Taer was
doubtless solvent for he controlled large means but unless a saving
hand was extended at this juncture his losses were sure to be severe
and might even cripple him seriously
All this Mr Merrick shrewdly considered in the space of a few moments
As he left the train he looked at his watch and found it was barely
eleven He decided not to await the hour of appointment With his usual
brisk stride he walked to Von Taers offices and was promptly admitted
to the brokers sanctum
Hedrik Von Taer was a fine looking man tall grave of dignified
demeanor and courteous manners He stood until his visitor was seated
and with a gesture of deference invited him to open the conversation
Ive decided to make you the loan Von Taer began Mr Merrick in his
practical matteroffact way Three hundred thousand wasnt it Call
on Major Doyle at my office this afternoon and hell arrange it for
you
An expression of relief crossed the brokers face
You are very kind sir he answered I assure you I fully appreciate
the accommodation
Glad to help you responded the millionaire briskly Then he paused
with marked abruptness It occurred to him he had a difficult
proposition to make to this man To avoid the cold enquiring eyes now
fixed upon him he pulled out a cigar and deliberately cut the end Von
Taer furnished him a match He smoked a while in silence
This loan sir he finally began is freely made There are no
strings tied to it I dont want you to feel Im demanding any sort of
return But the truth is you have it in your power to grant me a
favor
Von Taer bowed
Mr Merrick has generously placed me under an obligation it will afford
me pleasure to repay said he But his eyes held an uneasy look
nevertheless
Its this way explained the other Ive three niecesfine girls
Von Taerwho will some day inherit my money They are already
independent financially and theyre educated wellbred and amiable
young women Take my word for it
I am sure your statements are justified Mr Merrick Yet Hedrik Von
Taers face usually unexpressive denoted blank mystification What
connection could these girls have with the favor to be demanded
Got any girls yourself Von Taer
A daughter sir My only child
Grown up
A young lady now sir
Then youll understand Im a plain uneducated man myself Never been
any nearer swell society than a Fifth Avenue stage My money has given
me commercial position but no social one worth mentioning Your 400s
a bunch I cant break into nohow
A slight smile hovered over the others lips but he quickly controlled
it
They tell me though continued the speaker that your family has
long ago climbed into the top notch of society Youre one o the big
guns in the battery an hold the fort against all comers
Von Taer merely bowed It was scarcely necessary to either admit or
contradict the statement Uncle John was a little indignant that his
companion showed no disposition to assist him in his explanation which
a clear head might now easily comprehend So with his usual frankness
he went directly to the point
Id like my girls to get into the bestthe most selectcircles he
announced Theyre good and pretty and wellmannered so it strikes me
theyre entitled to the best there is agoing I dont want to mix with
your swell crowd myself because I aint fit likewise the outfit aint
much to my taste askin your pardon but with women its different
They need to stand high an shine bright to make em really happy and
if any special lot is particularly exclusive an highfalutin thats
the crowd they long to swarm with Its human naturefemale human
nature anyhow You catch my idea Von Taer dont you
I think so Mr Merrick Yet I fail to see how I can be of service to
you in gratifying the ambition of your charming nieces  Then Ill
go and you may forget what Ive said The visitor arose and took his
hat from the table It was only a fool notion anyway just a thought
badly expressed to help my girls to a toy that money cant buy
Hedrik Von Taer gazed steadily into the mans face There was something
in the simple honest selfabnegation of this wealthy and important
person that won the respect of all he met The brokers stern eyes
softened a bit as he gazed and he allowed a fugitive smile due to his
own change of attitude to wreathe his thin lips againjust for an
instant
Sit down please Mr Merrick he requested and rather reluctantly
Uncle John resumed his seat You may not have an especially clear idea
of New York society and I want to explain my recent remark so that you
will understand it What is called the 400 may or may not exist but
certainly it is no distinct league or association It may perhaps be
regarded as a figure of speech to indicate how few are really admitted
to the most exclusive circles Moreover there can be no dominant
leader of society here for the reason that not all grades of society
would recognize the supremacy of any one set or clique These cliques
exist for various reasons They fraternize generally but keep well
within their own circles Kindred tastes attract some ancient lineage
others There is an ultrafashionable set a sporting set a literary
set an aristocratic set a rather fast set a theatrical setand so
on These may all lay claim with certain justice to membership in good
society Their circles are to an extent exclusive because some
distinction must mark the eligibility of members And outside each
luminous sphere hovers a multitude eager to pass the charmed circle and
so acquire recognition Often it is hard to separate the initiate from
the uninitiate even by those most expert Is it difficult to comprehend
such a condition as I have described Mr Merrick
Somewhat Mr Von Taer The wonder to me is why people waste time in
such foolishness
It is the legitimate occupation of many the folly of unwise ambition
impels others There is a fascination about social life that appeals to
the majority of natures Let us compare society to a mountain whose
sides are a steep incline difficult to mount To stand upon the
summit to become the cynosure of all eyes is a desire inherent
seemingly in all humanity for humanity loves distinction In the
scramble toward the peak many fall by the wayside others deceive
themselves by imagining they have attained the apex when they are far
from it It is a game Mr Merrick just as business is a game politics
a game and war a game You know how few really win
Here said Uncle John musingly is a philosophy I did not expect
from you Von Taer They tell me youre one who stands on top the peak
And you were born that way and didnt have to climb Seems to me you
rather scorn the crowd thats trying to climb to an eminence you never
had to win That wouldnt be my way And I suspect that if the crowd
wasnt trying to climb to you your own position wouldnt be worth a
cotton hat
Von Taer had no answer to this criticism Perhaps he scarcely heard it
for he appeared lost in a brown study Finally he said  Will you
permit my daughter to call upon your nieces Mr Merrick
Of course sir
Then kindly give me their addresses
Uncle John wrote them on a slip of paper
You may now dismiss the subject from your mind sir as you lately
advised me to do Whatever may be accomplished in the direction you have
suggested I will gladly undertake If I succeed it will be exceedingly
gratifying to us all I am sure
Mr Merrick left the office in a rather humbled and testy mood He
disliked to ask favors at any time and now felt that he had confided
himself to the mercy of this callous aristocrat and met with a distinct
rebuff
But he had done it for the sake of his beloved niecesand they would
never know what humiliation this unsatisfactory interview had cost him
CHAPTER III
DIANA
Diana Von Taer can not be called a type She was individual
Aristocratic to her finger tips she was unlike all other aristocrats
An admitted queen of society her subjects were few and indifferent She
possessed ancient lineage was highly accomplished had been born to the
purple as the saying is but none of these things conspired to make her
the curious creature she was
As we make her acquaintance she is twentythree years of ageand looks
eighteen She is tall and slender and carries her handsome form with
exquisite grace Diana is never abrupt her voice is ever modulated to
soft even tones she rises from a chair or couch with the lithe
sinuous motion of a serpent uncoiling
Her face critically regarded is not so admirable as her form The
features are a trifle too elongated and their delicacy is marred by a
nose a bit broad and unshapely and a mouth with thin lips primly set
Her dark eyes might be magnificent if wide open but through the narrow
slits of their lids half hidden by long curling lashes the eyes peer
at you with a cold watchful intent gaze that carries a certain uncanny
and disconcerting fascination
Yet the girl is essentially feminine If you refrain from meeting that
discomfiting gazeand her familiars have learned to avoid itDiana
impresses you as being graceful dainty and possessed of charming
manners Her taste in dress is perfect She converses fluently on many
topics It is her custom to rise at ten oclock whatever time she may
have retired the night before to read until luncheon to devote the
remainder of her day to the requirements of society
Eligible young men of admitted social standing call upon Diana at such
intervals as the proprieties require They chatter small talk and are
careful to address her with deference With an exception to be referred
to later these young men have no more thought of flirting with Miss
Von Taer than they would with the statue of the goddess her namesake
Her dinner parties and entertainments are very successful She is
greatly admired per se but has no intimate friends
When her mother died some years before an aunt had come to live with
Diana and now posed as her chaperon Mrs Cameron was a stolid
corpulent lady with a countenance perpetually placid and an habitual
aversion to displaying intellect Her presence in the establishment
although necessary was frankly ignored Fortunately she never obtruded
herself
Hedrik Von Taer was passionately devoted to his daughter He alone
perhaps of all the world thoroughly understood her and appreciated her
talents She may have frightened him at times but that only added to
his admiration In return Diana displayed a calm but affectionate
regard for her father
Often after dinner these two would pass an hour together in a corner of
the drawingroom where the cold gray eyes of the man met the intent
halfveiled glance of the girl with perfect understanding They talked
of many things including business Hedrik had no secrets from his
daughter  The desperate condition of his finances when he had been
caught in a corner on wheat and nearly crushed had not dismayed her
in the least It was she who had counseled him to appeal to John
Merrick since the name and fame of the eccentric millionaire were
familiar to her as to him
He related to Diana his interview with Mr Merrick on his return home
He was saved The three hundred thousand were now in the bank to his
credit and he could weather the coming storm easilyperhaps with
profit In a tone half amused half serious he told her of the little
millionaires desire to secure entree into good society for his three
nieces
Diana laughed with her lips her eyes never laughed Then she took in
her hand the paper containing the addresses of the three girls and
regarded it thoughtfully
It is a curious request mon pere she said in her soft even
tones but one we cannot diplomatically disregard Provided however
Yes Diana as she paused
Provided these prospective debutantes are not wholly impossible
I realize that returned her father John Merrick is a great power in
the city He has been useful to me and may be again I have this chance
to win him But the man is very common clay despite his wealth and his
three nieces are likely to be made of the same material Should they
prove impossible you cannot well descend to introducing them to our
set
I am not certain of that sir said the girl with a pretty shrug My
position is too secure to be jeopardized by any error of this sort I
believe I may introduce these girls without risk I shall not vouch for
them too strongly and after their debut they must stand or fall on
their own merits
It is something a Von Taer has never yet done remarked the man
gravely
To commercialize his social position But father dear the age is fast
commercializing everything I think our especial set is as yet
comparatively free from contamination by the lately rich but even
among us money has glossed many offenses that a generation ago would
have meant social ostracism
He nodded
That is true Diana
Life with me is a bit dull as well Everlasting routine however
admirable is tiresome I scent amusement in this adventure which I
have decided to undertake With your permission I will see these girls
and quickly decide their fate Should they prove not too dreadfully
outre you may look to see them my especial proteges
I leave all to your discretion Diana returned Von Taer with a sigh
If in the end some of the more particular venture to reproach them
It will not matter interrupted the daughter lightly as her dark
eyes narrowed to a hairs breadth Any who dares reproach Diana Von
Taer will afford her interesting occupation And to offset that remote
contingency we shall permanently enslave the powerful John Merrick I
understand he is hard as nails in financial matters but to us the man
has disclosed his one weaknessambition to promote his three nieces
Since we have discovered this vulnerable point let us take advantage of
it I am satisfied the loan of three hundred thousand was but a
lureand how cleverly the man gauged us
Von Taer scowled
Get your wraps Diana The carriage is waiting and we are due at Mrs
Doldringhams crush
CHAPTER IV
THE THREE NIECES
The Von Taers did not affect motor cars In some circles the carriage
and pair is still considered the more aristocratic mode of conveyance
Established customs do not readily give way to fads and freaks
Consulting her memoranda as she rode along in her handsome tastefully
appointed equipage Diana found that Louise Merrick one of the three
girls she had set out to discover was the nearest on her route
Presently she rang the bell at the Merrick residence an eminently
respectable dwelling in a desirable neighborhood
Diana could not resist a sigh of relief as her observant glance noted
this detail A dignified butler ushered her into a reception room and
departed with her card
It was now that the visitors nose took an upward tendency as she
critically examined her surroundings The furnishings were abominable a
mixture of distressingly new articles with those evidently procured
from dealers in antiquities Money had been lavished here but good
taste was absent To understand thisfor Miss Von Taer gauged the
condition trulyit is necessary to know something of Mrs Martha
Merrick
This lady the relict of John Merricks only brother was endowed with a
mediocre mind and a towering ambition When left a widow with an only
daughter she had schemed and contrived in endless ways to maintain an
appearance of competency on a meager income Finally she divided her
capital derived from her husbands life insurance into three equal
parts which she determined to squander in three years in an attempt to
hoodwink the world with the belief that she was wealthy Before the
three years were ended her daughter Louise would be twenty and by that
time she must have secured a rich parti and been safely married In
return for this sacrifice the girl was to see that her mother was made
comfortable thereafter
This worldly and foolish design was confided to Louise when she was only
seventeen and her unformed mind easily absorbed her mothers silly
ambition It was a pity for Louise Merrick possessed a nature sweet
and lovable as well as instinctively refineda nature derived from her
dead father and with little true sympathy with Mrs Merricks
unscrupulous schemes But at that age a girl is easily influenced so it
is little wonder that under such tuition Louise became calculating sly
and deceitful to a most deplorable degree
Such acquired traits bade fair in the end to defeat Mrs Merricks
carefully planned coup for the daughter had a premature love affair
with a youth outside the pale of eligibility Louise ignored the fact
that he had been disinherited by his father and in her reckless
infatuation would have sacrificed her mother without thought or remorse
The dreadful finale had only been averted by the advent of Uncle John
Merrick who had changed the life plans of the widow and her heedless
daughter and promptly saved the situation
John Merrick did not like his sisterinlaw but he was charmed by his
lovely niece and took her at once to his affectionate old heart He saw
the faults of Louise clearly but also appreciated her sweeter
qualities Under his skillful guidance she soon redeemed herself and
regained control of her better nature The girl was not yet perfect by
any means she was to an extent artificial and secretive and her
thoughtless flirtations were far from wise but her two cousins and her
uncle had come to know and understand her good points They not only
bore patiently with her volatile nature but strove to influence her to
demonstrate her inherent good qualities
In one way her mothers calculating training had been most effective
Louise was not only a dainty lovely maid to the eye but her manners
were gracious and winning and she had that admirable selfpossession
which quickly endears one even to casual acquaintances She did not
impress more intimate friends as being wholly sincere yet there was
nothing in her acts since that one escapade referred to that merited
severe disapproval
Of course the brilliant idea of foisting her precious daughter upon the
select society of the metropolis was original with Mrs Merrick
Louise was well content with things as they were but not so the
mother The rise from poverty to affluence the removal of all cares and
burdens from her mind had merely fostered still greater ambitions
Uncle Johns generosity had endowed each of his three nieces with an
ample fortune I want em to enjoy the good things of life while
theyre at an age to enjoy em he said for the older one gets the
fewer things are found to be enjoyable Thats my experience anyhow
He also told the girls frankly that they were to inherit
jointlyalthough not equallyhis entire fortune Yet even this glowing
prospect did not satisfy Mrs Merrick Since all her plans for Louise
from the very beginning had been founded on personal selfishness she
now proposed to have her daughter gain admission to recognized
fashionable society in order that she might herself bask in the
reflection of the glory so obtained and take her place with the proud
matrons who formed the keystone of such society  After carefully
considering ways and means to gain her object she had finally conceived
the idea of utilizing Mr Merrick She well knew Uncle John would not
consider one niece to the exclusion of the others and had therefore
used his influence to get all three girls properly introduced
Therefore her delight and excitement were intense when the butler
brought up Dianas card and she realized that the perfectly swell Miss
Von Taer was seated in her reception room She rushed to Louise who
wholly innocent of any knowledge of the intrigue which had led to this
climax opened her blue eyes in astonishment and said with a gasp
Oh mother what shall I do
Do Why go down and make yourself agreeable of course Its your
chance my dear your great chance in life Gogo Dont for heavens
sake keep her waiting
Louise went down In her most affable and gracious way she approached
the visitor and said
It is very nice of you to call upon me I am so glad to meet Miss Von
Taer  Diana passing conversational nothings with the young girl was
pleased by her appearance and selfpossession This aspirant for social
honors was fresh fair and attractive with a flow of small talk at her
tongues end
Really thought the fastidious visitor this one at least will do
me no discredit If she is a fair sample of the others we shall get
along very nicely In this enterprise
