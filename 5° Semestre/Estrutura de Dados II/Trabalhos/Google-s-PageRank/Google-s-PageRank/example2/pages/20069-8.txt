LUISA TETRAZZINI
INTRODUCTORY SKETCH OF THE CAREER OF THE WORLDFAMOUS PRIMA DONNA
Luisa Tetrazzini the most famous Italian coloratura soprano of the
day declares that she began to sing before she learned to talk Her
parents were not musical but her elder sister now the wife of the
eminent conductor Cleofante Campanini was a public singer of
established reputation and her success roused her young sisters
ambition to become a great artist Her parents were well to do her
father having a large army furnishing store in Florence and they did
not encourage her in her determination to become a prima donna One
prima donna said her father was enough for any family
Luisa did not agree with him If one prima donna is good she argued
why would not two be better So she never desisted from her importunity
until she was permitted to become a pupil of Professor Coccherani vocal
instructor at the Lycee At this time she had committed to memory more
than a dozen grand opera roles and at the end of six months the
professor confessed that he could do nothing more for her voice that
she was ready for a career
She made her bow to the Florentine opera going public one of the most
critical in Italy as Inez in Meyerbeers LAfricaine and her
success was so pronounced that she was engaged at a salary of 100 a
month a phenomenal beginning for a young singer Queen Margherita was
present on the occasion and complimented her highly and prophesied for
her a great career She asked the trembling debutante how old she was
and in the embarrassment of the moment Luisa made herself six years
older than she really was This is one noteworthy instance in which a
public singer failed to discount her age
Fame came speedily but for a long time it was confined to Europe and
Latin America She sang seven seasons in St Petersburg three in
Mexico two in Madrid four in Buenos Aires and even on the Pacific
coast of America before she appeared in New York She had sung Lucia
more than 200 times before her first appearance at Covent Garden and
the twenty curtain calls she received on that occasion came as the
greatest surprise of her career She had begun to believe that she could
never be appreciated by Englishspeaking audiences and the ovation
almost overcame her
It was by the merest chance that Mme Tetrazzini ever came to the
Manhattan Opera House in New York The divas own account of her
engagement is as follows
I was in London and for a wonder I had a week a wet week on my
hands You know people will do anything in a wet week in London
There were contracts from all over the Continent and South America
pending There was much discussion naturally in regard to settlements
and arrangements of one kind and another
Suddenly just like thatshe makes a butterfly gestureM
Hammerstein came and just like thata duplicate gestureI made up
my mind that I would come here If his offer to me had been seven days
later I should not have signed and if I had not I should undoubtedly
never have come for a contract that I might have signed to go elsewhere
would probably have been for a number of years
Voice experts confess that they are not able to solve the mystery of
Mme Tetrazzinis wonderful management of her breathing
It is perfectly natural she says I breathe low down in the
diaphragm not as some do high up in the upper part of the chest I
always hold some breath in reserve for the crescendos employing only
what is absolutely necessary and I renew the breath wherever it is
easiest
In breathing I find as in other matters pertaining to singing that as
one goes on and practices no matter how long one may have been singing
there are constantly new surprises awaiting one You may have been
accustomed for years to take a note in a certain way and after a long
while you discover that while it is a very good way there is a
better
Breath Control The Foundation of Singing
There is only one way to sing correctly and that is to sing naturally
easily comfortably
The height of vocal art is to have no apparent method but to be able to
sing with perfect facility from one end of the voice to the other
emitting all the notes clearly and yet with power and having each note
of the scale sound the same in quality and tonal beauty as the ones
before and after
There are many methods which lead to the goal of natural singingthat
is to say the production of the voice with ease beauty and with
perfect control
Some of the greatest teachers in the world reach this point apparently
by diverging roads
Around the art of singing there has been formed a cult which includes an
entire jargon of words meaning one thing to the singer and another thing
to the rest of the world and which very often doesnt mean the same
thing to two singers of different schools
In these talks with you I am going to try to use the simplest words and
the few idioms which I will have to take from my own language I will
translate to you as clearly as I can so that there can be no
misunderstanding
Certainly the highest art and a lifetime of work and study are
necessary to acquire an easy emission of tone
There are quantities of wonderful natural voices particularly among the
young people of Switzerland and Italy and the American voice is
especially noted for its purity and the beauty of its tone in the high
registers But these naturally untrained voices soon break or fail if
they are used much unless the singer supplements the natural Godgiven
vocal gifts with a conscious understanding of how the vocal apparatus
should be used
The singer must have some knowledge of his or her anatomical structure
particularly the structure of the throat mouth and face with its
resonant cavities which are so necessary for the right production of
the voice
Besides that the lungs and diaphragm and the whole breathing apparatus
must be understood because the foundation of singing is breathing and
breath control
A singer must be able to rely on his breath just as he relies upon the
solidity of the ground beneath his feet
A shaky uncontrolled breath is like a rickety foundation on which
nothing can be built and until that foundation has been developed and
strengthened the wouldbe singer need expect no satisfactory results
From the girls to whom I am talking especially I must now ask a
sacrificethe singer cannot wear tight corsets and should not wear
corsets of any kind which come up higher than the lowest rib
In other words the corset must be nothing but a belt but with as much
hip length as the wearer finds convenient and necessary
In order to insure proper breathing capacity it is understood that the
clothing must be absolutely loose around the chest and also across the
lower part of the back for one should breathe with the back of the
lungs as well as with the front
In my years of study and work I have developed my own breathing capacity
until I am somewhat the despair of the fashionable modiste but I have a
diaphragm and a breath on which I can rely at all times
In learning to breathe it is well to think of the lungs as empty sacks
into which the air is dropping like a weight so that you think first of
filling the bottom of your lungs then the middle part and so on until
no more air can be inhaled
Inhale short breaths through the nose This of course is only an
exercise for breath development
Now begin to inhale from the bottom of the lungs first
Exhale slowly and feel as if you were pushing the air against your
chest If you can get this sensation later when singing it will help you
very greatly to get control of the breath and to avoid sending too much
breath through the vocal chords
The breath must be sent out in an even steady flow
You will notice when you begin to sing if you watch yourself very
carefully that first you will try to inhale too much air secondly
you will either force it all out at once making a breathy note or in
trying to control the flow of air by the diaphragm you will suddenly
cease to send it forth at all and will be making the sound by pressure
from the throat
There must never be any pressure from the throat The sound must be made
from the continued flow of air
You must learn to control this flow of air so that no muscular action
of the throat can shut it off
Open the throat wide and start your note by the pressure breath The
physical sensation should be first an effort on the part of the
diaphragm to press the air up against the chest box then the sensation
of a perfectly open throat and lastly the sensation that the air is
passing freely into the cavities of the head
The quantity of sound is controlled by the breath
In diminishing the tone the opening of the throat remains the same
Only the quantity of breath given forth is diminished That is done by
the diaphragm muscles
Filare la voce to spin the voice from a tiny little thread into a
breadth of sound and then diminish again is one of the most beautiful
effects in singing
It is accomplished by the control of the breath and its perfect
accomplishment means the complete mastery of the greatest difficulty in
learning to sing
I think one of the best exercises for learning to control the voice by
first getting control of the breath is to stand erect in a
wellventilated room or out of doors and slowly snuff in air through the
nostrils inhaling in little puffs as if you were smelling something
Take just a little bit of air at a time and feel as if you were filling
the very bottom of your lungs and also the back of your lungs
When you have the sensation of being full up to the neck retain the air
for a few seconds and then very slowly send it out in little puffs
again
This is a splendid exercise but I want to warn you not to practice any
breathing exercise to such an extent that you make your heart beat fast
or feel like strangling
Overexercising the lungs is as bad as not exercising them enough and
the results are often harmful
Like everything else in singing you want to learn this gradually Never
neglect it because it is the very foundation of your art But dont try
to develop a diaphragm expansion of five inches in two weeks
Indeed it is not the expansion that you are working for
I have noticed this one peculiarity about young singersif they have an
enormous development of the diaphragm they think they should be able to
sing no matter what happens A girl came to see me once whose figure
was really entirely out of proportion the lower part of the lungs
having been pressed out quite beyond even artistic lines
You see madam she exclaimed I have studied breathing Why I have
such a strong diaphragm I can move the piano with it And she did go
right up to my piano and pushing on this strong diaphragm of hers
moved the piano a fraction of an inch from its place
I was quite aghast I had never met such an athletic singer When I
asked her to let me hear her voice however a tiny stream of contralto
sound issued from those powerful lungs
She had developed her breathing capacity but when she sang she held
her breath back
I have noticed that a great many people do this and it is one of the
things that must be overcome in the very beginning of the study of
singing
Certain young singers take in an enormous breath stiffening every
muscle in order to hold the air thus depriving their muscles of all
elasticity
They will then shut off the throat and let only the smallest fraction of
air escape just enough to make a sound Too much inbreathing and too
violent an effort at inhaling will not help the singer at all
People have said that they cannot see when I breathe Well they
certainly cannot say that I am ever short of breath even if I do try to
breathe invisibly When I breathe I scarcely draw my diaphragm in at
all but I feel the air fill my lungs and I feel my upper ribs expand
In singing I always feel as if I were forcing my breath against my
chest and just as in the exercises according to Delsarte you will find
the chest leads in all physical movements so in singing you should feel
this firm support of the chest of the highest as well as the lowest
notes
I have seen pupils trying to master the art of breathing holding
themselves as rigidly as drum majors
Now this rigidity of the spinal column will in no way help you in the
emission of tone nor will it increase the breath control In fact I
dont think it would even help you to stand up straight although it
would certainly give one a stiff appearance and one far removed from
grace
A singer should stand freely and easily and should feel as if the chest
were leading but should not feel constrained or stiff in any part of
the ribs or lungs
From the minute the singer starts to emit a tone the supply of breath
must be emitted steadily from the chamber of air in the lungs It must
never be held back once
The immediate pressure of the air should be felt more against the chest
I know of a great many singers who when they come to very difficult
passages put their hands on their chests focusing their attention on
this one part of the mechanism of singing
The audience of course thinks the prima donnas hand is raised to her
heart when as a matter of fact the prima donna with a difficult bit
of singing before her is thinking of her technique and the foundation
of that techniquebreath control
This feeling of singing against the chest with the weight of air
pressing up against it is known as breath support and in Italian we
have even a better word apoggio which is breath prop The diaphragm
in English may be called the bellows of the lungs but the apoggio is
the deep breath regulated by the diaphragm
The attack of the sound must come from the apoggio or breath prop In
attacking the very highest notes it is essential and no singer can
really get the high notes or vocal flexibility or strength of tone
without the attack coming from this seat of respiration
In practicing the trill or staccato tones the pressure of the breath
must be felt even before the sound is heard The beautiful clear
belllike tones that die away into a soft piano are tones struck on the
apoggio and controlled by the steady soft pressure of the breath emitted
through a perfectly open throat over a low tongue and resounding in the
cavities of the mouth or head
Never for a moment sing without this apoggio this breath prop Its
development and its constant use mean the restoration of sick or
fatigued voices and the prolonging of all ones vocal powers into what
is wrongly called old age
The Mastery of the Tongue
The tongue is a veritable stumbling block in the path of the singer The
tongue is an enormous muscle compared with the other parts of the throat
and mouth and its roots particularly can by a slight movement block the
passage of the throat pressing against the larynx This accounts for
much of the pinched singing we hear
When the tongue forms a mountain in the back part of the mouth the
singer produces what you call in English slang a hot potato tonethat
is to say a tone that sounds as if it were having much difficulty to
get through the mouth In very fact it is having this difficulty for
it has to pass over the back of the tongue
The wouldbe singer has to learn to control the tongue muscles and
above all things to learn to relax the tongue and to govern it at will
so that it never stiffens and forms that hard lump which can be plainly
felt immediately beneath the chin under the jaw
It requires a great deal of practice to gain control of the tongue and
there are many different exercises which purport to be beneficial in
gaining complete mastery over it One for instance is to throw the
tongue out as far forward as possible without stiffening it and then
draw it back slowly This can be done in front of a mirror by trying to
throw the tongue not only from the tip but from the root keeping the
sides of the tongue broad Another way is to catch hold of the two sides
of the tongue with the fingers and pull it out gently
For my part I scarcely approve of these mechanical ways of gaining
control of the tongue except in cases where the singer is phlegmatic of
temperament and cannot be made to feel the various sensations of stiff
tongue or tongue drawn far back in other ways Ordinarily I think they
make the singer conscious nervous and more likely to stiffen the tongue
in a wild desire to relax it and keep it flat
These exercises however combined with exercises in diction help to
make the tongue elastic and the more elastic and quick this muscle
becomes the clearer will be the singers diction and the more flexible
will be her voice
The correct position of the tongue is raised from the back lying flat
in the mouth the flattened tip beneath the front teeth with the sides
slightly raised so as to form a slight furrow in it When the tongue is
lying too low a lump under the chin beneath the jaw will form in singing
and the tight muscles can be easily felt
When the jaw is perfectly relaxed and the tongue lies flat in the mouth
there will be a slight hollow under the chin and no stiffness in the
muscles
The tip of the tongue of course is employed in the pronunciation of the
consonants and must be so agile that the minute it has finished its work
it at once resumes the correct position
In ascending the scale the furrow in the tongue increases as we come to
the higher notes It is here that the back of the palate begins to draw
up in order to add to the resonance of the head notes giving the
cavities of the head free play
You can easily see your back palate working by opening your mouth wide
and giving yourself the sensation of one about to sneeze You will see
far back in the throat way behind the nose a soft spot that will draw
up of itself as the sneeze becomes more imminent That little point is
the soft palate It must be drawn up for the high notes in order to get
the head resonance As a singer advances in her art she can do this at
will
The adjustment of throat tongue and palate all working together will
daily respond more easily to her demands However she should be able
consciously to control each part by itself
The conscious direction of the voice and command of the throat are
necessary Frequently in opera the singer sitting or lying in some
uncomfortable position which is not naturally convenient for producing
the voice will consciously direct her notes into the head cavities by
opening up the throat and lifting the soft palate For instance in the
role of Violetta the music of the last act is sung lying down In order
to get proper resonance to some of the high notes I have to start them
in the head cavity by means of course of the apoggio or breath prop
without which the note would be thin and would have no body to it
The sensation that I have is of a slight pressure of breath striking
almost into a direct line into the cavity behind the forehead over the
eyes without any obstruction or feeling in the throat at all
This is the correct attack for the head tone or a tone taken in the
upper register Before I explain the registers to you I must tell you
one of the funniest compliments I ever received A very flattering
person was comparing my voice to that of another high soprano whom I
very much admire
Her voice is beautiful particularly in the upper register I insisted
when the other lady was being criticized
Ah madame responded the flattering critic but your registers give
out so much more warmth
I think this joke is too good to lose also the criticism while unjust
to the other singer is interesting to the student because in the high
register which includes in some voices all the notes above middle C
the notes are thin and cold unless supported by the apoggio the breath
prop of which I have told you so much People ask whether there are
such things as vocal registers Certainly there are There are three
always and sometimes four in very high voices The ordinary registers
are the low the middle the high voice or head voice and sometimes
the second high voice which has been called the flagellant voice
A vocal register is a series of tones which are produced by a certain
position of the larynx tongue and palate In the womans voice the
middle register takes in the notes from E on the first line of the staff
about to middle C The head voice begins at middle C and runs up
sometimes to the end of the voice sometimes to B flat or C where it
joins the second head register which I have heard ascend into a whistle
in phenomenal voices cultivated only in this register and useless for
vocal work
Though the registers exist and the tones in middle below and above are
not produced in the same manner the voice should be so equalized that
the change in registers cannot be heard And a tone sung with a head
voice and in the low voice should have the same degree of quality
resonance and power
As the voice ascends in the scale each note is different and as one
goes on up the positions of the organ of the throat cannot remain the
same for several different tones But there should never be an abrupt
change either audible to the audience or felt in the singers throat
Every tone must be imperceptibly prepared and upon the elasticity of
the vocal organs depends the smoothness of the tone production
Adjusting the vocal apparatus to the high register should be both
imperceptible and mechanical whenever a high note has to be sung
In the high register the head voice or voice which vibrates in the head
cavities should be used chiefly The middle register requires palatal
resonance and the first notes of the head register and the last ones of
the middle require a judicious blending of both The middle register can
be dragged up to the high notes but always at the cost first of the
beauty of the voice and then of the voice itself for no organ can stand
being used wrongly for a long time
This is only one of the reasons that so many fine big voices go to
pieces long before they should
In an excess of enthusiasm the young singer attempts to develop the high
notes and make them soundin her own ears at all eventsas big as the
middle voice The pure head tone sounds small and feeble to the singer
herself and she would rather use the chest quality but the head tone
has the piercing penetrating quality which makes it tell in a big
hall while the middle register unless used in its right place makes
the voice muffled heavy and lacking in vibrancy Though to the singer
the tone may seem immense in reality it lacks resonance
A singer must never cease listening to herself intelligently and never
neglect cultivating the head tone or overtone of the voice which is
its salvation for it means vibrancy carrying power and youth to a
voice Without it the finest voice soon becomes worn and off pitch Used
judiciously it will preserve a voice into old age
Tone Emission and Attack
In my first talk I said a few words but not half enough on the subject
of breath control
My second talk was the physiological aspect of the throat head and
tongue for it is necessary to become thoroughly acquainted with the
mechanism with which you are to work before you can really sing Today
Im going to take up the subject of tone emission and the attack
A great many singers suffer from the defect called throatiness of the
emissionthat is to say they attack or start the note in the throat
Sooner or later this attack will ruin the most beautiful voice As I
have said before the attack of the note must come from the apoggio or
breath prop But to have the attack pure and perfectly in tune you must
have the throat entirely open for it is useless to try to sing if the
throat is not sufficiently open to let the sound pass freely Throaty
tones or pinched tones are tones which are trying to force themselves
through a halfclosed throat blocked either by insufficient opening of
the larynx or by stoppage of the throat passage due to the root of the
tongue being forced down and back too hard or possibly to a low soft
palate
In order to have the throat perfectly open it is necessary to have the
jaw absolutely relaxed
I have found in studying different nationalities that it is fairly easy
for the French and Spanish people to learn this relaxation of jaw and
the opening of the throat but the Englishspeaking people generally
talk with the throat half shut and even talk through halfshut teeth
Sometime when you are talking rapidly suddenly put your hand up to
your jaw You will find that it is stiff that the muscles beneath it
tongue muscles are tight and hard that the jaw seldom goes down very
far in pronouncing any of the English words whereas in singing the jaw
should be absolutely relaxed going down and back just as far as it can
with ease
The jaw is attached to the skull right beneath the temples in front of
the ears By placing your two fingers there and dropping the jaw you
will find that a space between the skull and jaw grows as the jaw drops
In singing this space must be as wide as is possible for that indicates
that the jaw is dropped down giving its aid to the opening at the back
of the throat It will help the beginner sometimes to do simple relaxing
exercises feeling the jaw drop with the fingers It must drop down and
it is not necessary to open the mouth wide because the jaw is relaxed
to its utmost
However for a beginner it is as well to practice opening the mouth
wide being sure to lower the jaw at the back Do this many times a day
without emitting any sound merely to get the feeling of what an open
throat is really like You will presently begin to yawn after you have
done the exercise a couple of times In yawning or in starting to drink
a sip of water the throat is widely open and the sensation is a correct
one which the singer must study to reproduce
I have noticed a great many actors and actresses in America who speak
with jaws tightly closed or at least closed to such an extent that only
the smallest emission of breath is possible Such a voice production
will never allow the actor to express any varying degree of emotion and
will also completely eradicate any natural beauty of tone which the
voice may have However this is a fault which can easily be overcome by
practicing this daily relaxation of the jaw and always when singing
breathing as if the jaw hung perfectly loose or better still as if
you had none at all When you can see a vocalist pushing on the jaw you
can be perfectly certain that the tone she is emitting at that moment is
a forced note and that the whole vocal apparatus is being tortured to
create what is probably not a pleasant noise
Any kind of mental distress will cause the jaw to stiffen and will have
an immediate effect upon the voice This is one of the reasons why a
singer must learn to control her emotions and must not subject herself
to any harrowing experiences even such as watching a sensational
spectacle before she is going to sing Fear worry frightstage as
well as other kindsset the jaw So does too great a determination to
succeed A singers mind must control all of her feelings if it is going
to control her voice She must be able even to surmount a feeling of
illness or stage fright and to control her vocal apparatus as well as
her breath no matter what happens
The singer should feel as if her jaw were detached and falling away from
her face As one great singer expresses it You should have the jaw of
an imbecile when emitting a tone In fact you shouldnt know that you
have one Let us take the following passage from The Marriage of
Figaro by Mozart
Illustration Voiche sapete
This would make an excellent exercise for the jaw Sing only the vowels
dropping the jaw as each one is attackedo eh ah The o of course
is pronounced like the English o and the i in voi like e The e in che
is pronounced like the English a Sapete is pronounced sahpata You now
have the vowels o ee a ah a Open the throat wide drop the jaw and
pronounce the tones on a note in the easiest part of your voice
Do not attack a note at the same time that you are inhaling That is too
soon Take the breath through the nose of course and give it an
instant to settle before attacking the sound In this way you will avoid
the stroke of the glottis which is caused by the sudden and uncontrolled
emission of the accumulated breath In attacking a note the breath must
be directed to the focusing point on the palate which lies just at the
critical spot different for every tone In attacking a note however
there must be no pressure on this place because if there is the
overtones will be unable to soar and sound with the tone
From the moment the note is attacked the breath must flow out with it
It is a good idea to feel at first as if one were puffing out the
breath This is particularly good for the high notes on which a special
stress must be laid always to attack with the breath and not to press or
push with the throat As long as the tone lasts the gentle but
uninterrupted outpouring of the breath must continue behind it This
breath pressure insures the strength and while holding the note to the
focusing point on the palate insures its pitch In a general way it can
be said that the medium tones of the voice have their focusing point in
the middle part of the palate the lower tones coming nearer to the
teeth to be centralized and the high notes giving the sensation of
finding their focusing point in the high arch at the back of the mouth
and going out as it were through the crown of the head
The resonance in the head cavities is soon perceived by those who are
beginning to sing Sometimes in producing their first high notes young
people become nervous and irritated when singing high tones at the
curious buzzing in the head and ears After a short time however this
sensation is no longer an irritation and the singer can gauge in a way
where his tones are placed by getting a mental idea of where the
resonance to each particular tone should be
High notes with plenty of head vibration can only be obtained when the
head is clear and the nasal cavities unobstructed by mucous membrane or
by any of the depression which comes from physical or mental cause The
best way to lose such depression is to practice Practicing the long
scale being careful to use the different registers as described later
will almost invariably even out the voice and clear out the head if
continued long enough and will enable the singer to overcome nervous or
mental depression as well
The different sensations in producing the tone vary according to the
