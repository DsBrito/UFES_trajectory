INTRODUCTION
BRANTWOOD 14th March 1874
Yesterday evening I was looking over the first book in which I studied
BotanyCurtiss Magazine published in 1795 at No 3 St Georges
Crescent Blackfriars Road and sold by the principal booksellers in Great
Britain and Ireland Its plates are excellent so that I am always glad to
find in it the picture of a flower I know And I came yesterday upon what I
suppose to be a variety of a favourite flower of mine called in Curtis
the St Brunos Lily
I am obliged to say what I suppose to be a variety because my pet lily
is branched1 while this is drawn as unbranched and especially stated to
be so And the page of text in which this statement is made is so
characteristic of botanical books and botanical science not to say all
science as hitherto taught for the blessing of mankind 2 and of the
difficulties thereby accompanying its communication that I extract the
page entire printing it opposite as nearly as possible in facsimile
Now you observe in this instructive page that you have in the first
place nine names given you for one flower and that among these nine
names you are not even at liberty to make your choice because the united
authority of Haller and Miller may be considered as an accurate balance to
the single authority of Linnus and you ought therefore for the present to
remain yourself balanced between the sides You may be farther
embarrassed by finding that the Anthericum of Savoy is only described as
growing in Switzerland And farther still by finding that Mr Miller
describes two varieties of it which differ only in size while you are
left to conjecture whether the one here figured is the larger or smaller
and how great the difference is
Farther If you wish to know anything of the habits of the plant as well
as its nine names you are informed that it grows both at the bottoms of
the mountains and the tops and that with us it flowers in May and
Junebut you are not told when in its native country
The four lines of the last clause but one may indeed be useful to
gardeners butalthough I know my good father and mother did the best they
could for me in buying this beautiful book and though the admirable plates
of it did their work and taught me much I cannot wonder that neither my
infantine nor boyish mind was irresistibly attracted by the text of which
this page is one of the most favourable specimens nor in consequence
that my botanical studies werewhen I had attained the age of fiftyno
farther advanced than the reader will find them in the opening chapter of
this book

Botanists are divided in their opinions respecting the genus of this
plant LINNUS considers it as an Anthericum HALLER and MILLER make
it an Hemerocallis
It is a native of Switzerland where HALLER informs us it grows
abundantly in the Alpine meadows and even on the summits of the
mountains with us it flowers in May and June
It is a plant of great elegance producing on an unbranched stem about
a foot and a half high numerous flowers of a delicate white colour
much smaller but resembling in form those of the common white lily
possessing a considerable degree of fragrance their beauty is
heightened by the rich orange colour of their anther unfortunately
they are but of short duration
MILLER describes two varieties of it differing merely in size
A loamy soil a situation moderately moist with an eastern or western
exposure suits this plant best so situated it will increase by its
roots though not very fast and by parting of these in the autumn it
is usually propagated
PARKINSON describes and figures it in his Parad Terrest observing
that divers allured by the beauty of its flowers had brought it into
these parts

Which said book was therefore undertaken to put if it might be some
elements of the science of botany into a form more tenable by ordinary
human and childish faculties orfor I can scarcely say I have yet any
tenure of it myselfto make the paths of approach to it more pleasant In
fact I only know of it the pleasant distant effects which it bears to
simple eyes and some pretty mists and mysteries which I invite my young
readers to pierce as they may for themselvesmy power of guiding them
being only for a little way
Pretty mysteries I say as opposed to the vulgar and ugly mysteries of the
socalled science of botanyexemplified sufficiently in this chosen page
Respecting which please observe fartherNobodyI can say this very
boldlyloves Latin more dearly than I but precisely because I do love it
as well as for other reasons I have always insisted that books whether
scientific or not ought to be written either in Latin or English and not
in a doggish mixture of the refuse of both
Linnus wrote a noble book of universal Natural History in Latin It is one
of the permanent classical treasures of the world And if any scientific
man thinks his labors are worth the worlds attention let him also write
5 what he has to say in Latin finishedly and exquisitely if it take him
a month to a page2
But ifwhich unless he be one chosen of millions is assuredly the
facthis lucubrations are only of local and temporary consequence let him
write as clearly as he can in his native language
This book accordingly I have written in English not by the way that I
could have written it in anything elseso there are small thanks to me
and one of its purposes is to interpret for young English readers the
necessary European Latin or Greek names of flowers and to make them vivid
and vital to their understandings But two great difficulties occur in
doing this The first that there are generally from three or four up to
two dozen Latin names current for every flower and every new botanist
thinks his eminence only to be properly asserted by adding another
The second and a much more serious one is of the Devils own
contrivingand remember I am always quite serious when I speak of the
Devilnamely that the most current and authoritative names are apt to
be founded on some unclean or debasing association so that to interpret
them is to defile the readers mind I will give no instance too many will
at once occur to any 6 learned reader and the unlearned I need not vex
with so much as one but in such cases since I could only take refuge in
the untranslated word by leaving other Greek or Latin words also
untranslated and the nomenclature still entirely senselessand I do not
choose to do thisthere is only one other course open to me namely to
substitute boldly to my own pupils other generic names for the plants
thus faultfully hitherto titled
As I do not do this for my own pride but honestly for my readers service
I neither question nor care how far the emendations I propose may be now or
hereafter adopted I shall not even name the cases in which they have been
made for the serious reason above specified but even shall mask those
which there was real occasion to alter by sometimes giving new names in
cases where there was no necessity of such kind Doubtless I shall be
accused of doing myself what I violently blame in others I do so but with
a different motiveof which let the reader judge as he is disposed The
practical result will be that the children who learn botany on the system
adopted in this book will know the useful and beautiful names of plants
hitherto given in all languages the useless and ugly ones they will not
know And they will have to learn one Latin name for each plant which
when differing from the common one I trust may yet by some scientific
persons be accepted and with ultimate advantage
The learning of the one Latin nameas for instance Gramen striatumI
hope will be accurately enforced 7 alwaysbut not less carefully the
learning of the pretty English oneLadielace Grasswith due observance
that Ladies laces hath leaves like unto Millet in fashion with many
white vaines or ribs and silver strakes running along through the middest
of the leaves fashioning the same like to laces of white and green silk
very beautiful and faire to behold
I have said elsewhere and can scarcely repeat too often that a day will
come when men of science will think their names disgraced instead of
honoured by being used to barbarise nomenclature I hope therefore that my
own name may be kept well out of the way but having been privileged to
found the School of Art in the University of Oxford I think that I am
justified in requesting any scientific writers who may look kindly upon
this book to add such of the names suggested in it as they think deserving
of acceptance to their own lists of synonyms under the head of Schol
Art Oxon
The difficulties thrown in the way of any quiet private student by existing
nomenclature may be best illustrated by my simply stating what happens to
myself in endeavouring to use the page above facsimiled Not knowing how
far St Brunos Lily might be connected with my own pet one and not having
any sufficient book on Swiss botany I take down Loudons Encyclopdia of
Plants a most useful book as far as any book in the present state of the
science can be useful and find under the head of Anthericum the Savoy
Lily indeed but only the 8 following general information809
Anthericum A name applied by the Greeks to the stem of the asphodel and
not misapplied to this set of plants which in some sort resemble the
asphodel Plants with fleshy leaves and spikes of bright yellow flowers
easily cultivated if kept dry
Hunting further I find again my Savoy lily called a spiderplant under
the article Hemerocallis and the only information which the book gives me
under Hemerocallis is that it means beautiful day lily and then This
is an ornamental genus of the easiest culture The species are remarkable
among border flowers for their fine orange yellow or blue flowers
The Hemerocallis coerulea has been considered a distinct genus by Mr
Salisbury and called Saussurea As I correct this sheet for press
however I find that the Hemerocallis is now to be called Funkia in
honour of Mr Funk a Prussian apothecary
All this while meantime I have a suspicion that my pet Savoy Lily is not
in existing classification an Anthericum nor a Hemerocallis but a
Lilium It is in fact simply a Turks cap which doesnt curl up But on
trying Lilium in Loudon I find no mention whatever of any wild branched
white lily
I then try the next word in my specimen page of Curtis but there is no
Phalangium at all in Loudons index And now I have neither time nor mind
for more search but will give in due place such account as I can 9 of
my own dwarf branched lily which I shall call St Brunos as well as this
Liliastrumno offence to the saint I hope For it grows very gloriously
on the limestones of Savoy presumably therefore at the Grande
Chartreuse though I did not notice it there and made a very unmonkish use
of it when I gathered it lastThere was a pretty young English lady at
the tabledhote in the Hotel du Mont Blanc at St Martins3 and I
wanted to get speech of her and didnt know how So all I could think of
was to go halfway up the Aiguille de Varens to gather St Brunos lilies
and I made a great cluster of them and put wild roses all around them as I
came down I never saw anything so lovely and I thought to present this to
her before dinnerbut when I got down she had gone away to Chamouni My
Fors always treated me like that in affairs of the heart
I had begun my studies of Alpine botany just eighteen years before in
1842 by making a careful drawing of woodsorrel at Chamouni and bitterly
sorry I am now that the work was interrupted For I drew then very
delicately and should have made a pretty book if I could have got peace
Even yet I can manage my point a little and would far rather be making
outlines of flowers than writing and I meant to have drawn every English
and Scottish wild flower like this cluster of bog heather
opposite4back and profile and front But Blackwoods 10
Magazine with its insults to Turner dragged me into controversy and I
have not had properly speaking a days peace since so that in 1868 my
botanical studies were advanced only as far as the reader will see in next
chapter and now in 1874 must end altogether I suppose heavier thoughts
and work coming fast on me So that finding among my notebooks two or
three full of broken materials for the proposed work on flowers and
thinking they may be useful even as fragments I am going to publish them
in their present stateonly let the reader note that while my other books
endeavour and claim so far as they reach to give trustworthy knowledge
of their subjects this one only shows how such knowledge may be obtained
and it is little more than a history of efforts and plansbut of both I
believe made in right methods
One part of the book however will I think be found of permanent value
Mr Burgess has engraved on wood in reduced size with consummate skill
some of the excellent old drawings in the Flora Danica and has
interpreted and facsimiled some of his own and my drawings from nature
with a vigour and precision unsurpassed in woodcut illustration which
render these outlines the best exercises in black and white I have yet been
able to 11 prepare for my drawing pupils The larger engravings by Mr
Allen may also be used with advantage as copies for drawings with pen or
sepia
ROME 10th May my fathers birthday
I found the loveliest blue asphodel I ever saw in my life yesterday in
the fields beyond Monte Marioa spire two feet high of more than two
hundred stars the stalks of them all deep blue as well as the flowers
Heaven send all honest people the gathering of the like in Elysian fields
some day

CHAPTER I
MOSS
DENMARK HILL 3rd November 1868
1 It is mortifying enough to writebut I think thus much ought to be
writtenconcerning myself as the author of Modern Painters In three
months I shall be fifty years old and I dont at this hourten oclock in
the morning of the two hundred and sixtyeighth day of my fortyninth
yearknow what moss is
There is nothing I have more intended to knowsome day or other But the
moss would always be there and then it was so beautiful and so
difficult to examine that one could only do it in some quite separated
time of happy leisurewhich came not I never was like to have less
leisure than now but I will know what moss is if possible forthwith
2 To that end I read preparatorily yesterday what account I could find
of it in all the botanical books in the house Out of them all I get this
general notion of a mossthat it has a fine fibrous roota stem
surrounded with spirally set leavesand produces its fruit in a small
case under a cap I fasten especially however on a 13 sentence of
Louis Figuiers about the particular species Hypnum
These mosses which often form little islets of verdure at the feet of
poplars and willows are robust vegetable organisms which do not
decay5
3 Qui ne pourrissent point What do they do with themselves thenit
immediately occurs to me to ask And secondlyIf this immortality
belongs to the Hypnum only
It certainly does not by any means but however modified or limited this
immortality is the first thing we ought to take note of in the mosses They
are in some degree what the everlasting is in flowers Those minute
green leaves of theirs do not decay nor fall
But how do they die or how stop growing thenit is the first thing I
want to know about them And from all the books in the house I cant as
yet find out this Meanwhile I will look at the leaves themselves
4 Going out to the garden I bring in a bit of old brick emerald green on
its rugged surface6 and a thick piece of mossy turf
First for the old brick To think of the quantity of pleasure one has had
in ones life from that emerald green velvetand yet that for the first
time today I am verily going to look at it Doing so through a pocket
14 lens of no great power I find the velvet to be composed of small
starlike groups of smooth strong oval leavesintensely green and much
like the young leaves of any other plant except in thisthey all have a
long brown spike like a sting at their ends
Illustration FIG 1
5 Fastening on that I take the Flora Danica7 and look through its
plates of mosses for their leaves only and I find first that this
spike or strong central rib is characteristicsecondly that the said
leaves are apt to be not only spiked but serrated and otherwise
angrylooking at the pointsthirdly that they have a tendency to fold
together in the centre Fig 18 and at last after an hours work at
them it strikes me suddenly that they are more like pineapple leaves than
anything else
And it occurs to me very unpleasantly at the same time that I dont know
what a pineapple is
Stopping to ascertain that I am told that a pineapple belongs to the
Bromeliacecant stop to find out what that meansnay that of these
plants the pineapple is the representative Loudon their habit is
acid their leaves rigid and toothed with spines their 15 bracteas
often coloured with scarlet and their flowers either white or bluewhat
are their flowers like But the two sentences that most interest me are
that in the damp forests of Carolina the Tillandsia which is an
epiphyte ie a plant growing on other plants forms dense festoons
among the branches of the trees vegetating among the black mould that
collects upon the bark of trees in hot damp countries other species are
inhabitants of deep and gloomy forests and others form with their spring
leaves an impenetrable herbage in the Pampas of Brazil So they really
seem to be a kind of moss on a vast scale
6 Next I find in Gray9 Bromeliace andthe very thing I
wantTillandsia the black moss or long moss which like most
Bromelias grows on the branches of trees So the pineapple is really a
moss only it is a moss that flowers but imperfectly The fine fruit is
caused by the consolidation of the imperfect flowers I wish we could
consolidate some imperfect English mossflowers into little pineapples
thenthough they were only as big as filberts But we cannot follow that
farther now nor consider when a flower is perfect and when it is not or
we should get into morals and I dont know where else we will go back to
the moss I have gathered for I begin to see my way a little to
understanding it
16
7 The second piece I have on the table is a clusteran inch or two
deepof the moss that grows everywhere and that the birds use for
nestbuilding and we for packing and the like It is dry since
yesterday and its fibres define themselves against the dark ground in warm
green touched with a glittering light Note that burnished lustre of the
minute leaves they are necessarily always relieved against dark hollows
and this lustre makes them much clearer and brighter than if they were of
dead green In that lustreand it is characteristic of themthey differ
wholly from the dead aloelike texture of the pineapple leaf and remind
me as I look at them closely a little of some conditions of chaff as on
heads of wheat after being threshed I will hunt down that clue presently
meantime there is something else to be noticed on the old brick
Illustration FIG 2
8 Out of its emerald green cushions of minute leaves there rise here and
there thin red threads each with a little brown cap or something like a
cap at the top of it These red threads shooting up out of the green
tufts are I believe the fructification of the moss fringing its surface
in the woods and on the rocks with the small forests of brown stems each
carrying its pointed cap or crestof infinitely varied mode as we shall
see presently and which is one of their most blessed functions carrying
high the dew in the morning every spear balancing its own crystal globe
9 And now with my own broken memories of moss 17 and this unbroken
though unfinished gift of the noble labour of other people the Flora
Danica I can generalize the idea of the precious little plant for myself
and for the reader
All mosses I believe with such exceptions and collateral groups as we
may afterwards discover but they are not many that is to say some
thousands of species are in their strength of existence composed of
fibres surrounded by clusters of dry spinous leaves set close to the
fibre they grow on Out of this leafy stern descends a fibrous root and
ascends in its season a capped seed
We must get this very clearly into our heads Fig 2 A is a little tuft
of a common wood moss of Norway10 in its fruit season of its real size
but at present I want to look at the central fibre and its leaves
accurately and understand that first
10 Pulling it to pieces we find it composed of seven little
companykeeping fibres each of which by itself appears as in Fig 2 B
but as in this its real size it 18 is too small not indeed for our
respect but for our comprehension we magnify it Fig 2 C and thereupon
perceive it to be indeed composed of a the small fibrous root which
sustains the plant b the leafsurrounded stem which is the actual
being and main creature moss and c the aspirant pillar and cap of
its fructification
11 But there is one minor division yet You see I have drawn the central
part of the moss plant b Fig 2 half in outline and half in black
and that similarly in the upper group which is too small to show the
real roots the base of the cluster is black And you remember I doubt
not how often in gathering what most invited gathering of deep green
starry perfectly soft and living woodmoss you found it fall asunder in
your hand into multitudes of separate threads each with its bright green
crest and long root of blackness
That blackness at the rootthough only so notable in this woodmoss and
collateral species is indeed a general character of the mosses with rare
exceptions It is their funeral blacknessthat I perceive is the way
the moss leaves die They do not fallthey do not visibly decay But they
decay invisibly in continual secession beneath the ascending crest
They rise to form that crest all green and bright and take the light and
air from those out of which they grewand those their ancestors darken
and die slowly and at last become a mass of mouldering ground In fact as
I perceive farther their final duty is so to die The main work of other
leaves is 19 in their lifebut these have to form the earth out of
which all other leaves are to grow Not to cover the rocks with golden
velvet only but to fill their crannies with the dark earth through which
nobler creatures shall one day seek their being
12 Grant but as many sorts of mind as moss Pope could not have known
the hundredth part of the number of sorts of moss there are and I
suppose he only chose the word because it was a monosyllable beginning with
m and the best English general expression for despised and minute
structures of plants But a fate rules the words of wise men which makes
their words truer and worth more than the men themselves know No other
plants have so endless variety on so similar a structure as the mosses and
none teach so well the humility of Death As for the death of our bodies
we have learned wisely or unwisely to look the fact of that in the face
But none of us I think yet care to look the fact of the death of our
minds in the face I do not mean death of our souls but of our mental
work So far as it is good art indeed and done in realistic form it
may perhaps not die but so far as it was only good thoughtgood for
its time and apparently a great achievement thereinthat good useful
thought may yet in the future become a foolish thought and then die quite
awayit and the memory of itwhen better thought and knowledge come
But the better thought could not have come if the weaker thought had not
come first and died in sustaining the 20 better If we think honestly
our thoughts will not only live usefully but even perish usefullylike
the mossand become dark not without due service But if we think
dishonestly or malignantly our thoughts will die like evil
fungidripping corrupt dew
13 But farther If you have walked moorlands enough to know the look of
them you know well those flat spaces or causeways of bright green or
golden ground between the heathy rock masses which signify winding pools
and inlets of stagnant water caught among the rockspools which the deep
moss that covers themblanched not black at the rootis slowly
filling and making firm whence generally the unsafe ground in the moorland
gets known by being mossy instead of heathy and is at last called by its
riders briefly the Moss and as it is mainly at these same mossy places
that the riding is difficult and brings out the gifts of horse and rider
and discomfits all followers not similarly gifted the skilled crosser of
them got his name naturally of mossrider or mosstrooper In which
manner the moss of Norway and Scotland has been a taskmaster and Maker of
Soldiers as yet the strongest known among natural powers The lightning
may kill a man or cast down a tower but these little tender leaves of
mossthey and their progenitorshave trained the Northern Armies
14 So much for the human meaning of that decay of the leaves Now to go
back to the little creatures themselves It seems that the upper part of
the moss fibre is 21 especially undecaying among leaves and the lower
part especially decaying That in fact a plant of mossfibre is a kind
of persistent state of what is in other plants annual Watch the years
growth of any luxuriant flower First it comes out of the ground all fresh
and bright then as the higher leaves and branches shoot up those first
leaves near the ground get brown sickly earthyremain for ever degraded
in the dust and under the dashed slime in rain staining and grieving
and loading them with obloquy of envious earth halfkilling themonly
life enough left in them to hold on the stem and to be guardians of the
rest of the plant from all they sufferwhile above them the happier
leaves for whom they are thus oppressed bend freely to the sunshine and
drink the rain pure
The moss strengthens on a diminished scale intensifies and makes
perpetual these two statesbright leaves above that never wither leaves
beneath that exist only to wither
15 I have hitherto spoken only of the fading moss as it is needed for
change into earth But I am not sure whether a yet more important office
in its days of age be not its use as a colour
We are all thankful enoughas far as we ever are sofor green moss and
yellow moss But we are never enough grateful for black moss The golden
would be nothing without it nor even the grey
It is true that there are black lichens enough and 22 brown ones
nevertheless the chief use of lichens is for silver and gold colour on
rocks and it is the dead moss which gives the leopardlike touches of
black And yet here againas to a thing I have been looking at and
painting all my lifeI am brought to pause the moment I think of it
carefully The black moss which gives the precious Velasquez touches lies
much of it flat on the rocks radiating from its centrespowdering in the
fingers if one breaks it off like dry tea Is it a black speciesor a
blackparched state of other species perishing for the sake of Velasquez
effects instead of accumulation of earth and if so does it die of
drought accidentally or in a sere old age naturally and how is it
related to the rich green bosses that grow in deep velvet And there again
is another matter not clear to me One calls them velvet because they are
all brought to an even surface at the top Our own velvet is reduced to
such trimness by cutting But how is the moss trimmed By what scissors
Carefullest Elizabethan gardener never shaped his yew hedge more daintily
than the moss fairies smooth these soft rounded surfaces of green and gold
And just fancy the difference if they were ragged If the fibres had every
one of them leave to grow at their own sweet will and to be long or short
as they liked or worse still urged by fairy prizes into laboriously and
agonizingly trying which could grow longest Fancy the surface of a spot of
competitive moss
16 But how is it that they are subdued into that 23 spherical obedience
like a crystal of wavellite11 Strangethat the vegetable creatures
growing so fondly on rocks should form themselves in that minerallike
manner It is true that the tops of all wellgrown trees are rounded on a
large scale as equally but that is because they grow from a central stem
while these mossy mounds are made out of independent filaments each
growing to exactly his proper height in the sphereshort ones outside
long in the middle Stop though is that so I am not even sure of that
perhaps they are built over a little dome of decayed moss below12 I must
find out how every 24 filament grows separatelyfrom root to cap
through the spirally set leaves And meanwhile I dont know very clearly so
much as what a root isor what a leaf is Before puzzling myself any
farther in examination either of moss or any other grander vegetable I had
better define these primal forms of all vegetation as well as I canor
rather begin the definition of them for future completion and correction
For as my reader must already sufficiently perceive this book is
literally to be one of studiesnot of statements Some one said of me
once very shrewdly When he wants to work out a subject he writes a book
on it That is a very true saying in the mainI work down or up to my
mark and let the reader see process and progress not caring to conceal
them But this book will be nothing but process I dont mean to assert
anything positively in it from the first page to the last Whatever I say
is to be understood only as a conditional statementliable to and
inviting correction And this the more because as on the whole I am at
war with the botanists I cant ask them to help me and then 25 call
them names afterwards I hope only for a contemptuous heaping of coals on
my head by correction of my errors from themin some cases my scientific
friends will I know give me forgiving aidbut for many reasons I am
forced first to print the imperfect statement as I can independently shape
it for if once I asked for or received help every thought would be
