THE AGAPEMONE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
As it is not generally known that the Agapemone had a prototype in the
celebrated Family of Love some account of this wicked sect may not at
this moment be without interest to your readers
Henry Nicholas a Westphalian born at Munster but who had lived a
great while at Amsterdam and some time likewise at Embden was the
father of this family He appeared upon the stage about the year 1540
styled himself the deified man boasted of great matters and seemed
to exalt himself above the condition of a human creature He was as he
pretended greater than Moses and Christ because Moses had taught
mankind to hope Christ to believe but he to love which last
being of more worth than both the former he was consequently greater
than both those prophetsSee Brandts Hist of the Reform c in
the Low Countries vol i p 105 ed 1720
According to some writers however the sect was not founded by Henry
Nicholas but by David George an Anabaptist enthusiast of Delft who died
in 1556 and indeed there is some reason to believe that the Family of
Love grew out of the heresies of the said George with whom Nicholas had
been on friendly terms
Not content says Fuller speaking of Nicholas to confine his
errors to his own country over he comes into England and in the
latter end of the reign of Edward the Sixth joyned himself to the
Dutch congregation in London where he seduced a number of artificers
and silly womenChurch Hist p 112 ed 1655
On the 12th of June 1575 according to the historian Hollinshed
Stood at Paules Crosse five persons Englishmen of the sect termed
the Familie of Love who there confessed themselves utterlie to detest
as well the author of that sect H N as all his damnable errors and
heresies
A curious little volume on the history and doctrines of this sect appeared
in the year 1572 from the pen of John Rogers entitled The Displaying of
an horrible Secte of grosse and wicked Heretiques naming themselves the
Family of Love with the Lives of their Authors and what Doctrine they
teach in Corners Imprinted at London for George Bishop 1579 12mo
Christopher Vittall a joiner of Southwark who had been infected with the
doctrine of Arius some twenty years before and whose credit was great
amongst the Family of Love was at this period actively engaged in
teaching their doctrines He travelled about the country to disseminate
them and was likewise author of a little book in reply to Rogers
Displaying of the sect printed in the same year
At the close of the year 1580 the sect was increasing so rapidly in
England that the government took active measures for its suppression and
the Queen issued a proclamation to search for the teachers or professors
of the foresaid damnable sect and to proceed severelie against them
50 This proclamation may be seen in Hollinshed and in Camdens
Annals1
After the death of Queen Elizabeth
The Family of Love or Lust rather according to Fuller presented
a tedious petition to King James so that it is questionable whether
his Majesty ever graced it with his perusall wherein they endeavoured
to cleare themselves from some misrepresentations and by fawning
expression to insinuate themselves into his Majestys good opinion
After printing the petition Fuller proceeds
I finde not what effect this their petition produced whether it was
slighted and the petitioners looked upon as inconsiderable or beheld
as a few frantick folk out of their wits which consideration alone
often melted their adversaries anger into pity unto them The main
design driven on in the petition is to separate themselves from the
Puritans as persons odious to King James that they might not fare
the worse for their vicinity unto them though these Familists could
not be so desirous to leave them as the others were glad to be left by
them For if their opinions were so senseless and the lives of these
Familists so sensuall as is reported no purity at all belonged unto
them
The Family of Love after being exposed and ridiculed both in prose and
rime finally gave up the ghost and was succeeded by another wicked
sect denominated the Ranters

PUNISHMENT OF DEATH BY BURNING
A woman was strangled and burnt for coining in front of the Debtors door
Newgate on the 10th of March 1789 I believe this to be the last instance
in which this old punishment was inflicted at least in the metropolis The
burning part of the ceremony was abolished by the 30 Geo III c 48 and
death by hanging made the penalty for women in cases of high or petty
treason E S S Ws informants are wrong in supposing that the criminals
were burnt whilst living The law indeed prescribed it but the practice
was more humane They were first strangled although it sometimes happened
that through the bungling of the executioner a criminal was actually
burnt alive as occurred in the celebrated case of Katherine Hayes
executed for the murder of her husband in 1726 The circumstances of this
case are so remarkable that having referred to it I am induced to
recapitulate the chief of them in the belief that they will interest your
readers Hayes who was possessed of some little property lodged with his
wife Katherine in Tyburn now Oxford Road Mrs Hayes prevailed upon two
men named Billings who lodged in the house and Wood a friend of Hayes
to assist her in murdering her husband To facilitate that object Hayes
was induced to drink the enormous quantity of seven bottles at that time
full quarts of Mountain wine besides other intoxicating drinks After
finishing the seventh bottle he fell on the floor but soon after arose and
threw himself on a bed There whilst in a state of stupefaction he was
despatched by Billings and Wood striking him on the head with a hatchet
The murderers then held council as to the best mode of concealing their
crime and it was determined that they should mutilate and dispose of the
body They cut off the head Mrs Hayes holding a pail to catch the blood
and she proposed that the head should be boiled until the flesh came from
the skull This advice was rejected on account of the time which the
process suggested would occupy and Billings and Wood carried the head in
the pail it was at night to the Horseferry at Westminster and there cast
it into the Thames On the following day the murderers separated the limbs
from the body and wrapping them together with the trunk in two blankets
carried them to Marylebone fields and placed them in a pond Hayes head
not having been carried away by the tide as the murderers expected it
would have been was found floating at the Horseferry in the morning The
attention of the authorities was drawn to the circumstance and the
magistrates being of opinion that a murder had been committed caused the
head to be washed and the hair combed out and then had it placed on a pole
and exposed to public view in St Margarets churchyard in the hope that
it might lead to the discovery of the suspected crime Great crowds of
persons of all ranks flocked to St Margarets churchyard to see the head
and amongst the rest a young man named Bennett who perceiving the likeness
to Hayes whom he knew immediately went to Mrs Hayes on the subject but
she assured him that her husband was alive and well which satisfied him A
journeyman tailor named Patrick also went to see the head and on his
return told his fellow workmen that it was Hayes These workmen who also
had known Hayes then went to look at the head and felt the same
conviction It happened that Billings worked at the same shop in which
these men were employed in Monmouth Street and when he came to work next
morning they told him of the circumstance Billings however lulled their
suspicious by declaring that he had left Mr Hayes at home that morning
After the head had been exhibited for four days in the churchyard the
magistrates caused it to be placed in spirits in a glass vessel and in
that state it continued to be exposed to public view Two friends of Hayes
named Ashley and Longmore who had seen the head without imagining that it
was his some time after called on Mrs Hayes on separate occasions to
inquire for her husband whose absence began to be noticed Ashley and
Longmore were mutual 51 friends and their suspicions being excited by
the contradictory statements which Mrs Hayes had given to them they went
to look again at the head when a minute examination satisfied them that it
had belonged to Hayes The apprehension of the murderers was the result On
the day they were brought up for examination the trunk and limbs of the
murdered man were found Wood and Billings confessed and pleaded guilty
Katherine Hayes put herself on her country was tried and convicted Wood
died in prison Billings was hanged in Marylebone fields near the pond in
which Hayess body had been concealed Katherine Hayes was executed at
Tyburn under circumstances of great horror for in consequence of the
fire reaching the executioners hands he left his hold of the rope with
which he ought to have strangled the criminal before he had executed that
part of his duty and the result was that Katherine Hayes was burnt alive
The wretched woman was seen in the midst of flames pushing the blazing
faggots from her whilst she yelled in agony Fresh faggots were piled
around her but a considerable time elapsed before her torments ended She
suffered on the 3rd of November 1726 This tragedy forms the subject of a
comic ballad which is attributed to Swift

The communication of E S S W Vol ii p 6 which is as interesting
as it is shocking induces me to send you a short extract from Harrisons
Derby and Nottingham Journal or Midland Advertiser The number of this
journal which is dated Thursday September 23 1779 contains as follows
On Saturday two prisoners were capitally convicted at the Old Bailey
of high treason viz Isabella Condon for coining shillings in
ColdBathFields and John Field for coining shillings in Nags Head
Yard Bishopsgate Street They will receive sentence to be drawn on a
hurdle to the place of execution the woman to be burnt and the man
to be hanged
I presume that the sentence which the woman underwent was not executed The
barbarous fulfilment of such a law was it may be hoped already obsolete
The motives however upon which this law was grounded is worth noting
In treason of every kind says Blackstone the punishment of women
is the same and different from that of men For as the decency due
to the sex forbids the exposing and publicly mangling their bodies
their sentence which is to the full as terrible to sensation as the
other is to be drawn to the gallows and there to be burned alive
But says the footnote by the statute 30 Geo III c 48 women
convicted in all cases of treason shall receive judgment to be drawn
to the place of execution and there to be hanged by the neck till
dead
The law therefore under which a woman could be put to death by burning
was repealed in 1790
Blackstone elsewhere says
The humanity of the English nation has authorized by a tacit consent
an almost general mitigation of such part of those judgments as savours
of torture and cruelty a sledge or hurdle being usually allowed to
such traitors as are condemned to be drawn and there being very few
instances and those accidental or by negligence of any persons being
embowelled or burned till previously deprived of sensation by
strangling
This corroborates the conclusion of E S S W that the woman he
describes was strangled at the stake to which her neck was bound
I wish to suggest to any of your legal or other wellinformed
correspondents who will have the kindness to take a little trouble for the
benefit of your general readers that an instructive and interesting
communication might be made by noting down the periods at which the various
more revolting punishments under the English law were repealed or fell
into disuse For instance when torture such as the rack was last
applied when embowelling alive and quartering ceased to be practised and
whose was the last head that fell under the axes bloody stroke A word
also on the use of the pillory duckingstool stocks c would interest
Any illustrations of the modification of our penal code would throw
valuable light on the philosophy and improvement of the national character
And I believe it would appear that the Reformation gradually swept away the
black horrors of the tortureroom that the butchery of the headsmans
block ceased at the close of the civil contest which settled the line of
regal succession and that hanging which is the proper death of the cur
is now reserved for those only who place themselves out of the pale of
humanity by striking at human life

Deathbed MysteryIn conversation with an aged widowas devout and
sensible as she is unletteredI yesterday learned a deathbed mystery
which appeared new to me and which if not more commonly known than I take
it to be you may perhaps think worthy of a place in NOTES AND QUERIES
to serve as a minor satellite to some more luminous communication in reply
to B H at Vol i p 315 My informants religio as she appears to
have derived it by tradition from her mother and as confirmed by her own
experience in the case of a father a 52 husband several children and
others is to the effect that a considerable interval invariably elapses
between the first semblance of death and what she considers to be the
departure of the soul
About five minutes after the time when death to all outward appearance
has taken place the last breath as she describes may be seen to issue
with a vapour or steam out of the mouth of the departed
The statement reminds me of Websters argument in his Display of supposed
Witchcraft chap xvi where writing of the bleeding of corpses in
presence of their murderers he observes
If we physically consider the union of the soul with the body by the
mediation of the spirit then we cannot rationally conceive that the
soul doth utterly forsake that union until by putrefaction tending to
an absolute mutation it is forced to bid farewell to its beloved
tabernacle for its not operating ad extra to our senses doth not
necessarily infer its total absence And it may be that there is more
in that of Abels blood crying unto the Lord from the ground in a
physical sense than is commonly conceived c
Sir Kenelm Digby I think I remember has also made some curious remarks on
this subject in his observations on the Religio Medici of Sir T Brown

Easter EggsThe custom of dyeing eggs at Easter alluded to Vol i
pp 244 and 397 prevails in different parts of Cumberland and is
observed in this city probably more specially than in any other part of
England On Easter Monday and Tuesday the inhabitants assemble in certain
adjacent meadows the children all provided with stores of hardboiled
eggs coloured or ornamented in various wayssome being dyed an even
colour with logwood cochineal c others stained often in a rather
elegant manner by being boiled in shreds of particoloured ribbons and
others again covered with gilding These they tumble about upon the grass
until they break when they finish off by eating them These they call
paceeggs being no doubt a corruption for pasche
This custom is mentioned by Brande as existing among the modern Greeks but
I believe it will be found more or less in almost all parts of Christendom
I observed when in Syria during Easter quantities of eggs similarly dyed
but it did not occur to me at the time to inquire whether the practice was
connected with the season and whether it was not confined to the native
Christians
Information upon this point and also upon the general origin of this
ancient custom would be interesting

May Marriages Vol i p 467This superstition is one of those
which have descended to Christianity from Pagan observances and which the
people have adopted without knowing the cause or being able to assign a
reason Carmelli tells us that it still prevailed in Italy in 17502 It
was evidently of long standing in Ovids time as it had passed then into a
proverb among the people nearly two centuries afterwards Plutarch Qust
Rom 86 puts the question Greek Dia ti toi Maiou menos ouk agontai
gunaikas which he makes a vain endeavour to answer satisfactorily He
assigns three reasons first because May being between April and June
and April being consecrated to Venus and June to Juno those deities held
propitious to marriage were not to be slighted The Greeks were not less
observant of fitting seasons and the propitiation of the Greek gamelioi
theoi Secondly on account of the great expiatory celebration of the
Lemuria when women abstained from the bath and the careful cosmetic
decoration of their persons so necessary as a prelude to marriage rites
Thirdly as some say because May was the month of old men Majus a
Majoribus and therefore June being thought to be the month of the young
Junius a Junioribus was to be preferred The Romans however held other
seasons and days unpropitious to matrimony as the days in February when
the Parentalia were celebrated c June was the favourite month but no
marriage was celebrated without an augury being first consulted and its
auspices proved favourable Val Max lib ii c 1 It would be well
if some such superstitions observance among us could serve as a check to
illadvised and illtimed marriages and I would certainly advise all
prudent females to continue to think that
The girls are all stark naught that wed in May

Trash or SkrikerMany hundreds of persons there are in these
districts who place implicit credence in the reality of the appearance of a
death sign locally termed trash or skriker It has the appearance of a
large black dog with long shaggy hair and as the natives express it
eyes as big as saucers The first name is given to it form the peculiar
noise made by its feet when passing along resembling that of a heavy shoe
in a miry road The second appellation is in allusion to the sound of its
voice when heard by those parties who are unable to see the appearance
itself According to the statements of parties who have seen the trash
frequently it makes its appearance to some member of that family from
which death will shortly select his victim and at other times to some
very intimate acquaintance Should any one be so courageous as to follow
the appearance it usually makes its retreat with its eyes fronting 53
the pursuer and either sinks into the earth with a strange noise or is
lost upon the slightest momentary inattention Many have attempted to
strike it with any weapon they had at hand but although the appearance
stood its ground no material substance could ever be detected It may be
added that trash does not confine itself to churchyards though
frequently seen in such localities

COLVILS WHIGGS SUPPLICATION
Heber possessed a curious MS volume entitled A Poetical Miscellany
selected from the Works of the Men of Genius of the XVIIth Century In
Part XI of the Bibliotheca Heberiana it is thus described
The first part of this volume was obviously collected by a Scotchman
and it includes pieces by Ben Jonson Wither Dr Donne c It must
have been made in the latter part of the reign of Charles I The second
portion of the volume is a later production a humourous poem called a
Whigs Supplication by 54 S C in which there is a remarkable
notice of Cleveland Donne and Bass Divine The latter name somebody
has ignorantly altered not knowing probably who Bass Divine was
The poem is in imitation of Hudibras both in style and metre
It is somewhat singular that the writer of this notice never suspected that
the author of the second part and the collector of the first part of
the volume was Samuel Colvil whose celebrated poem The Whiggs
Supplication or the Scotch Hudibras went through so many editions from
1667 to 1796 This mock poem as the author terms it turns upon the
insurrection of the Covenanters in Scotland in the reign of Charles the
Second An interesting notice of it and other imitations of Hudibras will
be found in the Retrospective Review vol iii pp 317335

HUBERT LE SOEURS SIX BRASS STATUES
In a curious MS Diary of the early part of the seventeenth century lately
come into my possession I find the following entry concerning the
sculptor Hubert le Soeur
March 7 1628 Had an interview with ye famous and justly renowned
artiste H le Sueur who being late come to this countrie I had never
seene before He showed me several famous statues in brasse
This is probably the earliest notice of the celebrated pupil of John of
Bologna after his settlement in England Dallaway in his Anecdotes of the
Arts in England p 395 after stating that Hubert le Soeur arrived here
about the year 1630 says
If he was associated with Pierre Tacca who finished the horse in the
equestrian statue of Henry IV in 1610 left incomplete on the death of
his master John of Bologna two years preceding he must have been far
advanced in life Three only of his works in bronze are now known with
certainty to exist the equestrian statue of Charles I at Charing
Cross a bust of the same monarch with a casque in the Roman style
now at Stourhead and a statue in armour of William Herbert Earl of
Pembroke Lord High Chamberlain and Chancellor of Oxford The last was
given to the University by T Earl of Pembroke about the time of the
restoration
The several famous statues in brasse alluded to by the writer of the
Diary above quoted were probably those which afterwards ornamented the
gardens of St Jamess Palace Peacham in his Complete Gentleman 2nd
edit 4to 1634 having spoken of the collection of statues at Arundell
House says
King Charles also ever since his coming to the Crown hath amply
testified a royal liking of ancient Statues by causing a whole army of
foreign Emperors Captains and Senators all at once to land on his
coasts to come and do him homage and attend him in his Palaces of
Saint James and Somerset House A great part of these belonged to the
great Duke of Mantua and some of the old Greek marble bases columns
and altars were brought from the ruins of Apollos temple at Delos by
that noble and absolutely complete gentleman Sir Kenelm Digby Knt
In the garden of St James there are also half a dozen brass
statues rare ones cast by Hubert le Sueur his Majestys servant
now dwelling in St Bartholomews London the most industrious and
excellent statuary in all materials that ever this country enjoyed
The best of them is the Gladiator moulded from that in Cardinal
Borghesis Villa by the procurement and industry of ingenious Master
Gage And at this present the said Master Sueur hath divers other
admirable moulds to cast in brass for his Majesty and among the rest
that famous Diana of Ephesus But the great Horse with his Majesty upon
it twice as great as the life and now well nigh finished will
compare with that of the New Bridge at Paris or those others at
Florence and Madrid though made by Sueur his master John de Bologna
that rare workman who not long since lived at Florence
The bronze statue of the Gladiator originally stood according to Ned
Wards London Spy in the Parade facing the Horse Guards Dodsley
Environs iii 741 says it was removed by Queen Anne to Hampton Court
and from thence by George the Fourth to the private grounds of Windsor
Castle where it now is Query What has become of the other five famous
statues in brass

He had collected an excellent library of books of all sorts not

THE LOW WINDOW
The low windows in the chancel of so many of our ancient churches have
proved a fruitful source of discussion among archologists and numerous
theories have been advanced respecting their use Perhaps the words of the
chameleon in the fable might be addressed to many who have attempted to
account for their existence You all are right and all are wrongright
in your supposition that they were thus used but wrong in maintaining that
this was the exclusive purpose Some example in fact may be adduced
irreconcileable with any particular conjecture and sufficient to overturn
