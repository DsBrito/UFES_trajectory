Neither the vegetation nor people in this book are entirely fictitious
But reader no person pictured here is you With one exception You
Sir Miss or Madamwhatever your country or stationare Albert
Weener As I am Albert Weener
ONE
Albert Weener Begins
1 I always knew I should write a book Something to help tired minds
lay aside the cares of the day But I always say you never can tell
whats around the corner till you turn it and everyone has become so
accustomed to fantastic occurrences in the last twenty one years that
the inspiring and relaxing novel I used to dream about would be today as
unreal as Atlantis Instead I find I must write of the things which
have happened to me in that time
It all began with the word itself
Grass Gramina The family Gramineae Grasses
Oh I responded doubtfully The picture in my mind was only of a vague
area in parks edged with benches for the idle
Anyway I was far too resentful to pay strict attention I had set out
in good faith not for the first time in my career as a salesman to
answer an ad offering 50 or more daily to top producers naturally
expecting the searching onceover of an alert salesmanager back to the
light behind a shinytopped desk When youve handled as many products as
I had an ad like that has the right sound But the world is full of
crackpots and some of the most pernicious are those who hoodwink
unsuspecting canvassers into anticipating a sizzling deal where there is
actually only a warm hope No genuinely highclass proposition ever came
from a layout without aggressiveness enough to put on some kind of
front working out of an office for instance not an outdated rundown
apartment in the wrong part of Hollywood
Its only a temporary drawback Weener which restricts the
Metamorphizers efficacy to grasses
The wheeling syllables coming in a deep voice from the middleaged
woman emphasized the absurdity of the whole business The snuffy
apartment the unhomelike livingroomdust and books its only
furniturethe unbelievable kitchen looking like a pictured warning to
housewives were only guffaws before the final buffoonery of discovering
the J S Francis whod inserted that promising ad to be Josephine Spencer
Francis Wrong location wrong atmosphere wrong gender
Now Im not the sort of man who would restrict women to a place in the
nursery No indeed I believe they are in some ways just as capable as I
am If Miss Francis had been one of those wellgroomed efficient ladies
who have earned their place in the business world without at the same
time sacrificing femininity Im sure I would not have suffered such a
pang for my lost time and carfare
But wellgroomed and feminine were alike inapplicable adjectives
Towering above meshe was at least five foot ten while I am of average
heightshe strode up and down the kitchen which apparently was office
and laboratory also waving her arms speaking too exuberantly the
antithesis of moderation and restraint She was an aggregate of
cylinders big and small Her shapeless legs were columns with large
flatheeled shoes for their bases supporting the inverted pediment of
great hips Her too short greasespotted skirt was a mighty barrel and
on it was placed the tremendous drum of her torso
A little more work she rumbled a few interesting problems solved
and the Metamorphizer will change the basic structure of any plant
inoculated with it
Large as she was her face and head were disproportionately big Her
eyes I can only speak of as enormous I dare say there are some who
would have called them beautiful In moments of intensity they bored
into mine and held them till I felt quite uncomfortable
Think of what this discovery means she urged me Think of it
Weener Plants will be capable of making use of anything within reach
Understand Weener anything Rocks quartz decomposed
graniteanything
She took a gold victorian toothpick from the pocket of her mannish
jacket and used it energetically I shuddered Unfortunately she went
on a little indistinctly unfortunately I lack resources for further
experiment right now
This too I thought despairingly A slight cash investmentjust enough
to get production startedhow many wishful times Ive heard it I was a
salesman not a sucker and anyway I was for the moment without liquid
capital
It will change the face of the world Weener No more usedup areas no
more frantic scrabbling for the few bits of naturally rich ground no
more struggle to get artificial fertilizers to wornout soil in the face
of ignorance and poverty
She thrust out a handsurprisingly finely and economically molded
barely missing a piledup heap of dishes crowned by a flowerpot trailing
droopy tendrils Excitedly she paced the floor largely taken up by jars
and flats of vegetation some green and flourishing others gray and
sickly all constricting her movements as did the stove supporting a
glass tank robbed of the goldfish which should rightfully have gaped
against its sides and containing instead some slimy growth topped by a
bubbling brown scum I simply couldnt understand how any woman could so
far oppose what must have been her natural instinct as to live and work
in such a slatternly place It wasnt just her kitchen which was
disordered and dirty her person too was slovenly and possibly unclean
The lank gray hair swishing about her ears was dark perhaps from vigor
but more likely from frugality with soap and water Her massive
heavychinned face was untouched by makeup and suggested an equal
innocence of other attentions
Fertilizers Poo Expedients Weenermiserable makeshift expedients
Her unavoidable eyes bit into mine What is a fertilizer A tidbit a
pap a lollypop Indians use fish Chinese nightsoil agricultural
chemists concoct tasty tonics of nitrogen and potashwheres your
progress Putting a mechanical whip on a buggy instead of inventing an
internal combustion engine Ive gone directly to the heart of the
matter Like Watt Like Maxwell Like Almroth Wright No use being held
back because youve only poor materials to work withleap ahead with
imagination Change the plant itself Weener change the plant itself
It was no longer politeness which held me If I could have freed myself
from her eyes I would have escaped thankfully
Nourishm on anything she shouted rubbing the round end of the
toothpick vigorously into her ear Sow a barren waste a worthless
slagheap with lifegiving corn or wheat inoculate the plants with the
Metamorphizerand you have a crop fatter than Iowas or the Ukraines
best The whole world will teem with abundance
Perhapsbut what was the sales angle Where did I come in I didnt know
a dandelion from a toadstool and was quite content to keep my distance
from nature Had she inserted the ad merely to lure a listener Her
whole procedure was irregular not a word about territories and
commissions If I could bring her to the point of mentioning the
necessary investment maybe I could get away gracefully You said you
were stuck I prompted resolved to get the painful interview over
with
Stuck Stuck Ohmoney to perfect the Metamorphizer Luckily it will
do it itself
I dont catch
Look about youwhat do you see
I glanced around and started to say a measuring glass on a dirty plate
next to half a cold fried egg but she stopped me with a sweep of her
arm which came dangerously close to the flasks and retortsall holding
dirtycolored liquidswhich cluttered the sink No no I mean
outside
I couldnt see outside because instead of a window I was facing a sickly
leaf unaccountably preserved in a jar of alcohol I said nothing
Metaphorically of course Wheatfields Acres and acres of wheat
Bread wheat a grass And cornfields Iowa Wisconsin Illinoisnot a
state in the Union without corn Milo oats sorghum ryeall grasses
And the Metamorphizer will work on all of them
Im always a man with an open mind She mightit was just possibleshe
might have something afterall But could I work with her Go out in the
sticks and talk to farmers learn to sit on fence rails and whittle
asking after crops as if they were of interest to me No no  it was
fantastic out of the question
A different more practical setup now At least there would have been
no lack of prospects if you wanted to go miles from civilization to
find them no answers like We never read magazines thank you Of course
it was hardly believable a woman without interest in keeping herself
presentable could invent any such fabulous product but there was a bare
chance of making a few sales just on the idea
The idea It suddenly struck me she had the whole thing backwards
Grasses she said and went on about wheat and corn and going out to the
rubes Southern California was dotted with lawns wasnt it Why rush
around to the hinterland when there was a big territory next door And
undoubtedly a better one
Revive your old tired lawn I improvised No manures fuss cuss or
muss One shot of the Metaone shot of Francis Amazing Discovery and
your lawn springs to new life
Lawns Nonsense she snorted rudely I thought Do you think Ive
spent years in order to satisfy suburban vanity Lawns indeed
Lawns indeed Miss Francis I retorted with some spirit Im a
salesman and I know something about marketing a product Yours should be
sold to householders for their lawns
Should it Well I say it shouldnt Listen to me there are two ways of
making a discovery One is to cut off a cats hindleg The discovery is
then made that a cat with one leg cut off has three legs Hah
The other way is to find out your need and then search for a method of
filling it My work is with plants I dont take a daisy and see if I
can make it produce a red and black petaled monstrosity If I did Id be
a fashionable horticulturist delighted to encourage imbeciles to grow
grass in a desert
My method is the second one I want no more backward countries no more
famines in India or China no more dustbowls no more wars depressions
hungry children For this I produced the Metamorphizerto make not two
blades of grass grow where one sprouted before but whole fields
flourish where only rocks and sandpiles lay
No Weener it wont doI cant trade in my vision as a downpayment on
a means to encourage a waste of ground seed and water You may think I
lost such rights when I thought up the name Metamorphizer to appeal on
the popular level but theres a difference
That was a clincher Anyone who believed Metamorphizer had salesappeal
just wasnt all there But why should I disillusion her and wound her
pride Down underneath her rough exterior I supposed she could be as
sensitive as I and I hope I am not without chivalry
I said nothing but of course her interdiction of the only possibility
killed any weakening inclination And yet  yet Afterall I had to
have something
All right Weener This pump she produced miraculously from the
jumble an unwieldy engine dragging a long and tangling tail of hose
behind it the end lost among mementos of unfinished meals this pump
is full of the Metamorphizer enough to inoculate a hundred and fifty
acres when added in proper proportion to the irrigating water I have a
table worked out to show you about that The tank holds five gallons
get 50 a gallona dollar and a half an acre and keep ten percent for
yourself Be sure to return the pump every night
I had to say for her that when she got down to business she didnt waste
any words Perhaps this contrasting directness so startled me I was
roped in before I could refuse On the other hand of course I would be
helping out someone who needed my assistance badly since she couldnt
with all the obvious factors against her be having a very easy time
Sometimes it is advisable to temper business judgment with kindness
Her first offer was ridiculous in its assumption that a salesmans
talent skill and effort were worth only a miserable ten percent as
though I were a literary agent with something a cinch to sell I began
to feel more at home as we ironed out the details and I brought the
knowledge acquired with much hard work and painful experience into the
bargaining Fifty percent I wanted and fifty percent I finally got by
demanding seventyfive She became as interested in the contest as she
had been before in benefits to humanity and I perceived a keen mind
under all her eccentricity
I cant truthfully say I got to like her but I reconciled myself and
eventually was on my way with the pumpa trifling weight to Miss
Francis judging by the way she handled it but uncomfortably heavy to
mestrapped to my back and ten feet of recalcitrant hose coiled round
my shoulder She turned her imperious eyes on me again and repeated for
the fourth or fifth time the instructions for applying as though I were
less intelligent than she I went out through the barren livingroom and
took a backward glance at the scaling stucco walls of the
apartmenthouse shaking my head It was a queer place for Albert Weener
the crackerjack salesman who had once led his team in a national contest
to put over a threepiece aluminum deal to be working out of And for a
woman And for such a woman
2 Everything is for the best is my philosophy and Make your cross
your crutch is a good thought to hold so I reminded myself that it
takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown and no one sees the bright
side of things if he wears dark glasses Since it takes all kinds to
make a world and Josephine Spencer Francis was one of those kinds wasnt
it only reasonable to suppose there were other kinds who would buy the
stuff shed invented The only way to sell something is first to sell
yourself and I piously went over the virtues of the Metamorphizer in my
mind What if by its very nature there could be no repeat business I
wasnt tying myself to it for life
All that remained was to find myself a customer I tried to recall the
location of the nearest rural territory San Fernando valley
probablya long tiresome trip And expensive unless I wished to
demean myself by thumbing ridesa difficult thing to do burdened as I
was by the pump If she hadnt balked unreasonably about putting the
stuff on lawns Id have prospects right at hand
I was suddenly lawnconscious There was probably not a Los Angeles
street I hadnt covered at some timemagazines vacuums old gold
nearnylonsand I must have been aware of green spaces before
most of the houses but now for the first time I saw lawns Neat
sharply confined smoothshaven lawns Sagging slipping
eagertokeepupappearances but fightingalosinggame lawns Ragged
weedy dissolute lawns Halfbare repulsively crippled hummocky lawns
Bright lawns insistent on former respectability and trimness yellow
and gray lawns touched with the craziness of age quite beyond all
interest in looks content to doze easily in the sun If Miss Francis
mixture was on the upandup and she hadnt introduced a perfectly
unreasonable conditionwhy I couldnt miss
On the other hand I thought suddenly Im the salesman not she It was
up to me as a practical man to determine where and how I could sell to
the best advantage With sudden resolution I walked over a twinkling
greensward and rang the bell
Good afternoon madam I can see from your garden youre a lady whos
interested in keeping it lovely
Not my garden and Mrs Smiths not home The door shut Not gently
The next house had no lawn at all but was fronted with a rank growth of
ivy I felt no one had a right to plant ivy when I was selling something
effective only on the family Gramineae I tramped over the ivy hard and
rang the doorbell on the other side
Good afternoon madam I can see from the appearance of your lawn youre
a lady who really cares for her garden Im introducing to a restricted
groupjust one or two in each neighborhooda new preparation an
astounding discovery by a renowned scientist which will make your grass
twice as green and many times as vigorous upon one application without
the aid of anything else natural or artificial
My gardener takes care of all that
But madam
There is a city ordinance against unlicensed solicitors Have you a
license young man
After the fifth refusal I began to think less unkindly of Miss Francis
idea of selling the stuff to farmers and to wonder what was wrong with
my technique After some understandable hesitationfor I dont make a
practice of being odd or conspicuousI sat down on the curb to think
Besides the pump was getting wearisomely heavy I couldnt decide
exactly what was unsatisfactory in my routine The stuff had neither
been used nor advertised so there could be no prejudice against it no
one had yet allowed me to get so far as quoting price so it wasnt too
expensive
The process of elimination brought me to the absurd conclusion that the
fault must lie in me Not in my appearance I reasoned for I was a
personable young man a little over thirty at the time with no obvious
defects a few visits to the dentist wouldnt have removed Of course I do
have an unfortunate skin condition but such a things an act of God as
the lawyers say and people must take me as I am
No it wasnt my appearance  or was it That monstrously outsized
pump Who wanted to listen to a salestalk from a man apparently prepared
for an immediate gasattack There is little use in pressing your
trousers between two boards under the mattress if you discount such
neatness with the accouterment of an invading Martian I uncoiled the
hose from my shoulder and eased the incubus from my back Leaving them
visible from the corner of my eye I crossed the most miserable lawn yet
encountered
It was composed of what I since learned is Bermuda a plant most
Southern Californians callwith many profane prefixesdevilgrass It
was yellow the dirty grayish yellow of moldy straw and bald scuffed
spots immodestly exposed the cracked parched earth beneath Over the
walk interwoven stolons had been felted down into a ragged mat
repellent alike to foot and eye Perversely onto what had once been
flowerbeds the runners crept erect bristling spines showing faintly
green on topthe only live color in the miserable expanse Where the
grass had gone to seed there were patches of muddy purple patches which
enhanced rather than relieved the diseased color of the whole and
emphasized the dying air of the yard It was a neglected unvalued
thing an odious appendage a mistake never rectified
Madam I began your lawn is deplorable There was no use giving her
the line about Icanseeyouarealadywhocaresforlovelythings
Anyway now the pump was off my back I felt reckless I threw the whole
book of salesmanship away Its the most neglected lawn in the
neighborhood It is madam Im sorry to say no less than a disgrace
She was a woman beyond the age of childbearing her dress revealing the
outlines of her corset and she looked at me coldly through rimless
glassing biting the bridge of her inadequate nose So what she asked
Madam I said for ten dollars I can make this the finest lawn in the
block the pride of your family and the envy of your neighbors
I can do better things with ten dollars than spend it on a bunch of
dead grass
Gratefully I knew I had her then and was glad I hadnt weakly given in to
an impulse to carry out the crackpots original instructions When they
start to argue my motto is theyre sold I took a good breath and wound
up for the clincher
I wont say she was an easy sale but afterall Im a psychologist I
found all her weak points and touched them expertly Even so she made
me cut my price in half leaving me only twofifty according to my
agreement with Miss Francis but it was an icebreaker
I got the pump and hose collecting at the same time an audience of
brats who assisted me by shouting What ya goin a do mister Whats
at thing for mister You goin a water Mrs Dinkmans frontyard
mister Do your teeth awwis look so funny mister My grampa takes his
teeth out at night and putsm in a glass of water Do you take out your
teeth at night mister You goin a put that stuff on our garden too
mister Hay Shirleycome on over and see the funnylooking man whos
fixing up Dinkmans yard
They were untiring shrilling their questions exclamations and
comments completely driving from my mind the details of the actual
application of the Metamorphizer Anyway Miss Francis had been
concerned with putting it in the irrigation waterwhich didnt apply in
this case I thought a moment A gallon was enough for thirty acres
half a pint should suffice for thismore than suffice Irrigation
water nonsenseId squirt it on and tell the woman to hose it down
afterwardthatd be the same as putting it in the water wouldnt it
To come to this practical conclusion under the brunt of the childrens
assault was a remarkable feat As I dribbled the stuff over the sorry
devilgrass they kicked the pumpand my shinsmimicking my actions
tripping me as they skipped under my legs getting wet with the
MetamorphizerI hoped with mutually deleterious effectand generally
making me more than ever thankful for my bachelor condition
Twofifty I thought angrily squirting a fine mist at a particularly
dreary spotand it isnt even selling Manual labor Working with my
hands I might as well be a gardener College training Wide experience
Alert and aggressive In order to dribble stuff smelling sickeningly of
carnations on a wasted yard I coiled up my hose disgustedly and
collected a reluctant five dollars
It dont look any different commented Mrs Dinkman dubiously
Madam Professor Francis remarkable discovery works miracles but not
in the twinkling of an eye In a week youll see for yourself provided
of course you wet it down properly
In a week youll be far gone with my five dollars diagnosed Mrs
Dinkman
While this might be superficially true it was an unfair and unkind
thing to say and it wounded me I reached into my pocket and drew out
an old cardone printed before Id had an irreconcilable difference
with the firm employing me at the time
I can always be reached at this address Mrs Dinkman I said should
you have any cause for dissatisfactionwhich Im sure is quite
impossible Besides I shall be daily in this district demonstrating the
value of Dr Francis Lawn Tonic
That was certainly true unless I made a better connection Degrading
manual labor or not I intended to sell as many local people as possible
on the strength of having found a weak spot in the wall of
salesresistance before the effects of the Metamorphizer became apparent
For in strict confidence and despite its being an undesirable negative
attitude I was a little dubious that those effectsor lack of
themwould stimulate further sales
3 My alarmclock as it did every morning Sundays included rang at
sixthirty for I am a man of habit I turned it off remembering
instantly I had given Miss Francis neither her pump nor her share of the
sale Of course it was more convenient and timesaving to bring them both
together and I was sure she didnt expect me to follow instructions to
the letter like an officeboy any more in these matters than she had in
her restriction to agricultural use
Still it was remiss of me The fact is I had spent her money as well
as my ownnot on dissipation I hasten to say but on dinner and an
installment of my roomrent This was embarrassing but I looked upon it
merely as an advancequite as if Id had the customary
drawingaccountto be charged against my next commissions My acceptance
of the advance merely indicated my faith in the future of the
Metamorphizer
I dissolved a yeastcake in a glass of water its very healthy and Id
heard it alleviated dermal irritations Lathering my face I glanced
over the list culled from the dictionary and stuck in the mirror the
night before for I have never been too tired to improve my mind By
this easy method of increasing my vocabulary I had progressed at the
time down to the letter K
While drinking my coffeenever more than two cupsit was my custom to
read and digest stock and bond quotations for though I had no
investmentsthe only time I had been able to take a flurry there was an
unforeseen recession in the marketI thought a man who didnt keep up
with trends and conditions unfitted for a place in the businessworld
Besides I didnt expect to be straitened indefinitely and I believed in
being ready to take proper advantage of opportunity when it came
As a man may devote the graver part of his mind to a subject and then
turn for relaxation to a lighter aspect so I had for years been
interested in a stock called Consolidated Pemmican and Allied
Concentrates It wasnt a highpriced issue nor were its fluctuations
startling For six months of the year year in and year out it would be
quoted at 116 of a cent a share for the other six months it stood at
18 I didnt know what pemmican was and I didnt particularly care but
if a man could invest at 116 he could double his money overnight when
it rose to 18 Then he could reverse the process by selling before it
went down and so snowball into fortune It was a daydream but a
harmless one
Satisfying myself Consolidated Pemmican was bumbling along at its low
level I reluctantly prepared to resume Miss Francis pump It seemed
less heavy as I wound the hose over my shoulder and I felt this wasnt
due to the negligible quantity Id expended on Mrs Dinkmans grass I
just knew I was going to have a successful day I had to
In moments of fancy I often think a salesman is more truly a creative
artist than many of those who arrogate the title to themselves He uses
words on one hand and the receptivity of prospects on the other to
mold a cohesive and satisfying whole a work of Art signed and dated on
the dotted line Like any such work the creation implies thoughtful and
careful preparation So it was that I got off the bus polishing a new
salestalk to fit the changed situation One of your neighbors  I
have just applied  I sneered my way past those houses refusing my
services the day before they couldnt have the Metamorphizer at any
price now Then it hit my eyes
Mrs Dinkmans lawn I mean
The one so neglected ailing and yellow only yesterday
It wasnt sad and sickly now The most enthusiastic homeowner wouldnt
have disdained it There wasnt a single bare spot visible in the whole
lush healthy expanse And it was green Green Not just here and there
but over every inch of soft undulating surface a pale applegreen where
the blades waved to expose its underparts and a rich dazzling emerald
on top Even the runners sinuously encroaching upon the sidewalk were
deeply virescent
The Metamorphizer worked
The Metamorphizer not only worked but it worked with unbelievable
rapidity Overnight I knew nothing about the speed at which ordinary
fertilizers plant stimulants or hormones took hold but commonsense
told me nothing like this had ever happened so quickly I had been
indulging in a little legitimate puffery in saying the inoculant worked
miracles but if anything that had been an understatement It just went
to show how impossible it is for a real salesman to be too enthusiastic
Nerves in knees and fingers quivering I walked over to join the group
curiously inspecting the translated lawn I I had done this out of
the most miserable Id made the loveliestand for a paltry five
dollars I tried to recapture the memory of what it had looked like in
order to relish the contrast more but it was impossible the vivid
present blotted out the decayed past completely
Overnight someone said Yessir just overnight Wouldnt of believed
it if I hadnt noticed just yesterday how much worse an the city dump it
looked
Bet at stuffs ten inches high
Brother you can say that again Footd be closer
Anyhow its uh fattestlookin grass I seen sence I lef Texas
An the greenest Guess I never did see such a green before
While they exclaimed about the beauty and vigor of the growth my mind
was racing in high along practical lines Achievement isnt worth much
unless you can harness it and in todays triumph I saw tomorrows
benefit No more canvassing with a pump undignifiedly on my back no
more manual labor no bold as the thought was not even any more direct
selling for me This was big too big to be approached in any cockroach
buildupslowlyfromthebottom way It was a real top deal in a class
with nylon or jukeboxes or bubblegum You could smell the money in it
First of all Id have to tie Josephine Francis down with an ironclad
contract Agents dealerships distributors and a general salesmanager
Albert Weener at the top Incorporate Get it all down in black and
white and signed by Miss Francis right away For her own good An
idealistic scientist a frail woman protect her from the vultures whod
try to rob her as soon as they saw what the Metamorphizer would do Such
a woman wouldnt have any business sense Id see she got a comfortable
living out of it and free her from responsibility Then she could potter
around all she liked
Incorporate Interest big money Put it on a nationwide basis A cut for
the general salesmanager on every sale Besides stock Take the patent
in the companys name In six months Id be on my way to being a
millionaire I had certainly been right up on my toes in picking the
Metamorphizer as a winner in spite of Miss Francis kitchen and her lack
of aggressiveness Instinct the unerring instinct of a wideawake
salesman for the right productand for the right market I mustnt
forget that Had I been content with her original limitation Id still
be bumbling around trying to interest Farmer Hicks in some Metamorphizer
for his hay
Ja notice how thick it was
Well thats Bermuda for you Tell me they actually plant it on purpose
in Florida
No kiddin
Yessir Know one thingeven if it looks pretty right now I wouldnt
want that stuff on my place Have to cut it every day
Bet ya Toughlookin too I rather take my exercise in bed
Thats an angle I thoughthave to get old lady Francis to modify her
formula or something Else well never get rich Slow down the rate of
growth dilute itought to be more profitable too Have to find out
how cheaply the inoculant can be producedno more inefficient hand
methods Of course the fastness of growth wouldnt affect the sale to
farmershelp it in fact No doubt shed had more than I originally
thought in that aspect I conceded generously We could let them apply
it themselves  mailorder advertising  cut costs that way Think
of clover and alfalfaor werent they grasses Anyway imagine hay or
wheat as tall as Iowa corn and corn higher than a smalltown cityhall
Fortunethered be a dozen fortunes in it
I began perspiring The deal was getting bigger and bigger It wasnt
just a simple matter of cutting in on a good thing All the angles
