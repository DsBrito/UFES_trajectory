pair of felt boots a peasant gave him to sole with leather
Simon felt downhearted He spent the twenty kopeks on vodka and started
homewards without having bought any skins In the morning he had felt
the frost but now after drinking the vodka he felt warm even without
a sheepskin coat He trudged along striking his stick on the frozen
earth with one hand swinging the felt boots with the other and talking
to himself
I
Im quite warm said he though I have no sheepskin coat Ive had
a drop and it runs through all my veins I need no sheepskins I go
along and dont worry about anything Thats the sort of man I am What
do I care I can live without sheepskins I dont need them My wife
will fret to be sure And true enough it is a shame one works all
day long and then does not get paid Stop a bit If you dont bring
that money along sure enough Ill skin you blessed if I dont Hows
that He pays twenty kopeks at a time What can I do with twenty kopeks
Drink itthats all one can do Hard up he says he is So he may
bebut what about me You have a house and cattle and everything
Ive only what I stand up in You have corn of your own growing I have
to buy every grain Do what I will I must spend three roubles every
week for bread alone I come home and find the bread all used up and I
have to fork out another rouble and a half So just pay up what you owe
and no nonsense about it
By this time he had nearly reached the shrine at the bend of the road
Looking up he saw something whitish behind the shrine The daylight was
fading and the shoemaker peered at the thing without being able to make
out what it was There was no white stone here before Can it be an ox
Its not like an ox It has a head like a man but its too white and
what could a man be doing there
He came closer so that it was clearly visible To his surprise it
really was a man alive or dead sitting naked leaning motionless
against the shrine Terror seized the shoemaker and he thought Some
one has killed him stripped him and left him there If I meddle I
shall surely get into trouble
So the shoemaker went on He passed in front of the shrine so that he
could not see the man When he had gone some way he looked back and
saw that the man was no longer leaning against the shrine but was
moving as if looking towards him The shoemaker felt more frightened
than before and thought Shall I go back to him or shall I go on If
I go near him something dreadful may happen Who knows who the fellow
is He has not come here for any good If I go near him he may jump
up and throttle me and there will be no getting away Or if not hed
still be a burden on ones hands What could I do with a naked man I
couldnt give him my last clothes Heaven only help me to get away
So the shoemaker hurried on leaving the shrine behind himwhen suddenly
his conscience smote him and he stopped in the road
What are you doing Simon said he to himself The man may be dying
of want and you slip past afraid Have you grown so rich as to be
afraid of robbers Ah Simon shame on you
So he turned back and went up to the man
II
Simon approached the stranger looked at him and saw that he was a
young man fit with no bruises on his body only evidently freezing and
frightened and he sat there leaning back without looking up at Simon
as if too faint to lift his eyes Simon went close to him and then the
man seemed to wake up Turning his head he opened his eyes and looked
into Simons face That one look was enough to make Simon fond of the
man He threw the felt boots on the ground undid his sash laid it on
the boots and took off his cloth coat
Its not a time for talking said he Come put this coat on at
once And Simon took the man by the elbows and helped him to rise As
he stood there Simon saw that his body was clean and in good condition
his hands and feet shapely and his face good and kind He threw
his coat over the mans shoulders but the latter could not find the
sleeves Simon guided his arms into them and drawing the coat well on
wrapped it closely about him tying the sash round the mans waist
Simon even took off his torn cap to put it on the mans head but then
his own head felt cold and he thought Im quite bald while he has
long curly hair So he put his cap on his own head again It will be
better to give him something for his feet thought he and he made the
man sit down and helped him to put on the felt boots saying There
friend now move about and warm yourself Other matters can be settled
later on Can you walk
The man stood up and looked kindly at Simon but could not say a word
Why dont you speak said Simon Its too cold to stay here we must
be getting home There now take my stick and if youre feeling weak
lean on that Now step out
The man started walking and moved easily not lagging behind
As they went along Simon asked him And where do you belong to Im
not from these parts
I thought as much I know the folks hereabouts But how did you come
to be there by the shrine
I cannot tell
Has some one been illtreating you
No one has illtreated me God has punished me
Of course God rules all Still youll have to find food and shelter
somewhere Where do you want to go to
It is all the same to me
Simon was amazed The man did not look like a rogue and he spoke
gently but yet he gave no account of himself Still Simon thought Who
knows what may have happened And he said to the stranger Well then
come home with me and at least warm yourself awhile
So Simon walked towards his home and the stranger kept up with him
walking at his side The wind had risen and Simon felt it cold under his
shirt He was getting over his tipsiness by now and began to feel the
frost He went along sniffling and wrapping his wifes coat round him
and he thought to himself There nowtalk about sheepskins I went
out for sheepskins and come home without even a coat to my back and
what is more Im bringing a naked man along with me Matryona wont
be pleased And when he thought of his wife he felt sad but when he
looked at the stranger and remembered how he had looked up at him at the
shrine his heart was glad
III
Simons wife had everything ready early that day She had cut wood
brought water fed the children eaten her own meal and now she sat
thinking She wondered when she ought to make bread now or tomorrow
There was still a large piece left
If Simon has had some dinner in town thought she and does not eat
much for supper the bread will last out another day
She weighed the piece of bread in her hand again and again and thought
I wont make any more today We have only enough flour left to bake one
batch We can manage to make this last out till Friday
So Matryona put away the bread and sat down at the table to patch her
husbands shirt While she worked she thought how her husband was buying
skins for a winter coat
If only the dealer does not cheat him My good man is much too simple
he cheats nobody but any child can take him in Eight roubles is a lot
of moneyhe should get a good coat at that price Not tanned skins but
still a proper winter coat How difficult it was last winter to get on
without a warm coat I could neither get down to the river nor go out
anywhere When he went out he put on all we had and there was nothing
left for me He did not start very early today but still its time he
was back I only hope he has not gone on the spree
Hardly had Matryona thought this when steps were heard on the
threshold and some one entered Matryona stuck her needle into her work
and went out into the passage There she saw two men Simon and with
him a man without a hat and wearing felt boots
Matryona noticed at once that her husband smelt of spirits There
now he has been drinking thought she And when she saw that he was
coatless had only her jacket on brought no parcel stood there silent
and seemed ashamed her heart was ready to break with disappointment
He has drunk the money thought she and has been on the spree with
some goodfornothing fellow whom he has brought home with him
Matryona let them pass into the hut followed them in and saw that the
stranger was a young slight man wearing her husbands coat There
was no shirt to be seen under it and he had no hat Having entered he
stood neither moving nor raising his eyes and Matryona thought He
must be a bad manhes afraid
Matryona frowned and stood beside the oven looking to see what they
would do
Simon took off his cap and sat down on the bench as if things were all
right
Come Matryona if supper is ready let us have some
Matryona muttered something to herself and did not move but stayed
where she was by the oven She looked first at the one and then at
the other of them and only shook her head Simon saw that his wife was
annoyed but tried to pass it off Pretending not to notice anything he
took the stranger by the arm
Sit down friend said he and let us have some supper
The stranger sat down on the bench
Havent you cooked anything for us said Simon
Matryonas anger boiled over Ive cooked but not for you It seems to
me you have drunk your wits away You went to buy a sheepskin coat
but come home without so much as the coat you had on and bring a naked
vagabond home with you I have no supper for drunkards like you
Thats enough Matryona Dont wag your tongue without reason You had
better ask what sort of man
And you tell me what youve done with the money
Simon found the pocket of the jacket drew out the threerouble note
and unfolded it
Here is the money Trifonof did not pay but promises to pay soon
Matryona got still more angry he had bought no sheepskins but had
put his only coat on some naked fellow and had even brought him to their
house
She snatched up the note from the table took it to put away in safety
and said I have no supper for you We cant feed all the naked
drunkards in the world
There now Matryona hold your tongue a bit First hear what a man has
to say
Much wisdom I shall hear from a drunken fool I was right in not
wanting to marry youa drunkard The linen my mother gave me you drank
and now youve been to buy a coatand have drunk it too
Simon tried to explain to his wife that he had only spent twenty kopeks
tried to tell how he had found the manbut Matryona would not let him
get a word in She talked nineteen to the dozen and dragged in things
that had happened ten years before
Matryona talked and talked and at last she flew at Simon and seized him
by the sleeve
Give me my jacket It is the only one I have and you must needs take
it from me and wear it yourself Give it here you mangy dog and may
the devil take you
Simon began to pull off the jacket and turned a sleeve of it inside
out Matryona seized the jacket and it burst its seams She snatched it
up threw it over her head and went to the door She meant to go out
but stopped undecidedshe wanted to work off her anger but she also
wanted to learn what sort of a man the stranger was
IV
Matryona stopped and said If he were a good man he would not be naked
Why he hasnt even a shirt on him If he were all right you would say
where you came across the fellow
Thats just what I am trying to tell you said Simon As I came to
the shrine I saw him sitting all naked and frozen It isnt quite
the weather to sit about naked God sent me to him or he would have
perished What was I to do How do we know what may have happened to
him So I took him clothed him and brought him along Dont be so
angry Matryona It is a sin Remember we all must die one day
Angry words rose to Matryonas lips but she looked at the stranger
and was silent He sat on the edge of the bench motionless his hands
folded on his knees his head drooping on his breast his eyes closed
and his brows knit as if in pain Matryona was silent and Simon said
Matryona have you no love of God
Matryona heard these words and as she looked at the stranger suddenly
her heart softened towards him She came back from the door and going
to the oven she got out the supper Setting a cup on the table she
poured out some kvas Then she brought out the last piece of bread and
set out a knife and spoons
Eat if you want to said she
Simon drew the stranger to the table
Take your place young man said he
Simon cut the bread crumbled it into the broth and they began to eat
Matryona sat at the corner of the table resting her head on her hand and
looking at the stranger
And Matryona was touched with pity for the stranger and began to feel
fond of him And at once the strangers face lit up his brows were no
longer bent he raised his eyes and smiled at Matryona
When they had finished supper the woman cleared away the things and
began questioning the stranger Where are you from said she
I am not from these parts
But how did you come to be on the road
I may not tell
Did some one rob you
God punished me
And you were lying there naked
Yes naked and freezing Simon saw me and had pity on me He took off
his coat put it on me and brought me here And you have fed me given
me drink and shown pity on me God will reward you
Matryona rose took from the window Simons old shirt she had been
patching and gave it to the stranger She also brought out a pair of
trousers for him
There said she I see you have no shirt Put this on and lie down
where you please in the loft or on the oven
The stranger took off the coat put on the shirt and lay down in the
loft Matryona put out the candle took the coat and climbed to where
her husband lay
Matryona drew the skirts of the coat over her and lay down but could
not sleep she could not get the stranger out of her mind
When she remembered that he had eaten their last piece of bread and that
there was none for tomorrow and thought of the shirt and trousers she
had given away she felt grieved but when she remembered how he had
smiled her heart was glad
Long did Matryona lie awake and she noticed that Simon also was
awakehe drew the coat towards him
Simon
Well
You have had the last of the bread and I have not put any to rise
I dont know what we shall do tomorrow Perhaps I can borrow some of
neighbor Martha
If were alive we shall find something to eat
The woman lay still awhile and then said He seems a good man but why
does he not tell us who he is
I suppose he has his reasons
Simon
Well
We give but why does nobody give us anything
Simon did not know what to say so he only said Let us stop talking
and turned over and went to sleep
V
In the morning Simon awoke The children were still asleep his wife
had gone to the neighbors to borrow some bread The stranger alone was
sitting on the bench dressed in the old shirt and trousers and looking
upwards His face was brighter than it had been the day before
Simon said to him Well friend the belly wants bread and the naked
body clothes One has to work for a living What work do you know
I do not know any
This surprised Simon but he said Men who want to learn can learn
anything
Men work and I will work also
What is your name
Michael
Well Michael if you dont wish to talk about yourself that is your
own affair but youll have to earn a living for yourself If you will
work as I tell you I will give you food and shelter
May God reward you I will learn Show me what to do
Simon took yarn put it round his thumb and began to twist it
It is easy enoughsee
Michael watched him put some yarn round his own thumb in the same way
caught the knack and twisted the yarn also
Then Simon showed him how to wax the thread This also Michael mastered
Next Simon showed him how to twist the bristle in and how to sew and
this too Michael learned at once
Whatever Simon showed him he understood at once and after three days he
worked as if he had sewn boots all his life He worked without stopping
and ate little When work was over he sat silently looking upwards
He hardly went into the street spoke only when necessary and neither
joked nor laughed They never saw him smile except that first evening
when Matryona gave them supper
VI
Day by day and week by week the year went round Michael lived and
worked with Simon His fame spread till people said that no one sewed
boots so neatly and strongly as Simons workman Michael and from all
the district round people came to Simon for their boots and he began to
be well off
One winter day as Simon and Michael sat working a carriage on
sledgerunners with three horses and with bells drove up to the hut
They looked out of the window the carriage stopped at their door a
fine servant jumped down from the box and opened the door A gentleman
in a fur coat got out and walked up to Simons hut Up jumped Matryona
and opened the door wide The gentleman stooped to enter the hut and
when he drew himself up again his head nearly reached the ceiling and
he seemed quite to fill his end of the room
Simon rose bowed and looked at the gentleman with astonishment He had
never seen any one like him Simon himself was lean Michael was thin
and Matryona was dry as a bone but this man was like some one from
another world redfaced burly with a neck like a bulls and looking
altogether as if he were cast in iron
The gentleman puffed threw off his fur coat sat down on the bench and
said Which of you is the master bootmaker
I am your Excellency said Simon coming forward
Then the gentleman shouted to his lad Hey Fedka bring the leather
The servant ran in bringing a parcel The gentleman took the parcel and
put it on the table
Untie it said he The lad untied it
The gentleman pointed to the leather
Look here shoemaker said he do you see this leather
Yes your honor
But do you know what sort of leather it is
Simon felt the leather and said It is good leather
Good indeed Why you fool you never saw such leather before in your
life Its German and cost twenty roubles
Simon was frightened and said Where should I ever see leather like
that
Just so Now can you make it into boots for me
Yes your Excellency I can
Then the gentleman shouted at him You can can you Well remember
whom you are to make them for and what the leather is You must make me
boots that will wear for a year neither losing shape nor coming unsown
If you can do it take the leather and cut it up but if you cant say
so I warn you now if your boots become unsewn or lose shape within a
year I will have you put in prison If they dont burst or lose shape
for a year I will pay you ten roubles for your work
Simon was frightened and did not know what to say He glanced at
Michael and nudging him with his elbow whispered Shall I take the
work
Michael nodded his head as if to say Yes take it
Simon did as Michael advised and undertook to make boots that would not
lose shape or split for a whole year
Calling his servant the gentleman told him to pull the boot off his
left leg which he stretched out
Take my measure said he
Simon stitched a paper measure seventeen inches long smoothed it out
knelt down wiped his hand well on his apron so as not to soil the
gentlemans sock and began to measure He measured the sole and round
the instep and began to measure the calf of the leg but the paper was
too short The calf of the leg was as thick as a beam
Mind you dont make it too tight in the leg
Simon stitched on another strip of paper The gentleman twitched his
toes about in his sock looking round at those in the hut and as he did
so he noticed Michael
Whom have you there asked he
That is my workman He will sew the boots
Mind said the gentleman to Michael remember to make them so that
they will last me a year
Simon also looked at Michael and saw that Michael was not looking at
the gentleman but was gazing into the corner behind the gentleman as
if he saw some one there Michael looked and looked and suddenly he
smiled and his face became brighter
What are you grinning at you fool thundered the gentleman You had
better look to it that the boots are ready in time
They shall be ready in good time said Michael
Mind it is so said the gentleman and he put on his boots and his fur
coat wrapped the latter round him and went to the door But he forgot
to stoop and struck his head against the lintel
He swore and rubbed his head Then he took his seat in the carriage and
drove away
When he had gone Simon said Theres a figure of a man for you You
could not kill him with a mallet He almost knocked out the lintel but
little harm it did him
And Matryona said Living as he does how should he not grow strong
Death itself cant touch such a rock as that
VII
Then Simon said to Michael Well we have taken the work but we must
see we dont get into trouble over it The leather is dear and the
gentleman hottempered We must make no mistakes Come your eye is
truer and your hands have become nimbler than mine so you take this
measure and cut out the boots I will finish off the sewing of the
vamps
Michael did as he was told He took the leather spread it out on the
table folded it in two took a knife and began to cut out
Matryona came and watched him cutting and was surprised to see how
he was doing it Matryona was accustomed to seeing boots made and she
looked and saw that Michael was not cutting the leather for boots but
was cutting it round
She wished to say something but she thought to herself Perhaps I do
not understand how gentlemans boots should be made I suppose Michael
knows more about itand I wont interfere
When Michael had cut up the leather he took a thread and began to sew
not with two ends as boots are sewn but with a single end as for soft
slippers
Again Matryona wondered but again she did not interfere Michael sewed
on steadily till noon Then Simon rose for dinner looked around and
saw that Michael had made slippers out of the gentlemans leather
Ah groaned Simon and he thought How is it that Michael who has
been with me a whole year and never made a mistake before should do
such a dreadful thing The gentleman ordered high boots welted with
whole fronts and Michael has made soft slippers with single soles and
has wasted the leather What am I to say to the gentleman I can never
replace leather such as this
And he said to Michael What are you doing friend You have ruined me
You know the gentleman ordered high boots but see what you have made
Hardly had he begun to rebuke Michael when rattat went the iron ring
that hung at the door Some one was knocking They looked out of the
window a man had come on horseback and was fastening his horse They
opened the door and the servant who had been with the gentleman came
in
Good day said he
Good day replied Simon What can we do for you
My mistress has sent me about the boots
What about the boots
Why my master no longer needs them He is dead
Is it possible
He did not live to get home after leaving you but died in the
carriage When we reached home and the servants came to help him alight
he rolled over like a sack He was dead already and so stiff that
he could hardly be got out of the carriage My mistress sent me here
saying Tell the bootmaker that the gentleman who ordered boots of him
and left the leather for them no longer needs the boots but that he
must quickly make soft slippers for the corpse Wait till they are
ready and bring them back with you That is why I have come
Michael gathered up the remnants of the leather rolled them up took
the soft slippers he had made slapped them together wiped them down
with his apron and handed them and the roll of leather to the servant
who took them and said Goodbye masters and good day to you
VIII
Another year passed and another and Michael was now living his sixth
year with Simon He lived as before He went nowhere only spoke when
necessary and had only smiled twice in all those yearsonce when
Matryona gave him food and a second time when the gentleman was in
their hut Simon was more than pleased with his workman He never now
asked him where he came from and only feared lest Michael should go
away
They were all at home one day Matryona was putting iron pots in the
oven the children were running along the benches and looking out of the
window Simon was sewing at one window and Michael was fastening on a
heel at the other
One of the boys ran along the bench to Michael leant on his shoulder
and looked out of the window
Look Uncle Michael There is a lady with little girls She seems to be
coming here And one of the girls is lame
When the boy said that Michael dropped his work turned to the window
and looked out into the street
Simon was surprised Michael never used to look out into the street
but now he pressed against the window staring at something Simon also
looked out and saw that a welldressed woman was really coming to
his hut leading by the hand two little girls in fur coats and woolen
shawls The girls could hardly be told one from the other except that
one of them was crippled in her left leg and walked with a limp
The woman stepped into the porch and entered the passage Feeling about
for the entrance she found the latch which she lifted and opened the
door She let the two girls go in first and followed them into the hut
Good day good folk
Pray come in said Simon What can we do for you
The woman sat down by the table The two little girls pressed close to
her knees afraid of the people in the hut
I want leather shoes made for these two little girls for spring
We can do that We never have made such small shoes but we can make
them either welted or turnover shoes linen lined My man Michael is
a master at the work
Simon glanced at Michael and saw that he had left his work and was
sitting with his eyes fixed on the little girls Simon was surprised
It was true the girls were pretty with black eyes plump and
rosycheeked and they wore nice kerchiefs and fur coats but still
Simon could not understand why Michael should look at them like
thatjust as if he had known them before He was puzzled but went on
talking with the woman and arranging the price Having fixed it he
prepared the measure The woman lifted the lame girl on to her lap and
said Take two measures from this little girl Make one shoe for the
lame foot and three for the sound one They both have the same size
feet They are twins
Simon took the measure and speaking of the lame girl said How did it
happen to her She is such a pretty girl Was she born so
No her mother crushed her leg
Then Matryona joined in She wondered who this woman was and whose the
children were so she said Are not you their mother then
No my good woman I am neither their mother nor any relation to them
They were quite strangers to me but I adopted them
They are not your children and yet you are so fond of them
How can I help being fond of them I fed them both at my own breasts
I had a child of my own but God took him I was not so fond of him as I
now am of them
Then whose children are they
IX
The woman having begun talking told them the whole story
It is about six years since their parents died both in one week their
father was buried on the Tuesday and their mother died on the Friday
These orphans were born three days after their fathers death and their
mother did not live another day My husband and I were then living as
peasants in the village We were neighbors of theirs our yard being
next to theirs Their father was a lonely man a woodcutter in the
forest When felling trees one day they let one fall on him It fell
across his body and crushed his bowels out They hardly got him home
before his soul went to God and that same week his wife gave birth to
twinsthese little girls She was poor and alone she had no one
young or old with her Alone she gave them birth and alone she met her
death
The next morning I went to see her but when I entered the hut she
poor thing was already stark and cold In dying she had rolled on to
this child and crushed her leg The village folk came to the hut washed
the body laid her out made a coffin and buried her They were good
folk The babies were left alone What was to be done with them I
was the only woman there who had a baby at the time I was nursing my
