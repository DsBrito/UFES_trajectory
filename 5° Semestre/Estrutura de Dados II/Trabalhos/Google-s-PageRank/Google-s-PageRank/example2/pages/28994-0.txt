1 It is natural that the Roman system should make its way more
rapidly into use in this country than in Europe not because
Americans are more given to experiments but because here in the
United States the inconveniences of having no standard system have
been more sharply felt New England being wholly settled from Old
England long continued the English system of pronouncing Latin In
the Middle States the Germans and Dutch introduced their own
methods in the South and West the French pronunciation came in
quite frequently and all over the Union the Catholic clergy in
their schools and colleges have propagated the traditional usage of
their Church Hence a Babel of pronunciations and systems existing
and practised side by side in a picturesque confusion such as no
European country ever knew and hence the general willingness to
accept a single method especially one that is based upon historic
truth
II
SOURCES OF OUR INFORMATION
A QUESTION of much interest to the student of Latin and one that
does not always receive a satisfactory answer relates to the sources
of our information
What knowledge have we of how the Romans pronounced their own
language nineteen hundred years ago How is it possible after so long
an interval to reconstruct the laws of a pronunciation which
prevailed at a given period of the remote past
Briefly summarized the sources of our information are six in number
1 Statements of the Roman writers themselves which modern
scholarship has laboriously collected These are of different degrees
of explicitness and of different degrees of value It is evident
that a statement of Cicero however brief is more trustworthy and
more convincing with regard to the usage of his own time than whole
pages of testimony in a writer like Priscian who wrote in the sixth
century by which period the language had become corrupt
We may then broadly divide the ancient authorities on this subject
into two groupsthe first consisting of those writers who
themselves belonged to the classical age the second of those
grammarians and commentators who have left us very full statements
though the date at which they wrote somewhat impairs the value of
their testimony
The chief classical authorities to whom appeal can be made are M
Terentius Varro a contemporary of Cicero whose treatise on the
Latin language has in part come down to us Cicero himself from
whose rhetorical works one can gather many valuable facts and M
Fabius Quintilianus the author of the treatise Institutio
Oratorio in twelve books It is not merely when these authors speak
of definite points of language and pronunciation that they are
valuable sometimes a casual remark an anecdote or a pun may be of
very great importance as will be seen from time to time in the
following pages
Of the other writers on language who treat the subject very minutely
a great number might be cited 1 The most important are Terentianus
Maurus who wrote perhaps about the third century a poem on
letters syllables feet and metres which is twice quoted by St
Augustine Verrius Flaccus the tutor to the grandchildren of the
Emperor Augustus and author of a work on the meaning of words which
has come down to us in a later abridgment Aulus Gellius who toward
the end of the second century compiled a huge scrapbook on a
variety of subjects many of them of great linguistic interest and
with the exception of a few chapters still extant Priscianus
Caesariensis who wrote under Justinian at Constantinople eighteen
books of grammatical commentaries which form the most complete
grammar of antiquity and Aelius Donatus AD 333 whose elementary
treatise was so highly thought of in the Middle Ages that the name
donat Chaucer was used as a generic term for a grammar
From these and many other writers one gathers a great mass of
instructive facts and their very silence is sometimes as significant
as what they say
2 The orthography of the language itself as seen in the
inscriptions Latin orthography was in the main phonetic Quintilian
I 7 11 The language was pronounced as it was spelled But as is
always the case changes in orthography lagged a little behind
changes in the pronunciation Hence even the blunders made by an
ignorant lapidary in cutting an inscription are often a source of
information to us
3 The representation in Greek letters of Roman sounds A number
of Greek writers treated of Roman history Roman biography and Roman
geography In so doing they were obliged to represent many Latin
names and words in Greek characters But many of these writers had no
particular knowledge of the Latin language and hence spelled these
Latin names and words phonetically Their method of doing this is
both interesting and instructive The writers of this sort who are
oftenest cited are Polybius BC 175 the friend of the younger
Scipio and the author of a General History of Rome from the Second
Punic War down to the conquest of Macedonia Strabo the geographer
24 BC Diodorus Siculus the contemporary of Julius Caesar and
author of an Historical Library in forty books and Plutarch AD
80 the best known of the Greek writers on Roman subjects 2
4 A critical comparison of all the modern languages of Europe that
are derived from the Latin Italian French Spanish Portuguese
with reference to those points wherein they all agree This source of
information is of less importance than one would think because these
languages are not derived directly from the classical Latin but from
Latin that was either provincial or modified by foreign influences
Still this comparison is useful in corroborating facts that are
elsewhere learned and is of positive value when not contradicted by
other evidence
5 The traditions of scholars and especially of the Roman
Catholic Church which in its rites has employed Latin continuously
from the first century down to the present time The rhymes of the
early Christian hymns also have a bearing on this subject
6 The general principles of the science of phonology which are
now well established and understood and are of great value in
detecting erroneous assumptions which would otherwise pass
unchallenged
From these six sources can be gained a very accurate understanding of
how Latin was pronounced in the days of Cicero and Caesar It is not
too much to claim that the system of pronunciation upon which
scholars are now agreed differs less from that of the Romans of the
Augustan Age than does our modern pronunciation of English differ
from that of Shakespeare and his contemporaries
It is not always remembered that only very gradually was the true
pronunciation of Latin lost in Europe Scholars long retained the
essential features of it and by the fact of their constant
intercourse long prevented the growth of local and national
variations from the established method Great teachers like Erasmus
passed from country to country lecturing in Latin at the
universities of Italy Germany Holland Trance and England
teaching pupils of all nationalities and being everywhere understood
without any difficulty for Latin was the lingua franca of the
educated and one general pronunciation of it prevailed Even in
England it was only after that countrys isolation political and
religious in the sixteenth century that an English pronunciation
arose and this was long protested against eg by Cardinal Wolsey
by Milton and as late as the last century by Ainsworth 1746 and
Philipps 1750 For the Continental traditions see Justus Lipsius
in his Dialogus de Recta Pronunciatione Linguae Latinae and
Erasmus De Recta Latini Graecique Sermonis Pronunciatione Basic
1528 In Scotland the Continental sound of the vowels was long
retained on which see the incident imagined by Sir Walter Scott in
his novel The Fortunes of Nigel ch ix
1 Schneider in his Elementarlehre der Lateinischen Sprache cites
more than fifty ancient authors Besides those mentioned above
reference is often made to Velius Longus Servius Marius Victorinus
Macrobius and Martianus Capella
2 Others are Josephus the Jewish historian Dionysius of
Halicarnassus Appian and Dio Cassiusthe last a Roman who wrote
in Greek
III
THE LATIN ALPHABET
IN its earliest form the Latin alphabet consisted of 21 characters
A B C D E F Z H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X These
letters were derived from the alphabet used by the Dorian Greeks of
Campania At a very early period the letters K and Z fell into
disuse although K continued to occur in a few ancient abbreviations
such as Kal for Kalendae K S for carus suis K K for
calumniae causa a legal phrase KK for castrorum KA for
capitalis and the use of Z was subsequently revived in
transliterating Greek words Originally the character C had the
sound which was afterwards given to G but when K was abandoned C
took its place and its sound while a new letter G was formed by
slightly changing the original C Plutarch says that the character G
was first employed by Spurius Carvilius about the year 230 BC In
Ciceros time the letter Y was introduced to represent the sound of
the Greek I but its presence in a word always marks a foreign
origin so that the character can scarcely be regarded as an
essential part of the Roman alphabet About the year AD 44 the
Emperor Claudius tried to introduce three new symbols into the
alphabet 1 the inverted diagamma Picture inverted diagamma to
mark the consonantal sound of V 2 the character known as
antisigma Picture Antisigma to express the sound denoted by
the Greek I ps or bs and 3 the sign Picture a Latin
form of upsilon which was to have the sound of the Greek I
ie of modern French u or German A14 It may be mentioned also
that consonants were not doubled in writing Latin until the practice
was adopted from the Greek by Ennius BC 239169 who in various
ways conformed Roman usages to those of the Greeks
The Roman alphabet like the early alphabet of the Greeks lacked
distinctive characters for the long and short vowels This defect
which was partly corrected in Greek by the adoption of the letters
I and I traditionally ascribed to Epicharmus of Syracuse BC
500 was never fully remedied in Latin though at different times
various devices were employed to distinguish between A and A A and
A A and A A and A These were
1 The doubling of the vowel when long as in modern Dutch thus
vootum  votum aara  Ara This method was persistently used
by the poet Attius 1
2 By the use of a species of accent apex over the long vowel
This became quite general in the Augustan Age
3 The length of the vowel A was denoted sometimes by making it
longer than the other letters and sometimes by writing it ei thus
DICO PVEREI
The Roman numerals V X L C D M originated in various ways 2
V represented originally the open palm with the thumb extended just
as our 0 zero is thought to represent a closed hand
X perhaps  Picture old form of theta an old form of I
according to others it is merely two Vs placed together
L  Picture alternate form of chi  Picture another alternate
form of chi or I a Greek letter which the Romans did not need in
their alphabet and hence used only as a numeral
C  Picture alternate form of theta another form of I  and
confounded with C as though standing for centum
M  I becoming first CIantisigma and then M as though standing
for mille D is one half of this figure or Iantisigma 3
1 Quintilian I 7 14 When i is doubled it always denotes the
consonantal i j eg maiior

IV
SOUNDS OF THE LETTERS
1 A A had the sound of a in English far A had the sound of
a in English trespass
There is no disagreement of opinion regarding the proper
pronunciation of Latin a All the modern languages derived from the
Latin practically agree in the sounds which they give to this
character Furthermore its pronunciation is described for us by
Terentianus Maurus p 328 in the edition by Keil by Marius
Victorinus p 32 in the edition of the same editor and also by
Martianus Capella III 261
NOTEIt must be remembered in the pronunciation of the Latin
vowels that the short vowel does not differ in quality from the
corresponding long one but only in quantity ie it occupied less
time in pronouncing This is an important distinction between Latin
and English
2 B had in general the sound of English b but before s or
t the sound of p
a The ordinary sound of Latin b is described for us by
Martianus Capella III 261 and by Marius Victorinus p 32 Keil
b That it was sounded like p when it stood before s we know
because very often in inscriptions it is so written eg pleps for
plebs Araps for Arabs urps for urbs In certain verbs this
usage has modified the common orthography eg scripsi for
scribsi from scribo and opseguor for obsequor And so before
t as we learn both by the spelling of certain words optulit
scriptum and from the statement of Quintilian I 7 7 When I
pronounce the word obtinuit our rule of writing requires that the
second letter should be b but the ear catches the sound of p
3 C always had the sound of English k
The facts upon which this statement is founded are as follows
a The pronunciation of this letter is so described for us by
Martianus Capella III 261 as to prove it a hard palatal
b C took the place of an original k in the early alphabet as
previously stated and in succeeding ages at times c reappears in
inscriptions indifferently before the various vowels Thus we have
the form Caelius alternating with Kaelius Cerus with Kerus
and decembres with dekembresshowing that c and k were
identical in sound Quintilian I 7 10 says As regards k I
think it should not be used in any wordsThis remark I have not
failed to make for the reason that there are some who think k
necessary when a follows though there is the letter C which has
the same power before all vowels
c In the Greek transliteration of Latin names Latin c is
always represented by k and in Latin transliteration of Greek
names k is always represented by Latin c And we know that Greek
k was never assibilated before any vowel Suidas calls the C on the
Roman senators shoes the Roman kappa
d Words taken into Gothic and Old High German from the Latin at
an early period invariably represent Latin c by k thus Latin
carcer gives the Gothic karkara and the German Kerker Latin
Caesar gives the German Kaiser Latin lucerna gives the Gothic
lukarn the Latin cellarium gives the German Keller the Latin
cerasus gives the German Kirsche Also in late Hebrew Latin c
is regularly represented in transliteration by the hard consonant
kA ph
Advocates of the English system claim that Latin c had the sound
of s before e or i because every modern language derived from
the Latin has in some way modified c when thus used It is true
that modern languages have so modified it but as already noted the
modern languages are the children not of the classical Latin spoken
in the days of Cicero but of the provincial Latin spoken five or six
centuries later There is no doubt that at this late period Latin
c had become modified before e or i so as to be equivalent to
s or z Latin words received into German at this time represent
c before e or i by z But had this modification been a part
of the usage of the classical language it would have been noticed by
the grammarians who discuss each letter with great minuteness Now
no grammarian ever mentions more than one sound for Latin c Again
if Latin c had ever had the sound of s surely some of the
Greeks ignorant of Latin and spelling by ear would at least
occasionally have represented Latin c by Ia thing which none
of them has ever done It is probable that the modification of c
which is noticed in the modern languages was a characteristic of the
Umbrian and Oscan dialects and so prevailed to some extent in the
provinces but there is absolutely not the slightest evidence to show
that it formed a part of the pronunciation of cultivated men at
Rome
4 D had regularly the sound of English d but at the end of
words nearly that of t
a The position of the vocal organs in uttering this letter is
described by Terentianus Maurus p 331 Keil Marius Victorinus p
33 and Martianus Capella III 261
b That final d was sounded like t is clear from the positive
statements of Quintilian and from the fact that in inscriptions as
well as in the best manuscripts of Plautus and Vergil we find almost
indifferently ad and at apud and aput haud and haut
quid and quit as well as adque and atque and many others
At about the fourth century AD di before a vowel began to be
pronounced somewhat like the French j just as in Aeolic Greek we
find II for I I1I Hence in the modern languages g and j arise
out of Latin di Compare Latin diurnus with the Italian giorno
and the French jour
5 E A had the sound of English e in they or of the French
Aa A had the sound of English e in net
a The position of the vocal organs in pronouncing e is
described by Terentianus Maurus p 329 Keil Marius Victorinus p
32 and Martianus Capella III 261 It is regularly represented in
Greek transliterations by I when short and by I when long
b The sound of the letter e seems to have varied more than was
the case with other vowels The later grammarians give to A a sound
approximating to the sound of i Cf Donatus in Servius p 421
Keil 1 And confusion of A and A in words like timidus
navibos written timedus navebos is to be seen in early
Latin But too much importance has been given to this The fact is
that one short unaccented vowel is very likely to be mistaken for
another especially by the uneducated and by careless speakers The
hearer cannot detect the difference and in fact there is none
practically The extremely accurate and discriminating elocution of
which we hear was in all probability confined to the highly
cultivated classes
6 F had practically the sound of English f
Latin f is not like the Greek I which was a double sound rather
than a single one namely p  h with each element distinctly
audible as in English topheavy uphill Quintilian says The
Greeks are accustomed to aspirate whence Cicero in his oration for
Fundanius ridicules a witness who could not sound the first letter of
that name 2 The descriptions given by Priscian and Terentianus
Maurus of the position of the lips and teeth in pronouncing f show
that it was formed precisely as our f ie with the lower lip
against the upper teeth
7 G g always had the hard sound of English g in get
a When g comes before an s it produces x thus showing
that it is a guttural eg lex  leg  s and rex  reg
s
b No Roman grammarian mentions more than one sound as belonging
to g although they treat of the letters minutely
c All the vowels readily interchange after g in the same root
which would hardly be the case if g had had more than one sound
Thus we have maligenus and malignus lego legis legit
gigeno and gigno tegimen and tegmen
d Latin g is invariably represented by Greek I3 and the Greek
I3 is invariably represented by Latin g St Augustine remarks
When I say lege a Greek understands one thing and a Roman another
in these two syllables This shows that Latin lege and Greek
III3I had precisely the same sound
About the fifth century AD g began to have the soft sound
before e and i that is now found in the modern languages The
first change from the old hard sound was to a y sound like that
given to g by those who speak the Berliner Dialekt in Germany
today and said to be found also in Lowland Scotch Such variations
as magestas for maiestas and in Greek I2II1II12II1 for viginti
occur
8 H had the sound of English h
a H is described as a simple breathing by Marius Victorinus p
34 Keil Terentianus Maurus p 331 and Martianus Capella III
261 It is represented in Greek by the rough breathing and in turn
it represents that breathing
b There seems to have existed among the uneducated Romans that
irregularity in the use of h which marks the language of the
English cockney today Nigidius Figulus the grammarian said Your
speech becomes boorish if you aspirate wrongly Catullus in one of
his epigrams ridicules the cockneyism of a person who said chommoda
for commoda and hinsidiae for insidiae 3 In later Latin
the varying spelling shows the growing irregularity of usage H
seems to have been omitted or inserted almost at pleasure thus
hauctoritas hii and hinventio stand beside inospita
omini homini and abitat habitat The reason for this
irregularity seems to have been the gradual weakening of the sound
until h became a silent letter as it is in modern Spanish and
Italian 4
9 I consonant J had the sound of English y
a That i had a consonant sound as distinct from its vowel sound
is clear from the statement of Priscian I p 13 Keil Before a
vowel and not preceded by an accented syllable with final consonant
he says that i passes over to the force of a consonant That it
differs from i the vowel is also clear from the fact that in
prosody it lengthens the preceding vowel
b That it was not like English j is clear from the fact that it
readily passes into i which proves the two sounds to have been
closely akin and in Greek transliterations it is always represented
by I1 Thus Julius  IIIII1II
c Nigidius Figulus cautioned his readers that the
i j in such words as iam iecur iocus is not a vowela
caution that would have been absurdly unnecessary if i had had any
such sound as that of English j
d The true sound of the letter is seen in the alternative
spelling Eanus for Janus proposed by some of the ancients who
derived the name from eo ire About 300 AD the letter got the
sound of z or gi
10 I vowel A as in English machine A as in English
din
a Martianus Capella says I is a breathing with the teeth nearly
closed
b It is represented in Greek by I1
c All the derived modern languages give i this sound
In the vulgar language and the sermo rusticus A seems to have
varied with A and to have been confused with it So Augustus Caesar
said heri for here and we find sibe for sibi Cf Cic de
Orat III 12 46 Quint I 7 Aulus Gellius X 24 Also a
confusion appears between A and A as in the forms optumus and
optimus lubet and libet But we are only concerned with the
normal sound of the letter which is that given above
11 L had the sound of English l
It is always represented in Greek by I The position of the vocal
organs in uttering it is described by Marius Victorinus p 34
Martianus Capella III 261 says L grows soft upon the tongue and
palate
For l as a corruption of r see 17 b
12 M had the sound of English m but was much weakened at the
end of words
The fact that m was weakly sounded at the end of words is shown by
the elision of a final m before an initial vowel in poetry
synaloepha by the fact that in the early inscriptions it is often
omitted in writing and by the positive statements of the Roman
writers themselves 5 Because at the end of a word before a
following vowel it was practically a silent letter Verrius Flaccus
wished to represent it in that position by a different character
Picture alternate form of M
Quintilian XII 10 31 says We close many of our words with the
letter m which has a sound something like the lowing of an ox and
in which no Greek word terminates Priscian remarks M sounds
obscurely at the end of words
13 N usually had the sound of the English n but before c
q g or x the sound of the English ng in linger
This n before a guttural and technically known as a guttural
nasal was called n adulterinum so according to Varro the
early Roman writers in such cases wrote it as a g thus agceps
for anceps agyulus for angulus and so on after the fashion
of the Greeks
14 O A practically had the sound of o in English note A
like o in English not
The A is regularly represented in Greek by I and the A by
Greek I Marius Victorinus p 33 Keil says that o is produced
with the lips extended and the tongue quiescent in the middle of the
mouth Martianus Capella III 261 says O is produced by breathing
through the mouth made round The character O is in fact believed
to have been originally a pictorial representation of a rounded
mouth
15 P always had the sound of English p
The position of the vocal organs in uttering p is described by
Martianus Capella III 261 It is always represented in Greek by
I
16 Q is always followed by u and had the sound of qu in
English queen
b Q represents the old Greek letter koppa and is a sharp
guttural mute Colloquially qu may have been carelessly sounded
like k or like qu in modern French A candidate for office whose
father had been a cook once approached Cicero and asked a bystander
for his vote whereupon Cicero who was an inveterate punster said
Ego quoque tibi iure favebo pronouncing quoque kokA so as to
suggest coque the vocative of coquus a cook Quint VI 3
47
17 R in general had the sound of the English r with a slight
trill ie that of the Italian r
a Because of its snarling sound it is called by the satirist
Persius the dogs letter littera canina
b The Romans seem not to have liked a too frequent repetition of
this letter for it is omitted often when a following syllable
contains it as pejero for perjero and grammarians have noticed
that the genitive plural of the future participle is of rare
occurrence In the colloquial and provincial Latin r is often
dulled into l Thus on one of the walls at Pompeii a part of the
first line of the Aeneid was found written ALMA VILVMQVE CANO
TLOa rendering which might have been produced by a modern Chinese
Cf the playful use of Hillus for Hirrus in one of Ciceros letters
ad Fam ii 10 1
18 S had regularly the sound of the English initial s sharp as
in sip at the end of words it was barely audible
a That s was a sharp hiss is clear from the fact that it
maintains its place before the sharp consonants as in sto spes
squama scelus and does not maintain its place before flat
consonants as in cano casno iudex iusdex dilabor
dislabor diripio disripio trado transdo viden
videsne while it regularly changes a preceding flat consonant to
a sharp as scripsi scribsi and rexi regsi
b That it was very lightly sounded at the end of words is clear
from the fact that until after Ciceros time it was neglected in
scanning when the next word began with a consonant that in the early
inscriptions it is frequently omitted in writing as Cornelio for
Cornelios and that in a great number of words it fell away
altogether at all periods of the language as in ipse for ipsus
pote for potis vigil for vigilis puer for puerus and
compare such forms as poeta nauta and luxuria with III1IIII
I12IIIII luxuries and so in modern Italian
The neglect of final s in scanning is extremely frequent Cf such
a line as this hexameter from Ennius where the s is suppressed
three times
Tum lateralis dolor certissimus nuntius mortis
19 T had the sound of English t always hard
a The English system of pronouncing Latin gives to ti the sound
of sh before a vowel as in the words militia oratio An
assibilation was undoubtedly a characteristic of the Umbrian and
Oscan dialects at an early period and fastened itself upon the Latin
after the sixth century AD for Isidores states that tia should
be sounded zia and in Greek transliterations of the sixth century
we find such forms as I II12III1II12II14 for donationem and a14IoIII1I for
actio Pompeius says that whensoever a vowel follows ti or di
the ti or di becomes sibilant So again on Christian epitaphs we
find Constantso for Constantio etc But in the classical period
of the language there is no reason for thinking that this
assibilation existed for the Greek transliterations of that period
invariably denote Latin ti by II1 as Ia12IIII12Ia12I for Valentia It
is this classical tradition which Servius retains when he lays it
down as a rule that in all cases di and ti are to be pronounced
exactly as written 7
b At the end of a word the letter t seems to have been less
strongly sounded for we find such forms as ama apu for amat
