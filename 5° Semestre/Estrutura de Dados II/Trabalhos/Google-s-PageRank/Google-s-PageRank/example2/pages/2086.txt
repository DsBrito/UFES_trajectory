knew of these tastes of course and so Hesters presents were nearly
always history books or portraits of great men such as Napoleon and
Shakespeare both of whom she almost worshipped while Roberts were
compasses and maps He also had a mapmeasurer from Mr Lenox and at
the moment at which this story opens his birthday being just over he
was the possessor of a pedometer which he carried fastened to his leg
under his knickerbockers so that it was certain to register every time
he took a step He kept a careful record of the distance he had walked
since his birthday and could tell you at any time what it was if you
gave him a minute or two to crawl under the table and undo his clothes
He could be heard grunting in dark places all day long having been
forbidden by Janet to undress in public
Roberts birthday was on June 20 Hesters on November 8 and Janets
on February 28 She had the narrowest escape you see of getting
birthdays only once in every four years which is one of the worst
things that can happen to a human being Gregory Bruce was a little
less lucky for his birthday was on December 20 which is so near to
Christmas Day that mean persons have been known to make one gift do for
both events None the less Gregorys possessions were very numerous
for he had many friends and most of them were careful to keep these
two great anniversaries apart
Gregorys particular passion just now was the names of engines of
which he had one of the finest collections in Europe but a model
aeroplane which Mr Scott had given him was beginning to turn his
thoughts towards the conquest of the air and whereas he used to tell
people that he meant to be an engine driver when he grew up he was now
adding or a man like Wilbur Wright
Most children have wanted to fly ever since Peter Pan began and as
I dare say you have heard some have tried from the nursery window
with perfectly awful results having neglected to have their shoulders
first touched magically but Gregory Bruce Avory wanted to fly in a
more regular and scientific manner He wanted to fly like an engineer
To his mind indeed the flying part of Peter Pan was the least
fascinating he preferred the underground home and the fight with the
Indians and the mechanism of the crocodile For a short time in fact
his only ambition had been to be the crocodiles front half
Janet on the other hand liked Nana and the pathetic motherly parts
the best Roberts favourite was Smee and often at meal times he used
to say Woe is me I have no knife while Hester was happiest in the
lagoon scene This difference of taste in one small family shows how
important it is for anyone who writes a play to put a lot of variety
into it
Janet the eldest was also the most practical She was in fact
towards the others almost more of a younger mother than an elder
sister Not that Mrs Avory neglected them at all but Janet relieved
her of many little duties She always knew when their feet were likely
to be wet and Robert had once said that she had stocking changing on
the brain She could cook too especially cakes and the tradesmen
had a great respect for her judgment when she went shopping She knew
when a joint would be too fat and you should see her pointing out the
bone
Janet was a tall girl and very active and in spite of her
responsibilities very jolly She played hockey as well almost as a
boy which is of course saying everything and her cricket was good
too Her bowling was fast and straight and usually too much for
Robert who knew however the initials of all the gentlemen and the
Christian names and birthplaces of most of the professionals Gregory
could not bear cricket except when it was his own innings which he
seemed to enjoy during its brief duration Hester thought it dull
throughout so that Janet had to depend upon Robert and the Rotherams
for the best games
Janet had very straight fair hair and just enough freckles to be
pretty She looked nicest in blue Hester on the contrary was a dark
little thing whose best frock was always red
As for the boysit doesnt matter what boys are like but Gregory I
might say usually had black hands not because he was naturally a
grubby little beast but because engineers do Robert on the contrary
was disposed to be dressy and he declined to allow his mother or Janet
to buy his socks or neckties without first consulting him as to colours
Among the friends of the family must be put first Uncle Chris who was
Captain Avorys brother and a lawyer in Golden Square Uncle Chris
looked after Mrs Avorys money and gave advice He was very nice and
came to dinner every Sunday hot roast beef and horse radish sauce
There was an Aunt Chris too but she was an invalid and could not
leave her room where she lay all the time and remembered birthdays
Next to Uncle Chris came Mr Scott who was a famous author and a very
good cricketer on the lawn and Mr Lenox who was private secretary to
a real lord and therefore had lots of time and money Both Mr Scott
and Mr Lenox were bachelors as the best friends of families always
are unless of course their wives are invalids
Gregory who was more social than Robert also knew one policeman one
coachman three chauffeurs and several Chiswick boatmen extremely
intimately Roberts principal friend outside the family was a bird
stuffer in Hammersmith but he does not come into this story
The Avories did not go to boarding school or indeed to any school in
the ordinary way at all Mrs Avory said she could not spare them
Instead they were visited every day except Saturdays by Mr Crawley and
Miss Bingham who taught them the things that one is supposed to
knowMr Crawley taking the boys in the old billiard room and Miss
Bingham the girls in the morning room At some of the lessonssuch as
historythey all joined The classes were attended also by the
Rotherams the doctors children who lived at Fir Grove and Horace
Campbell the only son of the vicar So it was a kind of school after
all
Horace Campbell had always intended to be a cowboy when he grew up but
a visit to a play called Raffles was now rather inclining him to
gentlemanly burglary William Rotheram like Gregory leaned towards
flying but Jack Rotheram voted steadily for the sea and talked of
little but Osborne
Mary Rotheram played with a bat almost as straight as Plum Warners
and she knew most of the old Somersetshire songsMowing the Barley
and Lord Rendal and Seventeen come Sundayby heart and sang them
beautifully Gregory who used to revel in Sankeys hymns as sung by
Eliza Pollard the parlourmaid now thought that the Somerset music was
the only real kind Mary Rotheram had a snub nose and quantities of
freckle and a very nice nature
The Gables had a large garden with a shrubbery of evergreens in it
and a cedar It was not at all a gardenparty garden because there was
a wellworn cricketpitch right in the middle of the lawn and Gregory
had a railway system where the best flowers ought to be but it was a
garden full of fun and old Kink the gardener managed to get a great
many vegetables out of it too although not so many as Collins thought
he ought to
Collins was the cook a fat smiling hot lady of about fifty who had
been with Mrs Avory ever since she married Collins understood
children thoroughly and made cakes that were rather wet underneath
Her Yorkshire pudding for Sundays dinner was famous and her horse
radish sauce was so perfect that it brought tears to the eyes
Collins collected picture postcards and adored the family She had
never been cross to any of them but her way with the butchers boy and
the grocers boy and the fishmongers boy was terrible
She snapped their heads off so to speak every morning and old Kink
spent quite a lot of his time in rubbing from off the backdoor the
awful things they wrote about her in chalk
The parlourmaid was Eliza Pollard who had red hair and a kind heart
but was continually falling out with her last young man and getting
another She told Hester all about it Hester had a special knack of
being told about the servants young men for she knew also all about
those of Eliza Pollards predecessors
The housemaid was Jane Masters who helped Eliza Pollard to make the
beds Jane Masters did not hold with fickleness in lovein fact she
couldnt abide itand therefore she was steadily true to a young man
called Erb who looked after the lift at the Stores and was a
particular friend of Gregorys in consequence No man who had charge of
a lift could fail to be admired by Gregory
Finallyand very likely she ought to have come firstwas Runcie or
Mrs Runciman who had not only been the nurse of all the Avories but
of Mrs Avory before them when Mrs Avory was a slip of a girl named
Janet Easton Runcie was then quite young herself and why she was
suddenly called Mrs no one ever quite knew for she had never married
And now she was getting on for sixty and had not much to do except
sympathize with the Avories and reprove the servants She had a nice
sitting room of her own where she sat comfortably every afternoon when
such work as she did was done and received visits from her pets as
she called the children none of whom however was quite so dear to
her as their mother and listened to their adventures
On those evenings on which he came to The Gables Mr Lenox always
looked in on her for a little gossip and this was called his runcible
spoonthe joke being that Mr Lenox and Runcie were engaged to be
married
And now you know the Avory family root and branch
CHAPTER 2
THE SOUND OF MYSTERIOUS WHEELS
One day in late June the Avories and the Rotherams and Horace Campbell
were sitting at tea under the cedar talking about a great tragedy that
had befallen For Mrs Avory had just heard that Mrs Dudeneytheir
regular landlady at Sea View in the Isle of Wight where they had
lodgings every summer for years and years and where they were all
ready to go next month as usualMrs Avory had just heard that Mrs
Dudeney had been taken very ill and no other rooms were to be had
Here was a blow For the Rotherams always went to Sea View too and had
a tent on the little strip of beach under the wood adjoining the
Avories and they did everything together And now it was very likely
that the Avories would not get lodgings at all and certainly would not
get any half so good as Mrs Dudeneys where their ways were known
and their bathing dresses were always dried at once in case they wanted
to go in again and so on
They were all discussing this together and saying what a shame it was
when suddenly the unfamiliar sound of the opening of the old stableyard
gates was heard and then heavy wheels scrunched in and mens voices
called out directions such as Steady Joe A little bit to the
near side Bill and so forth
Now since the stable yard had not been used for years it was no
wonder that the whole party was so to speak on tiptoe longing to run
and investigate But Mrs Avory had always objected very strongly to
inquisitiveness and so they stayed where they were and waited
expectantly And then after a minute or so Kink came up to the table
with a twinkle in his old eye and a letter in his old hand
Didnt we hear the sound of a carriage Mrs Avory asked
Did you mum said old Kink who was a great tease
Im sure there were wheels said Mrs Avory
Kink said nothing
Of course there were wheels said Robert Dont be such an old
humbug
But Kink only twinkled
Its only coals said Gregory isnt it
The first Ive heard of coals said Kink
Kinky dear said Janet is it something awfully exciting
Nothing very exciting about a house that I know of Miss Janet said
Kink
A house cried Janet It couldnt have been a house
Theres all sorts of houses said Kink theres houses on the ground
and theres houses on
O Kinky cried Hester I know
And she clapped her hands and absolutely screamed I know Its a
caravan
A caravan the children shouted together and with one movement they
dashed off to see
Old Kink laughed and Mrs Avory laughed
Its a caravan right enough he said And a very pretty one too and
none of they nasty gypsies in it neither
But where does it come from Mrs Avory asked and in reply Kink
handed her the letter but she had done no more than open it when Janet
ran back to drag her to see the wonderful sight
Gregory I need hardly say was already on the box with the whip in his
hand while all the others were inside except Horace Campbell who had
climbed on the roof and was telephoning down the chimney The men and
horse that had brought it were gone
Oh mother cried Hester whose is it Is it ours
I expect the letter tells us everything said Mrs Avory and
sitting on the top of the steps she unfolded the letter and after
looking through read it aloud
This is what it said
DEAR CHILDREN
It has long been my wish to give you a new kind of present but I have
hitherto had no luck I thought once of an elephant and even wrote to
Jamrach about the ideaa small elephant not a mountainbut I gave
that up Chiswick is too crowded and your garden is too small But now
I think I have found the very thing A caravan It belonged to a lady
artist who having to live abroad wished to sell it and it is now
yours I tell you this so that mother need not be afraid that it is
dirty It should reach you this week and can stand in the old coach
house until you are ready to set forth on the discovery of your native
land I should have liked also to have added a horse and a man but you
must do that and keep an account of what everything costs and let me
know when I come back from abroad I shall expect some day a long
account of your adventures and if you keep a logbook so much the
better
I am
Your true if unsettling friend
X
PSYou will find a use for the enclosed key sooner or later and if
you want to write to me address the letter to X care of Smithurst
and Wynn Lincolns Inn Fields WC
For a while after the letter was finished the Avories were too excited
and thoughtful to speak while as for the Rotherams and Horace
Campbell however they may have tried they could not disguise an
expression if not exactly of envy certainly of disappointment There
was no X in their family
May we really go away in it and discover England Robert asked
I suppose so said Mrs Avory
Then that makes Sea View all right said Gregory Because this will
do instead
The poor Rotherams Sea View had suddenly become tame and almost
tiresome
Mrs Avory saw their regrets in their faces and cheered them up by the
remark that the caravan must sometimes be lent to others
Oh yes said Janet
Do you think Dr Rotheram would let you go she asked Mary
Of course he would said Jack But I wish it was a houseboat
The suggestion was so idiotic that everyone fell on him in scorn
But who is X Mrs Avory asked
The letter was written in a round office hand that told nothing Mr
Scott was the most likely person but why should Mr Scott hide He
never had done such a thing Or Mr Lenox But neither was it his way
to be secret and mysterious Nor was it Uncle Christophers
When however you have a caravan given you and it is standing there
waiting to be explored the question who gave it or did not give it
becomes unimportant
Gregory put the case in a nutshell Never mind about old X now he
said Lets make a thorough examination
CHAPTER 3
THE THOROUGH EXAMINATION
It was a real caravan That is to say either gypsies might have lived
in it or anyone that did live in it would soon be properly gipsified
It was painted in gay colours and had little white blinds with very
neat waists and red sashes round them That is the right kind of
caravan The brown caravans highly varnished are wrong they may be
more luxurious but no gypsy would look at them
The body of it was greena good apple greenand the panels were lined
with blue Some people say that blue and green wont go together but
dont let us take any notice of them Just look at the bed of
forgetmenots or a copse of bluebells or for that matter try to
see the Avories caravan The window frames and bars were white The
spokes and hubs of the wheels were red It was most awfully gay
Insidebut the inside of a caravan is so exciting that I hardly know
how to hold my pen The inside of a caravan Can you imagine a better
phrase than that I cant If Coleridges statement is true that poetry
is the best words in the best order then that is the best poem the
inside of a caravan
The caravan was sixteen feet six inches long and six feet two inches
high inside From the ground it stood ten feet It was six feet four
inches wide If you measure these distances in the dining room you
will see how big it was and you will be able to imagine yourselves in
it
The woodwork was all highly varnished and very new and clean More
than halfway down the caravan were heavy curtains hanging across it
and behind these was the bedroom containing four beds two on each
wall on hinged shelves that could be let down flat against the
wallby day when the folding chairs could be unfolded and the bedroom
then became a little boudoir
The floor space was however filled this afternoon with great bundles
which turned out to be gypsy tents and sleeping sacks For the boys
and Kink to sleep in said Janet but we must be very careful about
waterproof sheeting on the ground first
The rest of the caravan between the door and the bedroomabout ten
feetwas the kitchen and living room Here every inch of the wall was
used either by chairs that folded back like those in the corridors of
railway carriages or by shelves racks cupboards or pegs There were
two tables which also folded to the wall
The stove was close to the door but of course no one who lives in a
caravan ever uses the stove except when it is raining You make the
fire out of doors at all other times and swing the pot from three
sticks Hedgehog stew Cant you smell it There were kitchen
utensils on hooks and racks on each side of the stove which was covered
in with shining brass and rows of enameled cups and saucers and
plates and knives and forks The living room floor was covered with
linoleum the bedroom floor had a carpet Swinging candlesticks were
screwed into the wall here and there It was more like the cabin of a
ship than anything on land could ever be and Jack Rotheram began to
weaken towards it
In course of time other things were discovered showing what a thorough
person X was A large India rubber bath for instance and a bath
sheet to go under it A Beatrice oil stove and oil An electric torch
for sudden requirements at night A teabasket for picnics Quantities
of cartoil A piece of pumice stone very thoughtful There was also
a box of little India rubber pads with tintacks the use for which not
discovered till later was to prevent the rattling of the furniture by
making it fit a little better And in one of the cupboards was a bottle
of camphor pills and a tin of tobacco labeled For Tramps and Gypsies
There was even a bookshelf with books on it Hans Andersen The
Arabian Nights Lavengro Inquire Within Mrs Beeton
Bradshaw rather cowardly Robert thought and The Blue Poetry
Book There was also The Whole Art of Caravaning with certain
passages marked in pencil such as this
We pull up to measure the breadth of the gate and if it be broad
enough send forward an ambassador to the farm who shall explain that
we would fain camp here that we are not gypsies vagabonds or
suspicious characters that we will leave all as we find it and will
not rob or wantonly destroy And in case of need he shall delicately
hint that we may incidentally provide good custom in butter eggs
milk and half a dozen other things Our ambassador must also if it be
possible secure a stall for the horse
And this useful reminder
We must have water near at hand and a farm within reasonable distance
and we should look for shelter from prevailing winds We must avoid
soft ground and it is a mistake to camp in long grass unless the
weather be particularly dry We should be as far as possible from the
road if there is much traffic upon it It is great advantage if there
is a stream or lake at hand for bathing An old pasture field sloping
away from the road will often satisfy our requirements in lowlying
districts And up among the moors we shall be content to take a piece
of level ground where we can find it There will be nothing to disturb
us there
And this excellent caravan poem
I love the gentle office of the cook
The cheerful stove the placid twilight hour
When with the tender fragrance of the flower
And all the bubbling voices of the brook
The coy potato or the onion browns
The tender steak takes on a nobler hue
I ponder mid the falling of the dew
And watch the lapwings circling oer the downs
Like portals at the pathway of the moon
Two trees stand forth in pencilled silhouette
Against the steelgrey sky as black as jet
The steak is ready Ah too soon too soon
So much with one exception for the inside of the caravan Underneath
it were still other things for a box with perforated sides swung
between the wheels and this was the larger always cool and shady
except as Janet remarked on dusty days and near it on hooks were a
hanging saucepan a great kettle two pails and two market baskets a
nose bag and a skid Close by was a place for oats and chaff
A new set of harness was packed on the box and it was so complete that
on each of the little brass ornaments that hang on the horses chest
was the letter A On the back of the caravan was a shelf that might
be let down making a kind of sideboard for outdoor meals
For two or three days the caravan did nothing but hold receptions
Everyone who knew the Avories came to see iteven Roberts bird
stuffer who said he would like to borrow it for a weeks holiday in
Epping Forest and observe Nature through its windows Several of
Gregorys intimates also examined it and approved Miss Bingham
pronounced it elegant and commodious and Mr Crawley who like all
schoolmasters and tutors made too many puns said that its probable
rate of speed reminded him of his name Collins wished she might never
have to cook in it but otherwise was very tolerant Eliza Pollard said
that her choice would be a motor car and Jane Masters brought Erb
back on Sunday afternoon and they examined it together and decided
that with such a home as that they might be married at once
I have left till the last the most exciting thing of all In an
enclosure you remember was a key concerning the purpose of which
nothing was said in the letter Well in the course of the exploration
of the caravan which went on for some days always yielding a fresh
discovery Robert came upon a box securely fastened to the floor in a
dark corner
Mother mother he cried wheres that key Ive found a mysterious
keyhole
They all hurried to the stable yard to see and Robert swiftly inserted
the key and turned it He fell back too much overcome to speak The
box contained twentyfive new sovereigns
CHAPTER 4
THE ITEMS
Mr Lenox either knew everything or knew someone who knew everything
so that he was always certain to be able to help in any difficulty
Mrs Avory wrote to him to come round and consult with her about it
and he was there at tea time
A caravan he said after she had finished Ripping Nothing better
Yes said Mrs Avory but
Oh well said Mr Lenox thats all right A few little bothers
but soon over He checked them off on his finger Itemas your old
Swan of Avon Hester would sayitem a driver
I was thinking of Kink said Mrs Avory but theres the garden
Yes said Mr Lenox and theres also Kink Do you think hed go
The best thing to do is to ask him said Mrs Avory Gregory just
run and bring Kink in
Kink soon appeared fresh from the soil
Would you be willing to drive the caravan if we decided to use it
Mrs Avory asked
If cried the children Steady on mother If
Kink who was a great tease pretended to think for quite a long time
until his silence had driven the children nearly desperate Yes he
then said I should mum provided you let me find a trustworthy man
to go on with the garden Otherwise I shouldnt dare to face Mrs
Collins when I came back
Thats very kind of you Kink said Mrs Avory
Good old Kinky said Gregory
Yes said Mr Lenox And now for item two The horse How would you
go to work to get a horse Kink
Well said Kink thats a little out of my way A horse radish yes
but not a horse
Everyone laughed the old man expected it
Then said Mr Lenox with a mock sigh I suppose the horse will
have to be found by me We dont want to buy oneonly to hire it
Dont lets have a horse said Gregory lets have a motor I think
a motor caravan would be splendid
There youre quite wrong said Mr Lenox The lifeblood of a
caravan is sloth the lifeblood of a motor is speed You cant mix
them And how could Robert here survey England creditably if he rushed
through it in a motor Youre going to survey England arent you
Bobbie No it must be a horse and I will get it I will make friends
with cabmen and coachmen and grooms and stableboys I will carry a
straw in my mouth I will get a horse to do you credit What colour
would you like
White said Janet
It shall be a white horse said Mr Lenox And now he added the
way is cleared for item three Can you guess what that is
They all tried to guess but could not They were too excited
A dog said Mr Lenox
Oh yes they cried
To guard the caravan at night and when we are away said Janet
Exactly said Mr Lenox And what kind of a dog
A dachshund said Hester
Too small said Mr Lenox
A St Bernard said Robert
Too mild said Mr Lenox
A spaniel said Janet
Too gentle said Mr Lenox
A foxterrier said Gregory
Not strong enough said Mr Lenox I leave it to Mr Lenox said
Mrs Avory
Very well then said Mr Lenox a retrievera retriever because
it is big and formidable and also because when tied up it will
always be on the watch Well buy the Exchange and Mart and look
up retrievers We cant hire a dog we must buy outright there Now
then Bobbie item four
Maps said Bobbie
Right said Mr Lenox I wish I was coming with you
Do they all cried
I cant said Mr Lenox If I were to go away before September I
should get the sack and then I should starve His Lordship is
sufficiently cross with me now because I had to give him out
legbefore at the annual estate match last Saturday when I was
umpiring He couldnt stand anything else
That night Mrs Avory Uncle Christopher Mr Scott and Mr Lenox were
talking after dinner
Its a very wonderful present said Mrs Avory but there are two
things about it that are not quite satisfactory One is that one likes
to know where such gifts come from and the other is that for a party
of children to go away alone with only Kink is a great
responsibility Thats a word which mothers are very fond of
Suppose theyre ill
Its a risk you must take said Uncle Chris Dont anticipate
trouble
Because Mrs Avory went on I should not go with them although I
might arrange to meet them here and there on their journey They would
like me to be with them I know and they would like to be without me
I know
I shouldnt worry about the giver of the present said Mr Scott
You have many friends from whom you would have no objection to accept
a caravan and theres no harm in one of those friends wishing to be
anonymous As for the other matter I dont see much risk so long as
Kink goes too Hes a careful and very capable old sport and Janets
as good a mother as you any day
Mrs Avory laughed Yes I know that she said But what about
gypsies and tramps
One has always got to take a few chances said Uncle Christopher
They may get things stolen now and then from the outside of the
caravan but I should doubt if anything else happened Kink and a good
dog would see to that And Janet would see to the children keeping dry
or getting dry quickly after rain and so forth Such an experience as
a fortnight in a caravan of their own should be a splendid thing for
all of them Gregory for exampleits quite time that he studied the
A B C of engineering and began where James Watt began instead of
merely profiting by the efforts of all the investigators since then I
mean its quite time he watched a kettle boil and Hester would get no
harm by mixing a little washingup with her Romeo and Juliet
woolgathering
I think youre right said Mrs Avory and Im sure they are very
unlikely to get any such experience here But I shall be very nervous
No you wont said Mr Lenox because well arrange that you shall
