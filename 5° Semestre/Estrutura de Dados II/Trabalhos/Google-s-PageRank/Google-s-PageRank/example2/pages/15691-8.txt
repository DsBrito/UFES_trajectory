WOMAN IN MODERN SOCIETY
I
What it Means to be a Woman
If we go back to the earliest forms of life where the unit is simply a
minute mass of protoplasm surrounded by a cell wall we find each of
these divisions to be a complete individual It can feed itself that
its life may go on today it can fight or run away that it may be here
to fight tomorrow and by a process of division it can create a new
life so that its existence may continue across the generations With
such units it is quite conceivable that life might go on through all
eternity death following birth were it not that protoplasm contains
within itself a principle of change Life and change are synonymous
And this change moves ever toward a complexity which we call
development where cells unite in a larger life and functions and
organs are specialized Thus there comes a time when the part split off
carries with it power to eat and digest to fight or run away but only
half the power of procreation This half unit this incomplete
individual is either male or female and from this time on the epic of
life gathers around the search of these halflives for their
complements The force that impels to this search while at first
valuable only for the perpetuation of the generations gathers into
itself modifying feeling and desires and at a later period ideas and
ideals which finally when men and women appear make it the greatest
of all the shaping forces in life1
1 The fact that sexual selection does not play the part in organic
evolution which Darwin assigned it does not affect this statement See
chapter on Sexual Selection in YVES DELAGEE and MARIE GOLDSMITH The
Theories of Evolution New York Huebsch 1912
Of course in such a sweeping statement as this one must include under
sex hunger all the forces that drive men and women to seek each others
society rather than that of their own sex In this sense it can be
truly said that it gives a motive for our care of offspring and for
all our other most selfforgetful devotions our finest altruisms our
most polished expressions in language manners and dress It justifies
labor ambition and at times even selfeffacement It underlies nearly
all the lyric expressions in art furnishes almost the only theme for
that delineation of modern life which we call the novel and is a main
support for music painting statuary and belleslettres It gives us
the institution of the family which is the parent of the state it is
closely allied to religion and in our individual lives it lifts us to
the heights of selfrealization and happiness or plunges us down to the
depths of degradation and tragedy
While this sex hunger belongs equally to men and women it has come to
be associated with women until we even speak of them as the sex
Hence when we are discussing women we are generally discussing the sex
interest common to both men and women and this disturbs our point of
view The fact is that sex interest is a common possession that the
unit in human life even more than among lower animals is always a male
and a female bound together by love Just as a body can function in
sleep or under the influence of a narcotic for a time seemingly
independent of the mind so a man or a woman can live for a time in
seeming independence of the opposite sex but from any biological point
of view such a separate existence of male and female is only a
transient effort The halflife must find its mate or after a few brief
days it dies leaving its line extinct For all the larger purposes of
life man is but a halfcreature and woman is equally a fragment
It is of course conceivable that these two halves of the biological
unit might have been made or might have developed alike in everything
except the sexual function At least they might have been as much alike
as men are alike They might have been of the same size possessed of
the same strength of the same figures and gestures complexion and
hair Their voices might have been alike They might have had the same
kinds of nervous systems with the same desires feelings ideas and
tendencies In the assertions and arguments born of intellectual
industrial social and political readjustments it is often assumed
that this is the case Differences are minimized or denied and an
attempt is made to resolve the world of men and women into a world of
human beings capable of living together in mingled competitions and
cooperations regardless of sex except where the reproductive process
is considered But this view is superficial born of argument it breaks
down when confronted by any body of significant facts
Again it has happened that in the long struggle of developing
civilization sometimes one and sometimes the other sex has gained what
has seemed an advantage over the other just as in the development of
any mans individual life his brain may gain a seeming advantage over
his stomach so that it has more than its fair share of nourishment and
activity Arguing from such a case we might declare the brain superior
to the stomach in power health and function but in the long
accounting all such temporary superiorities are wiped out So with men
and women seeming advantages for either are gained only at the expense
of the common life and in the last analysis each finds his individual
value only in the common life of the unit
Let us try then to see what the special characteristics of women are
ignoring as far as possible the accidental variations of individuals
and the temporary advantages or disadvantages due to economic or
ideational forces and all assertions of what would be if things were
not as they are
While the whole matter of sex differences is in a state of unsettlement
it seems very certain that males are more active and more variable than
females This superabundant vitality appears in the males of the higher
animals in secondary sex characteristics such as more abundant and
unnecessary hair and feathers tusks spurs antlers wattles brilliant
colors and scent pouches It also appears in mating calls songs and
general carriage of the body Correspondingly the female is smaller
duller colored and less immediately attractive than the male
All the studies that have been made on men and women also confirm our
ordinary observation that men are taller heavier stronger and more
active than women and this holds true in all stages of civilization
wherever tests have been made In strength rapidity of movement and
rate of fatigue Miss Thompsons studies2 show that men have a very
decided advantage over women Thus in strength tests the men in Yale
have double the power of women in Oberlin3 while our college athletic
records place men far ahead of women in all events requiring strength
and endurance

The differences in structure between men and women are such as to
correspond with the functional differences just stated A womans bones
are smaller in proportion to her size than are those of a man The body
is longer the hips broader and the abdomen more prominent Relatively
to the length of the body the arms legs feet and hands are shorter
than in men the lower leg and arm are shorter in proportion to the
upper leg and arm Man has the long levers and the active frame One has
only to look at two good statues of a man and a woman to realize the
greater strength and activity of the man
Woman as she actually appears in modern society is also less subject
to variation than man4 she is much less liable to be a genius or an
idiot than her brother5 She offers greater resistance to disease
endures pain and want more stoically and lives longer so that while
more boys than girls are born in all parts of the world where
statistics are kept in mature years women always outnumber men
4 KARL PEARSON denies this See The Chances of Death Vol I p
256 London 1897
5 CW SALEEBY in Woman and Womanhood p 54 New York Mitchell
Kennerley 1911 maintains that woman is biologically more variable than
man and that womans less variable activity is due to her training
All these statements are summed up by saying that not only in women but
in most female animals of the higher orders life is more anabolic than
in males They tend to more static conditions they collect organize
conserve they are patient and stable they move about less they more
easily lay on adipose tissue Compared with the female the male animal
is katabolic he is active impulsive destructive skilful creative
intense spasmodic violent Such a generalization as this must not be
pushed too far in its applications to our daily life but as a statement
of basal differences it seems justified by ordinary observation as well
as by scientific tests6
6 PATRICK GEDDES and ARTHUR THOMPSON in The Evolution of Sex D
Appleton  Co 1889 first advanced this position
Meantime it is probably true that the female as mother of the race is
more important biologically than the male since she both furnishes germ
plasm and nourishes the newly conceived life The latest studies along
lines laid down by Mendel seem to indicate that the female brings to
the new creation both male and female attributes while the male brings
only male qualities Thus when either sex sinks into insignificance as
sometimes happens in lower forms of life it is generally the male which
exists merely for purposes of reproduction7

The differences in the nervous systems of men and women are now fairly
established on the quantitative side Marshall has shown that if we
compare brain weight with the stature in the two sexes there is a slight
preponderance of cerebrum in males but if the other parts of the brain
are taken into consideration the sexes are equal8 Havelock Ellis has
carefully gathered the results of many investigators and declares that
womans brain is slightly superior to mans in proportion to her
size9 But these quantitative differences are now felt to have
comparatively little significance and of the relative qualities of the
brain substance in the two sexes we know nothing positively In fact if
we give a scientist a section of brain substance he cannot tell whether
it is the brain of a man or a woman
8 MARSHALL Journal of Anatomy and Physiology July 1892
9 HAVELOCK ELLIS Man and Woman p 97 Contemporary Science Series
It is very probable that the average womans mind is capable of much the
same activity as the average mans mind given the same heredity and the
same training They are both alike capable of remarkable feats of
imitation and an ordinarily intelligent man could probably learn to
wear womans clothes and walk as she generally walks so as to deceive
even a jury of women if there were a motive to justify the effort
Women also can perform and they do perform most of the feats of men
At the same time it is desirable to note present differences in modes of
thinking and feeling for while they may have been produced by
environment and ideals and may hence give way to education they must
be reckoned with in making the next steps In the chapter on education
we shall discuss certain academic peculiarities of womens minds but
here we are interested in seeing what fundamental differences
characterize the thinking of the sexes
Women seem more subject to emotional states than men10 and this
general observation agrees with the fact that the basal ganglia of the
brain are more developed in women than in men and these parts of the
brain seem most intimately concerned with emotional activity Whether
emotion follows acts or leads to acts remains a disputed question but
certainly emotion gives charm and significance to life and distinguishes
modes of thinking Particularly in the dramatic art this quality of
mind gives women special excellence The fact that she more often
appeals to emotion than to reason as cause for action in no way marks
her as inferior to man but simply as different As Ellen Key says
There is nothing more futile than to try to prove the inferiority of
woman to man unless it be to try to prove her equality11

11 ELLEN KEY Love and Ethics p 52 New York Huebsch 1911
Most women think in particulars as compared with men The individual
circumstance seems to them very important and it is hard for them to
get away from the concrete On the other hand a mans thinking is more
impersonal and general and he is more easily drawn into abstractions
It is true that womans domestic life would naturally develop this
quality but we are not now concerned with the question of origins Most
women find it easy to live from day to day the man is more given to
systematizing and planning Thus in offices men are more efficient as
heads of departments while women handle details admirably In public
life we have recently seen thousands of women eager to depose a United
States Senator accused of polygamy without regard to the bearing of
the concrete act on constitutional guarantees Women have done little
with abstract studies like metaphysics they have done much with the
novel where ideas are presented in the concrete and particular
This habit of dealing with particulars and disinclination for
abstraction leads easily to habitual action It is easy for women to
stock up their lower nerve centers with reflex actions This of course
goes along with the general anabolic characteristics of the sex Hence
women are the conservers of traditions rules of conducting social
intercourse appeal to them and they are the final supporters of
theological dogmas12 Women naturally uphold caste and Daughters of
the Revolution and Colonial Dames flourish on the scantiest foundations
of ancestral excellence Man on the other hand is more radical and
creative He has perfected most of our inventions he has painted our
great pictures carved our great statues he has written music while
women have interpreted it
12 HELEN B THOMPSON Psychological Norms in Men and Women p 171
University of Chicago Press 1903
Along with these fixed qualities of action women have a tendency to
indirection when they advance We say they have diplomacy tact and
coquetry while man is more direct and bald in his methods Of course
one easily understands how these qualities may have arisen since fraud
is the force of weak natures and woman has always been driven to
supplement her weakness with tact from the days of Jael and Delilah
down to the present day adventuress
These qualities of mind naturally drive women to literary interests
which are concrete personal and emotional Men turn more easily than
women to the abstract generalizations of science Of course there are
marked exceptions to these general statements in both sexes Madame
Curie who was recently a candidate for the honors of the French
Academy and who in 1911 was given the Nobel prize for her
distinguished services to chemistry is but one of many women who are
famous today in the world of science Still the private life of these
women as in the case of Sonya Kovalevsky seems to bear out our general
conclusion Men on the other hand as milliners and editors of ladies
journals show marked skill in catering to womens tastes but on the
whole the differences indicated seem important and widely diffused
Another profound difference between men and women is the womans greater
tendency to periodicity in all her functions and adjustments to
life13 In all normal societies the life of the man is fairly regular
and constant from birth to old age He moves along lines mainly
predetermined by his heredity and his environment his habits and his
work Even puberty is less disturbing in its effect upon a boy than upon
a girl and often by eighteen we can anticipate the life of a young man
with great accuracy The one element in his life hardest to forecast is
the effect of his loveaffairs
13 See chapter on Periodicity in G STANLEY HALLS Adolescence Vol
I p 472
With a woman it is quite different As a girl the period of puberty
produces profound changes and after that for more than thirty years
she passes through periodical exaltations and depressions that must play
a large part in determining her health happiness and efficiency In the
forties comes another great change which affects her life to a degree
strangely ignored by those who have dealt with her possibilities in the
past14
14 KARIN MICHAELIS The Dangerous Age John Lane Co 1911 is said
to have sold 80000 in six weeks when it first appeared in Berlin The
Bride of the Mistletoe by JAMES LANE ALLEN Macmillan deals with the
same period
But the great element of uncertainty always fronting the girl and young
woman is marriage Marriage for her generally means abandonment of old
working interests and a substitution of new it brings her geographical
change new acquaintances and friendships and the steady adjustment of
her personal life to the man she has married in its relation to
industry religion society and the arts If children come to her they
must inevitably retire her from public life for a time with the danger
of losing connections which comes to all who temporarily drop out of the
race
A boy industrious observant with some power of administration
studies mining engineering moves to a mining center and expresses his
individual and social powers along the lines of his work until he is
sixty The women who impinge against his life may deflect him from the
mines in California to those in Australia or from the actual work of
superintendence to an office or from an interest in Browning to
Tennyson or from Methodism to Christian Science The girl with
industrious and observant interests studies stenography and
typewriting moves to the vicinity of offices but is then caught up in
the life of a farmerhusband who shifts her center of activity to a farm
in Idaho where she must devote herself to entirely different activities
form new associations think in new terms respond to new emotions and
adjust herself to her farmerhusbands personality When after
twentyfive years she has reared a family of children and when
improved circumstances enable them to move up to the county seat she
confronts many of the conditions for which she originally prepared
herself but with farm habits diminishing adaptability and diminishing
power of appealing to her husband His powers are still comparatively
unimpaired and as a dealer in farm produce or farm machinery his
interests undergo slight change In general it may be said that a
womans life falls into three great periods of twentyfive years each
The first twentyfive years of childhood and girlhood is a time of
getting ready for the puzzling combination of her personal needs as a
human being her needs as a selfsupporting social unit and her
probabilities of matrimony The second twentyfive years the domestic
period of her life is a time of adjustments as wife and mother which
may instead prove to be a period of barren waiting or a time of
professional and industrial selfdirection and selfsupport The third
twentyfive years is a time of mature and ripened powers of lessened
romantic interests and if the preceding period has been devoted to
husband and children it is often a time of social detachment of
weakened individual initiative of oldfashioned knowledge of
inefficiency of premature retirement and old age
On the moral side as Professor Thomas has so admirably pointed
out15 women have evolved a morality of the person and of the family
while men have evolved a morality of the group and of property Since
men have had a monopoly of property and of lawmaking they have shaped
laws mainly for the protection of property and in a secondary degree
for the protection of the person Under these laws a man who beats
another nearly to death is less severely punished than one who signs the
wrong name to a check for five dollars Mans katabolic nature and his
greater freedom have given him almost a monopoly of crime under these
laws which he has made Offences against the coming generation against
health social efficiency and good taste have until recently been left
to the tribunal of public opinion as expressed in social usage and
here as we have seen women are generally the judges and executioners
In this her own field of moral judgment woman is idealistic and
uncompromising If one of her sisters falls from virtue she will often
pursue her unmercifully If a man on the other hand commits a burglary
or forgery her sympathy and mercy may make her a very lenient judge
15 WILLIAM I THOMAS Sex and Society p 149 University of Chicago
Press 1907 ELLEN KEY in Love and Marriage GP Putnams Sons
1911 traces the same lines of growth
In sthetics the differences follow the same general law Women express
beauty in themselves jewels are for their ornament and rooms are
furnished as a setting for themselves The lives of millions of workers
go to the adornment of women In painting they sometimes excel but a
Madame Le Brun does her best work when she paints herself and her child
and when Angelica Kauffmann would paint a vestal virgin she drapes a
veil over her own head and transfers her features to the canvas
Sculpture and architecture are too impersonal and abstract to attract
much attention from women at present Even a sculptor like Mrs Bessie
Potter Vonnoh finds her truest theme in statuettes of mothers with their
children about them
During the past few years psychologists have paid great attention to
secondary sex characteristics of the mind and doubtless many qualities
of the thought and feeling of men and women owe their origin to the same
source as brilliant plumage antlers combs and wattles Thus the shy
retiring reticent selfeffacing languishing adoring excesses of
maidenhood and the peculiar psychological manifestations of the late
forties must probably be understood from this point of view So also
must the bold swaggering assertive compelling bearing of youth be
interpreted The shy or modish dandified lackadaisical canecarrying
youth is naturally disliked as a sexual perversion
Women alone whether individually or in groups tend to develop certain
hard dry arid qualities of mind and heart or they become emotional
and unbalanced Losing a sense of large significances they become
overcareful saving sometimes penurious while in matters of feeling
they lavish sentiment and sympathy on unimportant pets and movements
Men when alone become selfish coarse and reckless their judgments
become extravagant and their pursuits remorseless
Thus it is certainly true that men and women supplement each other in
the subjective as in the objective life Man creates woman conserves
man composes woman interprets man generalizes woman particularizes
man seeks beauty woman embodies beauty man thinks more than he feels
woman feels more than she thinks For new spiritual birth as for
physical birth men and women must supplement each other
To be a woman then is to be for twentyfive years a girl and then a
young woman capable of feeding and protecting herself possessed of
preparing and conserving powers superior to her brothers After that
for twentyfive years she is a human being primarily devoted to
romanticism finding her largest fulfilment only in wifehood and
motherhood direct or vicarious in the last twentyfive years she
should be a wise woman of ripe experience carrying over her gathered
training and powers to the service of the group All this time she is
like the man an incomplete creature realizing her greatest power and
her greatest service only when working in loving association with the
man of her choice
II
Womans Heritage
So thoroughly have modern men fastened their attention upon the problems
of the immediate present that one feels driven to justify oneself in
taking up an historical investigation of any subject presented in a
popular manner And yet it takes little argument to show that what we
shall be depends in large measure on what we are and that what we are
rests back on what we have been In anything we try to think or feel or
do we quickly reach a limit and this limit is determined by the
original quality of our nervous system plus the training it has
received For here is the curious fact about this instrument of thought
and feeling which at once takes it away from comparison with mechanical
instruments Whatever it does becomes a part of itself and then helps
to determine what it will do the next time and how it will do it With
the making easy of mental operations through repetition and with the
formation of associations based on our choices it may be truly said
that we become whatever we habitually think and feel and do
Every choice we make is thus literally built into our character and
becomes a part of ourselves After that the old choice will help
determine the new and we shall find ourselves being directed by all of
our past choices and even by the choices of our ancestors Since then
all our earlier selves are continued in us and make us what we are we
are simply studying ourselves when we study the history of our
ancestors If we would go forward we must first look backward for we
must rise on steppingstones of our dead selves
But history is not merely the story of the past To relate that would
take as long as it took to live it and the result would be but
weariness of spirit History to be significant must select the events
with which it will deal it must arrange these in series that are in
accord with the constitution of things and then it must use the
generalizations it reaches to interpret the present and even to
forecast the future It is obvious that this interpretation will depend
on the point of view held by the interpreter
Hence we must ask in what fundamental beliefs this presentation rests
These are first that life tends to move along certain lines that
constitute the law of human nature Just as the infant tends first to
wriggle then creep then walk then run and dance so human nature
tends to move upward from savagery through primitive settled life to the
complex forms of larger settled units In this progress material or
economic forces play a large part but ideas originally born out of
circumstances but sometimes borrowed from other people sometimes
degenerate remnants of past utilities also play a large part The
progress we finally make is thus directed by this human tendency by
material circumstances and by ideas Sometimes it keeps pretty closely
to what seems to us to be upward human growth sometimes it stagnates
sometimes it gives us perverted products and sometimes it destroys
itself
Thus it becomes necessary to trace the past experiences of woman that we
may see with what heritage she faces the future She is all that she
has felt and thought and done She started with at least half of the
destiny of the race in her keeping Handicapped in size and agility and
periodically weighted down by the burdens of maternity she still
possessed charms and was mistress of pleasures which made her for
savage man the dearest possession next to food and for civilized man
the companion joy and inspiration of his days
Of womans position in early savage times we know only what we can learn
from fragmentary prehistoric remains from the structure of early
languages from records of travelers and students among savages of more
recent times or what can be inferred from human nature in general Most
of this data is difficult to interpret but it is probable that womans
position was not much worse than mans It is a bad beast that fouls its
own food or its own nest and the female had always the protection of
the males desire If she could not entirely control her body she could
still control her own expressions of affection and desire and without
these mere possession lost much of its charm
As keeper of the cave cultivator of the soil and guardian of the
child woman rather than her more footloose mate probably became the
center of the earliest civilization The jealousy of men formed tribal
rules for her protection and to these religion early gave its powerful
sanctions Thus there came a day when the woman took her mate home to
her tribe and gave her children her own name Even if the matriarchal
period was not so important as has sometimes been assumed woman
certainly had large influence over tribal affairs in early savage life
With the increase in population and the consequent disappearance of
game man was forced to turn his attention to the crude agriculture
which woman had begun to develop The superior qualities which he had
acquired in war and the chase enabled him slowly to improve on these
beginnings and to shape a body of custom which made settled society
possible With mans leadership in the family the patriarchal form of
government developed and mans power over woman was sanctioned by
custom and law The woman was stolen or bought and while sexual
attraction did not play the continuous part which it plays in developed
society it must have done much to protect women from abuse and neglect
at least during the years of girlhood and childbearing It is at this
point that our historical records begin
In the pages of Homer or of the Old Testament in Tacituss Germania
or in the writings of Livy we find womans position well defined True
she stands second to the man but she is his assistant not his slave
She must be courted and while marriage presents are exchanged she is
not bought In times of emergency she steps to the front and
legislates judges or fights It is possible in the pages of the Old
Testament to find women doing everything which men can do Even where
the power is not nominally in her own hands she often as in the cases
of Penelope or Esther rules by indirection Her body and her offspring
are protected and the Hebrew woman of the Proverbs shows us a
singularly free and secure industrial position16 Such was the
condition in primitive Judea in early Greece in republican Rome or
among the Germans who invaded southern Europe in the third and fourth
centuries of our era
16 Proverbs xxxi 10
Mans jealousy of his woman as a source of pleasure and honor to
himself and to his family must have always acted to limit womans
freedom even while it gave her protection and a secure position in
society With the development of settled government in city states like
Athens or early Rome the necessity for defining citizenship made the
family increasingly a political institution A mans offspring through
slave women concubines or strangers lived outside the citizen group
and so were negligible but the citizen womans children were citizens
and so she became a jealously guarded political institution The
established family became the test of civic military and property
rights The regulations limiting the freedom of girls and women were
jealously enforced since mismating might open the treasures of
citizenship to any low born or foreign adventurer17

In the ancient Orient in Greece Rome and in later Europe these
stages have been repeated again and again Woman is first a slave
stolen or bought protected by sexual interest to which is later added
social custom and religious sanction Early civilization centers around
the woman so that she becomes in some degree the center of the
homestaying group In primitive civilization man takes over womans
most important activities but she gains a fixed position protected
though still further enslaved by political necessities
But with the increase of wealth whether in terms of money slaves or
trade woman found herself subject to a fourth form of enslavement more
subtly dangerous than brute force lust or political and religious
institutionalism This was the desire of man to protect her and make her
happy because he loved her He put golden chains about her neck and
bracelets on her arms clothed her in silks and satins fed her with
dainty fare gave her a retinue of attendants to spare her fatigue and
put her in the safest rear rooms of the habitation But it is foolish to
talk of conscious enslavement in this connection Rich men and luxurious
