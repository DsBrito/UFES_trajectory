land that he called his own and left together with immense sums of
money to his son subject only to a jointure for his wife It is hard
to blame the tired old man if he felt even with the homily ringing in
his ears that he had not played his part in the world badly
Millstead Manor was indeed the sort of place to raise a doubt as to the
utter vanity of riches It was situated hard by the little village of
Millstead that lies some forty miles or so northwest of London in the
middle of rich country The neighborhood afforded shooting fishing and
hunting if not the best of their kind yet good enough to satisfy
reasonable people The park was large and well wooded the house had
insisted on remaining picturesque in spite of Mr Lanes improvements
and by virtue of an indelible stamp of antiquity had carried its point
A house that dates from Elizabeth is not to be entirely put to shame by
one or two unblushing French windows and other trifling barbarities of
that description more especially when it is kept in countenance by a
little church of still greater age nestling under its wing in a manner
that recalled the good old days when the lord of the manor was lord of
the souls and bodies of his tenants Even old Mr Lane had been mellowed
by the influence of his new home and before his death had come to play
the part of Squire far more respectably than might be imagined Eugene
sustained the role with the graceful indolence and careless efficiency
that marked most of his doings
He stood one Saturday morning in the latter part of July on the steps
that led from the terrace to the lawn holding a letter in his hand and
softly whistling In appearance he was not it must be admitted an
ideal Squire for he was but a trifle above middle height rather
slight and with the little stoop that tells of the man who is townbred
and by nature more given to indoor than outdoor exercises but he was a
goodlooking fellow for all that with a bright humorous facethough
at this moment rather a bored onelarge eyes set well apart and his
proper allowance of brown hair and white teeth Altogether it may
safely be said that not even Sir Rodericks nose could have sniffed the
workhouse in the young master of Millstead Manor
Still whistling Eugene descended the steps and approached a group of
people sitting under a large copperbeech tree A still hot summer
morning does not incline the mind or the body to activity and all of
them had sunk into attitudes of ease Mrs Lanes work was reposing in
her lap her sister Miss Jane Chambers had ceased the pretense of
reading the Rector was enjoying what he kept assuring himself was only
just five minutes peace before he crossed over to his parsonage and his
sermon Lady Claudia Territon and Miss Katharine Bernard were each in
possession of a wicker lounge while at their feet lay two young men in
flannels with lawntennis racquets lying idle by them A large jug of
beer close to the elbow of one of them completed the luxurious picture
that was framed in a light cloud of tobacco smoke traceable to the
person who also was obviously responsible for the beer
As Eugene approached a sudden thought seemed to strike him He stopped
deliberately and with great care lit a cigar
Why wasnt I smoking I wonder he said The sight of Bob Territon
reminded me Then as he reached them raising his voice he went on
Ladies and gentlemen I am sorry to interrupt you and with bad news
What is the matter dear asked Mrs Lane a gentle old lady who
having once had the courage to leave the calm of her fathers country
vicarage to follow the doubtful fortunes of her husband was now reaping
her reward in a luxury of which she had never dreamed
With the arrival of the 415 this afternoon Eugene continued our
placid life will be interrupted and one of Mr Eugene Lane MPs
celebrated Saturday to Monday parties I quote from The Universe will
begin
Whos coming asked Miss Bernard
Miss Bernard was the acknowledged beauty referred to in the opening
lines of this chapter whose love Eugene had been lucky enough to
secure Had Eugene not been absurdly rich himself he might have been
congratulated further on the prospective enjoyment of a nice little
fortune as well as the ladys favor
Is Rickmansworth coming put in Lady Claudia before Eugene had time
to reply to his fiancee
Be at peace he said addressing Lady Claudia your brother is not
coming I have known Rickmansworth a long while and I never knew him to
be polite He inquired by telegram reply not paid who were to be here
When I wired him telling him whom I had the privilege of entertaining
and requesting an immediate reply not paid he answered that he
thought I must have enough Territons already and he didnt want to make
another
Neither Lady Claudia nor her brother Robert who was the young man with
the beer seemed put out at this message Indeed the latter went so far
as to say
Good Have some beer Eugene
But who is coming repeated Miss Kate Really Eugene you might pay
a little attention to me
Cant my dear Katenot in public Its not good form is it Lady
Claudia
Eugene said Mrs Lane in a tone as nearly severe as she ever arrived
at if you wish your guests to have either dinner or beds you will at
once tell me who and how many they are
My dear mother they are in number five composed as follows First
the Bishop of Bellminster
A most interesting man observed Miss Chambers
I am glad to hear it Aunt Jane responded Eugene The Bishop is
accompanied by his wife That makes two and then old Merton who was at
the Colonial Office you know and Morewood the painter make four
Sir George Merton is a Radical isnt he asked Lady Claudia severely
He tries to be said Eugene Shall I order a carriage to take you to
the station I think you know you can stand it with Haddingtons
help
Mr Spencer Haddington the other young man in flannels was a very
rising member of the Conservative party of which Lady Claudia conceived
herself to be a pillar Identity of political views in Mr Haddingtons
opinion might well pave the way to a closer union and this hope
accounted for his having consented to pair with Eugene who sat on the
other side and spend the last week in idleness at Millstead
Well said Mr Robert Territon it sounds slow old man
Candid family the Territons remarked Eugene to the copperbeech
Whos the fifth youve only told us four said Kate who always
stuck to the point
The fifth is Eugene paused a moment as though preparing a
sensation the fifth isFather Stafford
Now it was a remarkable thing that all the ladies looked up quickly and
reechoed the name of the last guest in accents of awe whereas the men
seemed unaffected
Why where did you pick him up asked Lady Claudia
Pick him up Ive known Charley Stafford since we were both that high
We were at Harrow and at Oxford together Rickmansworth knows him Bob
You didnt come till hed left
Why is the gentleman called Father said Bob
Because he is a priest Miss Chambers answered And really Mr
Territon youre very ignorant Everybody knows Father Stafford You do
Mr Haddington
Yes said Haddington Ive heard of him Hes an Anglican Father
isnt he Had a big parish somewhere down the Mile End Road
Yes said Eugene Hes an old and a great friend of mine Hes quite
knocked up poor old chap and had to get leave of absence and Ive
made him promise to come and stay here for a good part of the time to
rest
Then hes not going off again on Monday asked Mrs Lane
Oh I hope not Hes writing a book or something that will keep him
from being restless
How charming said Lady Claudia Dont you dote on him Kate Please
Mr Lane may I stay too
By the way said Eugene Stafford has taken a vow of celibacy
I knew that said Lady Claudia imperturbably
Eugene looked mournful Bob Territon groaned tragically but Lady
Claudia was quite unmoved and turning to the Rector who sat smiling
benevolently on the young people asked
Do you know Father Stafford Dr Dennis
No I should be much interested in meeting him Ive heard so much of
his work and his preaching
Yes said Lady Claudia and his penances and fasting and so on
Poor old Stafford said Eugene Its quite enough for him that a
things pleasant to make it wrong
Not your philosophy Master Eugene said the Rector
No Doctor
But whats this vow asked Kate
Theres no such thing as a binding vow of celibacy in the Anglican
Church announced Miss Chambers
Is that right Doctor said Lady Claudia
God bless me my dear said the Rector I dont know There wasnt
in my time
But Eugene surely Im right persisted Aunt Jane His Bishop can
dispense him from it cant he
Dont know answered Eugene He says he can
Who says he can
Why the Bishop
Well then of course he can
All right said Eugene only Stafford doesnt think so Not that he
wants to be released He doesnt care a bit about womenvery
ungrateful as theyre all mad about him
Thats very rude Eugene said Kate in reproving tones Admiration
for a saint is not madness Shall we go in Claudia and leave these men
to pipes and beer
One for you Rector chuckled Bob Territon who knew no reverence
The two girls departed somewhat scornfully arm in arm and the Rector
too rose with a sigh and accompanied the elder ladies to the house
whither they were going to meet the pony carriage that stood at the hall
door A daily drive was part of Mrs Lanes ritual
By the way you fellows Eugene resumed throwing himself on the
grass I may as well mention that Stafford doesnt drink or eat meat
or smoke or play cards or anything else
What a peculiar beggar said Bob
Yes and hes peculiar in another way said Eugene a little dryly
he particularly objects to any remark being made on his habitsI mean
on what he eats and drinks and so on
There I agree said Bob I object to any remarks on what I eat and
drink and he look a long pull at the beer
You must treat him with respect young man Haddington I know will
study him as a phenomenon I cant protect him against that
Mr Haddington smiled and remarked that such revivals of medivalism
were interesting if morbid and having so delivered himself he too
went his way
That chaps considered very clever isnt he asked Bob of his host
indicating Haddingtons retreating figure
Very I believe said Eugene Hes a cuckoo you see
Dashed if I do said Bob
He steals other birds nestseggs and all
Your natural history is a trifle mixed old fellow kindly explain
Well hes a thief of ideas Never was the father of one himself and
gets his living by kidnapping
I never knew such a chap ejaculated Bob helplessly Why cant you
say plainly that you think hes an ass
I dont said Eugene Hes by no means an ass Hes a very clever
fellow But he lives on other mens ideas
Oh come and play billiards
I cant said Eugene gravely Im going to read poetry to Kate
By Jove does she make you do that
Eugene nodded sadly and Bob went off into a fit of obtrusive chuckling
Eugene cast a large cushion dexterously at him and caught him just in
the mouth and still sadly rose and went in search of his ladylove
Why the dickens does he marry that girl exclaimed Bob It beats me
Bob Territon was not the only person in whom Eugenes engagement to Kate
Bernard inspired some surprise But neither he nor any one else
succeeded in formulating very definite reasons for the feeling Kate was
a beauty and a beauty of a type undeniably orthodox and almost
aristocratic She was tall and slight her nose was the least trifle
arched her fingers tapered and so it was believed did her feet Her
hair was golden her mouth was small and her accomplishments
considerable From her childhood she had been considered clever and had
vindicated her reputation by gaining more than one certificate from the
various examining bodies which nowadays go up and down seeking whom they
may devour All these varied excellences Eugene had had full
opportunities of appreciating for Kate was a distant cousin of his on
the mothers side and had spent a large part of the last few years at
the Manor It was in fact so obviously the duty of the two young
people to fall in love with one another that the surprise exhibited by
their friends could only have been based on a somewhat cynical view of
humanity The cynics ought to have considered themselves confuted by the
fait accompli but they refused to do so and led by Sir Roderick
Ayre had been known to descend to laying five to four against the
permanency of the engagementan obviously coarse and improper
proceeding
It is possible that the odds might have risen a point or two had these
reprehensible persons been present at the little scene which occurred on
the terrace whither the girls had betaken themselves and Eugene in his
turn repaired when he had armed himself with Tennyson As he approached
Claudia rose to go and leave the lovers to themselves
Dont go Lady Claudia said Eugene Im not going to read anything
you ought not to hear
Of course it was the right thing for Claudia to go and she knew it But
she was a mischievous body and the sight of a cloud on Kates brow had
upon her exactly the opposite effect to what it ought to have had
You dont really want me to stay do you Wouldnt you two rather be
alone she asked
Much rather have you Eugene answered
Kate rose with dignity
We need not discuss that she said I have letters to write and am
going indoors
Oh I say Kate dont do that I came out on purpose to read to you
Lady Claudia is quite ready to make an audience for you was the
chilling reply as Kate vanished through the open door
There youve done it now said Eugene You really ought not to
insist on staying
Im so sorry Mr Lane But its all your fault And Claudia tried to
make her face assume a look of gravity
A pause ensued and then they both smiled
What were you going to read asked Claudia
Oh Tennysonalways read Tennyson Kate likes it because she thinks
its simple
You flatter yourself that you see the deeper meaning
Eugene smiled complacently
And you mean Kate doesnt Im glad Im not engaged to you Mr Lane
if thats the kind of thing you say
Eugene opened his mouth shut it again and then said blandly
So am I
Thank you You need not be afraid
If I were engaged to you I mightnt like you so well
A slight blush became visible on Claudias usually pale cheek
Eugene looked away toward the horizon
I like the way quite pale people blush he said
What do you want Mr Lane
Ah I see you appreciate my character I want many things I cant
havea great many
No doubt said Claudia still blushing under the mournful gaze which
accompanied those words Do you want anything you can have
Yes I want you to stay several more weeks
Im going to stay said Claudia
How kind exclaimed Eugene
Do you know why
My modesty forbids me to think
I want to see a lot of Father Stafford Goodby Mr Lane Ill leave
you to your private and particular understanding of Tennyson
Claudia
Hold your tongue she whispered in tones of exasperation Its very
wicked and very impertinentand the library doors open and Kates in
there
Eugene fell back in his chair with a horrified look and Claudia rushed
into the house
CHAPTER II
New Faces and Old Feuds
There was no doubt some excuse for the interest that the ladies at
Millstead Manor had betrayed on hearing the name of Father Stafford In
these days when the discussion of theological topics has emerged from
the study into the street there to jostle persons engaged in their
lawful business a man who makes for himself a position as a prominent
champion of any view becomes to a considerable extent a public
character and Charles Staffords career had excited much notice
Although still a young man but little past thirty he was adored by a
powerful body of followers and received the even greater compliment of
hearty detestation from all both within and without the Church to whom
his views seemed dangerous and pernicious He had administered a large
parish with distinction he had written a treatise of profound patristic
learning and uncompromising sacerdotal pretensions He had defended the
institution of a celibate priesthood and was known to have treated the
Reformation with even less respect than it has been of late accustomed
to receive He had done more than all this he had impressed all who met
him with a character of absolute devotion and disinterestedness and
there were many who thought that a successor to the saints might be
found in Stafford if anywhere in this degenerate age Yet though he
was or was thought to be all this his friends were yet loud in
declaringand ever foremost among them Eugene Lanethat a better
simpler or more modest man did not exist For the weakness of humanity
it may be added that Staffords appearance gave him fully the external
aspect most suitable to the part his mind urged him to play for he was
tall and spare his finecut face clean shaven displayed the
penetrating eyes prominent nose and large mobile mouth that the memory
associates with pictures of Italian prelates who were also statesmen
These personal characteristics combined with his attitude on Church
matters caused him to be familiarly known among the flippant by the
nickname of the Pope
Eugene Lane stood upon his hearthrug conversing with the Bishop of
Bellminster and covertly regarding his betrothed out of the corner of an
apprehensive eye They had not met alone since the morning and he was
naturally anxious to find out whether that unlucky Claudia had been
overheard Claudia herself was listening to the conversation of Mr
Morewood the wellknown artist and Stafford who had only arrived
just before dinner was still busy in answering Mrs Lanes questions
about his health Sir George Merton had failed at the last moment like
a Radical said Claudia
I am extremely interested in meeting your friend Father Stafford said
the Bishop
Well hes a firstrate fellow replied Eugene Im sure youll like
him
You young fellows call him the Pope dont you asked his lordship
who was a genial man
Yes You dont mind do you Its not as if we called him the
Archbishop of Canterbury you know
I shouldnt consider even that very personal said the Bishop
smiling
Dinner was announced Eugene gave the Bishops wife his arm whispering
to Claudia as he passed Age before impudence and that young lady
found that she had fallen to the lot of Stafford whereat she was well
pleased Kate was paired with Haddington and Mr Morewood with Aunt
Jane The Bishop of course escorted the hostess
And who said he almost as soon as he was comfortably settled to his
soup is the young lady sitting by our friend the Fatherthe one I
mean with dark hair not Miss Bernard I know her
Thats Lady Claudia Territon said Mrs Lane Very pretty isnt she
and really a very good girl
Do you say really because unless you did I shouldnt believe it
he asked with a smile
Mrs Lane had been moved by this idea but not consciously and a little
distressed at suspecting herself of an unkindness entertained the
Bishop with an entirely fanciful catalogue of Claudias virtues which
being overheard by Bob Territon who had no lady and was at liberty to
listen occasioned him immense entertainment
Claudia meanwhile was drifting into a state of some annoyance
Stafford was very courteous and attentive but he drank nothing and
apparently proposed to dine off dry bread When she began to question
him about his former parish instead of showing the gratitude that might
be expected he smiled a smile that she found pleasure in describing as
inscrutable and said
Please dont talk down to me Lady Claudia
I have been taught responded Claudia rather stiffly to talk about
subjects in which my company is presumably interested
Stafford looked at her with some surprise It must be admitted that he
had become used to more submission than Claudia seemed inclined to give
him
I beg your pardon You are quite right Let us talk about it
No I wont We will talk about you Youve been very ill Father
Stafford
A little knocked up
I dont wonder she said with an irritated glance at his plate which
was now furnished with a potato
He saw the glance
It wasnt that he said that suits me very well
Claudia knew that a pretty girl may say most things so she said
I dont believe it Youre killing yourself Why dont you do as the
Bishop does
The Bishop good man was at this moment drinking champagne
Men have different ways of living he answered evasively
I think yours is a very bad way Why do you do it
Im sure you will forgive me if I decline to discuss the question just
now I notice you take a little wine You probably would not care to
explain why
I take it because I like it
And I dont take it because I like it
Claudia had a feeling that she was being snubbed and her impression was
confirmed when Stafford a moment afterward turned to Kate Bernard who
sat on his left hand and was soon deep in reminiscences of old visits
to the Manor with which Kate contrived to intermingle a little flattery
that Stafford recognized only to ignore They had known one another well
in earlier days and Kate was immensely pleased at finding her
playfellow both famous and not forgetful
Eugene looked on from his seat at the foot of the table with silent
wonder Here was a man who might and indeed ought to talk to Claudia
and yet was devoting himself to Kate
I suppose its on the same principle that he takes water instead of
champagne he thought but the situation amused him and he darted at
Claudia a look that conveyed to that young lady the urgent idea that she
was as boys say dared to make Father Stafford talk to her This was
quite enough Helped by the unconscious alliance of Haddington who
thought Miss Bernard had let him alone quite long enough she seized her
opportunity and said in the softest voice
Father Stafford
Stafford turned his head and found fixed upon him a pair of large dark
eyes brimming over with mingled contrition and admiration
I am so sorrybutbut I thought you looked so ill
Stafford was unpleasantly conscious of being human The triumph of
wickedness is a spectacle from which we may well avert our eyes Suffice
it to say that a quarter of an hour later Claudia returned Eugenes
glance with a look of triumph and scorn
Meanwhile trouble had arisen between the Bishop and Mr Morewood
Morewood was an artist of great ability originality and skill and if
he had not attained the honors of the Academy it was perhaps more of
his own fault than that of the exalted body in question as he always
treated it with an ostentatious contumely After all the Academy must
be allowed its feelings Moreover his opinions on many subjects were
known to be extreme and he was not chary of displaying them He was
sitting on Mrs Lanes left opposite the Bishop and the latter had
started with his hostess a discussion of the relation between religion
and art All went harmoniously for a time they agreed that religion had
ceased to inspire art and that it was a very regrettable thing and
there one would have thought the subjectnot being a new onemight
well have been left Suddenly however Mr Morewood broke in
Religion has ceased to inspire art because it has lost its own
inspiration and having so ceased it has lost its only use
The Bishop was annoyed A wellbred man himself he disliked what seemed
to him illbred attacks on opinions which his position proclaimed him to
hold
You cannot expect me to assent to either of your propositions Mr
Morewood he said If I believed them you know I should not be in
the place I am
Theyre true for all that retorted Morewood And what is it to be
traced to
Im sure I dont know said poor Mrs Lane
Why to Established Churches of course As long as fancies and
imaginary beings are left free to each man to construct or destroy as he
willor again I may say as long as they are fluidthey subserve
the pleasurableness of life But when you take in hand and make a Church
out of them and all that what can you expect
I think you must be confusing the Church with the Royal Academy
observed the Bishop with some acidity
There would be plenty of excuse for me if I did replied Morewood
Theres no truth and no zeal in either of them
If you please we will not discuss the truth But as to the zeal what
do you say to the example of it among us now And the Bishop lowering
his voice indicated Stafford
Morewood directed a glance at him
Hes mad he said briefly
I wish there were a few more with the same mania about
You dont believe all he does
Perhaps I cant see all he does said the Bishop with a touch of
sadness
How do you mean
I have been longer in the cave and perhaps I have peered too much
through cavespectacles
Morewood looked at him for a moment
Im sorry if Ive been rude Bishop he said more quietly but a man
must say what he thinks
Not at all times said the Bishop and he turned pointedly to Mrs
Lane and began to discuss indifferent matters
Morewood looked round with a discontented air Miss Chambers was
mortally angry with him and had turned to Bob Territon whom she was
trying to persuade to come to a bazaar at Bellminster on the Monday Bob
was recalcitrant and here too the atmosphere became a little disturbed
The only people apparently content were Kate and Haddington and Lady
Claudia and Stafford To the rest it was a relief when Mrs Lane gave
the signal to rise
Matters improved however in the drawingroom The Bishop and Stafford
were soon deep in conversation and Claudia thus deprived of her former
companion condescended to be very gracious to Mr Morewood in the
secret hope that that eccentric genius would make her the talk of the
studios next summer by painting her portrait Haddington and Bob had
vanished with cigars and Eugene looking round and seeing that all was
peace said to himself in an access of dutifulness Now for it and
crossed over to where Kate sat and invited her to accompany him into
the garden
Kate acquiesced but showed little other sign of relaxing her attitude
of lofty displeasure She left Eugene to begin
Im awfully sorry Kate if you were vexed this morning
Absolute silence
But you see as host here I couldnt very well turn out Lady
Claudia
Why dont you say Claudia asked Kate in sarcastic tones
Eugene felt inclined to fly but he recognized that his only chance lay
in pretending innocence when he had it not
Are we to quarrel about a trifle of that sort he asked a girl Ive
known like a sister for the last ten years
Kate smiled bitterly
Do you really suppose that deceives me Of course I am not afraid of
your falling in love with Claudia but its very bad taste to have
anything at all like flirtation with her
Quite right it is It shall not occur again Isnt that enough
Kate in spite of her confidence was not anxious to drive Eugene with
too tight a rein so with a nearer approach to graciousness she allowed
it to appear that it was enough
Then come along he said passing his arm around her waist and
running her briskly along the terrace to a seat at the end where he
deposited her
Really Eugene one would think you were a schoolboy Suppose any one
had seen us
Some one did said Eugene composedly lighting his cigar
Who
Haddington He was sitting on the step of the sundial smoking
How annoying Whats he doing there
If you ask me I expect hes waiting on the chance of Lady Claudia
coming out
I should think it very unlikely said Kate with an impatient tap of
her foot and I wish you wouldnt do such things
Eugene smiled and having thus as he conceived partly avenged himself
devoted the next ten minutes to orthodox lovemaking with the warmth of
which Kate had no reason to be discontent On the expiration of that
