CHAPTER I
PLANS
Doctor Hugh leaned back in his swivel chair and looked anxiously at his
mother
I dont believe you realize how incessant the noise will be he
urged  Every morning hammering and sawing and the inevitable shouting
and argument that seem to attend all building operations especially
when the job is one of alteration like this
I shall not mind the noise dear said Mrs Willis tranquilly  Let
me see the plans again
She held out her hand for the blue prints and four interested heads
immediately bent above them Rosemary being tall enough to look over
her mothers shoulder and Sarah and Shirley pressing close to her side
I dont see how anyone can tell a thing from that Rosemary
complained  Theres nothing but white lines
The doctor smiled but his glance was on the frail almost transparent
hands which held the roll of paper flat on the desk
I suppose you thought that carpenters worked from photographs of
completed interiors or illustrations in interiordecoration
catalogues he suggested goodnaturedly  You see before you
Rosemary a most practical conception of two offices and a reception
room  Mr Greggs will rip out one side of the house and add them on as
a wing and when the joining is painted over youll think those rooms
were built when the original house was
Wellall right conceded Rosemary I suppose Mr Greggs knows
Anyway it will be fun to have something going on  Vacation certainly
isnt very exciting
I want to see them rip the house announced Sarah with intense
satisfaction
I think I owe it to Mr Greggs almost as much as to Mother to have
you at a safe distance before the ripping begins said Doctor Hugh a
little grimly  Somehow I have the feeling Sarah that the bestlaid
plans of architects may go awry when youre about
Huh retorted Sarah abandoning blue prints for her favorite goatskin
rug on which she flopped in an attitude more comfortable than graceful
Shirley too wearying of the unfamiliar turned to the delights of the
iron wastebasket into which she tried to wedge her plump self with
indifferent success and a great crackling of paper
Doctor Hugh began to sharpen a pencil with meticulous care his dark
eyes behind their glasses apparently intent on the task in hand  But
the more discerning of his patients and every nurse who had served on
his cases could have told you that Doctor Willis always saw most when
he appeared to be quite absorbed
Even an outsider would have been interested in the group gathered in
the young doctors office that summer afternoon  The little mother
she was no taller than her oldest daughter and came only to her tall
sons shoulder sat at one side of the flattopped desk leaning her
head on one hand as she studied the plans for the addition to the
house  She was very lovely and very appealing from her wavy dark hair
faintly streaked with gray to her little buckled slippers and there
was nothing of the invalid about her  It would have been difficult to
say offhand just why she should inspire the conviction immediate
and swift that those who loved her must be constantly on guard to
protect her against physical exhaustion and weakness  Difficult that
is only until one saw her patient shining eyes and then one knew
what had never been hidden from Doctor Hugh that in her body dwelt an
unquenchable spirit that would always outrun her strength
In Rosemary leaning above her mother and studying the blue prints so
intently that a little frown gathered between her arched brows the
spirit and strength were united  The effect of Rosemary on the most
casual beholder was always one of radiance  The mass of her waving
hair was bronze said her friends it was red it was gold it was all
of these  Her eyes were like her mothers a violet blue but dancing
drenched in tears or black with stormseldom patient eyes  She lived
intensely did Rosemary and sometimes she hurt herself and sometimes
she hurt others  She could be obstinatewanting her own way with the
insistence of a driving force that was the Willis will working in her
Winnie said  All the Willis children had that trait Winnie said also
Rosemary could be sorry and make frank confession  That Sarah always
thought was the hardest thing in the world to do
The dark and stolid Sarah lying on her stomach on the white goatskin
rug was the queer one of the family  Sarahs nature was as
uncompromising as her own squaretoed sandals and about as blunt
Demonstrations of affection bored her  She tended strictly to her
interests and felt small concern in the affairs of her sisters  You
could reach Sarahafter you had learned the wayand the depths in her
were worth reaching  But her one passionate devotion was for
animalsshe would do anything for her pets dare anything for them
Sometimes Doctor Hugh wondered if she would not sacrifice anyone to
their needs
If one desired a contrast to Sarah there was Shirley  Shirley who sat
in the wastebasket and beamed upon an approving world  Six year old
Shirley was a born sunbeam and her brief fits of temper only seemed to
intensify the normal sunshine of her disposition  She smiled and she
coaxed answering smiles from the severest mortal she dimpled and
laughter bubbled up to meet her chuckling mirth  It was impossible to
remain cross or illtempered when Shirley danced into a room and it is
to be feared that her gifts of cajolery bought her off from often
needed reproofs  It was never easy to scold Shirley
Doctor Hugh Willis sharpening his pencil so painstakingly knew all
this and more  To his natural endowment of keeneyed penetration had
been recently added the illuminating experience of a year as sole head
of the householda year in which the little mother had been absent in
a sanitarium recovering her shattered health and he had been
responsible for the welfare of his sisters
Not the least interesting figure of that groupDoctor Hugh
Darkhaired darkeyed and tall his keen intelligent face could be as
expressive as Rosemarys  His chin was firm and his mouth could be
grim and smiling by turns  His speaking voice was rather remarkable
in the range of its modulations and his manner was incisive as one used
to commanding obedience  His patients said Doctor had a way with him
Shall I cut the cake or put it on whole inquired someone blandly on
the other side of the closed door
Theres Winnie said Mrs Willis lifting her head and smiling
Open the door Shirley
Five pairs of eyes turned affectionately to the tall thin woman who
stepped into the room as Shirley obeyed  This was Winnie without whom
the Willis household would have been lost indeed since for twentyeight
years she had solved every domestic difficulty for them shrewdly and
capably  Loyalty and service were beautiful concrete things in her
faithful loving eyes  Dear Winnie
About the cake she said now smoothing her immaculate apron and
glancing sharply at the circle of rather serious faces
Bother the cake answered Doctor Hugh secure in the knowledge that
whatever he said would receive Winnies unqualified approval  Have
you seen the plans for the new office Winnie
That I have not she replied eagerly and Rosemary yielded her place
while Winnie stared over Mrs Willis shoulder at the mysterious white
lines and dots
You must be expecting a lot of sick folks Hughie she commented
after a moments study
Ill give up the other office the doctor explained and have all my
office hours here
When can Mr Greggs start work Hugh asked his mother rescuing the
elastic bands from Shirley and moving the ink well back from the small
exploring fingers
Next week he hopes Doctor Hugh answered  There wont be any
digging to be done because we are not going to extend the cellar but
there will be mason work for the foundation and they want to open out
the side of the hall as soon as they start
It will be messy said Winnie with unmistakable disapproval of
anything messy
It will be messy agreed the doctor  Worse than that it will be
noisy  I want Mother and you to take the girls and go away till it is
over  I dont think anyone should be asked to endure the sound of
constant hammering in the hot weather Ill be out of the house so much
that I dont count and of course Ill keep the other office till things
are in shape here
He spoke evenly but his eyes met Winnies across Mrs Willis shapely
drooping head
I think we ought to get out of Mr Greggs way declared Winnie
briskly  Carpenters have small patience with women and their
housekeeping habits  They think were interfering when we only want to
keep em from driving nails in the mahogany tables  And if theyre
going to ruin the hall rug with their bricks and mortar I for one
dont want to be here to see it
Oh Winnie you fraud Mrs Willis spoke merrily  You are not
worrying about the hall rugI know you too well  Youre siding with
Hugh and you are both conspiring to wreck the household budget a second
time  I had all the luxury one woman is entitled to last year in the
sanitariumfrom now on I intend to consider expenses and a summer away
from home isnt to be thought of
Your health is worth more than dollars and cents said Winnie sagely
Im not going to take music lessons this vacation offered Rosemary
That ought to help Mother
If I can arrange it so you can leave the house while the alterations
are being put through and yet keep the living expenses down to your
stipulated levelwill you go Mother said Doctor Hugh artfully
Can you come too countered his mother
Wellpart of the time at least he temporized
A sudden picture of her orderly quiet home in the hands of the
loudtalking aggressively cheerful town carpenter and his helpers the
gash in the hall letting in dirt and flies with the attendant bustle
and confusion that go with artisan work flashed across Mrs Willis
vision  Sarah and Shirley must be constantly admonished to keep out of
mischief and danger Winnie placated when her domain should be
encroached upon  And the noise of hammers and saws and files
I have only two objections to going away Hugh said Mrs Willis
quietly  One is leaving you and the other is the expense
Then it is as good as settled declared Doctor Hugh rolling up the
blue prints and snapping an elastic around them as though he snapped
his ideas into place with the same deft movement
Rosemarys eyes began to shine
Oh Hugh tell us she begged  I know you have some perfectly
lovely plantell us what it is
But the doctors smile was enigmatic and the two words he vouchsafed a
conundrum to them all
Rainbow Hill was the answer he made to every question
Winnie always an ally of the doctors appealed to could give no
help  If you studied geography more and cats less Sarah she
informed that small girl who insisted on repeated questioning you
might be able to tell me  Ive told you before that I know nothing at
all about this Rainbow Hill
And Rosemary waylaying her brother with carefully planned nonchalance
fared no more successfully
You cant wheedle any news out of me my dear announced Doctor Hugh
his eyes twinkling  All in good timeand after Mother youll be the
first to be told  Patience is a virtue Rosemary
And then he ducked to escape the porch cushion she sent whirling toward
him
CHAPTER II
LOOKING FORWARD
I dont believe youve heard a word Ive been saying Jack Welles
The boy on his knees before the tangled fishing tackle spread out on
the lowest porch step looked up alertly
Sure I heard he protested  Something or other is perfectly
adorable
Rosemary laughed  She had been sitting in the porch swing and now she
came and camped on the middle step chin in hand regardless of the hot
sunshine that turned her bronze hair to red gold
I suppose I did say that she admitted  But it really is Jack  I
dont believe Mother would call it an exaggeration
Jack Welles frowned at a tangle of line  I heard you he said again
but I didnt get where this place isI saw you and your mother going
off with Hugh in the car this morning he added
Ill untangle that for you offered Rosemary holding out her hand
for the line  We went to see Rainbow Hill and now Mother is crazy to
go there for the summer  Hugh is as pleased as pleased can be for he
wants her to go somewhere before Mr Greggs starts the work here
Wheres Rainbow Hill asked Jack watching the slim fingers as they
worked at the waxed silk thread so woefully knotted
Thats the best part of the whole plan Rosemary assured him taking
his knowledge of a plan for granted  Its only about eight or nine
miles from here and twelve from Bennington  Hugh can easily come out
in the car  You must have seen the house Jackit is right on the
tiptop of that hill to the right the little white clapboarded house
you see as soon as you pass the crossroads
Ive seen it said Jack
Well you may have seen it but you cant tell how lovely it is until
you go through it declared Rosemary winding a free length of line
about her slender wrist for safekeeping  Theres no front porchyou
step into the livingroom right from the lawn  But there is a side
porch with awnings and screens that Mother will just love
Where are the folks who live there demanded the practical Jack
Theyre going to California to visit their married  daughter
Rosemary explained  Theyre patients of HughsMr and Mrs Hammond
And they wanted to rent the house because they didnt like the idea of
closing it for almost three months with all their nice furniture and a
piano and everything in it  Sowasnt it luckythey happened to ask
Hugh if he knew of anyone who would rent the place furnished and he saw
right away it would be just the thing for us
Whereupon they insisted that he take it as a gift with a maid and two
butlers thrown in recited Jack who knew in what affection Doctor
Hughs patients held him
Not exactly dimpled Rosemary but they did say that if Mother would
live there during the summer they would consider it a favor and
wouldnt dream of charging rent  Mrs Hammond said she knew she
wouldnt have to worry about her things if Doctor Hughs mother would
be there to look after them  But of course Hugh wouldnt listen to
thathe said business was business and as soon as he and Mr Hammond
had the rent fixed Hugh took Mother and me to see Rainbow Hill  And
its too lovely for words
Any butlers suggested Jack
Not a butler answered Rosemary firmly  Winnie beats all the
butlers I ever sawor read about she emended remembering that her
actual experience with butlers was limited
Winnie wont take kindly to pumping water from the well every
morning said Jack sorting fish hooks with a practised hand
Theres no water to pump was the prompt and cheerful response
Its an oldfashioned house but the plumbing is newHugh found that
out before he even mentioned Rainbow Hill to Mother  It will be such
fun to show the place to Sarah and ShirleyI can hardly wait
Jack looked up at the vivid glowing face above him
I can imagine Sarah let loose on a farm he said drily  Theyd
better tie up the pigs and nail down the cowsI wouldnt trust that
girl within ten feet of a live animal
You think youre smart Jack Welles broke in the wrathful voice of
Sarah as that young person hurled herself around the side of the house
and confronted them indignantly  You think youre smart dont you
Scuse me Sarah I didnt know you were within hearing distance
apologized Jack with proper contriteness  Dont be mad at me Sally
for here you are going awaywhen are you going
Monday said Sarah sullenly
Youre going away Monday went on Jack and you may not see me till
September cant we part friends Sarah
Sarah regarded him suspiciously but he surveyed her over his fish
hooks and was apparently quite serious
Ill be glad to leave some people in this neighborhood stated Sarah
with peculiar distinctness  Im going to do just as I please at
Rainbow Hill
Then I take it that Hugh wont be there said Jack but Rosemary
hastened to act as peacemaker
Dont fuss she advised them wisely  Jack I may learn how to fish
this summer myselfMr Hammond told Hugh that Mr Hildreth is a great
fisherman
Jack asked who Mr Hildreth was and Sarah answered that he was the
tenant farmer
And his wife is the tenant farmeress said Sarah importantly  They
live in another house and plant thingsHugh told me
Yesm I dont doubt it agreed Jack when he had assimilated this
remarkable information but how come a farmer and a farmeress have
time to give lessons in fishing
Rosemary began on the last knot in the line  Dont be silly Jack
she begged  Therell be two boys thereMrs Hildreth says her
husband gets two students from the State Agricultural College to help
him every summer  Theyll want to go fishing and Sarah and I can go
along
When you farm you farm said Jack sententiously  You dont hoe the
potatoes one day and then go fishing for a week  But I may be wrong at
that and if you find Mr Hildreth needs an extra hired man Rosemary
one to go fishing I mean ask him to send for me  Ill come right up
and fish and look after the garden in my odd moments
Hughs coming to spend two weeks in August announced Sarah  And
hell come out as many weekends as he can will you really come Jack
I always did yearn to be a hired man Jack answered earnestly and
they tell us there is no time like the present to put ones ambition in
training  Im awfully afraid Ill have to earn my living after I leave
school and a nice trade like that of hired man might be useful in my
later life  Ill think it over and let you know Sarah but dont let
Mr Hildreth build on my comingI cant face his grief and
disappointment in case I fail to turn up
You think youre smart was Sarahs retort and Rosemary said to
herself that it was impossible to tell when Jack was in earnest
Winnie came out and told them that lunch was ready just then and Jack
took his fishing tackle and retreated to his own home which was next
door first thanking Rosemary fervently for the unknotted line she
handed him
There were times during the days of preparation for the eventful Monday
when Mrs Willis wondered whether they were really wise to go to so
much trouble times when she thought wearily that her own home noisy
as it might be would be far preferable to the effort required to adapt
her family to a new environment
Rosemary put the feeling into words one noon when the doctor came home
to lunch and found her sitting on the floor beside a trunk with a
lapful of rusty keys
Nothing fits complained Rosemary  All the keys to everything are
lost  And I dont see what good a restful summer will do Mother if she
has nervous prostration before she gets off
Doctor Hugh settled several difficulties in as many minuteshe had a
gift for thatby dispatching Sarah to the locksmith with softsoap
impressions of the keyless locks and orders to get keys to fit them and
insisting that his mother must stay quietly in her room the remainder
of the day and be served with luncheon and supper there
You girls try to talk all at once he told his three sisters when
they sat down at last to Winnies rice waffles and that is enough to
tire anyone
Cant I take the cat Hugh urged Sarah anxiously  You can take it
in the car for me and I know fresh country air will be good for poor
Esther
Esther wouldnt appreciate Rainbow Hill said Doctor Hugh with
conviction  Cats dont like to change their homes Sarah  Besides
youll have all the animals you want once you are on the farm  And
that reminds me I want to say one thing to you
I suppose remarked Sarah plaintively youre going to scold
Not exactly said her brother smiling in spite of himself  But
while I want you to have a happy summer Sarah and collect snakes
and bugs and insects to your hearts content I want you to understand
clearly that the menagerie is to be kept outside of the house  Mother
and Winnie mustnt be expected to get used to finding snakes in boxes
and spiders in bottles and the place to study a colony of ants is
outside not in the front hall  If I find you cant remember this one
rule youll have to come back to Eastshore and stay with me during the
week
Sarah with an unhappy recollection of the furore she had created the
week before when she had bodily transplanted a thriving colony of ants
to the hall rug promised to remember
Jack Welles said he might come up for a couple of weeks and be a hired
man announced Rosemary smiling
I hope he does approved the doctor promptly  Hell find it an
endurance test and a particularly valuable one  Yes Winnie
I wish youd step out and look at the canna bed said Winnie grimly
Every single plant pulled out and left dying in the sun
Why I did that declared Shirley in her clear little voice that
always reminded Winnie of a robins chirp  I thought Mother would
want to take the cannas to Rainbow Hill with uswe can plant them
around the porch there
Doctor Hugh pushed back his chair his mouth twitching
Whatever happens this summer Winnie he said gravely something
tells me that you wont be bored
CHAPTER III
RAINBOW HILL
A white clapboarded house with mossgreen shutters and a dark oak
Dutch door the upper half of which swung hospitably openthis was
Rainbow Hill in the light of the late June afternoon sun  A little
jewel of a house set in the center of a closecropped emeraldgreen
lawn and circled by sturdy old trees elms and maples that had marked
the site of the old homestead and now guarded the new house as it had
been called ever since it had been built six years before to replace
the farmhouse destroyed by fire
Welcome to Rainbow Hill said Mrs Joseph Hildreth coming out on the
red tiled walk as a car swept up to the door and stopped
Mrs Hildreth the wife of the tenant farmer was a young woman with
wideawake blue eyes and an air of capability that struck terror to the
souls of the lazy  She was known far and wide as a hustler and she
had been known to do a large washing and baking in the morning and
drive the hay rake in the field in the afternoon on occasions when her
husband was short of help  It was a pity her voice was so loud and
rasping but then not everyone is sensitive to voices
I guess youll find everything about ready for your supper said Mrs
Hildreth when Doctor Hugh had introduced Sarah and Shirley and Winnie
the three members of the party she had not met previously  I brought
up a pail of strawberriestheyll be better next week  Mrs Hammond
said you were to have half the garden same as they did  The butter
may be a little soft but Joe will get you a piece of ice in the
morning at the creamery  We werent sure youd get here today so I
didnt order it
With a few more confidences directed mainly to Winnie she went back
to her own housean attractive story and a half bungalow just visible
from the side porch and the Willis family were free to take possession
of Rainbow Hill
Isnt it darling Rosemary kept exclaiming  Arent the rugs
prettyand the white curtains  Wait till you see the rooms upstairs
In spite of Winnies warning that supper would be ready in fifteen
minutes and Doctor Hughs declaration that he must go back to Eastshore
as soon as the meal was over it was impossible to refrain from running
upstairs for a peep at the second story  There was a large and airy
bedroom for the mother a connecting room which was allotted to
Rosemary and across the hall a smaller room with twin beds which would
it was instantly decided fit Sarah and Shirley  Next to this was
the guest room which Doctor Hugh would occupy during his visits and at
the other end of the hall next to the shining blue and white tiled
bathroom a square room with two windows and a narrow balcony that
delighted Winnie
Theres no nicer place to dry your hair she explained seriously to
Mrs Willis  I can sit out there and darn stockings while my hair is
drying
The trunks and one or two boxes packed with necessary possessions
mostly of a personal nature had been sent on ahead in the morning and
were already in the halls  The house was tastefully furnished
throughout and Mrs Willis assured her son that as soon as she had
rearranged a few trifles and had unpacked her treasures she was sure
she would feel contented and at home
I want to go everywhere declared Sarah subsiding into a chair at
the diningroom table with visible reluctance  I want to see the
horses and the cows and the pigs  Say Hugh do you think we could
keep pigs when we go home  Theres room in the yard
You want to go to bed early and save your exploring until tomorrow
advised the doctor  I have to be back at the house by eight and
thats bedtime for one little girl I know  Shirley looks sleepy now
Im not said Shirley automatically her invariable remark whenever
the subject was mentioned
Although the doctor had an appointment waiting him he seemed to find
it hard to tear himself away from the pleasant picture the mother and
her three daughters made on the spacious side porch after supper that
night  Winnie had insisted on displaying her convenient kitchen and
though there was no gas range she declared that the oil stove would
fulfill all her requirements except for her weekly baking when she
would build a fire in the range  There Were electric lights throughout
the house and the outbuildings as they learned later as well as the
tenant house were also wired
Here comes somebody said Sarah in a loud whisper  Its the
farmeress
No it isnt its two of them asserted Shirley pressing her small
nose against the wire screen and acquiring a plaid pattern on the tip
Hushtheyll hear you said Mrs Willis rising and opening the
screen door as two young men came across the lawn
Mrs Willis said the taller  Mr Hildreth sent us up to see if you
wanted any help unpacking  This is Richard Gilbert he introduced
his companion and I am Warren Baker  Were working for Mr Hildreth
this summer
Doctor Hugh came forward at once and while they were being introduced
the three girls studied the newcomers with interest  They were both
apparently about eighteen years old both deeply tanned both slim and
muscular and wholesomelooking  Richard  Gilbert was slightly shorter
and heavier than Warren who was really thin  The latter had dark hair
and gray eyes while Richards hair and eyes were brown  Both boys
were neatly if not smartly dressed and gave a pleasant impression of
cleanliness coolness and comfort though they had done a heavy days
work and their day had started at five that morning  Rosemary
instantly decided that she liked them both
So did the rest of the Willis family and Doctor Hugh delayed his
departure till he declared that one more moment would mean he must
break the speed laws to get back to town  It had been arranged that he
was to take his breakfast and dinner with the hospitable Welles a most
convenient plan since their house was the nearest  He was seldom home
for lunch and his telephone calls would be taken care of at the Jordan
office as Eastshore still called the rooms which had been occupied by
the old and popular physician whose practise had been taken over by
Doctor Hugh
Mrs Willis watched him drive away satisfied that his comfort was
provided for and then as she had decreed that no unpacking was to be
done that night Richard and Warren took their leave after promising
to show the girls the whole farm the next morning
If they know what theyre about theyll tie a rope to Sarah said
Winnie going about locking doors and windows as though she expected a
siege
She had managed to get a good look as she said at the visitors and
had approved of them wholeheartedly
Nice ordinary boys she said to Mrs Willis at the first
opportunity  Not a bit stiff or shy  did you notice and yet not any
of these smart Alecs that cant stop talking long enough to listen to
what a body has to say
What are you locking up all the windows for Winnie Sarah questioned
her sitting down on the rug to take off her sandals as a preparation
for the trip upstairs  Youll have to open them all in the morning
again
Well maybe I will admitted Winnie turning the key in the front
door and sliding both bolts with emphasis but I wont come downstairs
