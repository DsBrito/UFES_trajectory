performance Vi you know I dont want to go on here  if radical
surgery is necessary I want you to remember me as a whole man not
a  dummy
Bart oh Bart There was a frown of apprehension on her forehead She
sighed heavily and whispered Can it make so much difference when I
love you Bart
But dont you see Vi It may not be Bart Neely they wheel back here
after the operation He motioned for her to bend closer for the sound
of his voice was becoming weaker In my field Ive seen a lot of crazy
reactions to loss of basic ability Personality reversals brought about
by loss of hearing impotency or even the inability to bear a child
He stroked the back of her hand with his finger Bart Neely without a
voicebox might be a stranger Im not sure youd like him I dont
think Id even like him
An intern backed into the room followed by a gurney Bart shot a look at
Vi This is plan A
Vis eyebrows arched in a question
Exploration and  he paused the nurse tucked a dark gray blanket
all around him He raised his thin white hand and crossed two fingers
and we hope a negative biopsy
There was no pain Whatever the anesthetist had worked out was doing
nicely The overhead light however was giving him a headache and the
operating room was damned cold Jonas and Holsclaw werent talking
much and what they did say wasnt loud enough for Bart to get He
studied their faces Ill know by their faces he assured himself
and if its widespread malignancy Ill proceed with plan B
The sweat was heavy on Jonas forehead The sterile mask hid his nose
and mouth but his eyes behind the lenses of his glasses looked moist
and tired The surgeons gloved fingers manipulated probed cut
Finally he turned to a waiting nurse
Get this analyzed right away That was it the tissue  was it
cancerous or not The atmosphere grew heavy Bart watched the second
hand on the large wallclock swing slowly around its perimeter and then
around again and again The nurse reentered and spoke softly to the
doctor The two doctors whispered explaining to each other with hand
motions what they were going to do
This is it Bart was certain Well hed fool the hell out of the
knowitall doctors He closed his eyes and thought The years he had
spent sharpening his perception his ability to transfer his thoughts
were just the groundwork for this greatest experiment of all He had
transferred thought waves in all forms to all corners of this world with
the highest percentage of accuracy Now Plan B the alternate plan was
to transfer himself He was willing himself out of his own body He
could feel the perspiration trickle down his arms with the effort It
had to work He had to cheat them out of their mutilation No he
couldnt fail He strained against the confines of his body burdening
his brain with thought and suddenly he was free Bart wanted to shriek
with laughter Hed outwitted them There stood grayfaced Jonas working
over that shell not even realizing that it was an empty body It was
like a television play or something everyone clustered around a poor
stiff on the operating table repeating the litany of the sawbones
Scalpel  sponge  clamps
Bart mentally chuckled and fluttered himself upwards above the
squareshaped hospital with its rows of tiny windows Beyond the
polluted air of the city Up and up until there was nothing to look
back on Nothing
Now Bart perceived something ahead It appeared to be a body of land It
looked marvelously appealing dark greens bright yellows and all the
shades in between He hurried forward eager to explore what lay ahead
But as he drew closer becoming more excited over its possibilities he
struck a cold hard surface which repelled him It was like glass and
through it Bart could see a poorly defined figure some distance away
Bart was intrigued This was a mental barrier thrown up by the fellow on
the other side Well hed give the guy some competition Bart
concentrated on cracking the wall building a visual picture of the
breakthrough in his mind
Its useless You cant enter here
Why do you oppose me Bart tested the unseen wall but found no
weakness in its structure
We dont care for your sort
Is that so And how have you classified me
As a coward A suicide A man of meager resources
Im nothing of the kind In the first place I did not commit suicide
Bart wished he could kick at the invisible wall I willed myself away
from an imperfect shell I severed the mind from the body
Why
Because I had cancer of the larynx and Id never have been able to
talk again Id be less than a man
You are less than a man now There was a long period of no exchange
Bart decided he had not made himself clear I didnt want to live
without being able to communicate with other men and women
Communicate Communicate There are a million ways to communicate
Michelangelo communicated Bach Beethoven yes Elvis Presley
communicates Hemingway Martha Graham actors dancers even a baby
communicates
But speech
Speech is the least dependable method of all Few people can explain
their love their pain their innermost feelings in words And often a
man speaks his thoughts and having spoken them finds he really thinks
the opposite No this is secondrate expression and my opinion of you
has not been altered by your feeble argument
The other fellows thoughts came over the wall pounding against Barts
subconscious You consider yourself a man of great intelligence it
went on but your lack of imagination makes you less than mediocre And
as for your mindpower well you see you cannot cross my mental
barrier
Thats not entirely conclusive There may be a catalyst here in this
area which works in conjunction with your thoughtprocesses and not
mine Youre familiar with conditions here while I only know the
earth
You are hardly a challenge to me However to satisfy you that you have
practically no control let us make a test on your home ground
All right You propose the test
Let us see  if you can reenter your former body while I am willing
you to stay here on the other side of that wall
Ahah Youre trying to trick me
I knew before I proposed my plan you would make exactly that excuse in
order to escape my challenge Even in excuses you lacked imagination
Okay its a deal Bart was mad Start concentrating Ill show you
the power of my mind both now and after I resume that shell Bart was
furious He tried to leave the place by the wall He seemed stuck There
were waves like laughter vibrating against the glass Bart strained and
saw that he had come away a little He tried again and again There was
a little more distance gained He tried to build the picture of the
operatingroom in his mind and while he was doing this a flash of Vivian
exploded his mind With that quick image he felt himself free to drift
downward
There indeed was the hospital Bart hurried to the operatingroom
hovering near the ceiling light watching the operating team below
Hes gone doctor The anesthetist looked at Jonas Respirations
stopped altogether
No thought Bart Dont close me out now
Lets open the chest and massage the heart
Yes Yes
I think its futile doctor
We can try
Good old Jonas Bart floated to the table and forced himself into the
shell which lay white and unmoving under the penetrating light from
above It wasnt easy Bart tried to move the heavy hand but it was
quite numb
Not a thing Might as well quit
Holsclaws in a hurry Damn him
Ill massage a little longer
Bart pushed at the leaden eyelid No go Come on come on He felt a
convulsive chill a throbbing in his head
Im getting a pulse Jonas voice was excited
Bart knew there was a searing pain in his throat but shutting it out of
his consciousness was the steady thumping beat of his own heart

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
