THE LOVE AFFAIRS OF GREAT MUSICIANS
VOLUME I
CHAPTER I
THE OVERTURE
Musicians as lovers The very phrase evokes and parades a pageant of
amours The thousand heartaches the fingers clutching hungrily at keys
that might be other fingers the fiddler with his eyelids clenched while
he dreams that the violin against his cheek is the satin cheek of the
inexpressive She the singer with a cry in every note the moonlit
youth with the mandolin tinkling his serenade to an ivied window the
deadmarches the nocturnes the amorous waltzes the duets the trills
and trinkets of flirtatious scherzi the laughing roulades the discords
melted into concord as solitude into the arms of reunionthese are
musics very own
So capable of love and its expression is music indeed that you almost
wonder if any but musicians have ever truly loved or loving have
expressed And yet Round every corner there lurks an and yet And
if you only continue your march or your reading you always reach that
corner
Your first thought would be that a good musician must be a good lover
that a broken heart alone can add the Masters degree to the usual
conservatory diploma of Bachelor of Music that all musicians must be
sentimental if musicians at all and finally that only musicians can
know how to announce and embellish that primeval theme to which all
existence is but variations more or less brilliant more or less in
tune
But go a little further and closer study will prove that some of the
worlds greatest virtuosos in love could neither make nor carry a tune
and that by corollary some of the greatest tunesters in the world were
tyros ignoramuses or heretics in that old lovers arithmetic which
begins 1 plus 1 equals 1
If you care to watch the cohort of musicians good bad and worse that
I shall have to deploy before you you shall see almost every sort and
condition of love and lover that humanity can include And
incidentallyto tuck in here a preface that would otherwise be
skippedlet me explain that in the following affairs I have preferred
to give you the people as accurately as I can make them out
In place of the easy trick of stringing together a number of gorgeous
fairy stories founded on fact I have preferred the long labour of
hunting down the truth and telling only what I have found and believe to
be true Fact and not fancy presentation and not fiction have been the
aim throughout Where the facts are sparse I have not hesitated to say
so have not stooped to pad out gaps with graceful and romantic
imaginings and have indeed never hazarded a guess or an inference
without frankly branding it as such
Furthermore as far as space permits and documents exist the musicians
tell their own stories in their own words
For the making of this little book I have not been able to include all
the men who ever wrote one note after or above another nor to read all
the books ever published in all the worlds languages and yet that I
have been decently thorough will appear I think in the list of books
at the back This does not claim to be a complete bibliography of the
subject but omitting hundreds of books I have ransacked in vain it
catalogues only such works as I have consulted with profit and the
reader could consult with pleasure
It may be well to say that with the exception of the occasional
necessity or seemingnecessity for taking one side or the other in a
matter of dispute I have avoided the facility of bandying highly moral
verdicts and labelling these victors or victims of life with tags
marking their destinations in the next world He who gets into anothers
heart with understanding will find it impossible to indulge in
wholesale blametout comprendre cest tout pardonner So without
pretending to have comprehended any of these human hearts altogether I
have learned enough to lean almost always a little toward the defence
and still more nearly always toward the praise of the woman in the case
And yet the whole effort and viewpoint of the work will be found I
think to be based upon a deep belief that one love is better than two
and that earnestness and honesty and altruism are more blessed and
blissful even with poverty and suffering than any wealth of money or
of fame or of amorous experience
As a last chapter to this series of true stories I have ventured to
sum up the conclusions to which the study of all these affairs has
compelled me and to state a general opinion as to the effect of music
on character It might have been more exciting to some readers if I
had started out with a hard and fast theory and then discarded or
warped everything contradictory to it but it would have been a
dishonest procedure for one who believes that musicians are neither
saints of exaltation nor fiends of lawless ecstasy but only ordinary
clay ovens of fire and ashes like the rest of us He who generalises is
lost and yet I make bold to believe that the conclusion of this book is
true and reasonable and in accordance with such evidence as could be
collected
And now after this beforethecurtain lecture it is high time as
Artemus would say to rise the curting
CHAPTER II
THE ANCIENTS
The very origins and traditions of the trade of music seem to enforce a
certain versatility of emotion and experience Apollo the particular
god of music was not much of a lover and what few affairs he had were
hardly happy his suit was either declined with thanks or if accepted
ended in the death of the lady as for himselfbeing a god he was
denied the comfortable convenience of suicide Daphne as every one
knows took to a tree to escape his attentions and Coronis as so many
another woman was soon blase of divine courtship and for variety
turned her eyes elsewhere She was punished with death indeed but her
son was Aesculapius Which explains the medicinal value music has always
claimed
Old Boetiuswho had affection enough for both a first and a second
wifetells in his treatise on music many anecdotes of the arts
influence not only upon sickness but upon wrathful mobs bent on
mischief He quotes Platos statement that the greatest caution is to
be taken not to suffer any change in wellmoraled music there being no
corruption of manners in a republic so great as that which follows a
gradual declination from a prudent and modest music for whatever
corruptions are made in music the minds of the hearers will immediately
suffer the same it being certain that there is no way to the affections
more open than that of hearing
The musician proverbially both plays upon and is a lyre This
instrument as is well known was first made out of a vacant
turtleshell by Mercury the god of gymnastic exercises and of theft
that is to say of technic and of plagiarism Mercury was nimble with
his affections also among his progeny was the great god Pan who is
frequently reported and commonly believed to be dead Pan was so far
from beautiful that even his nurse could not find a compliment for him
and in fact dropped him and ran Considering what one usually expects of
a newborn infant Pan must have been really unattractive His lack of
personal charm was the origin of the invention of Pans pipes or syrinx
Miss Syrinx of the Naiad familyone of the first families of
Arcadiawas so horrified when Pan proposed to her that she fled He
pursued and she begged aid of certain nymphs who lived in a houseboat
on the river Ladon When Pan thought to seize her he found his arms
filled with reeds How many a lover has pursued thus ardently some
charmer only to find that when he has her he has but a broken reed
But Pan noting that the wind was sighing musically about the reeds cut
seven of them with a knife and bound them together as a pastoral pipe A
wise fellow he and could profit even from a jilt
The eminent musician Arion the inventor of glee clubsa fact which
should not be cherished against himseems to have loved no one except
himself and therein to have had no rivals The famous fish story to the
effect that when he was compelled to leap into the sea by certain
mariners he was carried to shore on the back of a dolphin is only
Jonahs adventure turned inside out
Another early soloist was Orpheus the beautiful love story of whose
life is common property He was torn to pieces by frantic women a fate
that seems always to threaten some of our prominent pianists and
violinists at the hands of the matinee Bacchantes
The patron saint of Christian music Saint Cecilia had a remarkable
married life including a platonic affair with an angel which caused
her pagan husband a certain amount of natural anxiety Geoffrey Chaucer
can tell you the legend of her martyrdom with the crystal charm of all
his poesy
The early Christian Church with its elaborate vocal worship accomplished
much for the cause of music but also with its vast encouragement to
the monastic life and to celibacy coerced a great number of musicians
to be monks This banishes them from a place herenot by any means
because their being monks prevented their having love affairs but
because it greatly prevented a record of most of themthough happily
not all Abelard for instance was a monk and his Heloise became a
nun and their love letters are among the most precious possessions in
literature Liszt that Hungarian rhapsodist in amours was he not also
an abbe There was a priestmusician George de la Hele who about 1585
gave up a lucrative benefice to marry a woman dowered with the name
Madalena Guabaelaraoen But most of them kept their benefices and their
sweethearts both though we find it noted as worthy of mention in the
epitaph of the composer and canon Pierre de la Rue in the 16th
century that as an adorateur diligent du TresHaut ministre du
Christ il sut garder la chastete et se preserver du contact de lamour
sensuel But because you see it in an epitaph it is not always
necessarily so
Sir John Hawkins in his delightsome though ponderous history of music
tells of the disastrous infatuation of Angelus Politianus who
flourished in 1460 as a canon of the Church and the teacher of the
children of Lorenzo dei Medici
Ange Politien he says a native of Florence who passed for the
finest wit of his time in Italy met with a fate which punished his
criminal love Being professor of eloquence at Florence he unhappily
became enamoured of one of his young scholars who was of an illustrious
family but whom he could neither corrupt by his great presents nor by
the force of his eloquence The vexation he conceived at this
disappointment was so great as to throw him into a burning fever and in
the violence of the fit he made two couplets of a song upon the object
with which he was transported He had no sooner done this than he raised
himself from his bed took his lute and accompanied it with his voice
in an air so tender and affecting that he expired in singing the second
couplet
Which reminds one of the actor Artemus Ward describes as having played
Hamlet in a Western theatre where there being no orchestra he was
compelled to furnish his own slow music and to play on a flute as he
died
CHAPTER III
THE MEN OF FLANDERS
The Belgian historian Van der Straeten has illuminated the crowded
shelves of his big work La Musique aux PaysBas avant Le XIXe Siecle
with various little instances of romance that occurred to the numberless
minstrels and weavers of tangled counterpoint in the Netherlands of the
old time Some of these instances are simply hints upon which the
fervid imagination will spin imaginary love yarns in endless gossamer
Thus of Marc Houtermann 15371577 Prince of musicians at Brussels
All we know of his wife is from her epitaph She died the same year he
diedso we fancy it was of a broken heart she died and she was only
twentysix at the timeso we can imagine how young and lithely
beautiful she must have been Her name too was Joanna Gavadiaa sweet
name surely never wasted on an ungraceful woman and on her tombstone
she is called pudicissima et musicis scientissima So she was good
and she was skilful in music like Bachs second wife and doubtless
like her of infinite help and delight to her husband
Van der Straetens book is cluttered up with documents of musty
interest Among them are a number that gain a pathetic interest by the
frequence of the appeals of musicians or their widows for a pittance of
charity from the hand of some royal or ducal patron If there be in
these democratic days any musician who feels humiliated by the struggle
for existence with its necessities for wirepulling and logrolling and
sly advertisement and by the difficulty of stemming the tide of public
ignorance and indifference let him remember that at least he is a free
man and need lick nobodys boots and let him cast an eye upon the
chronicles of shameful humiliation childish deference grovelling
servility and whimsical reward or punishment favour or neglect that
marked the golden age when musicians found patrons from whose conceit
or ennui they might wheedle a most uncertain living
Among the most pathetic of such instances is that of Josse Boutmy
16801779 court organist at Brussels and famous in his daywhich
was a long day When he was at the age of eighty and the father of
twelve children he had to stoop to appeals for charity again at
ninetyseven he appeals At ninetyeight he pleads to be retired with a
pension at ninetynine he dies Three days after his death his son is
asking a pension for the mother of that dozen children She also writes
a pitiful letter still preserved
My husband Judocus Boutmy had the happiness of serving for
thirtyfive years as first organist of the chapel of Your Highness
Infirmities the result of old age and twelve children raised at great
cost to enable them to earn their bread have left me at his death in
indigence the greater since my son Laurent Boutmy who for many years
gave with approbation assistance to his father in the hope of
succeeding to his post has been deprived of this boon by others
The hope of finding subsistence in the heritage of my ancestors made me
go back to Germany where unhappily the death of my brothers my
absence the disorder of war of law and a faithless administration
have prevented at least during my lifetime all that I could hope Save
for the tenderness of a daughter who is herself hardly in easy
circumstances having a family I should lack the necessaries of life
The infirmities resulting on an age of seventy passed in adversity and
work prevent me from gaining my own living
Van der Straeten says that her name was Katrina that she came from
Westphalia Save a few titles of his works and a few accounts of this
pathetic struggle this is all we know of poor Josse Boutmy and his old
wife Then there is Jacques Buus who makes various appeals for aid for
his increasing family A refreshing novelty in these annals of sordid
poverty is given us of HJ De Croes courtorganist at Brussels in the
eighteenth century who was forced to make an appeal for charity
because the son whom he had sent abroad to study did not return to
support his father but decided to marry a woman he met at Ratisbon it
is pleasant to add that the appeal was granted
Adrian Couwenhoven who died in Spain in 1592 left there a widow Ana
Wickerslot who implored the king to grant her money to go back home to
Flanders with her children
The Brebos family were famous organbuilders in the fifteenth century
they were famous marriers toobut one of them met his match Jean
called to Spain married there a widow Marianna Hita with one son The
widow outlived the husband and her son succeeded him in business Gilles
Brebos the best organbuilder in Europe according to his son who
ought to have known married in Spain a woman who was also Flemish When
he died she was a widow raised to the third degree and she was
compelled to appeal to the king for charity In her quaint appeal she
naively points with pride to the fact that in thirty years she had
married with three of his Majestys servants Casada con tres criados
de VM These three were a royal mathematician a captain in the royal
navy killed in the Flanders rebellions and finally a royal
organbuilder We are not told what further royal alliances she
achieved
Among the most famous of early Flemish musicians is Adrian Willaert
14801562 who was born in Bruges and was counted the founder of the
Venetian school He was a pupil of that Prince of Music Josquin
Despres of whom too little is known save that the Church got him
Willaert was the teacher of Zarlino and of Ciprien de Rore who from
his epitaph seems to have left a son though nothing is known of his
marriage
We know nothing of Willaerts liferomance but he must have been
happily married for he made six wills before he died and they are all
preserved In every one of them he mentions his wife Susana though he
never gives her family name In each of his wills he leaves her the bulk
of his fortune in the fourth will he says the last word in devotion by
bequeathing his widow his fortune to enjoy whether she remarries or not
As Van der Straeten says it appears that the affection the old man
vows for his wife grows greater and greater the nearer the fatal day
approaches The most minute dispositions are made in her regard
Strangely enough Willaert never mentions either his compositions or his
daughter Catharine who was a composer too Perhaps this gifted
daughter had a little romance of her own and found herself
disinherited
One of the darkest of the royal English tragedies concerns a musician
one David Ricci or Rizzio who was born at Turin the son of a poor
musicteacher and who when grown managed to join the train of the
Count de Moretto then going as ambassador to Scotland There thrown
upon his own resources in a far cold country this forlorn Italian
managed to ingratiate himself among the musicians of Mary the unhappy
Queen of Scots She eventually noticed him and engaged him as a singer
He gradually rose higher in her political and personal favour till he
became secretary for French affairs and conducted himself with such
odious pride and grew so rich and so powerful that at last he was
dragged from the very presence of the queen and slain And this was in
the year 1566
CHAPTER IV
ORLAND DI LASSUS AND HIS REGINA
A contemporary of the Rizzio so humble as a musician and so soaring in
his intrigues was the great Roland de Lattre better known as Orland di
Lassus or Orlandus Lassus the Belgian Orpheus le Prince des
Musiciens There is as much dispute over the date of his birth as over
the early conditions of his life But he was born in either 1520 or 1530
at Mons in Hainault and according to the old Annales du Hainault he
changed his name from Roland de Lattre to Orland di Lassus because his
father had been convicted of making spurious coin and as a false
moneyer had to wear a string of his evil utterances round his neck
Rarely in history has a composer held a more lofty position than that of
this son of a criminal and even today he rivals Palestrina in the
esteem of historians as one of the pillars of his art
He was in the service of the Duke of Bavaria who gave him as much
honour as the later King of Bavaria gave Wagner he stood so high at
court that a year later he won the hand of a maid of honour Regina
Weckinger She bore him two daughters and four sons One of the
daughters was named after her Regina and when she grew up married a
court painter Two of the sons became prominent composers The mother
was probably beautiful since an old biographer Van Ouickelberg
described her children as elegantissimi
There is every reason to believe that the wedded life of these two was
thoroughly happy save that Lassus was an indefatigable fiend of work
As his biographer Delmotte says His life indeed had been the most
toilsome that one could think of and his fecund imagination always
alert had enfante a multitude of compositions so great that their
very number astounds us they exceeded two thousand and forbids us
almost to believe them the work of one man This incessant tension of
soul made imperious demands for the distraction of repose far from
this he redoubled his work till nature worn out refused to Lassus the
aid she had lavished His mental powers abandoned him abruptly
Regina one day when she returned found him in a very precarious
state he had lost his mind and knew her no more In her terror she
sent word at once to the Princess Maximilienne sister of the Duke
William who sent at once to the invalid her own physician the doctor
Mermann Thanks to his care the health of Orland improved but his
reason did not return From that moment he became sad dreamy absorbed
in melancholy He is no longer said Regina what he was before gay
and content but is become sombre and speaks always of death
While Lassus was in this sad condition he grew petulant over his
imagined illtreatment at the hands of the new duke and wrote a letter
bitterly complaining that he had not carried out his fathers promises
In fact Orland in his condition of semiinsanity threatened to resign
and when the insulted Duke Maximilian showed signs of accepting the
resignation it was the wife that saved the family from disgrace and
poverty Regina made a fervent appeal quoted in Mathieus poem on
Lassus that his Altesse Serenissime be pleased not to heap on the
poor family of Orland the wrongs that the unhappy father may have
deserved through his fantaisies bizarres the result of too much
thought for his art and too incessant zeal but that the duke deign to
continue his former treatment for to put him out of the service of the
court chapel would be to kill him
He was left undisturbed in his post but before long death forced the
acceptance of his resignation Over his grave was placed a tomb on which
besides the effigy of himself are shown also his devoted wife and some
of their children
Regina two years later founded a perpetual annual funeral service for
him By a later intercession she secured for her son Ferdinand the
succession to his fathers dignities at the court of Bavaria She died
June 5 1600 and on her tomb she is named la noble et vertueuse dame
Regina de Lassin veuve de feu Orland de Lassus She had been a good
wife to a good husband The sadness of her latter years with her beloved
and demented husband reminds one of the pathetic fate of Robert Schumann
and his wife
CHAPTER V
HENRY AND FRANCES PURCELL
If Lassus deserved the name of the Netherlandish Orpheus Henry Purcell
deserved the name his loveing wife Frances Purcell gave him when she
published after his death a collection of his songs under the name of
Orpheus Britannicus The analogy holds good also in the devotion of
these married couples for Henry willed to Frances the whole of his
property absolutely
Yet the legend of the cause of his death would verify the old theory
about the joltiness of the course of true love For Sir John Hawkins
passes along the gossip that Purcell met his death by a cold which he
caught in the night waiting for admittance into his own house It is
said that he used to keep late hours and that his wife had given orders
to his servants not to let him in after midnight unfortunately he came
home heated with wine from the tavern at an hour later than that
prescribed him and through the inclemency of the weather contracted
a disorder of which he died If this be true it reflects but little
honour on Madam Purcell for so she is styled in the advertisements of
his works and but ill agrees with those expressions of grief for her
dear lamented husband which she makes use of to Lady Elizabeth Howard in
the dedication of the Orpheus Britannicus It seems probable that the
disease of which he died was rather a lingering than an acute one
perhaps a consumption and that for some time at least it had no way
affected the powers of his mind since one of the most celebrated of his
compositions the song From Rosy Bowers is in the printed book said
to have been the last of his works and to have been set during that
sickness which put a period to his days
Hawkins guesses that Purcell was married young because at the age of
twentyfive he was advertising the sale of his first sonatas at his own
house also that musicianlike he left his family dependent upon the
favour of his benefactors particularly upon the graciousness of his
pupil and patroness Lady Elizabeth Howard who placed on his tomb in
Westminster Abbey the famous inscription often credited to Dryden Here
lyes Henry Purcell Esq who left this life and is gone to that
blessed place where only his harmony can be exceeded
We now know that Purcells marriage was either in 1680 or 1681 when he
was twentytwo or twentythree years old August 2d 1682 Purcells
father a venerable and distinguished musician and a friend of Pepys
the diarist was buried in Westminster Abbey where later his more
distinguished son was laid A few days after the elder Purcells burial
Henry and his wife came to Westminster Abbey again for the baptism of a
son newborn He died in a few months and a third time they came to the
sad old abbey to lay their child in the cloisters there
The next year 1683 a second son died and in 1687 a third boy two
months old was buried in the cloisters of the abbey This monotonous
return of the hand of death must have embittered the life of these two
who seem to have remained lovers always But in May 1688 a daughter
was born named Frances after her mother and she outlived both parents
She married a poet when she and her lover were each nineteen and named
a child Frances after the grandmother On Sept 6th 1689 Henry
Purcells son Edward was baptised and he also lived to attain some
distinction as an organist In 1693 a daughter Mary Peters was born
Two years later on May 21st 1695 the young father diedon the eve of
St Cecilias Day At his bedside were his old mother his young wife
and the two little children Purcell was buried under the organ of
Westminster Abbey and the anthems he had composed for the funeral of
Queen Mary were sung at his own And there he rests near his fellow
musician Pelham Humphries who lies as Runciman says by the side of
his younger wife in the Thamessodden vaults of Westminster Abbey
Purcells will made the very day of his death was as follows
In the name of God Amen I Henry Purcell of the Citty of Manchester
gent being dangerously ill as to the constitution of my body but in
good and perfect mind and memory thanks be to God doe by these
presents publish and declare this to be my last Will and Testament
And I do hereby give and bequeath unto my loving Wife Frances Purcell
all my Estate both reall and personall of what nature and kind soever
to her and to her assigns for ever And I doe hereby constitute and
appoint my said loveing Wife my sole Executrix of this my last Will and
Testament revokeing all my former Will or Wills Witnesse my hand and
scale this twentieth first day of November Annoq Dni One thousand six
hundred ninetyfive and in the seventh yeare of the Raigne of King
William the Third c
H PURCELL
As to Hawkinss theory that Purcell left his wife in needy
circumstances Cummings his biographer believes the thought refuted by
the will left by the widow herself who outlived her husband by eleven
years and on St Valentines Day 1706 was buried at his side In her
will she says that According to her husbands desire she had given
her deare son Edward a good education and she alsoe did give him all
the Bookes of Musicke in generall the Organ the double spinett the
single spinett a silver tankard a silver watch two pair of gold
buttons a hair ring a mourning ring of Dr Busbys a Larum clock Mr
Edward Purcells picture handsome furniture for a room and he was to
be maintained until provided for All the residue of her property she
gave to her said daughter Frances
Cummings also assails Hawkinss story that Purcell was dissipated and
caught his death from being locked out But Runciman objects that if
Purcell had not been dissipated in those days he would have been called
a Puritan and says I picture him as a sturdy beefeating Englishman
a puissant masterful as well as lovable personality a born king of
men ambitious of greatness determined as Tudway says to excel every
one of his time
The love Frances Purcell bore her husband was kept green by her anxiety
for his fame She was in her littler way a Cosima Wagner In 1696 she
published a collection of harpsichord lessons by her husband three
editions being sold quickly The next year she issued ten sonatas and a
Collection of Ayres In 1698 she issued or reissued the Orpheus
Britannicus In all of these she wrote dedications breathing devotion
to her husband In an ode printed in the second volume of the Orpheus
in 1704 Purcells personality is thus limned
Nor were his Beauties to his Art confind
So justly were his Soul and Body joind
Youd think his Form the Product of his Mind
A conquering sweetness in his Visage dwelt
