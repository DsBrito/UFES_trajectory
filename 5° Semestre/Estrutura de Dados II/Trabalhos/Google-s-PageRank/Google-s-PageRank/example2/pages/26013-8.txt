REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS at the FortyFirst Annual Meeting of the
Northern Nut Growers Association Inc
Held at PLEASANT VALLEY DUTCHESS COUNTY NEW YORK on AUGUST 28 29 and
30 1950
TOGETHER WITH OTHER PAPERS ON NUT CULTURE
MONDAY MORNING SESSION
The meeting was called to order by the VicePresident Dr L H
MacDaniels in the absence of the President
DR MacDANIELS I have here the official gavel of The Northern Nut
Growers Association which was sent to me by Mildred Jones Langdoc who
unfortunately is not able to come to this meeting She of course is
our president She expected to come until fairly recently but on her
doctors orders changed her plans and wrote to me a very short time ago
asking me if I would preside at this meeting
Does anyone present know the history of this gavel
MR GEORGE SLATE It was presented to the Association by Mr Littlepage
and was made from Indiana pecan wood
DR MacDANIELS But anyway here it is and we declare the Association in
session
This morning the meeting is quite brief We will start the meeting with
the report from the Secretary Mr McDaniel
Secretarys Report
J C McDaniel
MR J C McDANIEL My report before the meeting will be very brief It
may be extended a little later for the publication
The last count for this Associations membership made last week shows
the Association has 575 paid members plus 20 subscribers and one
foreign exchange membership totalling 596 There have been a few more
members come in since then so I might say we have in round figures
about 600 members to date in 1950 a few less than last year
I probably owe the members an explanation on the delay in the printing
of the Fortieth Annual Report That was finally taken up by the printing
company and should be printed by now It was ready to put on the
pressin fact some of it was on the press when I left Nashville two
weeks ago and we have every reason to believe that it will be ready for
mailing in about another week The Treasurer said he heard me say that
six months ago Thats six months nearer to being the truth now
I requested that the printer send up two copies whether they are bound
or not so they may be in to show you later during the meeting
I believe thats about all I will say at this time Mr President
DR MacDANIELS This matter of the report not being here I know is the
cause of considerable dissatisfaction and it arises out of our attempt
to get the report printed cheaply We have had the same trouble before
The Corse Press did this at one time and did it cheaply because they
would work it in with the other business The last time they did it and
other business was so heavy that it was delayed
The printers who do it at Nashville also did the Legislative printing
and other things cut in so that it was not carried on Now I think
