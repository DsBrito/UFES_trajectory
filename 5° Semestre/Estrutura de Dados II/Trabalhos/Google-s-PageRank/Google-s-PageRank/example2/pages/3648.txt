state sends its soldiers to crush you Only fifty cents they sayonly
fifty cents most of you miss from your envelopes What is fifty cents to
them But I who speak to you have been hungry I know that fifty cents
will buy ten loaves of bread or three pounds of the neck of pork or six
quarts of milk for the babies Fifty cents will help pay the rent of the
ratholes where you live Once more he was interrupted by angry shouts
of approval And the labour unions have they aided you Why not I will
tell you whybecause they are the servile instruments of the masters
The unions say that capital has rights bargain with it but for us there
can be only one bargain complete surrender of the tools to the workers
For the capitalists are parasites who suck your blood and your childrens
blood From now on there can be no compromise no truce no peace until
they are exterminated It is war War In Janets soul the word
resounded like a tocsin And again as when swept along East Street with
the mob that sense of identity with these people and their wrongs of
submergence with them in their cause possessed her Despite her ancestry
her lot was cast with them She too had been precariously close to
poverty had known the sordidness of life she too and Lise and Hannah
had been duped and cheated of the fairer things Eagerly she had drunk in
the vocabulary of that new and terrible philosophy The master class must
be exterminated Was it not true if she had been of that class that
Ditmar would not have dared to use and deceive her Why had she never
thought of these things before The light was beginning to fade the
great meeting was breaking up and yet she lingered At the foot of the
bandstand steps conversing with a small group of operatives that
surrounded him she perceived the man who had just spoken And as she
stood hesitating gazing at him a desire to hear more to hear all of
this creed he preached that fed the fires in her soul urged her
forward Her need had she known it was even greater than that of these
toilers whom she now called comrades Despite some qualifying reserve she
felt and which had had to do with the redness of his lips he attracted
her He had a mind an intellect he must possess stores of the knowledge
for which she thirsted he appeared to her as one who had studied and
travelled who had ascended heights and gained the wider view denied her
A cynical cosmopolitanism would have left her cold but here apparently
was a cultivated man burning with a sense of the worlds wrongs Ditmar
who was to have led her out of captivity had only thrust her the deeper
into bondage She joined the group halting on the edge of it
listening Rolfe was arguing with a man about the labour unions but
almost at once she knew she had fixed his attention From time to time
as he talked his eyes sought hers boldly and in their dark pupils were
tiny points of light that stirred and confused her made her wonder what
was behind them in his soul When he had finished his argument he
singled her out
You do not work in the mills he asked
No Im a stenographeror I was one
And now
Ive given up my place
You want to join us
I was interested in what you said I never heard anything like it
before
He looked at her intently
Come let us walk a little way he said And she went along by his
side through the Common feeling a neophytes excitement in the
freemasonry the contempt for petty conventions of this newly achieved
doctrine of brotherhood I will give you things to read you shall be
one of us
Im afraid I shouldnt understand them Janet replied Ive read so
little
Oh you will understand he assured her easily There is too much
learning too much reason and intelligence in the world too little
impulse and feeling intuition Where do reason and intelligence lead us
To selfishness to thirst for powerstraight into the master class They
separate us from the mass of humanity No our fight is against those who
claim more enlightenment than their fellowmen who control the public
schools and impose reason on our children because reason leads to
submission makes us content with our station in life The true
syndicalist is an artist a revolutionist he cried
Janet found this bewildering and yet through it seemed to shine for her a
gleam of light Her excitement grew Never before had she been in the
presence of one who talked like this with such assurance and ease And
the fact that he despised knowledge yet possessed it lent him glamour
But you have studied she exclaimed
Oh yes I have studied he replied with a touch of weariness only to
learn that life is simple after all and that what is needed for the
social order is simple We have only to take what belongs to us we who
work to follow our feelings our inclinations
You would take possession of the mills she asked
Yes he said quickly of all wealth and of the government There
would be no governmentwe should not need it A little courage is all
that is necessary and we come into our own You are a stenographer you
say But youyou are not content I can see it in your face in your
eyes You have cause to hate them too these masters or you would not
have been herein this place today Is it not so
She shivered but was silent
Is it not so he repeated They have wronged you too perhapsthey
have wronged us all but some are too stupid too cowardly to fight and
crush them Christians and slaves submit The old religion teaches that
the world is cruel for most of us but if we are obedient and humble we
shall be rewarded in heaven Rolfe laughed The masters approve of that
teaching They would not have it changed But for us it is war Well
strike and keep on striking well break their machinery spoil their
mills and factories and drive them out And even if we do not win at
once it is better to suffer and die fighting than to have the life
ground out of usis it not
Yes it is better she agreed The passion in her voice did not escape
him
Some day perhaps sooner than we think we shall have the true
Armageddon the general strike when the last sleeping toiler shall have
aroused himself from his lethargy to rise up and come into his
inheritance He seemed to detach himself from her his eyes became more
luminous
Like unseen music in the nightso Sorel writes about it They may
scoff at it the wise ones but it will come Like music in the night
You respond to that
Again she was silent They had walked on through familiar streets that
now seemed strange
You respondI can tell he said And yet you are not like these
others like me even You are an American And yet you are not like most
of your countrywomen
Why do you say that
I will tell you Because they are cold most of them and trivial they
do not feel But youyou can feel you can love and hate You look calm
and cold but you are notI knew it when I looked at you when you came
up to me
She did not know whether to resent or welcome his clairvoyance his
assumption of intimacy his air of appropriation But her curiosity was
tingling
And you she asked Your name is Rolfe isnt it
He assented And yours
She told him
You have been in America longyour family
Very long she said But you speak Italian and Rolfe isnt an Italian
name
My father was an Englishman an artist who lived in Italymy mother a
peasant woman from Lombardy such as these who come to work in the mills
When she was young she was beautifullike a Madonna by an old master
An old master
The old masters are the great painters who lived in Italy four hundred
years ago I was named after one of themthe greatest I am called
Leonard He was Leonardo da Vinci
The name as Rolfe pronounced it stirred her And art painting It was
a realm unknown to her and yet the very suggestion of it evoked
yearnings And she recalled a picture in the window of Hartmanns
bookstore a coloured print before which she used to stop on her way to
and from the office the copy of a landscape by a California artist The
steep hillside in the foreground was spread with the misty green of olive
trees and beyondfar beyonda snowcovered peak like some high altar
flamed red in the sunset She had not been able to express her feeling
for this picture it had filled her with joy and sadness Once she had
ventured to enter and ask its priceten dollars And then came a morning
when she had looked for it and it was gone
And your fatherdid he paint beautiful pictures too
Ah he was too much of a socialist He was always away whey I was a
child and after my mothers death he used to take me with him When I
was seventeen we went to Milan to take part in the great strike and
there I saw the soldiers shooting down the workers by the hundreds
putting them in prison by the thousands Then I went to live in England
among the socialists there and I learned the printers trade When I
first came to this country I was on a labour paper in New York I set up
type I wrote articles and once in a while I addressed meetings on the
East Side But even before I left London I had read a book on Syndicalism
by one of the great Frenchmen and after a while I began to realize that
the proletariat would never get anywhere through socialism
The proletariat The word was new to Janets ear
The great mass of the workers the oppressed the people you saw here
today Socialism is not for them Socialismpolitical socialism
betrays them into the hands of the master class Direct action is the
thing the general strike warthe new creed the new religion that
will bring salvation I joined the Industrial Workers of the World that
is the American organization of Syndicalism I went west to Colorado and
California and Oregon I preached to the workers wherever there was an
uprising I met the leaders Ritter and Borkum and Antonelli and Jastro
and Nellie Bond I was useful to them I understand Syndicalism as they
do not And now we are here to sow the seed in the East Come he said
slipping his arm through hers I will take you to Headquarters I will
enlist you you shall be my recruit I will give you the cause the
religion you need
She longed to go and yet she drew back puzzled The man fired and
fascinated her but there were reservations apprehensions concerning
him felt rather than reasoned Because of her state of rebellion of her
intense desire to satisfy in action the emotion aroused by a sense of
wrong his creed had made a violent appeal but in his voice in his
eyes in his manner she had been quick to detect a personal sexual note
that disturbed and alarmed her that implied in him a lack of unity
I cant tonight she said I must go homemy mother is all alone
But I want to help I want to do something
They were standing on a corner under a street lamp And she averted her
eyes from his glance
Then come tomorrow he said eagerly You know where Headquarters is
in the FrancoBelgian Hall
What could I do she asked
You You could help in many waysamong the women Do you know what
picketing is
You mean keeping the operatives out of the mills
Yes in the morning when they go to work And out of the Chippering
Mill especially Ditmar the agent of that mill is the ablest of the
lot Im told Hes the man we want to cripple
Cripple exclaimed Janet
Oh I dont mean to harm him personally Rolfe did not seem to notice
her tone But he intends to crush the strike and I understand hes
importing scabs here to finish out an ordera big order If it werent
for him wed have an easier fight he stiffens up the others Theres
always one man like that in every place And what we want to do is to
make him shut down especially
I see said Janet
Youll come to Headquarters Rolfe repeated
Yes Ill come tomorrow she promised
After she had left him she walked rapidly through several streets not
heeding her directionsuch was the driving power of the new ideas he had
given her Certain words and phrases he had spoken rang in her head and
like martial music kept pace with her steps She strove to remember all
that he had said to grasp its purport and because it seemed recondite
cosmic it appealed to her and excited her the more And he the man
himself had exerted a kind of hypnotic force that partially had
paralyzed her faculties and aroused her fears while still in his
presence her first feeling in escaping had been one of reliefand then
she began to regret not having gone to Headquarters Hadnt she been
foolish In the retrospect the elements in him that had disturbed her
were less disquieting his intellectual fascination was enhanced and in
that very emancipation from cant and convention characteristic of the
Order to which he belonged had lain much of his charm She had attracted
him as a woman there was no denying that He who had studied and
travelled and known life in many lands had discerned in her Janet
Bumpus some quality to make him desire her acknowledge her as a
comrade Tremblingly she exulted in the possession of that quality
whatever it might be Ditmar too had perceived it He had not known
how to value it With this thought came a flaming suggestionDitmar
should see her with this man Rolfe she would make him scorch with the
fires of jealousy Ditmar should know that she had joined his enemies
the Industrial Workers of the World Of the world Her shackles had been
cast off at last And then suddenly she felt tired The prospect of
returning to Fillmore Street to the silent flatmade the more silent by
her mothers tragic presenceoverwhelmed her The ache in her heart
began to throb again How could she wait until the dawn of another
day
In the black hours of the morning with the siren dinning in her ears a
hoarse call to war Janet leaped from her bed and began to dress There
is a degree of cold so sharp that it seems actually to smell and as she
stole down the stairs and out of the door she shivered assailed by a
sense of loneliness and fear Yet an insistent voice urged her on
whispering that to remain at home inactive was to go mad salvation and
relief lay in plunging into the struggle in contributing her share
toward retribution and victory Victory In Faber Street the light of the
electric arcs tinged the snow with blue and the flamboyant
advertisements of breakfast foods cigarettes and ales seemed but the
mockery of an activity now unrealizable The groups and figures scattered
here and there farther down the street served only to exaggerate its wide
emptiness What could these do what could she accomplish against the
mighty power of the mills Gradually as she stood gazing she became
aware of a beating of feet upon the snow over her shoulder she caught
the gleam of steel A squad of soldiers muffled in heavy capes and woolen
caps was marching along the cartracks She followed them At the corner
of West Street in obedience to a sharp command she saw them halt turn
and advance toward a small crowd gathered there It scattered only to
collect again when the soldiers had passed on Janet joined them She
heard men cursing the soldiers The women stood a little aside some were
stamping to keep warm and one with a bundle in her arms which Janet
presently perceived to be a child sank down on a stone step and remained
there crouching resigned
We gotta right to stay here in the street We gotta right to live I
guess The girls teeth were chattering but she spoke with such
vehemence and spirit as to attract Janets attention You worked in the
Chippering like meyes she asked
Janet nodded The faded lemoncoloured shawl the girl had wrapped about
her head emphasized the dark beauty of her oval face She smiled and her
white teeth were fairly dazzling Impulsively she thrust her arm through
Janets
You Americanyou comrade you come to help she asked
Ive never done any picketing
I showa you
The dawn had begun to break revealing little by little the outlines of
cruel ugly buildings the great mill looming darkly at the end of the
street and Janet found it scarcely believable that only a little while
ago she had hurried thither in the mornings with anticipation and joy in
her heart eager to see Ditmar to be near him The sight of two
policemen hurrying toward them from the direction of the canal aroused
her With sullen murmurs the group started to disperse but the woman
with the baby numb with cold was slow in rising and one of the
policemen thrust out his club threateningly
Move on you cant sit here he said
With a lithe movement like the spring of a cat the Italian girl flung
herself between thema remarkable exhibition of spontaneous
inflammability her eyes glittered like the points of daggers and as
though they had been dagger points the policeman recoiled a little The
act which was absolutely natural superb electrified Janet restored in
an instant her own fierceness of spirit The girl said something swiftly
in Italian and helped the woman to rise paying no more attention to the
policeman Janet walked on but she had not covered half the block before
she was overtaken by the girl her anger had come and gone in a flash
her vivacity had returned her vitality again found expression in an
abundant good nature and good will She asked Janets name volunteering
the information that her own was Gemma that she was a fine speeder in
the Chippering Mill where she had received nearly seven dollars a week
She had been among the first to walk out
Why did you walk out asked Janet curiously
Why I get mad when I know that my wages is cut I want the moneyI get
married
Is that why you are striking asked Janet curiously
That is whyof course
Then you havent heard any of the speakers They say it is for a cause
the workers are striking for freedom some day they will own the mills
I heard a man named Rolfe yesterday
The girl gave her a radiant smile
Rolfe It is beautiful what Rolfe said You think so I think so I am
for the cause I hate the capitalist We will win and get more money
until we have all the money We will be rich And you why do you
strike
I was mad too Janet replied simply
Revenge exclaimed the girl glittering again I understan Here come
the scabs Now I show you
The light had grown but the stores were still closed and barred Along
Faber Street singly or in little groups anxiously glancing around them
behind them came the workers who still clung desperately to their jobs
Gemma fairly darted at two girls who sought the edge of the sidewalk
seizing them by the sleeves and with piteous expressions they listened
while she poured forth on them a stream of Italian After a moment one
tore herself away but the other remained and began to ask questions
Presently she turned and walked slowly away in the direction from which
she had come
I get her exclaimed Gemma triumphantly
What did you say asked Janet
Listenthat she take the bread from our mouths she is traditorescab
We strike for them too is it not so
It is no use for them to work for wages that starve We win the strike
we get good wages for all Here comes anothershe is a Jewessyou try
you spik
Janet failed with the Jewess who obstinately refused to listen or reply
as the two walked along with her one on either side Near West Street
they spied a policeman and desisted Up and down Faber Street
everywhere the game went on but the police were watchful and once a
detachment of militia passed The picketing had to be done quickly in
the few minutes that were to elapse before the gates should close
Janets blood ran faster she grew excited absorbed bolder as she
perceived the apologetic attitude of the scabs and she began to despise
them with Gemmas heartiness and soon she had lost all sense of surprise
at finding herself arguing pleading appealing to several women in turn
fluently in the language of the industrial revolution Somebecause she
was an Americanexamined her with furtive curiosity others pretended
not to understand accelerating their pace She gained no converts that
morning but one girl pale anemic with high cheek bones evidently a
Slavlistened to her intently
I gotta right to work she said
Not if others will starve because you work objected Janet
If I dont work I starve said the girl
No the Committee will take care of youthere will be food for all How
much do you get now
Four dollar and a half
You starve now Janet declared contemptuously The quicker you join
us the sooner youll get a living wage
The girl was not quite convinced She stood for a while undecided and
then ran abruptly off in the direction of West Street Janet sought for
others but they had ceased coming only the scattered prowling
picketers remained
Over the black rim of the Clarendon Mill to the eastward the sky had
caught fire The sun had risen the bells were ringing riotously
resonantly in the clear cold air Another working day had begun
Janet benumbed with cold yet agitated and trembling because of her
unwonted experience of the morning made her way back to Fillmore Street
She was prepared to answer any questions her mother might ask as they
ate their dismal breakfast and Hannah asked no questions she longed to
blurt out where she had been to announce that she had cast her lot with
the strikers the foreigners to defend them and declare that these were
not to blame for the misfortunes of the family but men like Ditmar and
the owners of the mills the capitalists Her mother she reflected
bitterly had never once betrayed any concern as to her shattered
happiness But gradually as from time to time she glanced covertly at
Hannahs face her resentment gave way to apprehension Hannah did not
seem now even to be aware of her presence this persistent apathy filled
her with a dread she did not dare to acknowledge
Mother she cried at last
Hannah started Have you finished she asked
Yes
Youve ben out in the cold and you havent eaten much Janet fought
back her tears Oh yes I have she managed to reply convinced of the
futility of speech of all attempts to arouse her mother to a realization
of the situation Perhapsthough her heart contracted at the thought
perhaps it was a merciful thing But to live day after day in the
presence of that comfortless apathy Later in the morning she went
out to walk the streets and again in the afternoon and twice she
turned her face eastward in the direction of the FrancoBelgian Hall
Her courage failed her How would these foreigners and the strange
leaders who had come to organize them receive her Ditmars stenographer
She would have to tell them she was Ditmars stenographer they would
find it out And now she was filled with doubts about Rolfe Had he
really thought she could be of use to them Around the Common in front
of the City Hall men went about their affairs alertly or stopped one
another to talk about the strike In Faber Street indeed an air of
suppressed excitement prevailed newsboys were shouting out extras but
business went on as though nothing had happened to disturb it There was
however the spectacle unusual at this time of day of operatives
mingling with the crowd while policemen stood watchfully at the corners
a company of soldiers marched by drawing the people in silence to the
curb Janet scanned the faces of these idle operatives they seemed for
the most part either calm or sullen wanting the fire and passion of the
enthusiasts who had come out to picket in the early hours of the day she
sought vainly for the Italian girl with whom she had made friends
Despondency grew in her a sense of isolation of lacking any one now
to whom she might turn and these feelings were intensified by the air of
confidence prevailing here The strike was crushed injustice and wrong
had triumphedwould always triumph In front of the Banner office she
heard a man say to an acquaintance who had evidently just arrived in
townThe Chippering Sure thats running By tomorrow Ditmarll
have a full force there Now that the militia has come I guess weve got
this thing scotched
Just how and when that order and confidence of Faber Street began to be
permeated by disquietude and alarm Janet could not have said Something
was happening somewhereor about to happen An obscure apparently
telepathic process was at work People began to hurry westward a few had
abandoned the sidewalk and were running while other pedestrians more
timid were equally concerned to turn and hasten in the opposite
direction At the corner of West Street was gathering a crowd that each
moment grew larger and larger despite the efforts of the police to
disperse it These were strikers angry strikers They blocked the
traffic halted the clanging trolleys surged into the mouth of West
Street booing and cursing at the soldiers whose threatening line of
bayonets stretched across that thoroughfare halfway down toward the
canal guarding the detested Chippering Mill Bordering West Street
behind the companys lodginghouses on the canal were certain low
buildings warehouses and on their roofs tense figures could be seen
standing out against the sky The vanguard of the mob thrust on by
increasing pressure from behind tumbled backward the thin cordon of
police drew nearer and nearer the bayonets while the soldiers grimly
held their ground A voice was heard on the roof a woman in the front
rank of the mob gave a warning shriek and two swift streams of icy water
burst forth from the warehouse parapet tearing the snow from the
cobbles flying in heavy stinging spray as it advanced and mowed the
strikers down and drove them like flies toward Faber Street Screams of
fright curses of defiance and hate mingled with the hissing of the water
and the noise of its impact with the groundlike the tearing of heavy
sailcloth Then from somewhere near the edge of the mob came a single
sharp detonation quickly followed by anotherbelow the watchmen on the
roof a window crashed The nozzles on the roof were raised their
streams sweeping around in a great semicircle bowled down the rioters
below the telltale wisps of smoke and no sooner had the avalanche of
water passed than the policemen who forewarned had sought refuge along
the walls rushed forward and seized a man who lay gasping on the snow
Dazed half drowned he had dropped his pistol They handcuffed him and
dragged him away through the ranks of the soldiers which opened for him
to pass The mob including those who had been flung down bruised and
drenched and who had painfully got to their feet again had backed
beyond the reach of the water and for a while held that ground until
above its hoarse defiant curses was heard from behind the throbbing of
drums
Cossacks More Cossacks
The cry was taken up by Canadians Italians Belgians Poles Slovaks
Jews and Syrians The drums grew louder the pressure from the rear was
relaxed the throng in Faber Street began a retreat in the direction of
the power plant Down that street now in double time came three
companies of Boston militia newly arrived in Hampton bluetaped
gaitered slouchhatted From columns of fours they wheeled into line
and with bayonets at charge slowly advanced Then the boldest of the mob
who still lingered sullenly gave way West Street was cleared and on
the wider thoroughfare the long line of traffic the imprisoned trolleys
began to move again
Janet had wedged herself into the press far enough to gain a view down
West Street of the warehouse roofs to see the water turned on to hear
the screams and the curses and then the shots Once more she caught the
contagious rage of the mob the spectacle had aroused her to fury it
seemed ignominious revolting that human beings already sufficiently
miserable should be used thus As she retreated reluctantly across the
car tracks her attention was drawn to a man at her side a Slovak His
face was white and pinched his clothes were wet Suddenly he stopped
turned and shook his fist at the line of soldiers
The Cossack the politzman belong to the boss the capitalist he
cried We aint got no right to live I say kill the capitalistkill
Ditmar
A man with a deputys shield ran toward them
Move on he said brutally Move on or Ill roil you in And Janet
once clear of the people fled westward the words the foreigner had
spoken ringing in her ears She found herself repeating them aloud Kill
Ditmar as she hurried through the gathering dusk past the power house
with its bottleshaped chimneys and crossed the little bridge over the
stream beside the chocolate factory She gained the avenue she had trod
with Eda on that summer day of the circus Here was the ragpickers shop
the fence covered with bedraggled posters the deserted grandstand of
the baseball park spread with a milkyblue mantle of snow and beyond
the monotonous frame cottages all built from one model Now she descried
looming above her the outline of Torreys Hill blurred and melting into a
darkening sky and turned into the bleak lane where stood the
FrancoBelgian HallHampton Headquarters of the Industrial Workers of
the World She halted a moment at sight of the crowd of strikers
loitering in front of it then went on again mingling with them
excitedly beside the little building Its lines were simple and
unpretentious and yet it had an exotic character all its own differing
strongly from the surrounding houses it might have been transported from
a foreign country and set down here As the home of that odd cooperative
society of thrifty and gregarious Belgians it had stimulated her
imagination and once before she had gazed as now through the yellowed
lanternlike windows of the little store at the women and children
waiting to fill their baskets with the days provisions In the middle of
the building was an entrance leading up to the second floor Presently
she gathered the courage to enter Her heart was pounding as she climbed
the dark stairs and thrust open the door and she stood a moment on the
threshold almost choked by the fumes of tobacco bewildered by the scene
within confused by the noise Through a haze of smoke she beheld groups
of swarthy foreigners fiercely disputing among themselvesapparently on
the verge of actual combat while a sprinkling of silent spectators of
both sexes stood at the back of the hall At the far end was a stage
still set with painted sylvan scenery and seated there alone above
the confusion and the strife with a calmness a detachment almost
disconcerting was a stout man with long hair and a loose black tie He
was smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper which he presently flung
down taking up another from a pile on the table beside him Suddenly one
of the groups shouting and gesticulating surged toward him and made an
appeal through their interpreter He did not appear to be listening
without so much as lowering his newspaper he spoke a few words in reply
and the group retired satisfied By some incomprehensible power he
dominated Panting fascinated loath to leave yet fearful Janet watched
him breathing now deeply this atmosphere of smoke of strife and
