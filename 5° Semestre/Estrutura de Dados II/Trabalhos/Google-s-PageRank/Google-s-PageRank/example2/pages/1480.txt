generation Blood is thicker than water is one of their pet sayings
They cant be happy unless they are always meeting one another Never
were such people for family gatherings which were you a stranger or
sensitive you might think had better not have been gathered together
For during the whole time of their being together they luxuriate in
telling one another their minds on whatever subject turns up and their
minds are wonderfully antagonistic and all their opinions are downright
beliefs Till youve been among them some time and understand them you
cant think but that they are quarrelling Not a bit of it They love
and respect one another ten times the more after a good set family
arguing bout and go back one to his curacy another to his chambers
and another to his regiment freshened for work and more than ever
convinced that the Browns are the height of company
This family training too combined with their turn for combativeness
makes them eminently quixotic They cant let anything alone which they
think going wrong They must speak their mind about it annoying all
easygoing folk and spend their time and money in having a tinker at
it however hopeless the job It is an impossibility to a Brown to leave
the most disreputable lame dog on the other side of a stile Most other
folk get tired of such work The old Browns with red faces white
whiskers and bald heads go on believing and fighting to a green old
age They have always a crotchet going till the old man with the scythe
reaps and garners them away for troublesome old boys as they are
And the most provoking thing is that no failures knock them up or make
them hold their hands or think you or me or other sane people in
the right Failures slide off them like July rain off a ducks back
feathers Jem and his whole family turn out bad and cheat them one
week and the next they are doing the same thing for Jack and when he
goes to the treadmill and his wife and children to the workhouse they
will be on the lookout for Bill to take his place
However it is time for us to get from the general to the particular
so leaving the great army of Browns who are scattered over the whole
empire on which the sun never sets and whose general diffusion I take
to be the chief cause of that empires stability let us at once fix our
attention upon the small nest of Browns in which our hero was hatched
and which dwelt in that portion of the royal county of Berks which is
called the Vale of White Horse
Most of you have probably travelled down the Great Western Railway as
far as Swindon Those of you who did so with their eyes open have been
aware soon after leaving the Didcot station of a fine range of chalk
hills running parallel with the railway on the lefthand side as you go
down and distant some two or three miles more or less from the line
The highest point in the range is the White Horse Hill which you come
in front of just before you stop at the Shrivenham station If you love
English scenery and have a few hours to spare you cant do better
the next time you pass than stop at the Farringdon Road or Shrivenham
station and make your way to that highest point And those who care for
the vague old stories that haunt countrysides all about England will
not if they are wise be content with only a few hours stay for
glorious as the view is the neighbourhood is yet more interesting
for its relics of bygone times I only know two English neighbourhoods
thoroughly and in each within a circle of five miles there is enough
of interest and beauty to last any reasonable man his life I believe
this to be the case almost throughout the country but each has a
special attraction and none can be richer than the one I am speaking of
and going to introduce you to very particularly for on this subject I
must be prosy so those that dont care for England in detail may skip
the chapter
O young England young England you who are born into these racing
railroad times when theres a Great Exhibition or some monster sight
every year and you can get over a couple of thousand miles of ground
for three pound ten in a fiveweeks holiday why dont you know more of
your own birthplaces Youre all in the ends of the earth it seems to
me as soon as you get your necks out of the educational collar for
midsummer holidays long vacations or what notgoing round Ireland
with a return ticket in a fortnight dropping your copies of Tennyson
on the tops of Swiss mountains or pulling down the Danube in Oxford
racing boats And when you get home for a quiet fortnight you turn the
steam off and lie on your backs in the paternal garden surrounded by
the last batch of books from Mudies library and half bored to death
Well well I know it has its good side You all patter French more or
less and perhaps German you have seen men and cities no doubt and
have your opinions such as they are about schools of painting high
art and all that have seen the pictures of Dresden and the Louvre
and know the taste of sour krout All I say is you dont know your own
lanes and woods and fields Though you may be chokefull of science not
one in twenty of you knows where to find the woodsorrel or beeorchis
which grow in the next wood or on the down three miles off or what the
bogbean and woodsage are good for And as for the country legends
the stories of the old gableended farmhouses the place where the last
skirmish was fought in the civil wars where the parish butts stood
where the last highwayman turned to bay where the last ghost was laid
by the parson theyre gone out of date altogether
Now in my time when we got home by the old coach which put us down at
the crossroads with our boxes the first day of the holidays and had
been driven off by the family coachman singing Dulce Domum at the top
of our voices there we were fixtures till black Monday came round We
had to cut out our own amusements within a walk or a ride of home And
so we got to know all the country folk and their ways and songs and
stories by heart and went over the fields and woods and hills again
and again till we made friends of them all We were Berkshire or
Gloucestershire or Yorkshire boys and youre young cosmopolites
belonging to all countries and no countries No doubt its all right I
dare say it is This is the day of large views and glorious humanity
and all that but I wish backsword play hadnt gone out in the Vale of
White Horse and that that confounded Great Western hadnt carried away
Alfreds Hill to make an embankment
But to return to the said Vale of White Horse the country in which the
first scenes of this true and interesting story are laid As I said the
Great Western now runs right through it and it is a land of large rich
pastures bounded by oxfences and covered with fine hedgerow timber
with here and there a nice little gorse or spinney where abideth poor
Charley having no other cover to which to betake himself for miles and
miles when pushed out some fine November morning by the old Berkshire
Those who have been there and well mounted only know how he and the
stanch little pack who dash after himheads high and sterns low with
a breasthigh scentcan consume the ground at such times There being
little ploughland and few woods the Vale is only an average sporting
country except for hunting The villages are straggling queer
oldfashioned places the houses being dropped down without the least
regularity in nooks and outoftheway corners by the sides of shadowy
lanes and footpaths each with its patch of garden They are built
chiefly of good gray stone and thatched though I see that within the
last year or two the redbrick cottages are multiplying for the Vale is
beginning to manufacture largely both bricks and tiles There are lots
of waste ground by the side of the roads in every village amounting
often to village greens where feed the pigs and ganders of the people
and these roads are oldfashioned homely roads very dirty and badly
made and hardly endurable in winter but still pleasant jogtrot roads
running through the great pasturelands dotted here and there with
little clumps of thorns where the sleek kine are feeding with no fence
on either side of them and a gate at the end of each field which makes
you get out of your gig if you keep one and gives you a chance of
looking about you every quarter of a mile
One of the moralists whom we sat under in our youthwas it the great
Richard Swiveller or Mr Stigginssays We are born in a vale and
must take the consequences of being found in such a situation These
consequences I for one am ready to encounter I pity people who
werent born in a vale I dont mean a flat country but a valethat
is a flat country bounded by hills The having your hill always in view
if you choose to turn towards himthats the essence of a vale There
he is for ever in the distance your friend and companion You never
lose him as you do in hilly districts
And then what a hill is the White Horse Hill There it stands right up
above all the rest nine hundred feet above the sea and the boldest
bravest shape for a chalk hill that you ever saw Let us go up to the
top of him and see what is to be found there Ay you may well wonder
and think it odd you never heard of this before but wonder or not as
you please there are hundreds of such things lying about England which
wiser folk than you know nothing of and care nothing for Yes its a
magnificent Roman camp and no mistake with gates and ditch and mounds
all as complete as it was twenty years after the strong old rogues left
it Here right up on the highest point from which they say you can see
eleven counties they trenched round all the tableland some twelve or
fourteen acres as was their custom for they couldnt bear anybody to
overlook them and made their eyrie The ground falls away rapidly on
all sides Was there ever such turf in the whole world You sink up to
your ankles at every step and yet the spring of it is delicious There
is always a breeze in the camp as it is called and here it lies
just as the Romans left it except that cairn on the east side left by
her Majestys corps of sappers and miners the other day when they and
the engineer officer had finished their sojourn there and their surveys
for the ordnance map of Berkshire It is altogether a place that you
wont forget a place to open a mans soul and make him prophesy as
he looks down on that great Vale spread out as the garden of the Lord
before him and wave on wave of the mysterious downs behind and to the
right and left the chalk hills running away into the distance along
which he can trace for miles the old Roman road the Ridgeway the
Rudge as the country folk call it keeping straight along the highest
back of the hillssuch a place as Balak brought Balaam to and told him
to prophesy against the people in the valley beneath And he could not
neither shall you for they are a people of the Lord who abide there
And now we leave the camp and descend towards the west and are on
the Ashdown We are treading on heroes It is sacred ground for
Englishmenmore sacred than all but one or two fields where their bones
lie whitening For this is the actual place where our Alfred won his
great battle the battle of Ashdown Aescendum in the chroniclers
which broke the Danish power and made England a Christian land The
Danes held the camp and the slope where we are standingthe whole crown
of the hill in fact The heathen had beforehand seized the higher
ground as old Asser says having wasted everything behind them from
London and being just ready to burst down on the fair Vale Alfreds
own birthplace and heritage And up the heights came the Saxons as
they did at the Alma The Christians led up their line from the
lower ground There stood also on that same spot a single thorntree
marvellous stumpy which we ourselves with our very own eyes have
seen Bless the old chronicler Does he think nobody ever saw the
single thorntree but himself Why there it stands to this very day
just on the edge of the slope and I saw it not three weeks sincean
old single thorntree marvellous stumpy At least if it isnt the
same tree it ought to have been for its just in the place where the
battle must have been won or lostaround which as I was saying the
two lines of foemen came together in battle with a huge shout And in
this place one of the two kings of the heathen and five of his earls
fell down and died and many thousands of the heathen side in the same
place  After which crowning mercy the pious king that there might
never be wanting a sign and a memorial to the countryside carved out
on the northern side of the chalk hill under the camp where it is
almost precipitous the great Saxon White Horse which he who will may
see from the railway and which gives its name to the Vale over which
it has looked these thousand years and more

Right down below the White Horse is a curious deep and broad gully
called the Manger into one side of which the hills fall with a series
of the most lovely sweeping curves known as the Giants Stairs They
are not a bit like stairs but I never saw anything like them anywhere
else with their short green turf and tender bluebells and gossamer
and thistledown gleaming in the sun and the sheeppaths running along
their sides like ruled lines
The other side of the Manger is formed by the Dragons Hill a curious
little round selfconfident fellow thrown forward from the range
utterly unlike everything round him On this hill some deliverer of
mankindSt George the country folk used to tell mekilled a dragon
Whether it were St George I cannot say but surely a dragon was killed
there for you may see the marks yet where his blood ran down and more
by token the place where it ran down is the easiest way up the hillside
Passing along the Ridgeway to the west for about a mile we come to a
little clump of young beech and firs with a growth of thorn and privet
underwood Here you may find nests of the strong down partridge and
peewit but take care that the keeper isnt down upon you and in the
middle of it is an old cromlech a huge flat stone raised on seven or
eight others and led up to by a path with large single stones set up
on each side This is Wayland Smiths cave a place of classic fame now
but as Sir Walter has touched it I may as well let it alone and refer
you to Kenilworth for the legend
The thick deep wood which you see in the hollow about a mile off
surrounds Ashdown Park built by Inigo Jones Four broad alleys are cut
through the wood from circumference to centre and each leads to one
face of the house The mystery of the downs hangs about house and wood
as they stand there alone so unlike all around with the green slopes
studded with great stones just about this part stretching away on all
sides It was a wise Lord Craven I think who pitched his tent there
Passing along the Ridgeway to the east we soon come to cultivated land
The downs strictly so called are no more Lincolnshire farmers have
been imported and the long fresh slopes are sheepwalks no more but
grow famous turnips and barley One of these improvers lives over there
at the Seven Barrows farm another mystery of the great downs There
are the barrows still solemn and silent like ships in the calm sea
the sepulchres of some sons of men But of whom It is three miles from
the White Horsetoo far for the slain of Ashdown to be buried there
Who shall say what heroes are waiting there But we must get down into
the Vale again and so away by the Great Western Railway to town
for time and the printers devil press and it is a terrible long and
slippery descent and a shocking bad road At the bottom however there
is a pleasant public whereat we must really take a modest quencher for
the down air is provocative of thirst So we pull up under an old oak
which stands before the door
What is the name of your hill landlord
Blawing STWUN Hill sir to be sure
READER Stuym
AUTHOR Stone stupidthe Blowing Stone
And of your house I cant make out the sign
Blawing Stwun sir says the landlord pouring out his old ale from a
Toby Philpot jug with a melodious crash into the longnecked glass
What queer names say we sighing at the end of our draught and
holding out the glass to be replenished
Beant queer at all as I can see sir says mine host handing back
our glass seeing as this here is the Blawing Stwun his self putting
his hand on a square lump of stone some three feet and a half high
perforated with two or three queer holes like petrified antediluvian
ratholes which lies there close under the oak under our very nose We
are more than ever puzzled and drink our second glass of ale wondering
what will come next Like to hear un sir says mine host setting
down Toby Philpot on the tray and resting both hands on the Stwun We
are ready for anything and he without waiting for a reply applies his
mouth to one of the ratholes Something must come of it if he doesnt
burst Good heavens I hope he has no apoplectic tendencies Yes here
it comes sure enough a gruesome sound between a moan and a roar and
spreads itself away over the valley and up the hillside and into the
woods at the back of the house a ghostlike awful voice Um do say
sir says mine host rising purplefaced while the moan is still
coming out of the Stwun as they used in old times to warn the
countryside by blawing the Stwun when the enemy was acomin and as
how folks could make un heered then for seven mile round leastways so
Ive heered Lawyer Smith say and he knows a smart sight about them old
times We can hardly swallow Lawyer Smiths seven miles but could the
blowing of the stone have been a summons a sort of sending the fiery
cross round the neighbourhood in the old times What old times Who
knows We pay for our beer and are thankful
And whats the name of the village just below landlord
Kingstone Lisle sir
Fine plantations youve got here
Yes sir the Squires mazing fond of trees and such like
No wonder Hes got some real beauties to be fond of Goodday
landlord
Goodday sir and a pleasant ride to ee
And now my boys you whom I want to get for readers have you had
enough Will you give in at once and say youre convinced and let me
begin my story or will you have more of it Remember Ive only been
over a little bit of the hillside yetwhat you could ride round easily
on your ponies in an hour Im only just come down into the Vale by
Blowing Stone Hill and if I once begin about the Vale whats to stop
me Youll have to hear all about Wantage the birthplace of Alfred and
Farringdon which held out so long for Charles the First the Vale was
near Oxford and dreadfully malignantfull of Throgmortons Puseys
and Pyes and such like and their brawny retainers Did you ever read
Thomas Ingoldsbys Legend of Hamilton Tighe If you havent you ought
to have Well Farringdon is where he lived before he went to sea
his real name was Hamden Pye and the Pyes were the great folk at
Farringdon Then theres Pusey Youve heard of the Pusey horn which
King Canute gave to the Puseys of that day and which the gallant old
squire lately gone to his rest whom Berkshire freeholders turned out
of last Parliament to their eternal disgrace for voting according to
his conscience used to bring out on high days holidays and bonfire
nights And the splendid old cross church at Uffington the Uffingas
town How the whole countryside teems with Saxon names and memories
And the old moated grange at Compton nestled close under the hillside
where twenty Marianas may have lived with its bright waterlilies
in the moat and its yew walk the cloister walk and its peerless
terraced gardens There they all are and twenty things beside for
those who care about them and have eyes And these are the sort of
things you may find I believe every one of you in any common English
country neighbourhood
Will you look for them under your own noses or will you not Well
well Ive done what I can to make you and if you will go gadding over
half Europe now every holidays I cant help it I was born and bred
a westcountry man thank God a Wessex man a citizen of the noblest
Saxon kingdom of Wessex a regular Angular Saxon the very soul of me
adscriptus glebae Theres nothing like the old countryside for me
and no music like the twang of the real old Saxon tongue as one gets
it fresh from the veritable chaw in the White Horse Vale and I say with
Gaarge Ridler the old westcountry yeoman
Throo aall the waarld owld Gaarge would bwoast
Commend me to merry owld England mwoast
While vools gwoes prating vur and nigh
We stwops at whum my dog and I
Here at any rate lived and stopped at home Squire Brown JP for the
county of Berks in a village near the foot of the White Horse range
And here he dealt out justice and mercy in a rough way and begat sons
and daughters and hunted the fox and grumbled at the badness of
the roads and the times And his wife dealt out stockings and calico
shirts and smock frocks and comforting drinks to the old folks with
the rheumatiz and good counsel to all and kept the coal and clothes
clubs going for yuletide when the bands of mummers came round
dressed out in ribbons and coloured paper caps and stamped round the
Squires kitchen repeating in true singsong vernacular the legend of
St George and his fight and the tenpound doctor who plays his
part at healing the Sainta relic I believe of the old Middleage
mysteries It was the first dramatic representation which greeted the
eyes of little Tom who was brought down into the kitchen by his nurse
to witness it at the mature age of three years Tom was the eldest
child of his parents and from his earliest babyhood exhibited the
family characteristics in great strength He was a hearty strong boy
from the first given to fighting with and escaping from his nurse and
fraternizing with all the village boys with whom he made expeditions
all round the neighbourhood And here in the quiet oldfashioned
country village under the shadow of the everlasting hills Tom Brown
was reared and never left it till he went first to school when nearly
eight years of age for in those days change of air twice a year was not
thought absolutely necessary for the health of all her Majestys lieges
I have been credibly informed and am inclined to believe that the
various boards of directors of railway companies those gigantic jobbers
and bribers while quarrelling about everything else agreed together
some ten years back to buy up the learned profession of medicine body
and soul To this end they set apart several millions of money which
they continually distribute judiciously among the doctors stipulating
only this one thing that they shall prescribe change of air to every
patient who can pay or borrow money to pay a railway fare and see
their prescription carried out If it be not for this why is it that
none of us can be well at home for a year together It wasnt so twenty
years ago not a bit of it The Browns didnt go out of the country once
in five years A visit to Reading or Abingdon twice a year at assizes
or quarter sessions which the Squire made on his horse with a pair
of saddlebags containing his wardrobe a stay of a day or two at some
country neighbours or an expedition to a county ball or the yeomanry
review made up the sum of the Brown locomotion in most years A stray
Brown from some distant county dropped in every now and then or from
Oxford on grave nag an old don contemporary of the Squire and were
looked upon by the Brown household and the villagers with the same sort
of feeling with which we now regard a man who has crossed the Rocky
Mountains or launched a boat on the Great Lake in Central Africa The
White Horse Vale remember was traversed by no great roadnothing but
country parish roads and these very bad Only one coach ran there and
this one only from Wantage to London so that the western part of the
Vale was without regular means of moving on and certainly didnt
seem to want them There was the canal by the way which supplied the
countryside with coal and up and down which continually went the long
barges with the big black men lounging by the side of the horses along
the towingpath and the women in brightcoloured handkerchiefs standing
in the sterns steering Standing I say but you could never see whether
they were standing or sitting all but their heads and shoulders being
out of sight in the cozy little cabins which occupied some eight feet of
the stern and which Tom Brown pictured to himself as the most desirable
of residences His nurse told him that those goodnaturedlooking women
were in the constant habit of enticing children into the barges and
taking them up to London and selling them which Tom wouldnt
believe and which made him resolve as soon as possible to accept the
oftproffered invitation of these sirens to young master to come in
and have a ride But as yet the nurse was too much for Tom
Yet why should I after all abuse the gadabout propensities of my
countrymen We are a vagabond nation now thats certain for better
for worse I am a vagabond I have been away from home no less than five
distinct times in the last year The Queen sets us the example we are
moving on from top to bottom Little dirty Jack who abides in Clements
Inn gateway and blacks my boots for a penny takes his months
hoppicking every year as a matter of course Why shouldnt he Im
delighted at it I love vagabonds only I prefer poor to rich ones
Couriers and ladiesmaids imperials and travelling carriages are an
abomination unto me I cannot away with them But for dirty Jack and
every good fellow who in the words of the capital French song moves
about
Comme le limacon
Portant tout son bagage
Ses meubles sa maison
on his own back why good luck to them and many a merry roadside
adventure and steaming supper in the chimney corners of roadside inns
Swiss chalets Hottentot kraals or wherever else they like to go So
having succeeded in contradicting myself in my first chapter which
gives me great hopes that you will all go on and think me a good fellow
notwithstanding my crotchets I shall here shut up for the present
and consider my ways having resolved to sar it out as we say in the
Vale holus bolus just as it comes and then youll probably get the
truth out of me

As that venerable and learned poet whose voluminous works we all think
it the correct thing to admire and talk about but dont read often
most truly says The child is father to the man a fortiori
therefore he must be father to the boy So as we are going at any rate
to see Tom Brown through his boyhood supposing we never get any farther
which if you show a proper sense of the value of this history there
is no knowing but what we may let us have a look at the life and
environments of the child in the quiet country village to which we were
introduced in the last chapter
Tom as has been already said was a robust and combative urchin and at
the age of four began to struggle against the yoke and authority of his
nurse That functionary was a goodhearted tearful scatterbrained
girl lately taken by Toms mother Madam Brown as she was called from
the village school to be trained as nurserymaid Madam Brown was a rare
trainer of servants and spent herself freely in the profession for
profession it was and gave her more trouble by half than many people
take to earn a good income Her servants were known and sought after for
miles round Almost all the girls who attained a certain place in the
village school were taken by her one or two at a time as housemaids
laundrymaids nurserymaids or kitchenmaids and after a year or twos
training were started in life amongst the neighbouring families with
good principles and wardrobes One of the results of this system was the
perpetual despair of Mrs Browns cook and own maid who no sooner had
a notable girl made to their hands than missus was sure to find a good
place for her and send her off taking in fresh importations from the
school Another was that the house was always full of young girls with
clean shining faces who broke plates and scorched linen but made an
atmosphere of cheerful homely life about the place good for every one
who came within its influence Mrs Brown loved young people and in
fact human creatures in general above plates and linen They were more
like a lot of elder children than servants and felt to her more as a
mother or aunt than as a mistress
Toms nurse was one who took in her instruction very slowlyshe seemed
to have two left hands and no head and so Mrs Brown kept her on longer
than usual that she might expend her awkwardness and forgetfulness upon
those who would not judge and punish her too strictly for them
Charity Lamb was her name It had been the immemorial habit of the
village to christen children either by Bible names or by those of the
cardinal and other virtues so that one was for ever hearing in the
village street or on the green shrill sounds of Prudence Prudence
thee cum out o the gutter or Mercy drat the girl what bist thee
adoin wi little Faith and there were Ruths Rachels Keziahs
in every corner The same with the boys they were Benjamins Jacobs
Noahs Enochs I suppose the custom has come down from Puritan times
There it is at any rate very strong still in the Vale
Well from early morning till dewy eve when she had it out of him in
the cold tub before putting him to bed Charity and Tom were pitted
against one another Physical power was as yet on the side of Charity
but she hadnt a chance with him wherever headwork was wanted This
war of independence began every morning before breakfast when Charity
escorted her charge to a neighbouring farmhouse which supplied the
Browns and where by his mothers wish Master Tom went to drink whey
before breakfast Tom had no sort of objection to whey but he had a
decided liking for curds which were forbidden as unwholesome and there
was seldom a morning that he did not manage to secure a handful of hard
curds in defiance of Charity and of the farmers wife The latter good
soul was a gaunt angular woman who with an old black bonnet on the
top of her head the strings dangling about her shoulders and her
gown tucked through her pocketholes went clattering about the dairy
cheeseroom and yard in high pattens Charity was some sort of niece
of the old ladys and was consequently free of the farmhouse and
garden into which she could not resist going for the purposes of gossip
and flirtation with the heirapparent who was a dawdling fellow never
out at work as he ought to have been The moment Charity had found her
cousin or any other occupation Tom would slip away and in a minute
shrill cries would be heard from the dairy Charity Charity thee lazy
huzzy where bist and Tom would break cover hands and mouth full of
curds and take refuge on the shaky surface of the great muck reservoir
in the middle of the yard disturbing the repose of the great pigs Here
he was in safety as no grown person could follow without getting over
their knees and the luckless Charity while her aunt scolded her from
the dairy door for being allus hankering about arter our Willum
instead of minding Master Tom would descend from threats to coaxing
to lure Tom out of the muck which was rising over his shoes and would
soon tell a tale on his stockings for which she would be sure to catch
it from missuss maid
Tom had two abettors in the shape of a couple of old boys Noah and
Benjamin by name who defended him from Charity and expended much time
upon his education They were both of them retired servants of former
generations of the Browns Noah Crooke was a keen dry old man of almost
ninety but still able to totter about He talked to Tom quite as if he
were one of his own family and indeed had long completely identified
