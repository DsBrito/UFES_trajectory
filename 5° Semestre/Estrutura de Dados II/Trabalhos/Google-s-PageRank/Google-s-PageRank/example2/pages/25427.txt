Look before you leap is a good motto for everybodyfor children as
well as for men and women If Kate had thought of it perhaps she would
have saved herself and her mother a great deal of trouble
She did not mind where she stepped and put her foot upon a beautiful
sweetscented peony which had just come out of the ground She broke
the stem short off and crushed the root all in pieces
Now this flower was very highly prized by Mrs Lamb for she had
brought it from a great distance and it was the only one of the kind
in Riverdale at that time
Kate was very fond of flowers herself and when she saw the mischief she
had done she cried with anger and vexation She would not have spoiled
this peony for a great deal for she had looked forward with much
pleasure to the time when it should bud and blossom and fill the garden
with its fragrance
What is the matter with you Kate called her mother from the house
when she heard Kate crying
I did not mean to do it mother sobbed the poor girl
Didnt mean to do what Kate said her mother rushing into the garden
to find out what mischief had been done
Mrs Lamb was very angry when she saw that the peony was spoiled and
she took Kate by the arm and shook her I dont think this shaking did
any good but it was a great trial to her to see her favorite flower
destroyed
You careless girl said Mrs Lamb
I didnt mean to mother replied Kate
But you were careless as you always are Will you never learn to be
careful You walk about the flower beds as though they were solid
rocks
I did not mean to tread upon it was all that poor Kate could say
It was very true that she did not mean to spoil the peony but it was
almost as bad to ruin it by being careless Children ought to understand
that not meaning to do wrong is not a good excuse when the wrong might
have been prevented by being careful
Suppose the captain of a ship should run his vessel on the rocks and
lose a dozen lives by being careless do you think people would be
willing to trust him with another vessel afterwards
Suppose the engineer should neglect to keep watch of the boiler and it
should burst would not people blame him Would they think it a good
excuse if he said he did not mean to let it burst
If the man who has the keeping of a powder house should smoke a pipe in
it and twenty persons should be killed by his carelessness do you
think it would be enough for him to say he did not intend to kill them
When we go on the water in a sailing vessel or a steamer when we ride
on a railroad in a stage or wagon our lives depend on the carefulness
with which the vessel railroad or carriage is managed People dont
excuse them when lives are lost because they did not mean to kill
anybody
You are liable to lose your life every day by the carelessness of some
one The house in which you are to sleep on a cold winters night may be
burned down by the neglect of those who take care of the fires
The careless use of a lamp might destroy many lives and much property
If you play with fire though you do not mean any harm you may burn the
house in which you live and perhaps destroy the lives of your friends
A little carelessness may produce dreadful results The want of thought
for a few moments may do more mischief than you can repair in a whole
lifetime
Kate Lamb was not a bad girl at heart She loved her parents and her
friends as much as any little girl but she often gave them a great deal
of trouble and sadness by her carelessness
She was so thoughtless that she had come to be called Careless Kate
It was a bad fault and it sometimes led her to commit worse ones as my
story will show
Now Kate come into the house and next time when I call come at
once said her mother If you had minded me perhaps my flower would
not have been spoiled
I will be more careful next time mother replied Kate
I hope you will I think you have done sufficient mischief by being
careless and I hope you will soon begin to do better
I will try mother
Very likely she meant to try just then while she was smarting under
her mothers rebuke and while she was still sad at the loss of the
flower but she had promised to do better so many times that her mother
could hardly believe her again
I want you to carry this quart of milk down in the meadow to poor Mrs
OBrien said Mrs Lamb as she handed her a tin kettle And you must
go quick for it is almost dark now
It wont take me long mother
But you must be very careful and not spill any of the milk
I will be very careful
Mrs OBrien is sick and has two small children This milk is for
their supper
That is the woman whose husband was killed on the railroad last
summerisnt it mother
Yes and she is very poor She is sick now and not able to work The
neighbors have all sent milk to her for her children and a great many
other things Now go just as fast as you can but be very careful and
not spill the milk

Kate put on her bonnet and taking the pail of milk hastened towards
the house of the poor sick woman But she had gone but a little way when
she met Fanny Flynn who was an idle girl and very fond of mischief
Where are you going Kate asked Fanny
I am going down to Mrs OBriens with some milk
Give me a drinkwill you
I cant it is for the poor widows children I suppose they wont have
any supper till they get this milk
Yes they will I wont drink but a little of it
No I cant give you any It would not be right for me to do so
Pooh You neednt pretend to be so good all at once You are no better
than I am
I didnt say I was Only I shall not give you any of this milk when it
is for the poor womans children so you neednt ask me replied Kate
with a great deal of spirit
Some people think when they do any thing that is right they ought to
make a great parade over it but this only shows that they are not much
in the habit of doing right and they wish to get all the credit they
can for it
It was so with Kate She ought to have been content with merely doing
her duty without talking large about it Fanny felt that she was just
as good as Kate and she was angry when the latter made a needless show
of her intention to do what she believed to be right
I dont want it said Fanny
What did you ask me for it for then You wanted to make me do
something that was wrong
Illustration FANNY AND KATE
You are not always so nice sneered Fanny
I dont mean to do wrong anyhow as some folks do
Do you mean me
No matter whom I mean
Fanny was so angry that she walked up to Kate and pulled her shaker
down over her face She also used some naughty words when she did so
which I will not repeat
Kate in her turn was very angry with the saucy girl and wanted to
pay her for what she had done But Fanny did not wait for any reply
and ran away just as fast as she could
It would have been much better for Kate if she had let her go but she
was so angry she could not do this she wanted to strike back again
Without thinking of the milk in the pail she started to run after the
naughty girl
For a few moments she ran with all her might and had nearly caught
Fanny when a stone tripped her up and she fell upon the ground
Then she thought of the milk and tried to save it but the cover of the
kettle came off and it was all spilled on the ground
The fall did not hurt her but the laugh with which her misfortune was
greeted by Fanny roused a very wicked spirit in her heart and dropping
the pail which she had picked up she pursued her
But the naughty girl had the start of her and though she followed her a
good way she could not overtake her Then she stopped in the path and
cried with anger and vexation The thought of the milk which had been
spilled was after all the worst part of the affair
Walking back to the place where the accident had happened she picked
up the pail again and began to think what she should do It was of no
use now for her to go to Mrs OBriens She had no milk for the
childrens supper
What would her mother say to her if she should return home and tell her
she had spilled all the milk She had told her to be careful and she
felt that she had been very careless
It was not necessary that she should chase the naughty girl whatever
she said and she could not help seeing that she had been very careless
While she was thinking about it Ben Tinker came along He lived in the
next house to Mr Lamb and the children were well acquainted with each
other
What is the matter with you Kate asked Ben when he saw that her
eyes were red and her face was wet with tears
I have just spilled a pailful of milk on the ground sobbed Kate
O well its no use to cry for spilled milk laughed Ben
I was carrying it to Mrs OBrien
No matter she will get along very well without it
That ugly Fanny Flynn struck me on the head and thats what made me
spill the milk
Didnt you hit her back
I couldnt catch her she ran away I was chasing her when I fell down
and spilled the milk
You can catch her some time when you do give it to her
But Kate had got over her anger and heartily wished she had not
attempted to catch Fanny Besides she very well knew that Ben was
giving her bad advice
That passage from the New Testament If any man smite thee on the one
cheek turn to him the other also came to her mind and she felt how
wicked it was to harbor a desire for revenge
The loss of the milk and what would follow when she went home gave her
more trouble than the injury she had received from the naughty girl
I dont know what I shall do said she beginning to cry again as she
thought of her mother
Do you cant do any thingcan you The milk is gone and all you have
to do is to go home replied Ben
What will my mother say
No matter what she says if she dont whip you or send you to bed
without your supper
She wont whip me and I have been to supper
Then what are you crying about
Mother says I am very careless and I know I am whined Kate
Dont be a baby Kate
I spoiled a flower this afternoon and mother scolded me and shook me
for it She told me to be very careful with this milk and now I have
spilled the whole of it
Well if you feel so bad why need you tell her any thing about it
About what asked Kate looking up into his face for she did not
quite understand him
You neednt tell her you spilled the milk She will never find it out
But she will ask me
What if she does Cant you tell her you gave the milk to the old
woman and that she was very much obliged to her for sending it
I can do that said Kate
She did not like the plan but it seemed to her just then that any thing
would be better than telling her mother that she had spilled the milk
and wicked as it was she resolved to do it
Illustration CRYING FOR SPILLED MILK
III
Kate did not think of the poor woman and her hungry children when she
made up her mind to tell her mother such a monstrous lie
She did not think how very wicked it was to deceive her mother just to
escape perhaps a severe rebuke for her carelessness
She felt all the time that she was doing wrong but she tried so hard
to cover it up that her conscience was not permitted to do its whole
duty
When we are tempted to do wrong something within us tells us not to do
it but we often struggle to get rid of this feeling and if we succeed
the first time it is easier the next time And the more we do wrong
the easier it becomes to put down the little voice within us
It was so with Kate She had told falsehoods before or it would not
have been so easy for her to do it this time If we do not take care of
our consciences as we do of our caps and bonnets they are soon
spoiled
Did you ever notice that one of the wheels on your little wagon when it
becomes loose soon wears out The more it sags over on one side the
weaker it grows While the wheel stands up straight it does not seem
to wear out at all
It is just so with your conscienceyour power to tell right from wrong
While you keep it up straight it works well and never wears out But
when it gets a little out of order it grows worse very fast and is not
of much more value than a lighthouse without any light in it
Kates conscience had begun to sag over on one side It was growing
weak and did not remind her of her wrong deeds with force enough to
make itself heeded If she could only escape the reproof of her mother
she did not care
Thus moved by the wicked counsel of Ben Tinker she hastened home She
tried to look as if nothing had happened but her eyes were still very
red from crying and her mother wanted to know what had made her cry
Fanny Flynn struck me and pulled my shaker over my face replied
Kate
What did she do that for
She asked me to give her a drink of the milk and because I wouldnt
she struck me answered Kate placing her pail upon the kitchen table
She is a naughty girl and I will go and see her mother about it What
did she say to you
She asked me for a drink of the milk
What did you answer
I told her it was for Mrs OBriens children and that it wouldnt be
right for me to give it to her and I would not
Well I will see to that I think it is a pity if I cant send one of
my children out on an errand of charity without her being treated in
this manner She shall suffer for it
She is a naughty girl mother and I never mean to speak to her again
as long as I live said Kate with much apparent earnestness
You did right not to give her any of the milk and I am glad you did
not I am happy that my daughter has been brave enough to do right and
even to suffer for doing it You are a good girl Kate
I meant to be mother
What did Mrs OBrien say when you gave her the milk continued Mrs
Lamb
She said she was much obliged to you replied Kate not daring to look
her mother in the face
Did you see the children
Yes mother
Mrs Lamb was going to ask more questions about the family but
something called her attention away and Kate was saved from telling
more falsehoods
She took a book and tried to read but she could not for she did not
feel like a good girl The little voice within told her how wicked she
had been and she began to wish that she had not deceived her mother
While she sat with the book in her hand her father came home and her
mother told him what Fanny Flynn had done He was very angry when he had
heard the story and asked Kate a great many questions about the affair
You did well Kate and I am glad you were so brave and so smart
said Mr Lamb
Of course I could not give her any of the milk when it was for the
poor widows hungry children
You did right Kate repeated her father The poor children might
have had to go to bed hungry if you had given up the milk to that bad
girl
I know it father
Only think what a sad thing it would have been if the poor little ones
had been sent hungry and crying to bed That Fanny Flynn must be taken
care of When little girls get to be so bold as that it is high time
something was done
I think so too father
It is time for you to go to bed now Kate said her mother
I am ready mother for I am tired as I can be
Kate was glad to get away from her father and mother for while they
were praising her for her good conduct she knew very well that she did
not deserve it
What would her parents think if they knew that she had spilled all the
milk on the ground What would they say to her if they found out that
she had told them so many lies
The more she thought of her conduct the more she felt that she had done
wrong She now saw that if she had returned home and told her mother
the truth she would have excused the fault and sent another pail of
milk to the poor sick womans hungry children
She wished she had done so for it would have been a great deal better
to be scolded for her carelessness than to feel as guilty as she now
felt She was sure that it was far better to suffer a great deal than to
do even a little wrong
She was not satisfied either that her mother would have scolded her if
she had stated the whole truth to herthat Fanny Flynn had made her
spill the milk
She went to bed but when her mother bade her good night and took the
lamp in her hand she begged her to leave it for she did not like to be
alone in the dark
It seemed just as though a wicked spirit was tormenting her and though
she was in the habit of going to sleep without a light the darkness was
terrible to her at this time She did not even wish to be left alone
but she dared not ask her mother to stay with her
When Mrs Lamb had gone out Kate covered her face wholly under the
bedclothes and shut her eyes as close as she could trying in this
manner to go to sleep But her guilty conscience gave her no rest
Then she opened her eyes and looked around the room but every thing in
the chamber seemed to mock and reproach her Again and again she shut
her eyes and tried to sleep
The little voice within would speak now in the silence of her chamber
She had never felt so bad before perhaps because she had never been so
wicked before Do you want to know why she suffered so much It was
because she could not keep from her mind those hungry crying children

Illustration KATE TELLS THE WHOLE STORY
IV
Poor Kate She had certainly never been so wicked in her life before
The words of her father still lingered in her ears and she could almost
hear the moans of those hungry crying children
She had never been sent to bed in her life without her supper and it
looked like a dreadful thing to herperhaps even more dreadful than it
really was
If there had been nothing but the falsehoods she had told she might
have gone to sleep but it was sad to think that she had deprived the
poor children of their supper and sent them hungry to bed This seemed
to be the most wicked part of her conduct
I do not know how many times she turned over in the bed nor how many
times she pulled the clothes over her eyes to shut out the sad picture
of those hungry and crying children that would come up before her in
spite of all she could do to prevent it
She tried to think of other thingsof the scene with Fanny of her
school of a picnic party she had attended on the first of May of
almost every thing indeed but it did no good The poor children could
not be banished from her mind
Kate had been sick with the measels with the scarlet fever and the
mumps and she remembered how bad she felt at these times but it seemed
to her now that she would rather have all these diseases at once than
suffer from a guilty conscience
When she was sick her mother bent over her and pitied her and did all
she could to ease her pain and even when she was burning with fever
and racked with pain she felt happier than she did now
She could not inform her mother how bad she felt for that would expose
her guilt She heard the clock strike nine and every moment appeared to
her like an hour Those poor little children constantly haunted her
whether her eyes were open or shut still she saw them crying and heard
them moaning and begging their sick mother to give them some supper
O Kate how severely was she punished for the sin she had committed
Her mother and her father had praised her but still she was unhappy
Slowly very slowly the time passed away and she heard the clock
strike ten She could endure her sufferings no longer and she burst
into tears sobbing and moaning as if her heart would break
For some time she cried but as her distress increased she sobbed and
moaned so loud that her father and mother who were in the adjoining
room heard her and hastened into the room to find out what ailed her
What is the matter my child anxiously asked her mother Havent you
been asleep since you went to bed
No mother sobbed Kate
What ails you Are you sick
No mother
What are you crying for then
O mother
Why what ails you child Have you been frightened
No mother
Tell us what ails you Kate added her father
Both of her parents were greatly alarmed about her for they loved
their little girl very much and they knew that something must ail her
or she would not have lain awake so long or have cried so bitterly
Cant you tell us what ails you Kate inquired her mother very
tenderly
I have been very naughty mother replied Kate almost choking with
emotion
Naughty child
Yes mother
I thought you had been very good added Mr Lamb
No I have not I have been very wicked and you will never forgive
me
Why what have you done Kate How strange you act my child
I cant help it mother If you will forgive me this time I will never
be so wicked again while I live
Tell us all about it Kate and we will forgive you said her father
very kindly
The poor girl sobbed so that she could not speak for some time for the
tenderness of her parents made her feel a great deal worse than if they
had scolded her severely
What have you done Kate repeated Mrs Lamb
I didnt carry the milk to Mrs OBrien mother gasped the poor
penitent as she uncovered her eyes and looked up in the face of her
parents to notice the effect of her confession upon them
Didnt carry it to her was the exclamation of her father and mother
at the same time
No I spilled it on the ground
Why Kate what did you do that for
I couldnt help itI mean I was careless When Fanny Flynn struck me
I ran after her My foot tripped and I fell and spilled all the
milk
Why didnt you tell me so Kate
I didnt dare to tell you I was afraid you would scold at me as you
did for spoiling the peony
Kate felt a little better now that she had confessed her fault and she
was able to look her parents in the face
Why Kate if you had only told me I should not have scolded you You
may have been careless but it was all the fault of Fanny Flynn
No mother I was careless I forgot all about the milk I was so
angry
And so the poor children had no supper after all added Mr Lamb
O father It was what you said about them that made me feel so bad I
am sure I shall never be so very wicked again Let me carry them some
milk now
What are you talking about It is after ten oclock my child
No matter father I am not afraid to go in the dark if I can only
carry them their supper
No no Kate I will carry them the milk though it is rather late and
probably they are all asleep by this time
But will you forgive me father and mother
Freely my child you have suffered severely already for your fault
and I hope it will be a lesson to you which will last as long as you
live said her father
It will said Kate earnestly
Both her parents kissed her in token of their forgiveness and Mr Lamb
put on his coat while Mrs Lamb went to the cellar for a pail of milk
with which he soon left the house on his errand of kindness and charity
Kate felt a great deal better then and before her father returned she
was fast asleep Mr Lamb found the poor woman still up The children
had had bread and water but no milk for their supper and she was very
glad to have some for them when they waked up in the night And she was
very grateful to Mr Lamb for thinking of her at that hour and thanked
God for giving her such kind and thoughtful friends
From that time Kate was a better girl and tried hard to reform her
life and character She tried so hard and succeeded so well that she
very soon lost the name of Careless Kate
Illustration KATE A BETTER GIRL
Mr Lamb went to see Fanny Flynns parents the next day and they
promised to punish her for her conduct After that Kate did not provoke
her and they never had any more trouble
Now my readers have seen that Kates fault led her into falsehood and
deception which are worse than carelessness and I hope they will all
learn to be careful and truthful
NOTHING TO DO
My kitty is purring
Upon the hearth rug
Rolled up in a bundle
Just like a great bug
I wonder what kitty
Is thinking about
What makes her so happy
I cannot find out
She has no hard lessons
To bother her brain
No spelling and reading
To study in vain
She ought to be happy
With nothing to do
But play all the morning
And I should be too
Thus Nellie kept thinking
And spoke out her thought
The words which she uttered
Her mothers ear caught
You wish to be idle
Like kitty dear there
And play all the morning
Or sleep in your chair
I dont like my lessons
I think tis a pity
I cant be as happy
As dear little kitty
That ugly old spelling
I never can learn
O into a kitty
I wish I could turn
I am not a fairy
Her mother replied
To me all the power
Of magics denied
But you may be idle
From morning till night
And see if do nothing
Will set your case right
O shall I do nothing
But play all day long
And sing with my kitty
A holiday song
How happy and merry
And joyous twill be
To have no hard lessons
From study be free
Do what will best please you
Be idle all day
Recite no more lessons
Do nothing but play
Then Nellie rejoicing
Flew out of the room
Played hide horse and dolly
And rode on the broom
But long before dinner
Poor Nell had played out
And studied and studied
And wandered about
To find some new pleasure
