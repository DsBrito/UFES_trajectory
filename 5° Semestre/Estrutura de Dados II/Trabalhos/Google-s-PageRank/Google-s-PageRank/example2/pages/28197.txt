THE TRIAL OF CRANDALL presents the first case of a man charged with
endeavoring to excite insurrection among slaves and the free colored
population that was ever brought before a judicial tribunal It lasted
ten days before the whole Court and was as closely contested as any
trial on record by the counsel on both sides Every point of law was
fully and strenuously argued and carefully considered by the Court
and where no statutes have been enacted this case may be considered
as settling the legal questions touching the rights of the slaveholding
population on the one hand to protect themselves from foreign
influence and the circumstances on the other hand which may bring
people from the nonslaveholding States into danger of the law by having
in their possession showing or circulating papers and tracts which
advocate the abolition of slavery in such a way as to excite slaves and
free people of color to revolt and violate the existing laws and customs
of the slaveholding States No trial has ever occurred more important to
travellers from the North or to the domestic peace of the inhabitants
of the Southern States
THE TRIAL
OF
REUBEN CRANDALL M D
ON A CHARGE OF
CIRCULATING INCENDIARY PAPERS
UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT
District of Columbia Friday April 15th 1836
PRESENT
CRANCH chief justice THRUSTON and MORSELL justices
F S KEY district attorney and J M CARLISLE for the prosecution
R S COXE and J H BRADLEY for the defence
John H King Nicholas Callan James Kennedy Walter Clarke George
Crandall William Waters Thomas Hyde Thomas Fenwick Samuel Lowe
George Simmes Wesley Stevenson and Jacob Gideon jr were empannelled
and sworn as jurors to try the issue
This was an indictment charging in five counts and in various forms
the offence under the common law of libels of publishing malicious and
wicked libels with the intent to excite sedition and insurrection among
the slaves and free colored people of this District The three first
counts only having been relied upon and no evidence having been offered
under the others an abstract omitting the mere formal part will be
sufficient to show the nature of the libels charged
1st The first count charged the defendant with publishing a libel
containing in one part thereof these words Then we are not to meddle
with the subject of slavery in any manner neither by appeals to the
patriotism by exhortation to humanity by application of truth to
the conscience No even to propose in Congress that the seat of
our republican Government may be purified from this crying abomination
under penalty of a dissolution of the Union
And in another part thereof in an article entitled Reply to Mr Gurleys
letter addressed to the Rev R R Gurley Secretary of the American
Colonization Society Washington city signed by Arthur Tappan and
others the following words We will not insult your understanding sir
with any labored attempt to prove to you that the descendants of African
parents born in this country have as good a claim to a residence in it
as the descendants of English German Danish Scotch or Irish parents
You will not attempt to prove that every native colored person you meet
in the streets has not the same right to remain in this his native land
that you and we have Assuming this as an incontrovertable truth we
hold it selfevident that they have as good right to deport us to Europe
under the pretext that there we shall be prosperous and happy as we have
to deport them to Africa on a similar plea
And in another part thereof in the said reply the following words
In what language could the unrighteous principles of denying freedom
to colored people in this country which amounts to the same thing as
demanding the expulsion of those already free be more effectually and
yet more plausibly inculcated than in those very words of Gen Harper
you have with so much approbation quoted to us
And in another part thereof in the said reply the following words
Against this doctrine of suspending emancipation upon the contingency
or condition of expatriation we feel bound to protest because we
believe that every man has a right to reside in his native country if he
chooses and that every mans native country is the country in which he
was bornthat no mans right to freedom is suspended upon or taken
away by his desire to remain in his native countrythat to make a
removal from ones own native country a sine qua non of setting him
free when held in involuntary bondage is the climax of moral absurdity
And in another part thereof in a certain other article entitled Three
months residence or seven weeks on a sugar plantation by Henry
Whitby containing the most shocking and disgusting details of cruel
inhuman and immoral treatment of slaves by the owners and overseers
and attorneys or agents of proprietors according to the tenor and
effect followingthat is to say On this and other occasions I thought
it my duty to acquaint the attorney with my observations and feelings
in regard to the cruel floggings and severe treatment generally which
I have witnessed at New Ground He admitted the facts but said that
plantation work could not be carried on without the cartwhip He
moreover labored hard to convince me that the flogging did not injure
the health of the negroes I also told him of the exceeding immorality
and licentiousness which I had witnessed mentioning in substance the
facts previously detailed He replied that that was a thing which they
must wink at If a man in manners so much the gentleman and in other
respects so estimable was necessarily led to countenance or wink at
the enormities I have feebly attempted to describe what I ask is to
be expected from its subordinate administrators who are continually
exposed to the demoralizing influences of slavery what indeed but
the frightful wickedness and cruelty which are its actual fruitsin
contempt of the laws to the disturbance of the public peace to the
evil example of all others and against the peace and government of
the United States
2d The second count charges the publication of another libel
containing among other things in one part thereof the following
words viz Our plan of emancipation is simply thisto promulgate
the doctrine of human rights in high places and low places and all
places where there are human beingsto whisper it in chimney corners
and to proclaim it from the house tops yea from the mountain topsto
pour it out like water from the pulpit and the pressto raise it up
with all the force of the inner man from infancy to grey hairsto
give line upon line precept upon precept till it forms one of the
foundation principles and parts indestructible of the public soul
And in another part thereof the following viz I meaning the said
Crandall am not unaware that my remarks may be regarded by many as
dangerous and exceptionable that I may be regarded as a fanatic for
quoting the language of eternal truth and denounced as an incendiary
for maintaining in the spirit as well as the letter the doctrines
of American Independence But if such are the consequences of a simple
performance of duty I shall not regard them If my feeble appeal but
reaches the hearts of any who are now slumbering in iniquity if it
shall have power given it to shake down one stone from that foul temple
where the blood of human victims is offered to the moloch of slavery
if under Providence it can break one fetter from off the image of
God and enable one suffering African
To feel
The weight of human misery less and glide
Ungroaning to the tomb
I shall not have written in vain my conscience will be satisfied Far
be it from me to cast new bitters in the gall and wormwood waters of
sectional prejudice No I desire peacethe peace of universal loveof
catholic sympathythe peace of common interesta common feelinga
common humanity But so long as slavery is tolerated no such peace can
exist Liberty and slavery cannot dwell in harmony together There will
be a perpetual war in the members of the political Mezentiusbetween
the living and the dead God and man have placed between them an
everlasting barrieran eternal separation No matter under what law
or compact their union is attempted the ordination of Providence has
forbidden itand it cannot stand Peace there can be no peace between
justice and oppressionbetween robbery and righteousnesstruth and
falsehoodfreedom and slavery The slaveholding States are not free
The name of Liberty is there but the spirit is wanting They do not
partake of its invaluable blessings
Wherever slavery exists to any considerable extent with the exception
of some recently settled portions of the country and which have not
yet felt in a great degree the baneful and deteriorating influence of
slave laborwe hear at this moment the cry of suffering We are told
of grassgrown streetsof crumbling mansionsof beggared planters and
barren plantationsof fear from withoutof terror within The once
fertile fields are wasted and tenantless for the curse of slaverythe
improvidence of that laborer whose hire has been kept back by fraudhas
been there poisoning the very earth beyond the reviving influence of
the early and the latter rain A moral mildew mingles with and blasts
the economy of nature It is as if the finger of the everlasting God had
written upon the soil of the slaveholder the language of his displeasure
Let then the slaveholding States consult their present interest by
beginning without delay the work of emancipation If they fear not
and mock at the fiery indignation of Him to whom vengeance belongeth
let temporal interest persuade them They know they must know that
the present state of things cannot long continue Mind is the same
every where no matter what may be the complexion of the frame which
it animates there is a love of liberty which the scourge cannot
eradicate A hatred of oppression which centuries of degradation cannot
extinguish The slave will become conscious sooner or later of his
strengthhis physical superiorityand will exert it His torch will be
at the threshold and his knife at the throat of the planter Horrible
and indiscriminate will be the vengeance Where then will be the pride
the beauty and the chivalry of the South The smoke of her torment will
rise upward like a thick cloud visible over the whole earth
3d The third count charged the defendant with publishing twelve other
libels in which are represented and exhibited several disgusting
prints and pictures of white men in the act of inflicting with whips
cruel and inhuman beatings and stripes upon young and helpless and
unresisting black children and inflicting with other instruments
cruel and inhuman violence upon slaves and in a manner not fit and
proper to be seen and represented calculated and intended to excite
the good people of the United States in said county to violence against
the holder of slaves in said county as aforesaid and calculated and
intended to excite the said slaves in said county to violence and
rebellion against their said masters in said county in contempt of the
laws to the disturbance of the public peace to the evil example of all
others and against the peace and government of the United States
All these counts contained averments that at the time of the publication
of these libels the citizens of the United States residing in the
county of Washington in the District of Columbia were lawfully
authorized to hold slaves as property and many of them did so hold
themand that many free persons of color also reside in the District
and that the defendant unlawfully maliciously and seditiously
contriving and intending to traduce vilify and bring into hatred
and contempt among the citizens of the United States the laws and
government of the United States in the county of Washington as duly
established and in force and to inflame and excite the people of the
United States to resist and oppose and disregard the laws and Government
aforesaid and the rights of the proprietors of slaves in the said
county and to inflame and excite to violence against the said
proprietors of the said slaves not only the ignorant and ill disposed
among the free people of the United States and the free persons of color
in the said county but also the slaves and to produce among the said
slaves and free persons of color insubordination violence and
rebellion and to stir up war and insurrection between the said slaves
and their said masters published the said libels containing among
other things divers false malicious and seditious matters of and
concerning the laws and Government of the United States in the said
District and of and concerning the citizens of the United States
holding slaves in the said District and of and concerning the said
slaves and free persons of color and their labor services and
treatment and the state of slavery in the said District
The defendant pleaded not guilty
The District Attorney opened the case for the Government He said
this was a serious and important charge of publishing inflammatory
and seditious libels which was always an indictable offence In this
particular case situated as the population of the District is it
was peculiarly dangerous and atrocious In point of law it would be
necessary to prove a publication that the prisoner did in some way
or other exhibit or circulate one or more of the libels and with that
view he should connect evidence that he was found with many similar
libels of a most dangerous and inflammatory tendency with the words
read and circulate upon them in writing which Crandall admitted to
be his own handwriting and that he gave different and contradictory
accounts of how he came by them and how they came here in his
possession Also that similar libels were dropped into the postoffice
and sent by nobody could tell whom to almost every body in the
District After proving these facts he said he should carry the libels
before the jury and let them judge whether the prisoner could have been
here with any good motive or have such a mass of obnoxious papers with
any good purpose
Mr Coxe wished to state at the outset what he understood to be the
law The libels charged were not upon individuals nor the Government
but were said to be designed to excite the whole community and
therefore publication or circulation with the intent charged would
be necessary to sustain the prosecution Possession however bad or
dangerous the libels might be was no crime any man might have and keep
the worst libels with entire innocence and in this case it would be
no evidence of malicious or dangerous intent that he loaned or gave one
to respectable individuals who would not be injured and would not do
any injury to others
Henry King testified that about last June or July he knew Crandall in
Georgetown where he came and took an office as a botanist and followed
that business
Key handed him a pamphlet and asked if he had seen any like it
stating upon objection being made by Coxe that his object was to show
that Crandall gave the witness such a paper to read
Coxe objected to the testimony as furnishing no ground of inference
that the act of publication by giving the paper to a respectable white
free man was intended to create excitement or was the result of a
malicious intent
Key said he would connect this with other circumstances to show the
intent It was proper evidence to go to the jury and they must judge
what the intent really was
The Court ruled that the evidence was admissible and
Henry King went on to testify He was in Crandalls office in
Georgetown some time in July last Received from Dr Crandall a
pamphlet similar to the one now shown him called the AntiSlavery
Reporter There was something written on it but cant say what it
was He left it at Linthicums store Some one took it away from the
store and it was lost
Judge Morsell Did Crandall make any remark when you took the
pamphlet
Witness No Witness was looking at the botanical preparations in the
office and seeing this and other tracts on the subject of abolition
lying about he took up one and remarked the latitude is too far south
for these things they wont do here but by your leave I will
take this and read it over Crandall was at the time engaged in taking
out preparations of plants from a large trunk There were three of these
pamphlets on the table but dont know whether they were taken from
the trunk or not Crandall used newspapers or something like them as
wrappers for the preserved plants Witness is not a slaveholder himself
Witness after looking over the pamphlet threw it on the desk in
Linthicums store and afterwards threw it under the counter When the
excitement arose looked for it and could not find it Had thought
nothing about it till then Did not remember what words were written
on the pamphlet Crandall did not call his attention to the tracts
He asked Crandall for the pamphlet as a loan and took it away with
Crandalls leave Crandall never asked for it afterwards He saw
something written on the pamphlet and recollects that Crandall at his
examination in the jail admitted the words please read and circulate
to have been written by himself He saw in Crandalls shop two or
three of them not more than three The plants were enveloped in large
newspapers Crandall had been in Georgetown about three weeks or a
month at this time Witness was frequently in the shop Crandall was
much engaged in gathering and preserving plants
Key proposed to read from the pamphlet
Coxe objected that the publication with the malicious intent charged
had not been proved and that it was necessary before going into any
other evidence to make out the fact of publication The paper could not
be read to show the intent when no evidence of publication is offered
to show such a publication as is charged and he cited various
authorities of no interest to the general reader
Key argued that possession alone of a known published libel was
evidence of publication sufficient to call upon the defendant to show
how he came by it The intent was to be inferred from the character of
the libel and the evidence he had already given was sufficient prima
facia evidence to put the prisoner to his defence and allow the libel
to be read to the jury He meant to show other circumstances which would
show the intent If the evidence of having given one to a witness and
having in possession a bundle of other similar libels was not enough
then a man has only to keep them on hand and take care not to give them
away but he may tell every body that he has them and advertise them
from one end of the country to the other and may give them to every
body who chooses to call for them without any danger from the law
The Court called King again when he stated that Crandall permitted
him to take away the pamphlet at his request reluctantly that it was
a private office without any sign or indication of business or any
thing shown for sale at the windows nor any thing for sale in the shop
The pamphlets might have been thrown down in the confusion of unpacking
and he never saw but three persons in the shop which was usually kept
locked Crandall was mostly out collecting plants and he once saw him
describing some specimens to Mr Cruickshank and Doctor King he
understood Crandall had given out that he was about to teach botany
The counsel for the defence here contended that this was not sufficient
evidence of malicious publication The delivery to King was no more than
simple possession in the eye of the law and was compatible with entire
innocence and possession alone was no offence
Key cited a number of authorities to show that prima facia evidence
of publication only was necessary to let the libel go to the jury
Here was a publicationthe jury must judge of the intentwith the
handwriting of the prisoner endorsed with the words read and
circulate and he made the point that when a libel is printed and
a copy is found in possession of the prisoner it is prima facia
evidence to allow the libel to be read To prove that the words were
on the libel given to King in the prisoners handwriting he called
William Robinson who testified that he saw the pamphlet which King
said he got of Crandall in Linthicums shop and that the words read
and circulate were written on it
The Court deeming this to be prima facia evidence of publication
permitted the pamphlet to be read to the jury or so much thereof as
either party might think proper to be read and pertinent to the issue
Key was about to read the libel
Coxe objected that it was not the libel proved to have been given
to King for that was lost
King was called again and said the paper he had was lost how or where
he did not know but he identified the one handed to him as an exact
copy of the same pamphlet but said he could not say what writing was
on the one he had He might have remembered if he had not seen some with
and some without writing
C T Coote was one of the examining magistrates in the jail when
Crandall was arrested He recollected that King pointed out one with
the writing on as similar to the one he had and that Crandall admitted
the writing to be his
B K Morsell another of the magistrates recollected that King
stated distinctly that the words read and circulate were on the paper
when he got it and that Crandall said it was his handwriting but he
did not recollect Crandalls saying it was put on a year before
The question was here raised and argued by the counsel on both sides
whether any evidence could be given of any libels except those of which
the publication was proved unless they referred distinctly to the
libels charged in the indictment
The Court was of opinion that the United States could not give in
evidence to the jury for the purpose of proving the intent of the
defendant in publishing the libel stated in the first count any papers
subsequently published by the defendant or found in his possession
unpublished by him which would be libels and might be substantive
subjects of public prosecution if published
Thruston J differed with the majority and delivered the following
opinion
There are five counts in the indictment charging in various ways
the publishing by the traverser of sundry libels with intent to create
sedition and excite insurrection among the slaves and free blacks The
first count in the indictment charges the publication of a certain
libel not otherwise described or set out in the count than by
selecting certain paragraphs in the supposed libellous pamphlet and
setting them out severally in the count To this count only and to the
libellous matter charged thereon has any evidence of publication been
given The Attorney for the United States has moved the court to be
permitted to give in evidence to the jury other printed pamphlets of
the same character and on the same subject and which the traverser
acknowledged to represent his sentiments as evidence of malice on
the part of the traverser in the publication of the libel in the first
count the libel in the first count being one of those which with the
others now asked to be given in evidence the traverser acknowledged
contained his sentiments
That is that it is competent to prove malice in the publication of one
libel by others found in the possession of the traverser on the same
subject of which no proof of publication has been offered The motion
to admit the said alleged libellous pamphlets in evidence has been
supported by no precedent or adjudged case but from analogies drawn
from proceedings in other cases and from the expediency or necessity
of punishing the enormous crime of which the defendant stands accused
enormous we all admit the crime to be if substantiated but which
judges cannot punish but under the rules and principles of law Enormous
as the offence is it is questionable whether from public considerations
it is not better that the accused should escape punishment than that
the law should be perverted to obtain his conviction
There being no authorities cited to sustain the motion of the Attorney
for the United States we have no other guide to enlighten and direct
us than the established principles and rules of law in criminal
proceedings I take it to be well settled that in indictments for
libels publication is the gist and essence of the crime that having
in ones possession one or more seditious or libellous writings whether
written or printed if their contents be not communicated or made known
to one or more persons then the possessor is not criminal in a legal
point of view It is true that Hawkins was cited to prove that having
in ones possession a known published libel is prima facie evidence
of publication against such possessors admitting this authority it
seems not to touch the case before us unless those libels were
published within this District They purport on the face of them to
have been printed in New York and there published so far as sending
them abroad within that state from the printing office and putting
them into the hands of others amounts to a publication within this
District and no evidence has been offered that the traverser ever
distributed a single copy or imparted their contents to any person
within this District saving the one charged in the first count Hawkins
surely did not mean that having a copy of a libel published in a foreign
country in ones possession was evidence of publication in another
state or country where the possessor of such copy may be found for
example a libel against the British government printed and published
in France would be no publication in England to charge a person found
in England with one or more copies of such libels in his possession
with the guilt of publishing such libel against the laws of England
It is true in times of great excitement in England when the rebellious
principles of France were gaining ground and endangering the very
existence of the government the Scottish courts did condemn and send
to Botany bay Muir and Palmer for having in their possession a printed
copy of Thomas Paines Rights of Man It is very long since I read the
case indeed shortly after we first obtained the information of their
trial and shortly indeed after the trial but I have never heard the
judgment of the court in their case spoken of but with reprobation I
cannot remember the particulars of the case The evidence was that the
book had been reprinted and published in Great Britain If so that case
is stronger than that of having a printed copy in possession of a libel
published only in a foreign country and so far if such be the fact it
is sustained by the dictum in Hawkins but this dictum is not itself
sustained as far as I could judge from the authorities cited at the
bar from Hawkins himself nor by any adjudged case I think I may
boldly assert then that the merely having in possession a libel
printed and published in a foreign country only is not an indictable
offence here and publication of the same libel here
Let us then examine how far these alleged libels which although not
subjects of criminal prosecution here can be made use of to sustain the
publication or prove or aid in proving the criminal intent or malice
in the publication of another libel charged in the first count and of
the publication of which some evidence has been offered to the jury Now
the libels in the first count of which evidence of publication has been
given to the jury is of itself libellous or it is not if it be
libellous and published the law deduces the criminal intent from the
libellous matter itself and therefore requires no aid from other
libellous writings to sustain it if it be not libellous it cannot be
made so by showing other libellous writings of the traverser of which
he is not accused or charged in the indictment I mean the libellous
matter itself in the libel is in the eye of the law proof of criminal
intent if it be published unless the traverser can rebut this
inference of law by proving his innocence of any criminal intent by
some sufficient excuse as that some person stole the copy from him and
published it without his knowledge or consent But the Attorney for the
United States urged that these pamphlets indicating the one charged in
the first count contained or expressed opinions which coincided with
his sentiments on the subject matter of them and this was urged as a
reason for admitting them in evidence This in my view amounts to
nothing more than that he appropriated to himself and adopted the
thoughts of others What proof could this appropriation or adoption
afford of a malicious intent in their publication Every man has an
unquestionable right to his own moral or religious sentiments there
is no crime in this it would be criminal to restrain any man in this
country in his own or in adopting the moral or religious opinions of
others if he please it is criminal only when he attempts to propagate
them and only when they have a tendency to disturb the peace of
societyto invade the general rights of propertyand are most
essentially criminal if they have a tendency to produce the dreadful
results charged in the indictment But bad as the tendency of those
writings may be and unquestionably are if truly portrayed in the
indictment I know not how much less danger would result if led away
by our feelings we bend the rules and principles of law from expediency
or the supposed political necessity of convicting the accused The present
crisis may pass without leaving any dangerous consequences behind it The
good sense and virtue of the people and the fear of punishment in
transgressors will check the progress of these alarming doctrines but
if we invade the panoply which the law has provided for the protection
of the accused against arbitrary or vindictive judgments we establish
precedents the evil consequences of which cannot be calculated The
criminal intent then does not consist in the writing or possession of
a written or printed libel but in the publishing it It is not easy to
conceive how the criminal intent of publishing one libel can be proved
by the having in possession other libels not published any more than
you would be permitted to prove a man guilty of stealing one horse
because you might prove that he had a propensity to horsestealing But
you would not be allowed to introduce such proof The quo animo with
which a horse is taken is as necessary in an indictment for horse
stealing as for publishing a libel Now as I observed before if the
matter of the pamphlet charged in the first count in the indictment is
libellous does not the acknowledgment of the traverser that the
sentiment in the several pamphlets coincided with his own embrace in it
the sentiments in the pamphlets charged in the first count and of which
evidence has been offered of publication If so does not this libel of
itself afford sufficient evidence of malice without resorting to the
matter of other pamphlets not charged Then why resort to them The
traverser was not apprised from this first count that he was
responsible for any libel or libellous matter except what was contained
in the libel set out in said count If you are permitted in order to
prove malice in publishing the libel in the first count to read to the
jury the libellous matter of other alleged libels what will be the
consequence The matter in those other libels may be of a more
aggravated or inflammatory character than in that set out in the first
count Is it not evident if such be the case that the jury may be
influenced to convict the traverser not by the matter of the libel with
which he is charged but from that of other libels with which he is not
charged Surely if malice in the publication of a libel be an inference
of law that inference must be drawn only from the libel charged and
published not from other writings which are not libellous because not
published As I observed before if the paper charged in the first count
be of itself libellous the criminal intent of publication is to be
inferred from the confession of the traverser that he approved of the
sentiments contained in it If such inference can be drawn from such
confession it can as well be sustained from the matter of this libel as
from that of any number of others and there is no need to resort to
them for such inference if the matter of such papers be not libellous
no number of other libels found in the traversers possession however
