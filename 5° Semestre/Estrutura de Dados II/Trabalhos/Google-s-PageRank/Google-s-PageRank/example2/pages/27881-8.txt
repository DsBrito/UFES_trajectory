AN EMBARRASSMENT OF CHATEAUX
HOTEL FLORENCE BELLAGIO August 10th
YOU will be surprised dear Margaret to have a letter from me here
instead of from Touraine We fully intended to go directly from the
Dolomites and Venice to Milan and on to Tours stopping a day or two in
Paris en route but Miss Cassandra begged for a few days on Lake Como
as in all her travels by sea and shore she has never seen the Italian
lakes We changed our itinerary simply to be obliging but Walter and I
have had no reason to regret the change for one minute
Beautiful as you and I found this region in June I must admit that its
August charms are more entrancing and pervasive Instead of the clear
blues greens and purples of June the light haze that veils the
mountain tops brings out the same indescribable opalescent shades of
heliotrope azure and rose that we thought belonged exclusively to the
Dolomites However these mountains are first cousins once or twice
removed to the Eastern Italian and Austrian Alps and have a good right
to a family likeness There is something almost intoxicating in the
ethereal beauty of this lake something that goes to ones head like
wine I dont wonder that poets and artists rave about its charms of
which not the least is its infinite variety The scene changes so
quickly The glow of color fades a cloud obscures the sun the blue and
purple turn to gray in an instant and we descend from a hillside
garden where gay flowers gain added brilliancy from the sun to a
cypressbordered path where the grateful shade is so dense that we walk
in twilight and listen to the liquid note of the nightingale or the
blackcap whose song is sometimes mistaken for that of his more
distinguished neighbor
This morning when we were resting in a hillside pavilion near the Villa
Giulia gazing upon the sapphire lake and the line of purple Alps
beyond we concluded that nothing was needed to complete the beauty of
the scene but a snow mountain in the distance when lo as if in
obedience to our call a cloud that shrouded some faroff peaks slowly
lifted revealing to us the shining crest of Monte Rosa It really
seemed as if Monte Rosa had amiably thrown up that dazzling white
shoulder for our especial delectation This evening at sunset it will be
touched with delicate pink
I am writing this afternoon on one of the long tables so conveniently
placed on the upper deck of the little steamers upon which we made so
many excursions when you and I were here in June The colors of sky
mountain and lake are particularly lovely at this time of the day Miss
Cassandra and Lydia have taken out their water colors and are trying to
put upon paper the exquisite translucent shades of the mountains that
surround the lake Lydia says that the wash of water colors reproduces
these atmospheric effects much more faithfully than the solid oils and
she and our Quaker lady are washing away at their improvised easels
having sent the children off for fresh glasses of water While I write
to you Walter lights his cigar and gives himself up to day dreams and
I shall soon say au revoir and devote myself to the same delightful
if unprofitable occupation as this fairy lake is the place of all
others in which to dream and lead the dolce far niente life of Italy
And so we float about in boats as at Venice and think not of the
morrow By we I mean Walter Lydia and myself as the children and Miss
Cassandra are fatiguingly energetic She has just reminded me that there
is something to do here beside gazing at these picturesque shores from a
boat as there are numerous villas to be visited to most of which are
attached gardens of marvellous beauty We are passing one just now which
has a water gate over which climbing geraniums have thrown a veil of
bloom The villa itself is of a delicate salmon color and the garden
close to the lake is gay with many flowers petunias and pink and white
oleanders being most in evidence The roses are nearly over but other
flowers have taken their places and the gardens all along the shore
make brilliant patches of color
It is not strange that Bulwer chose this lake as the site of Melnottes
chateau en Espagne for surely there could not be found a more fitting
spot for a romance than this deep vale
Shut out by Alpine hills from the rude world
Near a clear lake margined by fruits of gold
And whispering myrtles glassing softest skies
We were wondering what golden fruits were to be found on these shores
at this time oranges and nespoli being out of season when some boatmen
in a small fishing smack began to sing the Santa Lucia beloved by the
Neapolitans A handsome middleaged woman seated near us touched to
tears by the penetrating sweetness of the song as it reached us across
the waters and with the camaraderie induced by the common hap of
travel has just whispered in my ear that her husband proposed to her at
Bellagio I fancied the happy pair floating about in a boat with a
beautiful brown and yellow sail but the lady has destroyed my picture
by telling me that she was over in New York at the time It appears that
a timid and somewhat uncertain admirer the kind that we read about in
oldfashioned novels as he strolled by the shores of the lake at
twilight heard a boatman singing her favorite song and the melody of
Santa Lucia floating forth upon the still air coupled with the beauty
of the scene so wrought upon his feelings that he forthwith wrote her a
love letter by the flickering light of a bougie This little incident
dates back to the more romantic if less comfortable days before
electricity came to light our way even in remote places
August 11th
There are so many chateaux to be visited and so many excursions on the
lake to be made that we could stay here a month and have a charming plan
for each day This morning we climbed a winding mountain path to the
Villa Serbelloni and wandered through the hillside garden with its
grottoes and tunnels to a natural balcony overhanging a precipice of
sheer rock that rises above the lake From this height there is a view
of the whole northern part of Lake Como with the Alps beyond and here
one realizes the beauty of Bellagio which along the water front is but a
long line of shops Situated on the extreme end of the point of land
that separates Lake Como from its southern arm the Lago di Lecco the
little town rises upon its terraces and with its steep narrow streets
and winding paths is as picturesque as only an Italian hillside
villagio can be
On this Punta di Bellagio is situated one of the numerous villas of the
younger Pliny another villa we saw near the curious intermittent
spring which he described in his letters This Larian Lake as the
ancients called it is full of classic associations and of those of a
later time connected with Italys heroic struggle for independence for
the Villa Pliniana was once the home of the heroic and beautiful
Princess Christina Belgiojoso the friend of Cavour and Garibaldi who
equipped a troop of Lombardy volunteers which she herself commanded
until she was banished from Italy by order of the Austrian general
Gazing upon the blue lake on whose shining bosom the rocky shores were
so charmingly mirrored today it was difficult to believe that great
storms ever sweep over its still waters yet habitues of this region
tell us that this Punta di Bellagio is the centre of furious storms the
most violent coming from behind Monte Crocione back of Cadenabbia and
sweeping with great fury across the lake Such a storm as this was the
memorable one of 1493 upon whose violence chroniclers of the time
delighted to descant This particular tempest which was probably no
more severe than many others found a place in history and romance
because its unmannerly waters tossed about the richly decorated barge of
Bianca Sforza whose marriage to Maximilian King of the Romans had
been solemnized with great magnificence at the cathedral in Milan
three days before The bridal party set forth from Como in brilliant
sunshine the shores crowded with men and women in holiday attire and
the air filled with joyous music Biancas barge was rowed by forty
sailors says Nicolo da Correggio while her suite followed in thirty
boats painted and decked out with laurel boughs and tapestries This
gay cortege reached Bellagio in safety and after a night spent at a
castle on the promontory the bride and her attendants set sail toward
the upper end of the lake Hardly had they left the shore when the
weather changed and a violent storm scattered the fleet in all
directions Biancas richly decorated barge with her fine
hundredthousandducat trousseau aboard was tossed about as mercilessly
as if it had been a fishermans smack The poor young Queen and her
ladies wept and cried aloud to God for mercy Giasone del Maino says
the chronicler alone preserved his composure and calmly smiled at the
terror of the courtiers while he besought the frightened boatmen to
keep their heads Happily the tempest subsided toward nightfall and
the Queens barge with part of her fleet succeeded in putting back
into the harbor of Bellagio The following day a more prosperous start
was made and poor Bianca was saved from the terrors of the deep to make
another perilous journey this time across the Alps on muleback by that
fearful and cruel mountain of Nombray as a Venetian chronicler
described the Stelvio Pass She finally reached Innsbruck where she was
joined some months later by her tardy and coldhearted bridegroom
We had seen Biancas handsome bronze effigy in the Franciscan church at
Innsbruck and so felt a personal interest in the fair young bride who
had been launched forth upon this matrimonial venture with so much pomp
and ceremony her head crowned with diamonds and pearls and her long
train and huge sleeves supported by great nobles of Milan Foolish and
lightheaded the young Queen doubtless was and with some childish
habits which must have been annoying to her grave consort many years
her seniorErasmo Brasca the Milanese envoy says that he was obliged
to remonstrate with her for the silly trick of eating her meals on the
floor instead of at tableand yet she was a warmhearted affectionate
girl and like many another princess of that time she deserved a
happier fate than the loveless marriage that had been arranged for her
Our memories are quite fresh about Bianca and her sorrows because an
accommodating tourist who had Mrs Adys Beatrice dEste with her
has loaned it to us for reading in the eveningsat least for as much
time as we can afford to spend indoors when the outdoor world is so
beguiling
August 12th
The man of the party and the children set forth early this morning for
a days fishing on the lake Walter having learned from a loquacious
boatman that trout of large size frequently weighing fifteen pounds
are to be caught here We women lacking the credulity of the true
brother of the angle declined Walters invitation preferring a morning
at the Villa Carlotta to the calm quiet innocent recreation of
angling although we did encourage the fisherfolk by telling them that
we should return from sightseeing with keen appetites for their trout
The villa or chateau which we visited today situated on a hillside
directly opposite Bellagio is not that in which Maximilian and Carlotta
passed some happy years before the misfortunes of their life overtook
them That villa as you may remember is on the southern shore of Lake
Como at Cernobbio The fact of there being two Villas Carlotta on the
same lake is somewhat confusing as will appear later This one whose
beautiful hillside gardens reach from Cadenabbia to Tremezzo our
informing little local guidebook tells us was long known as the Villa
Clerici later as the Villa Sommariva and finally failing of heirs in
the Sommariva line it was bought by the Princess Albert of Prussia who
named the villa after her own daughter Charlotte
We crossed from Bellagio to Cadenabbia in one of the little boats with
brown awnings and gay cushions that add so much to the picturesqueness
of this fairy lake and made our way to the Villa Carlotta passing
through the richly wrought iron gates and up many steps to the terraced
garden where a fountain throws its feathery spray into the air We were
all three in such high spirits as befit a party of pleasure seekers
journeying through a land of enchantment on a brilliantly beautiful day
for it must be admitted that in a downpour of rain Lake Como and its
shores are like any other places in the rain Miss Cassandra who is gay
even under dull skies and overhanging clouds is gayer than usual
today having donned a hat in which she takes great pride a hat of her
own confection which she is pleased to call a Merry Widow and an
indecorously merry widow it is so riotous is it in its garnishings of
chiffon tulle and feathers Thus far Lydia has prevented her aunt from
appearing in public in her cherished hat but here in the lake
region where the sun is scorching at midday she rebels against Lydias
authority says she has no idea of having her brains broiled out for the
sake of keeping up a dignified and conventional appearance and that
this hat is just the thing for waterparties and is not at all extreme
compared with the peachbasket the immense picture hat with its
gigantic willow plumes the grenadier and other fashionable
monstrosities in the way of headgear Our jaunt to Cadenabbia appeared
to be the psychological moment for the inauguration of the merry widow
and so I may say truly and literally that our Quaker lady is in fine
feather today her head crowned with nodding plumes and not a qualm of
conscience anent the faraway meeting and its overseers to cloud her
pleasure
Whether in consequence of the charms of the merry widow or because of a
certain distinctive individuality that belongs to her Miss Cassandra
attracted even more attention than usual this morning While we were
admiring the noble Thorwaldsen reliefs that form the frieze of the
entrance hall and the exquisite marble of Cupid and Psyche by Canova
that is one of the glories of the Villa Carlotta she as is her
sociable wont fell into conversation with two Englishspeaking women of
distinguished appearance Before we left the chateau Miss Cassandra and
one of her new friends a stately beautiful woman were exchanging
confidences and experiences with the freedom and intimacy of two
schoolgirls These ladies whom Miss Cassandra is pleased to call the
American countessesit having transpired in the course of conversation
that they were of American birth Pennsylvanians in fact who had
married titled Italianswere courteous to us all but they simply
fell in love with our Quaker lady whose thees and thous seemed to
possess a magic charm for them
Later on we were in some way separated from our new acquaintances amid
the intricacies of these winding hillside paths where one may walk
miles especially if the guide is clever and entertaining and has an
eye to future lira bestowed in some proportion to the time spent in
exploring the beauties of the garden and to the fatigue attending the
tour Italian dames of high degree even if so fortunate as to have been
born in America are not usually as good walkers as our untitled
countrywomen These ladies being no exception to the rule had probably
yielded to the seductions of one of the rustic seats placed so
alluringly under the shade of fine trees while we wandered on from path
to path stopping to admire an avenue of palms a bamboo plantation a
blue Norway spruce a huge Indiarubber tree a bed of homelike American
ferns or a clump of gorgeous rhododendrons for the trees and flowers
of all climes thrive in this favored spot A party of four or five men
and women had joined us who talked to each other in German
occasionally bowing to us and smiling after the polite fashion of
foreigners when the guide drew our attention to some rare flower or
plant or to a charming vista of lake and mountain seen through a frame
of interlacing branches and vines An immense bed of cactus on a sunny
slope attracted the regard and admiration of our companions Miss
Cassandra who had seen the cactus in its glory on its native heath
recognized the strangers admiration even in an unknown language and by
way of protest expatiated in her enthusiastic fashion upon the splendor
of the cactus of Mexico the plumes of her hat waving in unison with her
eloquent words and gestures while Lydia and I exchanged amused glances
but our merriment was destined to be but short lived The strangers who
were standing near us could not of course get the drift of what Miss
Cassandra was saying but one of the party a man of strongly marked
personality evidently caught the word Mexico and pricked up his ears
when she repeated it In an instant a heavy hand was laid upon her
shoulder while an angry voice hissed close to her ear
Mexican Mexican Pourquoi avezvous tue lEmpereur Maximilian
Not comprehending this sudden arraignment although she felt the heavy
hand upon her shoulder heard the angry voice at her side and saw the
unfriendly faces that surrounded her our dear Miss Cassandra by way of
making matters worse repeated the only word that she had caught
Mexican Yes the Mexican cactus is much finer than this
This innocent remark seemed to irritate the Austrian beyond all bounds
He repeated his question in French still keeping his hand on the poor
ladys shoulder and gazing into her frightened face
Why did you kill the Emperor Maximilian gesticulating with his free
hand and drawing it across his throat Pourquoi lui avezvous coupe la
gorge
Lydia and I were too shocked and dismayed to speak and in that instant
of terror every sad and gruesome disaster that had befallen unprotected
travellers in a strange land passed in rapid review before our minds
We turned to the guide for help but he who had been so voluble and
instructive in botanical lore in several languages now held his tongue
in them all appearing quite dull and uninterested as if having no
understanding or part in the affair Suddenly my voice came to me and I
cried out in the best French that I could command The Emperor
Maximilian did not have his throat cut He died like a soldier He was
shot
Well then exclaimed the Austrian still gesticulating violently with
one hand and shaking Miss Cassandras shoulder with the other Why did
you shoot him
Not having improved the situation by my remark I turned again to the
guide when to our immense relief the American countesses most
opportunely emerged from a shaded path Miss Cassandras pale
frightened face the despair written upon Lydias and mine the
strangers excited tone and gestures told half the story while I
eagerly explained
These people are Austrians They think that Miss Cassandra is a
Mexican and they hate her on account of the assassination of the
Emperor Maximilian She is frightened to death but she does not
understand a word of what it is all about Do explain
The stately lady Countess Z by name drew near threw her arm
protectingly around Miss Cassandra and turning to the Austrian with
an air of command ordered him to take his hand off her shoulder
explaining in German German had never sounded so sweet to my ears that
this lady was an American citizen who had simply travelled in Mexico
The man listened and withdrew his hand looking decidedly crestfallen
when she added The American nation had nothing to do with the most
unfortunate sacrifice of your young prince in fact the government at
Washington made an effort to avert the disaster His death was deplored
in America and you must remember that the whole affair was in a large
measure instigated by the ambitious designs of Napoleon III who broke
faith with Maximilian failed to send him the troops he had promised
him and cruelly abandoned him to his fate
The Austrian bowed low and humbly apologized adding something in an
undertone about Here in the grounds of the chateau where Maximilian and
Carlotta had once lived seemed no place to talk about Mexico
You are quite mistaken exclaimed the Countess This is not the Villa
Carlotta that once belonged to Maximilian That is quite at the other
end of the lake This chateau long the property of the Sommariva
family passed in 1843 into the hands of the Princess Charlotte of
Prussia who named it after her daughter another Carlotta and I hope a
happier one than the poor Empress Carlotta
Again the Austrian bowed and apologized this time to Miss Cassandra
who from his softened voice and deferential manner realized that
whatever deadly peril had menaced her was happily averted and throwing
her arms around the Countess Zs neck she exclaimed My dear
countrywoman Thee has the face of an angel and like an angel thee has
brought peace to our troubled minds But for the life of me I cannot
tell what I have done to make that German so angry
When Miss Cassandra had learned what was the head and front of her
offending she begged the Countess to explain that she was a woman of
peace that war was abhorrent to her and all of her persuasion and
finally she quite won the Austrians heart by telling him that she had
no admiration for that upstart Bonaparte family Miss Cassandra is
nothing if not aristocratic that for her part she liked
oldestablished dynasties like the Hapsburgs and had always
considered the marriage of the daughter of a long line of kings with the
selfmade Emperor a great come down for Maria Louisa Please remember
that these are Miss Cassandras sentiments not mine and how the dear
ItalianAmerican lady managed to translate them into good German and
keep her face straight at the same time I know not but the Austrian
evidently understood as he became more profusely apologetic every
moment and well he might be for as Miss Cassandra says No amount of
bowing and scraping and apologizing could make up for the fright he had
given us But she is the most forgiving of mortals as you know and an
entente cordiale having been established through the mediation of our
two AmericanItalian diplomatistes the two recent foes were soon
exchanging courtesies and scaling mountain paths together hand in hand
smiling gesticulating quite en rapport without a syllable of
language between them Miss Cassandras nodding plumes seeming to
accentuate her expressions of peace and good will While our Quaker lady
was stepping off gaily her late tormentor now her willing captive
Lydia usually so quiet and selfcontained suddenly collapsed upon the
nearest seat and went off in a violent attack of hysterics One of the
Austrian women rushed off for a glass of water while the countesses
ministered to her in true storybook fashion having with them a bottle
of sal volatile which seems to be an important part of the equipment of
every wellappointed foreign lady And what do you think that heartless
Lydia said between her laughter and her sobs If only one of us had had
a kodak with us to take a snapshot of Aunt Cassie with the angry
Austrian berating her Nobody will ever believe the story when we get
back to America and then it would lose half its point without the merry
widow
Of course we had tales of adventure to relate when reunited with our
family this evening Walter warmly and I believe with sincerity
expressed his regret that he had not been with us which regret was
probably all the more heartfelt because he had failed to catch the
fifteen pound trout or indeed I may add in all truthfulness trout of
any size and weight
II
AN ISLAND CHATEAU
PENSION BEAUSEJOUR STRESA Wednesday August 17th
WE REACHED this enchanting spot by a most circuitous and varied route
which I outline for you as you may be coming this way some time From
Bellagio we crossed over to Menaggio on Monday after dejeuner where
we took an electric tram which brought us to Porlezza in less than an
hour Here we found a boat awaiting us in which we enjoyed a two hours
sail on beautiful Lake Lugano At Lugano which we reached before six o
clock we were in Switzerland as we learned when the customs officers
visited our luggage with no benefit to themselves and little
disturbance to us and again when we found our beds at the hotel
supplied with feather counterpanesand I may venture to say it with all
my love for Italyby a scrupulous and shining cleanliness that belongs
more to the thrifty Swiss than to the amiable and less energetic
Italians Lugano is full of quaint corners interesting narrow streets
market wagons drawn by oxen and stalls and carts on all sides filled
with curios and native wares that would tempt the most blase shopper
Yesterday being a market day when the peasants come in from the
surrounding country in their ox carts and with their great panniers or
hottes on their backs we found many delightful bits for our kodaks
The children were especially interested in a woman who carried a pretty
little young kid in her pannier instead of the fruits and vegetables
that are usually to be seen in these great baskets and a heavy load it
must have been But these Swiss and Italian women are burdenbearers
from early childhood
We needed a week instead of a day and night at Lugano and let me advise
you and Allan not to travel on schedule time when you make your tour
through these lakes as there are so many delightful side trips to be
made Some pleasant Americans whom we met at the hotel in Lugano told
us that a day or two spent on the summit of Monte Generoso is well worth
while as the view is one of the finest in Europe embracing as it does
the chain of the Alps the Italian lakes and the vast plains of
Lombardy as far as the Apennines In addition to all this there are fine
woods and pasture lands upon this mountain top and a hotel in which one
may sojourn in comfort if comfort is to be considered when such
heavenly views are to be feasted upon
We quitted Lugano after luncheon yesterday having had time for only a
hurried visit to the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli and the famous
Luini frescoes Another charming trip on the lovely Lago di Lugano
brought us to Ponte Tresa from whence we journeyed by a steam tram
through an enchanting wild wood country full of little hills and
rushing streamlets to Luino Do you wonder that Lisa calls this a fairy
journey The change from car to boat and boat to car takes away all the
weariness of travel and the varied beauties of lake and shore make this
an ideal trip especially as we found ourselves transferred to another
boat at Luino which brought us straight to fairyland here at Stresa
The lights upon the many boats on the lake and in the hotels and villas
along the shore gave the little town a gala appearance as if it were
celebrating our arrival as Miss Cassandra suggested Later on it
became humiliatingly evident that we had not been expected our boat was
late the cabs had all gone away and it was with difficulty that we
secured enough conveyances for our party
We drove many miles so it seemed to us by winding roads up a steep
hillside to this pension where we finally found light warmth welcome
and good beds of which last we were sorely in need By morning light
the pension proves itself to be well named BeauSejour as it is
delightfully situated on a hill above the lake with a garden which
slopes down to the town full of oleanders and orange and lemon trees
When I opened the jalousies at my window what should I see but dear
snowcrested Monte Rosa and the rest of the Alpine chain seeming quite
near in this crystal atmosphere a perfect background for the
picturesque Borromean Islands fairy islets in a silver lake
I really think that Maggiore is more beautiful than Como I said
reluctantly for I have heretofore contended that Lake Como at Bellagio
is the most beautiful place on the face of the earth
Take what goods the gods provide you Zelphine and dont use up the
gray matter of your brain trying to find out which of these lakes you
like best said Walter in his most judicial tone
Yes but one really cannot help comparing these two lakes and if we
