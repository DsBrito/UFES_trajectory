English literature bears in all its phases the imprint of a double
origin French literature on the other hand is absolutely homogeneous
How far this is an advantage or the reverse it would be difficult to
say but the important fact for the English reader to notice is that
this great difference does exist between the French language and his
own The complex origin of the English tongue has enabled English
writers to obtain those effects of diversity of contrast of
imaginative strangeness which have played such a dominating part in our
literature The genius of the French language descended from its single
Latin stock has triumphed most in the contrary directionin
simplicity in unity in clarity and in restraint
Some of these qualities are already distinctly visible in the earliest
French works which have come down to usthe Chansons de Geste These
poems consist of several groups or cycles of narrative verse cast in
the epic mould It is probable that they first came into existence in
the eleventh and twelfth centuries and they continued to be produced in
various forms of repetition rearrangement and at last degradation
throughout the Middle Ages Originally they were not written but
recited Their authors were the wandering minstrels who found in the
crowds collected together at the great fairs and places of pilgrimage of
those early days an audience for long narratives of romance and
adventure drawn from the Latin chronicles and the monkish traditions of
a still more remote past The earliest the most famous and the finest
of these poems is the Chanson de Roland which recounts the mythical
incidents of a battle between Charlemagne with all his peerage and
the hosts of the Saracens Apart from some touches of the
marvelloussuch as the two hundred years of Charlemagne and the
intervention of angelsthe whole atmosphere of the work is that of
eleventhcentury France with its aristocratic society its barbaric
vigour its brutality and its high sentiments of piety and honour The
beauty of the poem lies in the grand simplicity of its style Without a
trace of the delicacy and variety of a Homer farther still from the
consummate literary power of a Virgil or a Dante the unknown minstrel
who composed the Chanson de Roland possessed nevertheless a very real
gift of art He worked on a large scale with a bold confidence
Discarding absolutely the aids of ornament and the rhetorical
elaboration of words he has succeeded in evoking with an extraordinary
naked vividness the scenes of strife and heroism which he describes At
his bestin the lines of farewell between Roland and Oliver and the
wellknown account of Rolands deathhe rises to a restrained and
severe pathos which is truly sublime This great workbleak bare
gaunt majesticstands out to the readers of today like some huge
mass of ancient granite on the far horizon of the literature of France
While the Chansons de Geste were developing in numerous cycles of
varying merit another group of narrative poems created under different
influences came into being These were the Romans Bretons a series
of romances in verse inspired by the Celtic myths and traditions which
still lingered in Brittany and England The spirit of these poems was
very different from that of the Chansons de Geste The latter were the
typical offspring of the French geniuspositive definite
materialistic the former were impregnated with all the dreaminess the
mystery and the romantic spirituality of the Celt The legends upon
which they were based revolved for the most part round the history of
King Arthur and his knights they told of the strange adventures of
Lancelot of the marvellous quest of the Holy Grail of the overwhelming
and fatal loves of Tristan and Yseult The stories gained an immense
popularity in France but they did not long retain their original
character In the crucible of the facile and successful CHRETIEN DE
TROYES who wrote towards the close of the twelfth century they assumed
a new complexion their mystical strangeness became transmuted into the
more commonplace magic of wizards and conjurers while their elevated
immaterial conception of love was replaced by the superfine affectations
of a mundane gallantry Nothing shows more clearly at what an early
date and with what strength the most characteristic qualities of
French literature were developed than the way in which the vague
imaginations of the Celtic romances were metamorphosed by French writers
into the unambiguous elegances of civilized life
Both the Chansons de Geste and the Romans Bretons were aristocratic
literature they were concerned with the life and idealsthe martial
prowess the chivalric devotion the soaring honourof the great nobles
of the age But now another form of literature arose which depicted in
short verse narratives the more ordinary conditions of middleclass
life These Fabliaux as they were called are on the whole of no
great value as works of art their poetical form is usually poor and
their substance exceedingly gross Their chief interest lies in the fact
that they reveal no less clearly than the aristocratic Chansons some
of the most abiding qualities of the French genius Its innate love of
absolute realism and its peculiar capacity for cutting satirethese
characteristics appear in the Fabliaux in all their completeness In
one or two of the stories when the writer possesses a true vein of
sensibility and taste we find a surprising vigour of perception and a
remarkable psychological power Resembling the Fabliaux in their
realism and their bourgeois outlook but far more delicate and witty
the group of poems known as the Roman de Renard takes a high place in
the literature of the age The humanity the dramatic skill and the
command of narrative power displayed in some of these pleasant satires
where the foibles and the cunning of men and women are thinly veiled
under the disguise of animal life give a foretaste of the charming art
which was to blossom forth so wonderfully four centuries later in the
Fables of La Fontaine
One other work has come down to us from this early epoch which presents
a complete contrast both with the rough bold spirit of the Chansons
de Geste and the literal realism of the Fabliaux This is the
chantefable or mingled narrative in verse and prose of Aucassin et
Nicolete Here all is delicacy and exquisitenessthe beauty at once
fragile and imperishable of an enchanting work of art The unknown
author has created in his light clear verse and his still more
graceful and poetical prose a delicious atmosphere of delicate romance
It is the tender eyedawn of aurorean love that he shows usthe
happy sweet almost childish passion of two young creatures who move
in absolute innocence and beauty through a wondrous world of their own
The youth Aucassin who rides into the fight dreaming of his beloved
who sees her shining among the stars in heaven
Estoilette je te voi
Que la lune trait a soi
Nicolete est avec toi
Mamiete o le blond poil
Little star I see thee there
That the moon draws close to her
Nicolette is with thee there
My love of the yellow hair
who disdains the joys of Paradise since they exclude the joys of
loving
En paradis quaije a faire Je ni quier entrer mais que jaie
Nicolete ma tres douce amie que jaime tant Mais en enfer voil
jou aler Car en enfer vont li bel clerc et li bel cevalier qui
sont mort as tournois et as rices guerres et li bien sergant et
li franc homme Avec ciax voil jou aler mais que jaie
Nicolete ma tres douce amie avec moi What have I to do in
Paradise I seek not to enter there so that I have Nicolette my
most sweet friend whom I love so well But to Hell will I go
For to Hell go the fine clerks and the fine knights who have died
in tourneys and in rich wars and the brave soldiers and the
freeborn men With these will I go so that I have Nicolette
my most sweet friend with me
Aucassin at once brave and naif sensuous and spiritual is as much
the type of the perfect medieval lover as Romeo with his ardour and his
vitality is of the Renaissance one But the poemfor in spite of the
prose passages the little work is in effect simply a poemis not all
sentiment and dreams With admirable art the author has interspersed
here and there contrasting episodes of realism or of absurdity he has
woven into his story a succession of vivid dialogues and by means of an
acute sense of observation he has succeeded in keeping his airy fantasy
in touch with actual things The description of Nicolette escaping from
her prison and stepping out over the grass in her naked feet with the
daisies as she treads on them showing black against her whiteness is
a wonderful example of his power of combining imagination with detail
beauty with truth Together with the Chanson de Rolandthough in such
an infinitely different styleAucassin et Nicolete represents the
most valuable elements in the French poetry of this early age
With the thirteenth century a new development began and one of the
highest importancethe development of Prose La Conquete de
Constantinople by VILLEHARDOUIN written at the beginning of the
century is the earliest example of those historical memoirs which were
afterwards to become so abundant in French literature and it is
written not in the poetical prose of Aucassin et Nicolete but in the
simple plain style of straightforward narrative The book cannot be
ranked among the masterpieces but it has the charm of sincerity and
that kind of pleasant flavour which belong to innocent antiquity The
good old Villehardouin has something of the engaging naivete
something of the romantic curiosity of Herodotus And in spite of the
sobriety and dryness of his writing he can at moments bring a sense of
colour and movement into his words His description of the great fleet
of the crusaders starting from Corfu has this fine sentence Et le
jour fut clair et beau et le vent doux et bon Et ils laisserent aller
les voiles au vent His account of the spectacle of Constantinople
when it appeared for the first time to the astonished eyes of the
Christian nobles is well known Ils ne pouvaient croire que si riche
ville put etre au monde quand ils virent ces hauts murs et ces riches
tours dont elle etait close tout autour a la ronde et ces riches palais
et ces hautes eglises Et sachez quil ny eut si hardi a qui la
chair ne fremit et ce ne fut une merveille car jamais si grande
affaire ne fut entreprise de nulles gens depuis que le monde fut cree
Who does not feel at such words as these across the ages the thrill of
the old adventure
A higher level of interest and significance is reached by JOINVILLE in
his Vie de Saint Louis written towards the close of the century The
fascination of the book lies in its human qualities Joinville narrates
in the easy flowing tone of familiar conversation his reminiscences of
the good king in whose service he had spent the active years of his
life and whose memory he held in adoration The deeds the words the
noble sentiments the saintly devotion of Louisthese things he relates
with a charming and ingenuous sympathy yet with a perfect freedom and
an absolute veracity Nor is it only the character of his master that
Joinville has brought into his pages his book is as much a
selfrevelation as a biography Unlike Villehardouin whose chronicle
shows hardly a trace of personal feeling Joinville speaks of himself
unceasingly and has impressed his work indelibly with the mark of his
own individuality Much of its charm depends upon the contrast which he
thus almost unconsciously reveals between himself and his masterthe
vivacious commonsense eminently human nobleman and the grave
elevated idealizing king In their conversations recounted with such
detail and such relish by Joinville the whole force of this contrast
becomes delightfully apparent One seems to see in them compressed and
symbolized in the characters of these two friends the conflicting
qualities of sense and spirit of worldliness and selfimmolation of
the most shrewd and literal perspicacity and the most visionary
exaltation which make up the singular antithesis of the Middle Ages
A contrast no less complete though of a different nature is to be
found in the most important poetical work of the thirteenth centuryLe
Roman de la Rose The first part of this curious poem was composed by
GUILLAUME DE LORRIS a young scholar who wrote for that aristocratic
public which in the previous generation had been fascinated by the
courtly romances of Chretien de Troyes Inspired partly by that writer
and partly by Ovid it was the aim of Lorris to produce an Art of
Love brought up to date and adapted to the tastes of his aristocratic
audience with all the elaborate paraphernalia of learned disquisition
and formal gallantry which was then the mode The poem cast in the form
of an intricate allegory is of significance chiefly on account of its
immense popularity and for its being the fountainhead of a school of
allegorical poetry which flourished for many centuries in France Lorris
died before he had finished his work which however was destined to be
completed in a singular manner Forty years later another young
scholar JEAN DE MEUNG added to the 4000 lines which Lorris had left no
fewer than 18000 of his own This vast addition was not only quite out
of proportion but also quite out of tone with the original work Jean de
Meung abandoned entirely the refined and aristocratic atmosphere of his
predecessor and wrote with all the realism and coarseness of the middle
class of that day Lorriss vapid allegory faded into insignificance
becoming a mere peg for a huge mass of extraordinarily varied discourse
The whole of the scholastic learning of the Middle Ages is poured in a
confused stream through this remarkable and deeply interesting work Nor
is it merely as a repository of medieval erudition that Jean de Meungs
poem deserves attention for it is easy to perceive in it an
intellectual tendency far in advance of its agea spirit which however
trammelled by antiquated conventions yet claims kinship with that of
Rabelais or even that of Voltaire Jean de Meung was not a great
artist he wrote without distinction and without sense of form it is
his bold and voluminous thought that gives him a high place in French
literature In virtue alike of his popularization of an encyclopedic
store of knowledge and of his underlying doctrinethe worship of
Naturehe ranks as a true forerunner of the great movement of the
Renaissance
The intellectual stirring which seemed to be foreshadowed by the
second part of the Roman de la Rose came to nothing The disasters
and confusion of the Hundred Years War left France with very little
energy either for art or speculation the horrors of a civil war
followed and thus the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are perhaps
the emptiest in the annals of her literature In the fourteenth century
one great writer embodied the character of the time FROISSART has
filled his splendid pages with the pomp and circumstance of glorious
war Though he spent many years and a large part of his fortune in the
collection of materials for his history of the wars between France and
England it is not as an historian that he is now remembered it is as a
writer of magnificent prose His Chroniques devoid of any profundity
of insight any true grasp of the movements of the age have rarely been
paralleled in the brilliance and animation of their descriptions the
vigour of their characterdrawing the flowing picturesqueness of their
style They unroll themselves like some long tapestry gorgeously
inwoven with scenes of adventure and chivalry with flags and spears and
chargers and the faces of highborn ladies and the mailclad figures of
knights Admirable in all his descriptions it is in his battlepieces
that Froissart particularly excels Then the glow of his hurrying
sentences redoubles and the excitement and the bravery of the combat
rush out from his pen in a swift and sparkling stream One sees the
serried ranks and the flashing armour one hears the clash of weapons
and the shouting of the captains Montjoie Saint Denis Saint George
Gianeone feels the sway and the press and the tumult one laments
with the vanquished one exults with the victors and amid the
glittering panoply of grand seigneur conte baron chevalier et
escuier with their highsounding titles and their gallant prowess one
forgets the reverse side of all this glorythe ravaged fields the
smoking villages the ruined peasantsthe long desolation of France
The Chronicles of Froissart are history seen through the eyes of a
herald the Memoirs of PHILIPPE DE COMMYNES are history envisaged by a
politician and a diplomatist When Commynes wrotetowards the close of
the fifteenth centurythe confusion and strife which Froissart had
chronicled with such a gusto were things of the past and France was
beginning to emerge as a consolidated and centralized state Commynes
himself one of the confidential ministers of Louis XI had played an
important part in this development and his book is the record of the
triumphant policy of his crafty and sagacious sovereign It is a fine
piece of history written with lucidity and firmness by a man who had
spent all his life behind the scenes and who had never been taken in
The penetration and the subtlety of Commynes make his work interesting
chiefly for its psychological studies and for the light that it throws
on those principles of cunning statecraft which permeated the politics
and diplomacy of the age and were to receive their final exposition in
the Prince of Machiavelli In his calm judicious unaffected pages we
can trace the first beginnings of that strange movement which was to
convert the old Europe of the Middle Ages with its universal Empire and
its universal Church into the new Europe of independent secular
nationsthe Europe of today
Commynes thus stands on the brink of the modern world though his style
is that of his own time his matter belongs to the future he looks
forward into the Renaissance At the opposite end of the social scale
from this rich and powerful diplomatist VILLON gave utterance in
language of poignant beauty to the deepest sentiments of the age that
was passing away A ruffian a robber a murderer haunting the vile
places of Paris flying from justice condemned imprisoned almost
executed and vanishing at last none knows how or where this
extraordinary genius lives now as a poet and a dreameran artist who
could clothe in unforgettable verse the intensest feelings of a soul
The bulk of his work is not large In his Grand Testamenta poem of
about 1500 lines containing a number of interspersed ballades and
rondeausin his Petit Testament and in a small number of
miscellaneous poems he has said all that he has to say The most
selfcommunicative of poets he has impressed his own personality on
every line that he wrote Into the stiff and complicated forms of the
rondeau and rondel the ballade and double ballade with their limited
rhymes and their enforced repetitions he has succeeded in breathing not
only the spirit of beauty but the spirit of individuality He was not a
simple character his melancholy was shot with irony and laughter
sensuality and sentimentality both mingled with his finest imaginations
and his profoundest visions and all these qualities are reflected
shifting and iridescent in the magic web of his verse One thought
however perpetually haunts him under all his music of laughter or of
passion it is easy to hear one dominating note It is the thought of
mortality The whining leering brooding creature can never for a
moment forget that awful Shadow He sees it in all its aspectsas a
subject for mockery for penitence for resignation for despair He
sees it as the melancholy inevitable end of all that is beautiful all
that is lovely on earth
Dictes moi ou nen quel pays
Est Flora la belle Rommaine
Archipiada ne Thais
and so through the rest of the splendid catalogue with its sad
unanswerable refrain
Mais ou sont les neiges dantan
Even more persistently the vision rises before him of the physical
terrors of deaththe hideousness of its approaches the loathsomeness
of its corruptions in vain he smiles in vain he weeps the grim
imagination will not leave him In the midst of his wildest debauches
he suddenly remembers the horrible features of decaying age he repents
but there close before him he sees the fatal gibbet and his own body
swinging among the crows
With Villon the medieval literature of France comes at once to a climax
and a termination His potent and melancholy voice vibrates with the
accumulated passion and striving and pain of those faroff generations
and sinks mysteriously into silence with the birth of a new and happier
world
CHAPTER II
THE RENAISSANCE
There is something dark and wintry about the atmosphere of the later
Middle Ages The poems of Villon produce the impression of some bleak
desolate landscape of snowcovered roofs and frozen streets shut in by
mists and with a menacing shiver in the air It is
sur la morte saison
Que les loups se vivent de vent
Et quon se tient en sa maison
Pour le frimas pres du tison
Then all at once the grey gloom lifts and we are among the colours the
sunshine and the bursting vitality of spring
The great intellectual and spiritual change which came over western
Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century was the result of a
number of converging causes of which the most important were the
diffusion of classical literature consequent upon the breakup of the
Byzantine Empire at the hands of the Turks the brilliant civilization
of the Italian citystates and the establishment in France Spain and
England of powerful monarchies whose existence ensured the maintenance
of order and internal peace Thus it happened that the splendid
literature of the Ancient Worldso rich in beauty and so significant in
thoughtcame into hands worthy of receiving it Scholars artists and
thinkers seized upon the wondrous heritage and found in it a whole
unimagined universe of instruction and delight At the same time the
physical discoveries of explorers and men of science opened out vast
fresh regions of speculation and adventure Men saw with astonishment
the old world of their fathers vanishing away and within them and
without them the dawning of a new heaven and a new earth The effect on
literature of these combined forces was enormous In France
particularly under the strong and brilliant government of Francis I
there was an outburst of original and vital writing This literature
which begins in effect what may be called the distinctively modern
literature of France differs in two striking respects from that of the
Middle Ages Both in their attitude towards art and in their attitude
towards thought the great writers of the Renaissance inaugurated a new
era in French literature
The new artistic views of the age first appeared as was natural in the
domain of poetry The change was one towards consciousness and
deliberate selfcritical effort The medieval poets had sung with
beauty but that was not enough for the poets of the Renaissance they
determined to sing not only with beauty but with care The movement
began in the verse of MAROT whose clear civilized worldly poetry
shows for the first time that tendency to select and to refine that
love of ease and sincerity and that endeavour to say nothing that is
not said well which were to become the fundamental characteristics of
all that was best in French poetry for the next three hundred years In
such an exquisite little work of art as his epistle in threesyllabled
verseA une Damoyselle Malade beginning
Ma mignonne
Je vous donne
Le bonjour
we already have in all its completeness that tone of mingled
distinction gaiety and grace which is one of the unique products of the
mature poetical genius of France But Marots gift was not wide enough
for the voluminous energies of the age and it was not until a
generation later in the work of the Pleiadea group of writers of
whom RONSARD was the chief and who flourished about the middle of the
sixteenth centurythat the poetical spirit of the French Renaissance
found its full expression
The mere fact that the Pleiade formed a definite school with common
principles and a fixed poetical creed differentiates them in a striking
way from the poets who had preceded them They worked with no casual
purpose no merely professional art but with a high sense of the glory
of their calling and a noble determination to give to the Muses whom
they worshipped only of their best They boldly assertedin Du Bellays
admirable essay La Defense et Illustration de la Langue
Francaisethe right of the French language to stand beside those of
the ancients as a means of poetical expression and they devoted their
lives to the proof of their doctrine But their respect for their own
tongue by no means implied a neglect of the Classics On the contrary
they shared to the full the adoration of their contemporaries for the
learning and the literature of the Ancient World They were scholars as
well as poets and their great object was to create a tradition in the
poetry of France which should bring it into accord with the immortal
models of Greece and Rome This desire to imitate classical literature
led to two results In the first place it led to the invention of a
great number of new poetical forms and the abandonment of the old
narrow and complicated conventions which had dominated the poetry of
the Middle Ages With the free and ample forms of the Classics before
them Ronsard and his school enfranchised French verse Their technical
ability was very great and it is hardly too much to say that the result
of their efforts was the creation of something hitherto lacking in
French literaturea poetical instrument which in its strength its
freedom its variety of metrical resources and its artistic finish was
really adequate to fulfil the highest demands of genius In this
direction their most important single achievement was their elevation of
the Alexandrine versethe great twelvesyllabled rhyming coupletto
that place of undisputed superiority over all other metres which it has
ever since held in French poetry
But the Pleiades respect for classical models led to another and a
far less fortunate result They allowed their erudition to impinge upon
their poetry and in their eagerness to echo the voice of antiquity
they too often failed to realize the true bent either of their own
language or their own powers This is especially obvious in the longer
poems of Ronsardhis Odes and his Franciadewhere all the effort
and skill of the poet have not been enough to save his verse from tedium
and inflation The Classics swam into the ken of these early discoverers
in such a blaze of glory that their eyes were dazzled and their feet
misled It was owing to their very eagerness to imitate their great
models exactlyto ape the outward form of majestythat they failed
to realize the true inward spirit of Classical Art
It is in their shorter poemswhen the stress of classical imitation is
forgotten in the ebullition of individual geniusthat Ronsard and his
followers really come to their own These beautiful lyrics possess the
freshness and charm of some clear April morning with its delicate
flowers and its carolling birds It is the voice of youth that sings in
light and varied measures composed with such an exquisite happiness
such an unlaboured art The songs are of Love and of Nature of roses
skylarks and kisses of blue skies and natural joys Sometimes there is
a sadder note and the tender music reminds us of the ending of
pleasures and the hurrying steps of Time But with what a different
accent from that of the dark and relentless Villon These gentle singers
had no words for such brutalities
Quand vous serez bien vieille au soir a la chandelle
so Ronsard addresses his mistress and the image is a charming one of
quiet and refined old age with its halfsmiling memories of vanished
loves What had become in the hands of Villon a subject for grim jests
and horrible descriptions gave to Ronsard simply an opportunity for the
delicate pathos of regret Then again the note changes and the pure
tense passion of Louise Labe
Oh si jetais en ce beau sein ravie
De celuila pour lequel vais mourant
falls upon our ears And then in the great sonnet sequence of Du
BellayLes Antiquites de Romewe hear a splendid sound unknown
before in French poetrythe sonorous boom of proud and pompous verse
Contemporary with the poetry of the Pleiade the influence of the
Renaissance spirit upon French literature appeared with even more
striking force in the prose of RABELAIS The great achievement of the
Pleiade had been the establishment once and for all of the doctrine
that literature was something essentially artistic it was Rabelais who
showed that it possessed another qualitythat it was a mighty
instrument of thought The intellectual effort of the Middle Ages had
very rarely clothed itself in an artistic literary form Men laughed or
wept in the poetry or prose of their own tongue but they thought in
scholastic Latin The work of Jean de Meung was an exception but even
there the poetical form was rough and feeble the artistic and the
intellectual principles had not coalesced The union was accomplished by
Rabelais Far outstripping Jean de Meung in the comprehensiveness and
vigour of his thought he at the same time infinitely surpassed him as
an artist At first sight indeed his great book hardly conveys such an
impression to a careless reader it might appear to be simply the work
of a buffoon or a madman But such a conception of it would be totally
mistaken The more closely one examines it the more forcibly one must
be struck alike by its immense powers of intellect and its consummate
literary ability The whole vast spirit of the Renaissance is gathered
within its pages the tremendous vitality the enormous erudition the
dazzling optimism the courage the inventiveness the humanity of that
extraordinary age And these qualities are conveyed to us not by some
mere conscientious pedant or some clumsy enthusiast but by a born
writera man whose whole being was fixed and concentrated in an
astonishing command of words It is in the multitude of his words that
the fertility of Rabelais spirit most obviously shows itself His book
is an orgy of words they pour out helterskelter wildly into swirling
sentences and huge catalogues that in serried columns overflow the
page Not quite wildly though for amid all the rush and bluster
there is a powerful underlying art The rhythms of this extraordinary
prose are long and complex but they exist and they are controlled with
the absolute skill of a master
The purpose of Rabelais book cannot be summed up in a sentence It may
be described as the presentment of a point of view but what point of
view There lies the crux of the question and numberless critics have
wrangled over the solution of it The truth is that the only complete
description of the point of view is to be foundin the book itself it
is too wide and variegated for any other habitation Yet if it would be
vain to attempt an accurate and exhaustive account of Rabelais
philosophy the main outlines of that philosophy are nevertheless
visible enough Alike in the gianthero Pantagruel in his father
Gargantua and in his follower and booncompanion Panurge one can
discern the spirit of the Renaissanceexpansive humorous powerful
and above all else alive Rabelais book is the incarnation of the
great reaction of his epoch against the superstitious gloom and the
narrow asceticism of the Middle Ages He proclaims in his rich
reechoing voice a new conception of the world he denies that it is
the vale of sorrows envisioned by the teachers of the past he declares
that it is abounding in glorious energy abounding in splendid hope
and by its very nature good With a generous hatred of stupidity he
flies full tilt at the pedantic education of the monasteries and
asserts the highest ideals of science and humanity With an equal
loathing of asceticism he satirizes the monks themselves and sketches
