The difference in rise and fall is also remarkablenot in the upper
but in the lower river The rise is tolerably uniform down to Natchez
three hundred and sixty miles above the mouthabout fifty feet
But at Bayou La Fourche the river rises only twentyfour feet at New
Orleans only fifteen and just above the mouth only two and one half
An article in the New Orleans TimesDemocrat based upon reports of
able engineers states that the river annually empties four hundred and
six million tons of mud into the Gulf of Mexicowhich brings to mind
Captain Marryats rude name for the Mississippithe Great Sewer This
mud solidified would make a mass a mile square and two hundred and
fortyone feet high
The mud deposit gradually extends the landbut only gradually it has
extended it not quite a third of a mile in the two hundred years which
have elapsed since the river took its place in history The belief of
the scientific people is that the mouth used to be at Baton Rouge
where the hills cease and that the two hundred miles of land between
there and the Gulf was built by the river This gives us the age of that
piece of country without any trouble at allone hundred and twenty
thousand years Yet it is much the youthfullest batch of country that
lies around there anywhere
The Mississippi is remarkable in still another wayits disposition to
make prodigious jumps by cutting through narrow necks of land and thus
straightening and shortening itself More than once it has shortened
itself thirty miles at a single jump These cutoffs have had curious
effects they have thrown several river towns out into the rural
districts and built up sand bars and forests in front of them The town
of Delta used to be three miles below Vicksburg a recent cutoff
has radically changed the position and Delta is now TWO MILES ABOVE
Vicksburg
Both of these river towns have been retired to the country by that
cutoff A cutoff plays havoc with boundary lines and jurisdictions
for instance a man is living in the State of Mississippi today a
cutoff occurs tonight and tomorrow the man finds himself and his
land over on the other side of the river within the boundaries and
subject to the laws of the State of Louisiana Such a thing happening
in the upper river in the old times could have transferred a slave from
Missouri to Illinois and made a free man of him
The Mississippi does not alter its locality by cutoffs alone it is
always changing its habitat BODILYis always moving bodily SIDEWISE
At Hard Times La the river is two miles west of the region it used to
occupy As a result the original SITE of that settlement is not now in
Louisiana at all but on the other side of the river in the State of
Mississippi NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THAT ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED MILES
OF OLD MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHICH LA SALLE FLOATED DOWN IN HIS CANOES TWO
HUNDRED YEARS AGO IS GOOD SOLID DRY GROUND NOW The river lies to the
right of it in places and to the left of it in other places
Although the Mississippis mud builds land but slowly down at the
mouth where the Gulfs billows interfere with its work it builds fast
enough in better protected regions higher up for instance Prophets
Island contained one thousand five hundred acres of land thirty years
ago since then the river has added seven hundred acres to it
But enough of these examples of the mighty streams eccentricities for
the presentI will give a few more of them further along in the book
Let us drop the Mississippis physical history and say a word about its
historical historyso to speak We can glance briefly at its slumbrous
first epoch in a couple of short chapters at its second and widerawake
epoch in a couple more at its flushest and widestawake epoch in a good
many succeeding chapters and then talk about its comparatively tranquil
present epoch in what shall be left of the book
The world and the books are so accustomed to use and overuse the word
new in connection with our country that we early get and permanently
retain the impression that there is nothing old about it We do of
course know that there are several comparatively old dates in American
history but the mere figures convey to our minds no just idea no
distinct realization of the stretch of time which they represent
To say that De Soto the first white man who ever saw the Mississippi
River saw it in 1542 is a remark which states a fact without
interpreting it it is something like giving the dimensions of a sunset
by astronomical measurements and cataloguing the colors by their
scientific namesas a result you get the bald fact of the sunset but
you dont see the sunset It would have been better to paint a picture
of it
The date 1542 standing by itself means little or nothing to us but
when one groups a few neighboring historical dates and facts around it
he adds perspective and color and then realizes that this is one of the
American dates which is quite respectable for age
For instance when the Mississippi was first seen by a white man less
than a quarter of a century had elapsed since Francis Is defeat at
Pavia the death of Raphael the death of Bayard SANS PEUR ET SANS
REPROCHE the driving out of the KnightsHospitallers from Rhodes by
the Turks and the placarding of the NinetyFive Propositionsthe act
which began the Reformation When De Soto took his glimpse of the river
Ignatius Loyola was an obscure name the order of the Jesuits was not
yet a year old Michael Angelos paint was not yet dry on the Last
Judgment in the Sistine Chapel Mary Queen of Scots was not yet born
but would be before the year closed Catherine de Medici was a child
Elizabeth of England was not yet in her teens Calvin Benvenuto
Cellini and the Emperor Charles V were at the top of their fame and
each was manufacturing history after his own peculiar fashion Margaret
of Navarre was writing the Heptameron and some religious booksthe
first survives the others are forgotten wit and indelicacy being
sometimes better literature preservers than holiness lax court morals
and the absurd chivalry business were in full feather and the joust and
the tournament were the frequent pastime of titled fine gentlemen who
could fight better than they could spell while religion was the passion
of their ladies and classifying their offspring into children of full
rank and children by brevet their pastime In fact all around religion
was in a peculiarly blooming condition the Council of Trent was being
called the Spanish Inquisition was roasting and racking and burning
with a free hand elsewhere on the continent the nations were being
persuaded to holy living by the sword and fire in England Henry VIII
had suppressed the monasteries burnt Fisher and another bishop or
two and was getting his English reformation and his harem effectively
started When De Soto stood on the banks of the Mississippi it was
still two years before Luthers death eleven years before the burning
of Servetus thirty years before the St Bartholomew slaughter Rabelais
was not yet published Don Quixote was not yet written Shakespeare
was not yet born a hundred long years must still elapse before
Englishmen would hear the name of Oliver Cromwell
Unquestionably the discovery of the Mississippi is a datable fact which
considerably mellows and modifies the shiny newness of our country and
gives her a most respectable outsideaspect of rustiness and antiquity
De Soto merely glimpsed the river then died and was buried in it by his
priests and soldiers One would expect the priests and the soldiers
to multiply the rivers dimensions by tenthe Spanish custom of the
dayand thus move other adventurers to go at once and explore it On
the contrary their narratives when they reached home did not excite
that amount of curiosity The Mississippi was left unvisited by whites
during a term of years which seems incredible in our energetic days One
may sense the interval to his mind after a fashion by dividing it
up in this way After De Soto glimpsed the river a fraction short of
a quarter of a century elapsed and then Shakespeare was born lived a
trifle more than half a century then died and when he had been in his
grave considerably more than half a century the SECOND white man saw
the Mississippi In our day we dont allow a hundred and thirty years to
elapse between glimpses of a marvel If somebody should discover a creek
in the county next to the one that the North Pole is in Europe and
America would start fifteen costly expeditions thither one to explore
the creek and the other fourteen to hunt for each other
For more than a hundred and fifty years there had been white settlements
on our Atlantic coasts These people were in intimate communication
with the Indians in the south the Spaniards were robbing slaughtering
enslaving and converting them higher up the English were trading beads
and blankets to them for a consideration and throwing in civilization
and whiskey for lagniappe and in Canada the French were schooling
them in a rudimentary way missionarying among them and drawing whole
populations of them at a time to Quebec and later to Montreal to buy
furs of them Necessarily then these various clusters of whites must
have heard of the great river of the far west and indeed they did
hear of it vaguelyso vaguely and indefinitely that its course
proportions and locality were hardly even guessable The mere
mysteriousness of the matter ought to have fired curiosity and compelled
exploration but this did not occur Apparently nobody happened to want
such a river nobody needed it nobody was curious about it so for
a century and a half the Mississippi remained out of the market and
undisturbed When De Soto found it he was not hunting for a river and
had no present occasion for one consequently he did not value it or
even take any particular notice of it
But at last La Salle the Frenchman conceived the idea of seeking out
that river and exploring it It always happens that when a man seizes
upon a neglected and important idea people inflamed with the same
notion crop up all around It happened so in this instance
Naturally the question suggests itself Why did these people want the
river now when nobody had wanted it in the five preceding generations
Apparently it was because at this late day they thought they had
discovered a way to make it useful for it had come to be believed
that the Mississippi emptied into the Gulf of California and therefore
afforded a short cut from Canada to China Previously the supposition
had been that it emptied into the Atlantic or Sea of Virginia
Chapter 2 The River and Its Explorers
LA SALLE himself sued for certain high privileges and they were
graciously accorded him by Louis XIV of inflated memory Chief among
them was the privilege to explore far and wide and build forts and
stake out continents and hand the same over to the king and pay the
expenses himself receiving in return some little advantages of one
sort or another among them the monopoly of buffalo hides He spent
several years and about all of his money in making perilous and painful
trips between Montreal and a fort which he had built on the Illinois
before he at last succeeded in getting his expedition in such a shape
that he could strike for the Mississippi
And meantime other parties had had better fortune In 1673 Joliet the
merchant and Marquette the priest crossed the country and reached the
banks of the Mississippi They went by way of the Great Lakes and from
Green Bay in canoes by way of Fox River and the Wisconsin Marquette
had solemnly contracted on the feast of the Immaculate Conception that
if the Virgin would permit him to discover the great river he would
name it Conception in her honor He kept his word In that day all
explorers traveled with an outfit of priests De Soto had twentyfour
with him La Salle had several also The expeditions were often out of
meat and scant of clothes but they always had the furniture and other
requisites for the mass they were always prepared as one of the quaint
chroniclers of the time phrased it to explain hell to the savages
On the 17th of June 1673 the canoes of Joliet and Marquette and
their five subordinates reached the junction of the Wisconsin with the
Mississippi Mr Parkman says Before them a wide and rapid current
coursed athwart their way by the foot of lofty heights wrapped thick
in forests He continues Turning southward they paddled down the
stream through a solitude unrelieved by the faintest trace of man
A big catfish collided with Marquettes canoe and startled him and
reasonably enough for he had been warned by the Indians that he was
on a foolhardy journey and even a fatal one for the river contained
a demon whose roar could be heard at a great distance and who would
engulf them in the abyss where he dwelt I have seen a Mississippi
catfish that was more than six feet long and weighed two hundred and
fifty pounds and if Marquettes fish was the fellow to that one he had
a fair right to think the rivers roaring demon was come
At length the buffalo began to appear grazing in herds on the great
prairies which then bordered the river and Marquette describes the
fierce and stupid look of the old bulls as they stared at the intruders
through the tangled mane which nearly blinded them
The voyagers moved cautiously Landed at night and made a fire to cook
their evening meal then extinguished it embarked again paddled some
way farther and anchored in the stream keeping a man on the watch till
morning
They did this day after day and night after night and at the end of two
weeks they had not seen a human being The river was an awful solitude
then And it is now over most of its stretch
But at the close of the fortnight they one day came upon the footprints
of men in the mud of the western banka Robinson Crusoe experience
which carries an electric shiver with it yet when one stumbles on it in
print They had been warned that the river Indians were as ferocious and
pitiless as the river demon and destroyed all comers without waiting
for provocation but no matter Joliet and Marquette struck into the
country to hunt up the proprietors of the tracks They found them by
and by and were hospitably received and well treatedif to be received
by an Indian chief who has taken off his last rag in order to appear
at his level best is to be received hospitably and if to be treated
abundantly to fish porridge and other game including dog and have
these things forked into ones mouth by the ungloved fingers of Indians
is to be well treated In the morning the chief and six hundred of his
tribesmen escorted the Frenchmen to the river and bade them a friendly
farewell
On the rocks above the present city of Alton they found some rude and
fantastic Indian paintings which they describe A short distance below
a torrent of yellow mud rushed furiously athwart the calm blue current
of the Mississippi boiling and surging and sweeping in its course logs
branches and uprooted trees This was the mouth of the Missouri that
savage river which descending from its mad career through a vast
unknown of barbarism poured its turbid floods into the bosom of its
gentle sister
By and by they passed the mouth of the Ohio they passed canebrakes
they fought mosquitoes they floated along day after day through the
deep silence and loneliness of the river drowsing in the scant shade
of makeshift awnings and broiling with the heat they encountered and
exchanged civilities with another party of Indians and at last
they reached the mouth of the Arkansas about a month out from their
startingpoint where a tribe of warwhooping savages swarmed out to
meet and murder them but they appealed to the Virgin for help so in
place of a fight there was a feast and plenty of pleasant palaver and
folderol
They had proved to their satisfaction that the Mississippi did not
empty into the Gulf of California or into the Atlantic They believed
it emptied into the Gulf of Mexico They turned back now and carried
their great news to Canada
But belief is not proof It was reserved for La Salle to furnish the
proof He was provokingly delayed by one misfortune after another but
at last got his expedition under way at the end of the year 1681 In the
dead of winter he and Henri de Tonty son of Lorenzo Tonty who invented
the tontine his lieutenant started down the Illinois with a
following of eighteen Indians brought from New England and twentythree
Frenchmen They moved in procession down the surface of the frozen
river on foot and dragging their canoes after them on sledges
At Peoria Lake they struck open water and paddled thence to the
Mississippi and turned their prows southward They plowed through the
fields of floating ice past the mouth of the Missouri past the mouth
of the Ohio byandby and gliding by the wastes of bordering swamp
landed on the 24th of February near the Third Chickasaw Bluffs where
they halted and built Fort Prudhomme
Again says Mr Parkman they embarked and with every stage of their
adventurous progress the mystery of this vast new world was more and
more unveiled More and more they entered the realms of spring The
hazy sunlight the warm and drowsy air the tender foliage the opening
flowers betokened the reviving life of nature
Day by day they floated down the great bends in the shadow of the dense
forests and in time arrived at the mouth of the Arkansas First they
were greeted by the natives of this locality as Marquette had before
been greeted by themwith the booming of the war drum and the flourish
of arms The Virgin composed the difficulty in Marquettes case the
pipe of peace did the same office for La Salle The white man and the
red man struck hands and entertained each other during three days Then
to the admiration of the savages La Salle set up a cross with the
arms of France on it and took possession of the whole country for the
kingthe cool fashion of the timewhile the priest piously consecrated
the robbery with a hymn The priest explained the mysteries of the faith
by signs for the saving of the savages thus compensating them with
possible possessions in Heaven for the certain ones on earth which they
had just been robbed of And also by signs La Salle drew from these
simple children of the forest acknowledgments of fealty to Louis the
Putrid over the water Nobody smiled at these colossal ironies
These performances took place on the site of the future town of
Napoleon Arkansas and there the first confiscationcross was raised
on the banks of the great river Marquettes and Joliets voyage
of discovery ended at the same spotthe site of the future town of
Napoleon When De Soto took his fleeting glimpse of the river away back
in the dim early days he took it from that same spotthe site of the
future town of Napoleon Arkansas Therefore three out of the four
memorable events connected with the discovery and exploration of the
mighty river occurred by accident in one and the same place It is a
most curious distinction when one comes to look at it and think about
it France stole that vast country on that spot the future Napoleon
and by and by Napoleon himself was to give the country back againmake
restitution not to the owners but to their white American heirs
The voyagers journeyed on touching here and there passed the sites
since become historic of Vicksburg and Grand Gulf and visited an
imposing Indian monarch in the Teche country whose capital city was a
substantial one of sunbaked bricks mixed with strawbetter houses than
many that exist there now The chiefs house contained an audience room
forty feet square and there he received Tonty in State surrounded by
sixty old men clothed in white cloaks There was a temple in the town
with a mud wall about it ornamented with skulls of enemies sacrificed to
the sun
The voyagers visited the Natchez Indians near the site of the
present city of that name where they found a religious and political
despotism a privileged class descended from the sun a temple and a
sacred fire It must have been like getting home again it was home
with an advantage in fact for it lacked Louis XIV
A few more days swept swiftly by and La Salle stood in the shadow of
his confiscating cross at the meeting of the waters from Delaware and
from Itaska and from the mountain ranges close upon the Pacific
with the waters of the Gulf of Mexico his task finished his prodigy
achieved Mr Parkman in closing his fascinating narrative thus sums
up
On that day the realm of France received on parchment a stupendous
accession The fertile plains of Texas the vast basin of the
Mississippi from its frozen northern springs to the sultry borders of
the Gulf from the woody ridges of the Alleghanies to the bare peaks
of the Rocky Mountainsa region of savannas and forests suncracked
deserts and grassy prairies watered by a thousand rivers ranged by
a thousand warlike tribes passed beneath the scepter of the Sultan of
Versailles and all by virtue of a feeble human voice inaudible at half
a mile
Chapter 3 Frescoes from the Past
APPARENTLY the river was ready for business now But no the
distribution of a population along its banks was as calm and deliberate
and timedevouring a process as the discovery and exploration had been
Seventy years elapsed after the exploration before the rivers borders
had a white population worth considering and nearly fifty more before
the river had a commerce Between La Salles opening of the river and
the time when it may be said to have become the vehicle of anything like
a regular and active commerce seven sovereigns had occupied the throne
of England America had become an independent nation Louis XIV and
Louis XV had rotted and died the French monarchy had gone down in
the red tempest of the revolution and Napoleon was a name that was
beginning to be talked about Truly there were snails in those days
The rivers earliest commerce was in great bargeskeelboats
broadhorns They floated and sailed from the upper rivers to New
Orleans changed cargoes there and were tediously warped and poled back
by hand A voyage down and back sometimes occupied nine months In time
this commerce increased until it gave employment to hordes of rough and
hardy men rude uneducated brave suffering terrific hardships with
sailorlike stoicism heavy drinkers coarse frolickers in moral sties
like the Natchezunderthehill of that day heavy fighters reckless
fellows every one elephantinely jolly foulwitted profane prodigal
of their money bankrupt at the end of the trip fond of barbaric
finery prodigious braggarts yet in the main honest trustworthy
faithful to promises and duty and often picturesquely magnanimous
By and by the steamboat intruded Then for fifteen or twenty years
these men continued to run their keelboats downstream and the steamers
did all of the upstream business the keelboatmen selling their boats in
New Orleans and returning home as deck passengers in the steamers
But after a while the steamboats so increased in number and in speed
that they were able to absorb the entire commerce and then keelboating
died a permanent death The keelboatman became a deck hand or a mate
or a pilot on the steamer and when steamerberths were not open to him
he took a berth on a Pittsburgh coalflat or on a pineraft constructed
in the forests up toward the sources of the Mississippi
In the heyday of the steamboating prosperity the river from end to end
was flaked with coalfleets and timber rafts all managed by hand
and employing hosts of the rough characters whom I have been trying to
describe I remember the annual processions of mighty rafts that used
to glide by Hannibal when I was a boyan acre or so of white
sweetsmelling boards in each raft a crew of two dozen men or more
three or four wigwams scattered about the rafts vast level space for
stormquartersand I remember the rude ways and the tremendous talk
of their big crews the exkeelboatmen and their admiringly patterning
successors for we used to swim out a quarter or third of a mile and get
on these rafts and have a ride
By way of illustrating keelboat talk and manners and that nowdeparted
and hardlyremembered raftlife I will throw in in this place a
chapter from a book which I have been working at by fits and starts
during the past five or six years and may possibly finish in the course
of five or six more The book is a story which details some passages in
the life of an ignorant village boy Huck Finn son of the town drunkard
of my time out west there He has run away from his persecuting
father and from a persecuting good widow who wishes to make a nice
truthtelling respectable boy of him and with him a slave of the
widows has also escaped They have found a fragment of a lumber raft
it is high water and dead summer time and are floating down the river
by night and hiding in the willows by daybound for Cairowhence
the negro will seek freedom in the heart of the free States But in a
fog they pass Cairo without knowing it By and by they begin to suspect
the truth and Huck Finn is persuaded to end the dismal suspense by
swimming down to a huge raft which they have seen in the distance ahead
of them creeping aboard under cover of the darkness and gathering the
needed information by eavesdropping
But you know a young person cant wait very well when he is impatient to
find a thing out We talked it over and by and by Jim said it was such
a black night now that it wouldnt be no risk to swim down to the big
raft and crawl aboard and listenthey would talk about Cairo because
they would be calculating to go ashore there for a spree maybe or
anyway they would send boats ashore to buy whiskey or fresh meat or
something Jim had a wonderful level head for a nigger he could most
always start a good plan when you wanted one
I stood up and shook my rags off and jumped into the river and struck
out for the rafts light By and by when I got down nearly to her
I eased up and went slow and cautious But everything was all
rightnobody at the sweeps So I swum down along the raft till I was
most abreast the camp fire in the middle then I crawled aboard and
inched along and got in amongst some bundles of shingles on the weather
side of the fire There was thirteen men therethey was the watch on
deck of course And a mighty roughlooking lot too They had a jug and
tin cups and they kept the jug moving One man was singingroaring
you may say and it wasnt a nice songfor a parlor anyway He roared
through his nose and strung out the last word of every line very long
When he was done they all fetched a kind of Injun warwhoop and then
another was sung It begun
There was a woman in our towdn In our towdn did dwedl dwell She
loved her husband dearilee But another man twyste as wedl
Singing too riloo riloo riloo Ritoo riloo rilay    e She
loved her husband dearilee But another man twyste as wedl
And so onfourteen verses It was kind of poor and when he was going
to start on the next verse one of them said it was the tune the old cow
died on and another one said Oh give us a rest And another one
told him to take a walk They made fun of him till he got mad and jumped
up and begun to cuss the crowd and said he could lame any thief in the
lot
They was all about to make a break for him but the biggest man there
jumped up and says
Set whar you are gentlemen Leave him to me hes my meat
Then he jumped up in the air three times and cracked his heels together
every time He flung off a buckskin coat that was all hung with fringes
and says You lay thar tell the chawinups done and flung his hat
down which was all over ribbons and says You lay thar tell his
sufferins is over
Then he jumped up in the air and cracked his heels together again and
shouted out
Whoooop Im the old original ironjawed brassmounted
copperbellied corpsemaker from the wilds of ArkansawLook at me
Im the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation Sired by a
hurricane damd by an earthquake halfbrother to the cholera nearly
related to the smallpox on the mothers side Look at me I take
nineteen alligators and a barl of whiskey for breakfast when Im in
robust health and a bushel of rattlesnakes and a dead body when Im
ailing I split the everlasting rocks with my glance and I squench the
thunder when I speak Whoooop Stand back and give me room according
to my strength Bloods my natural drink and the wails of the dying is
music to my ear Cast your eye on me gentlemenand lay low and hold
your breath for Im bout to turn myself loose
All the time he was getting this off he was shaking his head and
looking fierce and kind of swelling around in a little circle tucking
up his wristbands and now and then straightening up and beating his
breast with his fist saying Look at me gentlemen When he got
through he jumped up and cracked his heels together three times and
let off a roaring Whoooop Im the bloodiest son of a wildcat that
lives
Then the man that had started the row tilted his old slouch hat down
over his right eye then he bent stooping forward with his back sagged
and his south end sticking out far and his fists ashoving out and
drawing in in front of him and so went around in a little circle
about three times swelling himself up and breathing hard Then he
straightened and jumped up and cracked his heels together three times
before he lit again that made them cheer and he begun to shout like
this
Whoooop bow your neck and spread for the kingdom of sorrows
acoming Hold me down to the earth for I feel my powers aworking
whoooop Im a child of sin dont let me get a start Smoked
glass here for all Dont attempt to look at me with the naked
eye gentlemen When Im playful I use the meridians of longitude and
parallels of latitude for a seine and drag the Atlantic Ocean for
whales I scratch my head with the lightning and purr myself to sleep
with the thunder When Im cold I bile the Gulf of Mexico and bathe
in it when Im hot I fan myself with an equinoctial storm when Im
thirsty I reach up and suck a cloud dry like a sponge when I range the
earth hungry famine follows in my tracks Whoooop Bow your neck and
spread I put my hand on the suns face and make it night in the earth
I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons I shake myself
and crumble the mountains Contemplate me through leatherdont use the
naked eye Im the man with a petrified heart and bileriron bowels The
massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments
the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life The
boundless vastness of the great American desert is my enclosed property
and I bury my dead on my own premises He jumped up and cracked his
heels together three times before he lit they cheered him again and
as he come down he shouted out Whoooop bow your neck and spread for
the pet child of calamitys acoming
Then the other one went to swelling around and blowing againthe first
onethe one they called Bob next the Child of Calamity chipped in
again bigger than ever then they both got at it at the same time
swelling round and round each other and punching their fists most into
each others faces and whooping and jawing like Injuns then Bob called
the Child names and the Child called him names back again next Bob
called him a heap rougher names and the Child come back at him with the
very worst kind of language next Bob knocked the Childs hat off and
the Child picked it up and kicked Bobs ribbony hat about six foot Bob
went and got it and said never mind this warnt going to be the last
of this thing because he was a man that never forgot and never forgive
and so the Child better look out for there was a time acoming just
as sure as he was a living man that he would have to answer to him with
the best blood in his body The Child said no man was willinger than
he was for that time to come and he would give Bob fair warning now
never to cross his path again for he could never rest till he had waded
in his blood for such was his nature though he was sparing him now on
account of his family if he had one
Both of them was edging away in different directions growling and
shaking their heads and going on about what they was going to do but a
little blackwhiskered chap skipped up and says
Come back here you couple of chickenlivered cowards and Ill thrash
the two of ye
And he done it too He snatched them he jerked them this way and that
he booted them around he knocked them sprawling faster than they could
