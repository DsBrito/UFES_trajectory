THE WAY TO THE TEMPLE
DEAR MR PUNCH    Willesden Junction
Having been assured by a Phrenologist that my bump of locality is very
highly developed I attempted the other dayalthough a perfect stranger
to Londonto walk from Charing Cross to the Temple without inquiring
the route I had absolutely no assistance but a small map of Surbiton
and the neighbourhood from which I had calculated the general lie of
the country and a plain ordinary compass which I had bought cheap
because it had lost its pointer I am not sure that the route I took was
the most direct But when after several hours walk I found myself at
Willesden Junction I was assured by a boy in the district whom I
asked that I could not possibly have gone straighter He advised me to
take a ticket at once for Chalk Farm as I still had some way to go and
said that he thought I might have to change at Battersea He was a nice
bright little boy and laughed quite merrily
I have now been at Willesden Junction for eighteen hours and I have not
yet secured a train for Chalk Farm There have been several but they
have always gone from the platform which I had just left So I have
camped out on the 101th platform and I intend to stop there till a
train for Chalk Farm comes in Of course the porters have remonstrated
and tried to explain where and when the train really does start But I
would sooner trust my natural instincts than any porter That bright
little boy has been twice to see how I am getting on He brought two
other boys last time They all told me to stick to it and seemed much
amusedprobably at the stupidity of those porters But really Mr
Punch Willesden Junction ought to be simplified It may be all very
well for me with a phrenological aptitude for this sort of thing but
these different levels platforms and stairs must be very puzzling to
less gifted people such as the green young man from the country
But the last suggestion which I have to make is the most important
There ought to be a great many more doors into the refreshmentroom
and only one door out of it I lost the thirteenth train for Chalk Farm
by going out of the wrong door One door out would be ample and it
should certainly be madeby an easy arrangement of pivots and pneumatic
pressureto open straight into the train for anywhere where you wanted
to go If this simple alteration cannot be made Willesden Junction must
be destroyed at once route and branch or removed to Hampton Court to
take the place of the present absurdly easy Maze I am Mr Punch

MODERN TYPES
By Mr Punchs Own TypeWriter
No VIITHE PATRON OF SPORT
IN order to qualify properly for the patronage of sport a man must
finally abandon any vestiges of refinement which may remain to him after
a youth spent mainly in the use of strong language and the abuse of
strong drink The future patron who has enjoyed for some years the
advantages of a neglected training in the privacy of the domestic
circle will have been sent to a public school Like a vicious book he
will soon have been called in though not until he has been cut by
those who may have been brought in contact with him Having thus left
his school for his schools good he will find no difficulty in
persuading his parents that the high spirits of an ingenuous youth
however distasteful they may have been to the ridiculous prejudices of a
pedantic Head Master are certain to be properly appreciated by the
officers of a crack Regiment He will therefore decide to enter the
Army and after pursuing his arduous studies for some time at the
various Music Halls and drinking saloons of the Metropolis he will
administer a public reproof to the Civil Service Commissioners by
declining on two separate occasions to pass the examination for
admission into Sandhurst
He will then inform his father that he is heavily in debt and having
borrowed money from his tailor he will disappear from the parental ken
to turn up again after a week without his watch his scarfpin or his
studs This freak will be accepted by his relatives as a convincing
proof of his fitness for a financial career and he will shortly be
transferred to the City as Clerk to a firm of Stockbrokers Here his
versatile talents will have full scope He will manage to reconcile a
somewhat lax attention to the details of business with a strict
regularity in his attendance at suburban racemeetings Nothing will be
allowed to stand in his way when he pursues the shadow of pleasure
through the most devious windings into the lowest haunts For him the
resources of dissipation are never exhausted Pothouses provide him
with cocktails restaurants furnish him with elaborate dinners tailors
array him in fine clothes hosiers collar him up to the chin and cover
his breast with immaculate fronts The masterpieces of WestEnd
jewellers hatters and bootmakers sparkle on various portions of his
person he finds in a lady stepdancer a goddess and in Ruffs Guide
a Bible he sups he swears he drinks and he gambles and finally he
attains to the summit of earthly felicity by finding himself mentioned
under a nickname in the paragraphs of a sporting organ
Having about the same time engaged in a midnight brawl with an
undersized and middleaged cabman he appears the next morning in a
Police Court and after being fined forty shillings is hailed as a
hero by his companions and recognised as a genuine Patron of Sport by
the world at large Henceforward his position is assured He becomes the
boon companion of Musichall Chairmen and lives on terms of intimate
vulgarity with Moneylenders who find that it pays to take a low
interest in the pleasures in order the more easily to obtain a high
interest on the borrowings of reckless young men
Illustration
In company with these associates and with others of more or less
repute the Patron of Sport sets the seal to his patronage by becoming a
member of a socalled Sporting Club at which professional pugilists
batter one another in order to provide excitement for a mixed assemblage
of coarse and brainless rowdies and the feeble toadies who dance
attendance upon them Here the Patron is at his best and noblest Though
he has never worn a glove in anger nor indeed taken the smallest part
in any genuine athletic exercise he is as free with his opinions as he
is unsparing of the adjectives wherewith he adorns them He talks
learnedly of uppercuts and crosscounters and grows humorous over
mousetraps piledrivers on the mark and the flow of the ruby
Having absorbed four whiskeysandsoda he will observe that
if a fellow refuses to train properly he must expect to be
receivergeneral and after lighting his tenth cigar as a tribute
presumably to the lung power of the combatants will indulge in some
moody reflections on the decay of British valour and the general
degeneracy of Englishmen He will then drink liqueur brandy out of a
claret glass and having slapped a sporting solicitor on the back and
dug in the ribs a gentleman jockey who has been warned off the course
he will tread on the toes of an inoffensive stranger who has allowed
himself to be elected a member of the Club under the mistaken impression
that it was the home of sportsmen and the sanctuary of honest boxers
After duly characterising the strangers eyes and his awkwardness the
Patron will resume his seat near the ropes and will stare vacuously at
the brilliant gathering of touts loafers parasites usurers
bookmakers brokendown racing men seedy soldiers and overfed City
men who are assembled round the room Inspired by their society with the
conviction that he is assisting in an important capacity in the revival
of a manly sport he will adjust his hat on the back of his head rap
with his goldheaded cane upon the floor and call Timea humorous
sally which is always much appreciated especially when the ring is
empty After witnessing the first three rounds of the next competition
he will rise to depart and observing a lookingglass will excite the
laughter of his friends and the admiration of the waiters by sparring
one round with his own reflection finally falling into the arms of a
companion whom he adjures not to mind him but to sponge up the other
fellow
After this exploit a supperclub receives him and he is made much of by
those of both sexes who are content to thrive temporarily on the money
of a friend He will then drive a hansom through the streets and
having knocked over a hot potatostall he will compensate the
proprietor with a round of oaths and a fivepound note
In appearance the Patron of Sport is unwholesome The bloom of youth
vanished from his face before he ceased to be a boy he assumes the worn
and sallow mask of age before he has fairly begun to be a man His hair
is thin and is carefully flattened by the aid of unguents his dress is
flashy his moustache thick In order the more closely to imitate a true
sportsman he wears a baggy overcoat with large buttons Yet he abhors
all kinds of honest exercise and in the days of his prosperity keeps
a small brougham with yellow wheels Soon after he reaches the age of
thirty he begins to feel the effects of his variegated life He fails
in landing a big coup on the Stock Exchange and loses much money over
a Newmarket meeting in which he plunges on a succession of rank
outsiders whom a set of rascals more cunning than himself have
represented to him as certainties His position on the Stock Exchange
becomes shaky and he attempts to restore it by embarking with a gang of
needy rogues on a firstclass roping transaction in connection with a
prizefight in Spain Having however been exposed he is shunned by
most of those who only heard of the swindle when it was too late to join
in it
This is the beginning of the end He becomes careless of his appearance
with the decrease of his means his coats become shiny and his cuffs
more and more frayed Eventually he falls into a state of sodden
imbecility relieved by occasional flashes of delirium tremens and dies
at the age of thirtysix regretted by nobody except the faithful
bulldog whose silver collar was the last thing he pawned

PLAYTIME
SINCE the first night if hearsay evidence can be accepted as I didnt
see the premiere Mr SUGDEN must have immensely improved his
Touchstone He plays it now with much dry quaint humour and when I
saw him in the part last week every line told with a decidedly
discriminating but appreciative audience His scenes with that capital
Audrey Miss MARION LEA and with William were uncommonly good I
confess I was surprised Mr BOURCHIERbut now an amateur now
thusgives Jaques immortal speech of All the worlds a stage in a
thoroughly natural and unconventional manner chiefly remarkable for the
absence of every gesture or tone that could make it a mere theatrical
recitation by a modern professional reciter at a picnic Mrs LANGTRYS
Rosalind is charming her scenes with Orlando being as pretty a
piece of acting as any honest playgoer could wish to see And what a
pretty Lamb is she they call BEATRICE who plays Phoebe What a
sweet gentle restful play it is How unlike these bustling times To
witness this idyllic romance as it is put on at the St Jamess is as
if one had stepped aside out of the movement had bid adieu for a
while to the madding crowd and had plunged into the depths of the
forest of Arden to find a tranquil society of friends among whom
under the greenwood tree one can rest and be thankful
I was curious to see how ALEXANDER the Getting Great would comport
himself as the hero of light farce associated as he has always hitherto
been with heroes of romance and high comedy The theatregoing public
and his admirersthe terms are synonymousmay breathe again ALEXANDER
is surprisingly good as Dr Bill and the serious earnestness with
which he invests the part intensifies the drollery of the complications
And to think that the adapter of this gay and festive piece should be
none other than the sentimental troubadour songwriter and composer
author of a Lyceum Tragedy and other similar trifles Mr HAMILTON
AIDE Sir in future will HAMILTON AIDE say when being interviewed
by a Manager I will now read you my Five Act Tragedy entitled
Hang your tragedies will the Manager exclaim Give me a farce like
