now met his ear as a loud medley of noises and voices rising from
hundreds of men who were encamped in the wide space before himin
groups or singly sleeping and snoring or quarrelling eating talking
and singing as they squatted on the ground which was strewn with straw
The inn was full and more than half of the humble guests were monks
who during the last two days had flowed into the city from every
Cenoby Laura and hermitage in the desert and from most of the
monasteries in the surrounding districtthe Nitriote Nome Some of
them had laid their heads close together for confidential whispering
others squabbled loudly and a large group in the northern angle of
the court had raised a psalm which mingled strangely with the three
four seven of the men who were playing mora and the cry of
the cook inviting purchasers to his stall spread with meat bread and
onions
At the end of the court furthest from the gateway there was a covered
way on to which a row of doors opened leading to the rooms devoted to
families of women and children each apartment being divided into two by
a curtain across the middle The stranger made his way into one of these
rooms where he was warmly welcomed by a young man who was occupied in
cutting a Kopais reed into a mouthpiece for a double flute and by a
tall matronly woman
The newcomers name was Karnis and he was the head of a family of
wandering singers who had arrived in Alexandria only the day before
from Rome His surroundings were poor and mean for their ship had been
attacked off the African coast by a band of pirates and though they
had saved their lives they had lost everything they possessed The
young owner of the vessel to whom he owed his safety had procured him
admission to this Xenodochiuma refuge or innkept by his mother
the Widow Mary Karnis had however found it far from comfortable and
had gone forth at noon to seek other quarters
All in vain said he as he wiped the heat drops from his forehead
I have hunted Medius half the city through and found him at last at the
house of Posidonius the Magian whose assistant he is There was singing
behind a curtainwretched rubbish but there were some old airs too
with an accompaniment on the flutes in the style of Olympus and really
not so bad
Then spirits appeared By Sirius a queer business altogether Medius
is in the midst of it all I arranged the chorus and sang with them a
little All I got for it was a little dirty silverthere But as for
a lodgingfree quartersthere are none to be found here for anything
above an owl and then there is the edictthat cursed edict
During this speech the younger man had exchanged meaning glances
with his mother He now interrupted Karnis saying in a tone of
encouragement
Never mind father we have something good in view
You have said the old man with an incredulous shrug while his wife
served him with a small roast chicken on a stool which did duty for a
table
Yes father we the lad went on laying aside his knife You know we
vowed an offering to Dionysus for our escape since he himself once fell
into the hands of pirates so we went at once to his temple Mother knew
the way and as weshe I mean and Dada and myself
Heh what is this interrupted Karnis now for the first time noticing
the dish before him A fowlwhen we are so miserably poor A whole
fowl and cooked with oil He spoke angrily but his wife laying her
hand on his shoulder said soothingly
We shall soon earn it again Never a sesterce was won by fretting
Enjoy todays gifts and the gods will provide for tomorrow
Indeed asked Karnis in an altered key To be sure when a roast fowl
flies into ones mouth instead of a pigeon But you are right as
usual Herse as usual onlyhere am I battening like a senator while
youI lay a wager you have drunk nothing but milk all day and eaten
nothing but bread and radishes I thought so Then the chicken must
pretend to be a pheasant and you wife will eat this leg The girls
are gone to bed Why here is some wine too Fill up your cup boy A
libation to the God Glory to Dionysus The two men poured the libation
on the floor and drank then the father thrust his knife into the breast
of the bird and began his meal with a will while Orpheus the son went
on with his story
Well the temple of Dionysus was not to be found for Bishop Theophilus
has had it destroyed so to what divinity could we offer our wreath
and cake Here in Egypt there is none but the great Mother Isis Her
sanctuary is on the shore of Lake Mareotis and mother found it at once
There she fell into conversation with a priestess who as soon as she
learnt that my mother belonged to a family of musiciansthough Dame
Herse was cautious in announcing this factand hoped to find employment
in Alexandria led her away to a young lady who was closely veiled This
lady Orpheus went onhe not only played the flute but took the higher
parts for a mans voice and could also strike the lyredesired us to
go to her later at her own house where she would speak with us She
drove off in a fine carriage and we of course followed her orders Agne
was with us too A splendid house I never saw anything handsomer in
Rome or Antioch We were kindly received and with the lady there were
another very old lady and a tall grave man a priest I should fancy or a
philosopher or something of that kind
Not some Christian trap asked Karnis suspiciously You do not know
this place and since the edict
Never fear father There were images of the gods in the halls
and corridors and in the room where we were received by Gorgo the
beautiful daughter of Porphyrius there was an altar before an image of
Isis quite freshly anointedThis Porphyrius is a very rich merchant
we learnt that afterwards and many other things The philosopher asked
us at once whether we were aware that Theodosius had lately promulgated
a new edict forbidding young maidens to appear in public as singers or
fluteplayers
And did Agne hear that said the old man in a low voice as he pointed
to the curtain
No she and Dada were in the garden on to which the room opened and
mother explained at once that though Agne was a Christian she was a very
good girl and that so long as she remained in our service she was bound
to sing with us whenever she was required The philosopher exclaimed
at once The very thing and they whispered together and called the
girls and desired them to show what they could do
And how did they perform asked the old man who was growing excited
Dada warbled like a lark and Agnewell you know how it always is Her
voice sounded lovely but it was just as usual You can guess how much
there is in her and how deep her feeling is but she never quite brings
it out What has she to complain of with us And yet whatever she sings
has that mournful painful ring which even you can do nothing to alter
However she pleased them better than Dada did for I noticed that Gorgo
and the gentleman glanced at each other and at her and whispered a word
now and then which certainly referred to Ague When they had sung two
songs the young lady came towards us and praised both the girls and
asked whether we would undertake to learn something quite new I told
her that my father was a great musician who could master the most
difficult things at the first hearing
The most difficult Hm that depends said the old man Did she
show it you
No it is something in the style of Linus and she sang it to us
The daughter of the rich Porphyrius sang for your entertainment
Yours said Karnis laughing By Sirius The world is turning upside
down Now that girls are forbidden to perform to the gentlefolks art is
being cultivated by the upper classes it cannot be killed outright For
the future the listeners will be paid to keep quiet and the singers pay
for the right of torturing their earsour ears our luckless ears will
be victimized
Orpheus smiled and shook his head then again dropping his knife he
went on eagerly
But if you could only hear her You would give your last copper piece
to hear her again
Indeed muttered his father Well there are very good teachers here
Something by Linus did you say she sang
Something of that kind a lament for the dead of very great power
Return oh return my beloved came backcome home that was the
burthen of it And there was a passage which said Oh that each tear
had a voice and could join with me in calling thee And how she sang
it father I do not think I ever in my life heard anything like it Ask
mother Even Dadas eyes were full of tears
Yes it was beautiful the mother agreed I could not help wishing
that you were there
Karnis rose and paced the little room waving his arms and muttering
Ah so that is how it is A friend of the Muses We saved the large
lutethat is well My chlamys has an ugly hole in itif the girls were
not asleep but the first thing tomorrow Ague Tell me is she
handsome tall
Herse had been watching her excitable husband with much satisfaction
and now answered his question Not a Heranot a Musedecidedly not
Hardly above the middle height slightly made but not small black
eyes long lashes dark straight eyebrows I could hardly like Orpheus
call her beautiful
Oh yes motherBeautiful is a great word and one my father has
taught me to use but rarely but sheif she is not beautiful who
iswhen she raised her large dark eyes and threw back her head to
bring out her lament tone after tone seemed to come from the bottom of
her heart and rise to the furthest height of heaven Ah if Agne could
learn to sing like that Throw your whole soul into your singingYou
have told her that again and again Now Gorgo can and does And she
stood there as steady and as highly strung as a bow every note came out
with the ring of an arrow and went straight to the heart as clear and
pure as possible
Be silent cried the old man covering his ears with his hands I
shall not close an eye till daylight and then Orpheus take
that silvertake it all I have no morego early to market and buy
flowerslaurel branches ivy violets and roses But no lotuses though
the market here is full of them they are showy boastful things with
no scent I cannot bear them We will go crowned to the Temple of the
Muses
Buy away buy all you want said Herse laughing as she showed her
husband some bright gold pieces We got that today and if all is
well Here she paused pointed to the curtain and went on again in
a lower tone It all depends of course on Agnes playing us no trick
How so Why She is a good girl and I will
No no said Herse holding him back She does not know yet what the
business is The lady wants her
Well
To sing in the Temple of Isis
Karnis colored He was suddenly called from a lovely dream back to the
squalid reality In the Temple of Isis he said gloomily Agne In
the face of all the people And she knows nothing about it
Nothing father
No Well then if that is the case Agne the Christian in the
Temple of Isishere here where Bishop Theophilus is destroying
all our sanctuaries and the monks outdo their master Ah children
children how pretty and round and bright a soapbubble is and how soon
it bursts Do you know at all what it is that you are planning If the
black flies smell it out and it becomes known by the great Apollo
we should have fared better at the hands of the pirates And yet and
yetDo you know at all how the girl
She wept at the ladys singing interrupted Herse eagerly and
silent as she generally is on her way home she said To sing like
that She is a happy girl
Karnis looked up with renewed confidence
Ah he exclaimed that is my Agne Yes yes she truly loves her
divine art She can sing she will sing We will venture it if you I
all of us die for it
Herse Orpheus what have we to lose Our gods too shall have their
martyrs It is a poor life that has no excitement Our artwhy all
I have ever had has been devoted to it I make no boast of having
sacrificed everything and if gold and lands were again to be mine I
would become a beggar once more for the sake of art We have always held
the divine Muse sacred but who can keep up a brave heart when he sees
her persecuted She may only be worshipped in darkness in these days
and the Queen of Gods and men shuns the light like a moth a bat an
owl If we must die let it be with and for Her Once more let pure and
perfect song rejoice this old heart and if afterwards My children
we have no place in this dim colorless world While the Arts lived
there was Spring on the earth Now they are condemned to death and it
is Winter The leaves fall from all the trees and we piping birds need
groves to sing in How often already has Death laid his hand on our
shoulder every breath we draw is a boon of mercythe extra length
given in by the weaver the hour of grace granted by the hangman to his
victim Our lives are no longer our own a borrowed purse with damaged
copper coins The hardhearted creditor has already bent his knuckles
and when he knocks the time is up Once more let us have one hour of
pure and perfect enjoyment and then we will pay up capital and interest
when we must
It cannot and will not be yet said Herse resolutely but she wiped
her eyes with her band If Agne sings even so long as she does it
without coercion and of her own freewill no Bishop can punish us
He cannot he dare not cried the old man There are still laws and
judges
And Gorgos family is influential as well as rich Porphyrius has power
to protect us and you do not yet know what a fancy he has taken to us
Ask mother
It is like a story Herse put in Before we left the old ladyshe
must be eighty or moretook me aside and asked me where we were
lodging I told her at the Widow Marys and when she heard it she struck
her crutch on the floor Do you like the place she asked I told her
not at all and said we could not possibly stop here
Quite right cried Karnis The monks in the courtyard will kill us
as dead as rats if they hear us learning heathen hymns
That is what I told her but the old lady did not allow me to finish
she drew me close to her and whispered only do as my granddaughter
wishes and you shall be safely housed and take this for the
presentand she put her hand into the purse at her girdle gave the
gold into my hand and added loud enough for the others to hear Fifty
gold pieces out of my own pocket if Gorgo tells me that she is satisfied
with your performance
Fifty gold pieces cried Karnis clasping his hands That brightens
up the dull grey of existence Fifty then are certain If we sing six
times that makes a talentestimated in 1880 at 1100and that will
buy back our old vineyard at Leontium I will repair the old Odeumthey
have made a cowhouse of itand when we sing there the monks may come
and listen You laugh But you are simpletonsI should like to see who
will forbid my singing on my own land and in my own country A talent of
gold
It is quite enough to pay on account and I will not agree to any
bargain that will not give me the fieldslaves and cattle Castles in
the air do you say But just listen to me We are sure you see of
a hundred gold pieces at least He had raised his voice in his
eagerness and while he spoke the curtains had been softly opened and
the dull glimmer of the lamp which stood in front of Orpheus fell on a
head which was charming in spite of its disorder A quantity of loose
fair hair curled in papers stuck up all over the round head and fell
over the forehead the eyes were tired and still half shut but the
little mouth was wide awake and laughing with the frank amusement of
lighthearted youth
Karnis without noticing the listener had gone on with his visionary
hopes of regaining his estates by his next earnings but at this point
the young girl holding the curtain in her right hand stretched out her
plump left arm and begged in a humble whine
Good father Karnis give me a little of your wealth five poor little
drachmae
The old man started but he instantly recovered himself and answered
goodnaturedly enough
Go back to bed you little hussy You ought to be asleep instead of
listening there
Asleep said the girl While you are shouting like an orator against
the wind Five drachmae father I stick to that A new ribband for me
will cost one and the same for Agne two Two I will spend on wine for
us all and that makes the five
That makes fouryou are a great arithmetician to be sure
Four said Dada as much amazed as though the moon had fallen If
only I had a countingframe No father five I tell youit is five
No child four and you shall have four replied her father Plutus
is at the door and tomorrow morning you shall both have garlands
Yes of violets ivy and roses added Dame Herse Is Agne asleep
As sound as the dead She always sleeps soundly unless she lies wide
awake all the night through But we were both so tiredand I am still
It is a comfort to yawn Do you see how I am sitting
On the clotheschest said Herse
Yes and the curtain is not a strong back to the seat Fortunately if I
fall asleep I shall drop forwards not backwards
But there is a bed for each of you said the mother and giving the
girl a gentle push she followed her into the sleepingalcove In a few
minutes she came out again
That is just like Dada she exclaimed Little Papias had rolled off
the chest on which he was sleeping so the good girl had put him into
her bed and was sitting on the chest herself tired as she was
She would do anything for that boy said Karnis But it is past
midnight Come Orpheus let us make the bed
Three long hencoops which stood piled against the wall were laid on
the ground and covered with mats on these the tired men stretched their
limbs but they could not sleep
The little lamp was extinguished and for an hour all was still in the
dark room Then suddenly there was a loud commotion some elastic
object flew against the wall with a loud flap and Karnis starting up
called out Get outmonster
What is it cried Herse who had also been startled and the old man
replied angrily
Some daemon some dog of a daemon is attacking me and giving me no
peace Wait you villainthere perhaps that will settle you and he
flung his second sandal Then without heeding the rustling fall of some
object that he had hit by accident he gasped out
The impudent fiend will not let me be It knows that we need Agnes
voice and it keeps whispering first in one ear and then in the other
that I should threaten to sell her little brother if she refuses but
IIstrike a light OrpheusShe is a good girl and rather than do
such a thing
The daemon has been close to me too said the son as he blew on the
spark he had struck
And to me too added Herse nervously It is only natural There are
no images of the gods in this Christian hovel Away hateful serpent
We are honest folks and will not agree to any vile baseness Here is my
amulet Karnis if the daemon comes again you must turn it roundyou
know how
CHAPTER II
Early next morning the singers set out for the house of Porphyrius The
party was not complete however for Dada had been forced to remain at
home The shoes that the old man had flung to scare away the daemon had
caught in the girls dress which she had just washed and had dragged
it down on to the earth she had found it in the morning full of holes
burnt by the ashes into the damp material Dada had no other presentable
garment so in spite of her indignant refusal and many tears she had
to remain indoors with Papias Agnes anxious offers to stay in her
place with the little boy and to lend Dada her dress both Karnis and
his wife had positively refused and Dada had lent her aidat first
silently though willingly and then with her usual merrimentin twining
garlands for the others and in dressing Agnes smooth black plaits with
a wreath of ivy and violets
The men were already washed anointed and crowned with poplar and laurel
when a steward arrived from Porphyrius to bid them follow him to his
masters house But a small sacrifice was necessary for the messenger
desired them to lay aside their wreaths which would excite illfeeling
among the monks and certainly be snatched off by the Christian mob
Karnis when he started was greatly disappointed and as much depressed
as he had been triumphant and hopeful a short time before
The monks who had gathered outside the Xenodochium glanced with
scowling suspicion at the party who could not recover the good spirits
with which they had begun the day till they were fairly out of the
narrow gloomy alleys reeking with tar and salt fish that adjoined the
harbor and where they had to push their way through a dense throng
The steward led the van with Herse talking freely in reply to her
enquiries
His master he said was one of the great merchants of the city whose
wife had died twenty years since in giving birth to Gorgo His two sons
were at present absent on their travels The old lady who had been
so liberal in her treatment of the singers was Damia the mother of
Porphyrius She had a fine fortune of her own and notwithstanding her
great age was still respected as the soul of business in the household
and as a woman deeply versed in the mysterious sciences Mary the pious
Christian who had founded the House of the Holy Martyr was the
widow of Apelles the brother of Porphyrius but she had ceased all
intercourse with her husbands family This was but natural as she was
at the head of the Christian women of Alexandria while the household
of Porphyriusthough the master himself had been baptizedwas as
thoroughly heathen as any in Alexandria
Karnis heard nothing of all this for he came last of the party Orpheus
and Agne followed next to Herse and the steward and after them came two
slaves carrying the lutes and pipes Agne walked with downcast eyes
as if she desired to avoid seeing all that surrounded her though when
Orpheus addressed her she shyly glanced up at him and answered briefly
and timidly They presently came out of an obscure alley by the canal
connecting Kibotus with Lake Mareotis where the Nileboats lay at
anchor Karnis drew a deeper breath for here the air was clear and
balmy a light northerly breeze brought the refreshing fragrance of
the sea and the slender palmtrees that bordered the canal threw long
shadows mingling with the massive shade of the sycamores The road was
astir with busy groups birds sang in the trees and the old musician
drank in the exciting and aromatic atmosphere of the Egyptian Spring
with keen enjoyment
As they reached the middle of the steep bridge across the canal he
involuntarily stood still riveted by the view of the southwest In his
excitement he threw up his arms his eyes glistened with moisture and
with the enthusiasm of youth and as was always the case when his
emotions were stirred by some glorious work of God or man an image rose
to his mind all unbiddenthe image of his eldest son now dead but
in life his closest and most sympathetic comrade He felt as though
his hand could grasp the shoulder of that son too early snatched away
whose gifts had far transcended those of the surviving Orpheusas
though he too could gaze with him on the grand scene that lay before
him
On a platform of rocks and mighty masonry rose a structure of wonderful
magnificence and beauty so brilliantly illuminated by the morning
sun that its noble proportions and gorgeous colors showed in dazzling
splendor and relief Over the gilt dome bent the cloudless blue of the
African sky and the polished hemisphere shone as radiant as the sun
whose beams it reflected Sloping planes for vehicles and flights
of steps for pedestrians led up to the gates The lower part of this
wonderful edificethe great Temple of Serapiswas built to stand
forever and the pillars of the vestibule supported a roof more fitted
to the majesty of the gods than to the insignificance of mortals
priests and worshippers moved here like children among the trunks of
some gigantic forest Round the cornice in hundreds of niches and on
every projection all the gods of Olympus and all the heroes and sages
of Greece seemed to have met in conclave and stood gazing down on the
world in gleaming brass or tinted marble Every portion of the building
blazed with gold and vivid coloring the painters hand had added life
to the marble groups in high relief that filled the pediments and the
smaller figures in the long row of metopes All the population of a town
might have found refuge in the vast edifice and its effect on the mind
was like that of a harmonious symphony of adoration sung by a chorus of
giants
All hail Great Serapis I greet thee in joyful humility thankful that
Thou hast granted to my old eyes to see Thy glorious and eternal temple
once again murmured Karnis in devout contemplation Then appealing
to his wife and son he pointed in silence to the building Presently
however as he watched Orpheus gazing in speechless delight at its
magnificent proportions he could not forbear
This he began with fervid enthusiasm is the stronghold of Serapis
the King of the Gods A work for all time Its youth has lasted five
hundred years its future will extend to all eternityAye so it
is and so long as it endures in all its glory the old gods cannot be
deposed
No one will ever dare to touch a stone of it said the steward Every
child in Alexandria knows that the world will crumble into dust and
ashes if a finger is laid on that Temple and the man who ventures to
touch the sacred image
The god can protect himself interrupted the singer But youyou
Christian hypocrites who pretend to hate life and love deathif you
really long so vehemently for the end of all things you have only to
fall upon this glorious structureDo that do thatonly do that
The old man shook his fist at the invisible foe and Herse echoed his
words
Aye aye only do that Then she added more calmly Well if
everything comes to an end at once the enemies of the gods will die with
us and there can be nothing terrible in perishing at the same time with
everything that is beautiful or dear to us
Nevertheless said the steward the Bishop has put out his hand
to touch the sanctuary But our noble Olympius would not suffer the
sacrilegious host to approach and they had to retire with broken
heads Serapis will not be mocked he will stand though all else perish
Eternity the priest tells us is to him but as an instant and while
millions of generations bloom and fade he is still and forever the
same
Hail all hail to the great god cried Orpheus with hands outstretched
towards the temple
Yea hail for everlasting glory shall be his repeated his father
Great is Serapis and his house and his image shall last
Till the next full moon said a passerby in a tone of sinister
mockery shaking his fist in the face as it were of the god Orpheus
turned quickly to punish the prophet of evil but he had disappeared in
the crowd and the tide of men had borne him onwards Till the next full
moon murmured Agne who had shuddered at her companions rapturous
ejaculations and she glanced uneasily at Orpheus but by the time Herse
addressed her a minute or two later she had controlled the expression of
her features and the matrons heart was gladdened by her bright
smile Nay many a young Alexandrian passing the group on foot or in a
carriage looked at her a second time for that smile lent a mysterious
charm to her pale calm face Nor had it faded away when they had
crossed the bridge and were nearing the shores of the lake for an idea
once conceived lingered long in Agnes mind and as she walked on in
the bright glory of the mornings sun her minds eye was fixed on a
nocturnal sceneon the full moon high in the skyon the overthrow
of the great idol and a glittering army among the marble ruins of the
Serapeum Apostles and martyrs soared around the Saviour sat enthroned
in glory and triumph while angels cradled on the clouds that were his
footstool were singing beatific hymns which sounded clearly in her ear
above the manyvoiced tumult of the quays The vision did not vanish
till she was desired to get into the boat
Herse was a native of Alexandria and Karnis had passed some of the best
years of his life there but to Orpheus and Agne all was new and even
the girl when once she had escaped from the crowd and noise which
oppressed her took an interest in the scene and asked a question now
and then The younger man had not eyes enough to see all that claimed
his attention and admiration
There were the great sluicegates at the entrance to the canal that
joined the lake to the seathere in a separate dock lay the splendid
imperial Nileboats which served to keep up communication between the
garrison of Alexandria and the military stations on the riverthere
again were the gaudy barges intended for the use of the comes the
prefect and other high officialsand there merchantvessels of every
size lay at anchor in countless number Long trains of manycolored
sails swept over the rippling lake like flights of birds across a
cornfield and every inch of the shore was covered with stores or
buildings Far away to the south long trellices of vine covered the
slopes broken by the silvery glaucous tones of the olivegroves and
by clumps of towering palms whose crowns mingled to form a lofty canopy
White walls gaudilypainted temples and private villas gleamed among
the green and the slanting rays of the low sun shining on the drops
that fell from the neverresting wheels and buckets that irrigated the
land turned them into showers of diamonds These waterworks of the
most ingenious construction many of them invented and contrived by
scientific engineers were the weapons with which man had conquered
the desert that originally surrounded this lake forcing it into green
fertility and productiveness of grain and fruit Nay the desert had
for many centuries here ceased to exist Dionysus the generous and the
kindly gardengods had blest the toil of men and yet now in many
a plotin all which belonged to Christian ownerstheir altars lay
scattered and overthrown
During the last thirty years much indeed was changed and nothing to
the satisfaction of old Karnis Herse too shook her head and when
the rowers had pulled them about halfway across she pointed to a broad
vacant spot on the bank where a new building was just rising above the
soil and said sadly to her husband
Would you know that place again Where is our dear old temple gone The
temple of Dionysus Karnis started up so hastily that he almost upset
the boat and their conductor was obliged to insist on his keeping
quiet he obeyed but badly however for his arms were never still as he
broke out
