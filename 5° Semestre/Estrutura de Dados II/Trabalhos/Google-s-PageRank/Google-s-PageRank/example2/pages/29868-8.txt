LOVE AND LUCY
CHAPTER I
ONSLOW SQUARE
This is a romantic tale So romantic is it that I shall be forced to
pry into the coy recesses of the mind in order to exhibit a connected
reasonable affair not only of a man and his wife prosperously seated
in the mean of things nel mezzo del cammin in space as well as
timefor the Macartneys belonged to the middle class and were well
on to the middle of life themselves but of stript quivering and
winged souls tiptoe within them tiptoe for flight into diviner spaces
than any seemly bodies can afford them As you peruse you may find it
difficult to believe that Macartney himselfJames Adolphus that
remarkable solicitorcould have possessed a quivering winged soul
fit to be stript and have hidden it so deep But he did though and
the inference is that everybody does As for the lady that is not so
hard of belief It very seldom iswith women They sit so much at
windows that pretty soon their eyes become windows themselvesout of
which the soul looks darkling but preening out of which it sometimes
launches itself into the deep wooed thereto or not by aubade or
serena But a man with his vanity haunting him pulls the blinds
down or shuts the shutters to have it decently to himself and his
lookingglass and you are not to know what storm is enacting deeply
within Finally I wish once for all to protest against the fallacy
that piracy brigandage pearlfishery and marooning are confined to
the wilder parts of the habitable globe Never was a greater if more
amiable delusion fostered to serve his simplicity by Lord Byron and
others Because a man wears trousers shall there be no more cakes and
ale Because a woman subscribes to the London Institution desires the
suffrage or presides at a Committee does the bocca baciata perde
ventura Believe me no There are at least two persons in each of
us one at least of which can course the starry spaces and inhabit
where the other could hardly breathe for ten minutes Such is my own
experience and such was the experience of the Macartney pairand now
I have done with exordial matter
The Macartneys had a dinnerparty on the twelfth of January There
were to be twelve people at it in spite of the promised assistance of
Lancelot at dessert which Lucy comforted herself by deciding would
only make twelve and a half not thirteen She told that to her
husband who fixed more firmly his eyeglass and grunted Im not
superstitious myself He may not have been but certainly Lucy told
herself he wasnt very good at little jokes Lancelot on the other
hand was very good at them Twelve and a half he said lifting one
eyebrow just like his father Why Im twelve and a half myself
Then he propounded his little joke I say Mamma on the twelve and
halfth of Januarybecause the evening is exactly half the daytwelve
and a half people have a dinnerparty and one of them is twelve and
a half Isnt that neat
Lucy encouraged her beloved Its very neat indeed she said and
her grey eyes glowed or seemed to glow
Its what we call an omen at school said Lancelot It meansoh
well it means lots of things like youre bound to have it and its
bound to be a frightful success or an utter failure or something of
that kind He thought about it Developments crowded upon him I
say Mamma all this was at breakfast Macartney shrouding himself
in the Morning Post
Yes Lancelot
It would be awfully good awfully ingenious and all that if one of
the people was twice twelve and a half
She agreed Yes I should like that Very likely one of them is
Lancelot looked extremely serious Not Mr Urquhart he said
No said Lucy I am sure Mr Urquhart is older than that But
theres Margery Dacre She might do
Lancelot had his own ideas as to whether women counted or not in
omens but was too polite to express them
Is she twentyfive do you think Shes rather thin Lucy exploded
and had to kiss the unconscious humourist Do you think we grow
fatter as we grow older Then you must think me immense because Im
much more than twentyfive she said
Here was a vital matter It is impossible to do justice to Lancelots
seriousness on the edge of truth How much more are you really
he asked her trembling for the answer
She looked heavenly pretty with her drawnback head and merry eyes
She was a darkhaired woman with a tender smile but her eyes were
her strong featureof an intensely bluegrey iris ringed with
black Poising to tantalise him adoring the fun of it suddenly she
melted leaned until her cheek touched his and whispered the dreadful
truthThirtyone
I wish I could do justice to his struggle politeness tussling with
pity for a fall but tripping it up and rising to the proper
lightness of touch Are you really thirtyone Oh well thats
nothing It was gallantly done She kissed him again and Lancelot
changed the subject
Theres Mr Lingen isnt there he asked adding Hes always
here
Much more than twentyfive said his mother very much aware of Mr
Lingens many appearances in Onslow Square She made one more attempt
at her husband wishing as she always did wish to draw him into the
company It was not too successful Lingen Oh a stripling he said
lightly and rustled the Morning Post like an aspen tree
Father always talks as if he was a hundred himself said Lancelot
who was not afraid of him He had to be content with Miss Dacre after
all The othersthe Judge and Lady Bliss Aunt Mabel and Uncle
Corbet the Worthingtons were out of the question As for Miss
Bacchusoh Miss Bacchus was at least five hundred said
Lancelot and wished to add up all the ages to see if they came to a
multiple of twelve and a half
Meanwhile Mr Macartney in his leisurely way had risen from the table
cigar in mouth had smoothed his hair before the glass on the
chimneypiece looked at his boots wriggled his toes in them with
gratifying results adjusted his coatcollar collected his letters in
a heap and left the room They saw no more of him Half an hour later
the front door shut upon him He had gone to his office or as he
always said Chambers
He was rather bleak and knew it reckoning it among his social
assets Reduced into a sentence it may be said of Macartney that the
Chief Good in his philosophy was to be and to seem successful
without effort What effort he may have made to conceal occasional
strenuous effort is neither here nor there The point is that at
fortytwo he found himself solidly and really successful The
husband of a very pretty wife the father of a delightful and healthy
son the bestdressed solicitor in London and therefore you may
fairly say in the world with an earned income of some three or four
thousand a year with money in the funds two houses and all the rest
of it a member of three very oldfashioned most uncomfortable and
absurdly exclusive clubsif this is not success what is And all got
smoothly without a crease of the forehead by means of an eyeglass a
cold manner and an impassivity which nothing foreign or domestic had
ever disturbed He had ability too and great industry but it was
characteristic of him to reckon these as nothing in the scales against
the eyeglass and the manner They were his by the grace of God but
the others he felt were his own additions and of the best These
sort of investments enabled a man to sleep they assured one of
completeness of effect Nevertheless he was a much more acute and
vigorousminded man than he chose to appear
He was a solicitor it is true and had once been called an attorney
by a client in a rage but he could afford to smile at that because he
was quite a peculiar sort of solicitor by no means everybodys
money Rather he was a luxury an appanage of the great His office
which he called Chambers as if it was an old house in the country
was in Cork Street his clients were landed gentry bankers peers and
sons of peers The superior clergy too he handled the affairs of a
Bishop of Lukesboro and those of no less than three Deans and
Chapters Tall dark and trenchant with a strong nose and chin and
clouded grey eyes a handsome man with a fine air of arrogant comfort
on him he stood well and you could not but see what good clothes he
woreto my taste I confess a little too good His legs were a
feature and great play was made by wits with his trousers He was
said to have two hundred pairs and to be aiming at three hundred and
sixtyfive Certainly they had an edge and must have been kept in
order like razors but the legend that they were stropped after every
days use is absurd They used to say that they would cut paper
easily and every kind of cheese except Parmesan
He wore an eyeglass which with the wry smile made necessary by its
use had the marked effect of intimidating his clients and driving
them into indiscretions admissions and intemperate discourse
Hypnotised by the unknown terrific of which the glitter of the blank
surface the writhen and antick smile were such formidable symbols
they thought that he knew all and provided that he should by telling
it him To these engines of mastery he had added a third He practised
laconics and carried them to the very breaking point He had in his
timeI repeat the talegone without his breakfast for three days
running rather than say that he preferred his egg poached His wife
had been preoccupied at the timeit had been just before Lancelot was
born barely a year after marriageand had not noticed that he left
cup and platter untouched She was very penitent afterwards as he had
intended she should be The egg was poachedand even so she was
afraid to ask him when the time was ripe to boil it again It made her
miserable but he never spoke of it Of course all that was old
history She was hardened by this time but still dreadfully conscious
of his comforts or possible discomforts
This was the manner of the man who you may say had quizzed or
mesmerised Lucy Meade into marriage She had been scarcely eighteen
I believe that she was just seventeen and a half when he presented
himself the second of three pretty darkhaired and greyeyed girls
the slimmest and as I think by far the prettiest The Meades lived
at Drem House which is practically within Bushey Park Here the girls
saw much society for the old Meades were hospitable and the Mother
Meade a Scotchwoman had a great idea of establishing her daughters
The sons she left to Father Meade and his competent moneybags Here
then James Adolphus Macartney presented himself and here sat smiling
bleakly glaring through his glass one eyebrow raised to enclose it
safelyand waited for her to give herself away Swaying beneath that
shining disk she did it infallibly and he heard her out at leisure
and accepted her
Thats poetry of course Really it came near to that He had said to
her at a gardenparty in his easiest airiest manner You cant help
knowing that I am in love with you Now dont you think that we
should be a happy couple I do What do you say Lucy Shall we have a
shot He had taken her handthey were alone under a cedar treeand
she had not known how to take it away She was then kissed and had
lost any opportunity there might have been That was what really
happened and as she told her sister Mabel some time afterwards when
the engagement had been made public and there could be no question of
going back You know Mabel he seemed to expect it and I couldnt
help feeling at the time that he was justified Mabel tossing her
head up had protested Oh my dear nobody knows whether he was
justified but yourself and Lucy No of course not The
question Mabel went on is whether you encouraged him or not Lucy
was clear about that No not the least in the world Heencouraged
himself I felt that I simply had to do something
I suspect that that is perfectly true I am sure that he did just as I
said he always did and bluffed her into marriage with an eyeglass and
smile awry Whether or no he bluffed himself into it too tempted by
the power of his magic apparatus is precisely the matter which I am
to determine It may have been sobut anyhow the facts show you how
successful he was in doing what had to be done Cosa fatta capo ha
as the proverb says The thing done whether wisely or not was
smoothly done Everything was of a piece with that He pulled off
whatever he tried for without any apparent effort People used to say
that he was like a river smoothly flowing very deep rippling
constant in mutability husbanding and guiding his eddies Its not a
bad figure of him He liked it himself and smiled more askew and
peered more blandly when he heard it
Small things betray men Here is one His signature was invariably in
full Yours very truly James Adolphus Macartney It was as if he
knew that Adolphus was rather comic opera but wouldnt stoop to
disguise it Why bother He crowded it upon the Bishop upon the Dean
and Chapter of Mells upon old Lord Drake He said Why conceal the
fact that my sponsors made a faux pas There it is and have done
with it Such things have only to be faced to be seen as nothings
What are we reasonable beings
Now when Lucy Meade practically a child for all her sedateness and
serious eyes married him two things terrified her on the day One
was her husband and the other lest her friends should discover it
They never did and in time her panic wore off She fought it in the
watches of the night and in the glare of her lonely days Not a soul
not her mother not even Mabel knew her secret James never became
comic to her she never saw him a figure of fun but she was able to
treat him as a human being Lancelots arrival made all the
difference in the world to that matter as to all her other matters
for even Lucy herself could not help seeing how absurdly jealous James
was of his offspring For a time he was thrown clean out of the saddle
and as near falling in his own esteem as ever in life But he
recovered his balance and though he never regained his old
ascendency which had been that of a Juju he was able to feel
himself as he said Master in his own house with a very real
reserve of terrorismif it should be wanted The great thing
Macartney thought was discipline constant watchful discipline A
man must bend everything to that Women have to learn the virtue of
giving up as well as of giving Giving is easy any woman knows that
but giving up Let that be seen as a subtle a sublimated form of
giving and the lesson is learned But practice makes perfect You
must never relax the rein He never did There was all the ingenuity
and patience of a woman about him
By this time after twelve years and more of marriage they were very
good friends or why not say old acquaintances There are two kinds
of crystallisation in love affairs with all respect to M de
Stendhal One kind hardens the surfaces without any decorative
effect There are no facets visible no angles to catch the light In
the case of the Macartney marriage I suspect this to have been the
only kinda kind of callosity protective and numbing The less they
were thrown together she found the better friends they were At home
they were really no more than neighbours abroad she was Mrs
Macartney and never would dine out without him She was
oldfashioned her friends called her a prude But she was not at all
unhappy She liked to think of Lancelot she said and to be quiet
And really as Miss Bacchus a terrible old woman once said Lucy was
so little of a married woman that she was perfectly innocent
But she was oneandthirty and as sweet and pretty a woman as you
would wish to see She had the tender dragging smile of a Luini
Madonna grave twilight eyes full of compassionate understanding
very dark eyebrows very long lashes like the fringe of rain over a
moorland landscape She had a virginal shape and liked her clothes to
cling about her knees Long fingers longish thin feet But her
humorous sense was acute and very delightful and all children loved
her Such charms as these must have been as obvious to herself as they
were to everybody else She had a modest little court of her own
Francis Lingen was almost admittedly in love with her one of
Macartneys friends But she accepted her riches soberly and did not
fret that they must be so hoarded If by moments as she saw herself
or looked at herself in the glass a grain of bitterness surged up in
her throat that all this fair seeming could not be put out to
usury well she put it to herself very differently not at all in
words but in narrowed scrutinising eyes halfturns of the pretty
head a sigh and lips pressed together There had beennay there
wasLancelot her darling That was usufruct but usury was a
different thing There had never been what you would call or Miss
Bacchus would certainly call usury That indeed She would raise her
fine brows compress her lips and turn to her bed then put out the
light Lying awake very often she might hear James chain the front
door trumpet through his nose on the mat and slowly mount the stairs
to his own room She thought resolutely of Lancelot pursuing his
panting quests at school or of her garden in midJune or of the
gorse afire on Wycross Commonand so to sleep
A long chapter but you will know the Macartney pair by means of it
CHAPTER II
A DINNER PARTY
This was not to be one of Macartneys grand fulldress dinnerparties
the sort where you might have two lords and would be sure to have one
with his lady or a Cabinet Minister in a morningcoat and greenish
tie or a squire and squiress from Northumberland up for a month of
the season or the Dean of Mells No nor was it to be one which Lucy
had to give to her visitinglist and at which as Macartney rarely
failed to remark there was bound to be a clergyman and some lean
woman with strawcoloured hair interested in a Settlement It was to
be a particular kind of dinnerparty this one of which the first
object was to bring Urquhart in touch with Lingen It could have been
done at a club no doubt Macartney admitted it Yes I know I
knowhe used his most tired voice as if he had been combating the
suggestion all along You are perfectly right It mightif it had
not happened to be exactly what I didnt want Jimmy Urquhart is
rather a queer fish He is apt to shy off if one is not careful It
dont suit me to bring them together explicitly do you see I want
them to happen on each other They can do that better here than
anywhere Do you see
Lucy saw or saw enough She never enquired into Jamess law affairs
Shall I like Mr Urquhart do you think she asked him
The eyeglass focussed upon the cornice and glared at a fly which
found itself belated there Oh I think so Why not
Well you see I dont know why notor why I should Have I ever
seen him
James was bored No doubt you have Hes very much about
Yes said Lucy but I am not
James left the fly and fixed herapparently with horror Then he
looked at his boots and moved his toes up and down He looks like a
naval officer he said you instinctively seek the cuffs of his
coat Beefcoloured face blue eyes a squarejawed chap Yes you
might like him He might amuse you Hes a great liar Lucy thought
that she might like Mr Urquhart
On those lines the party was arranged the Blisses because we owe
them a dinner and I think the Judge will be amused by Jimmy the
Worthingtonsmakeweights but Shes a soft pink woman like a
Persian kitten
Does Mr Urquhart like that Lucy asked but James who didnt like
his jokes to be capped said drily I dont know
Then Lucys favourite sister Mabel was to be allowed because James
rather liked Corbet He thought him good style Now we wanted two
women One must be Miss Bacchushideous of course said James a
kind of crime but very smart He meant that she mixed with the
aristocracy which was true though nobody knew why The last was to
be Margery Dacre a very pretty girl Lucy put her forward and James
thought her over gazing out of window I like her name he saidso
Lucy knew that she was admitted
That was all The rest was her care and he washed his mind of it
very sure that she would see to it He wished the two men to meet for
a particular reason in a haphazard way because it was better to drift
Urquhart into a thing than to lead him up to it Moreover it was not
at all disagreeable to him that Urquhart a club and office
acquaintance should see how comfortably placed he was how well
appointed with wife and child with manservant and maidservant and
everything that was his Urquhart was a rich man and to know that his
lawyer was rich was no bad thing It inspired confidence Now the
particular thing to be done with the two men Francis Lingen and
Urquhart was this Francis Lingen who might be a baronet some day
and well to do was at the moment as at most moments hitherto very
short of money Urquhart always had plenty Macartneys idea was that
he might get Urquhart to fill Francis Lingens pockets on terms which
could easily be arranged There was ample security of course Francis
Lingen could have gone to the Jews or the bank but if the thing
could be done in a gentlemanly way through ones lawyer who also
happened to be a gentleman in ones own set and so onwell why
not
Hence the little dinner over whose setting forth Lucy puckered her
brows with Mrs Jenkins her admirable cook and wrote many notes on
little slips of paper which she kept for the purpose She knew quite
well when James was particular about a party He said less than
usual when he was particular Over this one he said practically
nothing So she toiled and made a success of it
The drawingroom looked charming and she herself in black over white
with her pearls the most charming thing in it It wanted a week of
Lancelots day for school he was to come in to dessertthat was
understood But the possible danger of a thirteenth was removed by
their being two tables of six each James had suddenly ordered this
variation of practicehe did not say whyand so it was to be
Crewdson the invaluable butlervalet of the house who presided over
a zenana of maids and seemed to carry his whiskers into the fray like
an oriflamme was visibly perturbed at this new notion Mr Macartney
has his reason we know But how is one gentlemans servant to split
himself in halves And where does he stand Mrs Jenkins With tables
dotted aboutlike a cafeor an archumpelygo He knew that it was
done in the highest places but he knew his own place best We are
not what you call the smart set he said We are not Park Lane or
Brook Street But we are solidthe professionsthe land and the
church No jinks in this house And small tables is jinks Not a
dinner but a kickup So Crewdson thought and so he looked but his
master was flint
Mabel came the first the lively and successful Mabel two years
younger than Lucyshe and Laurence he was Laurence Corbet Esq of
Peltry Park Wavertree and Roehampton SW a hunting man and
retired soldier as neatly groomed as a man may be He was jolly and
adored his Mabel He was county and approved by James Lucy used to
say of him that his smile could cure a toothache Lancelot pounced
upon the pair instantly and retired with them to the conservatory to
show off his orangetree whose pip had been plunged on his first
birthday But before long a suspicious sliding of the feet and a shout
from Corbet of Goal betrayed the orangetrees eclipse
Next plunged Miss Bacchus with her front hair and front teeth and
air of digging you in the ribs She explained that she made a point of
being early lest she should be taken for an actress and forestalled
Macartneys assurance that she never would bewhich annoyed him The
Worthingtonsshe like an autumn flowerbed and he pale and
sleekand Francis Lingen came in together Lingen a very elegant
pale pink and frail young man with a strawcoloured moustache who
bowed when he shook your hand as if he was going to kiss it but
remembered just in time that he was in England He lowered his voice
when he spoke to women and most of them liked it Lucy wasnt sure
whether she did or not It made her selfconscious and perverse at
once She found herself wondering a whether he was going to make
love to her b when he was going to begin and c how she might
best cut him out All this was bewildering made her feel stupid and
annoyed her But she really liked Francis Lingen and had been amused
to discover how much he was Francis in her private mind Certainly
he was very elegant He had an outside pocket to his dress coat and a
handkerchief which you could have plugged your tooth with
He had just said to Lucy Im so glad to see you Its more than a
week since we metand I want your advice when Crewdson like a
priest announced Sir Matthew and Lady Bliss The Judge and his dame
were before Lucythe lady had a motherly soul in crimson satin and
paste the gentleman square and solid like a pillarbox with a bald
head That is a pretty exact description of him The Judge was very
squareheaded very shiny and very plain but he was solid and he was
useful Macartney used to say that he had a face like a bad egg
Certainly he was curdledbut he shone and looked healthy
Lucy allowed herself to be mothered and in the meantime murmured the
Judges name and Miss Bacchuss
Everybody knows Miss Bacchus said the gallant man and Miss Bacchus
briskly rejoined More people know Tom Fool After that they got on
excellently Then she heard from the door Mr Urquhart and had time
to turn Francis Lingen over to Lady Bliss before she faced the ruddy
and blueeyed stranger Her first thought the only one she had time
for was What very blue eyes what a very white shirtfront when
she shook hands
How dye do You wont know who I am he said at once
Oh but I do she assured him James described you to me
He blinked Oh did he I suppose he told you I was a great liar
Jamess very words She nodded without speaking but laughter
flickered over her face like summer lightning
Well said Urquhart I amto him Ive known Macartney for
yearslong before you did I like him but I think he gives himself
airs Now you cant you know when the man with you is a liar You
never know where to have a liar or whether you have him or not And
then you get in a fright whether hes not having you Macartney
saving your presence doesnt like being had
Lucy laughed and turned to wave her hand to Lancelot in the entry of
the conservatory
That your boy Urquhart asked But of course Hes like youwith
his fathers tricks That was perfectly true And thats your
sister of course Pretty woman Like you tooyou in a sunset
Perfect unconsciousness robbed this open commentary of sting
Upon him drifted Mrs Worthington like a peony in the tideway
Urquhart bowed Your servant maam
She cried Hullo Jimmy you here
Where else
Why I thought you were in Switzerland
So I was he said All among the curates But I came backbecause
they didnt He turned to Lucy And because I was asked here
She asked him Were you skiing Lancelot will grudge you that
He told her I was not No lonely death for me I was bobbing it You
are swept off by dozens at a time thereby fifties in a cave Its
more cheerful Then he seemed to remark something which he thought
she ought to know Jimmy You heard her Now Macartney and I are both
called James But who ever made a Jimmy of him She was annoyed with
himthe man seemed to suppose she could be pleased by crabbing
Jamesand glad of Margery Dacre a mermaid in seagreen who swam in
with apologiesdue to Macartneys abhorrent eyeglass upon her And
then they all went in to their archumpelygo where Crewdson and his
ladies were waiting for them rari nautes
Lucys tableshe was between the Judge and Urquhart and had Mabel
Worthington and Miss Bacchus before herat once took the mastery
Urquhart fixed Crewdson with his eye and thenceforward commanded
him Jamess eyeglass speechless with horror over Lady Blisss
shoulder glared like a frosty moon
Miss Bacchus it seems was his old acquaintance She too called him
Jimmy and drove at him with vigour He charged her not to rally him
and being between the two sisters talked to both of them at once or
rather started them off as a musichall singer starts the gallery
and then let them go on over his head
They talked of Wycross Lucys house in the country compared it with
Peltry which Mabel deprecated as a barrack and came to hear of
Urquharts house in the New Forest It was called Martley Thicket
Urquhart said it was a good sort of place Ive made an immense
lake he said with his eyes so very wide that Miss Bacchus said
Youre making two now He described Martley and the immense lake
House stands high in beech woods but is cut out to the south It
heads a valleylawns on three sides smooth as billiard tablesthen
the lake with a marble lipand stepsbroad and low steps in flights
of eight Very good you know You shall see it
Lucy wanted to know How big was the lake really
Urquhart said It looked a milebut thats the art of the thing
Really its two hundred and fifty yards Much better than a jab in
the eye with a blunt stick I did it by drainage and a dam Took a
year to get the water up When a hunted stag took to it and swam
across I felt that Id done something Fishing I should think so
And a bathinghouse in a wooded cornerin a canebrake of bamboos
Youll like it
Miss Bacchus said I dont believe a word of it but he seemed not
to hear her
When will you come and see it he asked Lucy
She agreed that see it she must if only to settle whether it existed
or not You see that Miss Bacchus has no doubts
Urquhart said She never hasabout anything She is fixed in
certainty like a bee in amber A dull life
Bless you Jimmy she said I thrive on itand youll never
thrive
Pooh said Urquhart what you call thriving I call degradation
What you snuggle in there out of the draughtsand then somebody
comes along and rubs you and picks up bits of paper with you His
good spirits made the thing goand Jamess eyeglass prevailed not
against it
But Urquharts real triumph was at dessertLancelot sedately by his
mother between her and the Judge who briskly made way for him
Lancelot in his Eton jacket took on an air of precocious meditative
wisdom infinitely diverting to a man who reflects upon boysand no
doubt infinitely provocative
His coming broke up the talk and made one of those momentous pauses
which are sometimes paralysing to a table This one was so and even
threatened the neighbouring island Upon it broke the voice of
Urquhart talking to Mabel Corbet
