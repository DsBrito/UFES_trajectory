The First South Carolina on the other hand contained scarcely a
freeman had not one mulatto in ten and a far smaller proportion who
could read or write when enlisted The only contemporary regiment of a
similar character was the First Kansas Colored which began recruiting
a little earlier though it was not mustered in the usual basis of
military seniority till later See Appendix These were the only
colored regiments recruited during the year 1862 The Second South
Carolina and the FiftyFourth Massachusetts followed early in 1863
This is the way in which I came to the command of this regiment One
day in November 1862 I was sitting at dinner with my lieutenants
John Goodell and Luther Bigelow in the barracks of the FiftyFirst
Massachusetts Colonel Sprague when the following letter was put into
my hands
BEAUFORT S C November 5 1862
MY DEAR SIR
I am organizing the First Regiment of South Carolina Volunteers with
every prospect of success Your name has been spoken of in connection
with the command of this regiment by some friends in whose judgment I
have confidence I take great pleasure in offering you the position of
Colonel in it and hope that you may be induced to accept I shall not
fill the place until I hear from you or sufficient time shall have
passed for me to receive your reply Should you accept I enclose a
pass for Port Royal of which I trust you will feel disposed to avail
yourself at once I am with sincere regard yours truly
R SAXTON BrigGenl Mil Gov
Had an invitation reached me to take command of a regiment of Kalmuck
Tartars it could hardly have been more unexpected I had always
looked for the arming of the blacks and had always felt a wish to be
associated with them had read the scanty accounts of General Hunters
abortive regiment and had heard rumors of General Saxtons renewed
efforts But the prevalent tone of public sentiment was still opposed to
any such attempts the government kept very shy of the experiment and
it did not seem possible that the time had come when it could be fairly
tried
For myself I was at the head of a fine company of my own raising and
in a regiment to which I was already much attached It did not seem
desirable to exchange a certainty for an uncertainty for who knew but
General Saxton might yet be thwarted in his efforts by the proslavery
influence that had still so much weight at headquarters It would be
intolerable to go out to South Carolina and find myself after all at
the head of a mere plantationguard or a dayschool in uniform
I therefore obtained from the War Department through Governor Andrew
permission to go and report to General Saxton without at once resigning
my captaincy Fortunately it took but a few days in South Carolina to
make it clear that all was right and the return steamer took back a
resignation of a Massachusetts commission Thenceforth my lot was cast
altogether with the black troops except when regiments or detachments
of white soldiers were also under my command during the two years
following
These details would not be worth mentioning except as they show this
fact that I did not seek the command of colored troops but it sought
me And this fact again is only important to my story for this reason
that under these circumstances I naturally viewed the new recruits
rather as subjects for discipline than for philanthropy I had been
expecting a war for six years ever since the Kansas troubles and my
mind had dwelt on military matters more or less during all that time
The best Massachusetts regiments already exhibited a high standard of
drill and discipline and unless these men could be brought tolerably
near that standard the fact of their extreme blackness would afford me
even as a philanthropist no satisfaction Fortunately I felt perfect
confidence that they could be so trained having happily known by
experience the qualities of their race and knowing also that they had
home and household and freedom to fight for besides that abstraction
of the Union Trouble might perhaps be expected from white officials
though this turned out far less than might have been feared but there
was no trouble to come from the men I thought and none ever came On
the other hand it was a vast experiment of indirect philanthropy and
one on which the result of the war and the destiny of the negro race
might rest and this was enough to tax all ones powers I had been an
abolitionist too long and had known and loved John Brown too well not
to feel a thrill of joy at last on finding myself in the position where
he only wished to be
In view of all this it was clear that good discipline must come first
after that of course the men must be helped and elevated in all ways
as much as possible
Of discipline there was great need that is of order and regular
instruction Some of the men had already been under fire but they were
very ignorant of drill and camp duty The officers being appointed from
a dozen different States and more than as many regiments infantry
cavalry artillery and engineers had all that diversity of methods
which so confused our army in those early days The first need
therefore was of an unbroken interval of training During this period
which fortunately lasted nearly two months I rarely left the camp and
got occasional leisure moments for a fragmentary journal to send home
recording the many odd or novel aspects of the new experience Camplife
was a wonderfully strange sensation to almost all volunteer officers
and mine lay among eight hundred men suddenly transformed from slaves
into soldiers and representing a race affectionate enthusiastic
grotesque and dramatic beyond all others Being such they naturally
gave material for description There is nothing like a diary for
freshness at least so I think and I shall keep to the diary through
the days of camplife and throw the later experience into another form
Indeed that matter takes care of itself diaries and letterwriting
stop when fieldservice begins
I am under pretty heavy bonds to tell the truth and only the truth for
those who look back to the newspaper correspondence of that period
will see that this particular regiment lived for months in a glare of
publicity such as tests any regiment severely and certainly prevents
all subsequent romancing in its historian As the scene of the only
effort on the Atlantic coast to arm the negro our camp attracted a
continuous stream of visitors military and civil A battalion of black
soldiers a spectacle since so common seemed then the most daring of
innovations and the whole demeanor of this particular regiment was
watched with microscopic scrutiny by friends and foes I felt sometimes
as if we were a plant trying to take root but constantly pulled up to
see if we were growing The slightest camp incidents sometimes came
back to us magnified and distorted in letters of anxious inquiry from
remote parts of the Union It was no pleasant thing to live under such
constant surveillance but it guaranteed the honesty of any success
while fearfully multiplying the penalties had there been a failure
A single mutiny such as has happened in the infancy of a hundred
regiments a single miniature Bull Run a stampede of desertions and it
would have been all over with us the party of distrust would have got
the upper hand and there might not have been during the whole contest
another effort to arm the negro
I may now proceed without farther preparation to the Diary
Chapter 2 Camp Diary
CAMP SAXTON near Beaufort S C November 24 1862
Yesterday afternoon we were steaming over a summer sea the deck level
as a parlorfloor no land in sight no sail until at last appeared one
lighthouse said to be Cape Romaine and then a line of trees and
two distant vessels and nothing more The sun set a great illuminated
bubble submerged in one vast bank of rosy suffusion it grew dark
after tea all were on deck the people sang hymns then the moon set
a moon two days old a curved pencil of light reclining backwards on a
radiant couch which seemed to rise from the waves to receive it it sank
slowly and the last tip wavered and went down like the mast of a vessel
of the skies Towards morning the boat stopped and when I came on deck
before six
The watchlights glittered on the land
The shiplights on the sea
Hilton Head lay on one side the gunboats on the other all that was raw
and bare in the low buildings of the new settlement was softened into
picturesqueness by the early light Stars were still overhead gulls
wheeled and shrieked and the broad river rippled duskily towards
Beaufort
The shores were low and wooded like any New England shore there were a
few gunboats twenty schooners and some steamers among them the famous
Planter which Robert Small the slave presented to the nation The
riverbanks were soft and graceful though low and as we steamed up to
Beaufort on the floodtide this morning it seemed almost as fair as
the smooth and lovely canals which Stedman traversed to meet his negro
soldiers in Surinam The air was cool as at home yet the foliage seemed
green glimpses of stiff tropical vegetation appeared along the banks
with great clumps of shrubs whose pale seedvessels looked like tardy
blossoms Then we saw on a picturesque point an old plantation with
stately magnolia avenue decaying house and tiny church amid the woods
reminding me of Virginia behind it stood a neat encampment of white
tents and there said my companion is your future regiment
Three miles farther brought us to the pretty town of Beaufort with its
stately houses amid Southern foliage Reporting to General Saxton I had
the luck to encounter a company of my destined command marched in to
be mustered into the United States service They were unarmed and all
looked as thoroughly black as the most faithful philanthropist could
desire there did not seem to be so much as a mulatto among them
Their coloring suited me all but the legs which were clad in a lively
scarlet as intolerable to my eyes as if I had been a turkey I saw them
mustered General Saxton talked to them a little in his direct manly
way they gave close attention though their faces looked impenetrable
Then I conversed with some of them The first to whom I spoke had been
wounded in a small expedition after lumber from which a party had just
returned and in which they had been under fire and had done very well
I said pointing to his lame arm
Did you think that was more than you bargained for my man
His answer came promptly and stoutly
I been atinking Masr dots jess what I went for
I thought this did well enough for my very first interchange of dialogue
with my recruits
November 27 1862
ThanksgivingDay it is the first moment I have had for writing during
these three days which have installed me into a new mode of life so
thoroughly that they seem three years Scarcely pausing in New York or
in Beaufort there seems to have been for me but one step from the
camp of a Massachusetts regiment to this and that step over leagues of
waves
It is a holiday wherever General Saxtons proclamation reaches The
chilly sunshine and the pale blue river seems like New England but
those alone The air is full of noisy drumming and of gunshots for the
prizeshooting is our great celebration of the day and the drumming is
chronic My young barbarians are all at play I look out from the broken
windows of this forlorn plantationhouse through avenues of great
liveoaks with their hard shining leaves and their branches hung with
a universal drapery of soft long moss like fringetrees struck with
grayness Below the sandy soil scantly covered with coarse grass
bristles with sharp palmettoes and aloes all the vegetation is stiff
shining semitropical with nothing soft or delicate in its texture
Numerous plantationbuildings totter around all slovenly and
unattractive while the interspaces are filled with all manner of wreck
and refuse pigs fowls dogs and omnipresent Ethiopian infancy All
this is the universal Southern panorama but five minutes walk beyond
the hovels and the liveoaks will bring one to something so unSouthern
that the whole Southern coast at this moment trembles at the suggestion
of such a thing the camp of a regiment of freed slaves
One adapts ones self so readily to new surroundings that already the
full zest of the novelty seems passing away from my perceptions and I
write these lines in an eager effort to retain all I can Already I am
growing used to the experience at first so novel of living among
five hundred men and scarce a white face to be seen of seeing them go
through all their daily processes eating frolicking talking just as
if they were white Each day at dressparade I stand with the customary
folding of the arms before a regimental line of countenances so black
that I can hardly tell whether the men stand steadily or not black is
every hand which moves in ready cadence as I vociferate Battalion
Shoulder arms nor is it till the line of white officers moves forward
as parade is dismissed that I am reminded that my own face is not the
color of coal
The first few days on duty with a new regiment must be devoted almost
wholly to tightening reins in this process one deals chiefly with the
officers and I have as yet had but little personal intercourse with the
men They concern me chiefly in bulk as so many consumers of rations
wearers of uniforms bearers of muskets But as the machine comes into
shape I am beginning to decipher the individual parts At first of
course they all looked just alike the variety comes afterwards and
they are just as distinguishable the officers say as so many whites
Most of them are wholly raw but there are many who have already been
for months in camp in the abortive Hunter Regiment yet in that
loose kind of way which like average militia training is a doubtful
advantage I notice that some companies too look darker than others
though all are purer African than I expected This is said to be partly
a geographical difference between the South Carolina and Florida men
When the Rebels evacuated this region they probably took with them the
houseservants including most of the mixed blood so that the residuum
seems very black But the men brought from Fernandina the other day
average lighter in complexion and look more intelligent and they
certainly take wonderfully to the drill
It needs but a few days to show the absurdity of distrusting the
military availability of these people They have quite as much average
comprehension as whites of the need of the thing as much courage I
doubt not as much previous knowledge of the gun and above all
a readiness of ear and of imitation which for purposes of drill
counterbalances any defect of mental training To learn the drill one
does not want a set of college professors one wants a squad of eager
active pliant schoolboys and the more childlike these pupils are the
better There is no trouble about the drill they will surpass whites
in that As to camplife they have little to sacrifice they are better
fed housed and clothed than ever in their lives before and they
appear to have few inconvenient vices They are simple docile and
affectionate almost to the point of absurdity The same men who stood
fire in open field with perfect coolness on the late expedition have
come to me blubbering in the most irresistibly ludicrous manner on being
transferred from one company in the regiment to another
In noticing the squaddrills I perceive that the men learn less
laboriously than whites that double double toil and trouble which
is the elementary vexation of the drillmaster that they more rarely
mistake their left for their right and are more grave and sedate while
under instruction The extremes of jollity and sobriety being greater
with them are less liable to be intermingled these companies can
be driven with a looser rein than my former one for they restrain
themselves but the moment they are dismissed from drill every tongue
is relaxed and every ivory tooth visible This morning I wandered about
where the different companies were targetshooting and their glee was
contagious Such exulting shouts of Ki ole man when some steady
old turkeyshooter brought his gun down for an instants aim and then
unerringly hit the mark and then when some unwary youth fired his
piece into the ground at halfcock such guffawing and delight such
rolling over and over on the grass such dances of ecstasy as made the
Ethiopian minstrelsy of the stage appear a feeble imitation
Evening Better still was a scene on which I stumbled tonight
Strolling in the cool moonlight I was attracted by a brilliant light
beneath the trees and cautiously approached it A circle of thirty or
forty soldiers sat around a roaring fire while one old uncle Cato by
name was narrating an interminable tale to the insatiable delight of
his audience I came up into the dusky background perceived only by a
few and he still continued It was a narrative dramatized to the
last degree of his adventures in escaping from his master to the Union
vessels and even I who have heard the stories of Harriet Tubman and
such wonderful slavecomedians never witnessed such a piece of
acting When I came upon the scene he had just come unexpectedly upon a
plantationhouse and putting a bold face upon it had walked up to the
door
Den I go up to de white man berry humble and say would he please gib
ole man a mouthful for eat
He say he must hab de valeration ob half a dollar
Den I look berry sorry and turn for go away
Den he say I might gib him dat hatchet I had
Den I say this in a tragic vein dat I must hab dat hatchet for
defend myself from de dogs
Immense applause and one appreciating auditor says chuckling Dat
was your arms ole man which brings down the house again
Den he say de Yankee pickets was near by and I must be very keerful
Den I say Good Lord Masr am dey
Words cannot express the complete dissimulation with which these accents
of terror were uttered this being precisely the piece of information he
wished to obtain
Then he narrated his devices to get into the house at night and obtain
some food how a dog flew at him how the whole household black and
white rose in pursuit how he scrambled under a hedge and over a high
fence etc all in a style of which Gough alone among orators can give
the faintest impression so thoroughly dramatized was every syllable
Then he described his reaching the riverside at last and trying to
decide whether certain vessels held friends or foes
Den I see guns on board and sure sartin he Union boat and I pop my
head up Den I beenatink think Seceshkey hab guns too and my head
go down again Den I hide in de bush till morning Den I open my bundle
and take ole white shut and tie him on ole pole and wave him and
ebry time de wind blow I beenatremble and drap down in de bushes
because being between two fires he doubted whether friend or foe would
see his signal first And so on with a succession of tricks beyond
Moliere of acts of caution foresight patient cunning which were
listened to with infinite gusto and perfect comprehension by every
listener
And all this to a bivouac of negro soldiers with the brilliant fire
lighting up their red trousers and gleaming from their shining black
faces eyes and teeth all white with tumultuous glee Overhead the
mighty limbs of a great liveoak with the weird moss swaying in the
smoke and the high moon gleaming faintly through
Yet tomorrow strangers will remark on the hopeless impenetrable
stupidity in the daylight faces of many of these very men the solid
mask under which Nature has concealed all this wealth of motherwit
This very comedian is one to whom one might point as he hoed lazily
in a cottonfield as a being the light of whose brain had utterly gone
out and this scene seems like coming by night upon some conclave
of black beetles and finding them engaged with greenroom and
footlights in enacting Poor Pillicoddy This is their university
every young Sambo before me as he turned over the sweet potatoes and
peanuts which were roasting in the ashes listened with reverence to
the wiles of the ancient Ulysses and meditated the same It is Natures
compensation oppression simply crushes the upper faculties of the head
and crowds everything into the perceptive organs Cato thou reasonest
well When I get into any serious scrape in an enemys country may I
be lucky enough to have you at my elbow to pull me out of it
The men seem to have enjoyed the novel event of ThanksgivingDay they
have had company and regimental prizeshootings a minimum of speeches
and a maximum of dinner Bill of fare two beefcattle and a thousand
oranges The oranges cost a cent apiece and the cattle were Secesh
bestowed by General Saxby as they all call him
December 1 1862
How absurd is the impression bequeathed by Slavery in regard to these
Southern blacks that they are sluggish and inefficient in labor Last
night after a hard days work our guns and the remainder of our tents
being just issued an order came from Beaufort that we should be ready
in the evening to unload a steamboats cargo of boards being some of
those captured by them a few weeks since and now assigned for their
use I wondered if the men would grumble at the nightwork but the
steamboat arrived by seven and it was bright moonlight when they went
at it Never have I beheld such a jolly scene of labor Tugging these
wet and heavy boards over a bridge of boats ashore then across the
slimy beach at low tide then up a steep bank and all in one great
uproar of merriment for two hours Running most of the time chattering
all the time snatching the boards from each others backs as if they
were some coveted treasure getting up eager rivalries between different
companies pouring great choruses of ridicule on the heads of all
shirkers they made the whole scene so enlivening that I gladly stayed
out in the moonlight for the whole time to watch it And all this
without any urging or any promised reward but simply as the most
natural way of doing the thing The steamboat captain declared that they
unloaded the ten thousand feet of boards quicker than any white gang
could have done it and they felt it so little that when later in the
night I reproached one whom I found sitting by a campfire cooking a
surreptitious opossum telling him that he ought to be asleep after such
a job of work he answered with the broadest grin O no Gunnel das
no work at all Gunnel dat only jess enough for stretch we
December 2 1862
I believe I have not yet enumerated the probable drawbacks to the
success of this regiment if any We are exposed to no direct annoyance
from the white regiments being out of their way and we have as yet no
discomforts or privations which we do not share with them I do not as
yet see the slightest obstacle in the nature of the blacks to making
them good soldiers but rather the contrary They take readily to
drill and do not object to discipline they are not especially dull
or inattentive they seem fully to understand the importance of the
contest and of their share in it They show no jealousy or suspicion
towards their officers
They do show these feelings however towards the Government itself and
no one can wonder Here lies the drawback to rapid recruiting Were
this a wholly new regiment it would have been full to overflowing I
am satisfied ere now The trouble is in the legacy of bitter distrust
bequeathed by the abortive regiment of General Hunter into which they
were driven like cattle kept for several months in camp and then
turned off without a shilling by order of the War Department The
formation of that regiment was on the whole a great injury to this
one and the men who came from it though the best soldiers we have in
other respects are the least sanguine and cheerful while those who
now refuse to enlist have a great influence in deterring others Our
soldiers are constantly twitted by their families and friends with their
prospect of risking their lives in the service and being paid nothing
and it is in vain that we read them the instructions of the Secretary
of War to General Saxton promising them the full pay of soldiers They
only half believe it
With what utter humiliation were we their officers obliged to confess
to them eighteen months afterwards that it was their distrust which
was wise and our faith in the pledges of the United States Government
which was foolishness
Another drawback is that some of the white soldiers delight in
frightening the women on the plantations with doleful tales of plans for
putting us in the front rank in all battles and such silly talkthe
object being perhaps to prevent our being employed on active service
at all All these considerations they feel precisely as white men
wouldno less no more and it is the comparative freedom from such
unfavorable influences which makes the Florida men seem more bold and
manly as they undoubtedly do Today General Saxton has returned from
Fernandina with seventysix recruits and the eagerness of the captains
to secure them was a sight to see Yet they cannot deny that some of the
very best men in the regiment are South Carolinians
December 3 18627 PM
What a life is this I lead It is a dark mild drizzling evening and
as the foggy air breeds sandflies so it calls out melodies and strange
antics from this mysterious race of grownup children with whom my lot
is cast All over the camp the lights glimmer in the tents and as I sit
at my desk in the open doorway there come mingled sounds of stir and
glee Boys laugh and shouta feeble flute stirs somewhere in some
tent not an officersa drum throbs far away in anotherwild
kildeerplover flit and wail above us like the haunting souls of dead
slavemastersand from a neighboring cookfire comes the monotonous
sound of that strange festival half powwow half prayermeeting
which they know only as a shout These fires are usually enclosed in
a little booth made neatly of palmleaves and covered in at top a
regular native African hut in short such as is pictured in books and
such as I once got up from dried palmleaves for a fair at home This
hut is now crammed with men singing at the top of their voices in
one of their quaint monotonous endless negroMethodist chants
with obscure syllables recurring constantly and slight variations
interwoven all accompanied with a regular drumming of the feet and
clapping of the hands like castanets Then the excitement spreads
inside and outside the enclosure men begin to quiver and dance others
join a circle forms winding monotonously round some one in the centre
some heel and toe tumultuously others merely tremble and stagger on
others stoop and rise others whirl others caper sideways all keep
steadily circling like dervishes spectators applaud special strokes of
skill my approach only enlivens the scene the circle enlarges
louder grows the singing rousing shouts of encouragement come in
half bacchanalian half devout Wake em brudder Stan up to em
brudderand still the ceaseless drumming and clapping in perfect
cadence goes steadily on Suddenly there comes a sort of snap and the
spell breaks amid general sighing and laughter And this not rarely and
occasionally but night after night while in other parts of the camp
the soberest prayers and exhortations are proceeding sedately
A simple and lovable people whose graces seem to come by nature and
whose vices by training Some of the best superintendents confirm the
first tales of innocence and Dr Zachos told me last night that on his
plantation a sequestered one they had absolutely no vices Nor have
these men of mine yet shown any worth mentioning since I took command
I have heard of no man intoxicated and there has been but one small
quarrel I suppose that scarcely a white regiment in the army shows
so little swearing Take the Progressive Friends and put them in red
trousers and I verily believe they would fill a guardhouse sooner
than these men If camp regulations are violated it seems to be usually
through heedlessness They love passionately three things besides their
spiritual incantations namely sugar home and tobacco This last
affection brings tears to their eyes almost when they speak of their
urgent need of pay they speak of their lastremembered quid as if it
were some deceased relative too early lost and to be mourned forever
As for sugar no white man can drink coffee after they have sweetened it
to their liking
I see that the pride which military life creates may cause the
plantation trickeries to diminish For instance these men make the most
admirable sentinels It is far harder to pass the camp lines at night
than in the camp from which I came and I have seen none of that
disposition to connive at the offences of members of ones own company
which is so troublesome among white soldiers Nor are they lazy either
about work or drill in all respects they seem better material for
soldiers than I had dared to hope
There is one company in particular all Florida men which I certainly
think the finestlooking company I ever saw white or black they range
admirably in size have remarkable erectness and ease of carriage and
really march splendidly Not a visitor but notices them yet they have
been under drill only a fortnight and a part only two days They have
all been slaves and very few are even mulattoes
December 4 1862
Dwelling in tents with Abraham Isaac and Jacob This condition
is certainly mineand with a multitude of patriarchs beside not to
mention Caesar and Pompey Hercules and Bacchus
A moving life tented at night this experience has been mine in civil
society if society be civil before the luxurious forest fires of
Maine and the Adirondack or upon the lonely prairies of Kansas But a
stationary tent life deliberately going to housekeeping under canvas I
have never had before though in our barrack life at Camp Wool I often
wished for it
The accommodations here are about as liberal as my quarters there
two walltents being placed end to end for office and bedroom and
separated at will by a fly of canvas There is a good board floor and
mopboard effectually excluding dampness and draughts and everything
but sand which on windy days penetrates everywhere The office
furniture consists of a good desk or secretary a very clumsy and
disastrous settee and a remarkable chair The desk is a bequest of the
slaveholders and the settee of the slaves being ecclesiastical in its
origin and appertaining to the little old church or praisehouse
now used for commissary purposes The chair is a composite structure I
found a cane seat on a dustheap which a black sergeant combined with
two legs from a broken bedstead and two more from an oakbough I sit
on it with a pride of conscious invention mitigated by profound
insecurity Bedroom furniture a couch made of gunboxes covered with
condemned blankets another settee two pails a tin cup tin basin
we prize any tin or wooden ware as savages prize iron and a valise
regulation size Seriously considered nothing more appears needful
unless ambition might crave another chair for company and perhaps
something for a washstand higher than a settee
Today it rains hard and the wind quivers through the closed canvas
and makes one feel at sea All the talk of the camp outside is fused
into a cheerful and indistinguishable murmur pierced through at every
moment by the wail of the hovering plover Sometimes a face black or
white peers through the entrance with some message Since the light
readily penetrates though the rain cannot the tent conveys a feeling
of charmed security as if an invisible boundary checked the pattering
drops and held the moaning wind The front tent I share as yet with my
adjutant in the inner apartment I reign supreme bounded in a nutshell
with no bad dreams
In all pleasant weather the outer fly is open and men pass and
repass a chattering throng I think of Emersons Saadi As thou
sittest at thy door on the deserts yellow floorfor these bare
