Before the writer as he begins the pleasant task is an old
halfillegible map or rather fragment of a map Nearby are three or
four dull prints They are of a hundred years ago or thereabouts and
tell of a New York when President Monroe was in the White House and
Governor De Witt Clinton in the State Capitol at Albany and Mayor
Colden in the City Hall To pore over them is to achieve a certain
contentment of the soul Probably it held itself to be turbulent in
its daythat old New York Without doubt it had its squabbles its
turmoils its excitements We smile at the old townits limitations
its inconveniences its naivetes But perhaps in these years of
storm and stress and heartache we envy more than a little It is not
merely the architectural story that the old maps prints diaries tell
in them we can find an age that is gone catch fleeting glimpses of
people long since dust to dust look at past manners fashions
pleasures and contrast them with our own
But to begin with the old map The lettering beneath conveys the
information that it was prepared for the City in 18191820 by John
Randel Jr and that it shows the farms superimposed upon the
Commissioners map of 1811 Through the centre of the map there is a
line indicating Fifth Avenue north to Thirteenth Street Here and there
is a spot apparently intended to represent a farmhouse but that is all
for in 1820 though Greenwich Village and Chelsea were the city proper
was far to the south Some of the names on the old map are familiar and
some are not
Just above the bending lane that ran along the north side of Washington
Square then the Potters Field may be read Trustees of Sailors Snug
Harbor The land thus marked extends from what is now Waverly Place to
what is now Ninth Street In 1790 Captain Robert Richard Randall paid
five thousand pounds sterling for twentyone acres of good farming land
In 1801 he died and his will directed that a Snug Harbor for old
salts be built upon his farm the produce of which he believed would
forever furnish his pensioners with vegetables and cereal rations Later
Randalls trustees leased the farm in building lots and placed Snug
Harbor in Staten Island Above the estate in diagonal form and at one
point crossing Fifth Avenue to the west was the large farm of Henry
Brevoort More limited holdings in the names of Gideon Tucker William
Hamilton and John Morse separate in the map the Brevoort property
from the estates of John Mann Jr and Mary Mann The latter must have
been a landowner of some importance in her day for the fragment of a
chart runs into the margin above the line of Thirteenth Street without
indicating the beginning of any other ownership
On the land to the west of the Avenue line may be read Heirs of John
Rogers William W Gilbert Nicholson the Christian name lies
somewhere beyond the map horizon and Heirs of Henry Spingler
Irrigation is indicated by a line running in a general northwesterly
direction bearing the name Manetta Water while a thinner line
joining the first line from the northeast is described as East Branch
of Manetta Water Manetta Water was the English name The Dutch had
called it Bestavaers Rivulet It was a sparkling stream beloved of
trout fishermen rising in the high ground above Twentyfirst Street
flowing southeasterly to Fifth Avenue at Ninth Street then on to midway
between the present Eighth Street and Waverly Place where it swung
southwesterly and emptied into the Hudson River near Charlton Street It
ran between sandhills sometimes rising to the height of a hundred feet
and marked the course of a famous Indian hunting ground
The joy of the Izaak Waltons of the past is occasionally the despair of
the Fifth Avenue householders of the present Flooded cellars and
weakened foundations may be traced to the purling waters of the
sparkling stream But perhaps the trout were jumping Then the last
fisherman probably worried very little about the annoyances to which his
descendants were to be subjected In much the same spirit we are saying
today What will it all matter a hundred years hence
Beginning at the Potters Field the line of what is now Fifth Avenue
left the Road over the Sandhills or the Zantberg of the Dutch later
known as Art Street long since gone from the map and crossed the
Robert Richard Randall Estate Thence it ran through the Henry Brevoort
farm which originally extended from Ninth to Eighteenth Streets and
which had been bought in 1714 for four hundred pounds Crossing the
tributary stream at Twelfth Street it passed a small pond between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Streets and then ran on over low and level
ground to Twentyfirst Street then called Loves Lane To the right
was the swamp and marsh that afterwards became Union Square Following
the trail farther the hardy voyager wandered over hills and valleys
dales and fields through a countryside where trout mink otter and
muskrat swam in the brooks and pools brant black duck and yellowleg
splashed in the marshes and fox rabbit woodcock and partridge found
covert in the thicket Here and there was a farm but the city then
numbering one hundred thousand persons was far away Then in 1824 the
first stretch of the Avenue from Waverly Place to Thirteenth Street
was opened and the northward march of the great thoroughfare began Let
us try to picture the old town of that day the city that was still
under the shadow of the Knickerbockers
First at the southern extremity of the island was the Battery and
Battery Park When in The Story of a New York House the late HC
Bunner described the little square of green jutting into the waters of
the upper bay it was as it had been some years before the earliest
venturesome pioneers builded in lower Fifth Avenue From the pillared
balcony of his house on State Streetthe house may still be seenJacob
Dolph caught a glimpse of the morning sun that loved the Battery far
better than Pine Street where Dolphs office was It was a
poplarstudded Battery in those days and the tale tells how the wind
blew fresh off the bay and the waves beat up against the seawall and
a large brig with all sails set loomed conspicuous to the view and
two or three fat little boats catrigged after the good old New York
fashion were beating down towards Staten Island to hunt for the
earliest bluefish That was in 1808 and sixteen years later the
Battery with its gravelled shady paths and its somewhat irregular
plots of grass was still the citys favourite breathing spot There of
summer evenings after the stately walk down Broadway the crinolined
ladies and the beaux with their bellcrowned hats gathered to watch the
sun set behind the low Jersey hills and perhaps to inspect the review
of the Tompkins Blues or the Pulaski Cadets There was fierce rivalry
between these two commands one under Captain Vincent and the other
under Captain McArdle and each corps had its admiring sympathizers
Both Blues and Cadets presented a fine martial appearance as they swung
across the Battery marching like veterans who had faced fire and would
not flinch Sure it was a flippant chronicler has recorded both had
an undisputed reputation for charging upon a wellloaded board with a
will that left no telltale vestige Very likely in the throng all
were not of New York There were doubtful strangers too looking with
yearning eyes out over the dancing waters of the blue bayswarthy
weatherbeaten men with huge earrings They called themselves
privateersmen But there were those who smiled at the word for
romance had it that there were still buccaneers in the Spanish Main
In many families that daily visit to the Battery was all the summer
change Mr Dayton in his Last Days of Knickerbocker Life informed
us that neither belle nor gallant lost caste by declining to participate
in the routine of watering place life simple and inexperienced as it
then was Yet there were summer resorts and they were patronized by the
best and most prominent citizens of the country The springs at Saratoga
had already been discovered and there were many New Yorkers who made
the then long and arduous trip
But nearer at hand was the Beach at Rockaway sung by the military
poet George P Morris and Coney Island At the latter resort
conditions were primitive Unheard were the blaring of bands and the
raucous cry of the HotDog man and the riot and roar of the rabble
Mr Blinker of O Henrys Brick Dust Row could not then have seen
his vision and found his light For there was no mass of vulgarians
wallowing in gross joys to be recognized as his brothers seeking the
ideal But he might have been as well pleased with the unpretentious
hotel at the waters edge where the urbanite could enjoy the cooling
ocean breezes and listen to the waves and dine upon broiled chicken
and succulent clams
The press of the third decade of the last century was highpriced and
vitriolic Of the morning papers now known to New Yorkers there was
none The Sun the first to appear began in 1833 But of the
afternoon journals there was the Evening Post perhaps even then
making virtue odious as a wit of many years later was to express it
and the Commercial Advertiser now the Globe the oldest of all
metropolitan journals Before the appearance of the Sun the morning
papers had been the Morning Courier and New York Enquirer the
Standard the Democratic Chronicle the Journal of Commerce the
New York Gazette and General Advertiser and the Mercantile
Advertiser and New York Advocate In the evening there were the Star
and the American besides the Post and Commercial Advertiser
These newspapers were mere appendages of party organs in the
narrowest and most restricted sense espousing blindly certain interests
or ideas expounding in long editorials the views of small groups of
politicians

Such were the cries according to the veracious account of Charles
Dickens who had paid his first visit to us a short time before that
greeted the ears of Martin Chuzzlewit upon his arrival in the gate city
of the western world That amiable caricature reflects what the English
novelist thought or pretended to think of the New York journalism of
the day Exaggeration of course the bad manners of a young genius of
the British lower middle classes But quite goodnaturedly today we
concede that beneath bad manners and exaggeration there was a foundation
of truth Into the making of Colonel Diver the editor of the Rowdy
Journal may have gone a little of old Noah of the Star or James
Watson Webb of the Courier and Enquirer or Colonel Stone of the
Commercial Cant you see those grim figures of an old world strutting
down Broadway glaring about belligerently and suspiciously Almost
every editor of that period had a theatre feud at one day or another On
the luckless mummer who had incurred his displeasure he poured out the
vials of his wrath He incited audiences to riot Against his brother
editors he hurled such epithets as loathsome and leprous slanderer and
libeller pestilential scoundrel polluted wretch foul jaws
common bandit prince of darkness turkey buzzard ghoul
Somehow in thinking of the old days I find it hard to reconcile those
men and women who lived under the Knickerbocker sway with their
newspapers It is pleasanter to dwell upon the old customs to picture
Mr Manhattan leaving the scurrilous sheet behind him when he departed
from his store or counting house and repairing with clean hands to the
wife of his bosom and his family somewhere in Greenwich Village or
Richmond Hill or Bond Street or the beginnings of Fifth Avenue
But to revert to the manners of the old town First of all there was the
business of getting married It was with an idea of permanency then and
the Knickerbocker wedding was in consequence a ceremony To it the
groom his bestman and the ushers went attired in blue coats brass
buttons high white satin stocks ruffledbosomed shirts figured satin
waistcoats silk stockings and pumps The New Yorkers tailor if his
pretensions to fashion were wellfounded was Elmendorf or Brundage or
Wheeler or Tryon and Derby his hatter St John and his bootmakers
Kimball and Rogers For the wedding ceremony the mans hair was tightly
frizzed by Maniort the leading hairdresser of the day He was the
proprietor of the Knickerbocker BarberShop at Broadway and Wall Street
and the town gossip Years later he was to enjoy the patronage of the
Third Napoleon in Paris as a reward for favours extended to the Prince
when the latter was an exile here There is little record of elaborate
prenuptial bachelor dinners in the style of modern New York What would
have been the use The gardens of the citys fashionable homes boasted
no extensive circular fountains or artificial fishponds into which the
bestman or the father of the bridetobe could be flung as an artistic
diversion As has been said it was something of a slow old world
lacking in many of the modern comforts
The robe of the bride was of white satin tinged with yellow the bodice
cut low in the neck and shoulders and ornamented with lace Over her
hair built up by Martell was flung the coronet of artificial orange
blossoms held by the blonde lace veil Then the satin boots and the
sixbutton gloves At the weddingsupper the brides cake rich and of
formidable proportions was the piece de resistance Also there was
substantial fare hams turkeys chicken and game besides fruits
candies and creams In place of the champagne of later days there were
Madeira Port and Sherry Round the table illuminated by wax candles
and astral lamps young and old gathered the women of a past generation
in stiff brocades powdered puffs and tortoiseshell combs From the
first to last the Fifth Avenue wedding of those days reflected the
patriarchal system that had not yet passed
It was not a matter of denomination but when the world was young the
pioneers of the Avenue did not smile on the way to worship The Sabbath
day still retained a good deal of the funereal aspect with which the New
England Puritans had invested it The city was silent save for the
tolling of the church bells At ten oclock in the morning at three in
the afternoon and again at seven at night the solemn processions of
men women and children clad in their Sunday best issued from the
homes and slowly wended their way to church When the congregation had
gathered and the service was about to begin heavy iron chains were
drawn tightly across the streets adjacent to the various places of
worship It was the hour for serious meditation No distracting noise
was to be allowed to fall upon those devout ears
Abram C Dayton in his Last Days of Knickerbocker Life left a
description of the service at the Dutch Reformed Church of that day He
told of the longdrawnout extemporaneous prayers the allusions to
benighted heathen to whited sepulchres to the lake which burns
with fire and brimstone Of instrumental accompaniment there was none
and free scope was both given and taken by the human voice divine Then
the sermon Men were strong in those days Clergymen had not become
affected with the throat troubles prevalent in later times No
hourglass or warning clock was displayed in the bleak spare edifice In
the exuberance of zeal often the end of the discourse came only with
utter physical exhaustion Then the passing of the plate an
eightstanza hymn closing with the vehemently shouted Doxology and the
concluding Benediction From that oldtime Sabbath day the affairs of
the world were rigidly excluded It was a day of rest not only for the
family but for the familys manservant and maidservant Saturday had
seen the preparation of the necessary food
Illustration THE WASHINGTON ARCH A SPLENDID SENTINEL GUARDING THE
APPROACH TO THE AVENUE BEYOND HOUSES DATING FROM THE THIRTIES OF THE
LAST CENTURY THAT MARK THE BEGINNING OF THE STRETCH OF TRADITION
On the Sabbath only cold collations were served Public opinion was a
stern master Woe betide the one rash enough to defy the established
conventions The physician on his rounds or the churchgoer too aged or
infirm to walk to the place of worship were the only ones permitted to
make use of a horse and carriage Now and then one of the godless would
slip away northward for a drive on some unfrequented road Detection
meant societys averted face and stern reprimand For an indefinite
period the sinner would be a subject of intercession at evening prayers
The weekday life was in keeping with the Knickerbocker Sabbath Home was
the family castle over which parental authority ruled with an iron
hand Hospitality was genuine and wholehearted but tempered by frugal
moderation Strict punctuality was demanded of every member of the
household The noon repast was the meal of the day At the stroke of
twelve old New York sat down to table In the home there was variety and
abundance but the dinner was served as one course Meats poultry
vegetables pies puddings fruits and sweets were crowded together on
the board This adherence to the midday meal must have been the weak
point in the armour in which the old order encased itself For there the
first breach was made New Yorkers returning from visits to Europe
hooted at the primitive noon repast of their youth At first what were
called the foreign airs of these wouldbe innovators were treated with
derision But they persisted and by slow stages three oclock became
the extra fashionable hour for dinner The old City Hotel was one of the
first public places to fall into line
The time was to come when a dining establishment second to none of its
day in social prestige and culinary excellence was to stand on a corner
of Fifth Avenue and Fourteenth Street But when those who dwelt on lower
Fifth Avenue were still pioneers dining out in public places meant a
long and venturesome journey to the southward The restaurants of that
timethey were more generally called eating houseswere almost all
established in the business portions of the city The midday dinner was
the meal on which they depended for their main support Then masculine
New York left its shop or its counting house hurried a block to the
right or a block to the left and fell greedily on the succulent
oyster the slice of rare roast beef or the sizzling English mutton
chop Conspicuous among the refectories of this type were the Auction
Hotel on Water Street near Wall the dining room of Clark and Brown
on Maiden Lane near Liberty Street one of the first of the socalled
English chophouses the United States Hotel which stood until a few
years ago at the corner of Water and Fulton Streets and which was the
chosen home of the captains of the whaling ships from New London
Nantucket New Bedford and Sag Harbor Downings on Broad Street
famed for its Saddle Rocks and Blue Points and its political patrons
and the basement on Park Row a few doors from the old Park Theatre
presided over by one Edward Windust This last was a rendezvous for
actors artists musicians newspapermenin short the Bohemian set of
that dayand its walls were covered with old playbills newspaper
clippings and portraits of tragedians and comedians of the past
But already a demand had been felt for viands of another nature
hospitality of another sort The womankind of the day was looking for an
occasional chance to break away from the monotonous if wholesome and
substantial table of the home Those stiff Knickerbockers knew it not
but the modern diningout New York was already in the making At first
the movement was ascribed to the European Continental element In New
York Delmonico and Guerin were the pioneers in the field The former
began in a little place of pine tables and rough wooden chairs on
William Street between Fulton and Ann The original equipment consisted
of a broad counter covered with white napkins twotine forks
buckhandled knives and earthenware plates and cups From such humble
beginnings grew the establishments that have subsequently carried the
name Francis Guerins first cafe was on Broadway between Pine and
Cedar Streets directly opposite the old City Hotel Another resort of
the same type was the Cafe des Mille Colonnes kept by the Italian
Palmo on the west side of Broadway near Duane Street It was
apparently on a scale lavish for those days Long mirrors on the walls
reflected in an endless vista the gilded columns that supported the
ceiling The fortune accumulated by Palmo in the restaurant was lost in
an attempt to introduce Italian opera into the United States Palmos
Opera House in Chamber Street between Centre Street and Broadway
later became Burtons Theatre
Until 1844 New York was guarded against crime by the old
Leatherheads This force patrolled the city by night or that part of
it known as the lamp district They were not watchmen by profession but
were recruited from the ranks of porters cartmen stevedores and
labourers They were distinguished by a firemans cap without front
hence the name Leatherhead an old camlet coat and a lantern They
had a wholesome respect for their skins and were inclined to keep out
of harms way seldom visiting the darker quarters of the city When
they bawled the hour all rogues in the vicinity were made aware of their
whereabouts Above Fourteenth Street the whole city was a neglected
region It was beyond the lamp district and in the dark
In no way to the mind of the present scribe can the contrast between
the life of the modern city and of the town of the days when Fifth
Avenue was in the making be better emphasized than by comparing the
conditions of travel It was in the year 1820 that John Stevens of
Hoboken who had become exasperated because people did not see the value
of railroads as he did resolved to prove at his own expense that the
method of travel urged by him was not a madmans scheme So on his own
estate on the Hoboken hill he built a little railway of narrow gauge and
a small locomotive Long enough had he been sneered at and called
maniac He put the locomotive on the track with cars behind it and ran
it with himself as a passenger to the amazement of those before whom
the demonstration was made So far as is known that was the first
locomotive to be built or run on a track in America But even with
Stevenss successful example years passed before steam travel assumed a
practical form
When the pioneer of Fifth Avenue wished to voyage far afield it was
toward the stagecoach as a means of transportation that his mind
turned for the stagecoach was the only way by which a large portion of
the population could accomplish overland journeys To go to Boston for
example the traveller from New York usually left by a steamboat that
took him to Providence in about twentythree hours and travelled the
remaining forty miles by coach Five hours was needed for the overland
journey and was considered amazing speed By the year 1832 the overland
trip between New York and Boston had been reduced to fortyone hours
But the passengers were not allowed to break the journey at a tavern
even for four or five hours of sleep as they had formerly done but
were carried forward night and day without intermission A fare of
eleven dollars was usually exacted for the trip
Even to go to one of the towns of Connecticut the shore towns of the
Boston Post Road was an undertaking that called for serious preliminary
study A New York paper now before the writer carries in its first
column an advertisement of a new steamer the Fairfield plying
between New York and Norwalk But in order to make use of its services
the traveller had to be at the pier at the foot of Market Street at six
oclock in the morning Upon the arrival at Norwalk stages were at hand
for the convenience of such of the passengers who wished to travel on
to Saugatuck Fairfield Bridgeport Stratford Milford and other
points The same column carried information for those who contemplated
voyaging to Newport or Providence Every Monday Wednesday and Friday
the steamboats Benjamin Franklin Capt ES Bunker and President
Capt RS Bunker left New York for those Rhode Island towns at five
oclock in the evening
The Post Road to Boston of those days differed much from the Boston Post
Road of the present especially in its first stages going northward from
