till their tongues ached  I took up my broom and went on sweeping and
they was so busy talking long words they didnt know the meaning of to
each other that they was arf choked with dust afore they noticed it
When they did notice it they left off using long words and the skipper
tried to hurt my feelings with a few short ones e knew
Its no good wasting your breath on im ses the boy  You might as
well talk to a beerbarrel
He went off dusting imself down with his little pocketankercher and
arter the skipper ad told me wot hed like to do only he was too sorry
for me to do it e went back to the ship to put on a clean collar and
went off for the evening
He always used to go off by hisself of a evening and I used to wonder
ow he passed the time  Then one night I found out
I had just come out of the Bears Head and stopped to look round afore
going back to the wharf when I see a couple o people standing on the
swingbridge saying Goodbye to each other  One of em was a man and
the other wasnt
Evening capn I ses as he came towards me and gave a little start
I didnt know you ad brought your missis up with you this trip
Evening Bill he ses very peaceful  Wot a lovely evening
Beeutiful I ses
So fresh ses the skipper sniffing in some of the air
Makes you feel quite young agin I ses
He didnt say nothing to that except to look at me out of the corner of
is eye and stepping on to the wharf had another look at the sky to
admire it and then went aboard his ship  If he ad only stood me a
pint and trusted me things might ha turned out different
Quite by chance I happened to be in the Bears Head a week arterwards
and quite by chance as I came out I saw the skipper saying Goodbye
on the bridge agin  He seemed to be put out about something and when I
said Wot a lovely evening it would be if only it wasnt raining ard
he said something about knocking my ead off
And you keep your nose out o my bisness he ses very fierce
Your bisness I ses  Wot bisness
Theres some people as might like to know that you leave the wharf to
look arter itself while youre sitting in a pub swilling gallons and
gallons o beer he ses in a nasty sort o way  Live and let live
thats my motter
I dont know wot youre talking about I ses but it dont matter
anyways  Ive got a clear conscience thats the main thing  Im as
open as the day and theres nothing about me that Id mind anybody
knowing  Wot a pity it is everybody cant say the same
I didnt see im saying Goodbye the next week or the week arter that
either but the third week arter just calling in at the Bears Head I
strolled on casuallike and got as far as the bottom of Tower Hill afore
I remembered myself  Turning the corner I amost fell over the skipper
wot was right in the fair way shaking ands with his ladyfriend under
the lamppost  Both of em started and I couldnt make up my mind which
gave me the most unpleasant look
Peepbo I ses cheerfullike
He stood making a gobbling noise at me like a turkey
Give me quite a start you did I ses  I didnt dream of you being
there
Get off he ses spluttering  Get off afore I tear you limb from
limb  Ow dare you follow me about and come spying round corners at me
Wot dye mean by it
I stood there with my arms folded acrost my chest as calm as a
cucumber  The other party stood there watching us and wot e could ave
seen in her I cant think  She was dressed more like a man than a
woman and it would have taken the good looks of twenty like her to ave
made one barmaid  I stood looking at er like a man in a dream
Well will you know me agin she ses in a nasty cracked sort of
voice
I could pick you out of a million I sesif I wanted to
Clear out ses the skipper  Clear out  And thank your stars theres
a lady present
Dont take no notice of im Captain Pratt ses the lady  Hes
beneath you  You only encourage people like that by taking notice of
em  Goodbye
She held out her and and while the skipper was shaking it I began to
walk back to the wharf  I adnt gorn far afore I heard im coming up
behind me and next moment e was walking alongside and saying things to
try and make me lose my temper
Ah its a pity your pore missis cant ear you I ses  I expect she
thinks you are stowed away in your bunk dreaming of er instead of
saying things about a face as dont belong to you
You mind your bisness he ses shouting  And not so much about my
missis  Dye hear  Wots it got to do with you  Who asked you to shove
your oar in
Youre quite mistook I ses very calm  Id no idea that there was
anything on as shouldnt be  I was never more surprised in my life  If
anybody ad told me I shouldnt ave believed em  I couldnt  Knowing
you and knowing ow respectable you ave always purtended to be and
also and likewise that you aint no chicken
I thought e was going to ave a fit  He opped about waving his arms
and stuttering and going on in such a silly way that I didnt like to be
seen with im  Twice he knocked my at off and arter telling him wot
would appen if e did it agin I walked off and left him
Even then e wasnt satisfied and arter coming on to the wharf and
following me up and down like a little dog he got in front of me and
told me some more things he ad thought of
If I catch you spying on me agin he ses youll wish youd never
been born
You get aboard and ave a quiet sleep I ses  Youre wandering in
your mind
The lady you saw me with he ses looking at me very fierce is a
friend o mine that I meet sometimes for the sake of her talk
Talk I ses staring at im  Talk  Wot cant one woman talk enough
for you  Is your missis dumb or wot
You dont understand he ses cocking up is nose at me  Shes a
interleckshal woman full of eddication and information  When my missis
talks she talks about the price o things and says she must ave more
money  Or else she talks about things Ive done or sometimes things I
avent done  Its all one to her  Theres no pleasure in that sort o
talk  It dont help a man
I never eard of any talk as did I ses
I dont suppose you did he ses sneeringlike  Now tonight fust
of all we talked about the House of Lords and whether it ought to be
allowed and arter that she gave me quite a little lecture on insecks
It dont seem proper to me I ses  I ave spoke to my wife about em
once or twice but I should no more think of talking about such things to
a single lady
He began to jump about agin as if Id bit im and he ad so much to say
about my ed and blocks of wood that I pretty near lost my temper  I
should ha lost it with some men but e was a very stiffbuilt chap and
as hard as nails
Beers your trouble he ses at last  Fust of all you put it down
and then it climbs up and soaks wot little brains youve got  Wot you
want is a kind friend to prevent you from getting it
I dont know wot it was but I ad a sort of sinking feeling inside as
e spoke and next evening when I saw im walk to the end of the jetty
with the officeboy and stand there talking to im with his and on his
shoulder it came on worse than ever  And I put two and two together
when the guvnor came up to me next day and arter talking about dooty
and ow easy it was to get nightwatchmen mentioned in a offand sort
of way that if I left the wharf at all between six and six I could stay
away altogether
I didnt answer im a word  I might ha told im that there was plenty
of people arter me ready to give me double the money but I knew he could
never get anybody to do their dooty by the wharf like I ad done so I
kept quiet  Its the way I treat my missis nowadays and it pays in the
old days I used to waste my breath answering er back
I wouldnt ha minded so much if it adnt ha been for that boy  He
used to pass me as e went off of a evening with a little sly smile on
is ugly little face and sometimes when I was standing at the gate hed
give a sniff or two and say that he could smell beer and he supposed it
came from the Bears Head
It was about three weeks arter the guvnor ad forgot imself and I was
standing by the gate one evening when I saw a woman coming along
carrying a big bag in her and  I adnt seen er afore and when she
stopped in front of me and smiled I was on my guard at once  I dont
smile at other people and I dont expect them to smile at me
At last she ses setting down er bag and giving me another smile
I thought I was never going to get ere
I coughed and backed inside a little bit on to my own ground  I didnt
want to ave that little beast of a officeboy spreading tales about me
Ive come up to ave a little fling she ses smiling away harder than
ever  My husband dont know Im ere  He thinks Im at ome
I think I went back pretty near three yards
I come up by train she ses nodding
Yes I ses very severe and wot about going back by it
Oh I shall go back by ship she ses  Wot time do you expect the
Eastern Monarch up
Well I ses ardly knowing wot to make of er she ought to be up
this tide but theres no reckoning on wot an old washtub with a engine
like a sewingmachine inside er will do
Oh indeed she ses leaving off smiling very sudden  Oh indeed
My husband might ave something to say about that
Your usband I ses
Captain Pratt she ses drawing erself up  Im Mrs Pratt  He left
yesterday morning and Ive come up ere by train to give im a little
surprise
You might ha knocked me down with a feather and I stood there staring
at her with my mouth open trying to think
Take care I ses at last  Take care as you dont give im too much
of a surprise
Wot do you mean she ses firing up
Nothing I ses  Nothing only Ive known usbands in my time as
didnt like being surprisedthats all  If you take my advice youll
go straight back home agin
Ill tell im wot you say she ses as soon as is ship comes in
Thats a woman all over the moment they get into a temper they want to
hurt somebody and I made up my mind at once that if anybody was going
to be urt it wasnt me  And besides I thought it might be for the
skippers goodin the long run
I broke it to her as gentle as I could  I didnt tell er much I just
gave her a few ints  Just enough to make her ask for more
And mind I ses I dont want to be brought into it  If you should
appen to take a fancy into your ed to wait behind a pile of empties
till the ship comes in and then slip out and foller your usband and
give im the little surprise you spoke of its nothing to do with me
I understand she ses biting her lip  Theres no need for im to
know that Ive been on the wharf at all
I gave er a smileI thought she deserved itbut she didnt smile
back  She was rather a nicelooking woman in the ordinary way but I
could easy see ow temper spoils a womans looks  She stood there giving
little shivers and looking as if she wanted to bite somebody
Ill go and hide now she ses
Not yet I ses  Youll ave to wait till that little blackbeetle in
the office as gorn Blackbeetle she ses staring
Officeboy I ses  Hed better not see you at all  Spose you go
off for a bit and come back when I whistle
Afore she could answer the boy came out of the office ready to go ome
He gave a little bit of a start when e saw me talking to a lady and
then e nips down sudden about a couple o yards away and begins to do
is bootlace up  It took im some time because he ad to undo it fust
but e finished it at last and arter a quick look at Mrs Pratt and one
at me that I could ha smacked his ed for e went off whistling and
showing is little cuffs
I stepped out into the road and watched im out o sight  Then I told
Mrs Pratt to pick up er bag and foller me
As it appened there was a big pile of empties in the corner of the
wareouse wall just opposite the Eastern Monarchs berth  It might ha
been made for the job and arter I ad tucked her away behind and given
er a box to sit on I picked up my broom and began to make up for lost
time
She sat there as quiet as a cat watching a mouseole and I was going on
with my work stopping every now and then to look and see whether the
Monarch was in sight when I appened to turn round and see the office
boy standing on the edge of the wharf with his back to the empties
looking down at the water  I nearly dropped my broom
Ullo I ses going up to im  I thought you ad gorn ome
I was going he ses with a nasty oily little smile and then it
struck me all of a sudden ow lonely it was for you all alone ere and I
come back to keep you company
He winked at something acrost the river as e spoke and I stood there
thinking my ardest wot was the best thing to be done  I couldnt get
Mrs Pratt away while e was there besides which I felt quite sartain
she wouldnt go  The only ope I ad was that hed get tired of spying
on me and go away before he found out she was iding on the wharf
I walked off in a unconcerned waynot too farand with one eye on im
and the other on where Mrs Pratt was iding went on with my work
Theres nothing like ard work when a man is worried and I was amost
forgetting my troubles when I looked up and saw the Monarch coming up
the river
She turned to come into er berth with the skipper shouting away on the
bridge and making as much fuss as if e was berthing a liner  I helped
to make er fast and the skipper arter e had ad a good look round to
see wot e could find fault with went below to clean imself
He was up agin in about ten minutes with a clean collar and a clean
face and a blue necktie that looked as though it ad got yeller
measles  Good temper e was in too and arter pulling the officeboys
ear gentle as e was passing he stopped for a moment to ave a word
with im
Bit late aint you he ses
Ive been keeping a eye on the watchman ses the boy  He works
better when e knows theres somebody watching im
Look ere I ses  You take yourself off Ive had about enough of
you  You take your little face ome and ask your mother to wipe its
nose  Strickly speaking youve no right to be on the wharf at all at
this time
Ive as much right as other people he ses giving me a wicked look
Ive got more right than some people praps
He stooped down deliberate and picking up a bit o coke from the eap
by the crane pitched it over at the empties
Stop that I ses shouting at im
What for e ses shying another piece  Why shouldnt I
Cos I wont ave it I ses  Dye hear  Stop it
I rushed at im as he sent another piece over and for the next two or
three minutes e was dodging me and chucking coke at the empties with
the fool of a skipper standing by laughing and two or three of the crew
leaning over the side and cheering im on
All right he ses at last dusting is hands together  Ive
finished  Theres no need to make such a fuss over a bit of coke
Youve wasted pretty near arf a underedweight I ses  Ive a good
mind to report you
Dont do that watchman he ses in a pitiful voice  Dont do that
Ere I tell you wot Ill do  Ill pick it all up agin
Afore I could move and or foot he ad shifted a couple o cases out of
is way and was in among the empties  I stood there dazedlike while two
bits o coke came flying back past my ed then I eard a loud whistle
and e came out agin with is eyes rolling and is mouth wide open
Wots the matter ses the skipper staring at im
IIIm sorry watchman ses that beast of a boy purtending e was
ardly able to speak  Id no idea
All right I ses very quick
Wots the matter ses the skipper agin and as e spoke it came over
me like a flash wot a false persition I was in and wot a nastytempered
man e could be when e liked
Why didnt you tell me youd got a ladyfriend there ses the boy
shaking his ed at me  Why I might ave hit er with a bit o coke
and never forgiven myself
Ladyfriend ses the skipper with a start  Oh Bill I am
surprised
My throat was so dry I couldnt ardly speak  Its my missis I ses
at last
Your missis ses the skipper  Woes she iding behind there for
Sheshes shy I ses  Always was all er life  She cant bear
other people  She likes to be alone with me
Oh watchman ses the boy  I wonder where you expect to go to
Missis my grandmother ses the skipper with a wink  Im going to
ave a peep
Stand back I ses pushing im off  I dont spy on you and I dont
want you to come spying on me  You get off  Dye hear me  Get off
We had a bit of a struggle till my foot slipped and while I was waving
my arms and trying to get my balance back e made a dash for the empties
Next moment he was roaring like a mad bull that ad sat down in a
sorsepan of boiling water and rushing back agin to kill me
I believe that if it adnt ha been for a couple o lightermen wot ad
just come on to the jetty from their skiff and two of his own ands
hed ha done it  Crazy with passion e was and it was all the four of
em could do to hold im  Every now and then hed get a yard nearer to
me and then theyd pull im back a couple o yards and beg of im to
listen to reason and ear wot I ad to say  And as soon as I started and
began to tell em about is ladyfriend he broke out worse than ever
People acrost the river must ha wondered wot was appening  There was
two lightermen two sailormen me and the skipper and Mrs Pratt all
talking at once and nobody listening but the officeboy  And in the
middle of it all the wicket was pushed open and the ed of the lady wot
all the trouble was about peeped in and drew back agin
There you are I ses shouting my ardest  There she is  Thats the
lady I was telling you about  Now then put em face to face and clear
my character  Dont let er escape
One o the lightermen let go o the skipper and went arter er and
just as I was giving the other three a helping and e came back with
er  Mrs Pratt caught er breath and as for the skipper e didnt
know where to look as the saying is  I just saw the lady give im one
quick look and then afore I could dream of wot was coming she rushes up
to me and flings er long bony arms round my neck
Why William she ses wots the matter  Why didnt you meet me
Didnt you get my letter  Or ave you ceased to care for me
Let go I ses struggling  Let go  Dye ear  Wot dye mean by it
Youve got old of the wrong one
Oh William she ses arf strangling me  Ow can you talk to me like
that  Wheres your art
I never knew a woman so strong  I dont suppose shed ever ad the
chance of getting er arms round a mans neck afore and she hung on to
me as if shed never let go  And all the time I was trying to explain
things to them over er shoulder I could see they didnt believe a word I
was saying  One o the lightermen said I was a wonder and the other
said I was a fair coughdrop Me
She got tired of it at last but by that time I was so done up I
couldnt say a word  I just dropped on to a box and sat there getting my
breath back while the skipper forgave is wife for er unjust suspicions
of imbut told er not to do it aginand the officeboy was saying Id
surprised even im  The last I saw of the ladyfriend the two
lightermen was helping er to walk to the gate and the two sailormen was
follering er up behind carrying er pocketankercher and upberella
