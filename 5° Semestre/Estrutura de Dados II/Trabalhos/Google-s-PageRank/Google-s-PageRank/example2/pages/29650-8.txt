THE GREATER POWER
CHAPTER I
OVERBURDENED
It was winter in the great coniferous forest which rolls about the
rocky hills and shrouds the lonely valleys of British Columbia A
bitter frost had dried the snow to powder and bound the frothing
rivers it had laid its icy grip upon the waters suddenly and the
sound of their turmoil died away in the depths of the rockwalled
canons until the rugged land lay wrapped in silence under a sky of
intense pitiless blueness that seemed frozen too Man and beast
shrink from the sudden cold snaps as they call them in that country
and the rancher who has sheep to lose sits shivering in his log
house through the long forenights with a Marlin rifle handy while the
famished timber wolves prowl about his clearing Still it is the
loggers toiling in the wilderness who feel the cold snaps most for
the man who labours under an Arctic frost must be generously fed or
the heat and strength die out of him and now and then it happens
that provisions become scanty when no canoe can be poled up the
rivers and the trails are blocked with snow
There were four loggers at work in a redwood forest one January
afternoon rolling a great log with peevies and handspikes out of a
chaos of fallen trunks The Bush a wall of sombre green spangled
here and there with frost and impressively still closed in about the
little gap they had made Not a sound came out of the shadowy avenues
between the tremendous colonnades of towering trunks and the topmost
sprays of the cedars and Douglas firs cut motionless against the blue
high above There was no wind and the mens breath went straight up
a thin white vapour into the biting air Still they were warm and
comparatively well fed which was a good deal to be thankful for and
three of them toiled contentedly with now and then a glance at their
companion who realized at length that he was beaten In fact it was
only by calling up all the resolution that was in him that this fourth
man Derrick Nasmyth had held himself to his task since early
morning for there is no occupation which demands from man more
muscular effort and physical courage than logging as it is generally
carried on in the forest of Western Canada
Nasmyth was a tall man apparently under thirty and leanly muscular
as were his companions for those who swing the axe from dawn to dusk
in that wilderness seldom put on flesh His bronzed face was also
lean and a trifle worn Considering his occupation it was perhaps
too finely chiselled and there was a certain elusive suggestion of
refinement in it He had clear blue eyes and the hair beneath his
battered fur cap was brown For the rest he wore a black leather
jacket with several rents in it ragged duck trousers and long boots
His companions were the usual Bush chopperssimple strongarmed men
of kindly natureand Nasmyth was quite aware that they had undertaken
most of his share in the work during the last few hours
Another heave said one of the woodsmen Hit her hard boys and
away she goes
They strained sinewy backs and splendid arms The great log rolled a
trifle farther canted as one of them slipped a handspike under the
butt of it and landed on the skids which were laid like railway
sleepers down the slope of a steep declivity The snow was ground down
and rammed back about the skids and the wornout hollow gleamed a
faint bluegrey in the shadow of the firs The men made another
strenuous effort as the log started but in another moment it rushed
away and like a toboggan sped downwards through the forest to the
riverice below The skids screamed beneath it the snow flew up like
smoke and then there was a thunderous crash and stillness again
Nasmyth gasped heavily and dropped his handspike
Boys he said Im used up Ill go along to the shanty and get my
time
He generally expressed himself much as his comrades did but now his
clean English intonation was a little more noticeable than usual One
of the others nodded sympathetically as he answered
Well I guess Ive seen the trouble trailing you for quite a while
Got to let up or play out Its one Ive been up against myself He
made a vague gesture A little rough on you
Then he and one of his comrades took up a big crosscut saw while the
other swung a gleaming axe Nasmyth walked back wearily through the
silent Bush towards the camp His back ached his head ached and he
felt a trifle dazed The strength seemed to have gone out of him and
he fancied that he was not very far from a physical collapse He was
glad when he reached the shanty where after he had shaken the snow
from his dilapidated boots he sat down by the glowing stove and
smiled wryly as he looked about him The shed was rudely built of
logs and a row of bunks packed with swampgrass and sprucetwigs
from some of which there hung portions of greasy blankets ran down
one side of it It smelt horribly of acrid tobacco and cookery but at
least it was warm which counted for much and during the last few
months Nasmyth had grown to look on it as home He knew also that
it would cost him something to leave it now especially as he had
nowhere else to go
Lying back listlessly in a lounge an ingenious chopper had made out
of a few branches and a couple of sacks Nasmyth vaguely recalled the
comfort of his London chambers and the great pillared smokingroom of
a certain exclusive club for he was a man acquainted with the
smoother side of life He had various gifts which were apparently of
no account in British Columbia and he had enjoyed an education that
had it seemed unfitted him for anything strictly utilitarian There
are a great many men of his description chopping trees and driving
cattle in Western Canada Indeed his story was one which with slight
variations may be heard frequently in that country Financial
disaster had overtaken his family Friends in high places had regarded
him coldly and he had been too proud to ask for favours or to profit
by those that were grudgingly offered him That was why he had gone
out to Canada and spent several years there earning his board and
now and then a few dollars as well by bodily labour until he went
up into the Bush with the loggers
For a time he had somehow contrived to hold his own with the other
workers though logging in heavy timber is one of the tasks one could
almost fancy that man was never meant for and the logger whose
overtaxed muscle fails him for a moment is very likely to have the
life crushed out of him by some ponderous slipping trunk Perhaps
his lack of endurance was due to the excessive strain or the
illcooked food but during the last few weeks he had been conscious
that a slackness was creeping over him Once or twice the handspike or
peevie had been torn from his grasp and the lives of his comrades had
been placed in peril He had found it more and more difficult to drag
himself out to his work each morning but he had held on until that
afternoon when his strength had suddenly failed him
Nasmyth was halfasleep when the cook and the leader of the gang came
in The latter who was a big gaunt man with grizzled hair stopped
close by the stove and looked at him
Well said the gang leader what do you figure youre doing here
Nasmyth explained with some difficulty for in the Bush men
acquire a certain pride in their physical manhood and it is never
a pleasant thing to own oneself defeated The logger however nodded
comprehendingly He was a reticent grimfaced person from Ontario
where they breed hard men though some have also kindly hearts in
them
Thats quite right Ive noticed it myself he commented In fact
Ive been figuring on asking you to get out the last week or two
Nasmyth smiled Like other men of his description in that country he
had become accustomed to hearing such remarks addressed to him
I wonder he answered reflectively why you didnt
The logger appeared to consider It was characteristic of him and the
stock he sprang from that he would never have admitted that he had
borne with Nasmyth as long as possible out of kindness The thing
would have hurt him
Well he said it seemed to me we might start you teaming if I
could have got a span or two of oxen in but Im most afraid I cant
get them at my figure He changed the subject abruptly Where are
you heading for
I dont quite know though I shall probably land in Victoria sooner
or later I might strike something a little easier than logging there
Still it would be most of a weeks march before I could reach the
railroad and theres not a ranch anywhere near the trail
The logger nodded Well he said Id head West instead Therell
be nothing going on along the railroad just now and the mines are
running easy while you ought to fetch the settlement south of Butte
Lake on the third day Guess you might pick up a dollar or two in that
neighbourhood and any way theres a steamer running down the West
Coast to Victoria Seems to me quite likely one of those Bushranchers
would take you in a while even if he didnt exactly want a hired man
but they dont do that kind of thing in the city
Nasmyth smiled Experience had already taught him that as a rule the
stranger who is welcomed in the cities arrives there with money in his
pockets and that it is the hardhanded men with the axes from whom
the wanderer in that country is most likely to receive a kindness
Still though he was naturally not aware of it a great deal was to
depend upon the fact that he followed the advice of the logger who
traced out a diagram on the bench upon which they sat
Theres an Indian trail up the river for the first four leagues said
the logger Then you strike southwest across the dividehereand you
come to the Butte River Shes running in a little canon and you cant
get over cept where a prospector or somebody has chopped a big fir
The log span across a stream is an old device and was probably
primitive mans first attempt at bridgebuilding though it is one
frequently adopted on the Pacific slope where a giant tree grows
conveniently close to an otherwise impassable river It was however
important that Nasmyth should be able to find the tree
You know exactly where that fir is he asked
Southwest of the highest ridge of the divide Once youre over
youll fetch the Butte Lake in a long days march When dyou figure
youll start
Tonight said Nasmyth after supper If theres sickness of any
kind hanging round meand I feel like ityou dont want me here
and I dare say theyd take me into the hospital at Victoria Walkings
easier than logging anyway and it seems wiser to try for that fir in
daylight
The logger nodded as if he concurred in this and taking a little
book from his pocket he turned it over wrinkling his brows while
Nasmyth watched him with a smile
Well he said at length well count you full time today but
theres the four days off when you got crushed by that redwood and
the week when you chopped your leg Then counting the amount for your
board thats thirtysix dollars Im due to you
Not quite answered Nasmyth There was the day or two after I fell
through the ice and had the shivers Id sooner you knocked off the
few dollars
The logger was said to be a hard man and in some respects this was
certainly the case but a faint flush crept into his grim face
Perhaps he had noticed the weariness in Nasmyths voice or the
hollowness of his cheeks
All right he said awkwardly Jake will put you up grub for four
days and well call it square
He counted out the money which Nasmyth slipped into the receptacle
inside his belt When the logger moved away the weary man crossed over
to his bunk Nasmyth had brought his few possessions up in a canoe
and now knowing that he could not take them all away he turned them
over with a curious smile There were one or two ragged pairs of duck
trousers stained with soil a few old tattered shirts and a jacket of
much the same description He remembered that he had once been
fastidious about his tailoring as he wondered when he would be able
to replace the things that he left behind Then he rolled up some of
the garments and his two blankets into a pack that could be strapped
upon his shoulders and as he did this his comrades came trooping
in stamping to shake the snow off their leggings
There were about a dozen of themsimple strenuous brownfaced
Bushranchers for the most partand they ate in haste voraciously
when the abundant but rudely served supper was laid out Nasmyth had
not much appetite and the greasy salt pork grindstone bread
desiccated apples flavoured molasses and flapjacks hot from the pan
did not tempt him He preferred to watch his companions and now and
then his glance was a trifle wistful He had worked and eaten with
them they had slept about him and he knew he had their rude
goodwill When his strength had begun to give way some of them had
saddled themselves with more than their share of the tasks they were
engaged in and he knew that it was possible he might not fall in with
comrades of their kind again Now that the time had come he who had
once been welcomed at brilliant London functions felt that it would
cost him an effort to part with these rough comrades Perhaps this was
not so astonishing for after all strenuous valiant manhood and
rude kindliness count for much
The shanty was cheerfully lighted and cosily warm Nasmyth had slept
soundly there on the springy sprucetwigs and there was at least
abundance when the mealtimes came round Now he was about to be cast
adrift again to face a three days march in the open under the bitter
frost and what might await him at the end of it he did not know At
length the meal was cleared away and when the pipes were lighted he
told his comrades that he was going They were not demonstrative in
their expressions of regret but they thrust upon him little plugs of
tobacco which could not well be replaced there and several of them
told him that if he struck nothing he liked better all he had to do
was to present himself at this ranch or the other beside blue lake or
frothing river when they went back in the spring What was more to the
purpose they meant it
Among those Western pines men are reared who in point of primitive
vigour slow endurance and the dogged courage that leads them to
attempt and usually to accomplish the apparently impossible are a
match for any in the world and no wanderer who limps up to their
lonely ranches is turned away Those who have no claim on them are
honoured with their hospitality and now and then one new to that
country looks with wonder on their handiwork Down all the long
Pacific coast from lonely Wrangel wrapped in the Northern snow to
Shasta in the South it is written on hewnback forest rent hillside
and dammed river The inhabitants are subduing savage Nature but as
time will surely show their greatest achievement is the rearing of
fearless men
Though it cost him an effort Nasmyth contrived to smile as he shook
hands with the loggers Then he set his lips tight as with his pack
strapped on his shoulders he opened the door and looked out at the
dimly shining snow It was only natural that he hesitated for a
moment After all brutal as the toil had been he at least knew what
he was leaving behind and his heart sank as he drew the door to The
cold struck through him to the bone though there was not a breath of
air astir and the stillness was almost overwhelming The frost
cramped his muscles and drove the courage out of him and as he
plodded down the trail he heard Jacques the FrenchCanadian cook
tuning his battered fiddle A little burst of laughter broke through
the twanging of the strings and Nasmyth closed one hand hard as he
strode on faster into the darkness There was as much of the animal in
him as there is in most of us and he longed for the cheerful light
and the warmth of the stove while one learns the value of human
companionship when the Frost King lays his grip on that lonely land
He was once more homelessan outcastand it was almost a relief to
him when at length the twanging of the fiddle was lost in the silence
of the pines
The trees rose about him towering high into the soft darkness in
serried ranks and the snow gleamed a cold bluegrey under them Not a
twig stirred the tall spires were black and motionless and solemn
and he felt that their stateliness emphasized his own feebleness and
inconsequence In the meanwhile though the snow was loose and
frostdried it was not much above his ankles and the trail was
comparatively good It seemed to him advisable to push on as fast as
possible for he had only four days provisions and he was not sure
of his strength There was no doubt as to what the result would be if
it failed him in the wilderness that lay between him and the
settlement
CHAPTER II
THE TRAIL
A halfmoon rose above the black tops of the pines and a faint light
which the snow flung back filtered down between the motionless
branches upon the narrow trail that wound sinuously in and out among
fallen trunks and thickets draped with withered fern for the Siwash
Indians passed that way when the salmon came up the rivers and the
path an Indian makes is never straight Over and over again an Indian
will go around an obstacle through which the Bushrancher would hew a
passage This is essentially characteristic of both for the primitive
peoples patiently fit their lives to their environment while the
white man grapples with unfavourable conditions and resolutely
endeavours to alter them
Until daylight Nasmyth made a tolerable pace He had been troubled
with a curious lassitude and an unpleasant dizziness but walking is
considerably easier than rolling ponderous logs and he knew that it
was advisable for him to push on as fast as possible At length the
dawn broke high up in a dingy grey sky and he stopped to build a
fire It did not take long to boil a can of strong green tea and to
prepare a piece of doughy bread with a little salt pork for his
breakfast Then he wrapped one of his blankets around him and took out
his pipe He did not remember how long he sat there but it was clear
daylight when he noticed that the fire was burning out and somewhat
to his annoyance he felt curiously reluctant to get up again
Though it cost him an effort he rose and stood a minute or two
shivering in the bitter wind which now set the dark firs sighing He
could see the trees roll upwards before him in sombre ranks until
their topmost sprays cut in a thin filigree very high up against the
sky and he knew that he must now leave the easy trail and cross the
big divide When he set out he was a little annoyed to find that the
packstraps hurt his shoulders and that one of his boots galled his
foot Kneeboots are not adapted for walking long distances but the
only other ones that Nasmyth possessed were so dilapidated that he had
left them behind
He went up for several hours through withered fern and matted
undergrowth and over horrible tangles of fallen treetrunks some of
which were raised high above the snow on giant splintered branches
The term virgin forest probably conveys very little to the average
Englishman since the woods with which he is acquainted are for the
most part cleaned and dressed by foresters but Nature rules
untrammelled in the pinebush of the Pacific slope and her waste
material lies piled in tremendous ruin until it rots away There are
forests in that country through which a man accustomed to them can
scarcely make a league in a day Still Nasmyth crossed the divide
struggling against a bitter wind and then went down the other side
floundering over fallen branches and smashing through thickets of
undergrowth and brakes of willows He wanted to find the river and
more especially the tree that bridged it as soon as possible It
was however noon when he reached the river and it frothed and
roared a hundred feet below him in a smooth walled canon which had
apparently kept the frost out for there were only strips of crackling
ice in the eddies
It was clearly out of the question for him to get down to the river
even if he had wished to make the descent and without stopping to
make another fire he plodded along the bank until the afternoon was
almost spent There were a good many fallen trees as he discovered to
his cost since each one had to be painfully clambered over but none
of them spanned the chasm Then as his foot was becoming very sore
he decided to camp where a big cedar lay across a little ravine that
rent the bank It promised to afford him a partial shelter He had no
axe but he tore off an armful or two of the thinner branches with
the twigs attached to them to form a bed and then crawling down to
the river filled his smokeblackened can and came back wearily to
make a fire Man needs very little in those solitudes but there are
two things he must have and those are food to keep the strength in
him and warmth though there are times when he finds it singularly
difficult to make the effort to obtain them The most unpleasant hour
of the long day of persistent toil is often the one when wornout
muscle and jaded intelligence must be forced to the task of providing
the evening meal and shelter for the night
Nasmyth ate his supper so far as it went voraciously but with a
prudent check upon his appetite for he had set out with only four
days provisions and he could not find the tree When he had eaten
he took out his pipe and crouched a while beside the fire shivering
in spite of the blankets wrapped about him The heat dies out of the
man who has marched for twenty hours as those who have done it know
In the meanwhile darkness crept up from the east and the pines faded
into sombre masses that loomed dimly against a leaden sky A mournful
wailing came out of the gloom and the smoke whirled about the
shivering man in the nipping wind while the sound of the rivers
turmoil and the crash of streamdriven ice drifted up out of the
canon Nasmyth listened drowsily while his thoughts wandered back to
the loggers shanty He could see the men with bronzed faces sitting
smoking about the snapping stove two or three of them dancing while
Jacques coaxed music full of fire from his battered fiddle
Then his thoughts went farther back to the chambers that he had once
occupied in London and he saw himself and Frobisher who shared them
with him sitting at a little table daintily furnished with choice
glass and silver covers There were big candles upon itFrobisher
who was a fastidious man had insisted upon them After that the
artistically furnished room faded out of his memory and he recalled a
larger one in which he had now and then dined He could picture the
wine and lights and costly dresses the smiling faces of those who
had at that time expected a great deal from him and he saw the girl
who usually sat at his side She had a delicate beauty and a dainty
mind and he had sometimes fancied they might be drawn closer when he
had made his mark which in those days appeared a very probable thing
He wondered vaguely what she was doing then or if she ever thought of
him After all as she had not answered the one letter which he wrote
it scarcely seemed likely that she remembered him Those who fail he
reflected are soon forgotten
Then as he was falling forward into the fire he roused himself and
smiled wryly He was once more an outcast shivering halfasleep in
the wilderness worn out ragged and aching with a foot that was now
distinctly painful It is however fortunate for such men as he and
others among the heavily burdened that the exhaustion of the body has
its deadening effect upon the mind Rolling the blankets round him he
lay down on the cedar branches and went to sleep
He did not hear the timber wolves howling in the blackness of the
night though several that got wind of him flitted across the ravine
after the fire burned low and when at length he awakened it was
with the fall of a wet flake upon his face and he saw the dim dawn
breaking through a haze of sliding snow It seemed a little warmer
and as a matter of fact it was so for the cold snaps seldom last
very long near the coast but the raw damp struck through him as he
raked the embers of the fire together Again he felt singularly
reluctant to start when he had finished breakfast and he found that
he could hardly place one foot upon the ground but haste was
imperative now so he set off limping with the packstraps galling
his shoulders cruelly He also felt a little dizzy but he pushed on
all that day beside the river through a haze of snow without coming
upon the tree The dusk was creeping up across the forest when at
length the river emerged from the canon and he ventured out upon the
ice in a slacker pool The ice heaved and crackled under him with the
pulsations of the stream but he got across and roused himself with
difficulty for the effort to make another fire He was an hour
gathering fuel and then after a sparing supper he lay down in his
wet clothing
The snow that eddied about him whitened his spongy blankets but he
got a little sleep and awakening found the fire out He tried to
light it and failed His fingers seemed useless He was cramped and
chilled all through and there was in one hipjoint the gnawing pain
that those who sleep on wet ground are acquainted with Sometimes it
goes away when one gets warmed up but just as often it does not
Nasmyth who found it a difficult matter to straighten himself ate a
little damp bread and then strapping his pack upon his shoulders
stumbled on into the forest He afterwards fancied it did not snow
very much that day but he was not sure of anything except that he
fell over many rotten branches and entangled himself frequently in
labyrinths of matted willows Night came and he went to sleep without
a fire He contrived to push on next day walking during most of it
half asleep Indeed now and then he would stagger along for minutes
after consciousness of what he was doing had deserted him for there
are men in that Bush at least who know what it is to stop with
suddenly opened eyes on the verge of a collapse and find that they
have wandered from the pathonly in Nasmyths case there was no path
at all
He was never sure whether it was that day or the next when
floundering through an undergrowth of willows he came upon a break in
the forest that was covered with sawnoff stumps As he made for it
he fell into a splitrail fence some of which he knocked down until
he could climb over it There was a faint smell of burning firwood in
the air and it was evident to him that there was a house somewhere in
the vicinity The snow was not deep in the clearing and he plodded
through it staggering now and then until he came to a little slope
and fell down it headlong This time he did not seem able to get up
again and it was fortunate that when he flung the split fence down
the crash made by the falling rails rang far through the silence of
the woods
While Nasmyth lay in the slushy snow a girl came out from among the
firs across the clearing and walked down the little trail that led
to a well She was tall and there was something in her face and
the way she held herself which suggested that she was not a native of
the Bush though everything she wore had been made by her own
fingersthat is except the little fur cap whose glossy brown
enhanced the lustre of her hair This was of a slightly lighter
tint and had gleams of ruddy gold in it Her eyes were large and
brown and there was a reposeful quietness in the face which
suggested strength It was significant that her hands were a trifle
hard as well as shapely and that her wrists were red
She came to the top of the slope near the foot of which Nasmyth who
had now raised himself on one elbow lay and though this might well
have startled her she stood quietly still looking down on him
Nasmyth raised himself a trifle further and blinked at her stupidly
and she noticed that his face was drawn and grey
I heard the rails fall she said What are you doing there
It did not appear strange to Nasmyth that she should speak in
wellmodulated English for there are probably as many insular English
as Canadians in parts of that country Besides he was scarcely in a
condition to notice a point of that kind just then
I think I upset the fence he answered You see I couldnt get
over Then I must have fallen down
It naturally struck the girl as significant that he did not seem sure
of what had happened but the explanation that would have suggested
itself to anyone fresh from England did not occur to her There was
not a saloon or hotel within eight or nine miles of the spot
Can you get up she asked
Ill try said Nasmyth but the attempt he made was not a complete
success for although he staggered to his feet he reeled when he
stood upon them and probably would have fallen had she not run down
the slope and taken hold of him
You can rest on me she said laying a firm and capable hand upon
his shoulder
With her assistance Nasmyth staggered up the slope and there were
afterwards times when he remembered the next few minutes with somewhat
mixed feelings Just then however he was only glad to have someone
to lean upon and her mere human presence was a relief since Nature
had come very near to crushing the life out of him
This is your ranch he inquired looking at her with halfclosed
eyes when at length she moved away from him a pace or two and
gasping a little stood still beneath a colonnade of towering firs
It is she said simply and a moment or two later he saw a little
house of logs half hidden among the trees
They reached it in another minute and staggering in he sank into
