though and you are the first person to whom I have spoken like this And
you yourself he pointed out encouraged me did you not when you
insisted upon your AustroEnglish nationality
You must not take me too seriously she begged smiling I spoke
foolishly perhaps but only for your good You see Mr Francis Norgate
I am just a little interested in you and your career
And I dear Baroness he replied smiling across at her am more than
a little interested inyou
She unfurled her fan
I believe she sighed that you are going to flirt with me
I should enter into an unequal contest Norgate asserted My methods
would seem too clumsy because I should be too much in earnest
Whatever the truth may be about your methods she declared I rather
like them or else I should not be risking my reputation in this still
prudish city by dining with you alone and without a chaperon Tell me a
little about yourself We have met three times is it notonce at the
Embassy once at the Palace and once when you paid me that call How old
are you Tell me about your people in England and where else you have
served besides Paris
I am thirty years old he replied I started at Bukarest From there
I went to Rome Then I was second attache at Paris and finally as you
see here
And your peoplethey are English of course
Naturally he answered My mother died when I was quite young and my
father when I was at Eton I have an estate in Hampshire which seems to
get on very well without me
And you really care about your profession You have the real feeling for
diplomacy
I think there is nothing else like it in the world he assured her
You may well say that she agreed enthusiastically I think you might
almost add that there has been no time in the history of Europe so
fraught with possibilities so fascinating to study as the present
He looked at her keenly It is the first instinct of a young diplomatist
to draw in his horns when a beautiful young woman confesses herself
interested in his profession
You too think of these things then he remarked
She shrugged her shoulders
But naturally What is there to do for a woman but think We cannot act
or rather if we do it is in a very insignificant way We are lookerson
at most of the things in life worth doing
I will spare you all the obvious retorts he said if you will tell me
why you are gazing into that mirror so earnestly
I was thinking she confessed what a remarkably goodlooking
couple we were
He followed the direction of her eyes He himself was of a recognised
type His complexion was fair his face cleanshaven and strong almost to
ruggedness His mouth was firm his nose thin and straight his grey eyes
wellset He was over six feet and rather slim for his height But if his
type though attractive enough was in its way ordinary hers was
entirely unusual She too was slim but so far from being tall her
figure was almost petite Her dark brown hair was arranged in perfectly
plain braids behind and with a slight fringe in front Her complexion was
pale Her features were almost cameolike in their delicacy and
perfection but any suggestion of coldness was dissipated at once by the
extraordinary expressiveness of her mouth and the softness of her deep
blue eyes Norgate looked from the mirror into her face There was a
little smile upon his lips but he said nothing
Some day she said not in the restaurant here but when we are
alone and have time I should so much like to talk with you on really
serious matters
There is one serious matter he assured her which I should like to
discuss with you now or at any time
She made a little grimace at him
Let it be now then she suggested leaning across the table We will
leave my sort of serious things for another time I am quite certain
that I know where your sort is going to lead us You are going to make
love to me
Do you mind he asked earnestly
She became suddenly grave
Not yet she begged Let us talk and live nonsense for a few more
weeks You see I really have not known you very long have I and this
is a very dangerous city for flirtations At Court one has to be so
careful and you know I am already considered far too much of a Bohemian
here I was even given to understand a little time ago by a very great
lady that my position was quite precarious
Does thatdoes anything matter if
It is not of myself alone that I am thinking Everything matters to one
in your profession she reminded him pointedly
I believe he exclaimed that you think more of my profession than you
do of me
Quite impossible she retorted mockingly And yet as I dare say you
have already realised it is not only the things you say to our statesmen
here and the reports you make which count It is your daily life among
the people of the nation to which you are attached the friends you make
among them the hospitality you accept and offer which has all the time
its subtle significance Now I am not sure even that I am a very good
companion for you Mr Francis Norgate
You are a very bad one for my peace of mind he assured her
She shook her head You say those things much too glibly she declared
I am afraid that you have served a very long apprenticeship
If I have he replied leaning a little across the table it has been
an apprenticeship only a probationary period during which one struggles
towards the real thing
You think you will know when you have found it she murmured
He drew a little breath His voice even trembled as he answered her I
know now he said softly
Their heads were almost touching Suddenly she drew apart He glanced at
her in some surprise conscious of an extraordinary change in her face
of the halfuttered exclamation strangled upon her lips He turned his
head and followed the direction of her eyes Three young men in the
uniform of officers had entered the room and stood there as though
looking about for a table Before them the little company of headwaiters
had almost prostrated themselves The manager summoned in breathless
haste had made a reverential approach
Who are these young men Norgate enquired
His companion made no reply Her fine silky eyebrows were drawn a
little closer together At that moment the tallest of the three
newcomers seemed to recognise her He strode at once towards their
table Norgate glancing up at his approach was simply conscious of the
coming of a fair young man of ordinary German type who seemed to be in
a remarkably bad temper
So I find you here Anna
The Baroness rose as though unwillingly to her feet She dropped the
slightest of curtseys and resumed her place
Your visit is a little unexpected is it not Karl she remarked
Apparently the young man answered with an unpleasant laugh
He turned and stared at Norgate who returned his regard with
halfamused halfimpatient indifference The Baroness leaned
forward eagerly
Will you permit me to present Mr Francis Norgate to you Karl
Norgate who had suddenly recognised the newcomer rose to his feet
bowed and remained standing The Princes only reply to the introduction
was a frown
Kindly give me your seat he said imperatively I will conclude your
entertainment of the Baroness
For a moment there was a dead silence In the background several of
the maitres dhotel had gathered obsequiously around For some
reason or other every one seemed to be looking at Norgate as though
he were a criminal
Isnt your request a little unusual Prince he remarked drily
The colour in the young mans face became almost purple
Did you hear what I said sir he demanded Do you know who I am
Perfectly Norgate replied A prince who apparently has not learnt how
to behave himself in a public place
The young man took a quick step forward Norgates fists were clenched
and his eyes glittering The Baroness stepped between them
Mr Norgate she said you will please give me your escort home
The Princes companions had seized him one by either arm An older man
who had been dining in a distant corner of the room and who wore the
uniform of an officer of high rank suddenly approached He addressed the
Prince and they all talked together in excited whispers Norgate with
calm fingers arranged the cloak around his companion and placed a hundred
mark note upon his plate
I will return for my change another evening he said to the dumbfounded
waiter If you are ready Baroness
They left the restaurant amid an intense hush Norgate waited
deliberately whilst the door was somewhat unwillingly held open for him
by a maitre dhotel but outside the Baronesss automobile was summoned
at once She placed her fingers upon Norgates arm and he felt that she
was shivering
Please do not take me home she faltered I am so sorryso
very sorry
He laughed But why he protested The young fellow behaved like a
cub but no one offered him any provocation I should think by this time
he is probably heartily ashamed of himself May I come and see you
tomorrow
Telephone me she begged as she gave him her hand through the window
You dont quite understand Please telephone to me
She suddenly clutched his hand with both of hers and then fell back out
of sight among the cushions Norgate remained upon the pavement until the
car had disappeared Then he looked back once more into the restaurant
and strolled across the brilliantlylit street towards the Embassy
CHAPTER II
Norgate during his months stay in Berlin had already adopted regular
habits On the following morning he was called at eight oclock and rode
for two hours in the fashionable precincts of the city The latter
portion of the time he spent looking in vain for a familiar figure in a
green ridinghabit The Baroness however did not appear At ten oclock
Norgate returned to the Embassy bathed and breakfasted and a little
after eleven made his way round to the business quarters One of his
fellowworkers there glanced up and nodded at his arrival
Wheres the Chief Norgate enquired
Gone down to the Palace the other young man whose name was Ansell
replied telephoned for the first thing this morning Ghastly habit
William has of getting up at seven oclock and suddenly remembering that
he wants to talk diplomacy The Chief will be furious all day now
Norgate lit a cigarette and began to open his letters Ansell however
was in a discoursive mood He swung around from his desk and leaned back
in his chair
How can a man he demanded see a question from the same point of view
at seven oclock in the morning and seven oclock in the evening
Absolutely impossible you know Thats whats the matter with our
versatile friend up yonder He gets all aroused over some scheme or other
which comes to him in the dead of night hops out of bed before any one
civilised is awake and rings up for ambassadors Then at nighttime he
becomes normal again and takes everything back The consequence is that
this place is a regular diplomatic seesaw Settling down in Berlin
pretty well arent you Norgate
Very nicely thanks the latter replied
Dining alone with the Baroness von Haase his junior continued A
Court favourite too Never been seen alone before except with her young
princeling What honeyed words did you use Lothario
Oh chuck it Norgate interrupted Tell me about the Baroness von
Haase She is Austrian isnt she
Ansell nodded
Related to the Hapsburgs themselves I believe he said Very old
family anyhow They say she came to spend a season here because she was
a little too goahead for the ladies of Vienna I must say that Ive
never seen her out without a chaperon before except with Prince Karl
They say hed marry hermorganatically of courseif theyd let him
and if the lady were willing If you want to know anything more about
her go into Grays room
Norgate looked up from his letters
Why Grays room How does she come into his department
Ansell shook his head
No idea I fancy she is there though
Norgate left the room a few minutes later and strolling across the
hall of the Embassy made his way to an apartment at the back of the
house It was plainly furnished there were bars across the window and
three immense safes let into the wall An elderly gentleman with
goldrimmed spectacles and a very benevolent expression was busy with
several books of reference before him seated at a desk He raised his
head at Norgates entrance
Good morning Norgate he said
Good morning sir Norgate replied
Anything in my way
Norgate shook his head
Chiefs gone to the Palaceno one knows why I just looked in because I
met a woman the other day whom Ansell says you know something
aboutBaroness von Haase
Well
Is there anything to be told about her Norgate asked bluntly I dined
with her last night
Then I dont think I would again if I were you the other advised
There is nothing against her but she is a great friend of certain
members of the Royal Family who are not very well disposed towards us
and she is rather a brainy little person They use her a good deal I
believe as a means of confidential communication between here and
Vienna She has been back and forth three or four times lately without
any apparent reason
Norgate stood with his hands in his pockets frowning slightly
Why shes half an Englishwoman he remarked
She may be Mr Gray admitted drily The other halfs Austrian all
right though I cant tell you anything more about her my dear fellow
All I can say is that she is in my book and so long as she is there you
know its better for you youngsters to keep away Be off now I am
decoding a dispatch
Norgate retraced his steps to his own room Ansell glanced up from a mass
of passports as he entered
Hows the Secret Service Department this morning he enquired
Old Gray seems much as usual Norgate grumbled One doesnt get much
out of him
Chief wants you in his room Ansell announced Hes just come in from
the Palace looking like nothing on earth
Wants me Norgate muttered Righto
He went to the lookingglass straightened his tie and made his way
towards the Ambassadors private apartments The latter was alone when he
entered seated before his table He was leaning back in his chair
however and apparently deep in thought He watched Norgate sternly as he
crossed the room
Good morning sir the latter said
The Ambassador nodded
What have you been up to Norgate he asked abruptly
Nothing at all that I know of sir was the prompt reply
This afternoon the Ambassador continued slowly I was to have taken
you as you know to the Palace to be received by the Kaiser At seven
oclock this morning I had a message I have just come from the Palace
The Kaiser has given me to understand that your presence in Berlin is
unwelcome
Good God Norgate exclaimed
Can you offer me any explanation
For a moment Norgate was speechless Then he recovered himself He forgot
altogether his habits of restraint There was an angry note in his tone
Its that miserable young cub of a Prince Karl he exclaimed
Last night I was dining sir with the Baroness von Haase at the
Cafe de Berlin
Alone
Alone Norgate admitted It was not for me to invite a chaperon if the
lady did not choose to bring one was it sir As we were finishing
dinner the Prince came in He made a scene at our table and ordered me
to leave
And you the Ambassador asked
I simply treated him as I would any other young ass who forgot
himself Norgate replied indignantly I naturally refused to go and
the Baroness left the place with me
And you did not expect to hear of this again
I honestly didnt I should have thought for his own sake that the
young man would have kept his mouth shut He was hopelessly in the wrong
and he behaved like a common young bounder
The Ambassador shook his head slowly
Mr Norgate he said I am very sorry for you but you are under a
misapprehension shared by many young men You believe that there is a
universal standard of manners and deportment and a universal series of
customs for all nations You have our English standard of manners in your
mind manners which range from a ploughboy to a king and you seem to
take it for granted that these are also subscribed to in other countries
In my position I do not wish to say too much but let me tell you that in
Germany they are not If a prince here chooses to behave like a
ploughboy he is right where the ploughboy would be wrong
There was a moments silence Norgate was looking a little dazed
Then you mean to defend he began
Certainly not the Ambassador interrupted I am not speaking to you as
one of ourselves I am speaking as the representative of England in
Berlin You are supposed to be studying diplomacy You have been guilty
of a colossal blunder You have shown yourself absolutely ignorant of the
ideals and customs of the country in which you are It is perfectly
correct for young Prince Karl to behave as you put it like a bounder
The people expect it of him He conforms entirely to the standard
accepted by the military aristocracy of Berlin It is you who have been
in the wrongdiplomatically
Then you mean sir Norgate protested that I should have taken it
sitting down
Most assuredly you should the Ambassador replied unless you were
willing to pay the price Your only faultyour personal fault I
meanthat I can see is that it was a little indiscreet of you to dine
alone with a young woman for whom the Prince is known to have a
foolish passion Diplomatically however you have committed every
fault possible I am very sorry but I think that you had better
report in Downing Street as soon as possible The train leaves I
think at three oclock
Norgate for a moment was unable to speak or move He was struggling with
a sort of blind fury
This is the end of me then he muttered at last I am to be disgraced
because I have come to a city of boors
You are reprimanded and in a sense no doubt punished the Ambassador
explained calmly because you have come toshall I accept your terma
city of boors and fail to adapt yourself The true diplomatist adapts
himself wherever he may be My personal sympathies remain with you I
will do what I can in my report
Norgate had recovered himself
I thank you very much sir he said I shall catch the three
oclock train
The Ambassador held out his hand The interview had finished He
permitted himself to speak differently
I am very sorry indeed Norgate that this has happened he declared
We all have our trials to bear in this city and you have run up
against one of them rather before your time I wish you good luck
whatever may happen
Norgate clasped his Chiefs hand and left the apartment Then he made his
way to his rooms gave his orders and sent a messenger to secure his seat
in the train Last of all he went to the telephone He rang up the number
which had become already familiar to him almost with reluctance He
waited for the reply without any pleasurable anticipations He was filled
with a burning sense of resentment a feeling which extended even to the
innocent cause of it Soon he heard her voice
That is Mr Norgate is it not
Yes he replied I rang up to wish you goodby
Goodby But you are going away then
I am sent awaydismissed
He heard her little exclamation of grief Its complete genuineness broke
down a little the wall of his anger
And it is my fault she exclaimed If only I could do anything Will
you waitplease wait I will go to the Palace myself
His expostulation was almost a shock to her
Baroness he replied if I permitted your intervention I could never
hold my head up in Berlin again In any case I could not stay here The
first thing I should do would be to quarrel with that insufferable young
cad who insulted us last night I am afraid at the first opportunity I
should tell
Hush she interrupted Oh please hush You must not talk like
this even over the telephone Cannot you understand that you are not
in England
I am beginning to realise he answered gruffly what it means not to
be in a free country I am leaving by the three oclock train Baroness
Farewell
But you must not go like this she pleaded Come first and see me
No It will only mean more disgrace for you Besidesin any case I
have decided to go away without seeing you again
Her voice was very soft He found himself gripping the pages of the
telephone book which hung by his side
But is that kind Have I sinned Mr Francis Norgate
Of course not he answered keeping his tone level almost indifferent
I hope that we shall meet again some day but not in Berlin
There was a moments silence He thought even that she had gone away
Then her reply came back
So be it she murmured Not in Berlin Au revoir
CHAPTER III
Faithful to his insular prejudices Norgate on finding that the other
seat in his coupe was engaged started out to find the train attendant
with a view to changing his place His errand however was in vain The
train it seemed was crowded He returned to his compartment to find
already installed there one of the most complete and absolute types of
Germanism he had ever seen A man in a light grey suit the waistcoat of
which had apparently abandoned its efforts to compass his girth with a
broad pink goodhumoured face beardless and bland flaxen hair
streaked here and there with grey was seated in the vacant place He had
with him a portmanteau covered with a linen case his boots were a bright
shade of yellow his tie was of white satin with a design of lavender
flowers A pair of black kid gloves lay by his side He welcomed Norgate
with the bland broad smile of a fellowpassenger whose one desire it is
to make a lifelong friend of his temporary companion
We have the compartment to ourselves is it not so You are English
Some queer chance founded upon his illhumour his disgust of Germany and
all things in it induced Norgate to tell a deliberate falsehood
Sorry he replied in English I dont speak German
The mans satisfaction was complete
But II speak the most wonderful English It pleases me always to speak
English I like to do so It is practice for me We will talk English
together you and I These comic papers they do not amuse And books in
the train they make one giddy What I like best is a companion and a
bottle of Rhine wine
Personally Norgate confessed gruffly I like to sleep
The other seemed a little taken aback but remained apparently full of
the conviction that his overtures could be nothing but acceptable
It is well to sleep he agreed if one has worked hard Now I myself
am a hard worker My name is Selingman I manufacture crockery which I
sell in England That is why I speak the English language so wonderful
For the last three nights I have been up reading reports of my English
customers going through their purchases Now it is finished I am well
posted I am off to sell crockery in London in Manchester in Leeds in
Birmingham I have what the people want They will receive me with open
arms some of them even welcome me at their houses Thus it is that I
look forward to my business trip as a holiday
Very pleasant Im sure Norgate remarked curling himself up in his
corner Personally I cant see why we cant make our own crockery I
get tired of seeing German goods in England
Herr Selingman was apparently a trifle hurt but his efforts to make
himself agreeable were indomitable
If you will he said I can explain why my crockery sells in England
where your own fails For one thing then I am cheaper There is a
system at my works the like of which is not known in England From the
raw material to the finished article I can produce forty per cent
cheaper than your makers and mind you that is not because I save in
wages It is because of the system in the various departments I do not
like to save in wages he went on I like to see my people healthy and
strong and happy I like to see them drink beer after work is over and
on feast days and Sundays I like to see them sit in the gardens and
listen to the band and maybe change their beer for a bottle of wine
Industrially Mr Englishman ours is a happy country
Well I hope you wont think I am rude Norgate observed but from the
little I have seen of it I call it a beastly country and if you dont
mind I am going to sleep
Herr Selingman sat for several moments with his mouth still open Then he
gave a little grunt There was not the slightest illhumour in the
ejaculation or in his expression He was simply pained
I am sorry if I have talked too much he said I forgot that you
perhaps are tired You have met with disappointments maybe I am sorry
I will read now and not disturb you
For an hour or so Norgate tried in vain to sleep All this time the man
opposite turned the pages of his book with the utmost cautiousness
moved on tiptoe once to reach down more papers and held out his finger
to warn the train attendant who came with some harmless question
The English gentleman Norgate heard him whisper is tired Let
him sleep
Soon after five oclock Norgate gave it up He rose to his feet
stretched himself and was welcomed with a pleasant smile from his
companion
You have had a refreshing nap the latter remarked and now is it not
so you go to take a cup of English tea
You are quite right Norgate admitted Better come with me
Herr Selingman smiled a smile of triumph It was the reward of geniality
this He was forming a new friendship
I come with great pleasure he decided only while you drink the tea
I drink the coffee or some beer I will see I like best the beer he
explained turning sidewise to get out of the door but it is not the
best for my figure I have a good conscience and a good digestion and I
eat and drink much But it is good to be happy
They made their way down to the restaurant car and seated themselves at a
table together
You let me do the ordering Herr Selingman insisted The man here
perhaps does not speak English So You will drink your tea with me
sir It is a great pleasure to me to entertain an Englishman I make many
friends travelling I like to make friends I remember them all and
sometimes we meet again Kellner some tea for the gentlemanEnglish
tea with what you call bread and butter So And for me Selingman
paused for a moment and drew a deep sigh of resignationsome coffee
Very kind of you Im sure Norgate murmured
Herr Selingman beamed
It is a great pleasure he said but many times I wonder why you
Englishmen so clever so worldconquering do not take the trouble to
make yourselves with the languages of other nations familiar It means
but a little study Now you perhaps are in business
Not exactly Norgate replied grimly To tell you the truth at the
present moment I have no occupation
No occupation
Herr Selingman paused in the act of conveying a huge portion of rusk to
his mouth and regarded his companion with wonder
So he repeated No occupation Well that is what in Germany we know
nothing of Every one must work or must take up the army as a permanent
profession You are perhaps one of those Englishmen of whom one reads
who give up all their time to sport
Norgate shook his head
As a matter of fact he said I have worked rather hard during the
last five or six years It is only just recently that I have lost my
occupation
Herr Selingmans curiosity was almost childlike in its transparency but
Norgate found himself unable to gratify it In any case after his
denial of any knowledge of the German language he could scarcely lay
claim to even the most indirect connection with the diplomatic service
Ah well Herr Selingman declared opportunities will come You have
perhaps lost some post Well there are others I should not I think be
far away from the truth sir if I were to surmise that you had held some
sort of an official position
Perhaps Norgate assented
That is interesting Herr Selingman continued Now with the English of
commerce I talk often and I know their views of me and my country But
sometimes I have fancied that among your official classes those who are
ever so slightly employed in Government service there isI do not love
the word but I must use ita distrust of Germany and her peaceloving
propensities
I have met many people Norgate admitted who do not look upon Germany
as a lover of peace
They should come and travel here Herr Selingman insisted eagerly
Look out of the windows What do you see Factory chimneys furnaces
everywhere And further onwhat Welltilled lands clean prosperous
villages a happy domestic people I tell you that no man in the world
is so fond of his wife and children his simple life his simple
pleasures as the German
Very likely Norgate assented but if you look out of the windows
continually you will also see that every stationmaster on the line wears
