dishonorable a thing it was for him that his yoonger brother should
possesse the crowne of England which of right as he said belonged
vnto him by reason of his age he determined with all expedition to
passe the seas with an armie and recouer that into his hands which
his father had giuen from him partlie as it is thought for his
wilfulnesse and disobedience towards him and partly also bicause he
doubted that if he should leaue it vnto him he would through his too
much gentlenesse and facilitie giue occasion to the English to resume
strength and therby to reuolt Wherefore he iudged his yoonger
brother the saied William a man of a rougher nature the meeter of
the twaine for the gouernement
As duke Robert was thus mooued by his owne desire to bereue his brother
of the dominion of England so he was not a little incensed thervnto by
such of the English Nobilitie and Normans as came dailie ouer vnto him
out of the realme complaining of the present state of the world as
those misliked of the whole maner of regiment vsed in the beginning of
the reigne of his brother William His vncle Odo also then bishop of
Baieux furthered the matter all that he might This Odo was at first in
great estimation with his brother the Conqueror and bare great rule
vnder him till at length for enuie that the archbishop Lanfranke was
preferred before him he conspired against him who vnderstanding
thereof committed him foorthwith to prison where he remained till
the said prince then lieng on his deathbed released and restored
him to his former libertie When the king was dead William Rufus
tooke him backe into England supposing no lesse but to haue had a
speciall freend and a trustie counceller of him in all his affaires
But yer long after his comming thither he fell againe into the same
offense of ingratitude wherof he became culpable in the Conquerors
daies for perceiuing that Lanfranke was so highlie esteemed with the
king that he could beare no rule and partlie suspecting that
Lanfranke had been cheefe causer of his former imprisonment
Sidenote Odo the bishop of Baieux conspireth against his nephue
William Rufus he conspired with the rest against his nephue and
therevpon wrote sundrie letters ouer vnto duke Robert counselling him
to come ouer with an armie in all hast to take the rule vpon him
which by his practise should easilie be compassed
Duke Robert being thus animated on all sides and yet wanting
sufficient monie to the furniture of this iournie engaged a portion
of his duchie of Normandie as the countie of Constantine to his
yoongest brother Henrie for a great sum of gold and therwith
returned answer to the foresaid bishop that he should prouide and
looke for him vpon the south coast of England at a certeine time
appointed Sidenote The castell of Rochester Herevpon Odo
fortified the castell of Rochester  began to make sore wars against
the kings friends in Kent he procured others of the complices also to
do the like in other parts of the realme Sidenote Simon Dun
Wil Malm The bishop of Constance taketh the town of Bath and
first on the west part of England where Geffrey bishop of Constans
with his nephue Robert de Mowbray earle of Northumberland setting
foorth from Bristow came toward Bath which towne they tooke and
sacked and likewise Berkley with a great part of Wiltshire and
brought the spoile and booties backe to Bristow where they had a
castell stronglie fortified for their more safetie In like maner
Roger de Bygod departing from Norwich with great forraies ouerrode
and robbed all the countries about and conueied such riches as he had
gotten into the said citie Sidenote Hugh Grandmesnill Hen Hunt
Wil Mal In like sort did Hugh de Grandmesnill at Leiceister
spoiling and wasting all the countries about him
Sidenote The earle of Shrewsburie The earle of Shrewsburie called
Roger de Mountgomerie with a power of Welshmen set foorth from
Shrewsburie and with him were William bishop of Durham the kings
houshold chapline Barnard of Newmerch Roger Lacie and Rafe
Mortimer all Normans or Frenchmen who ioyning their powers
togither inuaded the countrie and with fire and sword did much hurt
where they came killing and taking a great number of people
Sidenote Worcester assaulted Afterwards comming to Worcester they
assaulted the citie ouerran the suburbs  set the same on fire But
the citizens shutting fast the gates of their citie though with the
sudden comming of the enimies they were somewhat afraid made valiant
resistance and conueieng their goods their wiues and their children
into the castell got them to the walles and places of defense to
repell and beat backe the enimies Sidenote Bishop Woolstan Among
them in the towne was bishop Woolstan whom the citizens would haue
compelled to go into the castell for his surer safegard but he
refused it
At length it chanced that the enimies continuing the said siege
began to wax negligent and ranged abroad in the countrie little
regarding watch and ward about their campe wherevpon the English
within the citie tooke this oportunitie being mooued thereto with the
comfortable exhortation of bishop Woolstan and sailing foorth of the
towne did set on their enimies with great fiercenes whome they got at
such aduantage Sidenote They slue fiue hundred and chased the
residue as saith Simon Dunel that they slue and tooke that daie
aboue fiue M men as Henrie of Huntingdon recordeth For the English
bearing a continuall malice in their hearts against the French and
Normans did now their best to be fullie reuenged of them vpon so
conuenient an occasion offered Those that escaped by flight hid
themselues in the next townes making such shifts for their liues as
the present necessitie could minister
Sidenote The diligence of the archbishop Lanfranke Whilest the
realme was thus troubled on ech side archbishop Lanfranke sendeth
writeth and admonisheth all the kings freends to make themselues
readie to defend their prince And after he vnderstood that they were
assembled togither for that purpose he counselleth the king to march
into the field with them speedilie to represse his enimies
Sidenote The great curtesie shewed to the Englishmen by Wil Rufus
Simon Dun The king following his counsell first appointed his
nauie to scowre and keepe the seas and to withstand if it were
possible the arriuall of his brother by faire words Also he
reconcileth Roger de Mountgomerie earle of Shrewsburie vnto him and
therewith maketh large promises to the English that he would out of
hand giue and restore vnto them such fauourable lawes as they would
wish or desire Moreouer he commanded all vniust imposts tolles and
tallages to be laid downe and granted free hunting in the woods
chases and forrests All which grants and promises he kept not long
though for the time he greatlie contented the people with such a shew
of good meaning towards them Sidenote Wil Malm This doone he
goeth with a mightie armie into Kent where the sedition began and
first comming to the castell of Tunbridge he compelled capteine
Gilbert to yeeld vp the fortresse into his hands Then went he to
Horne castell where he heard saie Odo was but the report was vntrue
for he had betaken himselfe to the castell of Pemsey which when he
had ouerthrowne he hasted forth vnto Pemsey and besieged the castell
there a long season which the bishop had stronglie fortified
During this time and about the fiftieth daie after the beginning of
the siege word was brought to the king that his brother duke Robert
was landed at Southampton and minded with all possible speed to come
to the succour of the bishop and of other his freends whom he and
his power had not a little afflicted Sidenote H Hunt Simon
Dun  Here authors varie for some report that duke Robert came not
ouer himselfe the first at all but sent a part of his armie with a
certeine number of ships which encountring with the kings fleet were
discomfited Others write that duke Robert hearing of the losse of his
men came after himselfe and landed with a mightie armie as before
which is most likelie Sidenote Gemeticensis Eustace earle of
Bullongne And certeinlie as Gemeticen affirmeth he might easilie
as then haue recouered England from his brother if he had not lingred
the time considering that Eustace earle of Bullongne Odo bishop of
Baieux and the earle of Mortaigne with other lords of Normandie that
were passed to England had alreadie taken Rochester and diuers other
castels in the prouince of Canturburie keeping the same a certeine
time still looking that he should haue come ouer to their aid which
he deferred to doo till they were constreined by siege and lacke of
necessarie succor to returne into Normandie leauing those places
which they had won vnto the king and that to their great dishonor
Sidenote Simon Dun But howsoeuer it was the king still
continued the siege before Pemsey castell till Odo through want of
victuals was glad to submit himselfe and promised to cause the
castell of Rochester to be deliuered but at his comming thither they
within the citie suffered him to enter and streightwaies laid him
fast in prison Some iudge that it was doone vnder a colour by his
owne consent
There were in Rochester a sort of valiant gentlemen the flower in
maner of all Normandie with Eustace earle of Bolongne and manie
gentlemen of Flanders which were in mind to defend the place against
the king Sidenote Rochester besieged by the king who hearing what
was doone came with his armie and besieged the citie of Rochester on
ech side so sharpelie that they within were glad to deliuer it vp
into his hands Sidenote An Reg 2 Sidenote Polydor
Sidenote 1089 Thus lost bishop Odo all his liuings and dignities
in England and so returned into Normandie where vnder duke Robert he
had the cheefe gouernement of the countrie committed vnto him
After this he ouercame diuers of his enimies some by faire and some by
fowle meanes Notwithstanding this there yet remained the bishop of
Durham one of the cheefe conspirators who withdrew himselfe into the
citie of Durham there to lie in safetie till he saw how the world
would go but being therein besieged by the king who came thither
personallie he was at length forced to surrender the city and yeeld
himselfe Sidenote The bishop of Durham exiled wherevpon also he
was exiled the land with diuerse of his complices But within two
yeares after he was called home againe and restored to his church
wherein he liued not long but died for sorrow bicause he could not
cleere himselfe of offense in the said rebellion albeit that he
laboured most earnestlie so to doo that he might thereby haue
atteined to the kings fauor againe
Sidenote Lanfranke archbishop of Canturburie departeth this life
Whilest these things were thus in hand the archbishop Lanfranke
falleth sicke and dieth in the 19 yeare after his first entring into
the gouernment of the sea of Canturburie This Lanfranke as should
seeme was a wise politike and learned prelate who whilest he
liued mollified the furious and cruell nature of king William Rufus
instructing him to forbeare such wild and outragious behauiours as his
youthfulnesse was inclined vnto and moreouer persuaded the English to
obey the same king as their loiall prince whereby they should
occasion him to be their good lord and king not vsing them
rigorouslie as his father had doon So that Lanfranke could not well
haue beene spared in the time of the rebellion without great danger
of subuerting the state of the commonwealth He builded two hospitals
without the citie of Canturburie for the releefe of poore people and
strangers the one of S John the other at Harbaldowne He aduanced
the church of Rochester from foure secular clerkes to the number of
fiftie moonkes Sidenote Matth Westm Paule abbat of S Albons
he repaired Christes church in Canturburie and the abbey of S
Albons whereof he made one Paule that was his nephue abbat which
Paule gouerned that house by his vncles assistance greatlie to the
aduancement thereof as well in temporall as spirituall preferments
as it was then iudged Likewise the said Lanfranke was verie fortunate
in the gouernement of his church and see of Canturburie recouering
sundrie portions of lands and rents alienated from the same before his
daies insomuch that he restored to that see 25 manors Sidenote
Eadmerus For amongst other whereas Odo the bishop of Baieux who
also was earle of Kent bearing great rule in England vnder his nephue
king William the Conquerour had vsurped diuerse possessions which
belonged to the see of Canturburie and had seized the franchises
apperteining to the same Lanfranke into his owne hands by sute and
earnest trauell he recouered the same and being impleaded about that
matter by the said Odo he so defended his cause that in the end
though with much adoo he had his will and so remained in quiet
possession of his right after that so long as he liued without any
trouble or vexation concerning the said possessions and liberties
Whereas also not onelie Walkhem the bishop of Winchester but diuerse
other bishops in England were in mind to haue displaced moonks out of
their cathedrall churches and to haue brought canons into their
roomes Lanfranke withstood them and would tollerate no such
dislocation Sidenote Lanfranke praised for holding with the
moonks an act at that time so well liked that he was highlie
commended for the same Sidenote The king giuen to sensuall lust and
couetousnesse After Lanfrankes death the king began greatlie to
forget himselfe in all his dealings insomuch that he kept many
concubines and waxed verie cruell and inconstant in all his dooings
so that he became an heauie burthen vnto his people For he was so
much addicted to gather goods that he considered not what perteined
to the maiestie of a king insomuch that nothing tending to his gaine
and the satisfieng of his appetite was esteemed of him vnlawfull
sith he measured all things by the vncontrolled rule of his roialtie
and considered nothing what so high an office required He kept the
see of Canturburie foure yeares in his hands to see who would giue
most for it in the meane time taking the profits thereof and making
the vttermost of the same that by any meanes could be deuised
Sidenote Matth Paris The like he vsed when other benefices and
abbeies were vacant and furthermore that little which the prince
spared his officers and farmers no lesse couetous than he conuerted
to their aduantage so that what by the king and what by his
procurators the church of England was now sore charged and fleeced of
hir wealth Diuerse of hir prelates in like maner were not a little
offended to see their mother so spoiled of hir treasure and
liuelihood insomuch that they practised a redresse and to begin
withall complained of the king to pope Vrban but he was so busied
with other troubles of his owne neerer home that he could haue no
time to seeke meanes how to redresse enormities a far off Sidenote
Wil Malm Matt Paris whereby the lands and goods belonging to
the church here in England were still wastfullie spent and consumed
by the king and others to whome he gaue or let them foorth to farme
at his owne pleasure and to his most commoditie
But albeit the prince was of such a disposition by nature yet there is
one thing written of him which ought not to be forgotten to admonish vs
that there is no man of so euill an affection but that sometime he
dealeth vprightlie though it be by hap or other extraordinarie motion
It chanced that an abbeie was void of an abbat wherein were two moonkes
verie couetous persons aboue the rest and such as by scraping and
gathering togither were become verie rich for such saith Polydor in
those daies mounted to preferment These two appointed to go togither to
the court ech hoping at their comming thither to find some meanes that
he might be made abbat of that house Being thus agreed to the court
they come and there offer verie largelie to the king to obteine their
sute who perceiuing their greedie desires and casting his eies about
the chamber espied by chance an other moonke that came to beare them
companie being a more sober man and simple after his outward
appearance whom he called vnto him and asked what he would giue him to
be made abbat of the foresaid abbeie The moonke after a little pause
made answere that he would giue nothing at all for anie such purpose
since he entred into that profession of meere zeale to despise riches
all worldlie pompe to the end he might the more quietlie serue God in
holinesse  puritie of conuersation Saiest thou so quoth the king
then art thou euen he that art worthie to gouerne this house and
streightwaie he bestowed the house vpon him iustlie refusing the other
two to their open infamie and reproch
Sidenote Matt Paris Sidenote An Reg 3 1090 But to
returne to our historie After the expulsion of the bishop of Durham
and other of his adherents the king passed ouer into Normandie
purposing to depriue his brother of that dukedome and being arriued
there he besieged and tooke S Ualerie Albemarle and diuerse other
townes and castels wherein he placed a number of his best souldiers
Sidenote Simon Dun Warres betwixt the king and his brother
Robert the better to mainteine warre against his foresaid brother
Herevpon also the said Robert sent vnto the French king for aid who
came downe at his request with a noble armie and besieged one of
those castels which king William had latelie woone howbeit by such
meanes as king William made in sending to the French king an huge
summe of monie he raised his siege shortlie  returned home againe
Sidenote An Reg 4 1091 Sidenote Gemeticensis A peace
concluded Simon Dun Matth West Matt Paris At length a
peace was concluded betwixt king William and the duke his brother but
yet verie dishonorable to the said Robert for it was accorded that
king William should reteine  still inioy the countie of Ewe with
Fescampe the abbasie of mount S Michell Chereburg and all those
other places which he had woone  gotten out of his hands in this his
late voiage On the other side it was agreed that king William should
aid the duke to recouer all other places beyond the seas which
belonged to their father Also that such Normans as had lost anie of
their lands  liuings in England for taking part with the duke in the
late rebellion should be restored to the same And furthermore that
whether soeuer of both should die first the suruiuer should be his
heire and succeed in his dominions
Sidenote Gemeticensis This peace was concluded at Caen and that
by procurement of the French king at what time king William was verie
strong in the field neare vnto Ewe After which conclusion they
vnited their powers and besieged their yoongest brother Henrie in the
castell of mount S Michell which being situat in the confines of
Normandie and Britaine he had stronglie fortified not long before for
feare of afterclaps But when they had lien about it by the space of
all the Lent season and had made manie bickerings with his men more
to their losse than lucre they raised their siege and voluntarilie
departed Sidenote Sim Dunel Not long after this king William
depriued Edgar Etheling of his honor which duke Robert had assigned
vnto him banishing him out of Normandie for euer
Shortlie after also the aforesaid Henrie wan a strong towne called
Damfront and furnishing it at all points he kept the same in his
possession as long as he liued mauger both his brethren Thus the war
waxed hot betweene those three howbeit suddenlie I wot not vpon what
occasion this Henrie was reconciled with king William and his brother
Robert so that all debates being quieted on euerie side they were made
friends and welwillers King William also returned into England hauing
his brother Robert in his companie all men reioising at their
pacification and amitie which happened in the yeare 1091 and fourth of
the reigne of the king
Toward the end whereof and vpon the fift daie of October a
maruellous sore tempest fell in sundrie parts of England but
especiallie in the towne of Winchcombe where by force of thunder and
lightning a part of the steeple of the church was throwne downe and
the crucifix with the image of Marie standing vnder the roodloft was
likewise ouerthrowne broken and shattered in peeces then folowed a
foule a noisome and a most horrible stinke in the church Sidenote
A mightie wind On the 17 daie of the same moneth much harme was
doone in London with an outragious wind the violence whereof
ouerturned and rent in peeces aboue fiue hundred houses at which time
and tempest the roofe of S Marie bowe church in cheape was also
ouerthrowne wherewith two men were slaine Sidenote An Reg 5
1092 Moreouer at Salisburie much hurt was doone with the like wind
and thunder for the top of the steeple and manie buildings besides
were sore shaken and cast downe But now we will speake somewhat of
the doings of Scotland as occasion moueth Sidenote The scots
inuade England Whilest as yee haue heard variance depended
betweene king William and his brother duke Robert the Scotish king
Malcolme made sore wars vpon the inhabitants of Northumberland
carrieng great booties and preies out of that countrie which he
inuaded euen to Chester in the street Wherefore king William soone
after his returne gathered his power togither and sped him
northwards But king Malcolme hearing of his puissance  great
strength sent to him for peace which was granted in the end
Sidenote Wil Malm Sim Dun Some writers affirme that king
William prepared a great armie both by sea and land against Malcolme
and that his nauie being abroad on the seas was lost by tempest and
the most part of his ships drowned that the armie by land entring
into Scotland suffered manie damages through want of vittels and so
recoiled finallie that duke Robert lieng on the borders with an
armie in his brothers name wherby it should appeare that the king
himselfe was not there by the helpe and furtherance of Edgar
Etheling who then serued K Malcolme in his wars concluded a peace
betwixt his brother and the said Malcolme vpon certeine articles by
vertue wherof certeine places in Northumberland were restored vnto
Malcolme which he had held in William Conquerours daies Some other
write in like maner that king Malcolme did homage to king William and
duke Robert that brought the said Edgar Etheling into the fauour of
the king
Howsoeuer the truth of the storie dooth stand in this behalfe
certeine it is that the king returned out of Northumberland into the
west parts of the realme reteining still with him duke Robert who
looked dailie when he should performe such couenants as were concluded
vpon betwixt them in their late reconciliation But when he saw that
the king meant nothing lesse than to stand to those articles and how
he did onlie protract and delaie the time for some other secret
purpose he returned into Normandie in great displeasure and tooke
with him the said Edgar Etheling of whom he alwaies made verie great
account Sidenote The repairing and new peopling of Carleil Soone
after king William returned into the north parts and as it chanced
he staied a few daies about Carleil where being delited with the
situation of the towne which had beene destroied by the Danes two
hundred yeares before he set workemen to repaire the same meaning to
vse it in steed of a bulworke against the Scots on those west borders
which when he had fensed with walles and builded a castell in the
most conuenient place thereof he caused churches and houses to be
erected for the benefit of such people as he had determined to bring
vnto the same This being doone he placed a colonie of southren men
there with their wiues and children and gaue large priuileges vnto the
towne which they inioy at this daie
Sidenote Matth West  Here haue I thought good to aduertise you
of an error in Matth West crept in either through misplacing the
matter by means of some exemplifier either else by the authors
mistaking his account of yeares as 1072 for 1092 referring the
repairing of Carleil vnto William Conquerour at what time he made a
iournie against the Scots in the said yeare 1072 And yet not thus
contented to bewraie the error more manifestlie he affirmeth that
the king exchanged the earledome of Chester with Rafe or Ranulfe de
Micenis alias Meschines for the earledome of Carleil which the said
Meschines held before and had begunne there to build and fortifie
that towne whereas it is certeine that Ranulfe de Meschines came to
enioy the earledome of Chester by way of inheritance as after shall
appeare For better proofe whereof ye shall vnderstand that we find
by ancient records how one Hugh Lou or Lupus enioied the earledome of
Chester all the daies of the Conqueror and long after which Hugh was
sonne to Richard earle of Auranges and the countesse Emma daughter of
a noble man in Normandie named Herlowin who maried Arlet the daughter
of a burgesse in Falois and mother to William Conquerour So that the
said Hugh being sisters sonne to the Conqueror receiued by gift at
his hands the earledome of Chester to hold of him as freelie by right
of the sword as he held the realme of England in title of his crowne
For these be the words Tenendum sibi  hredibus ita libere ad
gladium sicut ipse Rex totam tenebat Angliam ad coronam
Earle Hugh then established in possession of this earledome with most
large priuileges and freedoms for the better gouernement thereof
ordeined vnder him foure barons Sidenote Foure barons Nigell or
Neal Piers Malbanke  Eustace whose surname we find not Warren
Vernon namelie his cousine Nigell or Neal baron of Halton sir
Piers Malbanke baron of Nauntwich sir Eustace  baron of Mawpasse
and sir Warren Uernon baron of Shipbrooke Nigell held his baronie of
Halton by seruice to lead the Uauntgard of the earles armie when he
should make anie iournie into Wales so as he should be the foremost
in marching into the enimies countrie and the last in comming backe
he was also conestable and Marshall of Chester Sidenote The
Lacies From this Nigell or Neal the Lacies that were earles of
Lincolne had their originall When earle Hugh had gouerned the
earledome of Chester the terme of 40 yeares he departed this life
in the yeare 1107 He had issue by his wife Armetrida Richard the
second earle of Chester after the conquest Robert abbat of Saint
Edmundsburie and Otnell tutor to the children of king Henrie the
first Sidenote Iohn Bohun Moreouer the said earle Hugh had a
sister named Margaret that was maried to John Bohun who had issue by
hir Ranulfe Bohun otherwise called Meschines which Ranulfe by that
meanes came to enioy the earledome of Chester in right of his mother
after that earle Richard was drowned in the sea and not by exchange
for the earledome of Carleil as by this which we haue alreadie
recited may sufficientlie be prooued
Sidenote An Reg 6 Now to returne where we left After that king
William Rufus had giuen order for the building fortifieng and
peopling of Carleil he returned southwards and came to Glocester
where he fell into a greeuous and dangerous sicknesse Sidenote
1093 so that he was in despaire and doubt of his life Sidenote
Simon Dun Hen Hunt Matth Paris The king being sicke
promiseth amendment of life Polydor Eadmerus wherefore he
repented him of his former misdeeds and promised if he escaped that
dangerous sicknesse to amend and become a new man But when he had
his health that promise was quickelie broken for his dooings which
were so bad and wicked before his sicknesse being compared with those
which followed after his recouerie might haue beene reputed good and
sufferable
Sidenote Anselme elected archbishop of Canturburie Moreouer
whereas he reteined and kept in his hands the bishoprike of
Canturburie the space of foure yeares he now bestowed it vpon
Anselme who was before abbat of Bechellouin in Normandie and for
certeine abbeis which he had held long time in his possession he
ordeined abbats by meane wherof all men but especiallie the
spiritualtie began to conceiue a verie good opinion of him
Sidenote Eadmerus The yere wherein Anselme was thus elected was
from the birth of our Sauiour 1093 on the sixt of March being the
first sundaie in Lent as Eadmerus recordeth Sidenote Matth
Paris Polydor Robert Bluet L Chancelor elected bishop of
Lincolne Furthermore he gaue the see of Lincolne being void by the
death of Bishop Remigius to his councellour Robert Bluet but
afterward repenting himselfe of such liberalitie in that he had not
kept it longer in his hands towards the inriching of his coffers he
deuised a shift how to wipe the bishops nose of some of his gold
which he performed after this maner He caused the bishop to be sued
quarelinglie charging him that he had wrongfullie vsurped certeine
possessions togither with the citie of Lincolne which appertained to
the see of Yorke Sidenote Hen Hunt Which although it was but a
forged cauillation and a shamefull vntruth yet could not the bishop
be deliuered out of that trouble till he had paid to the king fiue
thousand pounds And as he dealt with the spiritualtie so he caused
diuerse of the Nobilitie to be put to greeuous fines for
transgressing of his lawes though the fault were neuer so little He
also caused the archbishop Anselme to paie him a great summe of monie
vnder colour of a contribution which was due in Lanfrankes daies
though it was certeinlie knowne that Lanfranke had paied it Thus grew
king William from time to time more sharpe and rigorous to his
subiects so that whosoeuer came within the danger of the laws was
sure to be condemned and such as would plaie the promooters and giue
informations against any man for transgressing the lawes were highlie
rewarded
In this sixt yeare there chanced such an excessiue raine and such high
flouds the riuers ouerflowing the low grounds that lay neere vnto them
as the like had not beene seene of many yeares before and afterwards
insued a sudden frost whereby the great streames were congeled in such
sort that at their dissoluing or thawing manie bridges both of wood
and stone were borne downe and diuerse watermilles rent vp and caried
awaie
Sidenote Polydor Furthermore king William perceiuing that by his
cruell and couetous gouernment sundrie of his subiects did dailie
steale out of the realme Sidenote A proclamation that none should
depart the realme to liue in forreine countries he published a
proclamation charging that no man should depart the realme without
his licence and safeconduct Hereof it is thought that the custome
rose of forbidding passage out of the realme which oftentimes is vsed
as a law when occasion serueth Soone after he went against the
Welshmen whom he vanquished in battell neere to Brecknocke and slue
Rees their king who had doone much hurt within the English borders
when he was their incamped Sidenote Ran Higd Rees king of Wales
slaine This Rise or Rees was the last king that reigned ouer the
Welshmen as authors affirme for afterwards though they oftentimes
rebelled yet the kings of England were reputed and taken as supreme
gouernors of that part of the Iland Sidenote Wil Thorne
Moreouer to haue the countrie the better in quiet he did cut downe
their woods and builded manie castels and piles in places conuenient
by meanes whereof they were somewhat tamed and trained in due time to
obedience though not at the first nor in the daies of sundrie of his
successors
Sidenote Malcolme king of Scots commeth to Glocester Wil Malm
Polydor Hauing thus finished his iournie into Wales Malcolme king
of Scotland came vnto Glocester to see the king and to common with
him of sundrie matters touching the peace betwixt both the realms as
he returned homewards but bicause king William disdained to
enterteine him in such pompous maner as he expected and made account
of Sidenote K Malcolme inuadeth England and forsomuch as he did
not at the verie first admit him to his presence the said Malcolme
returned into Scotland in great displeasure and immediatelie raising
