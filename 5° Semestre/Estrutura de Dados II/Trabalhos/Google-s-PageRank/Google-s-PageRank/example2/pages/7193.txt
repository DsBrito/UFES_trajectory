Youu TOM
There was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to
seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight
There I might a thought of that closet What you been doing in
there
Nothing
Nothing Look at your hands And look at your mouth What IS that
truck
I dont know aunt
Well I know Its jamthats what it is Forty times Ive said if
you didnt let that jam alone Id skin you Hand me that switch
The switch hovered in the airthe peril was desperate
My Look behind you aunt
The old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger The
lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high boardfence and
disappeared over it
His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle
laugh
Hang the boy cant I never learn anything Aint he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time But old
fools is the biggest fools there is Cant learn an old dog new tricks
as the saying is But my goodness he never plays them alike two days
and how is a body to know whats coming He pears to know just how
long he can torment me before I get my dander up and he knows if he
can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all down
again and I cant hit him a lick I aint doing my duty by that boy
and thats the Lords truth goodness knows Spare the rod and spile
the child as the Good Book says Im a laying up sin and suffering for
us both I know Hes full of the Old Scratch but lawsame hes my
own dead sisters boy poor thing and I aint got the heart to lash
him somehow Every time I let him off my conscience does hurt me so
and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks Wellawell man
that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the
Scripture says and I reckon its so Hell play hookey this evening
and  Southwestern for afternoon Ill just be obleeged to make him
work tomorrow to punish him Its mighty hard to make him work
Saturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work more
than he hates anything else and Ive GOT to do some of my duty by him
or Ill be the ruination of the child
Tom did play hookey and he had a very good time He got back home
barely in season to help Jim the small colored boy saw nextdays
wood and split the kindlings before supperat least he was there in
time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did threefourths of the
work Toms younger brother or rather halfbrother Sid was already
through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a
quiet boy and had no adventurous troublesome ways
While Tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile and
very deepfor she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments Like
many other simplehearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning Said she
Tom it was middling warm in school warnt it
Yesm
Powerful warm warnt it
Yesm
Didnt you want to go in aswimming Tom
A bit of a scare shot through Toma touch of uncomfortable suspicion
He searched Aunt Pollys face but it told him nothing So he said
Nomwell not very much
The old lady reached out her hand and felt Toms shirt and said
But you aint too warm now though And it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind But in spite of her Tom knew
where the wind lay now So he forestalled what might be the next move
Some of us pumped on our headsmines damp yet See
Aunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence and missed a trick Then she had a new
inspiration
Tom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it to
pump on your head did you Unbutton your jacket
The trouble vanished out of Toms face He opened his jacket His
shirt collar was securely sewed
Bother Well go long with you Id made sure youd played hookey
and been aswimming But I forgive ye Tom I reckon youre a kind of a
singed cat as the saying isbettern you look THIS time
She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that Tom
had stumbled into obedient conduct for once
But Sidney said
Well now if I didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread
but its black
Why I did sew it with white Tom
But Tom did not wait for the rest As he went out at the door he said
Siddy Ill lick you for that
In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into
the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about themone needle
carried white thread and the other black He said
Shed never noticed if it hadnt been for Sid Confound it sometimes
she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black I wish to
geeminy shed stick to one or totherI cant keep the run of em But
I bet you Ill lam Sid for that Ill learn him
He was not the Model Boy of the village He knew the model boy very
well thoughand loathed him
Within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles
Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him
than a mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore
them down and drove them out of his mind for the timejust as mens
misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises This
new interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just
acquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed
It consisted in a peculiar birdlike turn a sort of liquid warble
produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short
intervals in the midst of the musicthe reader probably remembers how
to do it if he has ever been a boy Diligence and attention soon gave
him the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full
of harmony and his soul full of gratitude He felt much as an
astronomer feels who has discovered a new planetno doubt as far as
strong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with
the boy not the astronomer
The summer evenings were long It was not dark yet Presently Tom
checked his whistle A stranger was before hima boy a shade larger
than himself A newcomer of any age or either sex was an impressive
curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St Petersburg This boy
was well dressed toowell dressed on a weekday This was simply
astounding His cap was a dainty thing his closebuttoned blue cloth
roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons He had shoes
onand it was only Friday He even wore a necktie a bright bit of
ribbon He had a citified air about him that ate into Toms vitals The
more Tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his
nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed
to him to grow Neither boy spoke If one moved the other movedbut
only sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all
the time Finally Tom said
I can lick you
Id like to see you try it
Well I can do it
No you cant either
Yes I can
No you cant
I can
You cant
Can
Cant
An uncomfortable pause Then Tom said
Whats your name
Tisnt any of your business maybe
Well I low Ill MAKE it my business
Well why dont you
If you say much I will
MuchmuchMUCH There now
Oh you think youre mighty smart DONT you I could lick you with
one hand tied behind me if I wanted to
Well why dont you DO it You SAY you can do it
Well I WILL if you fool with me
Oh yesIve seen whole families in the same fix
Smarty You think youre SOME now DONT you Oh what a hat
You can lump that hat if you dont like it I dare you to knock it
offand anybody thatll take a dare will suck eggs
Youre a liar
Youre another
Youre a fighting liar and dasnt take it up
Awtake a walk
Sayif you give me much more of your sass Ill take and bounce a
rock offn your head
Oh of COURSE you will
Well I WILL
Well why dont you DO it then What do you keep SAYING you will for
Why dont you DO it Its because youre afraid
I AINT afraid
You are
I aint
You are
Another pause and more eying and sidling around each other Presently
they were shoulder to shoulder Tom said
Get away from here
Go away yourself
I wont
I wont either
So they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and
both shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with
hate But neither could get an advantage After struggling till both
were hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution
and Tom said
Youre a coward and a pup Ill tell my big brother on you and he
can thrash you with his little finger and Ill make him do it too
What do I care for your big brother Ive got a brother thats bigger
than he isand whats more he can throw him over that fence too
Both brothers were imaginary
Thats a lie
YOUR saying so dont make it so
Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said
I dare you to step over that and Ill lick you till you cant stand
up Anybody thatll take a dare will steal sheep
The new boy stepped over promptly and said
Now you said youd do it now lets see you do it
Dont you crowd me now you better look out
Well you SAID youd do itwhy dont you do it
By jingo for two cents I WILL do it
The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out
with derision Tom struck them to the ground In an instant both boys
were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and
for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair and
clothes punched and scratched each others nose and covered
themselves with dust and glory Presently the confusion took form and
through the fog of battle Tom appeared seated astride the new boy and
pounding him with his fists Holler nuff said he
The boy only struggled to free himself He was cryingmainly from rage
Holler nuffand the pounding went on
At last the stranger got out a smothered Nuff and Tom let him up
and said
Now thatll learn you Better look out who youre fooling with next
time
The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing
snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and
threatening what he would do to Tom the next time he caught him out
To which Tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather and
as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw
it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like
an antelope Tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where he
lived He then held a position at the gate for some time daring the
enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the
window and declined At last the enemys mother appeared and called
Tom a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away So he went
away but he said he lowed to lay for that boy
He got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in
at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt
and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn
his Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in
its firmness
CHAPTER II
SATURDAY morning was come and all the summer world was bright and
fresh and brimming with life There was a song in every heart and if
the heart was young the music issued at the lips There was cheer in
every face and a spring in every step The locusttrees were in bloom
and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air Cardiff Hill beyond
the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far
enough away to seem a Delectable Land dreamy reposeful and inviting
Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a
longhandled brush He surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and
a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit Thirty yards of board
fence nine feet high Life to him seemed hollow and existence but a
burden Sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost
plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant
whitewashed streak with the farreaching continent of unwhitewashed
fence and sat down on a treebox discouraged Jim came skipping out at
the gate with a tin pail and singing Buffalo Gals Bringing water from
the town pump had always been hateful work in Toms eyes before but
now it did not strike him so He remembered that there was company at
the pump White mulatto and negro boys and girls were always there
waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling
fighting skylarking And he remembered that although the pump was only
a hundred and fifty yards off Jim never got back with a bucket of
water under an hourand even then somebody generally had to go after
him Tom said
Say Jim Ill fetch the water if youll whitewash some
Jim shook his head and said
Cant Mars Tom Ole missis she tole me I got to go an git dis
water an not stop foolin roun wid anybody She say she spec Mars
Tom gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend
to my own businessshe lowed SHED tend to de whitewashin
Oh never you mind what she said Jim Thats the way she always
talks Gimme the bucketI wont be gone only a a minute SHE wont
ever know
Oh I dasnt Mars Tom Ole missis shed take an tar de head offn
me Deed she would
SHE She never licks anybodywhacks em over the head with her
thimbleand who cares for that Id like to know She talks awful but
talk dont hurtanyways it dont if she dont cry Jim Ill give you
a marvel Ill give you a white alley
Jim began to waver
White alley Jim And its a bully taw
My Dats a mighty gay marvel I tell you But Mars Tom Is powerful
fraid ole missis
And besides if you will Ill show you my sore toe
Jim was only humanthis attraction was too much for him He put down
his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound In another moment he was
flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear Tom was
whitewashing with vigor and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field
with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye
But Toms energy did not last He began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied Soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to workthe very
thought of it burnt him like fire He got out his worldly wealth and
examined itbits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an
exchange of WORK maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an
hour of pure freedom So he returned his straitened means to his
pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys At this dark
and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him Nothing less than a
great magnificent inspiration
He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work Ben Rogers hove in
sight presentlythe very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had been
dreading Bens gait was the hopskipandjumpproof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high He was eating an apple and
giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deeptoned
dingdongdong dingdongdong for he was personating a steamboat As
he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious
pomp and circumstancefor he was personating the Big Missouri and
considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water He was boat and
captain and enginebells combined so he had to imagine himself
standing on his own hurricanedeck giving the orders and executing them
Stop her sir Tingalingling The headway ran almost out and he
drew up slowly toward the sidewalk
Ship up to back Tingalingling His arms straightened and
stiffened down his sides
Set her back on the stabboard Tingalingling Chow chchowwow
Chow His right hand meantime describing stately circlesfor it was
representing a fortyfoot wheel
Let her go back on the labboard Tingalingling Chowchchowchow
The left hand began to describe circles
Stop the stabboard Tingalingling Stop the labboard Come ahead

Tingalingling Chowowow Get out that headline LIVELY now
Comeout with your springlinewhatre you about there Take a turn
round that stump with the bight of it Stand by that stage nowlet her

trying the gaugecocks
Tom went on whitewashingpaid no attention to the steamboat Ben
stared a moment and then said HiYI YOURE up a stump aint you
No answer Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then
he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as
before Ben ranged up alongside of him Toms mouth watered for the
apple but he stuck to his work Ben said
Hello old chap you got to work hey
Tom wheeled suddenly and said
Why its you Ben I warnt noticing
SayIm going in aswimming I am Dont you wish you could But of
course youd druther WORKwouldnt you Course you would
Tom contemplated the boy a bit and said
What do you call work
Why aint THAT work
Tom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly
Well maybe it is and maybe it aint All I know is it suits Tom
Sawyer
Oh come now you dont mean to let on that you LIKE it
The brush continued to move
Like it Well I dont see why I oughtnt to like it Does a boy get
a chance to whitewash a fence every day
That put the thing in a new light Ben stopped nibbling his apple Tom
swept his brush daintily back and forthstepped back to note the
effectadded a touch here and therecriticised the effect againBen
watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more
absorbed Presently he said
Say Tom let ME whitewash a little
Tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mind
NonoI reckon it wouldnt hardly do Ben You see Aunt Pollys
awful particular about this fenceright here on the street you know
but if it was the back fence I wouldnt mind and SHE wouldnt Yes
shes awful particular about this fence its got to be done very
careful I reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two
thousand that can do it the way its got to be done
Nois that so Oh come nowlemme just try Only just a littleId
let YOU if you was me Tom
Ben Id like to honest injun but Aunt Pollywell Jim wanted to
do it but she wouldnt let him Sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt
let Sid Now dont you see how Im fixed If you was to tackle this
fence and anything was to happen to it
Oh shucks Ill be just as careful Now lemme try SayIll give
you the core of my apple
Well hereNo Ben now dont Im afeard
Ill give you ALL of it
Tom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his
heart And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in
the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by
dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more
innocents There was no lack of material boys happened along every
little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash By the time
Ben was fagged out Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for
a kite in good repair and when he played out Johnny Miller bought in
for a dead rat and a string to swing it withand so on and so on
hour after hour And when the middle of the afternoon came from being
a poor povertystricken boy in the morning Tom was literally rolling
in wealth He had besides the things before mentioned twelve marbles
part of a jewsharp a piece of blue bottleglass to look through a
spool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk
a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six
firecrackers a kitten with only one eye a brass doorknob a
dogcollarbut no dogthe handle of a knife four pieces of
orangepeel and a dilapidated old window sash
He had had a nice good idle time all the whileplenty of company
and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it If he hadnt run out
of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village
Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all He
had discovered a great law of human action without knowing itnamely
that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only
necessary to make the thing difficult to attain If he had been a great
and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have
comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do
and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do And
this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers
or performing on a treadmill is work while rolling tenpins or
climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement There are wealthy gentlemen in
England who drive fourhorse passengercoaches twenty or thirty miles
on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them
considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service
that would turn it into work and then they would resign
The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to
report
CHAPTER III
TOM presented himself before Aunt Polly who was sitting by an open
window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom
breakfastroom diningroom and library combined The balmy summer
air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur
of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting
for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap Her
spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety She had thought
that of course Tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him
place himself in her power again in this intrepid way He said Maynt
I go and play now aunt
What aready How much have you done
Its all done aunt
Tom dont lie to meI cant bear it
I aint aunt it IS all done
Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence She went out to see
for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent
of Toms statement true When she found the entire fence whitewashed
and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even
a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable
She said
Well I never Theres no getting round it you can work when youre
a mind to Tom And then she diluted the compliment by adding But
its powerful seldom youre a mind to Im bound to say Well go long
and play but mind you get back some time in a week or Ill tan you
She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took
him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to
him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a
treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort
And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish he hooked a
doughnut
Then he skipped out and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor Clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling They raged around Sid like a
hailstorm and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect
and Tom was over the fence and gone There was a gate but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it His soul was at
peace now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble
Tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by
the back of his aunts cowstable He presently got safely beyond the
reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square
of the village where two military companies of boys had met for
conflict according to previous appointment Tom was General of one of
these armies Joe Harper a bosom friend General of the other These
two great commanders did not condescend to fight in personthat being
better suited to the still smaller frybut sat together on an eminence
and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through
aidesdecamp Toms army won a great victory after a long and
hardfought battle Then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged
the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the
necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and
marched away and Tom turned homeward alone
As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived he saw a new
girl in the gardena lovely little blueeyed creature with yellow hair
plaited into two longtails white summer frock and embroidered
pantalettes The freshcrowned hero fell without firing a shot A
certain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a
memory of herself behind He had thought he loved her to distraction
he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor
little evanescent partiality He had been months winning her she had
confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest
boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time
she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is
done
He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she
had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present
and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order to
win her admiration He kept up this grotesque foolishness for some
time but byandby while he was in the midst of some dangerous
gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl
was wending her way toward the house Tom came up to the fence and
leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer
She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door Tom
heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold But his face
lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment
before she disappeared
The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and
then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if
he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction
Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his
nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side
in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally
his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he
hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner But
only for a minuteonly while he could button the flower inside his
jacket next his heartor next his stomach possibly for he was not
much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway
He returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing
off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though Tom
comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some
window meantime and been aware of his attentions Finally he strode
home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions
All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered
what had got into the child He took a good scolding about clodding
Sid and did not seem to mind it in the least He tried to steal sugar
under his aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it He said
Aunt you dont whack Sid when he takes it
Well Sid dont torment a body the way you do Youd be always into
that sugar if I warnt watching you
Presently she stepped into the kitchen and Sid happy in his
immunity reached for the sugarbowla sort of glorying over Tom which
was wellnigh unbearable But Sids fingers slipped and the bowl dropped
and broke Tom was in ecstasies In such ecstasies that he even
controlled his tongue and was silent He said to himself that he would
not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly
still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and
