CHAPTER I
Philips Arrival in New York
Tis not the practice of writers to choose for biography men who have
made no more noise in the world than Captain Winwood has nor the act
of gentlemen in ordinary cases to publish such private matters as
this recital will present But I consider on the one hand that
Winwoods history contains as much of interest and as good an example
of manly virtues as will be found in the life of many a hero more
renowned and on the other that his story has been so partially
known and so distorted it becomes indeed the duty of a gentleman
when that gentleman was his nearest friend to put forth that story
truly and so give the lie for ever to the detractors of a brave and
kindly man
There was a saying in the American army proceeding first from Major
Harry Lee of their famous Light Horse that Captain Winwood was in
America in the smaller way his modesty permitted what the Chevalier
Bayard was in France and Sir Philip Sidney in England This has been
received more than once such is the malice of conscious inferiority
with derisive smiles or supercilious sneers and not only by certain
of his own countrymen but even in my presence when my friendship for
Winwood though I had been his rival in love and his enemy in war was
not less known than was my quickness to take offence and avenge it I
dealt with one such case at the hour of dawn in a glade near the
Bowery lane a little way out of New York And I might have continued
to vindicate my friends character so either with pistols as at
Weehawken across the Hudson soon after the war I vindicated the
motives of us Englishmen of American birth who stood for the king in
the war of Independence or with rapiers as I defended the name of
our admired enemy Washington against a certain defamer one morning
in Hyde Park after I had come to London But it has occurred to me
that I can better serve Winwoods reputation by the spilling of ink
with a quill than of blood with a sword or pistol This consideration
which is far from a desire to compete with the young gentlemen who
strive for farthings and fame in Grub Street is my apology for
profaning with my unskilled hand the implement ennobled by the use of
a Johnson and a Goldsmith a Fielding and an Addison
My acquaintance with the Captains life from the vantage of an
eyewitness and comrade goes back to the time when all of us
concerned were children to the very day in truth when Philip a
pale and slender lad of eleven years first set foot in New York and
first set eye on Margaret Faringfield
As I think of it it seems but yesterday and myself a boy again but
it was in fact in the year 1763 and late in the afternoon of a
sunny Summer day I remember well how thick and heavy the green leaves
hung upon the trees that thrust their branches out over the garden
walls and fences of our quiet street
Tired from a days play or perchance lazy from the heat I sprawled
upon the front step of our house which was next the residence of the
Faringfields in what was then called Queen Street I believe the name
of that as of many another in New York has been changed since the
war having savoured too much of royalty for republican taste1 The
Faringfield house like the family was one of the finest in New York
and there were in that young city greater mansions than one would have
thought to find in a little colonial seaporta rurallooking
provincial place truly which has been likened to a Dutch town almost
wholly transformed into the semblance of some secondary English town
or into a tiny faroff imitation of London It lacked of course the
grand gray churches the palaces and historic places that tell of
what a past has been Londons but it lacked too the begriming smoke
and fog that are too much of Londons present Indeed never had any
town a clearer sky or brighter sunshine than are New Yorks
From the Summer power of this sunshine our part of Queen Street was
sheltered by the trees of gardens and open spaces maple oak
chestnut linden locust willow what not There was a garden
wherein the breeze sighed all day between our house and the
Faringfield mansion to which it pertained That vast house of red
and yellow brick was two stories and a garret high and had a
doublysloping roof pierced with dormer windows The mansions lower
windows and wide front door were framed with carved woodwork painted
white Its garden gate like its front door opened directly to the
street and in the garden gateway as I lounged on our front step that
Summer evening Madge Faringfield stood running her fingers through
the thick white and brown hair of her huge dog at her side
The dogs head was almost on a level with hers for she was then but
eight years old a very bright and pretty child She turned her quick
glance down the street as she stood and saw me lying so lazy and at
once her gray eyes took on a teasing and deriding light and I felt I
was in for some ironical quizzing speech or other But just then her
look fell upon something farther down the way toward Hanover Square
and lingered in a halfamused kind of curiosity I directed my own
gaze to see what possessed hers and this is what we both beheld
together little guessing what the years to come should bring to make
that moment memorable in our minds
A thin but wellformed boy of eleven with a pleasant kindly face
somewhat too white in which there was a lookas there was evidence
in his walk alsoof his being tired from prolonged exertion or
endurance He was decently though not expensively clad in black
cloth his threecornered felt hat wideskirted coat and illfitting
kneebreeches being all of the same solemn hue I was to perceive
later that his clothes were old and carefully mended His gray silk
stockings ill accorded with his poor shoes of which the buckles were
of steel He carried in one hand a large ancient travellingbag so
heavy that it strained his muscles and dragged him down thus partly
explaining the fatigued look in his face and in his other hand a
basket from the open top of which there appeared thrust out the
head of a live gray kitten
This pretty animals look of strangeness to its surroundings as it
gazed about with curiosity would alone have proclaimed that it was
arrived from travel had not the baggage and appearance of its bearer
told the same story The boy also kept an alert eye forward as he
advanced up the street but it was soon evident that he gazed in
search of some particular object This object as the lad finally
satisfied himself by scanning it and its neighbours twice over proved
to be the house immediately opposite ours It was one of a row of
small old brick residences with Dutch gable ends toward the street
Having made sure of its identity and having reddened a little at the
gaze of Madge and me the young stranger set down his bag with
perceptible signs of physical relief and keeping in his grasp the
basket with the cat knocked with a seemingly forced boldnessas if
he were conscious of timidity to be overcomeupon the door
At that Madge Faringfield could not help laughing aloud
It was a light rippling little laugh entirely goodnatured lasting
but a moment But it sufficed to make the boy turn and look at her and
blush again as if he were hurt but bore no resentment
Then I who knew what it was to be wounded by a girls laugh
especially Madges thought it time to explain and called out to the
lad
Theres nobody at home there
The boy gazed at me at a loss then plainly reluctant to believe me
he once more inspected the blank closed front of the house for
denial or confirmation of my word When he next looked back at me the
expression of inquiring helplessness and vague alarm on his face as
if the earth were giving way beneath his feet was half comical half
pitiful to see
It is Mr Aitkens house is it not he asked in a tone low and
civil though it seemed to betray a rapid beating of the heart after a
sudden sinking thereof
It was I replied but he has gone back to England and that house
is empty
The lads dismay now became complete yet it appeared in no other way
than in the forlorn expression of his sharp pale countenance and in
the unconscious appeal with which his blue eyes surveyed Madge and me
in turn But in a few moments he collected himself as if for the
necessary dealing with some unexpected castastrophe and asked me a
little huskily still
When will he come home
Never to this house I think Another customs officer has come over
in his place but this one lodges at the Kings Arms because hes a
bachelor
The lad cast a final hopeless glance at the house and then
mechanically took a folded letter from an inner pocket and dismally
regarded the name on the back
I had a letter for him he said presently looking again across the
street at me and Madge for the curious Miss Faringfield had walked
down from her gateway to my side that she might view the stranger
better And now she spoke in her fearless goodhumoured somewhat
forward way
If you will give the letter to me my father will send it to Mr
Aitken in London
Thank you but that would be of no use said the lad with a
disconsolate smile
Why not cried Madge promptly and started forthwith skipping across
the dusty street I followed and in a moment we two were quite close
to the newcomer
Youre tired said Madge not waiting for his answer Why dont you
sit down And she pointed to the steps of the vacant house
Thank you said the lad but with a bow and a gesture that meant he
would not sit while a lady stood albeit the ladys age was but eight
years
Madge pleased at this smiled and perched herself on the upper step
Waiting to be assured that I preferred standing the newcomer then
seated himself on his own travellingbag an involuntary sigh of
comfort showing how welcome was this rest
Did you come to visit in New York at once began the inquisitive
Madge
Yes II came to see Mr Aitken was the hesitating and dubious
answer
And so youll have to go back home without seeing him
I dont very well see how I can go back said the boy slowly
Oh then you will visit some one else or stay at the tavern Madge
went on
I dont know any one else here was the reply and I cant stay at
the tavern
Why then what will you do
I dont knowyet the lad answered looking the picture of
loneliness
Where do you live I put in
I did live in Philadelphia but I left there the other day by the
stagecoach and arrived just now in New York by the boat
And why cant you go back there I continued
Why becauseI had just money enough left to pay my way to New
York and even if I should walk back Ive no place there to go back
to and no one at allnow He broke off here his voice faltering
and his blue eyes filled with moisture But he made a swallow and
checked the tears and sat gently stroking the head of his kitten
For a little time none of us spoke while I stood staring somewhat
abashed at the lads evident emotion Madge studied his countenance
intently and doubtless used her imagination to suppose little
Tomher younger and favourite brotherin this strangers place
Whatever it was that impelled her she suddenly said to him Wait
here and turning ran back across the street and disappeared
through the garden gate
Instead of following her the dog went up to the new boys cat and
sniffed at its nose causing it to whisk back its head and gaze
spellbound To show his peaceful mind the dog wagged his tail and by
degrees so won the kittens confidence that it presently put forth its
face again and exchanged sniffs
I should think youd have a dog instead of a cat said I
considering the strangers sex
He answered nothing to this but looked quite affectionately at his
pet I set it down as odd that so manly a lad should so openly show
liking for a cat The conduct of the animal in its making acquaintance
with the dog the goodhumoured assurance of the one and the cautious
coyness of the other amused us till presently Madges voice was
heard and then we saw her coming from the garden speaking to her
father who walked bareheaded beside her Behind at a little
distance came Madges mother and little Tom All four stopped at the
gateway and looked curiously toward us
Come over here boy called Madge and heeded not the reproof her
mother instantly gave her in an undertone for her forwardness For any
one of his children but Madge reproof would have come from her father
also in all save where she was concerned he was a singularly correct
and dignified man to the point of stiffness and austerity His wife
a pretty vain inoffensive woman was always chiding her children for
their smaller faults and never seeing the traits that might lead to
graver ones
Mr and Mrs Faringfield awaited the effect of Madges invitation or
rather command adding nothing to it The boys colour showed his
diffidence under the scrutiny of so many coldly inquiring eyes but
after a moment he rose and I with greater quickness seized his bag
by the handle and started across the street with it He called out a
surprised and grateful Thank you and followed me I was speedily
glad I had not undertaken to carry the bag as far as he had done
twas all I could do to bear it
How is this lad said Mr Faringfield when the boy with hat off
stood before him The tone was stern enough a stranger would have
thought though it was indeed a kindly one for Madges father You
have come from Philadelphia to visit Mr Aitken Is he your relation
No sir he was a friend of my fathers before my father came to
America replied the lad in a low respectful voice
Yet your father did not know he was gone back to England How is
that
My father is dead sir he died six years ago
Oh I see replied Mr Faringfield a little taken down from his
severity And the letter my little girl tells me of
If you please my mother wrote it sir said the boy looking at the
letter in his hand his voice trembling a little He seemed to think
from the manner of the Faringfields that he was obliged to give a
full account of himself and so went on She didnt know what else to
do about me sir as there was no one in Philadelphiathat is I
mean she remembered what a friend Mr Aitken was to my fatherthey
were both of Oxford sir Magdalen college And so at last she thought
of sending me to him that he might get me a place or something and
she wrote the letter to tell him who I was and she saw to it that I
should have money enough to come to New York
But I dont understand interrupted Mr Faringfield frowning his
disapproval of something What made it necessary for her to dispose
of you Was she going to marry again
She was going to die sir replied the boy in a reserved tone
which despite his bashfulness both showed his own hurt and rebuked
his elders thoughtless question
Poor boy whispered Mrs Faringfield grasping her little Toms
hand
Oh said her husband slowly slightly awed from his sternness I
beg your pardon my lad I am very sorry indeed Your being here
then means that you are now an orphan
Yes sir was the boys only answer and he lowered his eyes toward
his kitten and so sad and lonely an expression came into his face
that no wonder Mrs Faringfield whispered again Poor lad and even
Madge and little Tom looked solemn
Well boy something must be done about you thats certain said
Mr Faringfield You have no money my daughter says Spent all you
had for cakes and kickshaws in the towns where the stagecoach
stopped Ill warrant
The boy smiled The riding made me hungry sir said he Id have
saved my extra shilling if Id known how it was going to be
But is there nothing coming to you in Philadelphia Did your mother
leave nothing
Everything was sold at auction to pay our debtsit took the books
and our furniture and all to do that
The books
We kept a bookshop sir My father left it to us He was a
bookseller but he was a gentleman and an Oxford man
And he didnt make a fortune at the book trade eh
No sir Ive heard people say he would rather read his books than
sell them
From your studious look I should say you took after him
I do like to read sir the lad admitted quietly smiling again
Here Madge put in with the very belated query
Whats your name
Philip Winwood the boy answered looking at her pleasantly
Well Master Winwood said Madges father we shall have to take
you in overnight at least and then see whats to be done
At this Mrs Faringfield said hastily with a touch of alarm
But my dear is it quite safe The child mightmight have the
measles or something you know
Madge tittered openly and Philip Winwood looked puzzled Mr
Faringfield answered
One can see he is a healthy lad and cleanly though he is tired and
dusty from his journey He may occupy the end garret room Tis an odd
travelling companion you carry my boy Did you bring the cat from
Philadelphia
Yes sir my mother was fond of it and I didnt like to leave it
behind
The kitten drew back from the stately gentlemans attempt to tap its
nose with his finger and evinced a desire to make the acquaintance of
his wife toward whom it put forth its head as far as possible out of
its basket beginning the while to purr
Look mamma it wants to come to you cried little Tom delighted
Cats and dogs always make friends quicker with handsome people said
Philip Winwood with no other intent than merely to utter a fact of
which those who observe the lower animals are well aware
There my dear said Mr Faringfield theres a compliment for you
at my expense
The lady who had laughed to conceal her pleasure at so innocent a
tribute now freely caressed the kitten of which she had been shy
before as if it also might have the measles
Well Philip she said a moment later come in and feel that you
are at home Youll have just time to wash and brush the dust off
before supper He shall occupy the second spare chamber William she
added turning to her husband How could you think of sending so nice
and goodlooking a lad to the garret Leave your travellingbag here
child the servants shall carry it in for you
This is so kind of you maam and sir said Philip with a lump in
his throat and able to speak his gratitude the less because he felt
it the more
I am the one you ought to thank said Madge archly thus calling
forth a reproving Margaret from her mother and an embarrassed
smilepart amusement part thanks part admirationfrom Philip The
smile so pleased Madge that she gave one in return and then actually
dropped her eyes
I saw with a pang that the newcomer was already in love with her and
I knew that the novelty of his adoration would make her oblivious of
my existence for at least a week to come But I bore him no malice
and as the Faringfields turned toward the rear veranda of the house I
said
Come and play with me whenever you like Thats where I live next
door My name is Herbert Russell but they call me Bert for short
Thank you said Winwood and was just about to go down the garden
walk between Madge and little Tom when the whole party was stopped by
a faint boohooing in a soft and timid voice a short distance up the
street
Tis Fanny cried Mrs Faringfield affrightedly and ran out from
the garden to the street
Ned has been bullying her said Madge anger suddenly firing her
pretty face And she too was in the street in a moment followed by
all of us Philip Winwood joining with a ready boyish curiosity and
interest in what concerned his new acquaintances
Sure enough it was Fanny Faringfield Madges younger sister coming
along the street her knuckles in her eyes the tears streaming down
her face and behind her with his fists in his coat pockets and his
cruel sneering laugh on his bold handsome face came Ned the eldest
of the four Faringfield young ones He and Fanny were returning from a
childrens afternoon teaparty at the Wilmots house in William
Street from which entertainment Madge had stayed away because she had
had another quarrel with Ned whom she with her selflove and high
spirit had early learned to hate for his hectoring and domineering
nature I shared Madges feeling there and was usually at daggers
drawn with Ned Faringfield for I never would take any mans
browbeating Doubtless my own quickness of temper was somewhat to
blame I know that it got me into many fights and had in fact kept
me too from that afternoons tea I being then not on speaking terms
with one of the Wilmot boys As for Madges detestation of Ned she
made up for it by her love of little Tom who then and always deserved
it Tom was a true kind honest manly fellow from his cradle to
that sad night outside the Kingsbridge tavern Madge loved Fanny too
but less wholly As for Fanny dear girl she loved them all even
Ned to whom she rendered homage and obedience and to save whom from
their fathers hard wrath she now at sight of us all issuing from
the gateway suddenly stopped crying and tried to look as if nothing
were the matter
Ned seeing his father paled and hesitated but the next moment came
swaggering on his face showing a curious succession of fear
defiance cringing and a crafty hope of lying out of his offence
It was of course the very thing Fanny did to shield him that
certainly betrayed him and when I knew from her sudden change of
conduct that he was indeed to blame I would gladly have attacked him
despite that he was twelve years old and I but ten But I dared not
move in the presence of our elders and moreover I saw at once Neds
father would deal with him to our complete satisfaction
Go to your room sir said Mr Faringfield in his sternest tone
looking his anger out of eyes as hard as steel This meant for Master
Ned no supper and probably much worse
Please sir I didnt do anything answered Ned with illfeigned
surprise She fell and hurt her arm
Fanny did not deny this but she was no liar and could not confirm
it So she looked to the ground and clasped her left wrist with her
right hand But in this latter movement she again exposed her brother
by the very means she took to protect him for quickseeing Madge
observing the action gently but firmly unclasped the younger sisters
hand and so disclosed the telltale marks of Neds fingers upon the
delicate wrist by squeezing or wrenching which that tyrant had
evinced his brotherly superiority
At sight of this Mrs Faringfield gave a low cry of horror and
maternal pity and fell to caressing the bruised wrist and Madge
raising her arm girlwise began to rain blows on her brother which
fell wherever they might but where none of them could hurt Her
father without reproving her drew her quietly back and with a
countenance a shade darker than before pointed out the way for Ned
toward the veranda leading to the rear halldoor
With a vindictive look and pouting lips Ned turned his steps down
the walk Just then he noticed Philip Winwood who had viewed every
detail of the scene with wonder and who now regarded Ned with a kind
of vaguely disliking curiosity such as one bestows on some
sinisterlooking strange animal Philips look was of course
unconscious but none the less clearly to be read for that Ned
Faringfield pausing on his way stared at the unknown lad with an
expression of insolent inquiry Not daring to stay for questions but
observing the valise he seemed to become aware that the newcomer was
an already accepted guest of the house and he thereupon surveyed
Philip a moment inwardly measuring him as a possible comrade or
antagonist but affecting a kind of disdain A look from his father
ended Neds inspection and sent him hastily toward his imprisonment
whither he went with no ones pity but Fannysfor his mother had
become afraid of him and little Tom took his likes and dislikes from
his sister Madge
And so they went in to supper disappearing from my sight behind the
corner of the parlour wing as they mounted the rear veranda Mr and
Mrs Faringfield first the mother leading Fanny by the wounded wrist
the big dog next wagging his tail for no particular reason and then
Philip Winwood with his cat in his basket Madge at one side of him
and pretending an interest in the kitten while from beneath her lashes
she alertly watched the boy himself little Tom on the other side
holding Philips hand I stood at the gateway looking after and with
all my young infatuation for Madge I had no feeling but one of
liking for this quiet strange lad with the pale kind face And I
would to God I might see those three still walking together as when
children through this life that has dealt so strangely with them all
since that Summer evening
CHAPTER II
The Faringfields
Having shown how Philip Winwood came among us I ought to tell at
once though of course I learned it from him afterwards all that need
be known of his previous life His father after leaving Oxford and
studying medicine in Edinburgh had married a lady of the latter city
and emigrated to Philadelphia to practise as a physician But whether
twas that the Quaker metropolis was overstocked with doctors even
then or for other reasons there was little call for Doctor Winwoods
ministrations Moreover he was of so bookloving a disposition that
if he happened to have sat down to a favourite volume and a request
came for his services it irked him exceedingly to respond This being
noticed and getting abroad did not help him in his profession
The birth of Philip adding to the doctors expenses it soon came
about that in the land where he had hoped to make a new fortune he
parted with the last of what fortune he had originally possessed Then
occurred to him the ingenious thought of turning bookseller a
business which far from requiring that he should ever absent himself
from his precious volumes demanded rather that he should always be
among them But the stock that he laid in turned out to comprise
rather such works as a gentleman of learning would choose for company
than such as the people of Philadelphia preferred to read
Furthermore when some wouldbe purchaser appeared it often happened
that the book he offered to buy was one for which the erudite dealer
had acquired so strong an affection that he would not let it change
owners Nor did his wife much endeavour to turn him from this
untradesmanlike course Besides being a gentle and affectionate woman
she had that admiration for learning which like excessive warmth of
heart and certain other traits I have observed to be common between
the Scotch she was of Edinburgh as I have said and the best of the
Americans
Such was Philips father and when he died of some trouble of the
heart there was nothing for his widow to do but continue the
business She did this with more success than the doctor had had
though many a time it smote her heart to sell some book of those that
her husband had loved and to the backs of which she had become
attached for his sake and through years of acquaintance But the
necessities of her little boy and herself cried out and so did the
debt her husband had accumulated as tangible result of his business
career By providing books of a less scholarly more popular
character such as novels sermons plays comic ballads religious
poems and the like as well as by working with her needle and
