preferences of all our plants that with miles of woods and meadows
open to their choice each selects only some few spots for its
accustomed abodes and some one among them all for its very earliest
blossoming There is always some single chosen nook which you might
almost cover with your handkerchief where each flower seems to bloom
earliest without variation year by year I know one such place for
Hepatica a mile northeastanother for Mayflower two miles southwest
and each year the whimsical creature is in bloom on that little spot
when not another flower can be found open through the whole country
round Accidental as the choice may appear it is undoubtedly based
on laws more eternal than the stars yet why all subtile influences
conspire to bless that undistinguishable knoll no man can say Another
and similar puzzle offers itself in the distribution of the tints
of flowersin these two species among the rest There are certain
localities near by where the Hepatica is all but white and others
where the Mayflower is sumptuous in pink yet it is not traceable to
wet or dry sun or shadow and no agricultural chemistry can disclose
the secret Is it by some Darwinian law of selection that the white
Hepatica has utterly overpowered the blue in our Cascade Woods for
instance while yet in the very midst of this pale plantation a single
clump will sometimes bloom with all heaven on its petals Why can one
recognize the Plymouth Mayflower as soon as seen by its wondrous
depth of color Does it blush with triumph to see how Nature has
outwitted the Pilgrims and even succeeded in preserving her deer like
an English duke still maintaining the deepest woods in Massachusetts
precisely where those sturdy immigrants first began their clearings
The Hepatica called also Liverwort SquirrelCup or Blue Anemone has
been found in Worcester as early as March seventeenth and in Danvers on
March twelfthdates which appear almost the extreme of credibility
Our next wildflower in this region is the Claytonia or SpringBeauty
which is common in the Middle States but here found in only a few
localities It is the Indian Miskodeed and was said to have been
left behind when mighty Peboan the Winter was melted by the breath
of Spring It is an exquisitely delicate little creature bears its
blossoms in clusters unlike most of the early species and opens in
gradual succession each white and pinkveined bell It grows in moist
places on the sunny edges of woods and prolongs its shy career from
about the tenth of April until almost the end of May
A week farther into April and the Bloodroot opensa name of guilt
and a type of innocence This fresh and lovely thing appears to
concentrate all its stains within its ensanguined root that it may
condense all purity in the peculiar whiteness of its petals It emerges
from the ground with each shy blossom wrapt in its own palegreen leaf
then doffs the cloak and spreads its long petals round a group of yellow
stamens The flower falls apart so easily that when in full bloom it
will hardly bear transportation but with a touch the stem stands naked
a bare goldtipped sceptre amid drifts of snow And the contradiction
of its hues seems carried into its habits One of the most shy of wild
plants easily banished from its locality by any invasion it yet takes
to the garden with unpardonable readiness doubles its size blossoms
earlier repudiates its love of water and flaunts its great leaves in
the unnatural confinement until it elbows out the exotics Its charm is
gone unless one find it in its native haunts beside some cascade which
streams over rocks that are dark with moisture green with moss and
snowy with white bubbles Each spray of dripping feathermoss exudes a
tiny torrent of its own or braided with some tiny neighbor above the
little waterfonts which sleep sunless in eververdant caves Sometimes
along these emerald canals there comes a sudden rush and hurry as if
some anxious housekeeper upon the hill above were afraid that things
were not stirring fast enoughand then again the waving and sinuous
lines of water are quieted to a serener flow The delicious redthrush
and the busy little yellowthroat are not yet come to this their summer
haunt but all day long the answering fieldsparrows trill out their
sweet shy accelerating lay
In the same localities with the Bloodroot though some days later grows
the DogTooth Violeta name hopelessly inappropriate but likely
never to be changed These hardy and prolific creatures have also
many localities of their own for though they do not acquiesce in
cultivation like the sycophantic Bloodroot yet they are hard to banish
from their native haunts but linger after the woods are cleared and the
meadow drained The bright flowers blaze back all the yellow light of
noonday as the gay petals curl and spread themselves above their beds of
mottled leaves but it is always a disappointment to gather them for
indoors they miss the full ardor of the sunbeams and are apt to go to
sleep and nod expressionless from the stalk
And almost on the same day with this bright apparition one may greet a
multitude of concurrent visitors arriving so accurately together that
it is almost a matter of accident which of the party shall first report
himself Perhaps the Dandelion should have the earliest place indeed
I once found it in Brookline on the seventh of April But it cannot
ordinarily be expected before the twentieth in Eastern Massachusetts
and rather later in the interior while by the same date I have also
found near Boston the Cowslip or MarshMarigold the SpringSaxifrage
the Anemones the Violets the Bellwort the Houstonia the Cinquefoil
and the Strawberryblossom Varying of course in different spots and
years the arrival of this coterie is yet nearly simultaneous and they
may all be expected hereabouts before Mayday at the very latest After
all in spite of the croakers this festival could not have been much
bettertimed the delicate blossoms which mark the period are usually in
perfection on this day and it is not long before they are past their
prime
Some early plants which have now almost disappeared from Eastern
Massachusetts are still found near Worcester in the greatest
abundanceas the larger Yellow Violet the Red Trillium the Dwarf
Ginseng the Clintonia or Wild LilyoftheValley and the pretty
fringed Polygala which Miss Cooper christened GayWings Others again
are now rare in this vicinity and growing rarer though still abundant
a hundred miles farther inland In several bits of old swampy wood one
may still find usually close together the HobbleBush and the Painted
Trillium the Mitella or BishopsCap and the snowy Tiarella Others
again have entirely vanished within ten years and that in some cases
without any adequate explanation The dainty white Corydalis profanely
called DutchmansBreeches and the quaint woolly Ledum or Labrador
Tea have disappeared within that time The beautiful Linnaea is still
found annually but flowers no more as is also the case in all but one
distant locality with the once abundant Rhododendron Nothing in Nature
has for me a more fascinating interest than these secret movements of
vegetationthe sweet blind instinct with which flowers cling to old
domains until absolutely compelled to forsake them How touching is the
fact now well known that saltwater plants still flower beside the
Great Lakes yet dreaming of the time when those waters were briny as
the sea Nothing in the demonstrations of Geology seems grander than the
light lately thrown by Professor Gray from the analogies between the
flora of Japan and of North America upon the successive epochs of heat
which led the wandering flowers along the Arctic lands and of cold
which isolated them once more Yet doubtless these humble movements
of our local plants may be laying up results as important and may
hereafter supply evidence of earths changes upon some smaller scale
May expands to its prime of beauty the summer birds come with the
fruitblossoms the gardens are deluged with bloom and the air with
melody while in the woods the timid springflowers fold themselves away
in silence and give place to a brighter splendor On the margin of some
quiet swamp a myriad of bare twigs seem suddenly overspread with purple
butterflies and we know that the Rhodora is in bloom Wordsworth never
immortalized a flower more surely than Emerson this and it needs no
weaker words there is nothing else in which the change from nakedness
to beauty is so sudden and when you bring home the great mass of
blossoms they appear all ready to flutter away again from your hands and
leave you disenchanted
At the same time the beautiful Corneltree is in perfection startling
as a tree of the tropics it flaunts its great flowers high up among the
forestbranches intermingling its long slender twigs with theirs and
garnishing them with alien blooms It is very available for household
decoration with its four great creamy petalsflowers they are not
but floral involucreseach with a fantastic curl and stain at its tip
as if the fireflies had alighted on them and scorched them and yet I
like it best as it peers out in barbaric splendor from the delicate
green of young Maples And beneath it grows often its more abundant
kinsman the Dwarf Cornel with the same four great petals enveloping
its floral cluster but lingering low upon the groundan herb whose
blossoms mimic the statelier tree
The same rich creamy hue and texture show themselves in the Wild Calla
which grows at this season in dark sequestered watercourses and
sometimes well rivals in all but size that superb whiteness out of
a land of darkness the Ethiopic Calla of the conservatory At this
season too we seek another semiaquatic rarity whose homely name
cannot deprive it of a certain gardenlike elegance the Buckbean This
is one of the shy plants which yet grow in profusion within their own
domain I have found it of old in Cambridge and then upon the pleasant
shallows of the Artichoke that loveliest tributary of the Merrimack
and I have never seen it where it occupied a patch more than a few yards
square while yet within that space the multitudinous spikes grow always
tall and close reminding one of hyacinths when in perfection but more
delicate and beautiful The only locality I know for it in this vicinity
lies seven miles away where a little inlet from the lower winding bays
of Lake Quinsigamond goes stealing up among a farmers hayfields and
there close beside the public road and in full of the farmhouse this
rare creature fills the water But to reach it we commonly row down
the lake to a sheltered lagoon separated from the main lake by a long
island which is gradually forming itself like the coral isles growing
each year denser with alder thickets where the kingbirds buildthere
leave the boat among the lilyleaves and take a lane which winds among
the meadows and gives a fitting avenue for the pretty thing we seek
But it is not safe to vary many days from the twentieth of May for the
plant is not long in perfection and is past its prime when the lower
blossoms begin to wither on the stem
But should we miss this delicate adjustment of time it is easy to
console ourselves with bright armfuls of Lupine which bounteously
flowers for six weeks along our lakeside ranging from the twentythird
of May to the sixth of July The Lupine is one of our most travelled
plants for though never seen off the American continent it stretches
to the Pacific and is found upon the Arctic coast On these banks of
Lake Quinsigamond it grows in great families and should be gathered in
masses and placed in a vase by itself for it needs no relief from other
flowers its own soft leaves afford background enough and though the
white variety rarely occurs yet the varying tints of blue upon the same
stalk are a perpetual gratification to the eye I know not why shaded
blues should be so beautiful in flowers and yet avoided as distasteful
in ladies fancywork but it is a mystery like that which repudiates
blueandgreen from all wellregulated costumes while Nature yet
evidently prefers it to any other combination in her wardrobe
Another constant ornament of the end of May is the large pink
LadysSlipper or MoccasonFlower the Cypripedium not due
till tomorrow which Emerson attributes to the notebook of
Thoreautomorrow in these parts meaning about the twentieth of May
It belongs to the family of Orchids a highbred race fastidious in
habits sensitive as to abodes Of the ten species named as rarest among
American endogenous plants by Dr Gray in his valuable essay on the
statistics of our Northern Flora all but one are Orchids And even an
abundant species like the present retains the family traits in its
person and never loses its highborn air and its delicate veining
I know a grove where it can be gathered by the hundreds within a
halfacre and yet I never can divest myself of the feeling that each
specimen is a choice novelty But the actual rarity occurs at least
in this region when one finds the smaller and more beautiful Yellow
MoccasonFlowerparviflorumwhich accepts only our very choicest
botanical locality the Rattlesnake Ledge on Tatessit Hilland may
for aught I know have been the very plant which Elsie Venner laid upon
her schoolmistresss desk
June is an intermediate month between the spring and summer flowers Of
the more delicate early blossoms the Dwarf Cornel the SolomonsSeal
and the Yellow Violet still linger in the woods but rapidly make way
for larger masses and more conspicuous hues The meadows are gorgeous
with Clover Buttercups and Wild Geranium but Nature is a little chary
for a week or two maturing a more abundant show Meanwhile one
may afford to take some pains to search for another rarity almost
disappearing from this regionthe lovely Pink Azalea It still grows
plentifully in a few sequestered places selecting woody swamps to hide
itself and certainly no shrub suggests when found more tropical
associations Those great nodding airy fragrant clusters tossing far
above ones head their slender cups of honey seem scarcely to belong to
our sober zone any more than the scarlet tanager which sometimes builds
its nest beside them They appear bright exotics which have wandered
into our woods and seem too happy to feel any wish for exit And just
as they fade their humbler sister in white begins to bloom and carries
on through the summer the same intoxicating fragrance
But when June is at its height the sculptured chalices of the Mountain
Laurel begin to unfold and thenceforward for more than a month
extends the reign of this our woodland queen I know not why one should
sigh after the blossoming gorges of the Himalaya when our forests are
all so crowded with this glowing magnificencerounding the tangled
swamps into smoothness lighting up the underwoods overtopping the
pastures lining the rural lanes and rearing its great pinkish masses
till they meet overhead The color ranges from the purest white to a
perfect rosepink and there is an inexhaustible vegetable vigor about
the whole thing which puts to shame those tenderer shrubs that shrink
before the progress of cultivation There is the Rhododendron for
instance a plant of the same natural family with the Laurel and the
Azalea and looking more robust and woody than either it once grew in
many localities in this region and still lingers in a few without
consenting either to die or to blossom and there is only one remote
place from which any one now brings into our streets those large
luxuriant flowers waving white above the dark green leaves and bearing
just a dream of sunset on their edges and just a breath from the green
sea in their hearts But the Laurel on the other hand maintains its
ground imperturbable and almost impassable on every hillside takes
no hints suspects no danger and nothing but the most unmistakable
onset from spade or axe can diminish its profusion Gathering it on the
most lavish scale seems only to serve as wholesome pruning nor can I
conceive that the Indians who once ruled over this whole county from
Wigwam Hill could ever have found it more inconveniently abundant than
now We have perhaps no single spot where it grows in such perfect
picturesqueness as at The Laurels on the Merrimack just above
Newburyporta whole hillside scooped out and the hollow piled
solidly with flowers the pines curving around it above and the river
encircling it below on which your boat glides along and you look up
through glimmering arcades of bloom But for the last half of June it
monopolizes everything in the Worcester woodsno one picks anything
else and it fades so slowly that I have found a perfect blossom on the
last day of July
At the same time with this royalty of the woods the queen of the water
ascends her throne for a reign as undisputed and far more prolonged
The extremes of the WaterLily in this vicinity so far as I have known
are the eighteenth of June and the thirteenth of Octobera longer
range than belongs to any other conspicuous wildflower unless we
except the Dandelion and Houstonia It is not only the most fascinating
of all flowers to gather but more available for decorative purposes
than almost any other if it can only be kept fresh The best method for
this purpose I believe is to cut the stalk very short before placing
in the vase then at night the lily will close and the stalk curl
upwardrefresh them by changing the water and in the morning the
stalk will be straight and the flower open
From this time forth Summer has it all her own way After the first of
July the yellow flowers begin to watch the yellow fireflies Hawkweeds
Loosestrifes Primroses bloom and the bushy Wild Indigo The variety of
hues increases delicate purple Orchises bloom in their chosen
haunts and Wild Roses blush over hill and dale On peat meadows the
AddersTongue Arethusa now called Pogonia flowers profusely with a
faint delicious perfumeand its more elegant cousin the Calopogon
by its side In this vicinity we miss the blue Harebell the identical
harebell of Ellen Douglas which I remember waving its exquisite flowers
along the banks of the Merrimack and again at Brattleboro below the
cascade in the village where it has climbed the precipitous sides
of old buildings and nods inaccessibly from their crevices in that
picturesque spot looking down on the hurrying river But with this
exception there is nothing wanting here of the flowers of early summer
The more closely one studies Nature the finer her adaptations grow For
instance the change of seasons is analogous to a change of zones and
summer assimilates our vegetation to that of the tropics
In those lands Humboldt has remarked one misses the beauty of
wildflowers in the grass because the luxuriance of vegetation develops
everything into shrubs The form and color are beautiful but being
too high above the soil they disturb that harmonious proportion which
characterizes the plants of our European meadows Nature has in every
zone stamped on the landscape the peculiar type of beauty proper to
the locality But every midsummer reveals the same tendency In early
spring when all is bare and small objects are easily made prominent
the wildflowers are generally delicate Later when all verdure is
profusely expanded these miniature strokes would be lost and Nature
then practises landscapegardening in large lights up the copses with
great masses of White Alder makes the roadsides gay with Aster and
GoldenRod and tops the tall coarse MeadowGrass with nodding Lilies
and tufted Spiraea One instinctively follows these plain hints and
gathers bouquets sparingly in spring and exuberantly in summer
The use of wildflowers for decorative purposes merits a word in
passing for it is unquestionably a branch of high art in favored hands
It is true that we are bidden on high authority to love the woodrose
and leave it on its stalk but against this may be set the saying of
Bettine that all flowers which are broken become immortal in the
sacrifice and certainly the secret harmonies of these fair creatures
are so marked and delicate that we do not understand them till we try to
group floral decorations for ourselves The most successful artists
will not for instance consent to put those together which do not grow
together Nature understands her business and distributes her masses
and backgrounds unerringly Yonder soft and feathery MeadowSweet longs
to be combined with Wild Roses it yearns towards them in the field
and after withering in the hand most readily it revives in water as if
to be with them in the vase In the same way the White Spiraea serves as
natural background for the FieldLilies These lilies by the way are
the brightest adornment of our meadows during the short period of their
perfection We have two species one slender erect solitary scarlet
looking up to heaven with all its blushes on the other clustered
drooping paleyellow I never saw the former in such profusion as last
week on the bare summit of Wachusett The granite ribs have there a
thin covering of crispest moss spangled with the white starry blossoms
of the Mountain Cinquefoil and as I lay and watched the red lilies that
waved their innumerable urns around me it needed but little imagination
to see a thousand altars sending visible flames forever upward to the
answering sun
August comes the Thistles are out beloved of butterflies deeper and
deeper tints more passionate intensities of color prepare the way for
the years decline A wealth of gorgeous GoldenRod waves over all the
hills and enriches every bouquet one gathers its bright colors command
the eye and it is graceful as an elm Fitly arranged it gives a bright
relief to the superb beauty of the CardinalFlowers the brilliant
bluepurple of the Vervain the pearlwhite of the LifeEverlasting
the delicate lilac of the MonkeyFlower the soft pink and white of
the Spiraeasfor the white yet lingersall surrounded by trailing
wreaths of blossoming Clematis
But the CardinalFlower is best seen by itself and indeed needs the
surroundings of its native haunts to display its fullest beauty Its
favorite abode is along the dank mossy stones of some black and winding
brook shaded with overarching bushes and running one long stream of
scarlet with these superb occupants It seems amazing how anything so
brilliant can mature in such a darkness When a ray of sunlight strays
in upon it the wondrous creature seems to hover on the stalk ready to
take flight like some lost tropic bird There is a spot whence I have
in ten minutes brought away as many as I could hold in both arms some
bearing fifty blossoms on a single stalk and I could not believe that
there was such another mass of color in the world Nothing cultivated
is comparable to them and with all the talent lately lavished on
wildflower painting I have never seen the peculiar sheen of these
petals in the least degree delineated It seems some new and separate
tint equally distinct from scarlet and from crimson a splendor for
which there is as yet no name but only the reality
It seems the signal of autumn when September exhibits the first
BarrelGentian by the roadside and there is a pretty insect in the
meadowsthe MourningCloak Moth it might be calledwhich gives
coincident warning The innumerable Asters mark this period with their
varied and widespread beauty the meadows are full of rosecolored
Polygala of the white spiral spikes of the LadiesTresses and of
the fringed loveliness of the Gentian This flower always unique and
beautiful opening its delicate eyelashes every morning to the sunlight
closing them again each night has also a thoughtful charm about it
as the last of the years especial darlings It lingers long each
remaining blossom growing larger and more deep in color as with many
other flowers and after it there is nothing for which to look forward
save the fantastic WitchHazel
On the water meanwhile the last White Lilies are sinking beneath the
surface the last gay PickerelWeed is gone though the rootless plants
of the delicate BladderWort spreading over acres of shallows still
impurple the wide smooth surface Harriet Prescott says that some souls
are like the WaterLilies fixed yet floating But others are like this
graceful purple blossom floating unfixed kept in place only by its
fellows around it until perhaps a breeze comes and breaking the
accidental cohesion sweeps them all away
The season reluctantly yields its reign and over the quiet autumnal
landscape everywhere even after the glory of the trees is past there
are tints and fascinations of minor beauty Last October for instance
in walking I found myself on a little knoll looking northward
Overhead was a bower of climbing Waxwork with its yellowish pods scarce
disclosing their scarlet berriesa wild Grapevine with its
fruit withered by the frost into still purple raisinsand yellow
Beechleaves detaching themselves with an effort audible to the ear
In the foreground were blue Raspberrystems yet bearing greenish
leavespaleyellow WitchHazel almost leaflesspurple
Viburnumberriesthe silky cocoons of the Milkweedand amid the
underbrush a few lingering Asters and GoldenRods Ferns still green
and Maidenhair bleached white In the background were hazy hills
white Birches bare and snowlike and a Maple halfway up a sheltered
hillside one mass of canarycolor its fallen leaves making an
apparent reflection on the earth at its footand then a real
reflection fused into a glassy light intenser than itself upon the
smooth dark stream below
The beautiful disrobing suggested the persistent and unconquerable
delicacy of Nature who shrinks from nakedness and is always seeking
to veil her graceful boughsif not with leaves then with feathery
hoarfrost ermined snow or transparent icy armor
But after all the fascination of summer lies not in any details
however perfect but in the sense of total wealth which summer gives
Wholly to enjoy this one must give ones self passively to it and not
expect to reproduce it in words We strive to picture heaven when
we are barely at the threshold of the inconceivable beauty of earth
Perhaps the truant boy who simply bathes himself in the lake and then
basks in the sunshine dimly conscious of the exquisite loveliness
around him is wiser because humbler than is he who with presumptuous
phrases tries to utter it There are multitudes of moments when the
atmosphere is so surcharged with luxury that every pore of the body
becomes an ample gate for sensation to flow in and one has simply to
sit still and be filled In afteryears the memory of books seems barren
or vanishing compared with the immortal bequest of hours like these
Other sources of illumination seem cisterns only these are fountains
They may not increase the mere quantity of available thought but they
impart to it a quality which is priceless No man can measure what a
single hour with Nature may have contributed to the moulding of his
mind The influence is selfrenewing and if for a long time it baffles
expression by reason of its fineness so much the better in the end
The soul is like a musical instrument it is not enough that it be
framed for the very most delicate vibration but it must vibrate long
and often before the fibres grow mellow to the finest waves of sympathy
I perceive that in the veerys carolling the clovers scent the
glistening of the water the waving wings of butterflies the sunset
tints the floating clouds there are attainable infinitely more
subtile modulations of delight than I can yet reach the sensibility to
discriminate much less describe If in the simple process of writing
one could physically impart to this page the fragrance of this spray of
azalea beside me what a wonder would it seemand yet one ought to be
able by the mere use of language to supply to every reader the total
of that white honeyed trailing sweetness which summer insects haunt
and the Spirit of the Universe loves The defect is not in language
but in men There is no conceivable beauty of blossom so beautiful as
wordsnone so graceful none so perfumed It is possible to dream of
combinations of syllables so delicious that all the dawning and decay of
summer cannot rival their perfections nor winters stainless white
and azure match their purity and their charm To write them were it
possible would be to take rank with Nature nor is there any other
method even by music for human art to reach so high
ONE OF MY CLIENTS
After a practice in the legal profession of more than twenty years I am
persuaded that a more interesting volume could not be written than the
revelations of a lawyers office The plots there discovered before they
were maturedthe conspiracies there detected
Ere they hail reached their last fatal periods
the various devices of the Prince of Darknessthe weapons with which
he fought and those by which he was overcomethe curious phenomena of
intense activity and love of gainthe arts of the detective and those
by which he was eludedand the neverending and evervarying surprises
and startling incidentswould present such a panorama of human affairs
as would outfly our fancy and modify our unbelief in that muchabused
doctrine of the depravity of our nature
To illustrate let me introduce to you one of my clients whom I will
call Mr Sidney and with whom perhaps you may hereafter become better
acquainted His counterpart in personal appearance you may find in the
thoroughfare at any hour of the day There is nothing about him to
attract attention He is nearly fortyfive years of age and weighs
perhaps two hundred pounds His face is florid and his hair sandy His
eyes are small piercing and gray His motions are slow and none are
made without a purpose Intellectually he is above the average and his
perceptive faculties are well developed The wrinkles in his lips are at
right angles with his mouth and a close observer might detect in his
countenance selfreliance and tenacity of will and purpose But with
ordinary faculties much may be accomplished in this sketch let us see
how much in two particulars
His first entrance into my office was in the spring of 1853 He
handed me a package of papers saying if I would name an hour for a
professional consultation he would be punctual The time was agreed
upon and he withdrew On examination of his papers I found that his
letters of introduction were from several United States Senators Judges
of Supreme Courts Cabinet Officers and Governors and one was from a
Presidential candidate in the last election Those directed specially
to me were from a Senator and a Member of Congress both of whom were
lawyers and my personal friends men in whose judgment I placed great
confidence They all spoke in the highest terms of Mr Sidneys
integrity ability and energy and concluded by saying I might
implicitly rely upon his judgment and be governed by his counsels
What man of the masses can this one be thus heralded by the authorities
of the nation and what his labor so commended by the rulers I glanced
at him mentally again Perhaps he is laboring for the endowment of some
great literary or benevolent institution for the building of a national
monument No Perhaps he has some theory that thousands of facts must
prove and illustrate or it may be he is a voracious gatherer of
statistics The last is the most probable but the more I mused the
more the fire burned within me to know more of his mission
I awaited impatiently his coming It was on the stroke of the hour
appointed The object of that interview may not with propriety be
stated nor the results described but it may be said that that hour was
the most intensely exciting of any of my professional life causing the
blood to chill and boil alternately The business was so peculiar and
connected with men so exalted in position and conducted with such
wonderful ability and tact that now years after scarcely a day passes
that my mind does not revert to those hours and do homage to those
transcendent abilities by which it was conducted till I sometimes think
the possessor of them was an overmatch for Lucifer himself My eyes
were for the first time opened to the marvellous in his department
of knowledge and art and the region of impossibility was materially
circumscribed and the domain of the prince of the powers of the air
extended ad infinitum Into those regions it is not my present purpose
to delve
After a business acquaintance of several years with Mr Sidney I have
learned that he was formerly a rich manufacturer and that he was nearly
ruined in fortune by the burning of several warehouses in which he had
stored a large amount of merchandise that was uninsured The owners of
these storehouses were men of wealth influence and respectability
Alone of all the citizens Mr Sidney suspected that the block was
intentionally set on fire to defraud the insuranceoffices Without
any aid or knowledge of other parties he began an investigation and
ascertained that the buildings were insured far beyond their value
He also ascertained that insurance had been obtained on a far greater
amount of merchandise than the stores could contain and still further
that the goods insured as being deposited there were not so deposited
