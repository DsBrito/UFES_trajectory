hundred people could have found sittings in it and doubtless they
had done so when Busscombe was a large manufacturing town before the
failure of the coal supply and other causes drove away its trade Now
it was much what it had been in the time of the Normans a little
agricultural village with a population of 300 souls Out of this
population including the choir boys exactly thirtynine had elected to
attend church on this particular Sunday and of these three were fast
asleep and four were dozing
The Rev Thomas Owen counted them from his seat in the chancel for
another clergyman was preaching and as he counted bitterness and
disappointment took hold of him The preacher was a Deputation sent
by one of the large missionary societies to arouse the indifferent to
a sense of duty towards their unconverted black brethren in Africa and
incidentally to collect cash to be spent in the conversion of the
said brethren The Rev Thomas Owen himself suggested the visit of the
Deputation and had laboured hard to secure him a good audience But
the beauty of the weather or terror of the inevitable subscription
prevailed against him Hence his disappointment
Well he thought with a sigh I have done my best and I must make
it up out of my own pocket
Then he settled himself to listen to the sermon
The preacher a batteredlooking individual of between fifty and sixty
years of age was gaunt with recent sickness patient and unimaginative
in aspect He preached extemporarily with the aid of notes and it
cannot be said that his discourse was remarkable for interest at any
rate in its beginning Doubtless the sparse congregation so prone to
slumber discouraged him for offering exhortations to empty benches is
but weary work Indeed he was meditating the advisability of bringing
his argument to an abrupt conclusion when chancing to glance round he
became aware that he had at least one sympathetic listener his host
the Rev Thomas Owen
From that moment the sermon improved by degrees till at length it
reached a really high level of excellence Ceasing from rhetoric the
speaker began to tell of his own experience and sufferings in the Cause
amongst savage tribes for he himself was a missionary of many years
standing He told how once he and a companion had been sent to a
nation who named themselves the Sons of Fire because their god was the
lightning if indeed they could be said to boast any gods other than
the Spear and the King In simple language he narrated his terrible
adventures among these savages the murder of his companion by command
of the Council of Wizards and his own flight for his life a tale
so interesting and vivid that even the bucolic sleepers awakened and
listened openmouthed
But this is by the way he went on for my Society does not ask you
to subscribe towards the conversion of the Children of Fire Until that
people is conqueredwhich very likely will not be for generations
seeing that they live in Central Africa occupying a territory that
white men do not desireno missionary will dare again to visit them
At this moment something caused him to look a second time at Thomas
Owen He was leaning forward in his place listening eagerly and a
strange light filled the large dark eyes that shone in the pallor of
his delicate nervous face
There is a man who would dare if he were put to it thought the
Deputation to himself Then he ended his sermon
That evening the two men sat at dinner in the rectory It was a very
fine rectory beautifully furnished for Owen was a man of taste which
he had the means to gratify Also although they were alone the dinner
was goodso good that the poor brokendown missionary sipping his
unaccustomed port a vintage wine sighed aloud in admiration and
involuntary envy
What is the matter asked Owen
Nothing Mr Owen then of a sudden thawing into candour he
added that is everything Heaven forgive me but I who enjoy your
hospitality am envious of you Dont think too hardly of me I have a
large family to support and if only you knew what a struggle my life
is and has been for the last twenty years you would not I am sure
But you have never experienced it and could not understand The
labourer is worthy of his hire Well my hire is under two hundred a
year and eight of us must liveor starveon it And I have worked
ay until my health is broken A labourer indeed I am a very hodman a
spiritual Sisyphus And now I must go back to carry my load and roll
my stone again and again among those hopeless savages till I die of
ittill I die of it
At least it is a noble life and death exclaimed Owen a sudden fire
of enthusiasm burning in his dark eyes
Yes viewed from a distance Were you asked to leave this living of two
thousand a yearI see that is what they put it at in Crockfordwith
its English comforts and easy work that you might lead that life and
attain that death then you would think differently But why should
I bore you with such talk Thank Heaven that your lines are cast in
pleasant places Yes please I will take one more glass it does me
good
Tell me some more about that tribe you were speaking of in your sermon
the Sons of Fire I think you called them said Owen as he passed him
the decanter
So with an eloquence induced by the generous wine and a quickened
imagination the Deputation told himtold him many strange things and
terrible For this people was an awful people vigorous in mind
and body and warriors from generation to generation but
superstitionridden and cruel They lived in the far interior some
months journey by boat and oxwaggon from the coast and of white men
and their ways they knew but little
How many of them are there asked Owen
Who can say he answered Nearly halfamillion perhaps at least
they pretend that they can put sixty thousand men under arms
And did they treat you badly when you first visited them
Not at first They received us civilly enough and on a given day we
were requested to explain to the king and the Council of Wizards the
religion which we came to teach All that day we explained and all
the nextor rather my friend did for I knew very little of the
languageand they listened with great interest At last the chief of
the wizards and the first prophet to the king rose to question us He
was named Hokosa a tall thin man with a spiritual face and terrible
calm eyes
You speak well son of a White Man he said but let us pass from
words to deeds You tell us that this God of yours whom you desire that
we should take as our God so that you may become His chief prophets in
the land was a wizard such as we are though grater than we are for
not only did He know the past and the future as we do but also He could
cure those who were smitten with hopeless sickness and raise those
who were dead which we cannot do You tell us moreover that by faith
those who believe on Him can do works as great as He did and that you
do believe on Him Therefore we will put you to the proof Ho there
lead forth that evil one
As he spoke a man was placed before us one who had been convicted of
witchcraft or some other crime
Kill him said Hokosa
There was a faint cry a scuffle a flashing of spears and the man lay
still before us
Now followers of the new God said Hokosa raise him from the dead
as your Master did
In vain did we offer explanations
Peace said Hokosa at length your words weary us Look now either
you have preached to us a false god and are liars or you are traitors
to the King you preach since lacking faith in Him you cannot do such
works as He gives power to do to those who have faith in Him Out of
your own mouths are you judged White Men Choose which horn of the bull
you will you hang to one of them and it shall pierce you This is
the sentence of the king I speak it who am the kings mouth That you
White Man who have spoken to us and cheated us these two weary days
be put to death and that you his companion who have been silent be
driven from the land
I can hardly bear to tell the rest of it Mr Owen They gave my poor
friend ten minutes to talk to his Spirit then they speared him before
my face After it was over Hokosa spoke to me saying
Go back White Man to those who sent you and tell them the words of
the Sons of Fire That they have listened to the message of peace
and though they are a people of warriors yet they thank them for that
message for in itself it sounds good and beautiful in their ears if it
be true Tell them that having proved you liars they dealt with you as
all honest men seek that liars should be dealt with Tell them that they
desire to hear more of this matter and if one can be sent to them who
has no false tongue who in all things fulfills the promises of his
lips that they will hearken to him and treat him well but that for
such as you they keep a spear
And who went after you got back asked Owen who was listening with
the deepest interest
Who went Do you suppose that there are many mad clergymen in Africa
Mr Owen Nobody went
And yet said Owen speaking more to himself than to his guest the
man Hokosa was right and the Christian who of a truth believes the
promises of our religion should trust to them and go
Then perhaps you would like to undertake the mission Mr Owen said
the Deputation briskly for the reflection stung him unintentional as
it was
Owen started
That is a new idea he said And now perhaps you wish to go to bed
it is past eleven oclock
CHAPTER II
THOMAS OWEN
Thomas Owen went to his room but not to bed Taking a Bible from the
table he consulted reference after reference
The promise is clear he said aloud presently as he shut the
book clear and often repeated There is no escape from it and no
possibility of a double meaning If it is not true then it would seem
that nothing is true and that every Christian in the world is tricked
and deluded But if it is true why do we never hear of miracles
The answer is easy Because we have not faith enough to work them The
Apostles worked miracles for they had seen therefore their faith was
perfect Since their day nobodys faith has been quite perfect at least
I think not The physical part of our nature prevents it Or perhaps the
miracles still happen but they are spiritual miracles
Then he sat down by the open window and gazing at the dreamy beauty of
the summer night he thought for his soul was troubled Once before
it had been troubled thus that was nine years ago for now he was but
little over thirty Then a call had come to him a voice had seemed to
speak to his ears bidding him to lay down great possessions to follow
whither Heaven should lead him Thomas Owen had obeyed the voice
though owing to circumstances which need not be detailed to do so he
was obliged to renounce his succession to a very large estate and to
content himself with a younger sons portion of thirty thousand pounds
and the reversion to the living which he had now held for some five
years
Then and there with singular unanimity and despatch his relations came
to the conclusion that he was mad To this hour indeed those who stand
in his place and enjoy the wealth and position that were his by right
speak of him as poor Thomas and mark their disapprobation of his
peculiar conduct by refusing with an unvarying steadiness to subscribe
even a single shilling to a missionary society How poor Thomas speaks
of them in the place where he is we may wonder but as yet we cannot
knowprobably with the gentle love and charity that marked his every
action upon earth But this is by the way
He had entered the Church but what had he done in its shadow This was
the question which Owen asked himself as he sat that night by the open
window arraigning his past before the judgmentseat of conscience For
three years he had worked hard somewhere in the slums then this living
had fallen to him He had taken it and from that day forward his record
was very much of a blank The parish was small and well ordered there
was little to do in it and the Salvation Army had seized upon and
reclaimed two of the three confirmed drunkards it could boast
His guests saying echoed in his brain like the catch of a tunethat
you might lead that life and attain that death Supposing that
he were bidden so to do now this very night would he indeed think
differently He had become a priest to serve his Maker How would it be
were that Maker to command that he should serve Him in this extreme and
heroic fashion Would he flinch from the steel or would he meet it as
the martyrs met it of old
Physically he was little suited to such an enterprise for in appearance
he was slight and pale and in constitution delicate Also there was
another reason against the thing High Church and somewhat ascetic in
his principles in the beginning he had admired celibacy and in secret
dedicated himself to that state But at heart Thomas was very much a
man and of late he had come to see that which is against nature is
presumably not right though fanatics may not hesitate to pronounce
it wrong Possibly this conversion to more genial views of life was
quickened by the presence in the neighbourhood of a young lady whom
he chanced to admire at least it is certain that the mere thought of
seeing her no more for ever smote him like a sword of sudden pain
That very nightor so it seemed to him and so he believedthe Angel
of the Lord stood before him as he was wont to stand before the men of
old and spoke a summons in his ear How or in what seeming that summons
came Thomas Owen never told and we need not inquire At the least he
heard it and like the Apostles he arose and girded his loins to obey
For now in the hour of trial it proved that this mans faith partook
of the nature of their faith It was utter and virgin it was not
clogged with nineteenthcentury qualifications it had never dallied
with strange doctrines or kissed the feet of pinchbeck substitutes for
God In his heart he believed that the Almighty without intermediary
but face to face had bidden him to go forth into the wilderness there
to perish So he bowed his head and went
On the following morning at breakfast Owen had some talk with his friend
the Deputation
You asked me last night he said quietly whether I would undertake
a mission to that people of whom you were telling methe Sons of Fire
Well I have been thinking it over and come to the conclusion that I
will do so
At this point the Deputation concluding that his host must be mad
moved quietly but decidedly towards the door
Wait a moment went on Owen in a matteroffact voice the dogcart
will not be round for another threequarters of an hour Tell me if it
were offered to you and on investigation you proved suitable would you
care to take over this living
Would I care to take over this living gasped the astonished
Deputation Would I care to walk down that garden and find myself in
Heaven But why are you making fun of me
I am not making fun of you If I go to Africa I must give up the
living of which I own the advowson and it occurred to me that it might
suit youthat is all You have done your share your health is broken
and you have many dependent upon you It seems right therefore that
you should rest and that I should work If I do no good yonder at the
least you and yours will be a little benefited
That same day Owen chanced to meet the lady who has been spoken of as
having caught his heart He had meant to go away without seeing her but
fortune brought them together Hitherto whilst in reality leading him
on she had seemed to keep him at a distance with the result that he
did not know that it was her fixed intention to marry him To her
with some hesitation he told his plans Surprised and frightened into
candour the lady reasoned with him warmly and when reason failed to
move him she did more By some subtle movement with some sudden word
she lifted the veil of her reserve and suffered him to see her heart
If you will not stay for aught else said her troubled eyes then
love stay for me
For a moment he was shaken Then he answered the look straight out as
was his nature
I never guessed he said I did not presume to hopenow it is too
late Listen I will tell you what I have told no living soul though
thereafter you may think me mad Weak and humble as I am I believe
myself to have received a Divine mission I believe that I shall execute
it or bring about its execution but at the ultimate cost of my own
life Still in such a service two are better than one If youcan care
enoughif you
But the lady had already turned away and was murmuring her farewell in
accents that sounded like a sob Love and faith after this sort were not
given to her
Of all Owens trials this was the sharpest Of all his sacrifices this
was the most complete
CHAPTER III
THE TEMPTATION
Two years have gone by all but a few months and from the rectory in a
quiet English village we pass to a scene in Central or South Central
Africa
On the brow of a grassy slope dotted over with mimosa thorns and close
to a gushing stream of water stands a house or rather a hut built
of green brick and thatched with grass Behind this hut is a fence of
thorns rough but strong designed to protect all within it from the
attacks of lions and other beasts of prey At present save for a
solitary mule eating its provender by the wheel of a tented oxwaggon
it is untenanted for the cattle have not yet been kraaled for the
night Presently Thomas Owen enters this enclosure by the back door of
the hut and having attended to the mule which whinnies at the sight
of him goes to the gate and watches there till he sees his native boys
driving the cattle up the slope of the hill At length they arrive and
when he has counted them to make sure that none are missing and in a
few kind words commended the herds for their watchfulness he walks
to the front of the house and seating himself upon a wooden stool set
under a mimosa tree that grows near the door he looks earnestly towards
the west
The man has changed somewhat since last we saw him To begin with he
has grown a beard and although the hot African sun has bronzed it
into an appearance of health his face is even thinner than it was and
therein the great spiritual eyes shine still more strangely
At the foot of the slope runs a wide river just here broken into rapids
where the waters make an angry music Beyond this river stretches a
vast plain bounded on the horizon by mountain ranges each line of them
rising higher than the other till their topmost and more distant peaks
melt imperceptibly into the tender blue of the heavens This is the land
of the Sons of Fire and yonder amid the slopes of the nearest hills is
the great kraal of their king Umsuka whose name being interpreted
means The Thunderbolt
In the very midst of the foaming rapids and about a thousand yards
from the house lies a space of rippling shallow water where unless it
chances to be in flood the river can be forded It is this ford that
Owen watches so intently
John should have been back twelve hours ago he mutters to himself I
pray that no harm has befallen him at the Great Place yonder
Just then a tiny speck appears far away on the plain It is a man
travelling towards the water at a swinging trot Going into the hut
Owen returns with a pair of fieldglasses and through them scrutinises
the figure of the man
Heaven be praised It is John he mutters with a sigh of relief
Now I wonder what answer he brings
Half an hour later John stands before him a stalwart native of the
tribe of the Amasuka the People of Fire and with uplifted hand salutes
him giving him titles of honour
Praise me not John said Owen praise God only as I have taught you
to do Tell me have you seen the king and what is his word
Father he answered I journeyed to the great town as you bade me
and I was admitted before the majesty of the king yes he received me
in the courtyard of the House of Women With his guards who stood at
a distance out of hearing there were present three only but oh those
three were great the greatest in all the land after the king They were
Hafela the king that is to come the prince Nodwengo his brother and
Hokosa the terrible the chief of the wizards and I tell you father
that my blood dried up and my heart shrivelled when they turned their
eyes upon me reading the thoughts of my heart
Have I not told you John to trust in God and fear nothing at the
hands of man
You told me father but still I feared answered the messenger
humbly Yet being bidden to it I lifted my forehead from the dust
and stood upon my feet before the king and delivered to him the message
which you set between my lips
Repeat the message John
O King I said beneath those footfall the whole earth shakes whose
arms stretch round the world and whose breath is the storm I whose
name is John am sent by the white man whose name is Messengerfor by
that title you bade me make you knownwho for a year has dwelt in the
land that your spears have wasted beyond the banks of the river These
are the words which he spoke to me O King that I pass on to you with
my tongue To the King Umsuka lord of the Amasuka the Sons of Fire
I Messenger who am the servant and the ambassador of the King of
Heaven give greeting A year ago King I sent to you saying that the
message which was brought by that white man whom you drove from your
land had reached the ears of Him whom I serve the High and Holy One
and that speaking in my heart He had commanded me to take up the
challenge of your message Here am I therefore ready to abide by the
law which you have laid down for if guile or lies be found in me then
let me travel from your land across the bridge of spears Still I would
dwell a little while here where I am before I pass into the shadow of
your rule and speak in the ears of your people as I have been bidden
Know King that first I would learn your tongue and therefore I demand
that one of your people may be sent to dwell with me and to teach me
that tongue King you heard my words and you sent me a man to dwell
with me and that man has taught me your tongue and I also have taught
him converting him to my faith and giving him a new name the name of
John King now I seek your leave to visit you and to deliver into your
ears the words with which I Messenger am charged I have spoken
Thus I John addressed the great ones my father and they listened
in silence When I had done they spoke together a word here and a word
there Then Hokosa the kings mouth answered me telling the thought
of the king You are a bold man you whose name is John but who once
had another nameyou my servant who dare to appear before me and to
make it known to me that you have been turned to a new faith and serve
another king than I Yet because you are bold I forgive you Go back
now to that white man who is named Messenger and who comes upon an
embassy to me from the Lord of Heaven and bid him come in peace Yet
warn him once again that here also we know something of the Powers that
are not seen here also we have our wizards who draw wisdom from the
air who tame the thunderbolt and compel the rain and that he must
show himself greater than all of these if he would not pass hence by the
bridge of spears Let him therefore take counsel with his heart and
with Him he serves if such a One there is and let him come or let him
stay away as it shall please him
So be it said Owen the words of the king are good and tomorrow we
will start for the Great Place
John heard and assented but without eagerness
My father he said in a doubtful and tentative voice would it not
perhaps be better to bide here awhile first
Why asked Owen We have sown and now is the hour to reap
It is so my father but as I ran hither full of the kings words it
came into my mind that now is not the time to convert the Sons of Fire
There is trouble brewing at the Great Palace father Listen and I will
tell you as I have heard so I will tell you You know well that our
King Umsuka has two sons Hafela and Nodwengo and of these Hafela is
the heirapparent the fruit of the chief wife of the king and Nodwengo
is sprung from another wife Now Hafela is proud and cruel a warrior of
warriors a terrible man and Nodwengo is gentle and mild like to his
mother whom the king loves Of late it has been discovered that Hafela
weary of waiting for power has made a plot to depose his father and to
kill Nodwengo his brother so that the land and those who dwell in it
may become his without question This plot the king knowsI had it from
one of his women who is my sisterand he is very wroth yet he dare do
little for he grows old and timid and seeks rest not war Yet he is
minded if he can find the heart to go back upon the law and to
name Nodwengo as his heir before all the army at the feast of the
firstfruits which shall be held on the third day from tonight This
Hafela knows and Nodwengo knows it also and each of them has summoned
his following numbering thousands and tens of thousands of spears to
attend this feast of the firstfruits That feast may well be a feast
of vultures my father and when the brothers and their regiments rush
together fighting for the throne what will chance to the white man who
comes at such a moment to preach a faith of peace and to his servant
one John who led him there
I do not know answered Owen and it troubles me not at all I go to
carry out my mission and in this way or in that it will be carried out
John if you are fearful or unbelieving leave me to go alone
Nay father I am not fearful yet father I would have you
understand Yonder there are men who can work wizardry Wow I know
for I have seen it and they will demand from you magic greater than
their magic
What of it John
Only this my father that if they ask and you fail to give they will
kill you You teach beautiful things but say are you a wizard When
the child of a woman yonder lay dead you could not raise it as did the
Christ when the oxen were sick with the pest you could not cure them
or at least my father you did not although you wept for the child and
were sorry at the loss of the oxen Now my father if perchance
they ask you to do such things as these yonder or die say what will
happen
One of two things John either I shall die or I shall do the things
Buthesitated Johnsurely you do not believe that and he broke
off
Owen turned round and looked at his disciple with kindling eyes I do
believe O you of little faith he said I do believe that yonder I
have a mission and that He Whom I serve will give me power to carry
out that mission You are right I can work no miracles but He can work
miracles Whom everything in heaven and earth obeys and if there is need
He will work them through me His instrument Or perhaps He will
not work them and I shall die because thus His ends will best be
forwarded At the least I go in faith fearing nothing for what has he
to fear who knows the will of God and does it But to you who doubt I
sayleave me
The man spread out his hands in deprecation his thick lips trembled a
little and something like a tear appeared at the corners of his eyes
Father he said am I a coward that you should talk to me thus
I who for twenty years have been a soldier of my king and for ten a
captain in my regiment These scars show whether or no I am a coward
and he pointed to his breast but of them I will not speak I am no
coward else I had not gone upon that errand of yours Why then should
you reproach me because my ears are not so open as yours as my heart
has not understanding I worship that God of Whom you have taught me
but He never speaks to me as He does to you I never meet Him as I walk
at night He leaves me quite alone Therefore it is that I fear that
when the hour of trial comes He may desert you and unless He covers you
with His shield of this I am sure that the spear is forged which shall
blush red in your heart my father It is for you that I fear who are
so gentle and tender not for myself who am well accustomed to look in
the eyes of Death and who expect no more than death
Forgive me said Owen hastily for he was moved and be sure that
the shield will be over us till the time comes for us to pass whither we
shall need none
That night Owen rose from the task at which he was labouring slowly and
painfullya translation of passages from the Gospel of St John into
the language of the Amasukaand going to the open windowplace of the
hut he rested his elbows upon it and thought staring with empty eyes
into the blackness of the night Now it was as he sat thus that a great
agony of doubt took possession of his soul The strength which hitherto
had supported him seemed to be withdrawn and he was left as John
had said quite alone Strange voices seemed to whisper in his ears
reproaching and reviling him temptations long ago trampled under foot
rose again in might alluring him
Fool said the voices get you hence before it is too late You have
been mad you who dreamed that for your sake to satisfy your pride the
Almighty will break His silence and strain His law Are you then better
or greater or purer than millions who have gone before you that for
you and you alone this thing should be done Why were it not that you
are mad you would be among the chief of sinners you who dare to ask
that the Powers of Heaven should be set within your feeble hand that
the Angels of Heaven should wait upon your mortal breath Worm that you
are has God need of such as you If it is His will to turn the heart
of yonder people He will do it but not by means of you You and the
servant whom you are deluding to his death will perish miserably and
this alone shall be the fruit of your presumptuous sin Get you back out
of this wilderness before the madness takes you afresh You are still
young you have wealth look where She stands yonder whom you desire
Get you back and forget your folly in her arms
These thoughts and many others of like nature tore Owens soul in
that hour of strange and terrible temptation He seemed to see himself
standing before the thousands of the savage nation he went to save and
to hear the mocking voices of their witchfinders commanding him if he
were a true man and the servant of that God of Whom he prated to
give them a sign only a little sign perhaps to move a stone without
touching it with his hand or to cause a dead bough to blossom
Then he would beseech Heaven with frantic prayers and in vain till at
length amidst a roar of laughter he the false prophet and the liar
was led out to his doom He saw the piteous wondering look of the
believer whom he had betrayed to death he saw the fierce faces and
the spears on high Seeing all this his spirit broke and just as the
little clock in the room behind him struck the first stroke of midnight
with a great and bitter cry to God to give him back the faith and
strength that he had lost Owens head fell forward and he sank into a
