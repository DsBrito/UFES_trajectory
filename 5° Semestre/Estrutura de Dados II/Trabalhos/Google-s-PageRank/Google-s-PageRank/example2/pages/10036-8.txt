THE MYSTERY OF MR E DROOD
AN ADAPTATION
BY ORPHEUS C KERR
CHAPTER XXI
BENTHAM TO THE RESCUE
European travellers in this countryespecially if one economical
condition of their coming hither has not been the composition of works
of imagination on America sufficiently contemptuous to pay all the
expenses of the triphave occasionallyand particularly if they have
been invited to write for New York magazines take professorships in
native colleges or lecture on the encouraging Continental progress of
scientific atheism before Boston audiencessuch travellers we say
convinced that they shall lose no money by it but on the contrary
rather sanguine of making a little thereby in the long run have
occasionally remarked that in the United States women journeying
alone are treated with a chivalric courtesy and deference not so
habitually practiced in any other secondclass new nation on the face of
the earth1
What oh what can be more true than this A lady well stricken in
years and of adequate protraction of nose and rectilinear undeviation
of figure can travel alone from Maine to Florida with as perfect
immunity from offensive masculine intrusion as though she were guarded
by a regiment while a somewhat younger girl with curls and an innocent
look can not appear unaccompanied by an escort in an American omnibus
car ferryboat or hotel without appealing at once to the finest
fatherly feelings of every manly middleaged observer whose wife is not
watching him and exciting as general a desire to make her trip socially
delightful as though each gentlemanly eye seeking hers were indeed that
of a tender sire
Thus although Miss POTTSS lonely stay in her hotel had been so brief
the mysterious American instinct of chivalry had discovered it very
early on the first morning after her arrival and she arose from her
delicious sleep to find at least half a dozen written offers of
hospitality from generous strangers sticking under her door
Understanding that she was sojourning without natural protectors in a
strange city the thoughtful writers who appeared to be chiefly Western
men of implied immense fortunes begged her by the delicate name of
Fair Unknown to take comfort in the thought that they were stopping
at the same hotel and would protect her from all harm with their lives
In proof of this unselfish disposition on their parts several of them
were respectively ready to take her to a circusmatinee or to drive in
Central Park on that very day and her prompt acceptance of these
signal evidences of a disinterested friendship for womanhood without a
natural protector could not be more simply indicated to those who now
freely offered such friendship than by her dropping her fork twice at
the public breakfast table or sending the waiter back three times
with the boiled eggs to have them cooked rightly
FLORA had completed her chemical toilet put all the bottles jars and
small round boxes back into her satchel again and sat down to a second
reading of these gratifying intimations that a prepossessing female
orphan is not necessarily without assiduous paternal guardianship at her
command wherever there are Western fathers when Mr DIBBLE appeared as
he had promised accompanied by Gospeler SIMPSON
Miss CAROWTHERS was so excited by your sudden flight Miss POTTS said
the latter that she came at once to me and OLDY with your farewell
note and would not stop saying Did you ever until to restrain my
aggravated mother from fits I promised to follow you to your guardians
and ascertain what your goodbye note would have meant if it had
actually been punctuated
Our reverend friend reached me about an hour ago added Mr DIBBLE
saying that a farewell note without a comma colon semicolon or
period in it and with every other word beginning with a capital and
underscored was calculated to drive friends to distraction I took the
liberty of reminding him my dear that young girls from boardingschool
should hardly be expected to have advanced as far as English composition
in their French and musical studies and I also related to him what you
had told me of Mr BUMSTEAD
And I dont know that under the circumstances you could do a better
thing than you have done continued the Gospeler Mr BUMSTEAD
himself explains your flight upon the supposition that you were
possibly engaged with myself my mother Mr DIBBLE and the PENDRAGONS
in killing poor Mr DROOD
Oh oughtnt he to be ashamed of himself when he knows that I never
did kill any absurd creature cried the Flowerpot in earnest
deprecation And just think of darling MAGNOLIA too with her poor
ridiculous brother Youre a lawyer Mr DIBBLE and I should think you
could get them a habeas corpus or a divorce or some other perfectly
absurd thing about courts that would make the judges tell the juries to
bring them in Not Guilty
Fixing upon the lovely young reasoner a look expressive of his
affectionate wonder at her inspired perception of legal possibilities
the old lawyer said that the first thing in order was a meeting between
herself and Miss PENDRAGON which as it could scarcely take place all
things considered with propriety in the private room of that ladys
brother nor without publicity in his own office or in a hotel he
hardly knew how to bring about
And here we have an example of that difference between novels and real
life which has been illustrated more than once before in this
conscientious American Adaptation of what all our profoundly critical
native journals pronounce the most elaborately artistic work of the
grandest of English novelists In an equivalent situation of real life
Mr DIBBLES quandary would not have been easily relieved but by the
magic of artistic fiction the particular kind of extemporized character
absolutely necessary to help him and the novel continuously along was at
that moment coming up the stairs of the hotel2
At the critical instant a servant knocked to say that there was a
gentleman below with a face as long me arrum sir who axed me was
there a man here av the name av SIMPSON Miss
It is JOHNit is Mr BUMSTEAD shrieked FLORA hastening
involuntarily towards a mirrorand just see how my dress is
wrinkled
My name is BENTHAMJEREMY BENTHAM said a deep voice in the doorway
and there entered a gloomy figure with smoky light hair a curiously
long countenance and black worsted gloves SIMPSONold
OCTAVIUSdid you never never see me before
If I am not greatly mistaken returned the Gospeler sternly I saw
you standing in the barroom of the hotel just now as we came up
Yes sighed the stranger I was therewaiting for a Western
friendwhen you passed in And has sorrow then so changed me that
you do not know me Alas alack woes me
BENTHAM you say cried the Ritualistic clergyman with a start and
sudden change of countenance Surely youre not the rollicking
fellowstudent who saved my life at Yale
I am I am sobbed the other smiting his bosom While studying
theology youd gone to sleep in bed reading the Decameron I in the
next room suddenly smelt a smell of wood burning Breaking into your
apartment I saw your candle fallen upon your pillow and your head on
fire Believing that if neglected the flames would spread to some
vital part I seized a waterpitcher and dashed the contents upon you
Up you instantly sprang with a theological expression on your lips and
engaged me in violent single combat Madman roared I is it thus you
treat one who has saved your life Falling upon the floor with a black
eye you at once consented to be reconciled and from that hour forth
we were both members of the same secret society
Leaping forward the Reverend OCTAVIUS wrung both the black worsted
gloves of Mr BENTHAM and introduced the latter to the old lawyer and
his ward
He did indeed save all but my head from the conflagration and
extinguished that even before it was much charred cried the grateful
Ritualist with marked emotionBut JEREMY why this aspect of
depression
OCTAVIUS old friend said BENTHAM his hollow voice quivering let
no man boast himself upon the gaiety of his youth and fondly
dreampoor selfdeceiverthat his maturity may be one of revelry You
know what I once was Now I am conducting a firstclass American Comic
Paper
Commiseration earnest and unaffected appeared upon every countenance
and Mr DIBBLE was the first to break the ensuing deep silence
If I am not mistaken then observed the good lawyer quietly the
scene of your daily loss of spirits is in the same building with our
young friend Mr PENDRAGON whom you may know
I do know him sir and that his sister has lately come unto him His
room by means of outside shutters was once a refuge to me from the
ManHere Mr BENTHAMS face flamed with inconceivable hatredwho
came to tell me just how an American firstclass Comic Paper should be
conducted
At what time does your rush of subscribers cease
As soon as I begin to charge anything for my paper
And the newsmen who take it by the weekwhat is their usual time for
swarming in your office
On the day appointed for the return of unsold copies
Then I have an idea said Mr DIBBLE It appears to me Mr
BENTHAM that your office besides being so near Mr PENDRAGONS
quarters furnishes all the conditions for a perfectly private
confidential interview between this young lady here and her friend
Miss PENDRAGON Mr SIMPSON if you approve be kind enough to acquaint
Mr BENTHAM with Miss POTTSS history without mentioning names and
explain to him also why the ladies interview should take place in a
spot whither that singular young man Mr BUMSTEAD would not be likely
to prowl if in town in his inspection of umbrellas
The Gospeler hurriedly related the material points of FLORAS history to
his recovered friend who moaned with all the more cheerful parts and
seemed to think that the serious ones might be workedup in comic
missspelling for his paperFor there is nothing more humorous in
human life said he gloomily than the defective orthography of a
fashionable young girls education for the solemnity of matrimony
Finally they all set off for the appointed place of retirement upon
nearing which Mr DIBBLE volunteered to remain outside as a guard
against any possible interruption The Gospeler led the way up the dark
stairs of the building when they had gained it and the Flowerpot
following on JEREMY BENTHAMS arm could not help glancing shyly up
into the melancholy face of her escort occasionally Do you never
smile she could not help asking
Yes he said mournfully sometimes when I clean my teeth
No more was said for they were entering the room of which the tone and
atmosphere were those of a receivingvault
Footnote 1 Shades of QUINTILIAN and Dr JOHNSON what a

independently of any specific design to that end by the Adapter this
Adaptation carefully following the original English narrative as it
does can not avoid acting as a kind of practicaland of course
somewhat exaggerativecommentary upon what is strained forced or out
of the line of average probabilities in the work Adapted
CHAPTER XXII
A CONFUSED STATE OF THINGS
The principal office of the Comic Paper was one of those amazingly
unsympathetic rooms in which the walls windows and doors all have a
stiff unsalient aspect of the most hardfinished indifference to every
emotion of humanity and a perfectly rigid insensibility to the
pleasures or pains of the tenants within their impassive shelter In the
whole configuration of the heartless uncharacterized place there was
not one gracious inequality to lean against not a ledge to rest elbow
upon not a panel not even a stovepipe hole to become dearly familiar
to the wistful eye not so much as a genial crack in the plastering or
a companionable rattle in a casement or a little human obstinacy in a
door to base some kind of an acquaintance upon and make one less lonely
Through the grim untwinkling windows gaping sullenly the wrong way
with iron shutters came a discouraged light strained through the
narrow intervals of the dusty roofs above to discover a large
coffincolored desk surmounted by ghastly busts of HERVEY KEBLE and
BLAIR3 a smaller desk over which hung a picture of the Tomb of
WASHINGTON and at which sat a pallid assistanteditor in deep mourning
opening the comic contributions received by last mail a still smaller
desk for the nominal writer of subscriptionwrappers files of the
Evangelist Observer and Christian Union hanging along the wall a
dead carpet of churchyardgreen on the floor and a print of Mr PARKE
GODWIN just above the mantel of momumental marble
Upon finding themselves in this temple of Momus and observing that its
peculiar arrangement of sunshine made their complexions look as though
they had been dead a few days Gospeler SIMPSON and the Flowerpot
involuntarily spoke in whispers behind their hands
Does that room belong to your establishment also BENTHAM whispered
the Gospeler pointing rather fearfully as he spoke towards a
sidedoor leading apparently into an adjoining apartment
Yes was the low response
Is thereis there anybody dead in there whispered Mr SIMPSON
tremulously
NoNot yet
Then whispered the Ritualistic clergyman you might step in there
Miss POTTS and have your interview with Miss PENDRAGON whom Mr
BENTHAM will I am sure cause to be summoned from upstairs
The assistanteditor of the Comic Paper stealing softly from the office
to call the other young lady down Mr JEREMY BENTHAM made a sign that
FLORA should follow him to the supplementary room indicated his
lowspirited manner being as though he had said If you wish to look at
the body miss I will now show you the way
Leaving the Gospeler lost in dark abstraction near the black mantel the
Flowerpot allowed the sexton of the establishment to conduct her
funereally into the place assigned for her interview and stopped aghast
before a huge black object standing therein
Whats this she gasped almost hysterically
Only a safe said Mr BENTHAM with inexplicable bitterness of tone
Merely our fireandburglarproof receptacle for the money constantly
pouring in from firstclass American Comic journalismHere Mr
BENTHAM slapped his forehead passionately checked something like a sob
in his throat and abruptly returned to the main office
Scarcely however had he closed the door of communication behind him
when another door opening from the hall was noiselessly unlatched and
MAGNOLIA PENDRAGON glided into the arms of her friend
FLORA murmured the Southern girl I can scarcely credit my eyes It
seems so long since we last met Youve been getting a new bonnet I
see
Its like an absurd dream responded the Flowerpot wonderingly
caressing her Ive thought of you and your poor ridiculous brother
twenty times a day How much you must have gone through here Are they
wearing skirts full or scant this season
About medium dear But how do you happen to be here in Mr BENTHAMS
office
In answer to this question FLORA related all that bad happened at
Bumsteadville and since her flight from thence concluding by warning
MAGNOLIA that her possession of a black alpaca waist slightly worn
had subjected her to the ominous suspicion of the Ritualistic organist
I scorn and defy the suspicions of that enemy of the persecuted South
and highhanded wooer of exclusively Northern women exclaimed Miss
PENDRAGON vehemently Is this Mr BENTHAM married
I suppose not
Is he visiting any one
I shouldnt think so dear
Then added MAGNOLIA thoughtfully if dear Mr DIBBLE approves he
might be a friend to MONTGOMERY and myself and by being so near us
protect us both from Mr BUMSTEAD Just think dear FLORA what heaps of
sorrow I should endure if that base mans suspicion about my alpaca
waist should be only a pretence to frighten me into ultimately
receiving his addresses
I dont think theres any danger love said Miss POTTS rather
sharply
Why FLORA precious
Oh because hes so absurdly fastidious you know about regularity of
features in women
More than he is about brains I should think dear from what you tell
me of his making love to you
Here both young ladies trembled very much and said they never never
would have believed it of each other and were only reconciled when
FLORA sobbed that she was a poor unmarried orphan and Miss PENDRAGON
moaned piteously that an unwedded Southern girl without money had better
go away somewhere in the desert with her crushed brother and die at
once for their downtrodden section Then indeed they embraced
tearfully and in proof of the perfect restoration of their devoted
friendship agreed never to marry if they could avoid it and told each
other the prices of all their best clothes
You wont tell your brother that Ive been here said the
Flowerpot Im so absurdly afraid that he cant help blaming me for
causing some of his trouble
Cant I tell him even if it would serve to amuse him in his
desolation asked the sister persuasively I want to see him smile
again just as he does some days when a handorganmans monkey climbs
up to our windows from the street
Well you may tell him then you absurd thing returned FLORA
blushing and with another embrace they parted and the deeply
momentous interview was over

BY ICHABOD BOGGS
THE NEW AMERICAN POET
PREFATORY NOTEThe reader is requested to judge the following
production mildly as it is the first effort of a youthful genius 16
years old in looks and feeling 42 by the family bible and census The
author has felt that America should have a new kind of verse of its own
and he thinks he here offers one which has never been used by any other
mortal poet It is called the duodekameter Perhaps it may be proper to
add that the following is poetry
I
You see everybody in our town was running around getting fat jobs
and positions and picking up a million dollars or so
So I felt it incumbent on me
To shake myself up and see if there wasnt a good butter firkin well
filled loafing around idle in which could conveniently locate my
centre of gravity and so I said to myself Ill go
To Washington and see
Says ICHABOD BOGGS says I
II
Now dont you see you might just as well ask for a big position at
first and then take what you can get
At least that has been my rule so far
For as I says to myself if you can only get a very high position with
a sort of nabobs salary and lots of perquisites running in
annually you neednt do anything you bet
But puff at your cigar
Says ICHABOD BOGGS says I
III
So I put on my best clothes and a sort of a big blue necktie
and shortly thereafter showed myself to Mr GRANT
And said that there had been quite enough
Of this giving away big offices to people who hadnt big reputations
and that he had other fish to fry and that as he wouldnt give the
Custom House to my son Id take it myself and then I stopped
and he looked I shant
But all he said waspuff
Says General GRANT says he
IV
Then all the smoke got in my nose and I sneezed and snorted a bit
and then I just simply remarked and said
That he neednt go and get into a huff
And if he didnt like to give me that office couldnt he make me
Minister to England as I was a big feeder or if that didnt suit
why if hed do it I wouldnt object to being Minister to Cuba
when the Cubans had been all killed and were thoroughly dead
But all be said waspuff
Says General GRANT says he
V
Well then I got kind of discouraged but I thought that Id better try
again and not get up so far
But ask for what hed give beyond doubt
So I asked for a position as night watchman at the Navy Yard and
thought Id get it and hed answer my request for Id noticed that
his Havana was gradually growing smaller and he did answer me
