the subject of extreme divergencies of judgment among critics The
first systematic anarchist as he is called by Professor Saintsbury
aroused bitter contention with his writings during his own lifetime and
his opponents have remained so prejudiced that even the staid
bibliographer Allibone in his Dictionary of English Literature a
place where one would think the most flagitious author safe from
animosity speaks of Godwins private life in terms that are little less
than scurrilous Over against this persistent acrimony may be put the
fine eulogy of Mr C Kegan Paul his biographer to represent the
favourable judgment of our own time whilst I will venture to quote one
remarkable passage that voices the opinions of many among Godwins most
eminent contemporaries
In The Letters of Charles Lamb Sir TN Talfourd says
Indifferent altogether to the politics of the age Lamb could
not help being struck with productions of its newborn energies
so remarkable as the works and the character of Godwin He
seemed to realise in himself what Wordsworth long afterwards
described the central calm at the heart of all agitation
Through the medium of his mind the stormy convulsions of society
were seen silent as in a picture Paradoxes the most daring
wore the air of deliberate wisdom as he pronounced them He
foretold the future happiness of mankind not with the
inspiration of the poet but with the grave and passionless
voice of the oracle There was nothing better calculated at once
to feed and to make steady the enthusiasm of youthful patriots
than the high speculations in which he taught them to engage on
the nature of social evils and the great destiny of his species
No one would have suspected the author of those wild theories
which startled the wise and shocked the prudent in the calm
gentlemanly person who rarely said anything above the most
gentle commonplace and took interest in little beyond the
whisttable
WILLIAM GODWIN 17561836 was son and grandson of Dissenting ministers
and was destined for the same profession In theology he began as a
Calvinist and for a while was tinctured with the austere doctrines of
the Sandemanians But his religious views soon took an unorthodox turn
and in 1782 falling out with his congregation at Stowmarket he came up
to London to earn his bread henceforward as a man of letters In 1793
Godwin became one of the most famous men in England by the publication
of his Political Justice a work that his biographer would place side
by side with the Speech for Unlicensed Printing the Essay on
Education and Emile as one of the unseen levers which have moved
the changes of the times Although the book came out at what we should
call a prohibitive price it had an enormous circulation and brought
its author in something like 1000 guineas In his first novel Caleb
Williams which was published the next year he illustrated in scenes
from real life many of the principles enunciated in his philosophical
work Caleb Williams went through a number of editions and was
dramatized by Colman the younger under the title of The Iron Chest It
has now been out of print for many years Godwin wrote several other
novels but one alone is readable now St Leon which is
philosophical in idea and purpose and contains some passages of
singular eloquence and beauty
Godwin married the authoress of the Rights of Woman Mary
Wollstonecraft in 1797 losing her the same year Their daughter was
the gifted wife of the poet Shelley He was a social man particularly
fond of whist and was on terms of intimacy and affection with many
celebrated men and women Tom Paine Josiah Wedgwood and Curran were
among his closest male friends while the story of his friendships with
Mrs Inchbald Amelia Opie with the lady immortalized by Shelley as
Maria Gisborne and with those literary sisters Sophia and Harriet Lee
authors of the Canterbury Tales has a certain sentimental interest
Afterwards he became known to Wordsworth Coleridge and Lamb He
married Mrs Clairmont in 1801 His later years were clouded by great
embarrassments and not till 1833 was he put out of reach of the worst
privations by the gift of a small sinecure that of yeoman usher of the
Exchequer He died in 1836
Among the contradictory judgments passed on Caleb Williams by Godwins
contemporaries those of Hazlitt Sir James Mackintosh and Sir T N
Talfourd were perhaps the most eulogistic whilst De Quincey and Allan
Cunningham criticized the book with considerable severity Hazlitts
opinion is quoted from the Spirit of the Age
A masterpiece both as to invention and execution The romantic
and chivalrous principle of the love of personal fame is
embodied in the finest possible manner in the character of
Falkland as in Caleb Williams who is not the first but the
second character in the piece we see the very demon of
curiosity personified Perhaps the art with which these two
characters are contrived to relieve and set off each other has
never been surpassed by any work of fiction with the exception
of the immortal satire of Cervantes
Sir Leslie Stephen said of it the other day
It has livedthough in comparative obscurityfor over a
century and high authorities tell us that vitality prolonged
for that period raises a presumption that a book deserves the
title of classicNational Review February 1902
To understand how the work came to be written and its aim it is
advisable to read carefully all three of Godwins prefaces more
particularly the last and the most candid written in 1832 This will I
think dispose of the objection that the story was expressly constructed
to illustrate a moral a moral that as Sir Leslie Stephen says eludes
him He says
I formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that
should in some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest
Pursuing this idea I invented first the third volume of my
tale then the second and last of all the first I bent
myself to the conception of a series of adventures of flight and
pursuit the fugitive in perpetual apprehension of being
overwhelmed with the worst calamities and the pursuer by his
ingenuity and resources keeping his victim in a state of the
most fearful alarm This was the project of my third volume
He goes on to describe in more detail the dramatic and impressive
situations and the fearful events that were to be evolved making it
pretty clear that the purpose somewhat vaguely and cautiously outlined
in the earliest preface was rather of the nature of an afterthought
Falkland is not intended to be a personification of the evils caused by
the social system nor is he put forward as the inevitable product of
that system The readers attention is chiefly absorbed by the
extraordinary contest between Caleb Williams and Falkland and in the
tragic situations that it involves Compared with these the denunciation
of the social system is a matter of secondary interest but it was
natural that the author of the Political Justice with his mind
preoccupied by the defects of the English social system should make
those defects the evil agencies of his plot As the essential
conditions of the series of events as the machinery by which everything
is brought about these defects are of the utmost importance to the
story It is the accused system that awards to Tyrrel and Falkland their
immense preponderance in society and enables them to use the power of
the law for the most nefarious ends Tyrrel does his cousin to death and
ruins his tenant a man of integrity by means of the law This is the
occasion of Falklands original crime His more heinous offence the
abandonment of the innocent Hawkinses to the gallows is the consequence
of what Godwin expressly denounces punishment for murder I conceived
it to be in the highest degree absurd and iniquitous to cut off a man
qualified for the most essential and extensive utility merely out of
retrospect to an act which whatever were its merits could not be
retrieved Then a new element is imported into the train of causation
Calebs insatiable curiosity and the strife begins between these
wellmatched antagonists the man of wealth and station utilizing all
the advantages granted him by the state of society to crush his enemy
Godwin then was justified in declaring that his book comprehended a
general view of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by which
man becomes the destroyer of man Such were the words of the original
preface which was suppressed for a short time owing to the fears caused
by the trial of Horne Tooke Thomas Holcroft and other revolutionists
with whom Godwin was in profound sympathy Had he intended Caleb
Williams however from its first inception to be an imaginative
version of the Political Justice he would have had to invent a
different plan and different characters The arguments of a sociological
novel lack cogency unless the characters are fairly representative of
average mankind Godwins principal actors are both to say the least
exceptional They are lofty idealizations of certain virtues and powers
of mind Falkland is like Jean Valjean a superhuman creature and
indeed Caleb Williams may well be compared on one side with Les
Miserables for Victor Hugos avowed purpose likewise was the
denunciation of social tyranny But the characteristics that would have
weakened the implied theorem had such been the main object are the
very things that make the novel more powerful as drama of a grandiose
spiritual kind The high and concentrated imagination that created such
a being as Falkland and the intensity of passion with which Calebs
fatal energy of mind is sustained through that long despairing
struggle are of greater artistic value than the mechanical symmetry by
which morals are illustrated

PREFACE
BY THE AUTHOR
The following narrative is intended to answer a purpose more general and
important than immediately appears upon the face of it The question now
afloat in the world respecting THINGS AS THEY ARE is the most
interesting that can be presented to the human mind While one party
pleads for reformation and change the other extols in the warmest terms
the existing constitution of society It seemed as if something would be
gained for the decision of this question if that constitution were
faithfully developed in its practical effects What is now presented to
the public is no refined and abstract speculation it is a study and
delineation of things passing in the moral world It is but of late that
the inestimable importance of political principles has been adequately
apprehended It is now known to philosophers that the spirit and
character of the Government intrudes itself into every rank of society
But this is a truth highly worthy to be communicated to persons whom
books of philosophy and science are never likely to reach Accordingly
it was proposed in the invention of the following work to comprehend
as far as the progressive nature of a single story would allow a
general review of the modes of domestic and unrecorded despotism by
which man becomes the destroyer of man If the author shall have taught
a valuable lesson without subtracting from the interest and passion by
which a performance of this sort ought to be characterised he will have
reason to congratulate himself upon the vehicle he has chosen

This preface was withdrawn in the original edition in compliance with
the alarms of booksellers Caleb Williams made his first appearance in
the world in the same month in which the sanguinary plot broke out
against the liberties of Englishmen which was happily terminated by the
acquittal of its first intended victims in the close of that year
Terror was the order of the day and it was feared that even the humble
novelist might be shown to be constructively a traitor

LONDON
November 20 1832
CALEB WILLIAMS has always been regarded by the public with an unusual
degree of favour The proprietor of THE STANDARD NOVELS has therefore
imagined that even an account of the concoction and mode of writing of
the work would be viewed with some interest
I finished the Enquiry concerning Political Justice the first work
which may be considered as written by me in a certain degree in the
maturity of my intellectual powers and bearing my name early in
January 1793 and about the middle of the following month the book was
published It was my fortune at that time to be obliged to consider my
pen as the sole instrument for supplying my current expenses By the
liberality of my bookseller Mr George Robinson of Paternoster Row I
was enabled then and for nearly ten years before to meet these
expenses while writing different things of obscure note the names of
which though innocent and in some degree useful I am rather inclined
to suppress In May 1791 I projected this my favourite work and from
that time gave up every other occupation that might interfere with it
My agreement with Robinson was that he was to supply my wants at a
specified rate while the book was in the train of composition Finally
I was very little beforehand with the world on the day of its
publication and was therefore obliged to look round and consider to
what species of industry I should next devote myself
I had always felt in myself some vocation towards the composition of a
narrative of fictitious adventure and among the things of obscure note
which I have above referred to were two or three pieces of this nature
It is not therefore extraordinary that some project of the sort should
have suggested itself on the present occasion
But I stood now in a very different situation from that in which I had
been placed at a former period In past years and even almost from
boyhood I was perpetually prone to exclaim with Cowley
What shall I do to be for ever known
And make the age to come my own
But I had endeavoured for ten years and was as far from approaching my
object as ever Everything I wrote fell deadborn from the press Very
often I was disposed to quit the enterprise in despair But still I felt
ever and anon impelled to repeat my effort
At length I conceived the plan of Political Justice I was convinced
that my object of building to myself a name would never be attained by
merely repeating and refining a little upon what other men had said
even though I should imagine that I delivered things of this sort with a
more than usual point and elegance The world I believed would accept
nothing from me with distinguishing favour that did not bear upon the
face of it the undoubted stamp of originality Having long ruminated
upon the principles of Political Justice I persuaded myself that I
could offer to the public in a treatise on this subject things at once
new true and important In the progress of the work I became more
sanguine and confident I talked over my ideas with a few familiar
friends during its progress and they gave me every generous
encouragement It happened that the fame of my book in some
inconsiderable degree got before its publication and a certain number
of persons were prepared to receive it with favour It would be false
modesty in me to say that its acceptance when published did not nearly
come up to everything that could soberly have been expected by me In
consequence of this the tone of my mind both during the period in
which I was engaged in the work and afterwards acquired a certain
elevation and made me now unwilling to stoop to what was insignificant
I formed a conception of a book of fictitious adventure that should in
some way be distinguished by a very powerful interest Pursuing this
idea I invented first the third volume of my tale then the second and
last of all the first I bent myself to the conception of a series of
adventures of flight and pursuit the fugitive in perpetual apprehension
of being overwhelmed with the worst calamities and the pursuer by his
ingenuity and resources keeping his victim in a state of the most
fearful alarm This was the project of my third volume I was next
called upon to conceive a dramatic and impressive situation adequate to
account for the impulse that the pursuer should feel incessantly to
alarm and harass his victim with an inextinguishable resolution never
to allow him the least interval of peace and security This I
apprehended could best be effected by a secret murder to the
investigation of which the innocent victim should be impelled by an
unconquerable spirit of curiosity The murderer would thus have a
sufficient motive to persecute the unhappy discoverer that he might
deprive him of peace character and credit and have him for ever in
his power This constituted the outline of my second volume
The subject of the first volume was still to be invented To account
for the fearful events of the third it was necessary that the pursuer
should be invested with every advantage of fortune with a resolution
that nothing could defeat or baffle and with extraordinary resources of
intellect Nor could my purpose of giving an overpowering interest to my
tale be answered without his appearing to have been originally endowed
with a mighty store of amiable dispositions and virtues so that his
being driven to the first act of murder should be judged worthy of the
deepest regret and should be seen in some measure to have arisen out of
his virtues themselves It was necessary to make him so to speak the
tenant of an atmosphere of romance so that every reader should feel
prompted almost to worship him for his high qualities Here were ample
materials for a first volume
I felt that I had a great advantage in thus carrying back my invention
from the ultimate conclusion to the first commencement of the train of
adventures upon which I purposed to employ my pen An entire unity of
plot would be the infallible result and the unity of spirit and
interest in a tale truly considered gives it a powerful hold on the
reader which can scarcely be generated with equal success in any other
way
I devoted about two or three weeks to the imagining and putting down
hints for my story before I engaged seriously and methodically in its
composition In these hints I began with my third volume then proceeded
to my second and last of all grappled with the first I filled two or
three sheets of demy writingpaper folded in octavo with these
memorandums They were put down with great brevity yet explicitly
enough to secure a perfect recollection of their meaning within the
time necessary for drawing out the story at full in short paragraphs of
two three four five or six lines each
I then sat down to write my story from the beginning I wrote for the
most part but a short portion in any single day I wrote only when the
afflatus was upon me I held it for a maxim that any portion that was
written when I was not fully in the vein told for considerably worse
than nothing Idleness was a thousand times better in this case than
industry against the grain Idleness was only time lost and the next
day it may be was as promising as ever It was merely a day perished
from the calendar But a passage written feebly flatly and in a wrong
spirit constituted an obstacle that it was next to impossible to
correct and set right again I wrote therefore by starts sometimes for
a week or ten days not a line Yet all came to the same thing in the
sequel On an average a volume of Caleb Williams cost me four months
neither less nor more
It must be admitted however that during the whole period bating a few
intervals my mind was in a high state of excitement I said to myself a
thousand times I will write a tale that shall constitute an epoch in
the mind of the reader that no one after he has read it shall ever be
exactly the same man that he was beforeI put these things down just
as they happened and with the most entire frankness I know that it
will sound like the most pitiable degree of selfconceit But such
perhaps ought to be the state of mind of an author when he does his
best At any rate I have said nothing of my vainglorious impulse for
nearly forty years
When I had written about seventenths of the first volume I was
prevailed upon by the extreme importunity of an old and intimate friend
to allow him the perusal of my manuscript On the second day he returned
it with a note to this purpose I return you your manuscript because I
promised to do so If I had obeyed the impulse of my own mind I should
have thrust it in the fire If you persist the book will infallibly
prove the grave of your literary fame
I doubtless felt no implicit deference for the judgment of my friendly
critic Yet it cost me at least two days of deep anxiety before I
recovered the shock Let the reader picture to himself my situation I
felt no implicit deference for the judgment of my friendly critic But
it was all I had for it This was my first experiment of an unbiassed
decision It stood in the place of all the world to me I could not and
I did not feel disposed to appeal any further If I had how could I
tell that the second and third judgment would be more favourable than
the first Then what would have been the result No I had nothing for
it but to wrap myself in my own integrity By dint of resolution I
became invulnerable I resolved to go on to the end trusting as I could
to my own anticipations of the whole and bidding the world wait its
time before it should be admitted to the consult
I began my narrative as is the more usual way in the third person But
I speedily became dissatisfied I then assumed the first person making
the hero of my tale his own historian and in this mode I have persisted
in all my subsequent attempts at works of fiction It was infinitely the
best adapted at least to my vein of delineation where the thing in
which my imagination revelled the most freely was the analysis of the
private and internal operations of the mind employing my metaphysical
dissecting knife in tracing and laying bare the involutions of motive
and recording the gradually accumulating impulses which led the
personages I had to describe primarily to adopt the particular way of
proceeding in which they afterwards embarked
When I had determined on the main purpose of my story it was ever my
method to get about me any productions of former authors that seemed to
bear on my subject I never entertained the fear that in this way of
proceeding I should be in danger of servilely copying my predecessors I
imagined that I had a vein of thinking that was properly my own which
would always preserve me from plagiarism I read other authors that I
might see what they had done or more properly that I might forcibly
hold my mind and occupy my thoughts in a particular train I and my
predecessors travelling in some sense to the same goal at the same time
that I struck out a path of my own without ultimately heeding the
direction they pursued and disdaining to inquire whether by any chance
it for a few steps coincided or did not coincide with mine
Thus in the instance of Caleb Williams I read over a little old
book entitled The Adventures of Mademoiselle de St Phale a French
Protestant in the times of the fiercest persecution of the Huguenots
who fled through France in the utmost terror in the midst of eternal
alarms and hairbreadth escapes having her quarters perpetually beaten
up and by scarcely any chance finding a moments interval of security
I turned over the pages of a tremendous compilation entitled Gods
Revenge against Murder where the beam of the eye of Omniscience was
represented as perpetually pursuing the guilty and laying open his most
hidden retreats to the light of day I was extremely conversant with the
Newgate Calendar and the Lives of the Pirates In the meantime no
works of fiction came amiss to me provided they were written with
energy The authors were still employed upon the same mine as myself
however different was the vein they pursued we were all of us engaged
in exploring the entrails of mind and motive and in tracing the various
rencontres and clashes that may occur between man and man in the
diversified scene of human life
I rather amused myself with tracing a certain similitude between the
story of Caleb Williams and the tale of Bluebeard than derived any
hints from that admirable specimen of the terrific Falkland was my
Bluebeard who had perpetrated atrocious crimes which if discovered
he might expect to have all the world roused to revenge against him
Caleb Williams was the wife who in spite of warning persisted in his
attempts to discover the forbidden secret and when he had succeeded
struggled as fruitlessly to escape the consequences as the wife of
Bluebeard in washing the key of the ensanguined chamber who as often
as she cleared the stain of blood from the one side found it showing
itself with frightful distinctness on the other
When I had proceeded as far as the early pages of my third volume I
found myself completely at a stand I rested on my arms from the 2nd of
January 1794 to the 1st of April following without getting forward in
the smallest degree It has ever been thus with me in works of any
continuance The bow will not be for ever bent
Opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum
I endeavoured however to take my repose to myself in security and not
to inflict a set of crude and incoherent dreams upon my readers In the
meantime when I revived I revived in earnest and in the course of
that month carried on my work with unabated speed to the end
Thus I have endeavoured to give a true history of the concoction and
mode of writing of this mighty trifle When I had done I soon became
sensible that I had done in a manner nothing How many flat and insipid
parts does the book contain How terribly unequal does it appear to me
From time to time the author plainly reels to and fro like a drunken
man And when I had done all what had I done Written a book to amuse
boys and girls in their vacant hours a story to be hastily gobbled up
by them swallowed in a pusillanimous and unanimated mood without
chewing and digestion I was in this respect greatly impressed with the
confession of one of the most accomplished readers and excellent critics
that any author could have fallen in with the unfortunate Joseph
Gerald He told me that he had received my book late one evening and
had read through the three volumes before he closed his eyes Thus what
had cost me twelve months labour ceaseless heartaches and industry
now sinking in despair and now roused and sustained in unusual energy
he went over in a few hours shut the book laid himself on his pillow
slept and was refreshed and cried
Tomorrow to fresh woods and pastures new
I had thought to have said something here respecting the concoction of
St Leon and Fleetwood But all that occurs to me on the subject
seems to be anticipated in the following
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION
February 14 1805
Yet another novel from the same pen which has twice before claimed the
patience of the public in this form The unequivocal indulgence which
has been extended to my two former attempts renders me doubly
solicitous not to forfeit the kindness I have experienced
One caution I have particularly sought to exercise not to repeat
myself Caleb Williams was a story of very surprising and uncommon
events but which were supposed to be entirely within the laws and
established course of nature as she operates in the planet we inhabit
The story of St Leon is of the miraculous class and its design to
mix human feelings and passions with incredible situations and thus
render them impressive and interesting
Some of those fastidious readersthey may be classed among the best
friends an author has if their admonitions are judiciously
consideredwho are willing to discover those faults which do not offer
themselves to every eye have remarked that both these tales are in a
vicious style of writing that Horace has long ago decided that the
story we cannot believe we are by all the laws of criticism called upon
to hate and that even the adventures of the honest secretary who was
first heard of ten years ago are so much out of the usual road that not
one reader in a million can ever fear they will happen to himself
Gentlemen critics I thank you In the present volumes I have served you
with a dish agreeable to your own receipt though I cannot say with any
sanguine hope of obtaining your approbation
The following story consists of such adventures as for the most part
have occurred to at least one half of the Englishmen now existing who
are of the same rank of life as my hero Most of them have been at
college and shared in college excesses most of them have afterward run
a certain gauntlet of dissipation most have married and I am afraid
there are few of the married tribe who have not at some time or other
had certain small misunderstandings with their wivesA To be sure
they have not all of them felt and acted under these trite adventures as
my hero does In this little work the reader will scarcely find anything
to elevate and surprise and if it has any merit it must consist in
the liveliness with which it brings things home to the imagination and
the reality it gives to the scenes it pourtrays
Footnote A I confess however the inability I found to weave a
catastrophe such as I desired out of these ordinary incidents What I
have here said therefore must not be interpreted as applicable to the
concluding sheets of my work
Yes even in the present narrative I have aimed at a certain kind of
noveltya novelty which may be aptly expressed by a parody on a
wellknown line of Pope it relates
Things often done but never yet described
In selecting among common and ordinary adventures I have endeavoured to
avoid such as a thousand novels before mine have undertaken to develop
Multitudes of readers have themselves passed through the very incidents
I relate but for the most part no work has hitherto recorded them If
I have hold them truly I have added somewhat to the stock of books
which should enable a recluse shut up in his closet to form an idea of
what is passing in the world It is inconceivable meanwhile how much
by this choice of a subject I increased the arduousness of my task It
is so easy to do a little better or a little worse what twenty
authors have done before If I had foreseen from the first all the
difficulty of my project my courage would have failed me to undertake
the execution of it
Certain persons who condescend to make my supposed inconsistencies the
favourite object of their research will perhaps remark with exultation
on the respect expressed in this work for marriage and exclaim It was
not always thus referring to the pages in which this subject is
treated in the Enquiry concerning Political Justice for the proof of
their assertion The answer to this remark is exceedingly simple The
production referred to in it the first foundation of its authors claim
to public distinction and favour was a treatise aiming to ascertain
what new institutions in political society might be found more
conducive to general happiness than those which at present prevail In
the course of this disquisition it was enquired whether marriage as it
stands described and supported in the laws of England might not with
advantage admit of certain modifications Can anything be more distinct
than such a proposition on the one hand and a recommendation on the
other that each man for himself should supersede and trample upon the
institutions of the country in which he lives A thousand things might
be found excellent and salutary if brought into general practice which
would in some cases appear ridiculous and in others be attended with
tragical consequences if prematurely acted upon by a solitary
individual The author of Political Justice as appears again and
again in the pages of that work is the last man in the world to
recommend a pitiful attempt by scattered examples to renovate the face
of society instead of endeavouring by discussion and reasoning to
effect a grand and comprehensive improvement in the sentiments of its
members
