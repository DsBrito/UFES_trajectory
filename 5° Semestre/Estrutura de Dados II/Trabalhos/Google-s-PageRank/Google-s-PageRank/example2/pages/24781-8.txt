NEW FOES FOR OLD
With the dissolution of the AustroHungarian army the Serbs and Croats
and Slovenes saw that one other obstacle to their longhopedfor union
had vanished The dream of centuries was now a little nearer towards
fulfilment But many obstacles remained There would presumably be
opposition on the part of the Italian and Roumanian Governments for it
was too much to hope that these would waive the treaties they had wrung
from the Entente and would consent to have their boundaries regulated
by the wishes of the people living in disputed lands Some individual
Italians and Roumanians might even be less reasonable than their
Governments If Austria and Hungary were in too great a chaos to have
any attitude as nations there would be doubtless local opposition to
the Yugoslavs And as soon as the Magyars had found their feet they
would be sure to bombard the Entente with protestations setting forth
that subject nationalities were intended by the Creator to be subject
nationalities A large pamphlet The Hungarian Nation was issued at
BudaPest in February 1920 It displayed a very touching solicitude for
the Croats whom the Serbs would be sure to tyrannize most horribly If
only Croatia would remain in the Hungarian State says Mr A Kovacs
Ministerial Councillor in the Hungarian Central Statistical Office then
the Magyars would instantly bestow on her both Bosnia which belonged to
the Empire as a whole and Dalmatia which belonged to Austria That is
the worst of being a Ministerial Statistical Councillor Another
gentleman Professor Dr Fodor has the bright idea that the race is
the multitude of individuals who inhabit one uniform region
Passing to Yugoslavias domestic obstacles it was impossible to think
that all the Serbs and Croats and Slovenes would forthwith subscribe to
the Declaration of Corfu and become excellent Yugoslavs Some would be
honestly unable to throw off what centuries had done to them and
realize that if they had been made so different from their brothers
they were brothers still For ten days there was a partly domestic
partly foreign obstacle but as the King of Montenegro did not take his
courage in both hands and descend on the shores of that country with an
Italian army he lost his chance for ever
ROUMANIAN ACTIVITIES
There was indeed far less trouble from the Roumanian than from the
Italian side On October 29 1918 one could say that all military power
in the Banat was at an end The Hungarian army took what food it wanted
and made off leaving everywhere in barracks and in villages guns
rifles ammunition Vainly did the officers attempt to keep their men
together And scenes like this were witnessed all over the Banat Then
suddenly on Sunday November 3 the Roumanians that is the Roumanians
living in the country made attacks on many villages and the Roumanians
of Transylvania acted in a similar fashion With the Hungarian equipment
and with weapons of their own they started out to terrorize Among their
targets were the village notaries in whom was vested the administrative
authority At Old Moldava on the Danube they decapitated the notary a
man called Kungel and threw his head into the river At a village near
Anina they buried the notary except for his head which they proceeded
to kick until he died Nor did they spare the notaries of Roumanian
origin which made it seem as if this outbreak of lawlessnessdirected
from who knows wherehad the high political end of making the country
appear to the Entente in such a desperate condition that an army must be
introduced and as the Serbs were thought to be a long way off with the
railways and the roads before them ruined by the Austrians it looked as
if Roumanias army was the only one available On the Monday and the
Tuesday these Roumanian freebooters who had all risen on the same day
in regions extending over hundreds of square kilometres started
plundering the large estates Near Bela Crkva on the property of Count
BissingenNippenburg a German they did damage to the sum of eight and
a half million crowns At the monastery of Mevsica near Vervsac
the Roumanians of a neighbouring village devastated the archimandrates
large library sacked the chapel and smashed his beehives so that they
were not impelled by poverty and hunger In the meantime there had been
formed at Vervsac a National Roumanian Military Council The placard
printed of course in Roumanian is dated Vervsac November 4 and is
addressed to The Roumanian Officers and Soldiers born in the Banat
and announces that they have formed the National Council It is a
Council we are told in which one can have every confidence moreover
it is prepared to cooperate in every way with a view to maintaining
order in launtra si in afara both internal and external
The subjoined names of the committee are numerous they range from
LieutColonel Gavriil Mihailov and Major Petru Jucu downwards to a
dozen privates The archimandrate who fortunately happened to be at his
house in Vervsac begged his friend Captain Singler of the
gendarmerie to take some steps About twenty Hungarian officers
undertook to go with a machine gun to the monastery on November 7 at
eleven on the previous night Mihailov ordered the captain to come to see
him he wanted to know by whom this expedition had been authorized The
captain answered that Mevsica was in his district and that he had no
animus against Roumanians but only against plunderers After his arrival
at Mevsica the trouble was brought to an end Nor was it long before
the Serbian troops riding up through their own country at a rate which
no one had foreseen crossed the Danube and occupied the Banat in
conjunction with the French The rapidity of this advance astounded the
Roumanians they gaped like Lavengro when he wondered how the stones
ever came to Stonehenge When the Serbian commandant at Vervsac
invited these enterprising Roumanian officers to an interview he was
asked by one of them Major Iricu whether or not they were to be
interned What made you print that placard asked the commandant and
they replied that their object had been to preserve order They had not
imagined so they said that the Serbs would come so quickly I will be
glad said the commandant if you will not do this kind of thing any
more
THE ITALIAN FRAME OF MIND
Italy was not in a good humour She was well aware that in the countries
of her Allies there was a marked tendency to underestimate her
overwhelming triumphs of the last days of the War Perhaps those
exploits would have been more difficult if Austrias army had not
suffered a deterioration but still one does not take 300000 prisoners
every day Some faithful foreigners were praising Italyand she
deserved itfor having persevered at all after Caporetto That disaster
had been greatly due to filling certain regiments with several thousand
munition workers who had taken part in a revolt at Turin and then
concentrating these regiments in the Caporetto salient which was the
most vulnerable sector in the eastern Italian front How much of the
disaster was due to the Vatican will perhaps never be known But as for
the uneducated easily impressed peasants of the army it was wonderful
that all except the second army and a small part of the third
retreated with such discipline in view of what they had been brooding on
before the day of Caporetto They had such vague ideas what they were
fighting for and if the Socialists kept saying that the English paid
their masters to continue with the Warhow were they to know what was
the truth The British regiments who were received not merely with
cigars and cigarettes and flowers and with little palm crosses which
their trustful little weavers had blessed but also with showers of
stones as they passed through Italian villages in 1917 must have
sometimes understood and pardoned Then the troops were in distress
about their relatives for things were more and more expensive and
where would it end In face of these discouragements it was most
admirable that the army and the nation rallied and reconstituted their
morale
SENSITIVENESS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR ARMY
Of course one should not generalize regarding nations except in vague
or very guarded terms but possibly it would not be unjust to say that
the Italians apart from those of northern provinces and of Sardinia
have too much imagination to make firstclass soldiers And they are too
sensitive as you could see in an Italian military hospital Their task
was also not a trifling oneto stand for all those months in territory
so forbidding And there would have been more sympathy with the Italians
in the autumn of 1918 if they had not had such very crushing triumphs
when the War was practically over What was the condition of the
Austrian army About October 15 in one section of the front35
kilometres separating the extreme points from one anotherthe following
incidents occurred the Army Command at St Vitto issued an order to the
officers invariably to carry a revolver since the men were now
attacking them a Magyar regiment revolted and marched away under the
command of a SecondLieutenant whom they had elected at Stino di
Livenza while the officers were having their evening meal two hand
grenades were thrown into the mess by soldiers at Codroipo a regiment
revolted attacked the officers mess and wounded several of the people
there including the general in command Such was the Austrian army in
those days and it was only human if comparisons were madenot making
any allowances for Italys economic difficulties her coal her social
and her religious difficultiesbut merely bald comparisons were made
between these wholesale victories against the Austrians as they were in
the autumn of 1918 and the scantier successes of the previous years In
September 1916 when the eighth or ninth Italian offensive had pierced
the Austrian front and the Italians reached a place called Provachina
Marshal Boroevic had only one reserve division The heavy artillery
was withdrawn the light artillery was packed up the company commanders
having orders to retire in the night Only a few rapidfire batteries
were left with a view to deceiving the enemy But as the Italians
appeared to the Austrians to have no heart to come onthere may have
been other reasonsthe artillery was unpacked and the Austrians
returned to their old front In May 1917 between Monte Gabriele and
Doberdo Boroevic had no reserve battalion his troops in full
marching kit had to defend the whole front they were able to do so by
proceeding now to this sector and now to that No army is immune from
serious mistakesWe won in 1871 said Bismarck although we made
very many mistakes because the French made even morebut the
Yugoslavs in the Austrian army could not forget such incidents as that
connected with the name of Professor Pivko This gentleman who is now
living at Maribor was made the subject of a book Der Verrath bei
Carzano The Treachery near Carzano which was published by the
Austrian General Staff His battalion commander was a certain
LieutColonel Vidale who was a first cousin of the CO General
Vidale and when an orderly overheard Pivko who is a Slovene and
several Czech officers discussing a plan which would open the front to
the Italians he ran all the way to the Generals headquarters and gave
the information The General telephoned to his cousin who said that the
allegation was absurd and that Pivko was one of his best officers The
orderly was therefore thrown into prison and Pivko having turned off
the electricity from the barbed wires and arranged matters with a
Bosnian regiment made his way to the Italians The suggestion is that
owing to the lie of the land and the weak Austrian forces it was
possible for the Italians to reach Trent anyhow the Austrians were
amazed when they ceased to advance and the German regiment which was in
Trent did not have to come out to defend it Everyone in the Austrian
army recognized that the Italian artillery was preeminent and that the
officers were most gallant especially in the early part of the War
when one would frequently find an officer lying dead with no men near
him But such episodes as the abovementionedit would be possible but
wearisome to describe otherscould not but have some effect on the
opposing army and would be recalled when the Italians sang their final
panegyric The reasons for the Austrian debacle on the Piave are as
follows when the Allied troops had reached Rann Susegana Ponte di
Piave and Montiena the Austrian High Command decided on October 24 to
throw against them the 36th Croat division the 21st Czech the 44th
Slovene a German division and the 12th Croat Regiment of Uhlans
However the 16th and 116th Croat the 30th Regiment of Czech Landwehr
and the 71st Slovene Landwehr Regiment declared that they would not
fight against the French and English and instead of advancing
retired The 78th Croat Regiment as well as three other Czech
Regiments abandoned the front after having made a similar declaration
At the same time the 96th and 135th Croat Regiments in agreement with
the Czech detachments made a breach for the Italians on the left wing
at Stino di Livenza while Slav marching formations revolted at Udine
The AustroHungarian troops consequently had to retreat No one
expects of the Italian army as a whole that it will be on a level
with the best but when the British officers who were with the Serbs on
the Salonica front compare their reminiscences with those of the British
officers on the Italian front it is improbable that garlands will be
strewn for the Italians Towards the end of October a plan was adopted
by the British and Italian staffs for capturing the island of Papadopoli
in the Piave this island about three miles in length formed the
outpost line of the Austrian defences On the night of October 2324 an
attack was to be made by the 2nd HAC while three companies of the
1st Royal Welsh Fusiliers were to act as reserve This operation is most
vividly described by the Senior Chaplain of the 7th Division the Rev
E C Crosse DSO MC1 and he says nothing as to what occurred
on that part of the island which was to be seized by the Italians Well
nothing had occurred for the Italians did not get across and when the
water rose they said they could do nothing on that night These are the
words of Mr Crosses footnote The obvious question What was going
to be done with the farther half of the island we have purposely left
undiscussed here This half was outside the area of the 7th Division
and as such it falls outside the scope of this work for the time being
The subsequent capture of the whole island on the following night by
the 7th Division was not part of the original plan Afterwards when a
crossing was made to the mainland the left flank was unsupported as
the Italians did not cross the river and thus the 23rd Division had its
flank exposed A belief is entertained that the Italian cavalry is one
of the best in the world evidently it is not the best for on that
Piave front where thousands of Italian cavalry were available the only
ones who put in their appearance early in the battle were three hundred
very warstained Northampton Yeomanry
The record of the Italian troops in the field renders unnecessary an
assertion of their courage says Mr Anthony Dell2 for reckless
bravery in assault none surpasses them But when you have said that you
have nearly summed up their military virtues for discipline is not
their strong suit and they have little sense of responsibility On the
other hand we must remember their admirable patience but the great
mass of the people have not attained the level of Christianity they are
savage both in heart and mind with no outlook wider than that of the
family It is the Italian proletariat which is judged by the Yugoslavs
whose otherwise acute discernment has been warped by the unhappy
circumstances of the time Indifferent to the fact that he himself is a
compound of physical energy and oriental mysticism the Yugoslav has
become inclined to contemplate merely the physical side of the Italian
and for the most part that portion of it which has to do with war The
Italian longsightedness and prudence and business capacity are ignored
save in so far as they delayed the countrys entrance into the Great
War The sensitiveness and artistic attributes of the Italians who gaze
with aching hearts upon the glories of a sunset are but rarely felt by
Serbs who gather brushwood for the fire that is to roast their
suckingpig and who sit down to watch the operation haply with their
backs turned to the sunset The Yugoslav especially the Serb is a man
from the Middle Ages brought suddenly into the twentieth century With
his heroic heart and his wonderful strength he fails to understand those
people who on account of one reason or another have no passion for
war And as the military deeds of the Italians have had such effect upon
the minds of the Yugoslavs we have alluded to them at a greater length
than would otherwise have been profitable The Yugoslavs despise the
Italians Also the Italians who concern themselves with diplomacy are
conscious that their keen wits and their long training in the wiles of
the civilized world their old traditions and their prestige give them a
considerable advantage over the Yugoslav diplomat so that this kind of
Italian despises the Yugoslav He knows very well that the French or
British statesmen do not amid the smoke of afterdinner cigars esteem
his case by the same standard as that which they apply to the case which
the ordinary Yugoslav diplomat presents to them in office hours As for
the wider Italian circles one must fear that the old hatred of Germany
because the Germans seemed to despise them will henceforward colour the
sentiments with which they regard the Yugoslavs It is a state of things
between these neighbours which other people cannot but view with
apprehension
AN UNFORTUNATE NAVAL AFFAIR
There was in Yugoslav naval circles no very cordial feeling for the
Italians The Austrian dreadnought Viribus Unitis was torpedoed in a
most ingenious fashion by two resolute officers Lieutenant Raffaele
Paolucci a doctor and Major Raffaele Rossetti In October 1917 they
independently invented a very small and light compressedair motor which
could be used to propel a mine into an enemy harbour They submitted
their schemes to the Naval Inventions Board were given an opportunity
of meeting and after three months had brought their invention into a
practical form The naval authorities however refused to allow them to
go on any expedition till they both were skilled longdistance swimmers
Six months had thus to be dedicated entirely to swimming At the end of
that time they were supplied with a motorboat and two bombs of a
suitable size for blowing up large airships To these bombs were fixed
the small motors by means of which they were to be propelled into the
port of Pola while the two men swimming by their side would control
and guide them Just after nightfall on October 31 1918 the raiders
arrived outside Pola
Were they aware that anything had happened in the AustroHungarian navy
On October 26 there appeared in the Hrvatski List of Pola a summons to
the Yugoslavs made by the Executive Committee of Zagreb which had been
elected on the 23rd This notice in the newspaper recommended the
formation of local committees and asked the Yugoslavs in the meantime
to eschew all violence When RearAdmiral then Captain Methodius
Kochwhose mother was an Englishwomanread this at noon he thought it
was high time to do something Koch had always been one of the most
patriotically Slovene officers of the Austrian navy On various
occasions during the War he had attempted to hand over his ships to the
Italians and when some other Austrian commander signalled to ask him
why he was cruising so near to the Italian coast he invariably answered
I have my orders He found it however impossible to give himself up
as the Italians whom he sighted no matter how numerous they were would
never allow him to come within signalling range Koch had frequently
spoken to his Slovene sailors preparing them for the day of liberation
and he was naturally very popular among them Let us not forget that
such an officer true to his own people was in constant peril of being
shot
WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT POLA
On the afternoon of that same day October 26th when the
AustroHungarian Empire with its army and navy was collapsing Admiral
Horthy an energetic honest if not brilliant Magyar the Commander of
the Fleet at Pola called to his flagship the Viribus Unitis one
officer representing each nationality of the Empire Koch was there on
behalf of the Slovenes The Admiral announced that a wholesale mutiny
had been planned for November 1st during which the ships treasuries
would be robbed and he asked these officers to collaborate with him in
preventing it Koch at the Admirals request wrote out a speech that
he would deliver to the Slovenes and this document with one or two
notes in the Admirals writing is in Kochs possession If you will
not listen to your Admirals then so ran the speech you should
listen to our national leaders He addressed himself to the men of
course in the Slovene language as a fellowcountryman He begged them
to keep quiet He deprecated all plundering firstly in order that their
good name should not be sullied and also pointing out that the
neighbouring population was overwhelmingly Slovene Out of 45000 men
only 2000 could leave by rail he therefore asked them all to stay
peacefully at Pola Meanwhile the local committee had been formed Koch
was secretly a member of it and on the 28th RearAdmiral Cicoli a
kindly old gentleman who was portcommandant advised Koch to join it as
liaisonofficer It was on the 28th at eight in the morning that the
officers who had been selected to calm the different nationalities
started to go round the fleet That officer who spoke to the Germans
declared that one must not abandon hopes of victory and that anyhow the
War would soon be over Count Thun who discoursed to the Czechs was
illadvised enough to make the Deity their Kaiser and their oath the
main subjects of his remarks so that he was more than once in great
danger of being thrown overboard Koch went first of all to the Viribus
Unitis but the mutiny had begun a bugle was sounded for a general
assembly it was ignored and the crew let it be known that they were
weary of the old game which consisted of the officers egging on one
nation against another This mutiny had not yet spread to the remaining
ships and on them the speeches were delivered At the National Assembly
that evening Koch was chosen as chief of National Defence he thereupon
went to Cicoli and formally asked to be allowed to join the committee
When Vienna refused its assent Koch resigned his commission By this
time all discipline had gone by the board no one thought of such a
thing as office work and amid the chaos sailors councils appeared
with which Koch had to treat The situation was made no easier by the
presence of large numbers of Germans Magyars and Italians of whom the
latter also formed a National Council On the 30th Koch as chief of
National Defence asked Admirals Cicoli and Horthy to come at 9 pm to
the Admiralty with a view to the transference of the military power At
730 in the municipal building there was a joint meeting of the
Yugoslav and the Italian National Councils and so many speeches were
made that the Admirals had to be asked to postpone their appearance for
two hours and at eleven oclock with the street well guarded against a
possible outbreak on the part of any loyal troops the whole Yugoslav
committee accompanied by one member of the Italian committee went to
the Admiralty Horthy had gone home but Cicoli and his whole staff were
waiting The old gentleman was informed that he no longer had any power
in his hands he was asked to give up his post to Koch and this he was
prepared to do It is not so hard for me now he said as I have
meanwhile received a telegram from His Majesty ordering me and at
this point he produced the paper to give up Pola to the Yugoslavs
The affair had apparently been settled between nine and eleven oclock
Cicoli was ready to sign the protocol but out of courtesy to a
chivalrous old man this was left undone after all there were witnesses
enough
During the night of October 30th31st a radiogram destined for President
Wilson was composed Together with the Czechs the Slovaks and the Poles
and in understanding it said with the Italians we have taken over the
fleet and Pola the warharbour and the forts It asked for the dispatch
of representatives of such Entente States as were disinterested in the
local national question But now a telegram was received from Zagreb
announcing that Dr Ante TresicPavivcic of the chief National
Council would be at Pola at 8 am and that pending his arrival no
wireless was to be sent out Dr TresicPavivcic3 poet and
deputy for the lower Dalmatian islands had always been in spite of his
indifferent health one of the most strenuous fighters for Yugoslavia Two
years of the War he spent in an Austrian prison but on his release he
managed to travel up and down Croatia and Dalmatia inciting the Yugoslav
sailors to revolt many of them had already read a speech by this
silvertongued deputy in the Reichsrath a speech of which the reading and
circulation had been forbidden as a crime of high treason About 9 am of
the 31st there was a meeting on board the Viribus Unitis between
TresicPavivcic and Koch There was a brief ceremony the leader of
the Sailors Council handing over the vessel to the deputy as representing
the National Council of Serbs Croats and Slovenes Admiral Horthy in his
cabin likewise drew up a procesverbal to the same effect saying that
he was authorized to do this by the Emperor and he supported his statement
by the production of a wireless message Koch urged on the doctor the
necessity of sending the abovementioned wireless to Wilson The news of
this great event says TresicPavivcic in an article in the
Balkan Review May 1919 was dispatched to all the Powers by wireless
But unfortunately he seems whether on his own responsibility or that of
Zagreb to have prevented Koch from sending it on that day Captain Janko
de Vukovic Podkapelski was then placed in command of the fleet though
the Sailors Council at first declined to accept him He was at heart a
patriot but had taken no active part in Yugoslav propaganda and unluckily
for himself he had been compelled to accompany Count Tisza in his recent
illstarred tour of Bosnia when the Magyar leader made a last attempt to
browbeat the local Slavs Yet as no other high officer was available Koch
told the Sailors Council that they simply must acknowledge Vukovic and
at 4 pm he took over the command the Yugoslav flag being hoisted on all
the vessels simultaneously to the accompaniment of the Croatian national
anthem and the firing of salutes
THE STORY OF THE VIRIBUS UNITIS
Three hours previously to this a torpedoboat with Paolucci and
Rossetti on board had sailed from Venice and at ten oclock in the
evening as Paolucci tells us4 he and his companion after a certain
amount of embracing handshaking saluting and loyal exclamations
plunged into the water The first obstacle was a wooden pier upon which
sentries were marching to and fro this was safely passed by means of
two hats shaped like bottles which Paolucci and Rossetti now put on
The bombs were submerged and thus the sentry saw nothing but a couple
of bottles being tossed about by the waves A row of wooden beams
bearing a thin electric wire had then to be negotiated and the last
obstacle consisted of half a dozen steel nets which had laboriously to
be disconnected from the cables which held them It was now nearly six
oclock the two men cautiously approached the Viribus Unitis and
fixed one of their bombs just below the waterline underneath the
ladder conducting to the deck Paolucci simply records without comment
that the ship was illuminated perhaps he and his friend were too tired
to make the obvious deduction that the hourlyexpected end of the War
had really arrived A number of officers from other ships had remained
on the Viribus Unitis after the previous evenings ceremony but the
lookout seeing the Italians in the water must have thought it was
eccentric of them to come swimming out at this hour to join in the
festivities A motorlaunch soon picked them up and they were brought on
board the flagship Viva lItalia they shouted for they were proud
of dying for their country Viva lItalia replied some of the crew to
this pair of allied officers When they were conducted to Captain
Vukovic they told him that his vessel would in a short time be blown
up The order was given to abandon ship and Paolucci and his friend
relate5 that when they asked the captain if they might also try to
save themselves he shook them both by the hand saying that they were
brave men and that they deserved to live So they plunged into the water
and swam rapidly away but a few minutes later they were picked up by a
launch and taken back the captain having suddenly begun to suspect
they said that the story of the bomb was untrue They were again made
to walk up the ladder under which lay the explosives It was then 628
The ladder was crowded with sailors who were also returning to their
ship Run run for your lives shouted Paolucci At last his foot
touched the deck and then he and Rossetti ran as fast as they could to
the stern Hardly had they got there than a terrific explosion rent the
air and a column of water shot three hundred feet straight up into the
sky Paolucci and Rossetti were again in the water and looking back
they saw a man scramble up the side of the vessel which had now turned
completely over with her keel uppermost There on the keel stood this
man with folded arms It was Vukovic who had insisted on going down
with his ship About fifty other men were killed
When Koch came out of his house feeling that there must be no more
delay in sending the radiogram to President Wilson a young Italian
Socialist ran up to him in the street and told him of the fate of the
flagship As the news spread everyone thought it must be the work of
some Austrian officers It was feared that they would explode the
arsenal and that would have meant the destruction of the whole town
Amid the uproar and chaos Koch had placards distributed saying that
the Viribus Unitis had been torpedoed by two Italians who were in
custody And then the wireless was sent to Paris
The two officers were taken to the Admiralty and then placed on the
dreadnought Prince Eugene it being rumoured that the Italians of Pola
