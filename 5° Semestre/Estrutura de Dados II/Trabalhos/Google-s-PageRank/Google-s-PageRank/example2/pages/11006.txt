setting and tapping it level
turning with the wheelbarrow
graceful sweating
freed
of every moment

For Rob
Handsome Rob
Half the women hate you
the other half
will give you anything
Deep in Nam
your buddy shot tracheotomy
He died happy you told me
he believed I was going to
save him
Perhaps he knew
he would lie in your arms
forever
Too Big
Listening to Schubert
while GreatAunt Hannah
embroiders on the wall
and darkness closes
what have we come to
Weve gone wrong
too big
to find our way by song
light
falling on a face
and handkerchief
illumination
in the manner
of Rembrandt
Peters Answer
Little Blue Heron young still white
by the north causeway bridge
stick legs too thin
for the swelling body
the visual weight of feathers
stepping slowly in shallow water
long toes trailing limply then
extending three splayed forward
one back Brilliant neck
curving poised Dagger beak
the same gray as legs and toes
Why is nature beautiful
The lust for pattern Peter said
The herons head rose and twisted
circular eye light brown orange
rimmed ancient intelligence
asking a different question
I was unmoving not dangerous
The heron turned to hunt
brush a cloud above the river

Wallys Poem
Dolphins surge up and under
Mozarts soprano

Wallace Klitgaard
Epitome of Splendor
ants sun ones lot
He typed it himself
showed it to me on the bus
38 years ago
He was grinning
the glad no age
that we become bent
to making clumsy prayer
Morning Maine Honolulu
Early mist breaking
on low tide mud smell
Ducks the small birds
the rooster down the road
begin to sing the air
the light the whole
enormous chance
grateful as the old people
reclaiming Pauahi Street
seeing each other in doorways
after the night
I Would
In 1948
I walked all the way
to 14th Street
to buy a bow and arrow
It was 30 cents I had 29
The woman sold it to me anyway
and I was free and happy
on Sixth Avenue
as any Indian
If I could find her tonight
I would keep death far away
For Anita Bartlett
Too Late
Why cannot blue be enough
Light in the sky dark in the sea
the shades between
The green of fields
red clover buttercups
Bridal white of apple blossoms
burial earth hawks feather snakeskin
Monarchs Anita
feeding on purple aster
fluttering up
sun glowing orange brown bronze
through black edged wings twenty
joining twenty joining a hundred
down up over from
color to color
to Mexico
Clouds booming over
the washed woods
blue sun Finn eats
chop suey from a pot
while I shave
Six months to dismantle
the dead rooms of a marriage
down to a borrowed tent
patches of snow and invisibly
all around us sap rising
in its own sweet time

fire and peace in your cheeks
preparing for the further
steppes of feeling
Back In Town
Billy Fraillys got a new shirt
shaved and walking down the road
ready for anything
When I was in fifth grade
Billy powered his bike up Church Hill
black Stetson yellow kerchief
I helped him shovel out Mrs Cowells
parking place He did most of the work
but he split the money fiftyfifty
Hes an outcast now
no frontier he can reach
But hes not crying and we know
there is no virtue only consequence
and the sometimes music
of a new shirt
Woodstock
Bluejay Feather
Bluejay feather
in the grass
Something was here
once
A flash of color
a harsh cry
and it was gone
The feather remains
tough precise
useful

Talking To Myself
Early dark blue one jet trail
arching past Venus
snow coming tomorrow
My mother
unable to move
Hit it down the road seven hours
stand by her bed
acknowledge the bond of blood
the sensitivity
she could never handle
that I have ridden to beauty
beyond all expectation
Wilson Street
Low gray sky
Cold Still
Christmas tree upside down
tinsel on dirty snow
A yellow balloon
bounces slowly
across Wilson Street
A black cat
glides three steps up
turns in a doorway

On Looking At A Mediocre Painting
Thin paint No passion
We would agree I know
although we met only once
some things are in the blood

Every Moment
Sun warms
one side of the alley
A young woman smiles at me
surprised by her new beauty
Sex tenderness cobblestones
Once I was a Venetian
with my last gold coin
Once I broke my vows
and left the Order
Arms around her legs
the blue milk crate
on which she sits the
kitchen door propped open
with a mopevery moment
like this
Portland
For Tamey
Drove over the bridge today
saw the water far below
and once again imagined
your last jump
desperation pain relief
a twist of gallantry
across your face
your final bow to the truth
you always told me to tell
You sure as hell saved my life
Tamey I could never say goodbye
I miss you I wish
you could have played with Finnegan
Rough cloth
the gathering of giant ferns
woven together supple bending
energy moving up your spine
mind dancing in the night
Palm Tree Exercise
Kailua
The Early Ones
Black night turns dark blue
a wedge of lighter blue
dim gray
Outposts on the beach
become aware of each other
narrow stones
aligned to the east
grouped around a driftwood stick
sixteen inches high
In an hour
sheltered by grass overhanging
edge of the continent
they will cast long thin shadows
they will be first
brave against the day

Have a good trip Dad
Late Breakfast
Red nails
gold cigarette
young pampered mouth
hair drawn back
a sense of having reached
her limits
a perfect twentytwo
There was a moment
when she chose all this
I must begin again
without shame

Spring Dream of SueSue
Perfectly quiet
a trout lets me hold him
You surface laughing
dark hair
blue shirt unbuttoned
March
Lament For Paul
Scratching your beard excited
Fantastic you said about
the Beatles new record
The next night you played
your own shy songs surprising us
You were crushed beneath your car
but your songs Paul I heard them
We all heard them
Woodstock
For Coyote
I think of you drinking dancing
unable to sleep reading until first light
a blanket drawn around your shoulders
afternoons working your wheel until
the time to mingle with true hearts
raise glasses hug laugh
help as you can
We are all dying slower or faster
but it hurts to watch
And out of the numb exuberant wreckage of your days
come these raku pots
graceful open shapes lines freely
scratched into the clay deep turquoise
copper glazes extravagant surprised
too beautiful for tears
After Months
Shifting unstable air
patches of light
raindrops standing on
the candy red gas tank
of a Kawasaki 750
Coming down harder
bouncing off the seat
dripping from the tips
of black rubber handgrips
tach speedometer needles
resting on their zero pegs
twin mirrors focused back

TIMES LONG AGO WILL PRESENT
A SPECIAL TREASURE TO YOU
A moment whole again
To see more clearly Trudi 17
washing in the Woodland Valley
stream Tamey
giving me another nickel
to play pinball
Barbaras smile wanting a child
My grandfathers arm levering
a floor board skin hanging
from his biceps cord
holding while I nailed
So many treasures I cant quite see
Wrecking Ball Commercial Street
Salmon streaks of pulverized brick
white pigment tar nicked and scarred
in every direction patina of blows
on a mute obdurate interior
Six weeks I carried it until
the beautiful surface cast off
weightless The iron opened from
the inside out and like a new bell
began to sing
For Elena
The Polynesian Navigator
Swells current
sky rimmed
shell on a stick chart
promise of land
alone and
singing
Kahunas Way
Twisting through high cane
silver green tossing in the trade winds
toward the mountain wall
dark green jagged deep shadows
where a warrior prayed
ancient silence Kahunas way
beyond King Sugar
and the city that is coming
Hulemalu Road
Kauai
41 In The Honolulu Public Library
Like beautiful fish
moving slowly through coral
they eddy through the library
dark hair bright dark eyes
the wisdom of their mothers
lying gravely on their faces
ready to love to stay
they flick away
on currents deep and proper
For Catherine someday
in a quiet hour wondering
what is possible
When I hold your mother
while she holds me
all that was is
the future comes
moment to moment
complete
For this salmon swim
their river elephants
remember wild geese
call out at dusk
I fought and risked
trusted and betrayed
How can you find another
before you find yourself
traveling the hearts way
alone unsure knowing only
that you must
Rages Place
Put your forehead
on the ground and
pound your fists
Curl on your side
close your eyes
scream silently
You will not be
answered No
But your cries
your cries will be
clothes and flowers
honor
for the journey

The Purkinje Shift

violet peace

Bee Fantasy
Reaching high on
the shoulders
of thinner air
rising with the Queen
the view the view mating
falling and falling
back to meadow
the warm dark
first light
dancing out the maps
The American Way
F18s screaming down
wing tip to wing tip
brave lethal steady nerve
Johnny Copelands lead guitar
ripping through the air
taking us faster inverting 6 Gs
dark forehead sweat hot and loose
Face at the bar arched eyebrows
black hair back wide mouth
brooding sensual slightly battered
Fighters blues man beauty
power at the edge
the American way
