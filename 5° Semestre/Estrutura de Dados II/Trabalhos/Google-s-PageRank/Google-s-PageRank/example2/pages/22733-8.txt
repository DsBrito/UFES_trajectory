PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION
A new edition of this little volume having been rendered necessary I
have availed myself of the opportunity thus afforded me by the
publishers to revise it Some slight revision was necessary to correct
one or two errors which crept unavoidably into the earlier edition By
an oversight an important typographical blunder went uncorrected into
the former edition making the date of the first use of the word
Socialism 1835 instead of 1833 That error I regret to say has been
subsequently copied into many important publications Even more
important were some errors in the biographical sketch of Marx in
Chapter III These were not due to any carelessness upon the part of the
present writer but were reproduced from standard works upon what
seemed to be good authoritythat of his youngest daughter and his
intimate friend the late Wilhelm Liebknecht It is now known with
certainty that the father of Karl Marx embraced Christianity of his own
free choice and not in obedience to an official edict
These and some other minor changes having to be made I took the time to
rewrite large parts of the volume making such substantial changes in
it as to constitute practically a new book The chapter on Robert Owen
has been recast and greater emphasis placed upon his American career and
its influence in Chapter IV the sketch of the Materialistic Conception
of History has been enlarged somewhat special attention being given to
the bearing of the theory upon religion All the rest of the book has
been changed partly to meet the requirements of many students and
others who have written to me in reference to various points of
difficulty and partly also to state some of my own ideas more
successfully I venture to hope that the brief chapter on Means of
Realization which has been added to the book by way of postscript
will in spite of its brevity and the fact that it was not written for
inclusion in this volume prove helpful to some who read the book
The thanks of the writer are due to all those friendsSocialists and
otherswhose kindly efforts made the earlier edition of the book a
success

SOCIALISM
A SUMMARY AND INTERPRETATION OF
SOCIALIST PRINCIPLES
SOCIALISM
CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
I
It is not a long time since the kindest estimate of Socialism by the
average man was that expressed by Ebenezer Elliott the CornLaw
Rhymer in the once familiar cynical doggerel
What is a Socialist One who is willing
To give up his penny and pocket your shilling
There was another view brutally unjust and unkind expressed in
bloodcurdling cartoons representing the Socialist as a bombthrowing
assassin According to the one view Socialists were all sordid envious
creatures yearning for the
Equal division of unequal earnings
while the other view represented them as ready to enforce this selfish
demand by means of the cowardly weapons of the assassin
Both these views are now happily wellnigh extinct There is still a
great deal of misconception of the meaning of Socialism the ignorance
concerning it which is manifested upon every hand is often
disheartening but neither of these puerile misrepresentations is
commonly encountered in serious discussion It is true that the average
newspaper editorial confounds Socialism with Anarchism often enlisting
the prejudice which exists against the most violent forms of Anarchism
in attacking Socialism though the two systems of thought are
fundamentally opposed to each other it is likewise true that Socialists
are not infrequently asked to explain their supposed intention to have a
great general dividingup day for the equal distribution of all the
wealth of the nation The Chancellor of a great American university
returns from a sojourn in Norway and naively hastens to inform the
world that he has refuted Socialism by asking the members of some
poor struggling sect of Communists what would happen to their scheme of
equality if babies should be born after midnight of the day of the equal
division of wealth
Recognizing it to be the supreme issue of the age the Republican Party
in its national platform1 defines Socialism as meaning equality of
ownership as against equality of opportunity notwithstanding the fact
that every recognized exponent of Socialism would deny that Socialism
means equality of ownership or that it goes beyond equality of
opportunity that the voluminous literature of Socialism teems with
unequivocal and unmistakable disavowals of any desire for the periodic
divisions of property and wealth which alone could make equality of
ownership possible for brief periods
Still when all this has been said it must be added that these
criticisms do not represent the attitude of the mass of people toward
the Socialist movement to the same extent as they once did In serious
discussions of the subject among thinking people it is becoming quite
rare to encounter either of the two criticisms named Most of those who
seriously and honestly discuss the subject know that modern Socialism
comprehends neither assassination nor the equal division of wealth The
enormous interest manifested in Socialism during recent years and the
steady growth of the Socialist vote throughout the world bear witness to
the fact that the views expressed in the satirical distich of the poets
fancy and the bloodcurdling cartoon of the artists invention are no
longer the potent appeals to prejudice they once were
The reason for the changed attitude of the public toward the Socialist
movement and the Socialist ideal lies in the growth of the movement
itself There are many who would change the order of this proposition
and say that the growth of the Socialist movement is a result of the
changed attitude of the public mind toward it In a sense both views
are right Obviously if the public mind had not revised its judgments
somewhat we should not have attained our present strength and
development but it is equally obvious that if we had not grown if we
had remained the small and feeble band we once were the public mind
would not have revised its judgments much if at all It is easy to
enlist prejudice against a small body of men and women when they have no
powerful influence and to misrepresent and vilify them
But it is otherwise when that small body has grown into a great body
with farreaching influence and power So long as the Socialist movement
in America consisted of a few poor workingmen in two or three of the
largest cities most of them foreigners it was very easy for the
average man to accept as true the wildest charges brought against them
But when the movement grew and developed a powerful organization with
branches in almost every city and a wellconducted press of its own it
became a very different matter The sixteen years from 1888 to 1904 saw
the Socialist vote in the United States grow steadily from 2068 in the
former year to 442402 in the latter Europe and America together had in
1870 only about 30000 votes but by 1906 the number had risen to
considerably over 7000000 These figures constitute a vital challenge
to the thoughtful and earnest men and women of the world
It is manifestly impossible for a great worldwide movement numbering
its adherent by millions and having for its advocates many of the
foremost thinkers artists and poets of the world to be based upon
either sordid selfishness or murderous hate and envy If that were true
if it were possible for such a thing to be true the most gloomy
forebodings of the pessimist would fall far short of the real measure of
Humanitys impending doom It is estimated that no less than thirty
million adults are at present enrolled in the ranks of the Socialists
throughout the world and the number is constantly increasing This vast
army drawn from every part of the civilized world comprising men and
women of all races and creeds is not motivated by hate or envy but by
a consciousness that in their hands and the hands of their fellows rests
the power to win greater happiness for themselves Incidentally their
unity for this purpose is perhaps the greatest force in the world today
making for international peace
Still notwithstanding the millions enlisted under the banner of
Socialism the word is spoken by many with the pallid lips of fear the
scowl of hate or the amused shrug of contempt while in the same land
people of the same race facing the same problems and perils speak it
with glad voices and hopelit eyes Many a mother crooning over her babe
prays that it may be saved from the Socialism to which another with
equal mother love looks as her childs heritage and hope And with
scholars and statesmen it is much the same With wonderful unanimity
agreeing that in the words of Herbert Spencer Socialism will come
inevitably in spite of all opposition they yet differ in their
estimates of its character and probable effects upon the race quite as
much as the unlearned One welcomes and another fears one envies the
unborn generations another pities To one the coming of Socialism means
the coming of Human Brotherhood the long long quest of Humanitys
choicest spirits to another it means the enslavement of the world
through fear
Many years ago Herbert Spencer wrote an article on The Coming Slavery
which conveyed the impression that the great thinker saw what he thought
to be signs of the inevitable triumph of Socialism All over the world
Socialists were cheered by this admission from their implacable enemy
In this connection it is worthy of note that Spencer continued to
believe in the inevitability of Socialism In October 1905 a
wellknown Frenchman M G Davenay visited Mr Spencer and had a long
conversation with him on several subjects Socialism among them Soon
after his return he received a letter on the subject from Mr Spencer
written in French which was published in the Paris Figaro a few days
after Mr Spencers death in December 1905 two months or thereabouts
from the time of the interview which called it forth2 After some
brief reference to his health Mr Spencer wrote The opinions I have
delivered here before you and which you have the liberty to publish
are briefly these 1 Socialism will triumph inevitably in spite of
all opposition 2 its establishment will be the greatest disaster
which the world has ever known 3 sooner or later it will be brought
to an end by a military despotism
Anything more terrible than this black pessimism which clouded the
latter part of the life of the great thinker it would be difficult to
imagine After living his long life of splendid service to the cause of
intellectual progress and studying as few men have ever done the
history of the race he went down to his grave fully believing that the
world was doomed to inevitable disaster How different from the
confidence of the poet3 foretelling
A wonderful day acoming when all shall be better than well
The last words of the great French Utopist SaintSimon were The
future is ours And thousands of times his words have been echoed by
those who believing equally with Herbert Spencer that Socialism must
come have seen in the prospect only the fulfillment of the agelong
dream of Human Brotherhood Men as profound as Spencer and as sincere
rejoice at the very thing which blanched his cheeks and filled his heart
with fear
There is then a widespread conviction that Socialism will come and in
coming vitally affect for good or ill every life Millions of earnest
men and women have enlisted themselves beneath its banner in various
lands and their number is steadily growing In this country as in
Europe the spread of Socialism is one of the most evident facts of the
age and its study is therefore most important What does it mean and
what does it promise or threaten are questions which civic duty
prompts The day is not far distant when ignorance of Socialism will be
regarded as a disgrace and neglect of it a civic wrong No man can
faithfully discharge the responsibilities of his citizenship until he is
able to give an answer to these questions to meet intelligently the
challenge of Socialism to the age
II
The word Socialism is admittedly one of the noblest and most inspiring
words ever born of human speech Whatever may be thought of the
principles for which it is the accepted name or of the political
parties which contend for those principles no one can dispute the
beauty and moral grandeur of the word itself I refer not merely of
course to its etymology but rather to its spiritual import Derived
from the Latin word socius meaning a comrade it is like the word
mother for instance one of those great universal speech symbols
which find their way into every language
Signifying as it does faith in the comradeship of man as the basis of
social existence prefiguring a social state in which there shall be no
strife of man against man or nation against nation it is a verbal
expression of a great ideal mans loftiest aspirations crystallized
into a single word The old Hebrew prophets dream of a
worldrighteousness that shall give peace when nations shall beat
their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks4
and the Angelsong of Peace and Goodwill in the legend of the Nativity
mean no more than the word Socialism in its best usage means Plato
spiritual son of the Socrates who for truths sake drained the hemlock
cup to its dregs dreamed of such social peace and unity and the line
of those who have seen the same vision of a lovewelded world has never
been broken More and Campanella SaintSimon and Owen Marx and Engels
Morris and Bellamyand the end of the prophetic line is not yet
But if the dream the hope itself is old the word is comparatively
new It is hard to realize that the word which means so much to
countless millions of human beings and which plays such a part in the
vital discussions of the world in every civilized country is no older
than many of those whose lips speak it with reverence and hope Yet such
is the fact Because it will help us to a clearer understanding of
modern Socialism and because too it is little known notwithstanding
its intensely interesting character let us linger awhile over that page
of history which records the origin of this noble word
Some years ago anxious to settle if possible the vexed question of
the origin and first use of the word Socialism the present writer
devoted a good deal of time to an investigation of the subject spending
much of it in a careful survey of all the early nineteenthcentury
radical literature It soon appeared that the generally accepted account
of its introduction by the French writer L Reybaud in 1840 was
wrong Indeed when once fairly started on the investigation it seemed
rather surprising that the account should have been accepted
practically without challenge for so long Finally the conclusion was
reached that an anonymous writer in an English paper was the first to
use the word in print the date being August 24 18335 Since that
time an investigation of a commendably thorough nature has been made by
three students of the University of Wisconsin6 with the result that
they have been unable to find any earlier use of the word It is
somewhat disappointing that after thus tracing the word back to what may
well be its first appearance in print it should be impossible to
identify its creator
The letter in which the term is first used is signed A Socialist and
it is quite evident that the writer uses it as a synonym for the
commonly used term Owenite by which the disciples of Robert Owen were
known It is most probable that Owen himself had used the word and to
some extent made it popular and that the writer of the letter had
heard our dear social father as Owen was called use it either in
some of his speeches or in conversation This is the more likely as Owen
was fond of inventing new words At any rate one of Owens associates
now dead told the present writer that Owen often specifically claimed
to have used the word at least ten years before it was adopted by any
other writer
The word gradually became more familiar in England Throughout the years
18351836 in the pages of Owens paper The New Moral World there
are many instances of the word occurring The French writer Reybaud in
his Reformateurs Modernes published in 1840 made the term equally
familiar to the reading public of Continental Europe By him it was
used to designate the teachings not merely of Owen and his followers
but those of all social reformers and visionariesSaintSimon Charles
Fourier Louis Blanc and others By an easy transition it soon came
into general use as designating all altruistic visions theories and
experiments from the Republic of Plato onward through the centuries
In this way much confusion arose The word became too vague and
indefinite to be distinctive It was appliedfrequently as an
epithetindiscriminately to persons of widely differing and often
conflicting views Every one who complained of social inequalities
every dreamer of social Utopias was called a Socialist The
enthusiastic Christian pleading for a return to the faith and practices
of primitive Christianity and the aggressive atheist proclaiming
religion to be the bulwark of the worlds wrongs the State worshiper
who would extol Law and spread the net of government over the whole of
life and the iconoclastic Anarchist who would destroy all forms of
social authority have all alike been dubbed Socialists by their
friends no less than by their opponents
The confusion thus introduced has had the effect of seriously
complicating the study of Socialism from the historical point of view
Much that one finds bearing the name of Socialism in the literature of
the middle of the nineteenth century for example is not at all
related to Socialism as that term is understood today Thus the
Socialists of the present day who do not advocate Communism regard as
a classic presentation of their views the famous pamphlet by Karl Marx
and Friederich Engels The Communist Manifesto They have circulated
it by millions of copies in practically all the languages of the
civilized world Yet throughout it speaks of Socialists with
illconcealed disdain and always in favor of Communism and the
Communist Party The reason for this is clearly explained by Engels
himself in the preface written by him for the English edition but that
has not prevented many an unscrupulous opponent of Socialism from
quoting the Communist Manifesto of Marx and Engels against the
Socialists of the MarxEngels school7 In like manner the utterances
and ideas of many of those who formerly called themselves Socialists
have been quoted against the Socialists of today notwithstanding that
it was precisely on account of their desire to repudiate all connection
with and responsibility for such ideas that the founders of the modern
Socialist movement took the name Communists
Nothing could be clearer than the language in which Engels explains why
the name Communist was chosen and the name Socialist discarded He
says Yet when it the Manifesto was written we could not have
called it a Socialist Manifesto By Socialists in 1847 were
understood on the one hand the adherents of the various Utopian
systems Owenites in England Fourierists in France both of these
already reduced to the position of mere sects and gradually dying out
on the other hand the most multifarious social quacks who by all
manner of tinkering professed to redress without any danger to capital
and profit all sorts of social grievances in both cases men outside of
the workingclass movement and looking rather to the educated classes
for support Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced
of the insufficiency of mere political revolution and had proclaimed the
necessity of a total social change that portion then called itself
Communist It was a crude roughhewn purely instinctive sort of
Communism still it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough
among the working class to produce the Utopian Communism in France of
Cabet and in Germany of Weitling Thus Socialism was in 1847 a
middleclass movement Communism a workingclass movement Socialism
was on the Continent at least respectable Communism was the very
opposite And as our notion from the very beginning was that the
emancipation of the working class must be the act of the working class
itself there could be no doubt as to which of the names we must take
Moreover we have ever since been far from regretting it8
There is still unfortunately much misuse of the word Socialism even
by some accredited Socialist exponents Writers like Tolstoy Ibsen
Zola and many others are constantly referred to as Socialists when
in fact they are nothing of the sort Still the word is now pretty
generally understood as defined by the Socialistsnot the Socialists
of sixty years ago who were mostly Communists but the Socialists of
