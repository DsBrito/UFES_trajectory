THE EXPOSITION OF A MECHANISM
THE LEVERS OF THE HUMAN BODY1
Sir Arthur Keith
In all the foregoing chapters we have been considering only the muscular
engines of the human machine counting them over and comparing their
construction and their mechanism with those of the internalcombustion
engine of a motor cycle But of the levers or crankpins through which
muscular engines exert their power we have said nothing hitherto Nor
shall we get any help by now spending time on the levers of a motor
cycle We have already confessed that they are arranged in a way which
is quite different from that which we find in the human machine In the
motor cycle all the levers are of that complex kind which are called
wheels and the joints at which these levers work are also circular for
the joints of a motor cycle are the surfaces between the axle and the
bushes which have to be kept constantly oiled No we freely admit that
the systems of levers in the human machine are quite unlike those of a
motor cycle They are more simple and it is easy to find in our bodies
examples of all the three orders of levers The joints at which bony
levers meet and move on each other are very different from those we find
in motor cycles Indeed I must confess they are not nearly so simple
And lastly I must not forget to mention another difference These
levers we are going to study are livingat least are so densely
inhabited by myriads of minute bone builders that we must speak of them
as living I want to lay emphasis on that fact because I did not insist
enough on the living nature of muscular engines
Illustration Fig 1Showing a chisel 10 inches long used as a lever
of the first order
We are all well acquainted with levers We apply them every day A box
arrives with its lid nailed down we take a chisel use it as a lever
pry the lid open and see no marvel in what we have done Fig 1 And
yet we thereby did with ease what would have been impossible for us even
if we had put out the whole of our unaided strength The use of levers
is an old discovery more than 1500 years before Christ Englishmen
living on Salisbury Plain applied the invention when they raised the
great stones at Stonehenge and at Avebury more than 2000 years earlier
still Egyptians employed it in raising the pyramids Even at that time
men had made great progress they were already reaping the rewards of
discoveries and inventions But none I am sure surprised them more
than the discovery of the lever by its use one man could exert the
strength of a hundred men They soon observed that levers could be used
in three different ways The instance already given the prying open of
a lid by using a chisel as a lever is an example of one way Fig 1
it is then used as a lever of the first order Now in the first order
one end of the lever is applied to the point of resistance which in the
case just mentioned was the lid of the box At the other end we apply
our strength force or power The edge of the box against which the
chisel is worked serves as a fulcrum and lies between the handle where
the power is applied and the bevelled edge which moves the resistance or
weight A pair of ordinary weighing scales also exemplifies the first
order of levers The knife edge on which the beam is balanced serves as
a fulcrum it is placed exactly in the middle of the beam which we
shall suppose to be 10 inches long If we place a 1lb weight in one
scale to represent the resistance to be overcome the weight will be
lifted the moment that a pound of sugar has been placed in the opposite
scalethe sugar thus representing the power If however we move the
knifeedge or fulcrum so that it is only 1 inch from the sugar end of
the beam and 9 inches from the weight end then we find that we have to
pour in 9 lb of sugar to equalise the 1lb weight The chisel used in
prying open the box lid was 10 inches long it was pushed under the lid
for a distance of 1 inch leaving 9 inches for use as a power lever By
using a lever in this way we increased our strength ninefold The
longer we make the power arm the nearer we push the fulcrum towards the
weight or resistance end the greater becomes our power This we shall
find is a discovery which Nature made use of many millions of years ago
in fashioning the body of man and of beast When we apply our force to
the long end of a lever we increase our power We may also apply it as
Nature has done in our bodies for another purpose We have just noted
that if the weight end of the beam of a pair of scales is nine times the
length of the sugar end that a 1lb weight will counterpoise 9 lb of
sugar We also see that the weight scale moves at nine times the speed
of the sugar scale Now it often happens that Nature wants to increase
not the power but the speed with which a load is lifted In that case
the sugar scale is placed at the long end of the beam and the weight
scale at the short end it then takes a 9lb weight to raise a single
pound of sugar but the sugar scale moves with nine times the speed of
the weight scale Nature often sacrifices power to obtain speed The arm
is used as a lever of this kind when a cricket ball is thrown
Nothing could look less like a pair of scales than a mans head or
skull and yet when we watch how it is poised and the manner in which it
is moved we find that it too acts as a lever of the first order The
fulcrum on which it moves is the atlasthe first vertebra of the spine
Fig 2 When a man stands quite erect with the head well thrown back
the ear passages are almost directly over the fulcrum It will be
convenient to call that part of the head which is behind the ear
passages the postfulcral and the part which is in front the
prefulcral Now the face is attached to the prefulcral part of the
lever and represents the weight or load to be moved while the muscles
of the neck which represent the power are yoked to the postfulcral
end of the lever The hinder part of the head serves as a crankpin for
seven pairs of neck muscles but in Fig 2 only the chief pair is drawn
known as the complex muscles When that pair is set in action the
postfulcral end of the head lever is tilted downwards while the
prefulcral end on which the face is set is turned upwards
Illustration Fig 2The skull as a lever of the first order
The complex muscles thus tilt the head backwards and the face upwards
but where are the muscles which serve as their opponents or antagonists
and reverse the movement In a previous chapter it has been shown that
every muscle has to work against an opponent or antagonist muscle Here
we seem to come across a defect in the human machine for the greater
straight muscles in the front of the neck which serve as opposing
muscles are not only much smaller but at a further disadvantage by
being yoked to the prefulcral end of the lever very close to the cup
on which the head rocks However if the greater straight muscles lose
power by working on a very short lever they gain in speed we set them
quickly and easily into action when we give a nod of recognition All
the strength or power is yoked to the postfulcral end of the head the
prefulcral end of its lever is poorly guarded Japanese wrestlers know
this fact very well and seek to gain victory by pressing up the poorly
guarded prefulcral lever of the head thus producing a deadly lock at
the fulcral joint Indeed it will be found that those who use the
jiujitsu method of fighting have discovered a great deal about the
construction and weaknesses of the levers of the human body
Merely to poise the head on the atlas may seem to you as easy a matter
as balancing the beam of a pair of scales on an upright support I am
now going to show that a great number of difficulties had to be overcome
before our heads could be safely poised on our necks The head had to be
balanced in such a way that through the pivot or joint on which it rests
a safe passageway could be secured for one of the most delicate and most
important of all the parts or structures of the human machine We have
never found a good English name for this structure so we use its clumsy
Latin oneMedulla oblongataor medulla for short In the medulla are
placed offices or centres which regulate the vital operations carried
on by the heart and by the lungs It has also to serve as a passageway
for thousands of delicate gossamerlike nerve fibres passing from the
brain which fills the whole chamber of the skull to the spinal cord
situated in the canal of the backbone By means of these delicate fibres
the brain dispatches messages which control the muscular engines of the
limbs and trunk Through it too ascend countless fibres along which
messages pass from the limbs and trunk to the brain In creating a
movable joint for the head then a safe passage had to be obtained for
the medullathat part of the great nerve stem which joins the brain to
the spinal cord The medulla is part of the brain stem
This was only one of the difficulties which had to be overcome The eyes
are set on the prefulcral lever of the head For our safety we must be
able to look in all directionsover this shoulder or that We must also
be able to turn our heads so that our ears may discover in which
direction a sound is reaching us In fashioning a fulcral joint for the
head then two different objects had to be secured free mobility for
the head and a safe transit for the medullary part of the brain stem
How well these objects have been attained is known to all of us for we
can move our heads in the freest manner and suffer no damage whatsoever
Indeed so strong and perfect is the joint that damage to it is one of
the most uncommon accidents of life
Let us see then how this triumph in engineering has been secured In
her inventive moods Nature always hits on the simplest plan possible In
this case she adopted a ballandsocket jointthe kind by which older
astronomers mounted their telescopes By such a joint the telescope
becomes just as the head is a lever of the first order The eyeglass
is placed at one end of the lever while the objectglass which can be
swept across the face of the heavens is placed at the other or more
distant end In the human body the first vertebra of the backbonethe
atlasis trimmed to form a socket while an adjacent part of the base
of the skull is shaped to play the part of ball The kind of joint to be
used having been hit upon the next point was to secure a safe passage
for the brain stem That too was worked out in the simplest fashion
The central parts of both ball and socket were cut away or to state
the matter more exactly were never formed Thus a passage was obtained
right through the centre of the fulcral joint of the head The centre of
the joint was selected because when a lever is set in motion the part at
the fulcrum moves least and the medulla being placed at that point is
least exposed to disturbance when we bend our heads backwards forwards
or from side to side When we examine the base of the skull all that we
see of the ball of the joint are two knuckles of bone Fig 3 A
covered by smooth slippery cartilage or gristle to which anatomists
give the name of occipital condyles If we were to try to complete the
ball of which they form a part we should close up the great
openingthe foramen magnumwhich provides a passageway for the brain
stem on its way to the spinal canal All that is to be seen of the
socket or cup is two hollows on the upper surface of the atlas into
which the occipital condyles fit Fig 3 B Merely two parts of the
brim of the cup have been preserved to provide a socket for the
condyles or ball
Illustration Fig 3A The opening in the base of the skull by
which the brain stem passes to the spinal canal The two occipital
condyles represent part of the ball which fits into the cup formed by
the atlas B The parts of the socket on the ring of the atlas
As we bend our heads the occipital condyles revolve or glide on the
sockets of the atlas But what will happen if we roll our heads
backwards to such an extent that the bony edge of the opening in the
base of the skull is made to press hard against the brain stem and crush
it That of course would mean instant death Such an accident has been
made impossible 1 by making the opening in the base of the skull so
much larger than the brain stem that in extreme movements there can be
no scissorslike action 2 the muscles which move the head on the
atlas arrest all movements long before the dangerpoint is reached 3
even if the muscles are caught off their guard as they sometimes are
certain strong ligamentsfastenings of tough fibresare so set as
automatically to jam the joint before the edge of the foramen can come
in contact with the brain stem
These are only some of the devices which Nature had to contrive in order
to secure a safe passageway for the brain stem But in obtaining safety
for the brain stem the movements of the head on the atlas had to be
limited to mere nodding or sidetoside bending The movements which are
so necessary to us that of turning our heads so that we can sweep our
eyes along the whole stretch of the skyline from right to left and from
left to right were rendered impossible This defect was also overcome
in a simple manner The joints between the first and second
vertebraethe atlas and axiswere so modified that a turning movement
could take place between them instead of between the atlas and skull
When we turn or rotate our heads the atlas carrying the skull upon it
swings or turns on the axis When we search for the manner in which this
has been accomplished we see again that Nature has made use of the
simplest means at her disposal When we examine a vertebra in the course
of construction within an unborn animal we see that it is really made
up by the union of four parts see Fig 4 a central block which
becomes the body or supporting part a right and a left arch which
enclose a passage for the spinal cord and lastly a fourth part in
front of the central block which becomes big and strong only in the
first vertebrathe atlas When we look at the atlas Fig 4 we see
that it is merely a ring made up of three of the partsthe right and
left arches and the fourth elementbut the body is missing A glance
at Fig 4 B will show what has become of the body of the atlas It
has been joined to the central block of the second vertebrathe
axisand projects upwards within the front part of the ring of the
atlas and thus forms a pivot round which rotatory movements of the head
can take place Here we have in the atlas an approach to the formation
of a wheela wheel which has its axle or pivot placed at some distance
from its centre and therefore a complete revolution of the atlas is
impossible A battery of small muscles is attached to the lateral levers
of the atlas and can swing it freely and the head which it carries a
certain number of degrees to both right and left The extent of the
movements is limited by stout check ligaments Thus by the simple
expedient of allowing the body of the atlas to be stolen by the axis a
pivot was obtained round which the head could be turned on a horizontal
plane
Illustration Fig 4A The original parts of the first or atlas
vertebra B Showing the body of the first vertebra fixed to the
second thus forming the pivot on which the head turns
Nature thus set up a double joint for the movements of the head one
between the atlas and axis for rotatory movements another between the
atlas and skull for nodding and sidetoside movements And all these
she increased by giving flexibility to the whole length of the neck
Makers of modern telescopes have imitated the method Nature invented
when fixing the human head to the spine Their instruments are mounted
with a double jointone for movements in a horizontal plane the other
for movements in a vertical plane We thus see that the young engineer
as well as the student of medicine can learn something from the
construction of the human body
In low forms of vertebrate animals like the fish and frog the head is
joined directly to the body there being no neck
No matter what part of the human body we examine we shall find that its
mechanical work is performed by means of bony levers Having seen how
the head is moved as a lever of the first order we are now to choose a
part which will show us the plan on which levers of the second order
work and there are many reasons why we should select the foot It is a
part which we are all familiar with every day we can see it at rest and
in action The foot as we have already noted serves as a lever in
walking It is a bent or arched lever Fig 6 when we stand on one
foot the whole weight of our body rests on the summit of the arch We
are thus going to deal with a lever of a complex kind
Illustration Fig 5Showing a chisel used as a lever of the second
order
In using a chisel to pry open the lid of a box we may use it as a lever
either of the first or of the second order We have already seen Fig
1 that in using it as a lever of the first order we pushed the handle
downwards while the bevelled end was raised forcing open the lid The
edge of the box served as a rest or fulcrum for the chisel If however
after inserting the bevelled edge under the lid we raise the handle
instead of depressing it we change the chisel into a lever of the
second order The lid is not now forced up on the bevelled edge but is
raised on the side of the chisel some distance from the bevelled edge
which thus comes to represent the fulcrum By using a chisel in this
way we reverse the positions of the weight and fulcrum and turn it into
a lever of the second order Suppose we push the side of the
chiselwhich is 10 inches longunder the lid to the extent of 1 inch
then the advantage we gain in power is as 1 to 10 we thereby increase
our strength tenfold If we push the chisel under the lid for half its
length then our advantage stands as 10 to 5 our strength is only
doubled If we push it still further for twothirds of its length then
our gain in strength is only as 10 to 66 our power is increased by
only onethird Now this has an important bearing on the problem we are
going to investigate for the weight of our body falls on the foot so
that only about onethird of the leverthat part of it which is formed
by the heelprojects behind the point on which the weight of the body
rests The strength of the muscles which act on the heel will be
increased only by about onethird
We have already seen that a double engine made up of the
gastrocnemius and soleus is the power which is applied to the heel
when we walk and that the pad of the foot lying across the sole in
line with the ball of the great toe serves as a fulcrum or rest The
weight of the body falls on the foot between the fulcrum in front and
the power behind as in a lever of the second order We have explained
why the power of the muscles of the calf is increased the more the
weight of the body is shifted towards the toes but it is also evident
that the speed and the extent to which the body is lifted are
diminished If however the weight be shifted more towards the heel
the muscles of the calf although losing in power can lift their load
more quickly and to a greater extent
We must look closely at the foot lever if we are to understand it It is
arched or bent the front pillar of the arch stretches from the summit
or keystone where the weight of the body is poised to the pad of the
foot or fulcrum Fig 6 the posterior pillar projecting as the heel
extends from the summit to the point at which the muscular power is
applied A foot with a short anterior pillar and a long posterior pillar
or heel is one designed for power not speed It is one which will serve
a hillclimber well or a heavy corpulent man The opposite kind one
with a short heel and a long pillar in front is well adapted for
running and sprintingfor speed Now we do find among the various
races of mankind that some have been given long heels such as the
darkskinned natives of Africa and of Australia while other races have
been given relatively short stumpy heels of which sort the natives of
Europe and of China may be cited as examples With long heels less
powerful muscular engines are required and hence in dark races the calf
of the leg is but ill developed because the muscles which move the heel
are small We must admit however that the gait of darkskinned races
is usually easy and graceful We Europeans on the other hand having
short heels need more powerful muscles to move them and hence our
calves are usually well developed but our gait is apt to be jerky
Illustration Fig 6The bones forming the arch of the foot seen
from the inner side
If we had the power to make our heels longer or shorter at will we
should be able as is the case in a motor cycle to alter our
speedgear according to the needs of the road With a steep hill in
front of us we should adopt a long slow powerful heel while going
down an incline a short one would best suit our needs With its
fourchange speedgear a motor cycle seems better adapted for easy and
economical travelling than the human machine If however the human
machine has no change of gear it has one very marvellous
mechanismwhich we may call a compensatory mechanism for want of a
short easy name The more we walk the more we go hillclimbing the
more powerful do the muscular engines of the heel become It is quite
different with the engine of a motor cycle the more it is used the
more does it become worn out It is because a muscular engine is living
that it can respond to work by growing stronger and quicker
I have no wish to extol the human machine unduly nor to run down the
motor cycle because of certain defects There is one defect however
which is inherent in all motor machines which man has invented but from
which the human machine is almost completely free We can illustrate the
defect best by comparing the movements of the heel with those of the
crankpin of an engine One serves as the lever by which the
gastrocnemius helps to propel the body the other serves the same
purpose in the propulsion of a motor cycle On referring to Fig 7 A
the reader will see that the pistonrod and the crankpin are in a
straight line in such a position the engine is powerless to move the
crankpin until the flywheel is started thus setting the crankpin in
motion Once started the leverage increases until the crankpin stands
at right angles to the pistonroda point of maximum power which is
reached when the piston is in the position shown in Fig 7 B Then the
leverage decreases until the second dead centre is reached Fig 7 C
from that point the leverage is increased until the second maximum is
reached Fig 7 D whereafter it decreases until the arrival at the
first position completes the cycle Thus in each revolution there are
two points where all leverage or power is lost points which are
surmounted because of the momentum given by the flywheel Clearly we
should get most out of an engine if it could be kept working near the
points of maximum leveragewith the lever as nearly as possible at
right angles to the crankpin
Illustration Fig 7Showing the crankpin of an engine at A First
dead centre B First maximum leverage C Second dead centre D Second
maximum leverage
Now we have seen that the tendon of Achilles is the piston cord and
the heel the crankpin of the muscular engine represented by the
gastrocnemius and soleus In the standing posture the heel slopes
downwards and backwards and is thus in a position as regards its
piston cord considerably beyond the point of maximum leverage As the
heel is lifted by the muscles it gradually becomes horizontal and at
right angles to its tendon or piston cord As the heel rises then it
becomes a more effective lever the muscles gain in power The more the
foot is arched the more obliquely is the heel set and the greater is
the strength needed to start it moving Hence races like the European
and Mongolian which have short as well as steeply set heels need large
calf muscles It is at the end of the upward stroke that the heel
becomes most effective as a lever and it is just then that we most need
power to propel our bodies in a forward direction It will be noted that
the heel unlike the crankpin of an engine never reaches never even
approaches that point of powerlessness known to engineers as a dead
centre Work is always performed within the limits of the most effective
working radius of the lever It is a law for all the levers of the body
they are set and moved in such a way as to avoid the occurrence of dead
centres Think what our condition would have been were this not so why
we should require revolving flywheels set in all our joints
Illustration Fig 8The arch of the foot from the inner side
showing some of the muscles which maintain it
Another property is essential in a lever it must be rigid otherwise it
will bend and power will be lost Now if the foot were a rigid lever
there would be missing two of its most useful qualities It could no
longer act as a spring or buffer to the body nor could it adapt its
sole to the various kinds of surfaces on which we have to tread or
stand Nature with her usual ingenuity has succeeded in combining
those opposing qualitiesrigidity suppleness and elasticity or
springinessby resorting to her favorite device the use of muscular
engines The arch is necessarily constructed of a number of bones which
can move on each other to a certain extent so that the foot may adapt
itself to all kinds of roads and paths It is true that the bones of the
arch are loosely bound together by passive ties or ligaments but as
these cannot be lengthened or shortened at will Nature had to fall back
on the use of muscular engines for the maintenance of the foot as an
arched lever Some of these are shown in Fig 8 The foot then is a
lever of a very remarkable kind all the time we stand or walk its
rigidity its power to serve as a lever has to be maintained by an
elaborate battery of muscular engines all kept constantly at work No
wonder our feet and legs become tired when we have to stand a great
deal Some of these engines the larger ones are kept in the leg but
their tendons or piston cords descend below the anklejoint to be fixed
to various parts of the arch and thus help to keep it up Fig 8
Within the sole of the foot has been placed an installation of seventeen
small engines all of them springing into action when we stand up thus
helping to maintain the foot as a rigid yet flexible lever
We have already seen why our muscles are so easily exhausted when we
stand stockstill they then get no rest at all Now it sometimes
happens in people who have to stand for long periods at a stretch that
these muscular engines which maintain the arch are overtaxed the arch
of the foot gives way The foot becomes flat and flexible and can no
longer serve as a lever Many men and women thus become permanently
crippled they cannot step off their toes but must shuffle along on the
inner sides of their feet But if the case of the overworked muscles
which maintain the arch is hard in grownup people it is even harder in
boys and girls who have to stand quite still for a long time or who
have to carry such burdens as are beyond their strength When we are
young the bony levers and muscular engines of our feet have not only
their daily work to do but they have continually to effect those
wonderful alterations which we call growth Hence the muscular engines
of young people need special care they must be given plenty of work to
do but that kind of active action which gives them alternate strokes of
work and rest Even the engine of a motor cycle has three strokes of
play for one of work Our engines too must have a liberal supply of
the right kind of fuel But even with all those precautions we have to
confess that the muscular engines of the foot do sometimes break down
and the leverage of the foot becomes threatened Nor have we succeeded
in finding out why they are so liable to break down in some boys and
girls and not in others Some day we shall discover this too
We are now to look at another part of the human machine so that we may
study a lever of the third order The lever formed by the forearm and
hand will suit our purpose very well It is pivoted or jointed at the
elbow the elbow is its fulcrum Fig 9 B At the opposite end of the
lever in the upturned palm of the hand we shall place a weight of 1
lb to represent the load to be moved The power which we are to yoke to
the lever is a strong muscular engine we have not mentioned before
called the brachialis anticus or front brachial muscle It lies in
the upper arm where it is fixed to the bone of that partthe humerus
It is attached to one of the bones of the forearmthe ulnajust beyond
the elbow
In the second order of lever we have seen that the muscle worked on one
end while the weight rested on the lever somewhere between the muscular
attachment and the fulcrum In levers of the third order the load is
placed at the end of the lever and the muscle is attached somewhere
between the load and the fulcrum Fig 9 A In the example we are
considering the brachial muscle is attached about half an inch beyond
the fulcrum at the elbow while the total length of the lever measured
from the elbow to the palm is 12 inches Now it is very evident that
the muscle or power being attached so close to the elbow works under a
great disadvantage as regards strength It could lift a 24lb weight
placed on the forearm directly over its attachment as easily as a single
pound weight placed on the palm But then there is this advantage the
1lb weight placed in the hand moves with twentyfour times the speed
of the 24lb weight situated near the elbow What is lost in strength
is gained in speed Whenever Nature wishes to move a light load quickly
she employs levers of the third order
Illustration Fig 9AA chisel used as a lever of the third order W
weight P power F fulcrum
We have often to move our forearm very quickly sometimes to save our
lives The difference of onehundredth of a second may mean life or
death to us on the face of a cliff when we clutch at a branch or jutting
rock to save a fall The quickness of a blow we give or fend depends on
the length of our reach A long forearm and hand are ill adapted for
lifting heavy burdens strength is sacrificed if they are too long
Hence we find that the laboring peoples of the worldEuropeans and
Mongolianshave usually short forearms and hands while the peoples who
live on such bounties as Nature may provide for them have relatively
long forearms and hands
Illustration Fig 9BThe forearm and hand as a lever of the third
order
Now man differs from anthropoid apes which are distant cousins of his
in having a forearm which is considerably shorter than the upper arm
whereas in anthropoid apes the forearm is much the longer That fact
surprises us at first especially when we remember that anthropoids
spend most of their lives amongst trees and use their arms much more
than their legs in swinging the weight of their heavy bodies from branch
to branch and from tree to tree A long forearm and hand give them a
long and quick reach so that they can seize distant branches and swing
themselves along safely and at a good pace Our first thought is to
suppose that a long forearm being a weak lever will be ill adapted
for climbing But when you look at Fig 10 the explanation becomes
plain When a branch is seized by the hand and the whole weight of the
body is supported from it the entire machinery of the arm changes its
action The forearm is no longer the lever which the brachial muscle
moves Fig 10 but now becomes the base from which it acts The part
which was its piston cord now serves as its base of fixation and what
