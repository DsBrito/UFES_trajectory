CHAPTER I
THE LAST EVENING AT HOME
Now then everyone join in the chorus commanded Hippy Wingate There
was an answering tinkle from Reddys mandolin the deeper notes of a
guitar sounded then eight carefree young voices were raised in the
plaintive chorus of My Old Kentucky Home
It was a warm night in September Miriam Nesbit and seven of the Eight
Originals were spending a last evening together on the Harlowes
hospitable veranda They were on the eve of separation The following
day would witness Noras and Jessicas departure for the conservatory
Grace and Miriam would return to Overton at the beginning of the next
week and the latter part of the same week would find the four young men
entered upon their senior year in college
Very fine indeed commented Hippy but in order to sing properly one
ought to drink a great deal of lemonade It is very conducive to a grand
opera voice he added confiscating several cakes from the plate Grace
passed to him and holding out his empty lemonade glass
But you havent a grand opera voice protested David That is only a
flimsy excuse
We wont discuss the matter in detail returned Hippy with dignity I
am prepared to prove the truth of what I say I will now render a
selection from Il Trovatore I will sing the imprisoned lovers
song
Not if I have anything to say about it growled Reddy
Suit yourself suit yourself declared Hippy shrugging his shoulders
You boys will be sorry if you dont let me sing though
Is that a threat inquired Tom Gray with pretended belligerence
A threat repeated Hippy No it is a fact I am contemplating a
terrible revenge That is I havent really begun to contemplate it yet
I am just getting ready But when I do startwell youll see
I think it would be delightful to hear you sing Ah I Have Sighed to
Rest Me Hippy broke in Nora sweetly a mischievous twinkle in her
eyes
Can I believe my ears The stony unsympathetic Nora OMalley agrees
with me at last She likes my voice she wishes to hear me sing Ah I
Have Sighed to Rest Me Tis true I have sighed to rest me a great
many times particularly in the morning when the alarm clock put an end
to my dreams It is a beautiful selection
Then why not sing it asked Nora demurely
Because I dont know it replied Hippy promptly
Just as I suspected commented Nora in disgust That is precisely why
I asked you to sing
What made you suspect me inquired Hippy apparently impressed
I suspected you on general principles was the retort
If you had had any general principles you wouldnt have suspected me
parried Hippy
I wont even think about you the next time was the withering reply
Nora rose and made her way to the other end of the veranda perching on
the porch railing beside Tom Gray
Come back Nora wailed Hippy You may suspect me
Isnt he too ridiculous for anything whispered Nora smothering a
giggle and trying to look severe Her attempt failed ignominiously when
Hippy with an exaggeratedly contrite expression on his fat face sidled
up to her salaamed profoundly lost his balance and sprawled on all
fours at her feet A shout of merriment arose from his friends Hippy
unabashed scrambled to his feet and began bowing again before Nora
this time taking care not to bend too far forward
You are forgiven Hippy declared Miriam Nora dont allow your old
friend and playmate to dislocate his spine in his efforts to show his
sorrow
You may stop bowing said Nora grudgingly I suppose Ill have to
forgive you
Hippy promptly straightened up and perched himself on the railing beside
Nora
I didnt say you might sit here teased Nora
I know it replied Hippy coolly Still you would be deeply bitterly
disappointed if I didnt
Perhaps I should admitted Nora I suppose you might as well stay
she added with affected carelessness
Thank you retorted Hippy But I had made up my mind not to move
Had you said Nora indifferently turning her back on Hippy and
addressing Tom Gray Whereupon Hippy raised his voice in a loud
monologue that entirely drowned Toms and Noras voices
For goodness sake say something that will please him Nora begged
Tom This is awful
Hippy babbled on apparently oblivious of everyone
I have something very important to tell you Hippy interposed Nora
slyly
Hippy stopped talking What is it he asked suspiciously
Come over to the other end of the veranda and find out said Nora
enigmatically
Hippy accepted the invitation promptly and followed Nora to the end of
the veranda unmindful of Tom Grays jeers about idle curiosity
Those who read Grace Harlowes Plebe Year at High School
Grace Harlowes Sophomore Year at High School Grace
Harlowes Junior Year at High School and Grace Harlowes
Senior Year at High School will have no trouble in recognizing
every member of the merry party of young folks who had taken possession
of the Harlowes veranda The doings of Tom Hippy David Reddy Nora
Jessica Anne and Grace have been fully narrated in the High School
Girls Series There too appeared Miriam Nesbit Eva Allen
Eleanor Savelli and Marian Barber together with the four chums as
members of the famous sorority the Phi Sigma Tau
With the close of their high school days the little clan had been
separated although David Reddy and Hippy were on the eve of beginning
their senior year in the same college Nora and Jessica were attending
the same conservatory while Grace Anne and Miriam Nesbit were students
at Overton College
During their freshman year at Overton set forth in Grace Harlowes
First Year at Overton College the three girls had not met with
altogether plain sailing There had been numerous hitches the most
serious one having been caused by their championship of J Elfreda
Briggs a freshman who had unfortunately incurred the dislike of
several mischievous sophomores Through the prompt sensible action of
Grace assisted by her friends Elfreda was restored to favor by her
class and became one of Graces staunchest friends
Grace Harlowes Second Year at Overton College found the
three friends sophomores and wholly devoted to Overton and its
traditions Their sophomore days brought them a variety of experiences
pleasant and unpleasant and as in their freshman year Grace and
Miriam distinguished themselves on the basketball field It was during
this year that the Semper Fidelis Club was organized for the purpose of
helping needy students through college and that Eleanor Savelli the
daughter of a worldrenowned virtuoso and one of the Phi Sigma Tau
visited Grace and helped to plan a concert which netted the club two
hundred dollars and a substantial yearly subscription from an interested
outsider The difficulties that arose over a lost theme and the final
outcome of the affair proved Grace Harlowe to be the same honorable
straightforward young woman who had endeared herself to the reader
during her high school days
Why doesnt some one sing asked Grace plaintively A brief silence
had fallen upon the little group at one end of the veranda broken only
by Noras and Hippys argumentative voices
Because both the someones are too busy to sing laughed Jessica
casting a significant glance toward the end of the veranda
Hippy Nora called David come over here and sing
Sing sing what shall I sing chanted Hippy Shall it be a sweetly
sentimental ditty or shall I sing of brooks and meadows fields and
flowers
Sing that funny one you sang for the fellows the night of the Pi
Ipsilon dinner urged David
Very well beamed Hippy Remember to the singer belongs the food I
always negotiate for refreshments before lifting up my voice in song
I will see that you are taken care of Hippy smiled Mrs Harlowe who
had come out on the veranda in time to hear Hippys declaration
Hello Mother dear called Grace I didnt know you were there
The young people were on their feet in an instant Grace led her mother
to a chair Stay with us awhile Mother she said Hippy is going to
sing and Nora too
Then I shall surely stay replied Mrs Harlowe And after the songs
you must come into the house and be my guests The table is set for
seven
How nice in you Mother exclaimed Grace kissing her mothers cheek
You are always doing the things that make people happy Nora and Hippy
please sing your very best for Mother You first Hippy because I want
Nora to sing Tostis Serenata and a comic song afterward will
completely spoil the effect
Hippy sang two songs in his own inimitable fashion Then Noras sweet
high soprano voice began the Serenata to the subdued tinkling
accompaniment of Reddys mandolin Two years in the conservatory had
done much for Noras voice though its plaintive sweetness had been her
natural heritage As they listened to the clear rounded tones with
just a suspicion of sadness in them the little company realized to a
person that Noras hopes of becoming known in the concert or grand opera
world were quite likely to be fulfilled
How I wish Anne were here tonight lamented Grace after having
vigorously applauded Noras song She loves to hear you sing Nora
I know it sighed Nora Dear little Anne Im so sorry we cant see
her before we go back to the conservatory While we have been sitting
here singing and enjoying ourselves Anne has been appearing in her
farewell performance I am glad we had a chance to visit her this
summer even though we had to cross the state to do it
She will be here tomorrow night but we shall be at the end of our
journey by that time lamented Jessica I wish we might stay and see
her but we cant
Never mind you will meet her at Christmas time when the Eight
Originals gather home comforted Miriam
But wed like to see her now interposed David mournfully What is
Oakdale without Anne
At that moment Mrs Harlowe who after Noras song had excused herself
and gone into the house appeared in the door
Come children she smiled the feast is spread
May I escort you to the table asked David gravely offering her his
arm Heading the little procession they led the way to the dining room
followed by Reddy and Jessica Hippy and Nora Grace Tom and Miriam
There for the next hour goodfellowship reigned supreme and when at last
the various members of the little clan departed for home each one
carried in his or her heart the conviction that Life could never offer
anything more desirable than these happy evenings which they had spent
together
I cant tell you how much I missed Anne tonight said Grace to her
mother as arm in arm they stood on the veranda watching their guests
until they had turned the corner of the next street
We all missed her replied her mother but I believe David felt her
absence even more keenly than we did He is very fond of Anne I wonder
if she realizes that he really loves her and that he will some day tell
her so She is such a quiet selfcontained little girl Her emotions
are all kept for her work
I believe she does said Grace She has never spoken of it to me
David has been her faithful knight ever since her freshman year at high
school so she ought to have a faint inkling of what the rest of us
know I am sorry for David Annes art is a powerful rival and she is
growing fonder of it with every season If after she finishes college
she were to marry David she would be obliged to give it up Since the
Southards came into her life she has grown to love her profession so
dearly that I dont imagine she would sacrifice it even for Davids
sake
It sounds rather strange to hear my little girl talking so wisely of
other peoples love affairs smiled Mrs Harlowe almost wistfully
I know what you are thinking Motherkin responded Grace slipping
both arms about her mother and drawing her gently into the big porch
swing You neednt be afraid though I dont feel in the least
sentimental over any one not even Tom Gray and I like him better than
any other young man I know I am far more concerned over what to do once
I have finished college I simply must work but I havent yet found my
vocation Neither has Miriam Jessica thinks she has found hers but she
found Reddy first and he does not intend that she shall lose sight of
him Hippy and Nora are a great deal fonder of each other than appears
on the surface too Their disagreements are never private Nora said
the other day that she and Hippy had had only one quarrel andthis is
the funniest bit of news you ever heard Motherit was because Hippy
became jealous of a violinist Nora knows at the conservatory Imagine
Hippy as being jealous
Grace talked on to her mother of her friends and of herself while Mrs
Harlowe listened thinking happily that she was doubly blessed in not
only her daughter but in having that daughters confidence as well
CHAPTER II
THE ARRIVAL OF KATHLEEN
There is a whole lot in getting accustomed to things remarked J
Elfreda Briggs sagely as she stood with a hammer and nail in one hand
a Japanese print in the other her round eyes scanning the wall for an
appropriate place to hang her treasure
Its a beauty isnt it declared Miriam passing over her roommates
remark and looking admiringly at the print which her roommate had just
taken from her trunk
What this asked Elfreda Youd better believe it is Goodness knows
I paid enough for it But I wasnt talking about this print I was
talking about our present junior estate What I wonder is whether being
a junior will go to my head and make me vainglorious or whether I shall
wear the honor as a graceful crown ended the stout girl with an
affected smile which changed immediately to a derisive grin
I should say neither responded Miriam slyly I dont believe
anything would ever go to your head Youre too matteroffact and as
for your graceful crown it would be over one ear within half an hour
Both girls laughed then Elfreda having found a spot on the wall that
met with her approval set the nail and began hammering There she
exclaimed with satisfaction That is exactly where I want it Now I can
begin to think about something else
I wonder why Grace and Anne havent paid us a call this morning mused
Miriam who sat listlessly before her trunk apparently undecided
whether to begin the tedious labor of unpacking or to put it off until
some more convenient day
Ill go and find them volunteered Elfreda dropping her hammer and
turning toward the door They must be at home Five minutes later she
raced back with the news that their door was locked and the out
indefinitely sign was displayed
That is very strange pondered Miriam aloud I wonder where they
have gone
Why on earth didnt they tell us they were going Thats what Id like
to know declared Elfreda
Perhaps Mrs Elwood knows something about it suggested Miriam
The mere mention of Mrs Elwoods name caused Elfreda to dart through
the hall and downstairs to the livingroom in search of the goodnatured
matron Failing to find her she walked through the kitchen to the shady
back porch where Mrs Elwood sat rocking and reading the newspaper
which the newsboy had just brought
Oh Mrs Elwood she cried have you seen Grace and Anne We cant
find them
Didnt Miss Dean tell you asked Mrs Elwood in a surprised tone
Miss Dean repeated Elfreda disgustedly No wonder we didnt know
what had become of them With all Emmas estimable qualities she is the
one person I know whom I would not trust to deliver a message I beg
your pardon Mrs Elwood I didnt mean that you were in any sense to
blame We ought to have warned you only Emma is such a splendid girl
that one hates to mention a silly little thing like that Just forget
that I said it will you
Mrs Elwood smiled I quite understand Miss Briggs she said gravely
The message Miss Harlowe left with me was this If the girls ask where
we have gone tell them that we received a telegram and had to go to the
station All explanations when we come back
That settles it groaned Elfreda We know only enough to whet our
curiosity And we cant find out more unless we follow them to the
station We cant do that either It would not look well Besides we
are not invited Elfreda had been rapidly reflecting aloud much to
Mrs Elwoods amusement Ill have to go back and tell Miriam she
finished
But why did they lock their door asked Miriam when Elfreda had
repeated her information
I dont know returned Elfreda thoughtfully Yes I do know she
exclaimed with sudden inspiration I think Grace was afraid she might
have a repetition of last years performance
Last years performance repeated Miriam in a puzzled tone
Yes dont you remember the Anarchist retorted Elfreda with a
reminiscent grin
Of course exclaimed Miriam laughing a little at the recollection
Wasnt she formidable though when she slammed the door in our faces
Elfreda nodded She is all right now At least she was when she visited
me I never saw a girl blossom and expand as she did Pa liked her He
thought she was smart She is too She has lived so entirely with that
scientific father of hers that she has absorbed all sorts of odds and
ends of knowledge from him That is why college and girls and the whole
thing terrified her
Terrified her said Miriam incredulously I thought matters quite the
reverse
That was precisely what I thought until she told me that no matter how
vengeful she looked she was always afraid of the girls She never
seemed to be able to say the right thing at the right moment That was
why she used to scowl so fiercely when any one spoke or looked at her
I dont think it was altogether fear of the girls that caused her to
lock us out that day observed Miriam a gleam of laughter appearing in
her black eyes
I dont suppose it was retorted Elfreda goodhumoredly She says she
knows her disposition to be anything but angelic But she is trying
Miriam You wait and see for yourself how the new Laura Atkins behaves
But to go back to the subject of the door what makes you think Grace
locked it on account of last year persisted Miriam
Oh I dont know answered Elfreda vaguely I just thought so thats
all
Well ask her when she comes just for fun declared Miriam Why not
go downstairs and sit on the back veranda with Mrs Elwood We can hear
the girls as soon as they come into the yard
All right agreed Elfreda Do you care if I take my magazine along I
am not quite through with an article I began this morning
I object seriously smiled Miriam I shall expect you to entertain
me You can finish reading your article later
Elfreda glanced up quickly from the magazine she held in her hand Then
catching sight of her friends smiling face she tucked her magazine
under one arm linked her free arm through Miriams and marched her
toward the stairs They had reached the foot of the stairs and were half
way down the hall when the sound of voices caused both girls to stand
still listening intently
That sounds like Graces voice exclaimed Elfreda With one accord
they turned about hurrying to the veranda at the front of the house in
time to see Grace and Anne approaching Both girls were laden with
luggage while between them walked an alert little figure tugging a bag
of golf sticks a fat black leather hand bag and a camera
What manner of woman have we here muttered Elfreda regarding the
newcomer with quizzical eyes
But before Miriam found time to reply the newcomer set her luggage in
the middle of the walk and running up to Miriam and Elfreda said with
a frank laugh This is Miriam and this is Elfreda You see I know both
of you from Mabels description
Whowhat began Elfreda
Girls said Grace who had by this time come up with the animated
stranger this is Miss West a friend of Mabel Ashes My telegram was
from Mabel asking me to meet Miss West and as Anne and I were on the
porch when it came and the train we were to meet was due we didnt
stop for explanations or hats but raced down the street as fast as we
could go
While Grace was talking Kathleen West was shaking hands vigorously with
Miriam and Elfreda Im so glad to know you she said and I think
Im going to like you Im not so sure about liking college even though
Ive worked so hard to get here I hope to goodness I dont flunk in the
exams
I am sure that any friend of Mabels is bound to be ours also said
Miriam courteously She had not made up her mind regarding the newcomer
Thank you From what she said I should imagine that you and she were on
very good terms returned the stranger lightly Of course you know who
I am and all about me
Grace smiled Not yet but we are willing to hear anything you wish to
tell us
Oh thats so exclaimed the stranger Mabel wrote about me but her
letter hasnt reached you yet and of course telegrams cant be very
lengthy unless you wish to spend a fortune or the office has a
franchise There I go again about the office I might as well tell the
truth and have done with it Im a newspaper woman
CHAPTER III
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Miriam smiled involuntarily Grace looked surprised Elfreda
indifferent and Anne amused The word woman seemed absurdly out of
place from the lips of this girl who looked as though she had just been
promoted to long dresses
Oh yes I know I look not more than eighteen quickly remarked
Kathleen West noticing Miriams smile But Im not Im twentytwo
years old and Ive been on a newspaper for four years Why thats the
way I earned my money to come here Ill tell you about it some other
time Its too long a story for now Besides Im hungry At what time
are we to be fed and are the meals good I have no illusions regarding
boarding houses
The meals are excellent replied Anne You must have dinner with us
Then we will see about securing a room for you I think you will be able
to get in here This used to be considered a freshman house but all
those who were freshmen with us have stayed on and if last years
freshmen stay too then Wayne Hall will be full and
I wont get in finished the young woman calmly
Come into the house now and meet Mrs Elwood invited Grace Then you
can learn your fate
Yes I can just make room for you Mrs Elwood was saying a few
minutes later Miss Evans is not coming back and Miss Acker is going
to Livingstone Hall Her two particular friends are there Miss Dean
wishes to room alone this year so that disposes of the vacancy left by
Miss Acker But the half of the room Miss Evans had is not occupied It
is on the second floor at the east end of the hall
Then Ill take it returned Kathleen promptly and move in at once I
may not stay here long but at least Ill be happy while I stay But if
I should survive all these exams there will be cause for rejoicing and
Ill give a frolic that you will all remember or my names not Kathleen
West Is there any one who would love to help me upstairs with my
things
Well what do you think of her asked Elfreda abruptly Having helped
Kathleen to her room with her luggage they had left her to herself and
were now in their own room Miriam stood looking out the window her
hands behind her back At Elfredas question she turned looked
thoughtfully at her roommate then said slowly I dont know I havent
decided Shes friendly and enthusiastic and hard and indifferent all in
the same moment I think her work has made her so I believe she has
hidden her inner self away so deep that she has forgotten what the real
Kathleen is like
I believe so too Miriam agreed Elfreda I could see that you
werent favorably impressed with her I could see
You see entirely too much laughed Miriam I havent even formed an
opinion of Miss West yet I wonder how long she has known Mabel Ashe
Not very long Ill wager
An hour later Grace appeared in the door waving a letter Heres
Mabels letter she cried Come into my room and we will read it
The letter was not far behind the telegram remarked Anne as she
closed the door of their room and seated herself on the couch beside
Miriam
Do hurry Grace and read us what Mabel has to offer on the subject of
Kathleen MavourneenWest I mean corrected Elfreda with a giggle
Grace unfolded the letter and began to read
MY DEAR GRACE
Please forgive me for neglecting you so shamefully but I am now
wrestling with a real job on a real newspaper and am so occupied
with trying to keep it that I havent had time to think of anything
else Father is deeply disgusted with my journalistic efforts He
wished me to go to Europe this summer but the light of ambition
burns too vividly to be quenched even by my beloved Europe When
next I go abroad it will be with my own hardearned wages
I havent done anything startling yet I have been chronicling
faithfully the doings of society As most of the elect are out of
town my news gathering has not been in the nature of a harvest
However I am still striving still hoping for the day when I shall
leave society far behind and sally forth on the trail of a big
story
But I am diverging from one of the chief purposes of this letter
It is to introduce to you Kathleen West an ambitious and
particularly clever young woman who is a star reporter on this
paper It seems that she and I have changed ambitions I sigh for
journalistic fame and she sighs for college She has done more
than sigh She has been saving her money for ever so long
determined to take unto herself a college education I admire her
spirit and have praised Overton so warmlyhow could I help
itthat she has decided to cast her lot there Hence my telegram
also this letter Please be as nice with her as you know how to be
for I am sure she will prove herself a credit to Overton
I shall hope to see you some time during the fall I am going to
try to get a day or two off and run down to see you Tell Anne the
Press is greater than the Stage and tell Elfreda and Miriam that I
am collecting the autographs of famous people and that theirs would
be greatly appreciated particularly if attached to letters I must
bring this epistle to an abrupt close and go out on the trail of
an engagement the rumor of which was whispered to me last night
With love to you and the girls
MABEL
P S Frances sails for home next week
What a nice letter commented Elfreda It is just like her isnt
it
Yes replied Grace slowly Girls do you suppose Mabel and Miss West
are really friends
Not as we are replied Miriam with a positive shake of her head
Elfreda and I were talking of that very thing while you were in your
room Elfreda said she didnt believe that Mabel had known Miss West
long
What is the matter with us asked Grace a trifle impatiently Here
we are prowling about the bush trying to conceal under polite inquiry
the fact that we dont quite approve of Miss West We would actually
like to dig up something to criticize
There is nothing like absolute freedom of speech is there said
Elfreda with a short laugh
It is true though said Grace stoutly It isnt fair either She
has done nothing to deserve it Besides Mabel likes her
Mabel doesnt say in her letter that she likes her reminded Anne
She says Miss West is clever and that she admires her spirit
You too Anne said Grace reproachfully
I dont like her declared Elfreda belligerently If it werent for
Mabels letter Id leave her strictly to her own devices
We ought to be ashamed of ourselves exclaimed Grace We have met
Miss West with smiles and here we are discussing her behind her back
I didnt meet her with smiles contradicted Elfreda I was as sober
as a judge all the time we stood talking to her She is too flippant to
suit me She doesnt take college very seriously I could see that
There goes the dinner bell exclaimed Grace with sudden irrelevance
to the subject of the newspaper girl Let us stop gossiping and go to
dinner
At dinner Grace was not sorry to note that Kathleen West had been placed
at the end of the table farthest from her Through the meal she found
her eyes straying often toward the erect little figure of the newcomer
who exhibiting not a particle of reserve chatted with the girls
nearest to her with the utmost unconcern I suppose her newspaper
training has made her selfpossessed and not afraid of strangers
reflected Grace But she could not refrain from secretly wondering a
little just how strong a friendship existed between Kathleen West and
Mabel
CHAPTER IV
GETTING ACQUAINTED WITH THE NEWSPAPER GIRL
It was just this way began Kathleen West setting down her tea cup
and looking impressively from one girl to the other Long before I
graduated from high school I had made up my mind to go to college Now
