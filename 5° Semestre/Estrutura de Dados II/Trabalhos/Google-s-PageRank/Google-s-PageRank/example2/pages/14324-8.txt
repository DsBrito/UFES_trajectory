Illustration FOREST OF COCKATOOS
People who go to Australia expecting every other man they meet to be a
convict and every convict a ruffian in felons garb will assuredly
find themselves mistaken And if contemplating a residence in Sydney or
Melbourne they need not anticipate the necessity of living in a tent or
a shanty nor yet of accepting the society of convicts or negroes as the
only alternative to a life of solitude Neither will it be necessary to
go armed with revolvers by day nor to place plate and jewels under
guard at night Sydney the capital of the penal colony is a quiet
orderly city abounding in villas and gardens churches and schools and
about its welllighted streets ride and walk welldressed and wellbred
people whose visages betray neither the ruffian nor the cannibal Some
of them may be convicts or ticketofleavemen but this a stranger
would need to be told as they dress like others their equipages are
quite as stylish and many of them not only amass more property but are
really more honest than some of those never sentenced because they
know that the continuance of their freedom depends on their reputation
Illustration SYDNEY
The city built on the south side of a beautiful lake is perfectly
unique in design being composed of five broad promontories looking
like the five fingers of a hand slightly expanded All the important
streets run from east to west and each terminates in a distinct harbor
while clearly visible from the upper portion of the street is a grand
moving panorama of vessels of every description with masts sails and
colors that seem peering out from every interstice between the houses
Each day witnesses the arrival and departure of eight or ten steamers
ferryboats leave every half hour all the principal landings for the
various sections of the city and the wharves are lined with the
shipping of every nation many of the vessels ranging from fifteen
hundred to two thousand tons burden On a huge rock in Watsons Bay
stands the lighthouse at the entrance of Port Jackson The sea lashes
the black rock with ceaseless fury the light from the summit rendering
even the base visible at a great distance The light is 350 feet above
the level of the sea yet it was almost under its very rays that the
good ship Dunbar came to grief Missing the passage she was engulfed in
the raging sea and her three hundred and ninety passengers perished in
full view of the homes they were seeking
Orange and almond trees with other tropical plants loaded with
blossoms and fruit beautify the lowlands while in more elevated
localities are found the fruits and foliage of the temperate zone very
many of them exotics brought by the settlers from their English homes
Down to the very waters edge extends the verdure of tree and shrub
overshadowing to the right Fort Jackson and to the left Middle Harbor
The Government House commands the bay with the imposing mien of a
fortress and the magnificent receptionrooms are worthy of a
sovereigns court The garden surrounding it occupies a beautiful
promontory its borders washed by the sea the walks shaded by trees
imported from Europe and the whole parterre redolent with tropical
beauty and fragrance On the promenades are frequently assembled at
evening two or three hundred ladies and gentlemen in full dress while
military bands discourse sweet music for the entertainment of the
brilliant throng
Ballarat may be called the city of gold Melbourne of clubs democracy
and thriving commerce Hobart Town takes the premium for hospitality and
picturesque beauty but Sydney bears the impress of genuine English
aristocracy in combination with a sort of Creole piquancy singularly in
contrast with English exclusiveness yet giving a wonderful charm to the
society of this city of high life so full of gayety brilliancy and
luxury Who would recognize in the Sydney of today with its four
hundred thousand inhabitants its churches theatres and libraries the
outgrowth of the penal colony of Botany Bay planted only eightyseven
years ago on savage shores It was in May 1787 that the first colony
left England for Botany Bay a squadron of eleven vessels carrying
eleven hundred and eighteen colonists to make a lodgment on an unknown
shore inhabited by savages Of these eleven hundred and eighteen there
were six hundred male and two hundred and fifty female convicts the
remaining portion being composed of officers and soldiers to take charge
of the new penal settlement under the command of Governor Phillip From
so unpromising a beginning has grown the present rich and flourishing
settlement and in lieu of the few temporary shanties erected by the
first colonists there stands a magnificent city of more than ordinarily
fine architecture with banks and hospitals schools and churchesamong
the latter a superb cathedralall displaying the proverbial prodigality
of labor and expense for which the English are noted in the erection and
adornment of their public edifices Among the educational establishments
are the English University with a public hall like that of Westminster
St Johns College Catholic and national primary and high schools
where are educated about thirtyfour thousand pupils at an annual
expense to the government of more than three hundred thousand dollars
From the parent colony have sprung others while the poverty and
corruption that were the distinguishing features of the original element
have been gradually lost in the more recent importations of honest and
respectable citizens
Apart from the wealth and gayety of Sydney there is much in its various
grades of society to interest the average tourist The ticketofleave
menthat is convicts who having served out a portion of their term
and been favorably reported for good conduct are permitted to go at
large and begin life anewform a distinct class and exert a widespread
influence by their wealth benevolence and commercial enterprise
Illustration ASTROLABE AND ZELEE ON CORAL REEFS
Very many of the better class are talented and well educated with the
manners and appearance of gentlemen and in some cases there has been
perhaps but the single crime for which they suffered expatriation
and disgrace Such as these as a rule conduct themselves with
propriety from the moment of being sentenced never murmur at their work
or discipline be it ever so hard and probably after a single year of
hardship are favorably reported and permitted to seek or make homes for
themselves Many of them own bank shares and real estate and some
become immensely rich either by ability or chance goodfortune The
property is their own but the owners are always watched by those in
power and are liable at any moment to be ordered back to their old
positions These remanded men are treated with the greatest severity
and few have sufficient power of endurance to live out even a short term
with its increase of rigor and hardship Yet to the energy and
enterprise of the liberated felons is probably due more than to any
other cause that increase of prosperity which has long since rendered
these colonies not only selfsupporting but a source of revenue to the
Crown
Illustration CANNIBAL FIRES
Another and the most dangerous class of convicts are those known as
bushrangers They are desperate fellows composed of the very lowest
scum of England have ordinarily been sentenced for life and having no
hope of pardon or desire for amendment they escape as soon as possible
often by the murder of one or more of their guards and take refuge in
the wilds of the interior Some of these bushrangers are associated
together in large hordes but others roam solitary for months before
they will venture to trust their lives in the hands of other desperadoes
like themselves There are hundreds of these lawless men prowling like
wild beasts for their prey in the vicinity of every thoroughfare between
the cities and the mines robbing and murdering defenceless passengers
plundering the mails and constantly exacting the best of their flocks
and herds from the stockmen and shepherds who in their isolated
positions dare not refuse their demands So desperate is the character
of these outlaws that they are seldom taken though thousands of pounds
are occasionally offered for the head of some noted ringleader They may
be killed in skirmishes but will not suffer themselves to be taken
alive A man calling himself Black Darnley ranged the woods for years
committing all sorts of crimes but at length met a violent death at the
hands of another convict whose daughter he had outraged
A curious memento of the first theatre opened in Sydney and the first
performance within its walls has come down to us from the year 1796
about eight years after the establishment of the penal colony It was
opened by permission of the governor all the actors were convicts who
won the privilege by good behavior and the price of admission was one
shilling payable in silver flour meat or wine The prologue written
by a cidevant pickpocket of London illustrates the character of
the times in those early days of the colony
From distant climes oer widespread seas we come
Though not with much eclat or beat of drum
True patriots all for be it understood
We left our country for our countrys good
No private views disgraced our generous zeal
What urged our travels was our countrys weal
And none will doubt but that our emigration
Has proved most useful to the British nation
But you inquire what could our breasts inflame
With this new passion for theatric fame
What in the practice of our former days
Could shape our talents to exhibit plays
Your patience sirs some observations made
Youll grant us equal to the scenic trade
He who to midnight ladders is no stranger
Youll own will make an admirable Ranger
And sure in Filch I shall be quite at home
Some truebred Falstaff we may hope to start
The scene to vary we shall try in time
To treat you with a little pantomime
Here light and easy Columbines are found
And welltried Harlequins with us abound
From durance vile our precious selves to keep
We often had recourse to the flying leap
To a black face have sometimes owed escape
And Hounslow Heath has proved the worth of crape
But how you ask can we eer hope to soar
Above these scenes and rise to tragic lore
Too oft alas weve forced the unwilling tear
And petrified the heart with real fear
Macbeth a harvest of applause will reap
For some of us I fear have murdered sleep
His lady too with grace will sleep and talk
Our females have been used at night to walk
Grant us your favor put us to the test
To gain your smiles well do our very best
And without dread of future Turnkey Lockets
Thus in an honest way still pick your pockets
It was by the coralbound Straits of Torres reckoned by navigators the
most difficult in the world that the English government determined a
few years ago to send an envoy to open communication between the
Australian colony and the Dutch possessions of Java and Sumatra The
Hero was the vessel selected for this perilous missiona voyage of
twelve hundred miles through seas studded thickly with reefs and islands
of coral many of which lay just beneath the surface of the
waveshidden pitfalls of death whose yawning jaws threatened instant
destruction to the unwary voyager The splendid steamer Cowarra had been
wrecked on these reefs only a few months before but a single one of her
two hundred and seventyfive passengers escaping a watery grave Her
tall masts still standing bolt upright amid the coralreefs presented
a gaunt spectacle plainly visible from the Heros decks as she threaded
her way among the shoaly waters while a similar though less tragical
warning was the disaster that had overtaken two other vessels the
Astrolabe and the Zelee which by a sudden ebb of the tide were thrown
high and dry upon the sands and remained in this frightful condition
for eight days before the returning waters drifted them off But the
Hero was a staunch craftan iron blockaderunner built at Glasgow
during our late war She was of twelve hundred tons burden manned by
fortytwo men and had already weathered storms and dangers enough to
earn a right to the name she bore Right nobly she fulfilled her
dangerous mission threading her way with difficulty among whole fields
of coral that sometimes almost enclosed her low hull as between two
walls again seeming upon the very verge of the breakers or ready to be
engulfed in their whirling eddies but emerging at last into the open
channel a monument of the skill and watchfulness of her officers Many
of these for days together never left the deck and the lead was cast
three or four times an hour during the whole passage of these dangerous
seas Such is the history of navigation in coral seas but if full of
danger they are equally replete with picturesque beauty In the coral
isle with its blue lagoon its circling reef and smiling vegetation
there is a wondrous fascination while in the long reefs with the ocean
driving furiously upon them only to be driven pitilessly back all
wreathed in white foam and diamond spray there is enough of the sublime
to transfix the most careless observer The barrier reef that skirts the
northeast coast of the Australian continent is the grandest coral
formation in the world stretching for a distance of a thousand miles
with a varying breadth of from two hundred yards to a mile The maximum
distance from the shore is seventy miles but it rarely exceeds
twentyfive or thirty Between this and the mainland lies a sheltered
channel safe for the most part when reached but there are few open
passages from the ocean and the shoals of imperfectlyformed coral that
lie concealed just below the surface render the most watchful care
necessary to a safe passage The fires of the cannibals visible on
every peak all along the coast shed their ruddy light over the blue
waters illumining here and there some lofty crest and adding a weird
beauty to the enchanting scene
Illustration MONUMENT TO BURKE AND WILLS
America has no monuments say our Transatlantic cousins because it
is but two hundred years old Well Australia with little more than
threequarters of a hundred has already its monumenta beautiful

and the third the finding of the remains
Illustration BASRELIEF FINDING OF BURKE
Burke and Wills to whom belongs the honor of being the first explorers
that crossed the entire continent of Australia extending their
researches from the Australian to the Pacific Ocean set out on the 20th
of August 1860 with a party of fifteen hardy pioneers upon their
perilous mission Burke was in the prime of life a man of iron frame
dauntless courage and an enthusiasm that knew neither difficulty nor
danger Wills who belonged to a family that had already given one of
its members to Sir John Franklins fatal expedition to find a martyrs
grave among the eternal icebergs of the north was somewhat younger and
perhaps less enthusiastic but was endowed with a rare discretion and
farseeing sagacity that peculiarly fitted him to be the friend and
counselor of the enthusiastic Burke in such an undertaking All
Melbourne was in excitement the government gave fifty thousand dollars
various individuals ten thousand to aid the enterprise and every heart
was aglow with aspirations for their success as the little band of
heroes waved their adieus and turned their faces outward to seek paths
hitherto untrodden by the white mans foot Besides horses twentyseven
camels had been imported from India for the express use of the explorers
and for the transportation of tents baggage equipments and fifteen
months supply of provisions with vessels for carrying such supplies of
water as the character of the country over which they were passing
should require them to take with them Their plan of march divided
itself into three stages of which Coopers Creek was the middle one
and about the centre of the Australian continent At first their
progress was slow encumbered as they were by excess of baggage and
equipments then discontents arose in the little band and Burke too
ardent and impulsive for a leader was first grieved and then angered
at what he deemed a want of spirit among some of his men On the 19th of
October at Menindie he left a portion of the troop under the command
of Lieutenant Wright with orders after a short rest to rejoin him at
Coopers Creek It was the end of January before Wright set out for the
point indicated Meanwhile as month followed month bringing to
Melbourne no news of Burkes party the worst fears were awakened
concerning its fate and an expedition was fitted out to search for the
lost heroes To young Howitt was given the command and it was his
fortune to unveil the sad mystery that had enveloped their fate On the
29th of June 1861 crossing the river Loddon Howitt encountered a
portion of Burkes company under the lead of Brahe the fourth
lieutenant Four of his men had died of scurvy and the rest of his
little band seemed utterly dispirited Howitt learned that in two months
Burke had crossed the entire route sometimes desert sometimes prairie
between Menindie and Coopers Creek and had reached the borders of the
Gulf of Carpentaria on the extreme north of the continent also that
he was there in January enduring the fiercest heat of summer and men
and beasts alike languishing for water and nearly out of provisions It
was all in vain that he deplored the tardiness of Wright and hoped as
he neared Coopers Creek for the coming of those who alone had the
means of life for his little squad of famished men Equally in vain that
Wills with three camels reconnoitred the ground for scores of miles
hoping to find water Not an oasis not a rivulet was to be found and
without a single drop of water to quench their parched lips they set out
on another long and dreary march Desiring to secure the utmost speed
Burke had left Brahe on the 16th of December with the sick and most of
his provisions at Coopers Creek to remain three months at least and
longer if they were able while he with Wills Grey and King and six
camels pushed bravely on determined not to halt till the Pacific was
reached Battling with the terrible heat sometimes for days together
without water and again obtaining a supply when they had almost
perished for want of it having occasional fierce conflicts with the
natives and more deadly encounters with poisonous serpents but with an
energy and courage that knew no such word as failure the indomitable
quartette went bravely on The wishedfor goal was reached and the
heroes jubiliant though worn and weary then returned once more to
Coopers Creek to find the post deserted by Brahe and Wright not
arrived while neither water nor provisions remained to supply their
need
Illustration VALLEY OF LAUNCESTON VAN DIEMENS LAND
All this Howitt learned after his arrival at the rendezvous where he
observed cut in the bark of a tree the word Dig and on throwing up
the earth found an iron casket deposited by Brahe giving the date of
his departure and reasons for withdrawal before the appointed time Of
far deeper interest were papers written by Burke announcing that he had
reached the Pacific coast and retraced his steps as far as Coopers
Creekthat for two months the little party had advanced rapidly making
constantly new discoveries of fertile lands widespread prairies
gushing streams and wellwatered valleys Occasionally they had found
lagoons of salt water hills of red sand trees of beautiful foliage
and mounds indicating the presence at some unknown period of the
aboriginal inhabitants They had discovered a range of high mountains in
the north and called them the Standish Mountains while at their foot
lay outspread a scene so lovely of verdant groves and fertile meadows
of wellwatered plains and heavy forest trees that they christened it
the Land of Promise Then they reached again more sterile lands parched
and dry without a rivulet or an oasis They suffered for water and food
grew scarce but sure of relief at Coopers Creek they pushed bravely
on and reached the rendezvous to learn that the men who could have
saved them had passed on but seven hours before After having
accomplished so much so bravely battled with heat and hunger serpents
and cannibals to perish at last of starvation seemed a fate too
terrible and we cannot wonder that the little band fought their destiny
to the last Little scraps of the journal of Burke and his friends tell
the sad tale of the last few weeks of agony On March 6th Burke seemed
near dying from having eaten a bit of a large serpent that he had
cooked On the 30th they killed one of their camels and on April 10th
they killed Billy Burkes favorite ridinghorse On the 11th they
were forced to halt on account of the condition of Grey who was no
longer able to proceed On the 21st they reached an oasisa little
squad of human skeletons scarcely more than alive
Illustration COURSE OF THE TAMAR VAN DIEMENS LAND
Far and wide their longing eyes gazed in search of succor they called
aloud with all their little remaining strength but the oasis was
deserted and the echo of their own sad voices was all the reply that
reached the despairing men Then at their rendezvous finding the word
Dig on the tree where Howitt found it at a later day they opened the
soil and so learned the departure of Brahe on that very morning How
terribly tantalizing after their exhausting march and still more
exhausting return after having killed and eaten all their camels but
two and all their horses after making discoveries that unlocked to the
world the vast interior of this hitherto unknown continent to find that
they were just too late to be saved Despair and death seemed staring
them in the face their long overtaxed powers of endurance failed them
utterly and the gaunt spectre of famine that had been journeying with
the brave men for weeks threatened now to enfold them in its terrible
embrace Should they yield without another struggle Burke suddenly
remembered Mount Despair a cattlestation about one hundred and fifty
leagues away and with his indomitable resolution persuaded his
companions to start for it depositing first in the little iron casket
the journal of his discoveries and the date of his departure As if to
add the last finishing stroke of agony to the sad story Burke and his
companions had hardly turned their faces westward ere Brahe and Wright
who had met at the passage of the Loddon and were now overwhelmed with
remorse at their careless neglect of their leaders orders determined
to revisit Coopers Creek and see if any tidings were to be gained of
the missing party
Illustration GORGE OF THE TAMAR VAN DIEMENS LAND
Thoughtless as imprudent they did not examine the casket but supposing
it had remained undisturbed where they left it they turned their faces
southward to the Darling utterly unsuspicious of the recent visit of
Burke and his unfortunate comrades Within two days after the trio began
their dreary march to Mount Despair both their camels fell from
exhaustion but still the poor weary travelers pressed onward
continuing their search till the 24th of May Discovering no eminence
above the horizon they then gave up in despair and began to retrace
their steps leaving on a tree the date of departure In one more days
march they would have reached the summit and been saved
On the 20th of June it was evident that young Wills could not long
survive and on the 29th are dated his last words a letter to his
father full of tenderness and resignation My death here within a few
hours is certain but my soul is calm Still almost in the last agony
he made another effort to escape his fatal destiny and set forth to
reconnoitre the ground once more if perchance succor might be found
Alone with none to close his eyes he fell asleep and Howitt after
long search found the skeleton body stretched upon the sands the
natives having compassionately covered it with boughs and leaves
Burkes last words are dated on the 28th one day earlier than those of
Wills We have gained the shores of the ocean but we have been
aband The last word is unfinished as if his pen had refused to make
the cruel record Burkes wasted remains too were found covered with
leaves and boughs By his side lay his revolver and the record of his
great exploits was in the little casket at the foot of the tree King
survived and was found by Howitt naked famished and unable to speak
or walk but after long recruiting he was able to relate the details of
suffering of those last few months unknown to all the world save
himself Howitt reverently wrapped the precious remains in the union
jack and leaving them in their lonely grave retraced his steps to
Melbourne with the precious casket of papers the last legacy of the
dead heroes On the 6th of the following December Howitt again visited
the desolate spot charged with the melancholy mission of bringing back
the remains for interment in Melbourne The chaste and elegant monument
that marks the spot where the heroes sleep is a far less enduring
memorial than exists in the wonderful development and unprecedented
prosperity which mark the colony as the fruit of the labors sufferings
and death of these martyred heroes
A pretty romance is associated with the discovery and naming of Van
Diemens Land A young man Tasman by name who had been scornfully
rejected by a Dutch nabob as the suitor of his daughter resolved to
prove himself worthy of the lady of his heart So while his inamorata
was cruelly imprisoned in the palace of her sire at Batavia young
Tasman instead of wasting time in regrets set forth on a voyage of
adventure seeking to win by prowess what gallantry had failed to
effect On his first voyage he so far circumnavigated the island as to
be convinced of its insular character but really saw little of the
land In subsequent voyages he made extensive explorations calling not
only the mainland but all the little islets he discovered by the
several names and synonyms of Mademoiselle Van Diemen his beloved When
at length he was able to lay before the Dutch government the charts of
his voyages and a digest of his discoveries in the beautiful land where
he had already planted the standard of Holland the cruel sire relented
and consented to receive as a soninlaw the successful adventurer
Tasman it seems never very fully explored the waters that surrounded
his domain and the honor was reserved to two young men Flinders and
Bass of discovering in 1797 the deep wide strait of two hundred and
seventy miles in width that bears the name of Bass The scenery of Van
Diemens Land is full of picturesque beautya sort of miniature
Switzerland with snowclad peaks rocks and ravines foaming cataracts
and multitudinous little lakes with their circling belt of green and
dancing rivulets bordered with flowers The Valley of Launceston is a
very Arcadia of pastoral repose while the Tamarwhich in its whole
course is rather a succession of beautiful lakes than an ordinary
riverwith its narrow defiles basaltic rocks and sparkling cataracts
picturesque rocks that cut off one lake and suddenly reveal another is
a very miracle of beauty dancing frothing foaming like some playful
sprite possessed with the very spirit of mischief
Illustration HOBART TOWN
Hobart Town the capital of Tasmania is a quiet hospitable little
town but a very hotbed of aristocracythe single spot on the
Australian continent where English exclusiveness can after the gay
seasons of the large cities retire to aristocratic countryseats to
nurse and revivify its pride of birth without fear of coming in contact
with anything parvenu or plebeian The town is prettily laid out with a
genuine Gothic chateau for its government palace and elegant private
residences It seems tame and deserted when visited from Sydney or
Melbourne but offers just the rest and refreshment one needs after a
season of exhausting labor in the mines of Ballarat
The rapid growth of the Australian colonies their remoteness from the
mother country and the vastness of the territory over which they are
spread naturally suggest the question whether they are destined to
remain in a condition of dependence or are likely to follow the example
of their American prototypes On this point the opinion of the count of
Beauvoir is entitled to consideration as that of an impartial as well
as intelligent observer He had expected he tells us in visiting the
country to find it preparing for its speedy emancipation but he left
it with the conviction that far from desiring a severance of the
connection the colonists would regard it as a blow to their material
intereststhe one event in fact capable of arresting their
unparalleled progress It can only occur as the result of a European war
in which the power of England shall be so crippled as to disable her
from protecting these distant possessions casting upon them the whole
burden of selfdefence and forcing them to assume the responsibilities
of national existence
