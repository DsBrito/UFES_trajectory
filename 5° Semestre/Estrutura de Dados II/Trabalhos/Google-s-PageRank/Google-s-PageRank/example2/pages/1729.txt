of life This is a kind of ancient state moreover that suits
passably well with provincial thrift The good folk are in fact the
lords of the manor of a bygone age minus the quitrents and heriots
the pack of hounds and the laced coats full of honor among
themselves and one and all loyally devoted to princes whom they only
see at a distance The historical house incognito is as quaint a
survival as a piece of ancient tapestry Vegetating somewhere among
them there is sure to be an uncle or a brother a lieutenantgeneral
an old courtier of the Kingss who wears the red ribbon of the order
of SaintLouis and went to Hanover with the Marechal de Richelieu
and here you will find him like a stray leaf out of some old pamphlet
of the time of Louis Quinze
This fossil greatness finds a rival in another house wealthier
though of less ancient lineage Husband and wife spend a couple of
months of every winter in Paris bringing back with them its frivolous
tone and shortlived contemporary crazes Madame is a woman of
fashion though she looks rather conscious of her clothes and is
always behind the mode She scoffs however at the ignorance affected
by her neighbors Her plate is of modern fashion she has grooms
Negroes a valetdechambre and whatnot Her oldest son drives a
tilbury and does nothing the estate is entailed upon him his
younger brother is auditor to a Council of State The father is well
posted up in official scandals and tells you anecdotes of Louis
XVIII and Madame du Cayla He invests his money in the five per
cents and is careful to avoid the topic of cider but has been known
occasionally to fall a victim to the craze for rectifying the
conjectural sumstotal of the various fortunes of the department He
is a member of the Departmental Council has his clothes from Paris
and wears the Cross of the Legion of Honor In short he is a country
gentleman who has fully grasped the significance of the Restoration
and is coining money at the Chamber but his Royalism is less pure
than that of the rival house he takes the Gazette and the Debats
the other family only read the Quotidienne
His lordship the Bishop a sometime VicarGeneral fluctuates between
the two powers who pay him the respect due to religion but at times
they bring home to him the moral appended by the worthy Lafontaine to
the fable of the Ass laden with Relics The good mans origin is
distinctly plebeian
Then come stars of the second magnitude men of family with ten or
twelve hundred livres a year captains in the navy or cavalry
regiments or nothing at all Out on the roads on horseback they
rank halfway between the cure bearing the sacraments and the tax
collector on his rounds Pretty nearly all of them have been in the
Pages or in the Household Troops and now are peaceably ending their
days in a faisancevaloir more interested in felling timber and the
cider prospects than in the Monarchy
Still they talk of the Charter and the Liberals while the cards are
making or over a game at backgammon when they have exhausted the
usual stock of dots and have married everybody off according to the
genealogies which they all know by heart Their womenkind are haughty
dames who assume the airs of Court ladies in their basket chaises
They huddle themselves up in shawls and caps by way of full dress and
twice a year after ripe deliberation have a new bonnet from Paris
brought as opportunity offers Exemplary wives are they for the most
part and garrulous
These are the principal elements of aristocratic gentility with a few
outlying old maids of good family spinsters who have solved the
problem given a human being to remain absolutely stationary They
might be sealed up in the houses where you see them their faces and
their dresses are literally part of the fixtures of the town and the
province in which they dwell They are its tradition its memory its
quintessence the genius loci incarnate There is something frigid
and monumental about these ladies they know exactly when to laugh and
when to shake their heads and every now and then give out some
utterance which passes current as a witticism
A few rich townspeople have crept into the miniature Faubourg
SaintGermain thanks to their money or their aristocratic leanings
But despite their forty years the circle still say of them Young
Soandso has sound opinions and of such do they make deputies As
a rule the elderly spinsters are their patronesses not without
comment
Finally in this exclusive little set include two or three
ecclesiastics admitted for the sake of their cloth or for their wit
for these great nobles find their own society rather dull and
introduce the bourgeois element into their drawingrooms as a baker
puts leaven into his dough
The sumtotal contained by all heads put together consists of a
certain quantity of antiquated notions a few new inflections brewed
in company of an evening being added from time to time to the common
stock Like seawater in a little creek the phrases which represent
these ideas surge up daily punctually obeying the tidal laws of
conversation in their flow and ebb you hear the hollow echo of
yesterday today tomorrow a year hence and for evermore On all
things here below they pass immutable judgments which go to make up a
body of tradition into which no power of mortal man can infuse one
drop of wit or sense The lives of these persons revolve with the
regularity of clockwork in an orbit of use and wont which admits of no
more deviation or change than their opinions on matters religious
political moral or literary
If a stranger is admitted to the cenacle every member of it in turn
will say not without a trace of irony You will not find the
brilliancy of your Parisian society here and proceed forthwith to
criticise the life led by his neighbors as if he himself were an
exception who had striven and vainly striven to enlighten the rest
But any stranger so ill advised as to concur in any of their freely
expressed criticism of each other is pronounced at once to be an
illnatured person a heathen an outlaw a reprobate Parisian as
Parisians mostly are
Before Gaston de Nueil made his appearance in this little world of
strictly observed etiquette where every detail of life is an
integrant part of a whole and everything is known where the values
of personalty and real estate is quoted like stocks on the vast sheet
of the newspaperbefore his arrival he had been weighed in the
unerring scales of Bayeusaine judgment
His cousin Mme de SainteSevere had already given out the amount of
his fortune and the sum of his expectations had produced the family
tree and expatiated on the talents breeding and modesty of this
particular branch So he received the precise amount of attentions to
which he was entitled he was accepted as a worthy scion of a good
stock and for he was but twentythree was made welcome without
ceremony though certain young ladies and mothers of daughters looked
not unkindly upon him
He had an income of eighteen thousand livres from land in the valley
of the Auge and sooner or later his father as in duty bound would
leave him the chateau of Manerville with the lands thereunto
belonging As for his education political career personal qualities
and qualificationsno one so much as thought of raising the
questions His land was undeniable his rentals steady excellent
plantations had been made the tenants paid for repairs rates and
taxes the appletrees were thirtyeight years old and to crown all
his father was in treaty for two hundred acres of woodland just
outside the paternal park which he intended to enclose with walls No
hopes of a political career no fame on earth can compare with such
advantages as these
Whether out of malice or design Mme de SainteSevere omitted to
mention that Gaston had an elder brother nor did Gaston himself say a
word about him But at the same time it is true that the brother was
consumptive and to all appearance would shortly be laid in earth
lamented and forgotten
At first Gaston de Nueil amused himself at the expense of the circle
He drew as it were for his mental album a series of portraits of
these folk with their angular wrinkled faces and hooked noses
their crotchets and ludicrous eccentricities of dress portraits which
possessed all the racy flavor of truth He delighted in their
Normanisms in the primitive quaintness of their ideas and
characters For a short time he flung himself into their squirrels
life of busy gyrations in a cage Then he began to feel the want of
variety and grew tired of it It was like the life of the cloister
cut short before it had well begun He drifted on till he reached a
crisis which is neither spleen nor disgust but combines all the
symptoms of both When a human being is transplanted into an
uncongenial soil to lead a starved stunted existence there is
always a little discomfort over the transition Then gradually if
nothing removes him from his surroundings he grows accustomed to
them and adapts himself to the vacuity which grows upon him and
renders him powerless Even now Gastons lungs were accustomed to the
air and he was willing to discern a kind of vegetable happiness in
days that brought no mental exertion and no responsibilities The
constant stirring of the sap of life the fertilizing influences of
mind on mind after which he had sought so eagerly in Paris were
beginning to fade from his memory and he was in a fair way of
becoming a fossil with these fossils and ending his days among them
content like the companions of Ulysses in his gross envelope
One evening Gaston de Nueil was seated between a dowager and one of
the vicarsgeneral of the diocese in a graypaneled drawingroom
floored with large white tiles The family portraits which adorned the
walls looked down upon four cardtables and some sixteen persons
gathered about them chattering over their whist Gaston thinking of
nothing digesting one of those exquisite dinners to which the
provincial looks forward all through the day found himself justifying
the customs of the country
He began to understand why these good folk continued to play with
yesterdays pack of cards and shuffle them on a threadbare tablecloth
and how it was that they had ceased to dress for themselves or others
He saw the glimmerings of something like a philosophy in the even
tenor of their perpetual round in the calm of their methodical
monotony in their ignorance of the refinements of luxury Indeed he
almost came to think that luxury profited nothing and even now the
city of Paris with its passions storms and pleasures was scarcely
more than a memory of childhood
He admired in all sincerity the red hands and shy bashful manner of
some young lady who at first struck him as an awkward simpleton
unattractive to the last degree and surprisingly ridiculous His doom
was sealed He had gone from the provinces to Paris he had led the
feverish life of Paris and now he would have sunk back into the
lifeless life of the provinces but for a chance remark which reached
his eara few words that called up a swift rush of such emotion as he
might have felt when a strain of really good music mingles with the
accompaniment of some tedious opera
You went to call on Mme de Beauseant yesterday did you not The
speaker was an elderly lady and she addressed the head of the local
royal family
I went this morning She was so poorly and depressed that I could
not persuade her to dine with us tomorrow
With Mme de Champignelles exclaimed the dowager with something
like astonishment in her manner
With my wife calmly assented the noble Mme de Beauseant is
descended from the House of Burgundy on the spindle side tis true
but the name atones for everything My wife is very much attached to
the Vicomtesse and the poor lady has lived alone for such a long
while that
The Marquis de Champignelles looked round about him while he spoke
with an air of cool unconcern so that it was almost impossible to
guess whether he made a concession to Mme de Beauseants misfortunes
or paid homage to her noble birth whether he felt flattered to
receive her in his house or on the contrary sheer pride was the
motive that led him to try to force the country families to meet the
Vicomtesse
The women appeared to take counsel of each other by a glance there
was a sudden silence in the room and it was felt that their attitude
was one of disapproval
Does this Mme de Beauseant happen to be the lady whose adventure
with M dAjudaPinto made so much noise asked Gaston of his
neighbor
The very same he was told She came to Courcelles after the
marriage of the Marquis dAjuda nobody visits her She has besides
too much sense not to see that she is in a false position so she has
made no attempt to see any one M de Champignelles and a few
gentlemen went to call upon her but she would see no one but M de
Champignelles perhaps because he is a connection of the family They
are related through the Beauseants the father of the present Vicomte
married a Mlle de Champignelles of the older branch But though the
Vicomtesse de Beauseant is supposed to be a descendant of the House of
Burgundy you can understand that we could not admit a wife separated
from her husband into our society here We are foolish enough still to
cling to these oldfashioned ideas There was the less excuse for the
Vicomtesse because M de Beauseant is a wellbred man of the world
who would have been quite ready to listen to reason But his wife is
quite mad and so forth and so forth
M de Nueil still listening to the speakers voice gathered nothing
of the sense of the words his brain was too full of thickcoming
fancies Fancies What other name can you give to the alluring charms
of an adventure that tempts the imagination and sets vague hopes
springing up in the soul to the sense of coming events and mysterious
felicity and fear at hand while as yet there is no substance of fact
on which these phantoms of caprice can fix and feed Over these
fancies thought hovers conceiving impossible projects giving in the
germ all the joys of love Perhaps indeed all passion is contained
in that thoughtgerm as the beauty and fragrance and rich color of
the flower is all packed in the seed
M de Nueil did not know that Mme de Beauseant had taken refuge in
Normandy after a notoriety which women for the most part envy and
condemn especially when youth and beauty in some sort excuse the
transgression Any sort of celebrity bestows an inconceivable
prestige Apparently for women as for families the glory of the
crime effaces the stain and if such and such a noble house is proud
of its tale of heads that have fallen on the scaffold a young and
pretty woman becomes more interesting for the dubious renown of a
happy love or a scandalous desertion and the more she is to be
pitied the more she excites our sympathies We are only pitiless to
the commonplace If moreover we attract all eyes we are to all
intents and purposes great how indeed are we to be seen unless we
raise ourselves above other peoples heads The common herd of
humanity feels an involuntary respect for any person who can rise
above it and is not overparticular as to the means by which they
rise
It may have been that some such motives influenced Gaston de Nueil at
unawares or perhaps it was curiosity or a craving for some interest
in his life or in a word that crowd of inexplicable impulses which
for want of a better name we are wont to call fatality that drew
him to Mme de Beauseant
The figure of the Vicomtesse de Beauseant rose up suddenly before him
with gracious thronging associations She was a new world for him a
world of fears and hopes a world to fight for and to conquer
Inevitably he felt the contrast between this vision and the human
beings in the shabby room and then in truth she was a woman what
woman had he seen so far in this dull little world where calculation
replaced thought and feeling where courtesy was a cutanddried
formality and ideas of the very simplest were too alarming to be
received or to pass current The sound of Mme de Beauseants name
revived a young mans dreams and wakened urgent desires that had lain
dormant for a little
Gaston de Nueil was absentminded and preoccupied for the rest of the
evening He was pondering how he might gain access to Mme de
Beauseant and truly it was no very easy matter She was believed to
be extremely clever But if men and women of parts may be captivated
by something subtle or eccentric they are also exacting and can read
all that lies below the surface and after the first step has been
taken the chances of failure and success in the difficult task of
pleasing them are about even In this particular case moreover the
Vicomtesse besides the pride of her position had all the dignity of
her name Her utter seclusion was the least of the barriers raised
between her and the world For which reasons it was wellnigh
impossible that a stranger however well born could hope for
admittance and yet the next morning found M de Nueil taking his
walks abroad in the direction of Courcelles a dupe of illusions
natural at his age Several times he made the circuit of the garden
walls looking earnestly through every gap at the closed shutters or
open windows hoping for some romantic chance on which he founded
schemes for introducing himself into this unknown ladys presence
without a thought of their impracticability Morning after morning was
spent in this way to mighty purpose but with each days walk that
vision of a woman living apart from the world of loves martyr buried
in solitude loomed larger in his thoughts and was enshrined in his
soul So Gaston de Nueil walked under the walls of Courcelles and
some gardeners heavy footstep would set his heart beating high with
hope
He thought of writing to Mme de Beauseant but on mature
consideration what can you say to a woman whom you have never seen a
complete stranger And Gaston had little selfconfidence Like most
young persons with a plentiful crop of illusions still standing he
dreaded the mortifying contempt of silence more than death itself and
shuddered at the thought of sending his first tender epistle forth to
face so many chances of being thrown on the fire He was distracted by
innumerable conflicting ideas But by dint of inventing chimeras
weaving romances and cudgeling his brains he hit at last upon one of
the hopeful stratagems that are sure to occur to your mind if you
persevere long enough a stratagem which must make clear to the most
inexperienced woman that here was a man who took a fervent interest in
her The caprice of social conventions puts as many barriers between
lovers as any Oriental imagination can devise in the most delightfully
fantastic tale indeed the most extravagant pictures are seldom
exaggerations In real life as in the fairy tales the woman belongs
to him who can reach her and set her free from the position in which
she languishes The poorest of calenders that ever fell in love with
the daughter of the Khalif is in truth scarcely further from his lady
than Gaston de Nueil from Mme de Beauseant The Vicomtesse knew
absolutely nothing of M de Nueils wanderings round her house Gaston
de Nueils love grew to the height of the obstacles to overleap and
the distance set between him and his extemporized ladylove produced
the usual effect of distance in lending enchantment
One day confident in his inspiration he hoped everything from the
love that must pour forth from his eyes Spoken words in his opinion
were more eloquent than the most passionate letter and besides he
would engage feminine curiosity to plead for him He went therefore
to M de Champignelles proposing to employ that gentleman for the
better success of his enterprise He informed the Marquis that he had
been entrusted with a delicate and important commission which
concerned the Vicomtesse de Beauseant that he felt doubtful whether
she would read a letter written in an unknown handwriting or put
confidence in a stranger Would M de Champignelles on his next
visit ask the Vicomtesse if she would consent to receive himGaston
de Nueil While he asked the Marquis to keep his secret in case of a
refusal he very ingeniously insinuated sufficient reasons for his own
admittance to be duly passed on to the Vicomtesse Was not M de
Champignelles a man of honor a loyal gentleman incapable of lending
himself to any transaction in bad taste nay the merest suspicion of
bad taste Love lends a young man all the selfpossession and astute
craft of an old ambassador all the Marquis harmless vanities were
gratified and the haughty grandee was completely duped He tried hard
to fathom Gastons secret but the latter who would have been greatly
perplexed to tell it turned off M de Champignelles adroit
questioning with a Normans shrewdness till the Marquis as a gallant
Frenchman complimented his young visitor upon his discretion
M de Champignelles hurried off at once to Courcelles with that
eagerness to serve a pretty woman which belongs to his time of life
In the Vicomtesse de Beauseants position such a message was likely
to arouse keen curiosity so although her memory supplied no reason
at all that could bring M de Nueil to her house she saw no objection
to his visitafter some prudent inquiries as to his family and
condition At the same time she began by a refusal Then she
discussed the propriety of the matter with M de Champignelles
directing her questions so as to discover if possible whether he
knew the motives for the visit and finally revoked her negative
answer The discussion and the discretion shown perforce by the
Marquis had piqued her curiosity
M de Champignelles had no mind to cut a ridiculous figure He said
with the air of a man who can keep anothers counsel that the
Vicomtesse must know the purpose of this visit perfectly well while
the Vicomtesse in all sincerity had no notion what it could be Mme
de Beauseant in perplexity connected Gaston with people whom he had
never met went astray after various wild conjectures and asked
herself if she had seen this M de Nueil before In truth no
loveletter however sincere or skilfully indited could have produced
so much effect as this riddle Again and again Mme de Beauseant
puzzled over it
When Gaston heard that he might call upon the Vicomtesse his rapture
at so soon obtaining the ardently longedfor good fortune was mingled
with singular embarrassment How was he to contrive a suitable sequel
to this stratagem
Bah I shall see her he said over and over again to himself as he
dressed See her and that is everything
He fell to hoping that once across the threshold of Courcelles he
should find an expedient for unfastening this Gordian knot of his own
tying There are believers in the omnipotence of necessity who never
turn back the close presence of danger is an inspiration that calls
out all their powers for victory Gaston de Nueil was one of these
He took particular pains with his dress imagining as youth is apt to
imagine that success or failure hangs on the position of a curl and
ignorant of the fact that anything is charming in youth And in any
case such women as Mme de Beauseant are only attracted by the charms
of wit or character of an unusual order Greatness of character
flatters their vanity promises a great passion seems to imply a
comprehension of the requirements of their hearts Wit amuses them
responds to the subtlety of their natures and they think that they
are understood And what do all women wish but to be amused
understood or adored It is only after much reflection on the things
of life that we understand the consummate coquetry of neglect of dress
and reserve at a first interview and by the time we have gained
sufficient astuteness for successful strategy we are too old to
profit by our experience
While Gastons lack of confidence in his mental equipment drove him to
borrow charms from his clothes Madame de Beauseant herself was
instinctively giving more attention to her toilette
I would rather not frighten people at all events she said to
herself as she arranged her hair
In M de Nueils character person and manner there was that touch of
unconscious originality which gives a kind of flavor to things that
any one might say or do and absolves everything that they may choose
to do or say He was highly cultivated he had a keen brain and a
face mobile as his own nature which won the goodwill of others The
promise of passion and tenderness in the bright eyes was fulfilled by
an essentially kindly heart The resolution which he made as he
entered the house at Courcelles was in keeping with his frank nature
and ardent imagination But bold has he was with love his heart beat
violently when he had crossed the great court laid out like an
English garden and the manservant who had taken his name to the
Vicomtesse returned to say that she would receive him
M le Baron de Nueil
Gaston came in slowly but with sufficient ease of manner and it is a
more difficult thing be it said to enter a room where there is but
one woman than a room that holds a score
A great fire was burning on the hearth in spite of the mild weather
and by the soft light of the candles in the sconces he saw a young
woman sitting on a highbacked bergere in the angle by the hearth
The seat was so low that she could move her head freely every turn of
it was full of grace and delicate charm whether she bent leaning
forward or raised and held it erect slowly and languidly as though
it were a heavy burden so low that she could cross her feet and let
them appear or draw them back under the folds of a long black dress
The Vicomtesse made as if she would lay the book that she was reading
on a small round stand but as she did so she turned towards M de
Nueil and the volume insecurely laid upon the edge fell to the
ground between the stand and the sofa This did not seem to disconcert
her She looked up bowing almost imperceptibly in response to his
greeting without rising from the depths of the low chair in which she
lay Bending forwards she stirred the fire briskly and stooped to
pick up a fallen glove drawing it mechanically over her left hand
while her eyes wandered in search of its fellow The glance was
instantly checked however for she stretched out a thin white
allbuttransparent right hand with flawless ovals of rosecolored
nail at the tips of the slender ringless fingers and pointed to a
chair as if to bid Gaston be seated He sat down and she turned her
face questioningly towards him Words cannot describe the subtlety of
the winning charm and inquiry in that gesture deliberate in its
kindliness gracious yet accurate in expression it was the outcome of
early education and of a constant use and wont of the graciousness of
life These movements of hers so swift so deft succeeded each other
by the blending of a pretty womans fastidious carelessness with the
highbred manner of a great lady
Mme de Beauseant stood out in such strong contrast against the
automatons among whom he had spent two months of exile in that
outoftheworld district of Normandy that he could not but find in
her the realization of his romantic dreams and on the other hand
he could not compare her perfections with those of other women whom he
had formerly admired Here in her presence in a drawingroom like some
salon in the Faubourg SaintGermain full of costly trifles lying
about upon the tables and flowers and books he felt as if he were
back in Paris It was a real Parisian carpet beneath his feet he saw
once more the highbred type of Parisienne the fragile outlines of
her form her exquisite charm her disdain of the studied effects
which did so much to spoil provincial women
Mme de Beauseant had fair hair and dark eyes and the pale complexion
that belongs to fair hair She held up her brow nobly like some fallen
angel grown proud through the fall disdainful of pardon Her way of
gathering her thick hair into a crown of plaits above the broad
curving lines of the bandeaux upon her forehead added to the
queenliness of her face Imagination could discover the ducal coronet
of Burgundy in the spiral threads of her golden hair all the courage
of her house seemed to gleam from the great ladys brilliant eyes
such courage as women use to repel audacity or scorn for they were
full of tenderness for gentleness The outline of that little head so
admirably poised above the long white throat the delicate fine
features the subtle curves of the lips the mobile face itself wore
an expression of delicate discretion a faint semblance of irony
suggestive of craft and insolence Yet it would have been difficult to
refuse forgiveness to those two feminine failings in her for the
lines that came out in her forehead whenever her face was not in
repose like her upward glances that pathetic trick of manner told
unmistakably of unhappiness of a passion that had all but cost her
her life A woman sitting in the great silent salon a woman cut off
from the rest of the world in this remote little valley alone with
the memories of her brilliant happy and impassioned youth of
continual gaiety and homage paid on all sides now replaced by the
horrors of the voidwas there not something in the sight to strike
awe that deepened with reflection Consciousness of her own value
lurked in her smile She was neither wife nor mother she was an
outlaw she had lost the one heart that could set her pulses beating
without shame she had nothing from without to support her reeling
soul she must even look for strength from within live her own life
cherish no hope save that of forsaken love which looks forward to
Deaths coming and hastens his lagging footsteps And this while life
was in its prime Oh to feel destined for happiness and to dienever
having given nor received it A woman too What pain was this These
thoughts flashing across M de Nueils mind like lightning left him
very humble in the presence of the greatest charm with which woman can
be invested The triple aureole of beauty nobleness and misfortune
dazzled him he stood in dreamy almost openmouthed admiration of the
Vicomtesse But he found nothing to say to her
Mme de Beauseant by no means displeased no doubt by his surprise
held out her hand with a kindly but imperious gesture then summoning
a smile to her pale lips as if obeying even yet the womans impulse
to be gracious
I have heard from M de Champignelles of a message which you have
kindly undertaken to deliver monsieur she said Can it be
from
With that terrible phrase Gaston understood even more clearly than
before his own ridiculous position the bad taste and bad faith of
his behavior towards a woman so noble and so unfortunate He reddened
The thoughts that crowded in upon him could be read in his troubled
eyes but suddenly with the courage which youth draws from a sense of
its own wrongdoing he gained confidence and very humbly interrupted
Mme de Beauseant
Madame he faltered out I do not deserve the happiness of seeing
you I have deceived you basely However strong the motive may have
been it can never excuse the pitiful subterfuge which I used to gain
my end But madame if your goodness will permit me to tell you
The Vicomtesse glanced at M de Nueil haughty disdain in her whole
manner She stretched her hand to the bell and rang it
Jacques she said light this gentleman to the door and she
