Why then have we written it For no other purpose than to annoy the
public and offend its tastes
By no means
Living as we do in the nineteenth century in an age of universal
suffrage of democracy of liberalism we asked ourselves the question
whether what are called the lower classes had no rights in the novel
if that world beneath a world the common people must needs remain
subject to the literary interdict and helpless against the contempt of
authors who have hitherto said no word to imply that the common people
possess a heart and soul We asked ourselves whether in these days of
equality in which we live there are classes unworthy the notice of the
author and the reader misfortunes too lowly dramas too foulmouthed
catastrophes too commonplace in the terror they inspire We were curious
to know if that conventional symbol of a forgotten literature of a
vanished society Tragedy is definitely dead if in a country where
castes no longer exist and aristocracy has no legal status the miseries
of the lowly and the poor would appeal to public interest emotion
compassion as forcibly as the miseries of the great and the rich if
in a word the tears that are shed in low life have the same power to
cause tears to flow as the tears shed in high life
These thoughts led us to venture upon the humble tale Soeur
Philomene in 1861 they lead us to put forth Germinie Lacerteux
today
Now let the book be spoken slightingly of it matters little At this
day when the sphere of the Novel is broadening and expanding when it
is beginning to be the serious impassioned living form of literary
study and social investigation when it is becoming by virtue of
analysis and psychological research the true History of contemporary
morals when the novel has taken its place among the necessary elements
of knowledge it may properly demand its liberty and freedom of speech
And to encourage it in the search for Art and Truth to authorize it to
disclose misery and suffering which it is not well for the fortunate
people of Paris to forget and to show to people of fashion what the
Sisters of Charity have the courage to see for themselves what the
queens of old compelled their children to touch with their eyes in the
hospitals the visible palpitating human suffering that teaches
charity to confirm the novel in the practice of that religion which the
last century called by the vast and farreaching name Humanityit
needs no other warrant than the consciousness that that is its right

SECOND PREFACE
PREPARED FOR A POSTHUMOUS EDITION OF GERMINIE LACERTEUX
July 22 1862The disease is gradually doing its work of destruction
in our poor Rose It is as if the immaterial manifestations of life that
formerly emanated from her body were dying one by one Her face is
entirely changed Her expression is not the same her gestures are not
the same and she seems to me as if she were putting off every day more
and more of that something humanly speaking indefinable which makes
the personality of a living being Disease before making an end of its
victim introduces into his body something strange unfamiliar
something that is not he makes of him a new being so to speak in
whom we must seek to find the former beinghe whose joyous
affectionate features have already ceased to exist
July 31Doctor Simon is to tell me very soon whether our dear old
Rose will live or die I am waiting to hear his ring which to me is
equivalent to that of a jury at the assizes announcing their return to
the court room with their verdict It is all over there is no hope it
is simply a question of time The disease has progressed very rapidly
One lung is entirely gone and the other substantially And we must
return to the invalid restore her serenity with a smile give her
reason to hope for convalescence in every line of our faces Then we
feel an unconquerable longing to rush from the room and from the poor
creature We leave the house we wander at random through the streets
at last overdone with fatigue we sit down at a table in a cafe We
mechanically take up a copy of LIllustration and our eyes fall at
once upon the solution of its last riddle Against death there is no
appeal
Monday August 11The disease of the lungs is complicated with
peritonitis She has terrible pains in the bowels she cannot move
without assistance she cannot lie on her back or her left side In
Gods name is not death enough must she also endure suffering aye
torture as the final implacable breakingup of the human organism And
she suffers thus poor wretch in one of the servants rooms where the
sun shining in through a window in the sloping roof makes the air as
stifling as in a hothouse and where there is so little room that the
doctor has to put his hat on the bed We struggled to the last to keep
her but finally we had to make up our minds to let her go away She was
unwilling to go to Maison Dubois where we proposed to take her it
seems that twentyfive years ago when she first came to us she went
there to see the nurse in charge of Edmond who died there and so that
particular hospital represents to her the place where people die I am
waiting for Simon who is to bring her a permit to go to Lariboisiere
She passed almost a good night She is all ready in high spirits in
fact We have covered everything up from her as well as we could She
longs to be gone She is in a great hurry She feels that she is going
to get well there At two oclock Simon arrives Here it is all
right She refuses to have a litter I should think I was dead she
says She is dressed As soon as she leaves her bed all the signs of
life to be seen upon her face disappear It is as if the earth had risen
under her skin She comes down into our apartments Sitting in the
diningroom with a trembling hand the knuckles of which knock against
one another she draws her stockings on over a pair of legs like
broomsticks consumptive legs Then for a long moment she looks about
at the familiar objects with dying eyes that seem desirous to take away
with them the memory of the places they are leavingand the door of the
apartment closes upon her with a noise as of farewell She reaches the
foot of the stairs where she rests for an instant on a chair The
concierge in a bantering tone assures her that she will be well in six
weeks She bows and says yes an inaudible yes The cab drives up to
the door She rests her hand on the concierges wife I hold her
against the pillow she has behind her back With wide open vacant eyes
she vaguely watches the houses pass but she does not speak At the door
of the hospital she tries to alight without assistance Can you walk so
far the concierge asks She makes an affirmative gesture and walks on
Really I cannot imagine where she procured the strength to walk as she
does Here we are at last in the great hall a high cold bare clean
place with a litter standing all ready for use in the centre I seat
her in a straw armchair by a door with a glazed wicket A young man
opens the wicket asks my name and age and writes busily for quarter of
an hour covering ten or more sheets of paper with a religious figure at
the head At last everything is ready and I embrace her A boy takes
one arm the housekeeper the otherAfter that I saw nothing more
Thursday August 14We have been to Lariboisiere We found Rose
quiet hopeful talking of her approaching dischargein three weeks at
mostand so free from all thought of death that she told us of a
furious love scene that took place yesterday between a woman in the bed
next hers and a brother of the Christian schools who was there again
today Poor Rose is death but death engrossed with life Near her bed
was a young woman whose husband a mechanic had come to see her You
see as soon as I can walk I shall walk about the garden so much that
theyll have to send me home she said And the mother in her added
Does the child ask for me sometimes
Sometimes oh yes the man replied
Saturday August 16This morning at ten oclock someone rings the
bell I hear a colloquy at the door between the housekeeper and the
concierge The door opens the concierge enters with a letter I take
the letter it bears the stamp of Lariboisiere Rose died this morning
at seven oclock
Poor girl So it is all over I knew that she was doomed but she was so
animated so cheerful almost happy when we saw her Thursday And here
we are both walking up and down the salon filled with the thought that
a fellowcreatures death inspires We shall never see her againan
instinctive thought that recurs incessantly within you What a void
what a gap in our household A habit an attachment of twentyfive years
growth a girl who knew our whole lives and opened our letters in our
absence and to whom we told all our business When I was a bit of a boy
I trundled my hoop with her and she bought me appletarts with her own
money when we went to walk She would sit up for Edmond till morning
to open the door for him when he went to the Bal de lOpera without our
mothers knowledge She was the woman the excellent nurse whose hands
mother placed in ours when she was dying She had the keys to
everything she managed everything she did everything for our comfort
For twentyfive years she tucked us up in bed every night and every
night there were the same neverending jokes about her ugliness and her
disgraceful physique Sorrows and joys alike she shared with us She was
one of those devoted creatures upon whose solicitude you rely to close
your eyes Our bodies when we were ill or indisposed were accustomed
to her attentions She was familiar with all our hobbies She had known
all our mistresses She was a piece of our life part of the furniture
of our apartment a stray memory of our youth at once loving and
scolding and caretaking like a watchdog whom we were accustomed to
having always beside us and about us and who ought to last as long as
ourselves And we shall never see her again It is not she moving about
the rooms she will never again come to our rooms to bid us
goodmorning It is a great wrench a great change in our lives which
seems to us I cannot say why like one of those solemn breaks in ones
existence when as Byron says destiny changes horses
Sunday August 17This morning we are to perform all the last sad
duties We must return to the hospital enter once more the reception
hall where I seem to see again in the armchair against the wicket the
ghost of the emaciated creature I seated there less than a week ago
Will you identify the body the attendant hurls the question at me in
a harsh voice We go to the further end of the hospital to a high
yellow door upon which is written in great black letters
Amphitheatre The attendant knocks After some moments the door is
partly opened and a head like a butchers boys appears with a short
pipe in its mouth a head which suggests the gladiator and the
gravedigger I fancied that I was at the circus and that he was the
slave who received the gladiators bodies and he does receive the slain
in that great circus society They made us wait a long while before
opening another door and during those moments of suspense all our
courage oozed away as the blood of a wounded man who is forced to
remain standing oozes away drop by drop The mystery of what we were
about to see the horror of a sight that rends your heart the search
for the one body amid other bodies the scrutiny and recognition of that
poor face disfigured doubtlessthe thought of all this made us as
timid as children We were at the end of our strength at the end of our
willpower at the end of our nervous tension and when the door
opened we said We will send some one and fled From there we went
to the mayors office riding in a cab that jolted us and shook our
heads about like empty things And an indefinable horror seized upon us
of death in a hospital which seems to be only an administrative
formality One would say that in that abode of agony everything is so
well administered regulated reduced to system that death opens it as
if it were an administrative bureau
While we were having the death registeredMon Dieu the paper all
covered with writing and flourishes for a poor womans deatha man
rushed out of an adjoining room in joyous exultation and looked at the
almanac hanging on the wall to find the name of the saint of the day and
give it to his child As he passed the skirt of the happy fathers coat
swept the sheet on which the death was registered from the desk to the
floor
When we returned home we must look through her papers get her clothes
together sort out the clutter of phials bandages and innumerable
things that sickness collectsjostle death about in short It was a
ghastly thing to enter that attic where the crumbs of bread from her
last meal were still lying in the folds of the bedclothes I threw the
coverlid up over the bolster like a sheet over the ghost of a dead man
Monday August 18The chapel is beside the amphitheatre In the
hospital God and the dead body are neighbors At the mass said for the
poor woman beside her coffin two or three others were placed near by to
reap the benefit of the service There was an unpleasant promiscuousness
of salvation in that performance it resembled the common grave in the
prayer Behind me in the chapel Roses niece was weepingthe little
girl she had at our house for a short time who is now a young woman of
nineteen a pupil at the convent of the Sisters of SaintLaurent a
poor weazened pale stunted creature rickety from starvation with a
head too heavy for her body back bent double and the air of a
Mayeuxthe last sad remnant of that consumptionridden family awaited
by Death and with his hand even now heavy upon herin her soft eyes
there is already a gleam of the life beyond
Then from the chapel to the extreme end of the Montmartre
cemeteryvast as a necropolis and occupying a whole quarter of the
citywalking at slow steps through mud that never ends Lastly the
intoning of the priests and the coffin laboriously lowered by the
gravediggers arms to the ends of the ropes as a cask of wine is
lowered into a cellar
Wednesday August 20Once more I must return to the hospital For
since the visit I paid Rose on Thursday and her sudden death the next
day there has existed for me a mystery which I force from my thoughts
but which constantly returns the mystery of that agony of which I know
nothing of that sudden end I long to know and I dread to learn It
does not seem to me as if she were dead I think of her simply as of a
person who has disappeared My imagination returns to her last hours
gropes for them in the darkness and reconstructs them and they torture
me with their veiled horrors I need to have my doubts resolved At
last this morning I took my courage in both hands Again I see the
hospital again I see the redfaced obese concierge reeking with life
as one reeks with wine and the corridors where the morning light falls
upon the pale faces of smiling convalescents
In a distant corner I rang at a door with little white curtains It was
opened and I found myself in a parlor where a Virgin stood upon a sort
of altar between two windows On the northern wall of the room the
cold bare room there arewhy I cannot explaintwo framed views of
Vesuvius wretched watercolors which seem to shiver and to be entirely
expatriated there Through an open door behind me from a small room in
which the sun shines brightly I hear the chattering of sisters and
children childish joys pretty little bursts of laughter all sorts of
fresh clear vocal notes a sound as from a dovecote bathed in the sun
Sisters in white with black caps pass and repass one stops in front of
my chair She is short badly developed with an ugly sweet face a
poor face by the grace of God She is the mother of the Salle
SaintJoseph She tells me how Rose died in hardly any pain feeling
that she was improving almost well overflowing with encouragement and
hope In the morning after her bed was made without any suspicion that
death was near suddenly she was taken with a hemorrhage which lasted
some few seconds I came away much comforted delivered from the
thought that she had had the anticipatory taste of death the horror of
its approach
Thursday October 21
In the midst of our dinner which was rendered melancholy enough by the
constant hovering of the conversation around the subject of death
Maria who came to dinner tonight cried out after two or three
nervous blows with her fingers upon her fluffy blonde locksMy
friends while the poor girl was alive I kept the professional secret
of my trade But now that she is under ground you must know the
truth
And thereupon we learned things concerning the unhappy creature that
took away our appetites leaving in our mouths the bitter taste of fruit
cut with a steel knife And a whole strange hateful repugnant
deplorable existence was revealed to us The notes she signed the debts
she has left behind her at all the dealers have the most unforeseen
the most amazing the most incredible basis She kept men the
milkwomans son for whom she furnished a chamber another to whom she
carried our wine chickens food of all sorts A secret life of
nocturnal orgies of nights passed abroad of fierce nymphomania that
made her lovers say Either she or I will stay on the field A
passion passions with her whole head and heart and all her senses at
once and complicated by all the wretched creatures diseases
consumption which adds frenzy to pleasure hysteria the beginning of
insanity She had two children by the milkwomans son one of whom lived
six months Some years ago when she told us that she was going on a
visit to her province it was to lie in And with regard to these men
her passion was so extravagant so unhealthy so insane that she who
was formerly honesty personified actually stole from us took twenty
franc pieces out of rolls of a hundred francs so that the lovers she
paid might not leave her Now after these involuntarily dishonest acts
these petty crimes extorted from her upright nature she plunged into
such depths of selfreproach remorse melancholy such black despair
that in that hell in which she rolled on from sin to sin desperate and
unsatisfied she had taken to drinking to escape herself to save
herself from the present to drown herself and founder for a few moments
in the heavy slumber the lethargic torpor in which she would lie
wallowing across her bed for a whole day just as she fell when she
tried to make it The miserable creature how great an incentive how
many motives and reasons she found for devouring her suffering and
bleeding internally in the first place the rejection at intervals of
religious ideas by the terrors of a hell of fire and brimstone then
jealousy that characteristic jealousy of everything and everybody that
poisoned her life then thenthen the disgust which these men after a
time brutally expressed for her ugliness and which drove her deeper
and deeper into sottishnesscaused her one day to have a miscarriage
and she fell half dead on the floor Such a frightful tearing away of
the veil we have worn over our eyes is like the examination of a
pocketful of horrible things in a dead body suddenly opened From what
we have heard I suddenly seem to realize what she must have suffered for
ten years past the dread of an anonymous letter to us or of a
denunciation from some dealer and the constant trepidation on the
subject of the money that was demanded of her and that she could not
pay and the shame felt by that proud creature perverted by the vile
Quartier SaintGeorges because of her intimacy with low wretches whom
she despised and the lamentable consciousness of the premature senility
caused by drunkenness and the inhuman exactions and brutality of the
Alphonses of the gutter and the temptations to suicide which caused me
to pull her away from a window one day when I found her leaning far
outand lastly all the tears that we believed to be without causeall
these things mingled with a very deep and heartfelt affection for us
and with a vehement feverish devotion when either of us was ill And
this woman possessed an energetic character a force of will a skill in
mystification to which nothing can be compared Yes yes all those
frightful secrets kept under lock and key hidden buried deep in her
own heart so that neither our eyes nor our ears nor our powers of
observation ever detected aught amiss even in her hysterical attacks
when nothing escaped her but groans a mystery preserved until her
death and which she must have believed would be buried with her And of
what did she die She died because all through one rainy winters
night eight months ago at Montmartre she spied upon the milkwomans
son who had turned her away in order to find out with what woman he
had filled her place a whole night leaning against a groundfloor
window as a result of which she was drenched to the bones with deadly
pleurisy
Poor creature we forgive her indeed a vast compassion for her fills
our hearts as we reflect upon all that she has suffered But we have
become suspicious for our lives of the whole female sex and of women
above us as well as of women below us in station We are terrorstricken
at the double lining of their hearts at the marvelous faculty the
science the consummate genius of falsehood with which their whole being
is instinct

EDMOND DE GONCOURT
Auteuil April 1886
I
Saved so you are really out of danger mademoiselle exclaimed the
maid with a cry of joy as she closed the door upon the doctor and
rushing to the bed on which her mistress lay she began in a frenzy of
happiness and with a shower of kisses to embrace together with the bed
covers the old womans poor emaciated body which seemed in the huge
bed as small as a childs
The old woman took her head silently in both hands pressed it against
her heart heaved a sigh and muttered Ah well so I must live on
This took place in a small room through the window of which could be
seen a small patch of sky cut by three black iron pipes various
neighboring roofs and in the distance between two houses that almost
touched the leafless branch of a tree whose trunk was invisible
On the mantelpiece in a mahogany box was a square clock with a large
dial huge figures and bulky hands Beside it under glass covers were
two candlesticks formed by three silver swans twisting their necks
around a golden quiver Near the fireplace an easy chair a la
Voltaire covered with one of the pieces of tapestry of checkerboard
pattern which little girls and old women make extended its empty arms
Two little Italian landscapes a flower piece in watercolors after
Bertin with a date in red ink at the bottom and a few miniatures hung
on the walls
Upon the mahogany commode of an Empire pattern a statue of Time in
black bronze running with his scythe in rest served as a watch stand
for a small watch with a monogram in diamonds upon blue enamel
surrounded with pearls The floor was covered with a bright carpet with
black and green stripes The curtains at the bed and the window were of
oldfashioned chintz with red figures upon a chocolate ground
At the head of the bed a portrait inclined over the invalid and seemed
to gaze sternly at her It represented a man with harsh features whose
face emerged from the high collar of a green satin coat and a muslin
cravat with waving ends tied loosely around the neck in the style of
the early years of the Revolution The old woman in the bed resembled
the portrait She had the same bushy commanding black eyebrows the
same aquiline nose the same clearly marked lines of will resolution
and energy The portrait seemed to cast a reflection upon her as a
fathers face is reflected in his childs But in hers the harshness of
the features was softened by a gleam of rough kindliness by an
indefinable flame of sturdy devotion and masculine charity
The light in the room was the light of an evening in early spring about
five oclock a light as clear as crystal and as white as silver the
cold chaste soft light which fades away in the flush of the sunset
passing into twilight The sky was filled with that light of a new life
adorably melancholy like the still naked earth and so replete with
pathos that it moves happy souls to tears
Well well my silly Germinie weeping said the old woman a moment
later withdrawing her hands which were moist with her maids kisses
Oh my dear kind mademoiselle I would like to weep like this all the
time its so good it brings my poor mother back before my eyesand
everythingif you only knew
Go on go on said her mistress closing her eyes to listen tell me
about it
Oh my poor mother The maid paused a moment Then with the flood of
words that gushes forth with tears of joy she continued as if in the
emotion and outpouring of her happiness her whole childhood flowed back
into her heart Poor woman I can see her now the last time she went
out to take me to mass one 21st of January I remember In those days
they read from the kings Testament Ah she suffered enough on my
account did mamma She was fortytwo years old when I was bornpapa
made her cry a good deal There were three of us before and there wasnt
any too much bread in the house And then he was proud as anything If
wed had only a handful of peas in the house he would never have gone to
the cure for help Ah we didnt eat bacon every day at our house Never
mind for all that mamma loved me a little more and she always found a
little fat or cheese in some corner to put on my bread I wasnt five
when she died That was a bad thing for us all I had a tall brother
who was white as a sheet with a yellow beardand good you have no
idea Everybody loved him They gave him all sorts of names Some called
him Bodawhy I dont know Others called him Jesus Christ Ah he was
a worker he was It didnt make any difference to him that his health
was good for nothing at daybreak he was always at his loomfor we were
weavers you must knowand he never put his shuttle down till night
And honest too if you knew People came from all about to bring him
their yarn and without weighing it too He was a great friend of the
schoolmaster and he used to write the mottoes for the carnival My
father he was a different sort hed work for a moment or an hour you
know and then hed go off into the fieldsand when he came home hed
beat us and beat us hard He was like a madman they said it was
because he was consumptive It was lucky my brother was there he used
to prevent my second sister from pulling my hair and hurting me because
she was jealous He always took me by the hand to go and see them play
skittles In fact he supported the family all alone For my first
communion he had the bells rung Ah he did a heap of work so that I
should be like the others in a little white dress with flounces and a
little bag in my hand such as they used to carry in those days I
didnt have any cap I remember making myself a pretty little wreath of
ribbons and the white pith you pull off when you strip reeds there was
lots of it in the places where we used to put the hemp to soak That was
one of my great daysthat and the drawing lots for the pigs at
Christmasand the days when I went to help them tie up the vines that
was in June you know We had a little vineyard near Saint Hilaire
There was one very hard year in those daysdo you remember it
mademoisellethe long frost of 1828 that ruined everything It
extended as far as Dijon and farther toopeople had to make bread from
bran My brother nearly killed himself with work Father who was always
out of doors tramping about the fields sometimes brought home a few
mushrooms It was pretty bad all the same we were hungry oftener than
anything else When I was out in the fields myself Id look around to
see if anyone could see me and then Id crawl along softly on my knees
and when I was under a cow Id take off one of my sabots and begin to
milk her Bless me I came near being caught at it My oldest sister was
out at service with the Mayor of Lenclos and she sent home her
wagestwentyfour francsit was always as much as that The second
worked at dressmaking in bourgeois families but they didnt pay the
prices then that they do today she worked from six in the morning till
dark for eight sous Out of that she wanted to put some by for a dress
for the fete on SaintRemis dayAh thats the way it is with us
there are many who live on two potatoes a day for six months so as to
have a new dress for that day Bad luck fell on us on all sides My
father died We had to sell a small field and a bit of a vineyard that
yielded a cask of wine every year The notaries dont work for nothing
When my brother was sick there was nothing to give him to drink but
lees that wed been putting water to for a year And there wasnt any
change of linen for him all the sheets in the wardrobe which had a
golden cross on top of it in mothers time had goneand the cross too
More than that before he was sick this time my brother goes off to the
fete at Clefmont He hears someone say that my sister had gone wrong
with the mayor she worked for he falls on the men who said it but he
wasnt very strong They were though and they threw him down and when
he was down they kicked him with their wooden shoes in the pit of the
stomach He was brought home to us for dead The doctor put him on his
feet again though and told us he was cured But he could just drag
himself along I could see that he was going when he kissed me When he
was dead poor dear boy Cadet Ballard had to use all his strength to
take me away from the body The whole village mayor and all went to
his funeral As my sister couldnt keep her place with the mayor on
account of the things he said to her and had gone to Paris to find a
place my other sister went after her I was left all alone One of my
mothers cousins then took me with her to Damblin but I was all upset
there I cried all night long and whenever I could run away I always
went back to our house Just to see the old vine at our door from the
end of the street did me good it put strength into my legs The good
people who had bought the house would keep me till someone came for me
they were always sure to find me there At last they wrote to my sister
in Paris that if she didnt send for me to come and live with her I
wasnt likely to live long Its a fact that I was just like wax They
put me in charge of the driver of a small wagon that went from Langres
to Paris every month and thats how I came to Paris I was fourteen
years old then I remember that I went to bed all dressed all the way
because they made me sleep in the common room When I arrived I was
covered with lice
II
The old woman said nothing she was comparing her own life with her
servants
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil was born in 1782 She first saw the light in
a mansion on Rue Royale and Mesdames de France were her sponsors in
baptism Her father was a close friend of the Comte dArtois in whose
household he held an important post He joined in all his
huntingparties and was one of the few familiar spirits in whose
presence at the mass preceding the hunt he who was one day to be King
Charles X used to hurry the officiating priest by saying in an
undertone Psit psit cure swallow your Good Lord quickly
Monsieur de Varandeuil had made one of those marriages which were
customary enough in his day he had espoused a sort of actress a
singer who although she had no great talent had made a success at the
Concert Spirituel beside Madame Todi Madame Ponteuil and Madame
SaintHuberty The little girl born of this marriage in 1782 was sickly
and delicate ugly of feature with a nose even then large enough to be
absurd her fathers nose in a face as thin as a mans wrist She had
nothing of what her parents vanity would have liked her to have After
making a fiasco on the piano at the age of five at a concert given by
her mother in her salon she was relegated to the society of the
servants Except for a moment in the morning she never went near her
