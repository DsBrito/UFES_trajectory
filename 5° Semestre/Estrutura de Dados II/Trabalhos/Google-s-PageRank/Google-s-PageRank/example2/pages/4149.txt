going out in the morning he said to some of his officers Gentlemen let
us look to ourselves for it was this day three years that so many brave
Englishmen were knocked on the head by the Moores when Fines made his
sally out  Here till almost night and then home with Sir J Minnes by
coach and so to my office a while and home to supper and bed being now
in constant pain in my back but whether it be only wind or what it is the
Lord knows but I fear the worst
3rd  Up still in a constant pain in my back which much afflicts me with
fear of the consequence of it  All the morning at the office we sat at
the office extraordinary upon the business of our stores but Lord  what
a pitiful account the Surveyor makes of it grieves my heart This morning
before I came out I made a bargain with Captain Taylor for a ship for the
Commissioners for Tangier wherein I hope to get L40 or L50 To the
Change and thence home and dined and then by coach to White Hall
sending my wife to Mrs Hunts  At the Committee for Tangier all the
afternoon where a sad consideration to see things of so great weight
managed in so confused a manner as it is so as I would not have the
buying of an acre of land bought by the Duke of York and Mr Coventry for
ought I see being the only two that do anything like men Prince Rupert
do nothing but swear and laugh a little with an oathe or two and thats
all he do  Thence called my wife and home and I late at my office and
so home to supper and to bed pleased at my hopes of gains by todays
work but very sad to think of the state of my health
4th  Up and to St Jamess by coach after a good deal of talk before I
went forth with J Noble who tells me that he will secure us against
Cave that though he knows and can prove it yet nobody else can prove
it to be Toms child that the bond was made by one Hudson a scrivener
next to the Fountaine taverne in the Old Bayly that the children were
born and christened and entered in the parishbook of St Sepulchres
by the name of Anne and Elizabeth Taylor and he will give us security
against Cave if we pay him the money  And then up to the Duke and was
with him giving him an account how matters go and of the necessity there
is of a power to presse seamen without which we cannot really raise men
for this fleete of twelve sayle besides that it will assert the Kings
power of pressing which at present is somewhat doubted and will make the
Dutch believe that we are in earnest  Thence by water to the office
where we sat till almost two oclock  This morning Captain Ferrer came to
the office to tell me that my Lord hath given him a promise of Youngs
place in the Wardrobe and hearing that I pretend a promise to it he comes
to ask my consent which I denied him and told him my Lord may do what he
pleases with his promise to me but my fathers condition is not so as
that I should let it go if my Lord will stand to his word and so I sent
him going myself being troubled a little at it  After office I with Mr
Coventry by water to St Jamess and dined with him and had excellent
discourse from him  So to the Committee for Tangier all afternoon where
still the same confused doings and my Lord FitzHarding now added to the
Committee which will signify much  It grieves me to see how brokenly
things are ordered  So by coach home and at my office late and so to
supper and to bed my body by plenty of breaking of wind being just now
pretty well again having had a constant akeing in my back these 5 or 6
days  Mr Coventry discoursing this noon about Sir W Batten what a sad
fellow he is told me how the King told him the other day how Sir W
Batten being in the ship with him and Prince Rupert when they expected to
fight with Warwick did walk up and down sweating with a napkin under his
throat to dry up his sweat and that Prince Rupert being a most jealous
man and particularly of Batten do walk up and down swearing bloodily to
the King that Batten had a mind to betray them today and that the
napkin was a signal but by God says he if things go ill the first
thing I will do is to shoot him  He discoursed largely and bravely to me
concerning the different sort of valours the active and passive valour
For the latter he brought as an instance General Blake who in the
defending of Taunton and Lime for the Parliament did through his stubborn
sort of valour defend it the most opiniastrement that ever any man did
any thing and yet never was the man that ever made any attaque by land or
sea but rather avoyded it on all even fair occasions  On the other
side Prince Rupert the boldest attaquer in the world for personal
courage and yet in the defending of Bristol no man ever did anything
worse he wanting the patience and seasoned head to consult and advise for
defence and to bear with the evils of a siege  The like he says is said
of my Lord Tiviott who was the boldest adventurer of his person in the
world and from a mean man in few years was come to this greatness of
command and repute only by the death of all his officers he many times
having the luck of being the only survivor of them all by venturing upon
services for the King of France that nobody else would and yet no man
upon a defence he being all fury and no judgment in a fight  He tells me
above all of the Duke of Yorke that he is more himself and more of
judgement is at hand in him in the middle of a desperate service than at
other times as appeared in the business of Dunkirke wherein no man ever
did braver things or was in hotter service in the close of that day
being surrounded with enemies and then contrary to the advice of all
about him his counsel carried himself and the rest through them safe by
advising that he might make his passage with but a dozen with him For
says he the enemy cannot move after me so fast with a great body and
with a small one we shall be enough to deal with them and though he is a
man naturally martiall to the highest degree yet a man that never in his
life talks one word of himself or service of his owne but only that he
saw such or such a thing and lays it down for a maxime that a Hector can
have no courage  He told me also as a great instance of some men that
the Prince of Condos excellence is that there not being a more furious
man in the world danger in fight never disturbs him more than just to
make him civill and to command in words of great obligation to his
officers and men but without any the least disturbance in his judgment or
spirit
5th Lords day  About one in the morning I was knocked up by my mayds
to come to my wife who is very ill  I rose and from some cold she got
today or from something else she is taken with great gripings a
looseness and vomiting  I lay a while by her upon the bed she being in
great pain poor wretch but that being a little over I to bed again and
lay and then up and to my office all the morning setting matters to
rights in some accounts and papers and then to dinner whither Mr
Shepley late come to town came to me and after dinner and some pleasant
discourse he went his way being to go out of town to Huntington again
tomorrow  So all the afternoon with my wife discoursing and talking and
in the evening to my office doing business and then home to supper and to
bed
6th  Up and found my wife very ill again which troubles me but I was
forced to go forth  So by water with Mr Gauden and others to see a ship
hired by me for the Commissioners of Tangier and to give order therein
So back to the office and by coach with Mr Gauden to White Hall and
there to my Lord Sandwich and here I met Mr Townsend very opportunely
and Captain Ferrer and after some discourse we did accommodate the
business of the Wardrobe place that he shall have the reversion if he
will take it out by giving a covenant that if Mr Young dyes before my
father my father shall have the benefit of it for his life  So home and
thence by water to Deptford and there found our Trinity Brethren come
from their election to church where Dr Britton made methought an
indifferent sermon touching the decency that we ought to observe in Gods
house the church but yet to see how ridiculously some men will carry
themselves  Sir W Batten did at open table anon in the name of the whole
Society desire him to print his sermon as if the Doctor could think that
they were fit judges of a good sermon  Then by barge with Sir W Batten
to Trinity House  It seems they have with much ado carried it for Sir G
Carteret against Captain Harrison poor man who by succession ought to
have been it and most hands were for him but only they were forced to
fright the younger Brethren by requiring them to set their hands which is
an ill course and then Sir G Carteret carryed it  Here was at dinner my
Lord Sandwich Mr Coventry my Lord Craven and others A great dinner
and good company  Mr Prin also who would not drink any health no not
the Kings but sat down with his hat on all the while
William Prynne had published in 1628 a small book against the
drinking of healths entitled Healthes Sicknesse or a
compendious and briefe Discourse prouing the Drinking and Pledging
of Healthes to be sinfull and utterly unlawfull unto Christians
wherein all those ordinary objections excuses or pretences
which are made to justifie extenuate or excuse the drinking or
pledging of Healthes are likewise cleared and answered  The
pamphlet was dedicated to Charles I as more interessed in the
theame and subject of this compendious discourse then any other that
I know and because your Majestie of all other persons within your
owne dominions are most dishonoured prejudiced and abused by
these Healthes
but nobody took notice of it to him at all but in discourse with the
Doctor he did declare himself that he ever was and has expressed himself
in all his books for mixt communion against the Presbyterian examination
Thence after dinner by water my Lord Sandwich and all us Tangier men
where at the Committee busy till night with great confusion and then by
coach home with this content however that I find myself every day
become more and more known and shall one day hope to have benefit by it
I found my wife a little better  A little to my office then home to
supper and to bed
7th  Up and to the office having by my going by water without any thing
upon my legs yesterday got some pain upon me again where all the
morning  At noon a little to the Change and thence home to dinner my
wife being ill still in bed  Thence to the office where busy all the
afternoon till 9 at night and so home to my wife to supper and to bed
8th  All day before dinner with Creed talking of many things among
others of my Lords going so often to Chelsy and he without my speaking
much do tell me that his daughters do perceive all and do hate the
place and the young woman there Mrs Betty Becke for my Lord who sent
them thither only for a disguise for his going thither will come under
pretence to see them and pack them out of doors to the Parke and stay
behind with her but now the young ladies are gone to their mother to
Kensington  To dinner and after dinner till 10 at night in my study
writing of my old broken office notes in shorthand all in one book till
my eyes did ake ready to drop out  So home to supper and to bed
9th  Up and at my office all the morning  At noon dined at home Mr
Hunt and his kinswoman wife in the country after dinner I to the
office where we sat all the afternoon  Then at night by coach to attend
the Duke of Albemarle about the Tangier ship  Coming back my wife spied
me going home by coach from Mr Hunts with whom she hath gained much in
discourse today concerning W Howes discourse of me to him  That he was
the man that got me to be secretary to my Lord and all that I have
thereby and that for all this I never did give him 6d in my life Which
makes me wonder that this rogue dare talk after this manner and I think
all the world is grown false  But I hope I shall make good use of it  So
home to supper and to bed my eyes aching mightily since last night
10th  Up and by water to White Hall and there to a Committee of Tangier
and had occasion to see how my Lord AshworthLord Ashworth is probably a
miswriting for Lord Ashley afterwards Earl of Shaftesburydeports
himself which is very fine indeed and it joys my heart to see that there
is any body looks so near into the Kings business as I perceive he do in
this business of my Lord Peterboroughs accounts Thence into the Parke
and met and walked with Captain Sylas Taylor my old acquaintance while I
was of the Exchequer and Dr Whore talking of musique and particularly
of Mr Berckenshaws way which Taylor magnifies mightily and perhaps but
what it deserves but not so easily to be understood as he and others make
of it  Thence home by water and after dinner abroad to buy several
things as a map and powder and other small things and so home to my
office and in the evening with Captain Taylor by water to our Tangier
ship and so home well pleased having received L26 profit today of my
bargain for this ship which comforts me mightily though I confess my
heart what with my being out of order as to my health and the fear I
have of the money my Lord oweth me and I stand indebted to him in is much
cast down of late  In the evening home to supper and to bed
11th  Up and to the office where we sat all the morning where some
discourse arose from Sir G Carteret and Mr Coventry which gives me
occasion to think that something like a war is expected now indeed though
upon the Change afterwards I hear too that an Embassador is landed from
Holland and one from their East India Company to treat with ours about
the wrongs we pretend to  Mr Creed dined with me and thence after
dinner by coach with my wife only to take the ayre it being very warm and
pleasant to Bowe and Old Ford and thence to Hackney  There light and
played at shuffleboard eat cream and good churies and so with good
refreshment home  Then to my office vexed with Captain Taylor about the
delay of carrying down the ship hired by me for Tangier and late about
that and other things at the office  So home to supper and to bed
12th Lords day  All the morning in my chamber consulting my lesson of
ship building and at noon Mr Creed by appointment came and dined with
us and sat talking all the afternoon till about church time my wife and
I began our great dispute about going to Griffins childs christening
where I was to have been godfather but Sir J Minnes refusing he wanted
an equal for me and my Lady Batten and so sought for other  Then the
question was whether my wife should go and she having dressed herself on
purpose was very angry and began to talk openly of my keeping her within
doors before Creed which vexed me to the guts but I had the discretion
to keep myself without passion and so resolved at last not to go but to
go down by water which we did by H Russella watermanto the
Halfway house and there eat and drank and upon a very small occasion
had a difference again broke out where without any the least cause she
had the cunning to cry a great while and talk and blubber which made me
mighty angry in mind but said nothing to provoke her because Creed was
there but walked home being troubled in my mind also about the knavery
and neglect of Captain Fudge and Taylor who were to have had their ship
for Tangier ready by Thursday last and now the men by a mistake are come
on board and not any master or man or boy of the ships company on board
with them when we came by her side this afternoon and also received a
letter from Mr Coventry this day in complaint of it  We came home and
after supper Creed went home and I to bed  My wife made great means to
be friends coming to my bedside and doing all things to please me and at
last I could not hold out but seemed pleased and so parted and I with
much ado to sleep but was easily wakened by extraordinary great rain and
my mind troubled the more to think what the soldiers would do on board
tonight in all this weather
13th  So up at 5 oclock and with Captain Taylor on board her at
Deptford and found all out of order only the soldiers civil and Sir
Arthur Bassett a civil person  I rated at Captain Taylor whom contrary
to my expectation I found a lying and a very stupid blundering fellow
good for nothing and yet we talk of him in the Navy as if he had been an
excellent officer but I find him a lying knave and of no judgment or
dispatch at all  After finding the condition of the ship no master not
above four men and many ships provisions sayls and other things
wanting I went back and called upon Fudge whom I found like a lying
rogue unready to go on board but I did so jeer him that I made him get
every thing ready and left Taylor and H Russell to quicken him and so
away and I by water on to White Hall where I met his Royal Highnesse at a
Tangier Committee about this very thing and did there satisfy him how
things are at which all was pacified without any trouble and I hope may
end well but I confess I am at a real trouble for fear the rogue should
not do his work and I come to shame and losse of the money I did hope
justly to have got by it  Thence walked with Mr Coventry to St Jamess
and there spent by his desire the whole morning reading of some old Navy
books given him of old Sir John Cookes by the Archbishop of Canterbury
that now is wherein the order that was observed in the Navy then above
what it is now is very observable and fine things we did observe in our
reading  Anon to dinner after dinner to discourse of the business of the
Dutch warr wherein he tells me the Dutch do in every particular which
are but few and small things that we can demand of them whatever cry we
unjustly make do seem to offer at an accommodation for they do owne that
it is not for their profit to have warr with England  We did also talk of
a History of the Navy of England how fit it were to be writ and he did
say that it hath been in his mind to propose to me the writing of the
History of the late Dutch warr which I am glad to hear it being a thing
I much desire and sorts mightily with my genius and if well done may
recommend me much  So he says he will get me an order for making of
searches to all records c in order thereto and I shall take great
delight in doing of it  Thence by water down to the Tower and thither
sent for Mr Creed to my house where he promised to be and he and I down
to the ship and find all things in pretty good order and I hope will end
to my mind  Thence having a gaily down to Greenwich and there saw the
Kings works which are great adoing there and so to the Cherry Garden
and so carried some cherries home and after supper to bed my wife lying
with me which from my not being thoroughly well nor she we have not
done above once these two or three weeks
14th  Up and to the office where we sat all the morning and had great
conflict about the flags again and am vexed methought to see my Lord
Berkely not satisfied with what I said but however I stop the Kings
being abused by the flag makers for the present  I do not know how it may
end but I will do my best to preserve it  So home to dinner and after
dinner by coach to Kensington  In the way overtaking Mr Laxton the
apothecary with his wife and daughters very fine young lasses in a
coach and so both of us to my Lady Sandwich who hath lain this fortnight
here at Deane Hodgess  Much company came hither today my Lady
Carteret c Sir William Wheeler and his lady and above all Mr
Becke of Chelsy and wife and daughter my Lords mistress and one that
hath not one good feature in her face and yet is a fine lady of a fine
taille and very well carriaged and mighty discreet  I took all the
occasion I could to discourse with the young ladies in her company to give
occasion to her to talk which now and then she did and that mighty
finely and is I perceive a woman of such an ayre as I wonder the less
at my Lords favour to her and I dare warrant him she hath brains enough
to entangle him  Two or three houres we were in her company going into
Sir H Finches garden and seeing the fountayne and singing there with
the ladies and a mighty fine cool place it is with a great laver of
water in the middle and the bravest place for musique I ever heard After
much mirthe discoursing to the ladies in defence of the city against the
country or court and giving them occasion to invite themselves tomorrow
to me to dinner to my venison pasty I got their mothers leave and so
good night very well pleased with my days work and above all that I
have seen my Lords mistresse  So home to supper and a little at my
office and to bed
15th  Up and by appointment with Captain Witham the Captain that brought
the newes of the disaster at Tangier where my Lord Tiviott was slain and
Mr Tooker to Beares Quay and there saw and more afterward at the several
grannarys several parcels of oates and strange it is to hear how it will
heat itself if laid up green and not often turned  We came not to any
agreement but did cheapen several parcels and thence away promising to
send again to them  So to the Victualling office and then home  And in
our garden I got Captain Witham to tell me the whole story of my Lord
Tiviotts misfortune for he was upon the guard with his horse neare the
towne when at a distance he saw the enemy appear upon a hill a mile and
a half off and made up to them and with much ado escaped himself but
what became of my Lord he neither knows nor thinks that any body but the
enemy can tell  Our losse was about four hundred  But he tells me that
the greater wonder is that my Lord Tiviott met no sooner with such a
disaster for every day he did commit himself to more probable danger than
this for now he had the assurance of all his scouts that there was no
enemy thereabouts whereas he used every day to go out with two or three
with him to make his discoveries in greater danger and yet the man that
could not endure to have anybody else to go a step out of order to
endanger himself  He concludes him to be the man of the hardest fate to
lose so much honour at one blow that ever was  His relation being done he
parted and so I home to look after things for dinner  And anon at noon
comes Mr Creed by chance and by and by the three young ladiesLord
Sandwichs daughtersand very merry we were with our pasty very well
baked and a good dish of roasted chickens pease lobsters strawberries
And after dinner to cards and about five oclock by water down to
Greenwich and up to the top of the hill and there played upon the ground
at cards  And so to the Cherry Garden and then by water singing finely
to the Bridge and there landed and so took boat again and to Somersett
House  And by this time the tide being against us it was past ten of
the clock and such a troublesome passage in regard of my Lady Paulinas
fearfullness that in all my life I never did see any poor wretch in that
condition  Being come hither there waited for them their coach but it
being so late I doubted what to do how to get them home  After half an
hours stay in the street I sent my wife home by coach with Mr Creeds
boy and myself and Creed in the coach home with them  But Lord the
fear that my Lady Paulina was in every step of the way and indeed at this
time of the night it was no safe thing to go that road so that I was even
afeard myself though I appeared otherwiseWe came safe however to
their house where all were abed we knocked them up my Lady and all the
family being in bed  So put them into doors and leaving them with the
mayds bade them good night and then into the towne Creed and I it
being about twelve oclock and past and to several houses inns but
could get no lodging all being in bed  At the last house at last we
found some people drinking and roaring and there got in and after
drinking got an ill bed where
16th  I lay in my drawers and stockings and wastecoate till five of the
clock and so up and being well pleased with our frolique walked to
Knightsbridge and there eat a messe of creame and so to St Jamess and
there walked a little and so I to White Hall and took coach and found
my wife well got home last night and now in bed  So I to the office
where all the morning and at noon to the Change so home and to my
office where Mr Ackworth came to me though he knows himself and I know
him to be a very knave yet he came to me to discover the knavery of
other people like the most honest man in the world  However good use I
shall make of his discourse for in this he is much in the right  He
being gone I to the Change Mr Creed with me after we had been by water
to see a vessell we have hired to carry more soldiers to Tangier and also
visited a rope ground wherein I learnt several useful things The talk
upon the Change is that De Ruyter is dead with fifty men of his own
ship of the plague at Cales that the Holland Embassador here do
endeavour to sweeten us with fair words and things likely to be
peaceable  Home after I had spoke with my cozen Richard Pepys upon the
Change about supplying us with bewpers from Norwich which I should be
glad of if cheap  So home to supper and bed
17th  Up and to my office where I dispatched much business and then
down by water to Woolwich to make a discovery of a cheate providing for us
in the working of some of our own ground Tows into new cordage to be sold
to us for Riga cordage  Thence to Mr Falconers where I met Sir W
Batten and Lady and Captain Tinker and there dined with them and so to
the Dockyarde and to Deptford by water and there very long informing
myself in the business of flags and bewpers and other things and so home
late being weary and full of good information today but I perceive the
corruptions of the Navy are of so many kinds that it is endless to look
after them especially while such a one as Sir W Batten discourages every
man that is honest  So home to my office there very late and then to
supper and to bed mightily troubled in my mind to hear how Sir W Batten
and Sir J Minnes do labour all they can to abuse or enable others to
abuse the King
18th  From morning till 11 at night only a little at dinner at home at
my office very busy setting many businesses in order to my great trouble
but great content in the end  So home to supper and to bed Strange to
see how pert Sir W Pen is today newly come from Portsmouth with his head
full of great reports of his service and the state of the ships there
When that is over he will be just as another man again or worse  But I
wonder whence Mr Coventry should take all this care for him to send for
him up only to look after his Irish business with my Lord Ormond and to
get the Dukes leave for him to come with so much officiousness when I am
sure he knows him as well as I do as to his little service he do
19th Lords day  Up and all the morning and afternoon only at dinner
at home at my office doing many businesses for want of time on the week
days  In the afternoon the greatest shower of rain of a sudden and the
greatest and most continued thunder that ever I heard I think in my life
In the evening home to my wife and there talked seriously of several of
our family concernments and among others of bringing Pall out of the
country to us here to try to put her off which I am very desirous and my
wife also of  So to supper prayers which I have of late too much
omitted  So to bed
20th  It having been a very cold night last night I had got some cold
and so in pain by wind and a sure precursor of pain is sudden letting off
farts and when that stops then my passages stop and my pain begins Up
and did several businesses and so with my wife by water to White Hall
she to her fathers I to the Duke where we did our usual business  And
among other discourse of the Dutch he was merrily saying how they print
that Prince Rupert Duke of Albemarle and my Lord Sandwich are to be
Generalls and soon after is to follow them Vieux Pen and so the Duke
called him in mirth Old Pen  They have it seems lately wrote to the
King to assure him that their settingout ships were only to defend their
fishingtrade and to stay near home not to annoy the Kings subjects
and to desire that he would do the like with his ships which the King
laughs at but yet is troubled they should think him such a child to
suffer them to bring home their fish and East India Companys ships and
then they will not care a fart for us  Thence to Westminster Hall it
being term time meeting Mr Dickering he tells me how my Lady last week
went to see Mrs Becke the mother and by and by the daughter came in
but that my Lady do say herself as he says that she knew not for what
reason for she never knew they had a daughter which I do not believe
She was troubled and her heart did rise as soon as she appeared and
seems the most ugly woman that ever she saw  This if true were strange
but I believe it is not  Thence to my Lords lodgings and were merry
with the young ladies who make a great story of their appearing before
their mother the morning after we carried them the last week home so
late and that their mother took it very well at least without any anger
Here I heard how the rich widow my Lady Gold is married to one Neale
after he had received a box on the eare by her brother who was there a
sentinel in behalf of some courtier at the door but made him draw and
wounded him  She called Neale up to her and sent for a priest married
presently and went to bed  The brother sent to the Court and had a
serjeant sent for Neale but Neale sent for him up to be seen in bed and
she owned him for her husband and so all is past  It seems Sir H Bennet
did look after her  My Lady very pleasant  After dinner came in Sir
Thomas Crew and Mr Sidney lately come from France who is growne a
little and a pretty youth he is but not so improved as they did give him
out to be but like a child still But yet I can perceive he hath good
parts and good inclinations  Thence with Creed who dined here to
Westminster to find out Mr Hawly and did but he did not accept of my
offer of his being steward to my Lord at sea  Thence alone to several
places about my law businesses and with good success at last I to Mr
Townsend at the Wardrobe and received kind words from him to be true to
me against Captain Ferrers his endeavours to get the place from my father
as my Lord hath promised him Here met Will Howe and he went forth with
me and by water back to White Hall to wait on my Lord who is come back
from Hinchinbroke where he has been about 4 or 5 days  But I was never
more vexed to see how an overofficious visitt is received for he
received me with as little concernment as in the middle of his discontent
and a fool I am to be of so servile a humour and vexed with that
consideration I took coach home and could not get it off my mind all
night  To supper and to bed my wife finding fault with Besse for her
calling upon Jane that lived with us and there heard Mrs Harper and her
talk ill of us and not told us of it  With which I was also vexed and
told her soundly of it till she cried poor wench and I hope without
dissimulation and yet I cannot tell however I was glad to see in what
manner she received it and so to sleep
21st  Being weary yesterday with walking I sleep long and at last up and
to the office where all the morning  At home to dinner Mr Deane with
me  After dinner I to White Hall setting down my wife by the way to a
Committee of Tangier where the Duke of Yorke I perceive do attend the
business very well much better than any man there or most of them and my
mind eased of some trouble I lay under for fear of his thinking ill of
me from the bad successe in the setting forth of these crew men to
Tangier  Thence with Mr Creed and walked in the Parke and so to the
New Exchange meeting Mr Moore and he with us  I shewed him no friendly
look but he took no notice to me of the Wardrobe business which vexes
me  I perceive by him my Lords business of his family and estate goes
very ill and runs in debt mightily  I would to God I were clear of it
both as to my owne money and the bond of L1000 which I stand debtor for
him in to my cozen Thomas Pepys  Thence by coach home and to my office a
little and so to supper and to bed
22nd  Up and I found Mr Creed below who staid with me a while and then
I to business all the morning  At noon to the Change and Coffeehouse
where great talke of the Dutch preparing of sixty sayle of ships The
plague grows mightily among them both at sea and land  From the Change
to dinner to Trinity House with Sir W Rider and Cutler where a very good
dinner  Here Sir G Ascue dined also who I perceive desires to make
himself known among the seamen  Thence home there coming to me my Lord
Peterboroughs Sollicitor with a letter from him to desire present
dispatch in his business of freight and promises me L50 which is good
newes and I hope to do his business readily for him  This much rejoiced
me  All the afternoon at his business and late at night comes the
Sollicitor again and I with him at 9 oclock to Mr Povys and there
acquainted him with the business  The money he wont pay without warrant
but that will be got done in a few days  So home by coach and to bed
23rd  Up and to the office and there we sat all the morning  So to the
Change and then home to dinner and to my office where till 10 at night
very busy and so home to supper and to bed  My cozen Thomas Pepys was
with me yesterday and I took occasion to speak to him about the bond I
stand bound for my Lord Sandwich to him in L1000  I did very plainly
obliging him to secrecy tell him how the matter stands yet with all duty
to my Lord my resolution to be bound for whatever he desires me for him
yet that I would be glad he had any other security I perceive by Mr
Moore today that he hath been with my Lord and my Lord how he takes it I
know not but he is looking after other security and I am mighty glad of
it  W Howe was with me this afternoon to desire some things to be got
ready for my Lord against his going down to his ship which will be soon
for it seems the King and both the Queenes intend to visit him  The Lord
knows how my Lord will get out of this charge for Mr Moore tells me
today that he is L10000 in debt and this will with many other things
that daily will grow upon him while he minds his pleasure as he do set
him further backward  But it was pretty this afternoon to hear W Howe
mince the matter and say that he do believe that my Lord is in debt L2000
