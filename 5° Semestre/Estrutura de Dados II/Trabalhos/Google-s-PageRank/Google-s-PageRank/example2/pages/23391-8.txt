Chapter One
STEERING OF NEW YORK
Hooeeowohme
It was half a sob half a laugh and half sobbing half laughing the
young man stopped his horse on the crest of the Tigmore Hills in the
Ozark Uplift raised in his stirrups and looked the country through and
through as though he must see into its very heart In the brilliant
midafternoon light the Southwest unrolled below him and around him in a
ragged bigness and an unconquered loneliness As far as eye could reach
tumbled the knobs the flats the waste weedy places the gullies the
rockpitted sweeps of tableland and the timbered hills of the Uplift
The buffalo grass trembled across the lowlands in long shaking billows
that had all the effect of scared flight From the base of the Tigmores
a line of river bottom stretched westward and beyond the bottom curved
a pale quiet river In the distance wraiths of blue smoke falteringly
bespoke the presence of people and cabins on a cleared hill an object
that might be horse or dog or man was silhouetted small and vague and
in the farthest west the hoister of a deserted zinc mine cut up against
the sky a little lonely way The near and dominant things were
constantly those tremulous fleeing billows of grass the straight
strong trees the sullen rocks the silent shivering water
Hooeeow
It was too vast too urgent Waiting ready it lay there aggressively
like a challenge As the young man faced it it claimed him forcing
back his past life his old habits his old haunts into the realm of
myth and moonshine His old habits His old haunts They hung aloof in
his consciousness shadow pictures colourless and remote That
zestful young life at New Haven the swift years of it the fine last
day of it Yale honours upon him his enthusiasms cutting away into the
future his big shoulders squared his face set toward great things the
righting of wrongs grand reforms the careers of nations A bachelor
hotel a club whose windows looked out on the avenue an office where
Carington and he had pretended to work down on Nassau Street
drawingrooms where Carington and he had pretended to be in love on
various streets the whole gay meaningless panorama of his life as a
homeless unplaced New York sojourner who had considered that he had
too much money to be anything seriously and too little money to do
anything effectively Then another picture jerking mazy a study in
kinematicsCrazy Monday on the Street Carington and he swept along
in that days whirlwind of speculation A blank in the panorama while
he got used to things and thought things out Then a wintry twilight
at the club Carington and he by the window talking it over looking
out upon the drifted light of the city loving the city in the way of
New Yorkers Then Caringtons voice saying Bruce Bruce m son Why
dont you try Missouri Saying it with that in his voice to indicate
that there was nothing else left to try Then the long thoughtful talk
Carington and he still by the window while he showed Carington how
little chance he had even in Missouri then Caringtons stronghearted
insistence that in view of the agitation over the ore discoveries at
Joplin he go on out there and prospect and then Caringtons
foolishly irrelevant heelpiece Miss Gossamer sails for Europe
Saturday and the sudden appeal of the notion to go out there its
sharp strikingin Carington and he taking counsel with some of the
other fellows in his rooms later on all the deep voices roaring at
once all the boys insulting him at once belittling his cigars saying
sharp things about his pictures that being their way of showing him
that they were badly broken up over his leaving them all their eyes
shining interest in him and hope for him and even envy of him as the
young man who was going out West while the great soft fluff of smoke
in the room made the past a dream and the present an illusion and the
future a phantasm Then the long journey overland the little impetus
toward the new life flickering drearily while he gripped up his heart
for any fate growing quieter and quieter but more and more determined
to take Missouri as she came Then Missouri herself the stop at St
Louis the dip into the State southwestward toward the lead and zinc
country and his own debatable land goodbye to the railroad by team
in company with other prospectors through the sang hills up and down
stony ridges along vast cattle ranges And now here quite alone
twenty miles from the railroad Missouri on all sides of him
closetimbered rockribbed gulchbroken mortally lonely billowing
around him over him possessing him
That sense of being possessed by Missouri committed to her had grown
upon him intolerably all day All day he had been fighting it and
resenting it At various points along the rocky ridge road he had come
upon hill cabins and hill people and facing them his fight and his
resentment had been momentarily vicious
Gudday stranger the people had called from the porches of the hill
cabins Hikin over the Ridge
Yes friend Steering had called back and had then projected his
unfailing anxious question Can you tell me how far it is to
Poetical
At that the people from the porches had got up and come across the baked
weeds of the cabin yard Assembled at the stileblock in front of him
the people invariably lined up as a long gaunt farmer a thin
flatchested woman a troop of dusty children and a yellow dog
Yass I cand tell you Its six sights and a right smart chanst fm
here to Poetical stranger the long gaunt farmer had invariably
drawled with more accommodation than information
Six sightssix sights and a right what what
Wy the Missourian had explained forbearingly blinking toward the
sun and waving his loosely jointed arms westward its
thisawayyoull git sight of Poetical fm six hills an whend you
git to the bottom of the sixt hill theys a right smart chanst you
wont be to Poetical evum yit awhile You cand see far in this air Its
some mild fm here to Poetical an sharp ridin at that
Each time that Steering had heard that little varied in phraseology
save for the number of sights according to his progress he had felt
so dismal and looked so dismal that each time the native before him
had added quickly Better git off an spin the night with us Aint got
much but what we gots yourn
Each time the house beyond the stileblock had looked miserably
uninvitinga plough on the front porch harness on the porch posts
all around the house the yard litter of cheap farm life a brokendown
harrow brokenbacked furniture straw cornshucks ghosts of past
winters and past summers on the farm that had shuffled out there and
died there each time the cleared patches beyond the house had looked
lean each time the native had been sallow and toilworn but each time
that welcome word had been a finely perfect thing good to hear
Steering had noticed that in declining each invitation he had suddenly
stopped short in his inner fight and resentment and assumed his best
manner as though his finest and highest courtesy had responded
instinctively to something in kind
Idling on for a more expansive moment at each cabin door the
conversation had usually shaped itself like this
Two has already rid over the Ridge todayOld Bernique and the
trampboy Old Bernique hes on the trail agin The trampboy hes kim
along so far with Old Bernique In saying this or something very like
it the hill farmer who spoke had always seemed to want it definitely
understood that the neighbourhood had its excitements and seemed to
argue that if the stranger knew anything he must know Old Bernique and
the trampboy Proceeding leisurely and reflectively as though he had
decided in his own mind how to classify the stranger the farmer had
generally added Lots of prospectors ride by nowadays They head in to
the relroad fm hereyou know you aint agoin to ketch the relroad at
Poetical
Yes I know but when I left my friends at Bessietown yesterday I was
hoping I could make it all the way across country to Canaan before
tonight
Oh you goin on to Canaan
Yes going on to Canaan Each time the words had echoed through
Steerings head with an oldtime promise in a mocking refrain Going on
to Canaan Going on to Canaan
Immediately the hill tribe had eyed him with renewed interest Going on
to Canaan the farmer at their head had repeated an impressive esteem
in his treatment of the word Canaan Gret taown Canaan You strike
the relroad tha all righty Dogoned ef thaint abaout evthing tha
Got the cotehaouse an all the relroad an allMiss Sally Madeira
Mist Crit Madeiras daughter she lives tha
It had gone like that every time Not once in the last twenty miles had
Steering exchanged a word with man or woman without this sort of
reference to Canaan and collaterally to Miss Sally Madeira Miss
Sally he had perceived early excited in the hillfarm people a species
of awe as though she were on a par with the circus thaumaturgic
almost too good to be true
The court house the railroad and Miss Sally he had finally learned
to murmur in order to meet the demands of the situation
Yass oh yass The farmer had given his head a dogged twist and
looked as though he were cognisant of the fact that in certain essential
particulars Canaan did not have to yield an inch of her title to
equality with the biggest and best anywhere Yass saouthwest
Mizzourahs hard to beat in spots thaint no State in the Union quite
like her Shes different he had said rocking on his heels his chest
lifting
I think you must be right about that Steering had answered every
time with profounder emphasis
Off here alone on the ridge road now Missouris unspeakable difference
was coming over him in great submerging waves Though he tried bravely
to face the State and have it out with her he couldnt do it
Missouri he said at last to himself and to her confidentially Id
like to cry Id give five hundred plunkerinos if I might be allowed to
cry Then he flicked his ridingcrop over his leg in a devilishly
nonchalant way and rode straight forward
The road went on interminably its dustwhite line with the rocky ridge
through the middle dipping and rising and getting nowhere The horse
grew nervous and shied repeatedly from sheer loneliness The road
entered a wood Deep in its leafy fastness wild steers heard the beat of
the horses hoofs laid back their ears and galloped into safer depths
bellowing with alarm Steering gave up as helplessly homesick as a
baby his head dropped forward on his chest in a settled melancholy
from which he did not rouse until he had cleared the timber and then
only because he saw a horseman down the ridge road ahead of him What
instantly attracted Steerings attention was the mans back It was a
small but proud back It had none of the hill stoop It was erect
sinewy soldierly Steering was so lonely that he would have welcomed
companionship with a chipmunk The chance of companionship with a man
who had an interesting back grew luminous He urged his horse forward
eagerly almost hysterically glad of his opportunity
Goodafternoon he called having recourse to his welltried form of
greeting Can you tell me how far it is to Poetical
The man addressed half turned disclosing a thin and delicate face to
Steering Then he reined his horse in gently Goodevening sair Is it
that you inquire to Poetical It is a vair long five miles fm here
sair
Steering rode up beside the man more and more pleased regarding and
analysing The mans hickory shirt his warped boots his blue jean
trousers his heavy buskins were mean and earthstained but inherent in
the quality of his low musical voice and courteous manner was an
intangible suggestion of something different some bigger and happier
past to which go where he would and clothe himself as he might voice
and manner had remained true
I wonder said Steering almost sighing if you will mind a little of
my company The road is terribly lonely sir The country is terribly
lonely in fact
Yes sair a trrue word that It is lonely But sair what will you
of this particulaire portion It is vair yong in the Tigmores It
cannot be populate in a day a year You sair come from the East
hein Sair relativement effort against effort they have not done as
much in the East in feefty years as we have done in the Southwest in
twentybelieve that sair It was that same feeling for the State
that quick leaping passion of nativity that Steering had thus far found
in every Missourian with whom he had come in contact
You are a Missourian I see said Steering to keep his companion
talking along the line of this enlivening enthusiasm
Indeed sair yes From that Saint LouisFrancois Placide DeLassus
Bernique at your service
Thank you My name is Steering from New York if you please but very
deeply interested in Missouri just now sir
From that on they made easy progress into acquaintance Bernique proved
talkative full of anecdotes about Missouris past and full of belief
in her future In his rich loquacity he roamed the history of the State
painstakingly for the edification of Steering as one who stood at
Missouris gates inquiring of her true inwardness He told Missouris
history back to Spain and France forward to unspeakable splendour He
was intelligent naive unusual Steering responsive to the attraction
that was by and by to hold them strongly together listened delightedly
Yessairthrough Berniques speech ran a reminiscence of his native
tongue faint sweet fleeting like the thought of homeyessair it
is I know the fashion in the eastern States to considaire all the West
as vair yong countree and it is trrue sair that you par example
have come upon the most yong part of thees grreat State of Missouri
but it is to be remembaire that this Missouri is not all rocks and wood
uncultivate standing toward the future but that her story date back
to a remoter period and a fuller and finer civilisation in that day
when France and Spain held sway over the province of Louisiana than
does the story of many of the eastern States who hold this countree new
raw uncivilise I myselfcontinued the speaker spreading out one
slender hand with an exquisite gracehave grrown up in this State
of Missouri at that St Louis with the most profound convincement
aftaire much travel and observation that for elegance we have in that
city the most to it belong people in the United States of America
yessair
Ah well admitted Steering borne along rapidly on the vehement
current of Berniques ardour with your sort of spirit in the people of
Missouri whatever she was and whatever she is can be but a mighty
promise of what she will become
Ah there you have it the note interrupted Francois Placide DeLassus
Bernique eagerly What she will become That is the grrand thought
sair I who say it have preserve my belief in what she will become
through the discouragement terrible I who speak have prospec this
land from end to end I know her largesse Believe me sair the
trreasures that were sought by the Castilian knights of old through
all thees parts are indeed to be found herenot the white silvaire of
Castilian dreams but iron Coppaire Lead Zinc
I suppose ventured Steering that it would be foolish to hope for
deposits in this part of the State similar to the deposits about Joplin
and all through the thirtymile stretch
Pouf Old Bernique made one of his pretty gestures but said nothing
You have went on Steering you have to the west here the Canaan
Tigmores Mr Bernique
Eh Yessair the Canaan Tigmores repeated old Bernique looking out
over the ridges of hills and the flats listlessly so listlessly that
by one of those flashes of intuitive perception that light us far along
waiting paths Steering knew suddenly that he had to deal with a man
whose experience had somehow crossed the Canaan TigmoresAnd also
Mistaire Steering we have to the far south the Boston Range in
Arkansas and far to the west the Kiamichi in the Territoree
Yes but about these Canaan Tigmores Mr Bernique insisted Steering
not at all deflected by Berniques effort what about your Canaan
Tigmores Mr Bernique Steerings experience with the French
Missourian had been too fragmentary for anything but conjecture to come
of it and his own plans were too immature and too heavily conditioned
for him to project them directly but he had a feeling that he should
want to know Bernique better some fine day and he was moved to get some
sort of grip upon the old mans interest while the chance lasted The
Canaan Tigmores are not as far away as the Boston Mountains Mr
Bernique Much nearer than the Kiamichi Whats your idea about the
Canaan Tigmoresin relation to zinc Mr Bernique
Pouf The old man made airy rings of smoke from the cigar with which
Steering had furnished him He would not talk about the Canaan Tigmores
at all You will see Mr Crittenton Madeira in Canaan about all that
he said And now sir I have the regret to leave you Our roads part
at the signpost yonder I ride east
Well tell you what I wish cried Steering with the pertinacity that
was a part of him I am on my way to Mr Crittenton Madeira now and I
wish you would come to me in Canaan some soon day and let me tell you
the result of my business with him Time was limited for the horses
were close to the crossroads signpost The Canaan Tigmores wont
always belong to old Bruce Grierson Mr Bernique It was a random
shot but it told against Berniques glumness
Pouf The batfool The blind mole
The Canaan Tigmores are entailed Mr Bernique The next owner may have
eyes
God grant growled Old Bernique
Grey eyes eh Mr Bernique Steering flashed his own eyes smilingly
at the French Missourian The horses were at the signpost
Eh what cried Old Bernique is it that
We shall meet again Mr Bernique
I ride east for many a day I think said Bernique dubiously
But you come back to Canaan
Ah God in Heaven yes cried the old man then with a sudden fierce
impetuosity I ride east ride west ride the wide world ovaire but
always I come backcome back to Canaan He stopped abruptly as
though afraid of himself and faced Steering for a silent moment
Up to the silence cleaving it gently musically there came
unexpectedly the notes of a rollicking song
The taters grow an grow they grow
On the instant old Berniques face relaxed pleasantly He half grunted
half laughed The potato song he cried his eyes gay his mouth
twitching Mistaire Steering if you will ride on a little way you will
have fine company That is the trampboy yondaire He is in the woods
above the gulch there He will have emerge to the road presently The
yong scamp is musical sair
Aye hear that cried Steering appreciatively gloriously musical
Out of the great green timber mounted the tenor notes piercingly sweet
pure true like a birdcall
A taters good ith lasses
Berniques horse was growing restless The old man rode a little nearer
Steering and regarded him searchingly Goodbye sair he said then
it shall be what you say I shall come back to you in Canaan
Goodbye Mr Bernique Im glad to have you decide that way Steering
clung to his notion that he and Bernique were to know each other better
They shook hands under the crossroads signpost with understanding
The rain was coming on fast All the east lay grey behind Steering all
the west grey before him as he moved away from the crossroads But out
of the west rolled the melody of the carolling boy the voice of one
singing in the wilderness young and undismayed
Under the crossroads signpost old Bernique sat his horse motionless
for a time looking after Steering From Steering his eyes roamed afar
toward the Canaan Tigmores A little shiver caught him The man that
was expect he mused the man that was expect Then he too rode
away
Chapter Two
PINEY OF THE WOODS
Where the ridge road dropped down close to the pale river at a dip in
the hills Steering overtook the trampboy hallooed to him and watched
him as he turned his pony about and sat waitingly He was a youth of
sixteen or seventeen and from under the peak of his felt hat slouched
and old peered out a slim young gypsy face crowned by a thick mop of
black hair that tumbled about wide temples Motionless there the
tremble of his song still on his lips and the gladness of youth and
health on his face the trampboy made Steering think of the rosy young
shepherd Adonis he was so glowing so fine and fresh
I have been right after you all the way from the crossroads
explained Steering by way of a beginning riding up to the lads side
I have just parted from a friend of yoursMr Berniqueso you see
we are almost friends ourselves
Amost The boy smiled showing white teeth He seemed to like Bruces
method of dealing with him Wuz Unc Bernique cross because I didnt go
rat back like I said Id do he queried slily
No I think not And for my part I am glad you didnt for I am hoping
that if you are going toward Poetical you wont mind my company You
see its pretty dogon lonely A very little of the ridge road
sufficed to make Bruce sick for comradeship and his voice showed it
The boy turned an impressionable sympathetic face
Come rat along he said He looked at Bruce a moment questioningly
before adding Reckins haow you aint usen to the quiet yit Taint so
lonely the woods an the hills whend you know um He twisted his head
like a bird and looked out across the extensive sweep of the land and
the long slow curve of the river a deep inspiration swelling his chest
Simlike they up an talk to you the woods an the hills an the quiet
whend you know um he said
All on the instant Steering knew that as in the case of Old Bernique
here again was character Character seemed distinctly the richest and
the pleasantest thing in Missouri He rode in a little closer to his
companion drawn to him irresistibly recognising in him the sweet
untutored poetry of a wildwood nature whose young timidity was
trembling and steadying into the placating magnetic assurance of a boy
freshhearted as a berry Steering had encountered the same sort of
poetry in other unspoiled boys splendid childmen whom he had known in
other walks of life and he had a quick affection for it It was always
as though on its crystal clearness a man might see the white sails of
his own youth set back toward him
Yes he answered I think you are right about that They do talk the
hills and the woods and the quietonly a fellow grows dull gets his
ears full of electric gongs and pushbells and forgets to listen
The boy looked up with quickwitted question Yaint fm this part of
the kentry air you he asked
No I am fromwell from Bessietown last Where are you from
The boy laughed and glanced gaily at his briartorn clothes Fm the
woods he said
My name is Bruce Steering
Mines Piney
They fell then to talking of many things as they rode toward Poetical
but inevitably they spoke chiefly of the great State of Missouri On the
subject of Missouri the boy talked as old Bernique had talked with
expansive naivete In his roamings he had ridden the State up and down
and had found much to love in it Youll like her too all righty he
told Bruce confidently whend you git broke to her On one of youths
candid impulses to speak up for the life on the inside the cherished
desire the gallant ideal the buoyant fancy he made a supple sudden
divergence in the conversation Dyou know he said they aint no
place whur Id drur be than Mizzourah ceppen only one
Wheres that asked Bruce and to his immense astonishment the boy
answered quickly
Italy
Why how does that happen Piney Ever been there
Nope Hearn Unc Bernique tell abaout it thass all It ud suit me
though I know that His eyes grew dreamy and he seemed to be looking
far beyond Missouri One could almost see the fine illusory spell of
the far Latin land upon him the spiritual bond the pull of temperament
that made the hill boy at one with Italy blest of poetry I dn know
huccome I want to go so bad he went on with a deep breath wouldn
turn araoun thee times on my heels to go anywhur else but I shoo do
want to go to Italy
Were your people Italians Piney
Nope Kim fm Sloois But still I got that feelin abaout Italy
Simlike Id beoh sorta at home tha Had that same feelin ev since
Unc Bernique begand to tell me abaout Italy Im agoin tha tew
some day all righty he concluded at last waking up from his little
dream slowly Goin to be long over to Poetical Mist Steerin he
diverged again with his lively mental agility
No son From Poetical I am going on toBruce stopped to gather
strength to project the word with the large and cadenced inflection he
had enjoyed in the hill farm peoplegoing on to Canaan
Gret gosh said the boy and something in the way he said it made
Bruce look at him quickly Pineys brows were lifted and his lips were
pulled back He seemed to try to be as much impressed as Bruce expected
him to be To Steering this sort of comradeship was growing golden
Well now he said playing with the little joy of being understood
havent they the courthouse at Canaan And the railroad And havent
they Miss Betsyor MissMiss
Sally
Ah yes Sally Know Sally son
Evbody in the Tigmores knows her
I am beginning to want to know Sally myself Bruce let his eyes go
drowsing toward the pale river up which the slow rain was beating and
talked foolishness idly Redcheeked Sally Freckled Sally Rolypoly
Sally Whats a Missouri girl like anyway Piney
Wy people think shes purty protested the boy with a quick palpitant
shyness an most people l he stopped trying to talk laughing
brusquely and flushing with a very young mans selfconsciousness
All of which goes to prove me an ass cried Bruce for talking about
a lady whom I have never seen Looking repentantly at Piney he felt a
sudden ache for him He was not very familiar with conditions in Canaan
but it occurred to him suddenly that even in Canaan there might be
social gradations and that the trampboy rare little chap though he
seemed to be was probably miles away from the daughter of the promoter
Mr Crittenton Madeira I retract Piney he added gravely
Awnot as I keer whut you say abaout heror whut anybody says
Piney slashed at some brilliant sumach by the wayside and his mobile
lips jerked and quivered
I should have supposed that she was olderwell than you said Bruce
trying to set himself right
May be in what she knowsaint in what she feelsnot as I keer
The boy was so deliciously new to his own emotions that they flashed
away beyond his control minute by minute His eyes looked misty with
a little spark of high light cutting bravely through He would not
finish his sentence Did Unc Bernique say whend hes comin back to
Canaan he asked moodily
No he didnt though I urged him to Thats a fine old man Piney
Pineys eyes softened beautifully Takes mighty good keer of me he
said
Is he kin to you
I dn know abaout that Hes took my side always Ysee I aint got no
people an I just ride araoun YseePiney quivered with boyish
fireI just got to ride araoun I caynt stay on no farm an in no
haouse Kills me I got to git to the woods an the hills An Unc
Bernique he stands by me an keeps me in his shack whend theys any
trouble abaout it Ysee some people think I oughteroughter work
Piney laughed from the gay melodious depths of his vagabond heart and
Bruce laughed with him An Unc Bernique has heped me abaout that
explained the trampboy He let his dancing eyes dart off to the west
where the hills were shouldering into a thickening drift of grey Hi
look yonder he cried We got to cut and run to git to Poetical
before that rain
So they cut and ran the boy setting the pace and singing lustily with
that high melody of voice as of temperament of his as they dashed
down the road in the first cool scattering pelt of the rain Want to go
to the hotel dont you he called over his shoulder and Bruce
called yes It was grey rainy twilight now and through the gloom five
or six houses sprawled out across the little plateau toward which the
road twisted Some geese flew up under the feet of the horses squawking
wildly some razorback hogs grunted from the dustwallows some
cowbells tinkled some small yellow spheres of light shone through
windows
How far from Poetical Piney shouted Steering
Baout a foot answered Piney He made his lightninglike pony go more
slowly so that Bruces horse might come alongside and he shook his
head his ready sympathy again on his face Say its goin to be
kinder tough on you to stay here tonight aint it This is ev spittin
bit there is tew Poetical Heres the hotel
They drew rein before a rickety twostory frame building and Bruce
lifted his shoulders shudderingly A man came out on the hotel porch
said Howdy and waited
SayPiney in a lower tone voiced a notion that evidently drifted in
to him on the high tide of his sympathywhy dont you ride over to
Mist Crit Madeiras Taint so far Ill show you the way They cand
take care of you over tha Theyd be glad to have you You cand caount
on that Its thataway in Mizzourah The boys conscientious
earnestness was sweet He was in good spirits again and he whisked one
roughlybooted foot out of its stirrup and laid it across his
saddlehorn while he regarded Bruce You cand git ter see Miss Sally
ef you do that he added pursing up his lips a subtle sense of humour
