ANNE of the ISLAND
by Lucy Maud Montgomery
Chapter I
The Shadow of Change
Harvest is ended and summer is gone quoted Anne Shirley gazing
across the shorn fields dreamily She and Diana Barry had been picking
apples in the Green Gables orchard but were now resting from their
labors in a sunny corner where airy fleets of thistledown drifted by
on the wings of a wind that was still summersweet with the incense of
ferns in the Haunted Wood
But everything in the landscape around them spoke of autumn The sea was
roaring hollowly in the distance the fields were bare and sere scarfed
with golden rod the brook valley below Green Gables overflowed
with asters of ethereal purple and the Lake of Shining Waters was
blueblueblue not the changeful blue of spring nor the pale azure
of summer but a clear steadfast serene blue as if the water
were past all moods and tenses of emotion and had settled down to a
tranquility unbroken by fickle dreams
It has been a nice summer said Diana twisting the new ring on her
left hand with a smile And Miss Lavendars wedding seemed to come as
a sort of crown to it I suppose Mr and Mrs Irving are on the Pacific
coast now
It seems to me they have been gone long enough to go around the world
sighed Anne
I cant believe it is only a week since they were married Everything
has changed Miss Lavendar and Mr and Mrs Allan gonehow lonely the
manse looks with the shutters all closed I went past it last night and
it made me feel as if everybody in it had died
Well never get another minister as nice as Mr Allan said Diana
with gloomy conviction I suppose well have all kinds of supplies this
winter and half the Sundays no preaching at all And you and Gilbert
goneit will be awfully dull
Fred will be here insinuated Anne slyly
When is Mrs Lynde going to move up asked Diana as if she had not
heard Annes remark
Tomorrow Im glad shes comingbut it will be another change Marilla
and I cleared everything out of the spare room yesterday Do you know
I hated to do it Of course it was sillybut it did seem as if we
were committing sacrilege That old spare room has always seemed like
a shrine to me When I was a child I thought it the most wonderful
apartment in the world You remember what a consuming desire I had to
sleep in a spare room bedbut not the Green Gables spare room Oh no
never there It would have been too terribleI couldnt have slept a
wink from awe I never WALKED through that room when Marilla sent me in
on an errandno indeed I tiptoed through it and held my breath as if
I were in church and felt relieved when I got out of it The pictures
of George Whitefield and the Duke of Wellington hung there one on each
side of the mirror and frowned so sternly at me all the time I was in
especially if I dared peep in the mirror which was the only one in the
house that didnt twist my face a little I always wondered how Marilla
dared houseclean that room And now its not only cleaned but stripped
bare George Whitefield and the Duke have been relegated to the upstairs
hall So passes the glory of this world concluded Anne with a
laugh in which there was a little note of regret It is never pleasant
to have our old shrines desecrated even when we have outgrown them
Ill be so lonesome when you go moaned Diana for the hundredth time
And to think you go next week
But were together still said Anne cheerily We mustnt let next
week rob us of this weeks joy I hate the thought of going myselfhome
and I are such good friends Talk of being lonesome Its I who should
groan YOULL be here with any number of your old friendsAND Fred
While I shall be alone among strangers not knowing a soul
EXCEPT GilbertAND Charlie Sloane said Diana imitating Annes
italics and slyness
Charlie Sloane will be a great comfort of course agreed Anne
sarcastically whereupon both those irresponsible damsels laughed Diana
knew exactly what Anne thought of Charlie Sloane but despite sundry
confidential talks she did not know just what Anne thought of Gilbert
Blythe To be sure Anne herself did not know that
The boys may be boarding at the other end of Kingsport for all I
know Anne went on I am glad Im going to Redmond and I am sure I
shall like it after a while But for the first few weeks I know I wont
I shant even have the comfort of looking forward to the weekend visit
home as I had when I went to Queens Christmas will seem like a
thousand years away
Everything is changingor going to change said Diana sadly I have
a feeling that things will never be the same again Anne
We have come to a parting of the ways I suppose said Anne
thoughtfully We had to come to it Do you think Diana that being
grownup is really as nice as we used to imagine it would be when we
were children
I dont knowthere are SOME nice things about it answered Diana
again caressing her ring with that little smile which always had the
effect of making Anne feel suddenly left out and inexperienced But
there are so many puzzling things too Sometimes I feel as if being
grownup just frightened meand then I would give anything to be a
little girl again
I suppose well get used to being grownup in time said Anne
cheerfully There wont be so many unexpected things about it by and
bythough after all I fancy its the unexpected things that give
spice to life Were eighteen Diana In two more years well be twenty
When I was ten I thought twenty was a green old age In no time youll
be a staid middleaged matron and I shall be nice old maid Aunt Anne
coming to visit you on vacations Youll always keep a corner for me
wont you Di darling Not the spare room of courseold maids cant
aspire to spare rooms and I shall be as umble as Uriah Heep and quite
content with a little overtheporch or offtheparlor cubby hole
What nonsense you do talk Anne laughed Diana Youll marry somebody
splendid and handsome and richand no spare room in Avonlea will be
half gorgeous enough for youand youll turn up your nose at all the
friends of your youth
That would be a pity my nose is quite nice but I fear turning it up
would spoil it said Anne patting that shapely organ I havent so
many good features that I could afford to spoil those I have so even
if I should marry the King of the Cannibal Islands I promise you I
wont turn up my nose at you Diana
With another gay laugh the girls separated Diana to return to Orchard
Slope Anne to walk to the Post Office She found a letter awaiting her
there and when Gilbert Blythe overtook her on the bridge over the Lake
of Shining Waters she was sparkling with the excitement of it
Priscilla Grant is going to Redmond too she exclaimed Isnt that
splendid I hoped she would but she didnt think her father would
consent He has however and were to board together I feel that I can
face an army with bannersor all the professors of Redmond in one fell
phalanxwith a chum like Priscilla by my side
I think well like Kingsport said Gilbert Its a nice old burg
they tell me and has the finest natural park in the world Ive heard
that the scenery in it is magnificent
I wonder if it will becan beany more beautiful than this murmured
Anne looking around her with the loving enraptured eyes of those to
whom home must always be the loveliest spot in the world no matter
what fairer lands may lie under alien stars
They were leaning on the bridge of the old pond drinking deep of the
enchantment of the dusk just at the spot where Anne had climbed from
her sinking Dory on the day Elaine floated down to Camelot The fine
empurpling dye of sunset still stained the western skies but the moon
was rising and the water lay like a great silver dream in her light
Remembrance wove a sweet and subtle spell over the two young creatures
You are very quiet Anne said Gilbert at last
Im afraid to speak or move for fear all this wonderful beauty will
vanish just like a broken silence breathed Anne
Gilbert suddenly laid his hand over the slender white one lying on the
rail of the bridge His hazel eyes deepened into darkness his still
boyish lips opened to say something of the dream and hope that thrilled
his soul But Anne snatched her hand away and turned quickly The spell
of the dusk was broken for her
I must go home she exclaimed with a rather overdone carelessness
Marilla had a headache this afternoon and Im sure the twins will be
in some dreadful mischief by this time I really shouldnt have stayed
away so long
She chattered ceaselessly and inconsequently until they reached the
Green Gables lane Poor Gilbert hardly had a chance to get a word in
edgewise Anne felt rather relieved when they parted There had been a
new secret selfconsciousness in her heart with regard to Gilbert ever
since that fleeting moment of revelation in the garden of Echo
Lodge Something alien had intruded into the old perfect schoolday
comradeshipsomething that threatened to mar it
I never felt glad to see Gilbert go before she thought
halfresentfully halfsorrowfully as she walked alone up the lane
Our friendship will be spoiled if he goes on with this nonsense
It mustnt be spoiledI wont let it Oh WHY cant boys be just
sensible
Anne had an uneasy doubt that it was not strictly sensible that
she should still feel on her hand the warm pressure of Gilberts as
distinctly as she had felt it for the swift second his had rested
there and still less sensible that the sensation was far from being an
unpleasant onevery different from that which had attended a similar
demonstration on Charlie Sloanes part when she had been sitting out a
dance with him at a White Sands party three nights before Anne shivered
over the disagreeable recollection But all problems connected with
infatuated swains vanished from her mind when she entered the
homely unsentimental atmosphere of the Green Gables kitchen where an
eightyearold boy was crying grievously on the sofa
What is the matter Davy asked Anne taking him up in her arms
Where are Marilla and Dora
Marillas putting Dora to bed sobbed Davy and Im crying cause
Dora fell down the outside cellar steps heels over head and scraped
all the skin off her nose and
Oh well dont cry about it dear Of course you are sorry for her
but crying wont help her any Shell be all right tomorrow Crying
never helps any one Davyboy and
I aint crying cause Dora fell down cellar said Davy cutting short
Annes wellmeant preachment with increasing bitterness Im crying
cause I wasnt there to see her fall Im always missing some fun or
other seems to me
Oh Davy Anne choked back an unholy shriek of laughter Would you
call it fun to see poor little Dora fall down the steps and get hurt
She wasnt MUCH hurt said Davy defiantly Course if shed been
killed Id have been real sorry Anne But the Keiths aint so easy
killed Theyre like the Blewetts I guess Herb Blewett fell off the
hayloft last Wednesday and rolled right down through the turnip chute
into the box stall where they had a fearful wild cross horse and
rolled right under his heels And still he got out alive with only
three bones broke Mrs Lynde says there are some folks you cant kill
with a meataxe Is Mrs Lynde coming here tomorrow Anne
Yes Davy and I hope youll be always very nice and good to her
Ill be nice and good But will she ever put me to bed at nights
Anne
Perhaps Why
Cause said Davy very decidedly if she does I wont say my prayers
before her like I do before you Anne
Why not
Cause I dont think it would be nice to talk to God before strangers
Anne Dora can say hers to Mrs Lynde if she likes but I wont Ill
wait till shes gone and then say em Wont that be all right Anne
Yes if you are sure you wont forget to say them Davyboy
Oh I wont forget you bet I think saying my prayers is great fun
But it wont be as good fun saying them alone as saying them to you
I wish youd stay home Anne I dont see what you want to go away and
leave us for
I dont exactly WANT to Davy but I feel I ought to go
If you dont want to go you neednt Youre grown up When Im grown
up Im not going to do one single thing I dont want to do Anne
All your life Davy youll find yourself doing things you dont want
to do
I wont said Davy flatly Catch me I have to do things I dont want
to now cause you and Marillall send me to bed if I dont But when I
grow up you cant do that and therell be nobody to tell me not to do
things Wont I have the time Say Anne Milty Boulter says his mother
says youre going to college to see if you can catch a man Are you
Anne I want to know
For a second Anne burned with resentment Then she laughed reminding
herself that Mrs Boulters crude vulgarity of thought and speech could
not harm her
No Davy Im not Im going to study and grow and learn about many
things
What things
Shoes and ships and sealing wax
And cabbages and kings
quoted Anne
But if you DID want to catch a man how would you go about it I want
to know persisted Davy for whom the subject evidently possessed a
certain fascination
Youd better ask Mrs Boulter said Anne thoughtlessly I think its
likely she knows more about the process than I do
I will the next time I see her said Davy gravely
Davy If you do cried Anne realizing her mistake
But you just told me to protested Davy aggrieved
Its time you went to bed decreed Anne by way of getting out of the
scrape
After Davy had gone to bed Anne wandered down to Victoria Island and sat
there alone curtained with finespun moonlit gloom while the water
laughed around her in a duet of brook and wind Anne had always loved
that brook Many a dream had she spun over its sparkling water in
days gone by She forgot lovelorn youths and the cayenne speeches of
malicious neighbors and all the problems of her girlish existence In
imagination she sailed over storied seas that wash the distant shining
shores of faery lands forlorn where lost Atlantis and Elysium lie
with the evening star for pilot to the land of Hearts Desire And she
was richer in those dreams than in realities for things seen pass away
but the things that are unseen are eternal
Chapter II
Garlands of Autumn
The following week sped swiftly crowded with innumerable last things
as Anne called them Goodbye calls had to be made and received being
pleasant or otherwise according to whether callers and calledupon
were heartily in sympathy with Annes hopes or thought she was too much
puffedup over going to college and that it was their duty to take her
down a peg or two
The AVIS gave a farewell party in honor of Anne and Gilbert one
evening at the home of Josie Pye choosing that place partly because
Mr Pyes house was large and convenient partly because it was strongly
suspected that the Pye girls would have nothing to do with the affair if
their offer of the house for the party was not accepted It was a very
pleasant little time for the Pye girls were gracious and said and did
nothing to mar the harmony of the occasionwhich was not according
to their wont Josie was unusually amiableso much so that she even
remarked condescendingly to Anne
Your new dress is rather becoming to you Anne Really you look ALMOST
PRETTY in it
How kind of you to say so responded Anne with dancing eyes Her
sense of humor was developing and the speeches that would have hurt her
at fourteen were becoming merely food for amusement now Josie suspected
that Anne was laughing at her behind those wicked eyes but she
contented herself with whispering to Gertie as they went downstairs
that Anne Shirley would put on more airs than ever now that she was
going to collegeyoud see
All the old crowd was there full of mirth and zest and youthful
lightheartedness Diana Barry rosy and dimpled shadowed by the
faithful Fred Jane Andrews neat and sensible and plain Ruby Gillis
looking her handsomest and brightest in a cream silk blouse with red
geraniums in her golden hair Gilbert Blythe and Charlie Sloane both
trying to keep as near the elusive Anne as possible Carrie Sloane
looking pale and melancholy because so it was reported her father
would not allow Oliver Kimball to come near the place Moody Spurgeon
MacPherson whose round face and objectionable ears were as round and
objectionable as ever and Billy Andrews who sat in a corner all the
evening chuckled when any one spoke to him and watched Anne Shirley
with a grin of pleasure on his broad freckled countenance
Anne had known beforehand of the party but she had not known that she
and Gilbert were as the founders of the Society to be presented with
a very complimentary address and tokens of respectin her case a
volume of Shakespeares plays in Gilberts a fountain pen She was so
taken by surprise and pleased by the nice things said in the address
read in Moody Spurgeons most solemn and ministerial tones that the
tears quite drowned the sparkle of her big gray eyes She had worked
hard and faithfully for the AVIS and it warmed the cockles of her
heart that the members appreciated her efforts so sincerely And they
were all so nice and friendly and jollyeven the Pye girls had their
merits at that moment Anne loved all the world
She enjoyed the evening tremendously but the end of it rather spoiled
all Gilbert again made the mistake of saying something sentimental
to her as they ate their supper on the moonlit verandah and Anne to
punish him was gracious to Charlie Sloane and allowed the latter to
walk home with her She found however that revenge hurts nobody quite
so much as the one who tries to inflict it Gilbert walked airily off
with Ruby Gillis and Anne could hear them laughing and talking gaily as
they loitered along in the still crisp autumn air They were evidently
having the best of good times while she was horribly bored by Charlie
Sloane who talked unbrokenly on and never even by accident said one
thing that was worth listening to Anne gave an occasional absent yes
or no and thought how beautiful Ruby had looked that night how
very goggly Charlies eyes were in the moonlightworse even than by
daylightand that the world somehow wasnt quite such a nice place as
she had believed it to be earlier in the evening
Im just tired outthat is what is the matter with me she said when
she thankfully found herself alone in her own room And she honestly
believed it was But a certain little gush of joy as from some secret
unknown spring bubbled up in her heart the next evening when she saw
Gilbert striding down through the Haunted Wood and crossing the old log
bridge with that firm quick step of his So Gilbert was not going to
spend this last evening with Ruby Gillis after all
You look tired Anne he said
I am tired and worse than that Im disgruntled Im tired because
Ive been packing my trunk and sewing all day But Im disgruntled
because six women have been here to say goodbye to me and every one of
the six managed to say something that seemed to take the color right
out of life and leave it as gray and dismal and cheerless as a November
morning
Spiteful old cats was Gilberts elegant comment
Oh no they werent said Anne seriously That is just the trouble
If they had been spiteful cats I wouldnt have minded them But they are
all nice kind motherly souls who like me and whom I like and that is
why what they said or hinted had such undue weight with me They let
me see they thought I was crazy going to Redmond and trying to take
a BA and ever since Ive been wondering if I am Mrs Peter Sloane
sighed and said she hoped my strength would hold out till I got through
and at once I saw myself a hopeless victim of nervous prostration at the
end of my third year Mrs Eben Wright said it must cost an awful lot
to put in four years at Redmond and I felt all over me that it was
unpardonable of me to squander Marillas money and my own on such a
folly Mrs Jasper Bell said she hoped I wouldnt let college spoil me
as it did some people and I felt in my bones that the end of my four
Redmond years would see me a most insufferable creature thinking I knew
it all and looking down on everything and everybody in Avonlea Mrs
Elisha Wright said she understood that Redmond girls especially those
who belonged to Kingsport were dreadful dressy and stuckup and she
guessed I wouldnt feel much at home among them and I saw myself a
snubbed dowdy humiliated country girl shuffling through Redmonds
classic halls in coppertoned boots
Anne ended with a laugh and a sigh commingled With her sensitive nature
all disapproval had weight even the disapproval of those for whose
opinions she had scant respect For the time being life was savorless
and ambition had gone out like a snuffed candle
You surely dont care for what they said protested Gilbert You know
exactly how narrow their outlook on life is excellent creatures though
they are To do anything THEY have never done is anathema maranatha You
are the first Avonlea girl who has ever gone to college and you
know that all pioneers are considered to be afflicted with moonstruck
madness
Oh I know But FEELING is so different from KNOWING My common sense
tells me all you can say but there are times when common sense has
no power over me Common nonsense takes possession of my soul Really
after Mrs Elisha went away I hardly had the heart to finish packing
Youre just tired Anne Come forget it all and take a walk with
mea ramble back through the woods beyond the marsh There should be
something there I want to show you
Should be Dont you know if it is there
No I only know it should be from something I saw there in spring
Come on Well pretend we are two children again and well go the way of
the wind
They started gaily off Anne remembering the unpleasantness of the
preceding evening was very nice to Gilbert and Gilbert who was
learning wisdom took care to be nothing save the schoolboy comrade
again Mrs Lynde and Marilla watched them from the kitchen window
Thatll be a match some day Mrs Lynde said approvingly
Marilla winced slightly In her heart she hoped it would but it went
against her grain to hear the matter spoken of in Mrs Lyndes gossipy
matteroffact way
Theyre only children yet she said shortly
Mrs Lynde laughed goodnaturedly
Anne is eighteen I was married when I was that age We old folks
Marilla are too much given to thinking children never grow up thats
what Anne is a young woman and Gilberts a man and he worships the
ground she walks on as any one can see Hes a fine fellow and Anne
cant do better I hope she wont get any romantic nonsense into her
head at Redmond I dont approve of them coeducational places and never
did thats what I dont believe concluded Mrs Lynde solemnly that
the students at such colleges ever do much else than flirt
They must study a little said Marilla with a smile
Precious little sniffed Mrs Rachel However I think Anne will She
never was flirtatious But she doesnt appreciate Gilbert at his full
value thats what Oh I know girls Charlie Sloane is wild about her
too but Id never advise her to marry a Sloane The Sloanes are good
honest respectable people of course But when alls said and done
theyre SLOANES
Marilla nodded To an outsider the statement that Sloanes were Sloanes
might not be very illuminating but she understood Every village has
such a family good honest respectable people they may be but SLOANES
they are and must ever remain though they speak with the tongues of men
and angels
Gilbert and Anne happily unconscious that their future was thus being
settled by Mrs Rachel were sauntering through the shadows of the
Haunted Wood Beyond the harvest hills were basking in an amber sunset
radiance under a pale aerial sky of rose and blue The distant spruce
groves were burnished bronze and their long shadows barred the upland
meadows But around them a little wind sang among the fir tassels and
in it there was the note of autumn
This wood really is haunted nowby old memories said Anne stooping
to gather a spray of ferns bleached to waxen whiteness by frost It
seems to me that the little girls Diana and I used to be play here
still and sit by the Dryads Bubble in the twilights trysting with
the ghosts Do you know I can never go up this path in the dusk without
feeling a bit of the old fright and shiver There was one especially
horrifying phantom which we createdthe ghost of the murdered child
that crept up behind you and laid cold fingers on yours I confess that
to this day I cannot help fancying its little furtive footsteps behind
me when I come here after nightfall Im not afraid of the White Lady or
the headless man or the skeletons but I wish I had never imagined that
babys ghost into existence How angry Marilla and Mrs Barry were over
that affair concluded Anne with reminiscent laughter
The woods around the head of the marsh were full of purple vistas
threaded with gossamers Past a dour plantation of gnarled spruces and
a maplefringed sunwarm valley they found the something Gilbert was
looking for
Ah here it is he said with satisfaction
An apple treeand away back here exclaimed Anne delightedly
Yes a veritable applebearing apple tree too here in the very midst
of pines and beeches a mile away from any orchard I was here one day
last spring and found it all white with blossom So I resolved Id come
again in the fall and see if it had been apples See its loaded They
look good tootawny as russets but with a dusky red cheek Most wild
seedlings are green and uninviting
I suppose it sprang years ago from some chancesown seed said Anne
dreamily And how it has grown and flourished and held its own here all
alone among aliens the brave determined thing
Heres a fallen tree with a cushion of moss Sit down Anneit will
serve for a woodland throne Ill climb for some apples They all grow
highthe tree had to reach up to the sunlight
The apples proved to be delicious Under the tawny skin was a white
white flesh faintly veined with red and besides their own proper
apple taste they had a certain wild delightful tang no orchardgrown
apple ever possessed
The fatal apple of Eden couldnt have had a rarer flavor commented
Anne But its time we were going home See it was twilight three
minutes ago and now its moonlight What a pity we couldnt have caught
the moment of transformation But such moments never are caught I
suppose
Lets go back around the marsh and home by way of Lovers Lane Do you
feel as disgruntled now as when you started out Anne
Not I Those apples have been as manna to a hungry soul I feel that I
shall love Redmond and have a splendid four years there
And after those four yearswhat
Oh theres another bend in the road at their end answered Anne
lightly Ive no idea what may be around itI dont want to have Its
nicer not to know
Lovers Lane was a dear place that night still and mysteriously dim
in the pale radiance of the moonlight They loitered through it in a
pleasant chummy silence neither caring to talk
If Gilbert were always as he has been this evening how nice and simple
everything would be reflected Anne
Gilbert was looking at Anne as she walked along In her light dress
with her slender delicacy she made him think of a white iris
I wonder if I can ever make her care for me he thought with a pang
of selfdestruct
Chapter III
Greeting and Farewell
Charlie Sloane Gilbert Blythe and Anne Shirley left Avonlea the
following Monday morning Anne had hoped for a fine day Diana was to
drive her to the station and they wanted this their last drive together
for some time to be a pleasant one But when Anne went to bed Sunday
night the east wind was moaning around Green Gables with an ominous
prophecy which was fulfilled in the morning Anne awoke to find
raindrops pattering against her window and shadowing the ponds gray
surface with widening rings hills and sea were hidden in mist and the
whole world seemed dim and dreary Anne dressed in the cheerless gray
dawn for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train she
struggled against the tears that WOULD well up in her eyes in spite of
herself She was leaving the home that was so dear to her and something
told her that she was leaving it forever save as a holiday refuge
Things would never be the same again coming back for vacations would
not be living there And oh how dear and beloved everything wasthat
little white porch room sacred to the dreams of girlhood the old Snow
Queen at the window the brook in the hollow the Dryads Bubble the
Haunted Woods and Lovers Laneall the thousand and one dear spots
where memories of the old years bided Could she ever be really happy
anywhere else
Breakfast at Green Gables that morning was a rather doleful meal Davy
for the first time in his life probably could not eat but blubbered
shamelessly over his porridge Nobody else seemed to have much appetite
save Dora who tucked away her rations comfortably Dora like the
immortal and most prudent Charlotte who went on cutting bread and
butter when her frenzied lovers body had been carried past on a
shutter was one of those fortunate creatures who are seldom disturbed
by anything Even at eight it took a great deal to ruffle Doras
placidity She was sorry Anne was going away of course but was that
any reason why she should fail to appreciate a poached egg on toast Not
at all And seeing that Davy could not eat his Dora ate it for him
Promptly on time Diana appeared with horse and buggy her rosy face
glowing above her raincoat The goodbyes had to be said then somehow
Mrs Lynde came in from her quarters to give Anne a hearty embrace and
warn her to be careful of her health whatever she did Marilla brusque
and tearless pecked Annes cheek and said she supposed theyd hear from
her when she got settled A casual observer might have concluded that
Annes going mattered very little to herunless said observer had
happened to get a good look in her eyes Dora kissed Anne primly and
squeezed out two decorous little tears but Davy who had been crying on
the back porch step ever since they rose from the table refused to say
goodbye at all When he saw Anne coming towards him he sprang to his
feet bolted up the back stairs and hid in a clothes closet out of
