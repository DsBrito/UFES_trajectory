CHAPTER I
PARISTHE DODGE CLUBHOW TO SPEAK FRENCHHOW TO RAISE A CROWD
It is a glorious day in Paris The whole city is out in the public
places watching the departure of the army of Italy Every imaginable
uniform on foot and on horseback enlivens the scene Zouaves are
everywhere Cent Gardes hurry to and fro looking ferocious Imperial
Gardes look magnificent Innumerable little redlegged soldiers of the
line dance about gesticulating vehemently Grisettes hang about the
necks of departing braves A great many tears are shed and a great
deal of bombast uttered For the invincible soldiers of France are off
to fight for an idea and doesnt every one of them carry a marshals
baton in his knapsack
A troop of Cent Gardes comes thundering down in a cloud of dust
dashing the people right and left Loud cheers arise Vive
lEmpereur The hoarse voices of myriads prolong the yell It is Louis
Napoleon He touches his hat gracefully to the crowd
A chasseur leaps into a cab
Where shall I take you
To Glory shouts the soldier
The crowd applaud The cabman drives off and dont want any further
direction Here a bigbearded Zouave kisses his bigbearded brother in
a blouse
Adieu mon frere write me
Where shall I write
Direct to Viennaposte restante
Every body laughs at every thing and the crowd are quite wild at
this
A young man is perched upon a pillar near the garden wall of the
Tuileries He enjoys the scene immensely After a while he takes a
clay pipe from his pocket and slowly fills it Having completed this
business he draws a match along the stone and is just about lighting
his pipe
Halloo
Down drops the lighted match on the neck of an ouvrier It burns
The man scowls up but seeing the cause smiles and waves his hand
forgivingly
Dick
At this a young man in the midst of the crowd stops and looks around
He is a short young man in whose face there is a strange mixture of
innocence and shrewdness He is pulling a babycarriage containing a
small specimen of French nationality and behind him walks a majestic
female
The young man Dick takes a quick survey and recognizes the person who
has called him Down drops the pole of the carriage and to the
horror of the majestic female he darts off and springing up the
pillar grasps first the foot and then the hand of his friend
Buttons he cried what you you here in Paris
I believe I am
Why when did you come
About a month ago
I had no idea of it I didnt know you were here
And I didnt know that you were I thought by this time that you were
in Italy What has kept you here so long
Dick looked confused
Why the fact is I am studying German
German in Paris French you mean
No German
Youre crazy who with
Dick nodded his head toward his late companion
What that woman How she is scowling at us
Is she said Dick with some trepidation
Yes But dont look Have you been with her all the time
Yes seven months
Studying German cried Buttons with a laugh Who is she
Madame Bang
Illustration Here I Invite My Friends
Bang Well Madame Bang must look out for another lodger You must
come with me young man You need a guardian Its well that I came in
time to rescue you Lets be off
And the two youths descended and were soon lost in the crowd
Three flights of steps are bad enough but great Heavens what do you
mean by taking a fellow up to the eighth story
Such was the exclamation of Dick as he fell exhausted into a seat in a
little room at the top of one of the tallest houses in Paris
Economy my dear boy
Ehem
Paris is overflowing and I could get no other place without paying
an enormous price Now I am trying to husband my means
I should think so
I sleep here
And have plenty of bedfellows
I eat here
The powers of the human stomach are astounding
And here I invite my friends
Friends only I should think Nothing but the truest friendship could
make a man hold out in such an ascent
But come What are your plans
I have none
Then you must league yourself with me
I shall be delighted
And Im going to Italy
Then Im afraid our league is already at an end
Why
I havent money enough
How much have you
Only five hundred dollars Ive spent all the rest of my allowance
Five hundred Why man I have only four hundred
What and youre going to Italy
Certainly
Then Ill go too and run the risk But is this the style and Dick
looked dolefully around
By no meansnot always But you must practice economy
Have you any acquaintances
Yes two We three have formed ourselves into a society for the
purpose of going to Italy We call ourselves the Dodge Club
The Dodge Club
Yes Because our principle is to dodge all humbugs and swindles
which make travelling so expensive generally We have gained much
experience already and hope to gain more One of my friends is a
doctor from Philadelphia Doctor Snakeroot and the other is
Senator Jones from Massachusetts Neither the Doctor nor the Senator
understands a word of any language but the American That is the
reason why I became acquainted with them
First as to the Doctor I picked him up at Dunkirk It was in a cafe
I was getting my modest breakfast when I saw him come in He sat down
and boldly asked for coffee After the usual delay the garcon brought
him a small cup filled with what looked like ink On the waiter was a
cup of eau de vie and a little plate containing several enormous
lumps of loafsugar Never shall I forget the Doctors face of
amazement He looked at each article in succession What was the ink
for what the brandy what the sugar He did not know that the two
first when mixed makes the best drink in the world and that the last
is intended for the pocket of the guest by force of a custom dear to
every Frenchman To make a long story short I explained to him the
mysteries of French coffee and we became sworn friends
My meeting with the Senator was under slightly different
circumstances It was early in the morning It was chilly I was
walking briskly out of town Suddenly I turned a corner and came upon
a crowd They surrounded a tall man He was an American and appeared
to be insane First he made gestures like a man hewing or chopping
Then he drew his hand across his throat Then he staggered forward and
pretended to fall Then he groaned heavily After which he raised
himself up and looked at the crowd with an air of mild inquiry They
did not laugh They did not even smile They listened respectfully
for they knew that the strange gentleman wished to express something
On the whole I think if I hadnt come up that the Senator would have
been arrested by a stiff gendarme who was just then coming along the
street As it was I arrived just in time to learn that he was anxious
to see the French mode of killing cattle and was trying to find his way
to the abattoirs The Senator is a fine man but eminently practical He
used to think the French language an accomplishment only He has
changed his mind since his arrival here He has one little
peculiarity and that is to bawl broken English at the top of his
voice when he wants to communicate with foreigners
Illustration The Club
Not long afterward the Dodge Club received a new member in the person
of Mr Dick Whiffletree The introduction took place in a modest cafe
where a dinner of six courses was supplied for the ridiculous sum of
one francsoup a roast a fry a bake a fish a pie bread at
discretion and a glass of vinegar generously thrown in
At one end of the table sat the Senator a very large and muscular
man with irongray hair and features that were very strongly marked
and very strongly American He appeared to be about fifty years of
age At the other sat the Doctor a slender young man in black On
one side sat Buttons and opposite to him was Dick
Buttons said the Senator were you out yesterday
I was
It was a powerful crowd
Rather large
It was immense I never before had any idea of the population of
Paris New York isnt to be compared to it
As to crowds that is nothing uncommon in Paris Set a rat loose in
the Champs Elysees and I bet ten thousand people will be after it in
five minutes
Sho
Any thing will raise a crowd in Paris
It will be a small one then
My dear Senator in an hour from this Ill engage myself to raise as
large a crowd as the one you saw yesterday
My dear Buttons you look like it
Will you bet
Bet Are you in earnest
Never more so
But there is an immense crowd outside already
Then let the scene of my trial be in a less crowded placethe Place
Vendome for instance
Name the conditions
In an hour from this I engage to fill the Place Vendome with people
Whoever fails forfeits a dinner to the Club
The eyes of Dick and the Doctor sparkled
Done said the Senator
All that you have to do said Buttons is to go to the top of the
Colonne Vendome and wave your hat three times when you want me to
begin
Ill do that But its wrong said the Senator Its taking money
from you You must lose
Oh dont be alarmed said Buttons cheerfully
The Dodge Club left for the Place Vendome and the Senator separating
himself from his companions began the ascent Buttons left his
friends at a corner to see the result and walked quickly down a
neighboring street
Illustration The Place Vendome
Dick noticed that every one whom he met stopped stared and then
walked quickly forward looking up at the column These people
accosted others who did the same In a few minutes many hundreds of
people were looking up and exchanging glances with one another
In a short time Buttons had completed the circuit of the block and
reentered the Place by another street He was running at a quick
pace and at a moderate calculation about two thousand gamins de
Paris ran before beside and behind him Gens darmes caught the
excitement and rushed frantically about Soldiers called to one
another and tore across the square gesticulating and shouting
Carriages stopped the occupants stared up at the column horsemen
drew up their rearing horses dogs barked children screamed up
flew a thousand windows out of which five thousand heads were thrust
At the end of twenty minutes after a very laborious journey the
Senator reached the top of the column He looked down A cry of
amazement burst from him The immense Place Vendome was crammed with
human beings Innumerable upturned faces were staring at the startled
Senator All around the lofty houses sent all their inmates to the
open window through which they looked up The very housetops were
crowded Away down all the streets which led to the Place crowds of
human beings poured along
Well muttered the Senator its evident that Buttons understands
these Frenchmen However I must perform my part so here goes
And the Senator majestically removing his hat waved it slowly around
his head seven times At the seventh whirl his fingers slipped and a
great gust of wind caught the hat and blew it far out into the air
It fell
A deep groan of horror burst forth from the multitude so deep so
long so terrible that the Senator turned pale
A hundred thousand heads upturned two hundred thousand arms waved
furiously in the air The tide of newcomers flowing up the other
streets filled the Place to overflowing and the vast host of people
swayed to and fro agitated by a thousand passions All this was the
work of but a short time
Come said the Senator this is getting beyond a joke
There was a sudden movement among the people at the foot of the
column The Senator leaned over to see what it was
At once a great cry came up like the thunder of a cataract
warningly imperiously terribly The Senator drew back confounded
Suddenly he advanced again He shook his head deprecatingly and waved
his arms as if to disclaim any evil motives which they might impute to
him But they did not comprehend him Scores of stiff gens darmes
hundreds of little soldiers stopped in their rush to the foot of the
column to shake their fists and scream at him
Now if I only understood their doosid lingo thought the Senator
Butafter a pauseit wouldnt be of no account up here And what
an awkward fix he added for the father of a family to stand
hatless on the top of a pillory like this Sho
There came a deep rumble from the hollow stairway beneath him which
grew nearer and louder every moment
Somebodys coming said the Senator Waal Im glad Misery loves
company Perhaps I can purchase a hat
In five minutes more the heads of twenty gens darmes shot up through
the opening in the top of the pillar one after another and reminded
the Senator of the JumpupJohnnies in childrens toys Six of them
seized him and made him prisoner
The indignant Senator remonstrated and informed them that he was an
American citizen
His remark made no impression They did not understand English
The Senators wrath made his hair fairly bristle He contented
himself however with drawing up the programme of an immediate war
between France and the Great Republic
It took an hour for the column to get emptied It was choked with
people rushing up Seven gentlemen fainted and three escaped with
badly sprained limbs During this time the Senator remained in the
custody of his captors
At last the column was cleared
The prisoner was taken down and placed in a cab He saw the dense crowd
and heard the mighty murmurs of the people
He was driven away for an immense distance It seemed miles
At last the black walls of a huge edifice rose before him The cab
drove under a dark archway The Senator thought of the dungeons of the
Inquisition and other Old World horrors of which he had heard in his
boyhood
So the Senator had to give the dinner The Club enjoyed it amazingly
Almost at the moment of his entrance Buttons had arrived arm in arm
with the American minister whose representations and explanations
procured the Senators release
