The Play
The initial performance of the play was given in St Louis on the
evening of November 26 1900 and the first New York production was on
the fourteenth of the following January
Its instant and continued success is well known A prominent dramatic
critic of the press has said
Julia Marlowe fully realized the popular idea of the Mary described
by the novelist She seemed to revel in the role With its
instantaneous changes from gay daring to anger and fear from coyness
to the dignity that hedges a princess from resentment to ardent love
the part of Mary Tudor gives Julia Marlowe full scope for the display
of her talent She has never appeared to better or as good advantage
as in this play for the reason that it gives opportunity for broader
and more effective lights and shades than anything she has hitherto
given us

The Caskodens
We Caskodens take great pride in our ancestry Some persons I know
hold all that to be totally unSolomonlike and the height of vanity
but they usually have no ancestors of whom to be proud The man who
does not know who his greatgrandfather was naturally enough would
not care what he was The Caskodens have pride of ancestry because
they know both who and what
Even admitting that it is vanity at all it is an impersonal sort of
failing which like the excessive love of country leans virtueward
for the man who fears to disgrace his ancestors is certainly less
likely to disgrace himself Of course there are a great many excellent
persons who can go no farther back than father and mother who
doubtless eat and drink and sleep as well and love as happily as if
they could trace an unbroken lineage clear back to Adam or Noah or
somebody of that sort Nevertheless we Caskodens are proud of our
ancestry and expect to remain so to the end of the chapter
regardless of whom it pleases or displeases
We have a right to be proud for there is an unbroken male line from
William the Conqueror down to the present time In this lineal list
are fourteen Baronsthe title lapsed when Charles I felltwelve
Knights of the Garter and fortyseven Knights of the Bath and other
orders A Caskoden distinguished himself by gallant service under the
Great Norman and was given rich English lands and a fair Saxon bride
albeit an unwilling one as his reward With this fair unwilling
Saxon bride and her long plait of yellow hair goes a very pretty
pathetic story which I may tell you at some future time if you take
kindly to this A Caskoden was seneschal to William Rufus and sat at
the rich half barbaric banquets in the first Great Hall Still
another was one of the doughty barons who wrested from John the Great
Charter Englands declaration of independence another was high in
the councils of Henry V I have omitted one whom I should not fail to
mention Adjodika Caskoden who was a member of the Dunce Parliament
of Henry IV so called because there were no lawyers in it
It is true that in the time of Edward IV a Caskoden did stoop to
trade but it was trade of the most dignified honorable sort he was
a goldsmith and his guild as you know were the bankers and
international clearance house for people king and nobles Besides it
is stated on good authority that there was a great scandal wherein the
goldsmiths wife was mixed up in an intrigue with the noble King
Edward so we learn that even in trade the Caskodens were of honorable
position and basked in the smile of their prince As for myself I am
not one of those who object so much to trade and I think it
contemptible in a man to screw his nose all out of place sneering at
it while enjoying every luxury of life from its profits
This goldsmith was shrewd enough to turn what some persons might call
his ill fortune in one way into gain in another He was one of those
happily constituted thrifty philosophers who hold that even
misfortune should not be wasted and that no evil is so great but the
alchemy of common sense can transmute some part of it into good So he
coined the smiles which the king shed upon his wifehe being
powerless to prevent for Edward smiled where he listed and listed
nearly everywhereinto nobles crowns and pounds sterling and left a
glorious fortune to his son and to his sons son unto about the
fourth generation which was a ripe old age for a fortune I think
How few of them live beyond the second and fewer still beyond the
third It was during the third generation of this fortune that the
events of the following history occurred
Now it has been the custom of the Caskodens for centuries to keep a
record of events as they have happened both private and public Some
are in the form of diaries and journals like those of Pepys and
Evelyn others in letters like the Pastons others again in verse and
song like Chaucers and the Water Poets and still others in the
more pretentious form of memoir and chronicle These records we always
have kept jealously within our family thinking it vulgar like the
Pastons to submit our private affairs to public gaze
There can however be no reason why those parts treating solely of
outside matters should be so carefully guarded and I have determined
to choose for publication such portions as do not divulge family
secrets nor skeletons and which really redound to family honor
For this occasion I have selected from the memoir of my worthy
ancestor and namesake Sir Edwin Caskodengrandson of the goldsmith
and Master of the Dance to Henry VIIIthe story of Charles Brandon
and Mary Tudor sister to the king
This story is so well known to the student of English history that I
fear its repetition will lack that zest which attends the development
of an unforeseen denouement But it is of so great interest and is so
full in its sweet fierce manifestation of the one thing insoluble
by time Love that I will nevertheless rewrite it from old Sir
Edwins memoir Not so much as an historical narrative although I
fear a little history will creep in despite me but simply as a
picture of that olden long ago which try as we will to put aside the
hazy manyfolded curtain of time still retains its shadowy lack of
sharp detail toning down and mellowing the hard aspect of real
lifeharder and more unromantic even than our owninto the blending
softness of an exquisite mirage
I might give you the exact words in which Sir Edwin wrote and shall
now and then quote from contemporaneous chronicles in the language of
his time but should I so write at all I fear the pleasure of perusal
would but poorly pay for the trouble as the English of the Bluff King
is almost a foreign tongue to us I shall therefore with a few
exceptions give Sir Edwins memoir in words spelling and idiom which
his rollicking little old shade will probably repudiate as none of his
whatsoever So if you happen to find sixteenth century thought
hobnobbing in the same sentence with nineteenth century English be
not disturbed I did it If the little old fellow grows grandiloquent
or garrulous at timeshe did that If you find him growing
supersentimental remember that sentimentalism was the lifebreath of
chivalry just then approaching its absurdest climax in the bombastic
conscientiousness of Bayard and the whole mental atmosphere laden with
its pompous nonsense
CHAPTER I
The Duel
It sometimes happens Sir Edwin says that when a woman will she
wont and when she wont she will but usually in the end the adage
holds good That sentence may not be luminous with meaning but I will
give you an illustration
I think it was in the spring of 1509 at any rate soon after the death
of the Modern Solomon as Queen Catherine called her old
fatherinlaw the late King Henry VII that his august majesty Henry
VIII The Vndubitate Flower and very Heire of both the sayd Linages
came to the throne of England and tendered me the honorable position
of Master of the Dance at his sumptuous court
As to worldly goods as some of the new religionists call wealth I
was very comfortably off having inherited from my father one of the
counselors of Henry VII a very competent fortune indeed How my
worthy father contrived to save from the greedy hand of that rich old
miser so great a fortune I am sure I can not tell He was the only
man of my knowledge who did it for the old king had a reach as long
as the kingdom and upon one pretext or another appropriated to
himself everything on which he could lay his hands My father
however was himself pretty shrewd in money matters having inherited
along with his fortune a rare knack at keeping it His father was a
goldsmith in the time of King Edward and enjoyed the marked favor of
that puissant prince
Being thus in a position of affluence I cared nothing for the fact
that little or no emolument went with the office it was the honor
which delighted me Besides I was thereby an inmate of the kings
palace and brought into intimate relations with the court and above
all with the finest ladies of the landthe best company a man can
keep since it ennobles his mind with better thoughts purifies his
heart with cleaner motives and makes him gentle without detracting
from his strength It was an office any lord of the kingdom might have
been proud to hold
Now some four or five years after my induction into this honorable
office there came to court news of a terrible duel fought down in
Suffolk out of which only one of the four combatants had come
alivetwo rather but one of them in a condition worse than death
The first survivor was a son of Sir William Brandon and the second
was a man called Sir Adam Judson The story went that young Brandon
and his elder brother both just home from the continental wars had
met Judson at an Ipswich inn where there had been considerable
gambling among them Judson had won from the brothers a large sum of
money which they had brought home for notwithstanding their youth
the elder being but twentysix and the younger about twentyfour years
of age they had gained great honor and considerable profit in wars
especially the younger whose name was Charles
It is a little hard to fight for money and then to lose it by a single
spot upon the die but such is the fate of him who plays and a
philosopher will swallow his ill luck and take to fighting for more
The Brandons could have done this easily enough especially Charles
who was an offhand philosopher rather fond of a goodhumored fight
had it not been that in the course of play one evening the secret of
Judsons winning had been disclosed by a discovery that he cheated
The Brandons waited until they were sure and then trouble began
which resulted in a duel on the second morning following
This Judson was a Scotch gentleman of whom very little was known
except that he was counted the most deadly and most cruel duelist of
the time He was called the Walking Death and it is said took pride
in the appellation He boasted that he had fought eightyseven duels
in which he had killed seventyfive men and it was considered certain
death to meet him I got the story of the duel afterwards from Brandon
as I give it here
John was the elder brother and when the challenge came was entitled
to fight firsta birthright out of which Charles tried in vain to
talk him The brothers told their father Sir William Brandon and at
the appointed time father and sons repaired to the place of meeting
where they found Judson and his two seconds ready for the fight
Sir William was still a vigorous man with few equals in sword play
and the sons especially the younger were better men and more skilful
than their father had ever been yet they felt that this duel meant
certain death so great was Judsons fame for skill and cruelty
Notwithstanding they were so handicapped with this feeling of
impending evil they met their duty without a tremor for the motto of
their house was Malo Mori Quam Fedrai
It was a misty morning in March Brandon has told me since that when
his elder brother took his stand it was at once manifest that he was
Judsons superior both in strength and skill but after a few strokes
the brothers blade bent double and broke off short at the hilt when
it should have gone home Thereupon Judson with a malignant smile of
triumph deliberately selected his opponents heart and pierced it
with his sword giving the blade a twist as he drew it out in order to
cut and mutilate the more
In an instant Sir Williams doublet was off and he was in his dead
sons tracks ready to avenge him or to die Again the thrust which
should have killed broke the sword and the father died as the son had
died
After this came young Charles expecting but so great was his
strong heart not one whit fearing to lie beside his dead father and
brother He knew he was the superior of both in strength and skill
and his knowledge of men and the noble art told him they had each been
the superior of Judson but the fellows hand seemed to be the hand of
death An opening came through Judsons unskilful play which gave
young Brandon an opportunity for a thrust to kill but his blade like
his fathers and brothers bent double without penetrating Unlike
the others however it did not break and the thrust revealed the
fact that Judsons skill as a duelist lay in a shirt of mail which it
was useless to try to pierce Aware of this Brandon knew that victory
was his and that soon he would have avenged the murders that had gone
before He saw that his adversary was strong neither in wind nor arm
and had not the skill to penetrate his guard in a weeks trying so he
determined to fight on the defensive until Judsons strength should
wane and then kill him when and how he chose
After a time Judson began to breathe hard and his thrusts to lack
force
Boy I would spare you he said I have killed enough of your
tribe put up your sword and call it quits
Young Brandon replied Stand your ground you coward you will be a
dead man as soon as you grow a little weaker if you try to run I will
thrust you through the neck as I would a cur Listen how you snort I
shall soon have you you are almost gone You would spare me would
you I could preach a sermon or dance a hornpipe while I am killing
you I will not break my sword against your coat of mail but will
wait until you fall from weakness and then Fight you bloodhound
Judson was pale from exhaustion and his breath was coming in gasps as
he tried to keep the merciless sword from his throat At last by a
dexterous twist of his blade Brandon sent Judsons sword flying
thirty feet away The fellow started to run but turned and fell upon
his knees to beg for life Brandons reply was a flashing circle of
steel and his sword point cut lengthwise through Judsons eyes and
the bridge of his nose leaving him sightless and hideous for life A
revenge compared to which death would have been merciful
The duel created a sensation throughout the kingdom for although
little was known as to who Judson was his fame as a duelist was as
broad as the land He had been at court upon several occasions and
at one time upon the kings birthday had fought in the royal lists
So the matter came in for its share of consideration by king and
courtiers and young Brandon became a person of interest He became
still more so when some gentlemen who had served with him in the
continental wars told the court of his daring and bravery and related
stories of deeds at arms worthy of the best knight in Christendom
He had an uncle at the court Sir Thomas Brandon the kings Master of
Horse who thought it a good opportunity to put his nephew forward
and let him take his chance at winning royal favor The uncle broached
the subject to the king with favorable issue and Charles Brandon
led by the hand of fate came to London Court where that same fate
had in keeping for him events such as seldom fall to the lot of man
CHAPTER II
How Brandon Came to Court
When we learned that Brandon was coming to court every one believed
he would soon gain the kings favor How much that would amount to
none could tell as the kings favorites were of many sorts and taken
from all conditions of men There was Master Wolsey a butchers son
whom he had first made almoner then chief counselor and Bishop of
Lincoln soon to be Bishop of York and Cardinal of the Holy Roman
Church
From the other extreme of life came young Thomas Lord Howard heir to
the Earl of Surrey and my Lord of Buckingham premier peer of the
realm Then sometimes would the king take a yeoman of the guard and
make him his companion in jousts and tournaments solely because of
his brawn and bone There were others whom he kept close by him in the
palace because of their wit and the entertainment they furnished of
which class was I and I flatter myself no mean member
To begin with being in no way dependent on the king for money I
never drew a farthing from the royal treasury This you may be sure
did me no harm for although the king sometimes delighted to give
he always hated to pay There were other good reasons too why I
should be a favorite with the king Without meaning to be vain I
think I may presume to say with perfect truth that my conversation
and manners were far more pleasing and polished than were usual at
that day in England for I made it a point to spend several weeks each
year in the noble French capital the home and center of goodbreeding
and politeness
My appointment as Master of the Dance I am sure was owing entirely
to my manner My brother the baron who stood high with the king was
not friendly toward me because my father had seen fit to bequeath me
so good a competency in place of giving it all to the firstborn and
leaving me dependent upon the tender mercies of an elder brother So I
had no help from him nor from any one else I was quite small of
stature and therefore unable to compete with lance and mace with
bulkier men but I would bet with any man of any size on any game
at any place and time in any amount and if I do say it who perhaps
should not I basked in the light of many a fair smile which larger
men had sighed for in vain
I did not know when Brandon first came to London We had all remained
at Greenwich while the king went up to Westminster to waste his time
with matters of state and quarrel with the Parliament then sitting
over the amount of certain subsidies
Mary the kings sister then some eighteen or nineteen years of age
a perfect bud just blossoming into a perfect flower had gone over to
Windsor on a visit to her elder sister Margaret of Scotland and the
palace was dull enough Brandon it seems had been presented to Henry
during this time at Westminster and had to some extent at least
become a favorite before I met him The first time I saw him was at a
joust given by the king at Westminster in celebration of the fact
that he had coaxed a good round subsidy out of Parliament
The queen and her ladies had been invited over and it was known that
Mary would be down from Windsor and come home with the king and the
court to Greenwich when we should return So we all went over to
Westminster the night before the jousts and were up bright and early
next morning to see all that was to be seen
Here the editor sees fit to substitute a description of this
tournament taken from the quaint old chronicler Hall
The morow beyng after dynner at tyme conuenenient the Quene with
her Ladyes repaired to see the Iustes the trompettes blewe vp
and in came many a noble man and Gentleman rychely appeareiled
takynge vp thir horses after whome folowed certayne lordes
appareiled they and thir horses in cloth of Golde and russet and
tynsell Knyghtes in cloth of Golde and russet Veluet And a
greate nomber of Gentlemen on fote in russet satyn and yealow
and yomen in russet Damaske and yealow all the nether parte of
euery mans hosen Skarlet and yealow cappes
Then came the kynge vnder a Pauilion of golde and purpul Veluet
embroudered the compass of the Pauilion about and valenced with
a flat gold beaten in wyre with an Imperiall croune in the top
of fyne Golde his bases and trapper of cloth of Golde fretted
with Damask Golde the trapper pedant to the tail A crane and
chafron of stele in the front of the chafro was a goodly plume
set full of musers or trimbling spangles of golde After folowed
his three aydes euery of them vnder a Pauilion of Crymosyn
Damaske  purple The nomber of Gentlemen and yomen a fote
appareiled in russet and yealow was clxviii Then next these
Pauilions came xii chyldren of honor sitting euery one of them on
a greate courser rychely trapped and embroudered in seuerall
deuises and facions where lacked neither brouderie nor
goldsmythes work so that euery chyld and horse in deuice and
fascion was contrary to the other which was goodly to beholde
Then on the counter parte entered a Straunger fyrst on
horsebacke in a long robe of Russet satyne like a recluse or a
religious and his horse trapped in the same sewte without dromme
or noyse of mynstrelsye puttinge a byll of peticion to the Quene
the effect whereof was that if it would please her to license hym
to runne in her presence he would do it gladly and if not then
he would departe as he came After his request was graunted then
he put off hys sayd habyte and was armed at all peces with ryche
bases  horse also rychely trapped and so did runne his horse to
the tylte end where dieurs men on fote appareiled in Russet satyn
awaited on him Thereupon the Heraulds cryed an Oyez and the
grownd shoke with the trompe of rushynge stedes Wonder it were to
write of the dedes of Armes which that day toke place where a man
might haue seen many a horse raysed on highe with galop turne and
stoppe maruaylous to behold Cxiv staves were broke and the
kynge being lusty he and the straunger toke the prices
When the queen had given the stranger permission to run and as he
moved away there was a great clapping of hands and waving of
trophies among the ladies for he was of such noble mien and comely
face as to attract the gaze of every one away from even the glittering
person of his majesty the king
His hair worn in its natural length fell in brown curls back from
his forehead almost to the shoulder a style just then new even in
France His eyes were a deep blue and his complexion though browned
by exposure held a tinge of beauty which the sun could not mar and a
girl might envy He wore neither mustachio nor beard as men now
disfigure their facessince Francis I took a scar on his chinand
his clear cut profile dilating nostrils and mobile though firmset
mouth gave pleasing assurance of tenderness gentleness daring and
strength
I was standing near the queen who called to me Who is the handsome
stranger that so gracefully asked our license to run
I can not inform your majesty I never saw him until now He is the
goodliest knight I have ever beheld
That he is replied the queen and we should like very much to know
him Should we not ladies There was a chorus of assent from a dozen
voices and I promised after the running to learn all about him and
report
It was at this point the heralds cried their Oyes and our
conversation was at an end for the time
As to height the stranger was full six feet with ample evidence of
muscle though no great bulk He was grace itself and the king
afterwards said he had never seen such strength of arm and skill in
the use of the lancea sure harbinger of favor if not of fortune
for the possessor
After the jousting the Princess Mary asked me if I could yet give her
an account of the stranger and as I could not she went to the king
I heard her inquire
Who was your companion brother
That is a secret sister You will find out soon enough and will be
falling in love with him no doubt I have always looked upon you as
full of trouble for me in that respect you will not so much as glance
at anyone I choose for you but I suppose would be ready enough with
your smiles for some one I should not want
Is the stranger one whom you would not want asked Mary with a
dimpling smile and a flash of her brown eyes
He most certainly is returned the king
Then I will fall in love with him at once In fact I dont know but
I have already
Oh I have no doubt of that if I wanted him he might be Apollo
himself and you would have none of him King Henry had been compelled
to refuse several very advantageous alliances because this fair
coaxing selfwilled sister would not consent to be a part of the
moving consideration
But can you not tell me who he is and what his degree went on Mary
in a bantering tone
He has no degree he is a plain untitled soldier not even a knight
that is not an English knight I think he has a German or Spanish
order of some sort
Not a duke not an earl not even a baron or knight Now he has
become interesting
Yes I suppose so but dont bother me
Will he be at the dance and banquet tonight
No No Now I must go dont bother me I say And the king moved
away
That night we had a grand banquet and dance at Westminster and the
next day we all excepting Lady Mary went back to Greenwich by boat
paying a farthing a head for our fare This was just after the law
fixing the boat fare and the watermen were a quarreling lot you may
be sure One farthing from Westminster to Greenwich Eight miles No
wonder they were angry
The next day I went back to London on an errand and over to Wolseys
house to borrow a book While there Master Cavendish Wolseys
secretary presented me to the handsome stranger and he proved to be
no other than Charles Brandon who had fought the terrible duel down
in Suffolk I could hardly believe that so mildmannered and boyish a
person could have taken the leading part in such a tragedy But with
all his gentleness there was an underlying dash of cool daring which
intimated plainly enough that he was not all mildness
We became friends at once drawn together by that subtle human quality
which makes one nature fit into another resulting in friendship
between men and love between men and women We soon found that we had
many tastes in common chief among which was the strongest of all
congenial bonds the love of books In fact we had come to know each
other through our common love of reading for he also had gone to
Master Cavendish who had a fine library to borrow some volumes to
take with him down to Greenwich
Brandon informed me he was to go to Greenwich that day so we
determined to see a little of London which was new to him and then
take boat in time to be at the palace before dark
That evening upon arriving at Greenwich we hunted up Brandons
uncle the Master of Horse who invited his nephew to stay with him
for the night He refused however and accepted an invitation to take
a bed in my room
The next day Brandon was installed as one of the captains of the
kings guard under his uncle but with no particular duties except
such as should be assigned him from time to time He was offered a
good room on one of the lower floors but asked instead to be lodged
in the attic next to me So we arranged that each had a room opening
into a third that served us alike for drawingroom and armory
Here we sat and talked and now and then one would read aloud some
favorite passage while the other kept his own place with finger
between the leaves Here we discussed everything from court scandal to
religion and settled to our own satisfaction at least many a great
problem with which the foolish world is still wrestling
We told each other all our secrets too for all the world like a pair
of girls Although Brandon had seen so much of life having fought on
the continent ever since he was a boy and for all he was so much a
man of the world yet had he as fresh and boyish a heart as if he had
just come from the clover fields and daisies He seemed almost
diffident but I soon learned that his manner was but the cool
gentleness of strength
Of what use let me ask is a friend unless you can unload your heart
upon him It matters not whether the load be joy or sorrow if the
former the need is all the greater for joy has an expansive power
as some persons say steam has and must escape from the heart upon
some one else
So Brandon told me of his hopes and aspirations chief among which was
his desire to earn and save enough money to pay the debt against his
fathers estate which he had turned over to his younger brother and
sisters He as the eldest could have taken it all for his father
had died without a will but he said there was not enough to divide
so he had given it to them and hoped to leave it clear of debt then
for New Spain glory and fortune conquest and yellow gold He had
read of the voyages of the great Columbus the Cabots and a host of
