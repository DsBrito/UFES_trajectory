This story when I found it sandwiched between Jane Somebodys
Impressions Upon Seeing an Italian Hedge and three verses entitled
Resurgam or something like that I straightway bore to Blister
Jones horsetrainer by profession and gentleman by instinct
What that guy dont know about a hoss would fill a book was his
comment after I had read him the story
I rather agreed with this opinion and sohere is the book
THE THOROUGHBRED
Lead him awayhis day is done
His satin coat and velvet eye
Are dimmed as moonlight in the sun
Is lost upon the sky
Lead him awayhis rival stands
A calf of shiny gold
His masters kneel with lifted hands
To this base thing and bold
Lead him awayfar down the past
Where sentiment has fled
But gentlemen just at the last
Drink deepthe thoroughbred

BLISTER JONES
BLISTER
How my oldyoung friend Blister Jones acquired his remarkable
nickname I learned one cloudless morning late in June
Our chairs were tipped against number 84 in the curving line of
boxstalls at Latonia  Down the sweep of whitewashed stalls the upper
doors were yawning wide and from many of these openings velvet black
in the sunlight sleek snaky heads protruded
My head rested in the center of the lower door of 84  From time to
time a warm moist breath accompanied by a gigantic sigh would play
against the back of my neck or my hat would be pushed a bit farther
over my eyes by a wrinkling muzzlefor Tambourine gazing out into the
green of the centerfield felt a vague longing and wished to tell me
about it
The track a broad tawny ribbon with a lacework edging of white fence
was before us the upperturn with its striped fiveeighths pole not
fifty feet away  Some men came and set up the starting device at this
red and white pole and I asked Blister to explain to me just what it
meant
Goin to school twoyearolds at the barrier he explained  And
presentlymincing sidling making futile leaps to get away the boys
on their backs standing clear above them in the short stirrupsa band
of deerlike young thoroughbreds assembled thirty feet or so from the
barrier
Then there was trouble  Those sweet young things performed with the
rapidity of thought every lawless act known to the equine brain  They
reared  They plunged  They bucked  They spun  They surged together
They scattered like startled quail  I heard squeals and saw vicious
shiny hoofs lash out in every direction and the dust spun a yellow
haze over it all
Those jockeys will be killed  I gasped
Jockeys exclaimed Blister contemptuously  Them aint
jockeystheyre exerciseboys  Do you think a jock would school a
twoyearold
A man who Blister said was a trainer stood on the fence and acted as
starter  Language came from this person in volcanic blasts and the
seething mass where infant education was brewing boiled and boiled
again
That bay fillys a nicelookin trick Four Eyes said Blister
pointing out a twoyearold standing somewhat apart from the rest
Shes by Hamilton n her dams Alberta by Seminole
The bay filly I soon observed had more than beautyshe was so
obviously the outcome of a splendid and selected ancestry  Even her
manners were aristocratic  She faced the barrier with quiet dignity
and took no part in the whirling riot except to move disdainfully aside
when it threatened to engulf her  I turned to Blister and found him
gazing at the filly with a faraway look in his eyes
Ole Alberta was a grand mare he said presently  I see her get away
last in the Crescent City Derby n be ten lenths back at the quarter
But she come from nowhere collared ole Stonebrook in the stretch
looked him in the eye the last eighth n outgamed him at the wire
She has a hundred n thirty pounds up at that
Ole Alberta dies when she has this filly he went on after a pause
Judge Dillon over near Lexington owned her n Mrs Dillon brings
the filly up on the bottle  See how nice that filly stands  Handled
every day since she was foaled n never had a cross word  Sugar
every mawnin from Mrs Dillon  Thats way to learn a colt somethin
At last the colts were formed into a disorderly line
Now boys youve got a chancecome on with em bellowed the
starter  Not too fast    he cautioned  Awlrrright    let
em goo
They were off like rockets as the barrier shot up and the bay filly
flashed into the lead  Her slender legs seemed to bear her as though
on the breast of the wind  She did not runshe floatedyet the gap
between herself and her struggling schoolmates grew ever wider
Oh you Alberta breathed Blister  Then his tone changed  Most of
these wise Ikes talk about the sire of a colt but Ill take a good dam
all the time for mine
Standing on my chair I watched the colts finish their run the filly
well in front
Shes a wonder I exclaimed resuming my seat
She acts like shell deliver the goods Blister conceded  Shes got
a lot of step but it takes moren that to make a race hoss  Well
know about her when she goes the route carryin weight against
class
The colts were now being led to their quarters by stableboys  When
the boy leading the winner passed he threw us a triumphant smile
I guess shes bad he opined
Some baby Blister admitted  Then with disgust Theyve hung a
fierce name on her though
Aint it the truth agreed the boy
What is her name I asked when the pair had gone by
They call her Trez Jolly said Blister  Now aint that a hell of a
name  I like a name you can kinda warble  He had pronounced the
French phrase exactly as it is written with an effort at the J
following the sibilant
Tres Jolieits French I explained and gave him the meaning and
proper pronunciation
Traysyolee he repeated after me  Say Im a rube right
Traaysyolee in the stretch byanoose he intoned with gusto  You
can warble that he exclaimed
I dont think much of Blisterfor beauty I said  Of course that
isnt your real name
No I had another once he replied evasively  But I never hears it
much  The old woman calls me thatdambrat n the old man the same
only more so  I gets Blister handed to me by the bunch one winter at
the New Awlin meetin
How I inquired
Wait till I get the makins n Ill tell you he said as he got up
and entered a stall
One winter Im swipin fur Jameson he began when he returned with
tobacco and papers  We ships to New Awlins early that fall  We have
twelve dogshalf of em hopheads n the other half dinks
In them days I aint much bigger n a peanut but I sure thinks Im a
clever guy  I figger they aint a gazabo on the track can hand it to
me
One mawnin theres a bunch of us ginnies settin on the fence at the
wire watchin the workouts  Some trainers n owners is standin on
the track ragchewin
A bird owned by Cal Davis is finishin a milenaquarter under
wraps in scanlous fast time  Cal is standin at the finish with his
clock in his hand lookin real contented  All of a sudden the bird
makes a stagger goes to his knees n chucks the boy over his head
His swipe runs out n grabs the bird n leads him in alimpin
Say  That birds rightfront tendon is bowed like a barrel stave
This Cal Davis is a big owner  Hes got all kinds of kalen he
dont fool with dinks  He gives one look at the bowed tendon
Anybody thatll lead this hoss off the track gets him n a months
feed he says
Before you could spit I has that bird by the head  His swipe aint
goin to let go of him but Cal says Turn him loose boy  N Im
on my way with the bird
Thats the first one I ever owns  Jameson loans me a stall fur him
That night a ginnie comes over from Cals barn with two bags of oats in
a wheelbarrow
A newspaper guy finds out about the deal n writes it up so
everybody is hep to me playin owner  One day I see the starter point
me out to Colonel King whos the main squeeze in the judges stand
n they both laugh
Ive got all winter before we has to ship n believe me I sweat some
over this bird  I done everythin to that tendon except make a new
one  In a month I has it in such shape he dont limp n I begins to
stick mile gallops n short breezers into him  He has to wear a stiff
bandage on the dinky leg n I puts one on the leftfore tooit
looks better
It aint so long till I has this bird cherry ripe  Hell take aholt
awful strong right at the end of a stiff mile  One day I turns him
loose fur threeeighths n he runs it so fast he makes me dizzy
I know hes good but I wants to know how good before I pays
entrance on him  I dont want the clockers to get wise to him neither
Joe Nickels the star jock that year  Ive seen many a good boy on a
hoss but I think Joes the best judge of pace I ever see  One day
hes comin from the weighinroom still in his silks  His valets
with him carryin the saddle  I steps up n says
Kin I see you private a minute Joe
Sure thing kid he says  N the valet skidoos
Joe I says Ive got a bird thats right  I dont know just how
good he is but hes awful good  I want to get wise to him before I
crowds my dough on to the Sociation  Will you give him a work
It takes an awful nerve to ask a jock like Nickel to work a hoss out
but hes the only one can judge pace good enough to put me wise n
Im desperate
Its that Davis cripple aint it he asks
Thats him I says
He studies a minute lookin steady at me
Im your huckleberry he says at last  When do you want me
Just as she gets light tomorrow mawnin I says quick fur I hasnt
believed hed come through n I wants to stick the gaff into him
fore he changes his mind
He give a sigh  I knowed he was no early riser
All right he says  Wherell you be
At the halfmile post I says  Ill have him warmed up fur you
All right he says againn that night I dont sleep none
When it begins to get a little gray next mawnin I takes the bird out
n gallops him a slow mile with a stiff breezer at the end  But
durin the night I gives up thinkin Joell be there n I nearly
falls off when I comes past the halfmile post n hes standin by
the fence in a classy overcoat n kid gloves
He takes off his overcoat n comes up when I gets downn gives a
look at the saddle
I cant ride nothin on that thing he says  Slip over to the
jocks room n get mine  Its on number three pegheres the key
Its gettin light fast n Im afraid of the clockers
The sharpshootersll be out in a minute I says
I cant help it says Joe  I wouldnt ride a bull on that saddle
I see theres no use to argue so I beats it across the centerfield
cops the saddle n comes back  I run all the way but its gettin
awful light
Send him a mile in fortyfive n see what hes got left I says as
I throws Joe up
Right in the notchif hes got the step he says
I click Jamesons clock on them as they went awayJoe whisperin in
the birds ear  The backstretch was the stretch startin from the
half  I seen the birds mouth wide open as they come home n Joe has
double wraps on him  He wont beat fifty under that pull I says to
myself  But when I stops the clock at the finish it was at
fortyfournthreequarters  Joe aint got a clock to go by
neitherthats judgin pacetake it from me
Hes diseased with speed says Joe when he gets down  He can do
thirtyeight surejust look at my hands
I does a dance abowin to the bird n Joe stands there laughin at
me squeezin the blood back into his mitts
We leads the hoss to the gate n theres a bookys clocker named
Izzy Goldberg
You an exerciseboy now he asks Joe
Not yet says Joe  Mu cousin here owns this trick n Im givin
him a work
Up kinda early aint you  Say  Hes good aint he Joe says
Izzy n looks at the bird close
Naw hes a mutt says Joe
Whats he doin with his mouth open at the end of that mile Izzy
says n laughs
He only runs it in fifty says Joe careless  I takes hold of him
cause hes bad in front n hes likely to do a flop when he gets
tired  So long Bud Joe says to me n I takes the bird to the barn
Im not thinkin Izzy aint wise  Its a cinch Joe dont stall him
Every booky would hear about that workout by noon  Sure enough the
Items pink sheet has this among the tips the next day
Count Noblethat was the birds namea mile in fortyfour
Pulled to a walk at the end  Bet the works on him his first time out
boys
That was on a Saturday  On Monday I enters the bird among a bunch of
dogs to start in a five furlong sprint Thursday  Im savin every
soomarkee I gets my hands on n I pays the entrance to the secretary
like its a mere bag of shells  Joe Nickel cant ride fur mehes
under contract  I meets him the day before my race
Youre levelin with your hoss aint you he says  Ill send my
valet in with you n after you get yours on hell bet two hundred
fur me
Nothin doin Joe I says  Stay away from it  Ill tell you when
I gets ready to level  You cant bet them bookies nothintheyre
wise to him
Lookahere Bud says Joe  That birdll cakewalk among them
crabs  No jock can make him lose n not get ruled off
Leave that to me I says
Just as I figgersmy hoss opens up eighttofive in the books
I gives him all the water hell drink afore he goes to the post n I
has bandages on every leg  The paddock judge looks at them bandages
but he knows the birds a cripple n he dont feel em
Thems to hold his legs on aint they he says n grins
Surest thing you know I says  But I feels some easier when hes on
his waytheres seven pounds of lead in each of them bandages
I dont want the bird whipped when he aint got a chance
This hoss backs up if you use the bat on him I says to the jock as
hes tyin his reins
He backs up anyway I guess he says as the parade starts
The bird gets away good but Id overdone the lead in his socks  He
finished a nasty lastthirty lenths back
Roll over kid says the jock when I go up to slip him his fee
Not fur ridin that hippo  It ud be buglaryhe couldnt beat a
piano
I meets Colonel King comin out of the judges stand that evenin
An owners life has its trials and tribulationseh my boy he says
Yes sir I says  Thats the first time Colonel King ever speaks to
me n I swells up like a toad  Im gettin to be all the gravy
round here I says to myself
Two days after this they puts an overnight mile run fur maidens on the
card n I slips the bird into it  I knowed it was takin a chance so
soon after his bad race but it looks so soft I cant stay way from
it  I goes to Cal Davis n tells him to put a bet down
Oh ho he says  Lendin me a helpin hand are you  Then I
tells him about Nickel
Did Joe Nickel work him out for you he says  The best is good
enough fur you aint it  Ill see Joe n if it looks good to him
Ill take a shot at it  Much obliged to you
Dont never mention it I says
How do you mean that he says grinnin
Both ways says I
The mawnin of the race Im givin the birds bad leg a steamin
when a black swipe named Duckfoot Johnson tells me Im wanted on the
phone over to the secretarys office n I gets Duckfoot to go on
steamin the leg while Im gone
Its a feed man on the phone wantin to know when he gets sixteen
bucks I owe him
The birdll bring home your coin at four oclock this afternoon I
tells him
Well thats lucky he says  I thought it was throwed to the
birds n I didnt figure theyd bring it home again
When I gets back theres a crap game goin on in front of the stall
n Duckfoots shootin  Theres a hot towel on the birds leg n
its been there too long  I takes it off n feel where small blisters
has begun to raise under the haira little more n it ud been clear
to the bone  I cusses Duckfoot good n rubs vaseline into the leg
I interrupted Blister long enough to inquire
Dont they blister horses sometimes to cure them of lameness
Sure he replied  But a hoss dont work none fur quite a spell
afterwards  A blister to do any good fixes him so he cant hardly
raise his leg fur two weeks
Well he went on the race fur maidens was the last thing on the
card  Im in the bettingring when they chalks up the first odds n
my hoss opens at twentyfivetoone  The two entrance moneys have
about cleaned me  Im only twenty green men strong  I peels off ten
of em n shoved up to a booky
On the nose fur that one I says pointin to the birds name
Quit your kiddin he says  What ud you do with all that money
This fur yours  N he rubs to twelvetoone
Aint you the liberal gink I says as he hands me the ticket
I starts fur the next book but saythe odds is just meltin away
Joes n Cals dough is comin down the line n the gazabos
thinkin its wise money trails  By posttime the birds a
onetothree shot
Ive give the mount to Sweeney n like a nut I puts him hep to the
bird n he tells his valet to bet a hundred fur him  The bird has on
socks again but this time theyre empty n the race was a joke  He
breaks fifth at the getaway but he just mows them dogs down  Sweeney
keeps thinkin about that hundred I guess cause he rode the bird all
the way n finished a million lenths in front
I cashes my ticket n starts fur the barn to sleep with that bird
when here comes Joe Nickel
He run a nice race he says grinnin n hands me six hundred
bucks
Whats this fur I says  You better be careful    I got a weak
heart
I win twelve hundred to the race he says  N we splits it two
ways
Nothin doin I says n tries to hand him back the wad
Go awn he says Ill give you a soak in the ear  I bet that money
fur you kiddo
I looks at the roll n gets wobbly in the knees  I never see so much
kale beforenot at one time  Just then we hears the announcer sing
out through a megaphone
The ooowner of Count Nobullll is wanted in the judges stand
Oy oy says Joe  Youll need that kaleyoure goin to lose your
happy home  Its Katy bar the door fur yours Bud
Dont worrywatch me tell it to em I says to Joe as I stuffs the
roll n starts fur the stand  I was feelin purty good
Wait a minute says Joe runnin after me  You cant tell them
people nothin  You aint wise to that bunch yet  Budwhy theyll
kid you silly before they hand it to you n then change the subject
to somethin interestin like where to get pompono cooked to suit em
Ive been up against it he says n Im tellin you right  Just
keep stallin around when you get in the stand n act like you dont
know the wars over
Furget it I says  Ill show those big stiffs where to head in
Ill hypnotize the old owls  Ill give em a song n dance thats
right
As I goes up the steps I see the judges settin in their chairs n I
takes off my hat  Colonel King aint settin hes standin up with
his hands in his pockets  Somehow when I sees him I begins to
wilthe looks so clean  Hes got a white mustache n his face is
kinda brown n pink  He looks at me a minute out of them blue eyes
of his
Are you the owner of Count Noble Mrer
Jones sir I says
Jones says the colonel
Yes sir I says
Mr Jones says the colonel how do you account for the fact that
on Thursday Count Noble performs disgracefully and on Saturday runs
like a stake horse  Have the days of the week anything to do with it
I never says nothin  I just stands there lookin at him foolin
with my hat
This is hell I thinks
The judges are interested in this phenomenon Mr Jones and we have
sent for you thinking perhaps you can throw a little light on the
matter says the colonel n waits fur me again
Come on    get busy I says to myself  You can kid along with a
bunch of bums n it sounds gooddont get cold feet the first time
some class opens his bazoo at you  But I cant make a noise like a
word on a bet
The judges upon looking over the betting sheets of the two races in
which your horse appeared find them quite interesting says the
colonel  The odds were short in the race he did not win they
remained unchangedin fact rosesince only a small amount was
wagered on his chances  On the other hand these facts are reversed in
todays race which he won  It seems possible that you and your
friends who were pessimists on Thursday became optimists today and
benefited by the change  Have you done so
I see I has to get some sorta language out of me
He was a better hoss todaythats all I knows about it I says
The first part of your statement seems well within the facts says
the colonel  He was apparently a much better horse today  But
these gentlemen and myself having the welfare of the American
thoroughbred at heart would be glad to learn by what method he was so
greatly improved
I dont know why I ever does it but it comes to me how Duckfoot
leaves the towel on the birds leg n I dont stop to think
I blistered him I says
Youwhat says the colonel  Id have give up the roll quick
soonern spit it out again but Im up against it
I blisters him I says
The colonels face gets red  His eyes bung out n he turns round
n starts to cough n make noises  The rest of them judges does the
same  They holds on to each other n does it  I know theyre givin
me the laugh fur that fierce break I makes
Youre outclassed kid I says to myself  Theyll tie a can to
you sure  The gate fur yours
Just then Colonel King turns round n I see I cant look at him no
more  I looks at my hat waitin fur him to say Im ruled off  Ive
got a lump in my throat n I think its a bunch of bright
conversation stuck there  But just then a chunk of water rolls out of
my eye n hits my hatpow  It looks biggern Lake Erie n fore I
kin jerk the hat awaypowcomes another one  I knows the colonel
sees em n I hopes I croak
Ahem he says
Now I get mine I says to myself
Mr Jones says the colonel n his voice is kinda cheerful  The
judges will accept your explanation  You may go if you wish
Just as Im goin down the steps the colonel stops me
I have a piece of advice for you Mr Jones he says  His voice
aint cheerful neither  It goes right into my gizzard  I turns and
looks at him  Keep that horse blistered from now on says the
colonel
Some ginnies is in the weighinroom under the stand n hears it
all  Thats how I gets my name
TWO RINGERS
Hello ole Four Eyes was the semiaffectionate greeting of Blister
Jones  I aint seed you lately
I had found him in the blacksmith shop at Latonia lazily observing the
smiths efforts to unite Fan Tan and a set of newmade blueblack
racingplates  I explained how a city editor had bowed my shoulders
with the labors of Hercules during the last week and began to acquire
knowledge of the uncertainties connected with shoeing a young
thoroughbred
A colored stableboy stood at Fan Tans wickedlooking head and
addressed in varied tone and temper a pair of flattened ears
Whoa  Babydoll  Dats ma honeydats ma petty chile     Whoa
Yuh nocoun houn yuh  The first of the speech had been delivered
soothingly as the smith succeeded in getting a reluctant hind leg into
his lap the last was snorted out as the leg straightened suddenly and
catapulted him into a corner of the shop where he sat down heavily
among some discarded horseshoes
The smith arose sweat and curses dripping from him
Chris said Blister its a shame the way you treat that pore filly
She comes into yer dirty joint like a little lady fur to get a new
pair of shoes n you grabs her by the leg n then cusses her when
she wont stand fur it
Part of the curses were now directed at Blister
Come on Four Eyes he said  This aint no place fur a ministers
son
Id like to stay and see the shoeing I protested as he rose to go
What shoeing he asked incredulously  You aint meanin a big
strong guy like Chris manhandlin a pore little filly  Come awnI
cant stand to see him abusin her no more
We wandered down to the big brown oval and Blister perching himself
on the top rail of the fence took out his stopwatch although there
were no horses on the track
What are you going to do with that I asked
Got to do it he grinned  If I was to set on a track fence without
ma clock in my mitt Id get so nurrvous  Purty soon Id be as
fidgity as that filly back there  Feelin this ole clickclick kinda
soothes my fevered brow
In a silence that followed I watched a whippedcream cloud adrift on
the deepest of deep blue skies
Hi hum said Blister presently and extending his arms in a pretense
of stretching he shoved me off the fence  Youre welcome he said
to my protests and added Theres a nice matched pair
A boy leading a horse was emerging from the mouth of a stall
The contrast between them was startlingnever had I seen a horse with
so much elegant apparel rarely had I seen a boy with so little  The
boy followed by the horse began to walk a slow circle not far from
where we sat  Suddenly the boy addressed Blister
Say loan me the makins will you pal he drawled
From his hip pocket Blister produced some tobacco in a stained muslin
bag and a wad of crumpled cigarette papers  These he tossed toward the
boy
Yours trooly muttered that worthy as he picked up the makins
Heard the news about Hicky Rogers he asked while he rolled a
cigarette
Nothin except hes a crooked little snipe Blister answered
Huh that aint news said the boy  Theyve ruled him offthats
what I mean
That dont surprise me none Blister stated  Hes been gettin too
smart around here fur quite a while  Itll be a good riddance
Were you ever ruled off the track I asked Blister as the boy
exhaling clouds of cigarette smoke returned to the slow walking of his
horse  He studied in silence a moment
Yeponce he replied  I got mine at New Awlins fur ringin a hoss
That little ole town has got my goat
When was this I asked
The year I first starts conditionin hosses he answered
I had noticed that dates totally eluded Blister  A past occurrence as
far as its relation to time was concerned he always established by a
contemporary event of the turf  Pressed as to when a thing had taken
place he would say The year Salvation cops all the colt stakes or
