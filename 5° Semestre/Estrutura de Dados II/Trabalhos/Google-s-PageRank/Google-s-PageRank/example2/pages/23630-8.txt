certain Quakerish aspect
I dunno why folks be so feared of em Roxby remarked
speculatively The dead aint so oncommon nohow Them ez hev been
in the war like you an me done oughter be in an bout used ter
corpsesthough I never seen none o em afoot agin Lookin at a smit
field o battle arter the rage is jes passed oughter gin a body a
realizin sense how easy the sperit kin flee an what pore vessels fur
holdin the spark o life human clay be
Simeon Roxby had a keen not unkindly face and he had that look of
extreme intelligence which is entirely distinct from intellectuality
and which one sometimes sees in a minor degree in a very clever dog or a
fine horse One might rely on him to understand instinctively everything
one might say to him even in its subtler aesthetic values although he
had consciously learned little He was of the endowed natures to whom
much is given rather than of those who are set to acquire He had
many lines in his faceeven his simple life had gone hard with him its
sorrows un assuaged by its simplicity His hair was grizzled and hung
long and straight on his collar He wore a grizzled beard cut broad and
short His boots had big spurs although the lank old sorrel had never
felt them He sat his horse like the cavalryman he had been for four
years of hard riding and raiding but his face had a certain gentleness
that accented the Quakerlike suggestion of his garb a look of
communing with the higher things
I never blamed em he went on evidently reverting to the spectres
of the bridgeI never blamed em for comin back wunst in a while It
pears ter me twould take me a long time ter git familiar with heaven
an sociable with them ez hev gone before An my Lord jes think what
the good green yearth is Leastwise the mountings I aint settin store
on the valley lands I seen whenst I went ter the wars I kin remember
yit what them streets in the valley towns smelt like
He lifted his head drawing a long breath to inhale the exquisite
fragrance of the fir the freshness of the pellucid water the aroma of
the autumn wind blowing through the sere leaves still clinging red and
yellow to the boughs of the forest
Naw I aint blamin em though I dont hanker ter view em he
resumed One of em I wouldnt be afeard of though I feel mighty
sorry fur her The old folks used ter tell about her A young oman she
war acrossin this bredge with her child in her arms She war young
an mus have been keerless I reckon though ez twar her fust baby
she moightnt hev been practised in holdin it an sech an somehows
it slipped through her arms an fell inter the ruver an war killed in
a minit dashin agin the rocks She jes stood fur a second ascreamin
like a wild painter an jumped offn the bredge arter it She got it
agin for when they dragged her body outn the ruver she hed it in her
arms too tight fur even death ter onloose An thar they air together in
the buryinground
He gave a nod toward the slope of the mountain that intercepted the
melancholy view of the graveyard
Got it yit he continued bekase he lowered his voice on windy
nights whenst the moon is on the wane she is viewed kerryin the baby
along the bredgekerryin it clear over safe an sound like she
thought she oughter done I reckon in that one minute whilst she stood
an screamed an surveyed what she hed done That child would hev been
nigh ter my age ef he hed lived
Only the sunbeams wavered athwart the bridge now as the firs swayed
above giving glimpses of the sky and their fibrous shadows flickered
back and forth The wild mountain stream flashed white between the brown
bowlders and plunged down the gorge in a succession of cascades each
seeming more transparently green and amber and brown than the other The
chestnut horse gazed meditatively at these limpid outgushings having
drunk his fill then thought better of his moderation and once more
thrust his head down to the water The hand of his rider which had
made a motion to gather up the reins dropped leniently on his neck as
Simeon Roxby spoke again
Severalseveral others hev been viewed actin accordin ter thar
motions in life Now thar war a peddlersome say he slipped one icy
evenin bout dusk in wintersome say evil ones waylaid him fur his
gear an his goods in his pack but the settlemint mostly believes
he war alone whenst he fell His pack pears ter be full still they
saybut ye air bleeged ter know he hev hed ter set that pack down fur
good fore this time We kin take nuthin outn this world no matter
what kind o a line o goods we kerry in life Heavens no place fur
tradin I understan an I do wonder sometimes how in the worl them
merchants an sech in the valley towns air goin ter entertain tharsefs
in the happy land o Canaan Its goin ter be sorter bleak fur them
sures ye air born
With a look of freshened recollection he suddenly drew a plug of
tobacco from his pocket and he talked on even as he gnawed a piece from
it
Durin the war a cavalryman got shot out hyar whilst runnin crost
that thar footbredge Thar hed been a scrimmage an his horse war kilt
an he tuk ter the bresh on foot hopin ter hide in the laurel But ez
he war crossin the footbredge some o the pursuin party war fordin
the ruver over thar an thinkin hed make out ter escape they fired
on him jes ez the feller tried ter surrender He turned this way an
flung up both armsbut thars mighty leetle truce in a pistolball
That minute it tuk him right through the brain Seems tolerble long
range fur a pistol dont it He kin be viewed now most enny moonlight
night out hyar on the footbredge throwin up both hands in sign of
surrender
The wildgeese were awing on the way southward Looking up to that
narrow section of the blue sky which the incision of the gorge into
the very depths of the woods made visible he could see the tiny files
deploying along the azure or the flecking cirrus and hear the vague
clangor of their leaders cry He lifted his head to mechanically follow
their flight Then as his eyes came back to earth they rested again on
the old bridge
Strange enough he said suddenly the skerriest tale I hev ever
hearn bout that thar old bredge is one that my niece set agoin She
seen the harnt herself an it shakes me wuss n the idee o all the
rest
His companions gloomy gaze was lifted for a moment with an expression
of inquiry from the slowly widening circles of the water about the
horses head as he drank But Roxbys eyes with a certain gleam of
excitement a superstitious dilation still dwelt upon the bridge at
the end of the upward vista He went on merely from the impetus of the
subject Yes sirshe seen it apacin of its sorrowful way acrost
that bredge same ez the tothers of the percession o harnts Twar
my niece Millcentbrothers darterby name Millcent Roxby Waal

moon war bright in the buryingroun when they passed it an the
headboards stood up white an stiff an a light frost hed fell on the
mounds an they showed plain an shone sorter lonesome an cold
The young folks begun ter look behind em fur the wagin Some saidI

a following an kem down thar through all that black growthhe lifted
his arm and pointed at the great slope dense with fir and pine and the
heavy underbrushkeepin the bridlepatheasy enough even at night
fur the bresh is so thick they couldnt lose thar way But the moonlight
war mightily slivered up fallin through the needles of the pines an
the skeins of dead vines an looked bleached and onnatural an holped
the dark mighty leetle An they seen the water ashinin an aplungin
down the gorge an the glistenin of the frost on the floor o the
bredge Thar war a few icicles on the handrail an the branches o the
firs hung ez still ez death only that cold racin shoutin jouncin

cloud kem over the face o the sky Thar warnt no wind on the yearth
but up above the air war astirrin An Emry he lowed Millcent
shouldnt cross the footbredge whilst the light warnt clarI wonder
the critter hed that much sense An she jes drapped down on that rock
thar ter resthe pointed up the slope to a great fragment that had
broken off from the ledges and lay near the bank the bulk of the mass
was overgrown with moss and lichen but the jagged edges of the recent
fracture gleamed white and crystalline among the brown and olivegreen
shadows about it A tree was close beside it Agin that thar pine trunk
Emry he stood an leaned The rest war behind acomin down the
hill An all of a suddenty a light fell on the furder eend o
the footbredgea waverin light mighty white an misty in the
darksomeness Millcent lowed ez fust she thunk it war the moon An
lookin up she seen the cloud it held the moon close kivered An
lookin down she seen the light war movinmovin from the furder eend

Illustration The Phantom of the Footbridge 025
Lookin ter right an then ter lef the oman kem with now her right
hand shieldin the candle she held an now layin it on the handrail
The candle shone on the water fur it didnt flare an when the oman
held her hand before it the light made a bright spot on the footbredge
an in the dark air about her an on the fir branches over her head
An a thin mist seemed to hang about her white frock but not over her
face fur when she reached the middle o the footbredge she laid her
hand agin on the rail an in the clear light o the candle Millcent
seen the harnts face An thar she beheld her own face her own
face she looked upon ez she waited thar under the tree watchin the
footbredge her own face pale an troubled her own self dressed in
white crossin the footbredge an lightin her steps with a corpses
candle He drew up the reins abruptly He seemed in sudden haste to go
His companion looked with deepening interest at the bridge although he
followed his guides surging pathway to the opposite bank As the two
dripping horses struggled up the steep incline he asked Did the man
with her see the manifestation also
He lows he did responded Roxby equivocally But when Millcent
fust got so she could tell it peared ter me ez Emry Keen an fund it
ez much news ez the rest o weuns Millcent jes drapped stonedead
accordin ter all accounts an he an the tother young folks flung
water in her face till she kem outn her faint an jes then they hearn
the wagin arattlin along the road an they stopped it an fetched her
home in it She never told the tale till she war home an it skeered
me an my mother powerful fur Millcent is all the kin we hev got
Millcent is grandaddy an granmammy sons an daughters uncles an
aunts cousins nieces an nephews all in one The only thing I aint
pervided with is a nephewinlaw an I dont need him Leastwise I
aint lookin fur Emry Keenan jes at present
The pace was brisker when the two horses bending their strength
sturdily to the task had pressed up the massive slope from the deep
cleft of the gorge As the road curved about the outer verge of the
mountain the valley far beneath came into view with intersecting
valleys and transverse ranges dense with the growths of primeval
wildernesses and rugged with the tilted strata of great upheavals and
with chasms cut in the solid rock by centuries of erosion traces
of some remote cataclysmal period registering thus its throes and
turmoils The blue sky seen beyond a gaunt profile of one of the
farther summits that defined its craggy serrated edge against the
ultimate distances of the western heavens seemed of a singularly suave
tint incongruous with the savagery of the scene which clouds and
portents of storm might better have befitted The little graveyard
which John Dundas discerned with recognizing eyes albeit they had never
before rested upon it was revealed suddenly lying high on the opposite
side of the gorge No frost glimmered now on the lowly mounds the
flickering autumnal sunshine loitered unafraid among them according
to its languid wont for many a year Shadows of the gray unpainted
headboards lay on the withered grass brown and crisp with never
a cicada left to break the deathlike silence A tuft of red leaves
vagrant in the wind had been caught on one of the primitive monuments
and swayed there with a decorative effect The enclosure seemed to
unaccustomed eyes of small compass and few the denizens who had found
shelter here and a restingplace but it numbered all the dead of the
countryside for many a mile and many a year and somehow the loneliness
was assuaged to a degree by the reflection that they had known each
other in life unlike the great herds of cities and that it was a
common fate which the neighbors huddled together encountered in
company
It had no discordant effect in the pervasive sense of gloom of mighty
antagonistic forces with which the scene was replete it fostered a
realization of the pitiable minuteness and helplessness of human nature
in the midst of the vastness of inanimate nature and the evidences of
infinite lengths of forgotten time of the long reaches of unimagined
history eventful fateful which the landscape at once suggested and
revealed and concealed
Like the sudden flippant clatter of castanets in the pause of some
solemn funeral music was the impression given by the first glimpse along
the winding woodland way of a great flimsy white building with its
many pillars its piazzas its observatory its bandstand its garish
intimations of the giddy gay world of a summer hotel But alack it
too had its surfeit of woe
The guerrillas an bushwhackers tuk it out on the old hotel sure
observed Sim Roxby by way of introduction Thar warnt much fightin
hyarabouts an few sureenough soldiers ever kem along But wunst in a
while a band o guerrillas went through like a suddint windstorm an
I tell ye they made things whurl while they war about it They made a
sorter barracks o the old place Looks some like lightning hed struck
it
He had reined up his horse about one hundred yards in front of the
edifice where the weedgrown gravelled drivecarefully tended ten
years agonehad diverged from the straight avenue of poplars sweeping
in a circle around to the broad flight of steps
Though he qualified abruptly as if a sudden thought had struck
him ef ye air countin on buyin it a leetle money spent ter keerful
purpose will go a long way toward makin it ez good ez new
His companion did not reply and for the first time Roxby cast upon him
a covert glance charged with the curiosity which would have been earlier
and more easily aroused in another man by the manner of the stranger A
letterinfrequent missive in his experiencehad come from an ancient
companioninarms his former colonel requesting him in behalf of a
friend of the old commander to repair to the railway station thirty
miles distant to meet and guide this prospective purchaser of the old
hotel to the site of the property And now as Roxby looked at him the
suspicion which his kind heart had not been quick to entertain was
seized upon by his alert brain
The cunnels been fooled somehows he said to himself
For the look with which John Dundas contemplated the place was not the
gaze of him concerned with possible investmentwith the problems of
repair the details of the glazier and the painter and the plasterer
The mind was evidently neither braced for resistance nor resigned to
despair as behooves one smitten by the foreknowledge of the certainty
of the excess of the expenditures over the estimates Only with pensive
listless melancholy void of any intention his eyes traversed the
long rows of open doors riven by rude hands from their locks swinging
helplessly to and fro in the wind and giving to the deserted and
desolate old place a spurious air of motion and life Many of the
shutters had been wrenched from their hinges and lay rotting on the
floors The ballroom windows caught on their shattered glass the
reflection of the clouds and it seemed as if here and there a wan face
looked through at the riders wending along the weedgrown path Where so
many faces had been what wonder that a similitude should linger in the
loneliness The pallid face seemed to draw back as they glanced up while
slowly pacing around the drive A rabbit sitting motionless on the front
piazza did not draw back although observing them with sedate eyes as
he poised himself upright on his haunches with his listless forepaws
suspended in the air and it occurred to Dundas that he was probably
unfamiliar with the presence of human beings and had never heard the
crack of a gun A great swirl of swallows came soaring out of the big
kitchen chimneys and circled in the sky darting down again and again
upward Through an open passage was a glimpse of a quadrangle with its
weedgrown spaces and litter of yellow leaves A tawny streak a red
fox sped through it as Dundas looked A halfmoon all atilt hung
above it He saw the glimmer through the bare boughs of the leafless
locusttrees here and there still standing although outside on the lawn
many a stump bore token how ruthlessly the bushwhackers had furnished
their fires
That thar moons ahangin fur rain said the mountaineer commenting
upon the aspect of the luminary which he too had noticed as they
passed I aint sprised none ef we hev fallin weather agin fore
day an the manby name Morgan Holdenthat hev charge o the hotel
property cant git back fur a week an better
A vague wonder to find himself so suspicious flitted through his mind
with the thought that perhaps the colonel might have reckoned on this
delay Surely the ruvers down yander at Knoxville mus be aboomin
with all this wet weather he said to himself
Then aloud Morgan Holden he went ter Colbury ter tend ter some
business in court an the ruvers hev riz so that what with the bredges
bein washed away an the fords so onsartain an tricky hell stay till
the ruver falls He dont know ye war kemin ye see The mailrider hev
quit count o the rise in the ruver an thars no way ter git word
ter him Still ef ye air minded ter wait Ill be powerful obligated
fur yer compny down ter my house till the ruver falls an Holden he
gits back
The stranger murmured his obligations but his eyes dwelt lingeringly
upon the old hotel with its flapping doors and its shattered windows
Through the recurrent vistas of these placed opposite in the rooms
came again broken glimpses of the grassy space within the quadrangle
with its leafless locusttrees first of all to yield their foliage to
the autumn wind where a tiny owl was shrilling stridulously under the
lonely red sky and the melancholy moon
Hed ye lowed ter put up at the old hotel asked Roxby some inherent
quickness supplying the lack of a definite answer
For the first time the stranger turned upon him a look more expressive
than the casual fragmentary attention with which he had half heeded
half ignored his talk since their first encounter at the railway
station
A simple fellow but good as gold was the phrase with which Simeon
Roxby had been commended as guide and in some sort guard
Not so simple perhaps the sophisticated man thought as their eyes
met Not so simple but that the truth must serve The colonel suggested
that it might be best he replied more alert to the present moment
than his languid preoccupation had heretofore permitted
The answer was good as far as it went A few days spent in the old
hostelry certainly would serve well to acquaint the prospective
purchaser with its actual condition and the measures and means needed
for its repair but as Sim Roxby stood there with the cry of the owl
shrilling in the desert air the lonely red sky the ominous tilted
moon the doors drearily flapping to and fro as the wind stole into the
forlorn and empty place and sped back affrighted he marvelled at the
refuge contemplated
I believe there is some of the furniture here yet We could contrive to
set up a bed from what is left The colonel could make it all right with
Holden and I could stay a day or two as we originally planned
Yees I dont mind Holden a man aint much in charge of a place ez
aint got a lock or a key ter bless itself with an takes the owel an
the fox an the gopher fur boarders but ennyhow kem with me home ter
supper Millcent will hev it ready by now ennyhows an ye need suthin
hearty an hot ter stiffen ye up ter move inter sech quarters ez these
Dundas hesitated but the mountaineer had already taken assent for
granted and pushed his horse into a sharp trot Evidently a refusal was
not in order Dundas pressed forward and they rode together along the
winding way past the tenpin alley its long low roof half hidden in the
encroaching undergrowth springing up apace beneath the great trees past
the stables past a line of summer cottages strangely staring of aspect
out of the yawning doors and windows giving instead of an impression
of vacancy a sense of covert watching of secret occupancy If ones
glances were only quick enough were there not faces pressed to those
shattered panesscarcely seenswiftly withdrawn
He was in a desert he had hardly been so utterly alone in all his life
yet he bore through the empty place a feeling of espionage and ever
and anon he glanced keenly at the overgrown lawns with their deepening
drifts of autumn leaves at the staring windows and flaring doors which
emitted sometimes sudden creaking wails in the silence as if he sought
to assure himself of the vacancy of which his mind took cognizance and
yet all his senses denied
Little of his sentiment although sedulously cloaked was lost on Sim
Roxby and he was aware too in some subtle way of the relief his
guest experienced when they plunged into the darkening forest and left
the forlorn place behind them The clearing in which it was situated
seemed an oasis of light in the desert of night in which the rest of
the world lay From the obscurity of the forest Dundas saw through the
vistas of the giant trees the clustering cottages the great hotel
gables and chimneys and tower stark and distinct as in some weird
dreamlight in the midst of the encircling gloom The afterglow of
sunset was still aflare on the western windows the whole empty place
was alight with a reminiscence of its old aspectits old gay life Who
knows what memories were astalk therewhat semblance of former times
What might not the darkness foster the impunity of desertion the
associations that inhabited the place with almost the strength of human
occupancy itself Who knowswho knows
He remembered the scene afterward the impression he received And from
this he thought arose his regret for his decision to take up here his
abidingplace
The forest shut out the illumined landscape and the night seemed indeed
at hand the gigantic boles of the trees loomed through the encompassing
gloom that was yet a semitransparent medium like some dark but clear
fluid through which objects were dimly visible albeit tinged with its
own sombre hue The lank rawboned sorrel had set a sharp pace to
which the chestnut after momentary lagging as if weary with the days
travel responded briskly He had received in some way intimations that
his companions corncrib was near at hand and if he had not deduced
from these premises the probability of sharing his fare his mental
processes served him quite as well as reason and brought him to the
same result On and on they sped neck and neck through the darkening
woods fire flashed now and again from their ironshod hoofs often
a splash and a shower of drops told of a swift dashing through the
mudholes that recent rains had fostered in the shallows The dank odor
of dripping boughs came on the clear air Once the chestnut shied from a
sudden strange shining point springing up in the darkness close at
hand which the countrybred horse discriminated as foxfire and
kept steadily on unmindful of the rotting log where it glowed Far in
advance in the dank depths of the woods a Willothewisp danced and
flickered and lured the travellers eye The stranger was not sure of
the different quality of another light appearing down a vista as the
road turned until the sorrel making a tremendous spurt headed for it
uttering a joyous neigh at the sight
The deepvoiced barking of hounds rose melodiously on the silence
and as the horses burst out of the woods into a small clearing Dundas
beheld in the brighter light a halfdozen of the animals nimbly afoot in
the road one springing over the fence another in the act of climbing
his forepaws on the topmost rail his long neck stretched and his head
turning about in attitudes of observation He evidently wished to assure
himself whether the excitement of his friends was warranted by the facts
before he troubled himself to vault over the fence Three or four still
lingered near the door of a logcabin fawning about a girl who stood on
the porch Her pose was alert expectant a fire in the dooryard where
the domestic manufacture of soap had been in progress cast a red flare
on the house its appurtenances the great dark forest looming all
around and more than the glow of the hearth within lighted up the
central figure of the scene She was tall straight and strong a
wealth of fair hair was clustered in a knot at the back of her head and
fleecy tendrils fell over her brow on it was perched a soldierscap
and certainly more gallant and fearless eyes had never looked out from
under the straight stiff brim Her chin firm round dimpled was
uplifted as she raised her head descrying the horsemens approach She
wore a full darkred skirt a dark brown waist and around her neck
was twisted a gray cotton kerchief faded to a pale ashen hue the
neutrality of which somehow aided the delicate brilliancy of the
blended roseate and pearly tints of her face Was this the seer of
ghostsDundas marvelledthis the Millicent whose pallid and troubled
phantom alreadypaced the footbridge
He did not realize that he had drawn up his horse suddenly at the sight
of her nor did he notice that his host had dismounted until Roxby was
at the chestnuts head ready to lead the animal to supper in the barn
His evident surprise his preoccupation were not lost upon Roxby
however His hand hesitated on the girth of the chestnuts saddle when
he stood between the two horses in the barn He had half intended to
disregard the strangers declination of his invitation and stable the
creature Then he shook his head slowly the mystery that hung about the
newcomer was not reassuring A heap o wuthless cattle mongst them
valley men he said for the war had been in some sort an education to
his simplicity Let him stay whar the cunnel expected him ter stay I
aint wantin no stranger ahangin round about Millcent nohow Emry
Keenan aint a pattern o perfection but I be tolerble well acquainted
with the cut o his foolishness an I know his daddy an mammy an
both sets o grandaddies an granmammies an I could tell ye exacly
which one the critter got his nose an his mouth from an them lean
sheepseyes o hisn an nigh every tone o his voice Emry never
thunk afore ez I set store on bein acquainted with him He lowed I
knowed him too well
He laughed as he glanced through the open door into the darkening
landscape Horizontal gray clouds were slipping fast across the pearly
spaces of the sky The yellow stubble gleamed among the brown earth
of the farther field still striped with its furrows The black forest
encircled the little cleared space and a wind was astir among the
treetops A white star gleamed through the broken clapboards of the
roof the fire still flared under the soapkettle in the dooryard and
the silence was suddenly smitten by a high cracked old voice which told
him that his mother had perceived the dismounted stranger at the gate
and was graciously welcoming him
She had come to the door where the girl still stood but half withdrawn
in the shadow Dundas silently bowed as he passed her following his
aged hostess into the low room all bedight with the firelight of a huge
chimneyplace and comfortable with the realization of a journeys end
The wilderness might stretch its weary miles around the weird wind
wander in the solitudes the star look coldly on unmoved by aught it
beheld the moon show sad portents but at the door they all failed
for here waited rest and peace and human companionship and the sense of
home
Take a cheer stranger an make yerself at home Powerful glad ter
see yewar feard night would overtake ye Ye fund the water tolerble
high in all the creeks an sech I reckon an fords shifty an
onsartain Yes sir Fall rains kem on earliern common an moren
