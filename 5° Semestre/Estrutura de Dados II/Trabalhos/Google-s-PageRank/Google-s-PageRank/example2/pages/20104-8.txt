promise that he would not suffer in heart for one who had longed to go
into a peace for which he had waited seemingly in vain  Year after
year Thornton Fairchild had sat in the big armchair by the windows
watching the days grow old and fade into night studying sunset after
sunset voicing the vain hope that the gloaming might bring the
twilight of his own existencea silent man except for this rarely
speaking of the past never giving to the son who worked for him cared
for him worshiped him the slightest inkling of what might have
happened in the dim days of the long ago to transform him into a beaten
thing longing for the final surcease  And when the end came it found
him in readiness waiting in the big armchair by the windows  Even
now a book lay on the frayed carpeting of the old room where it had
fallen from relaxing fingers  Robert Fairchild picked it up and with
a sigh restored it to the grim fumed oak case  His days of petty
sacrifices that his father might while away the weary hours with
reading were over
Memories  They were all about him in the grate with its blackened
coals the oldfashioned pictures on the walls the almost gloomy
rooms the big chair by the window and yet they told him nothing
except that a whitehaired patient lovable old man was gonea man
whom he was wont to call father  And in that going the slow
procedure of an unnatural existence had snapped for Robert Fairchild
As he roamed about in his loneliness he wondered what he would do now
where he could go to whom he could talk  He had worked since sixteen
and since sixteen there had been few times when he had not come home
regularly each night to wait upon the whitehaired man in the big
chair to discern his wants instinctively and to sit with him often
in silence until the old onyx clock on the mantel had clanged eleven
it had been the same program day week month and year  And now
Robert Fairchild was as a person lost  The ordinary pleasures of youth
had never been his he could not turn to them with any sort of grace
The years of servitude to a beloved master had inculcated within him
the feeling of selfimpelled sacrifice he had forgotten all thought of
personal pleasures for their sake alone  The big chair by the window
was vacant and it created a void which Robert Fairchild could neither
combat nor overcome
What had been the past  Why the silence  Why the patient yet
impatient wait for death  The son did not know  In all his memories
was only one faint picture painted years before in babyhood the
return of his father from some place he knew not where a long
conference with his mother behind closed doors while he in childlike
curiosity waited without seeking in vain to catch some explanation
Then a sadfaced woman who cried at night when the house was still who
faded and who died  That was all  The picture carried no explanation
And now Robert Fairchild stood on the threshold of something he almost
feared to learn  Once on a black stormy night they had sat
together father and son before the fire silent for hours  Then the
hand of the whitehaired man had reached outward and rested for a
moment on the young mans knee
I wrote something to you Boy a day or so ago he had said  That
little illness I had prompted me to do it  II thought it was only
fair to you  After I m gone look in the safe  You ll find the
combination on a piece of paper hidden in a hole cut in that old
European history in the bookcase  I have your promise I knowthat
you ll not do it until after I m gone
Now Thornton Fairchild was gone  But a message had remained behind
one which the patient lips evidently had feared to utter during life
The heart of the son began to pound slow and hard as with the memory
of that conversation he turned toward the bookcase and unlatched the
paneled door  A moment more and the hollowed history had given up its
trust a bit of paper scratched with numbers  Robert Fairchild turned
toward the stairs and the small room on the second floor which had
served as his fathers bedroom
There he hesitated before the little iron safe in the corner summoning
the courage to unlock the doors of a dead mans past  At last he
forced himself to his knees and to the numerals of the combination
The safe had not been opened in years that was evident from the
creaking of the plungers as they fell the gummy resistance of the knob
as Fairchild turned it in accordance with the directions on the paper
Finally a great wrench and the bolt was drawn grudgingly back a
strong pull and the safe opened
A few old books ledgers in sheepskin binding  Fairchild disregarded
these for the more important things that might lie behind the little
inner door of the cabinet  His hand went forward and he noticed in a
hazy sort of way that it was trembling  The door was unlocked he
drew it open and crouched a moment staring before he reached for the
thinner of two envelopes which lay before him  A moment later he
straightened and turned toward the light  A crinkling of paper a
quickdrawn sigh between clenched teeth it was a letter his strange
quiet huntedappearing father was talking to him through the medium of
ink and paper after death
Closely written hurriedly as though to finish an irksome task in as
short a space as possible the missive was one of several pagespages
which Robert Fairchild hesitated to read  The secretand he knew full
well that there was a secrethad been in the atmosphere about him ever
since he could remember  Whether or not this was the solution of it
Robert Fairchild did not know and the natural reticence with which he
had always approached anything regarding his fathers life gave him an
instinctive fear a sense of cringing retreat from anything that might
now open the doors of mystery  But it was before him waiting in his
fathers writing and at last his gaze centered he read
My son
Before I begin this letter to you I must ask that you take no action
whatever until you have seen my attorneyhe will be yours from now on
I have never mentioned him to you before it was not necessary and
would only have brought you curiosity which I could not have satisfied
But now I am afraid the doors must be unlocked  I am gone  You are
young you have been a faithful son and you are deserving of every good
fortune that may possibly come to you  I am praying that the years
have made a difference and that Fortune may smile upon you as she
frowned on me  Certainly she can injure me no longer  My race is
run I am beyond earthly fortunes
Therefore when you have finished with this take the deeds inclosed in
the larger envelope and go to St Louis  There look up Henry F
Beamish attorneyatlaw in the Princess Building  He will explain
them to you
Beyond this I fear there is little that can aid you  I cannot find
the strength now that I face it to tell you what you may find if you
follow the lure that the other envelope holds forth to you
There is always the hope that Fortune may be kind to me at last and
smile upon my memory by never letting you know why I have been the sort
of man you have known and not the jovial genial companion that a
father should be  But there are certain things my son which defeat a
man  It killed your motherevery day since her death I have been
haunted by that fact my prayer is that it may not kill you
spiritually if not physically  Therefore is it not better that it
remain behind a cloud until such time as Fortune may reveal itand
hope that such a time will never come  I think sonot for myself for
when you read this I shall be gone but for you that you may not be
handicapped by the knowledge of the thing which whitened my hair and
aged me long before my time
If he lives and I am sure he does there is one who will hurry to your
aid as soon as he knows you need him  Accept his counsels laugh at
his little eccentricities if you will but follow his judgment
implicitly  Above all ask him no questions that he does not care to
answerthere are things that he may not deem wise to tell  It is only
fair that he be given the right to choose his disclosures
There is little more to say  Beamish will attend to everything for
youif you care to go  Sell everything that is here the house the
furniture the belongings  It is my wish and you will need the
capitalif you go  The ledgers in the safe are only old accounts
which would be so much Chinese to you now  Burn them  There is
nothing else to be afraid ofI hope you will never find anything to
fear  And if circumstances should arise to bring before you the story
of that which has caused me so much darkness I have nothing to say in
selfextenuation  I made one mistakethat of fearand in committing
one error I shouldered every blame  It makes little difference now
I am deadand free
My love to you my son  I hope that wealth and happiness await you
Blood of my blood flows in your veinsand strange though it may sound
to youit is the blood of an adventurer  I can almost see you smile
at that  An old man who sat by the window staring out afraid of
every knock at the doorand yet an adventurer  But they say once in
the blood it never dies  My wish is that you succeed where I
failedand God be with you
Your father
For a long moment Robert Fairchild stood staring at the letter his
heart pounding with excitement his hands grasping the foolscap paper
as though with a desire to tear through the shield which the written
words had formed about a mysterious past and disclose that which was so
effectively hidden  So much had the letter toldand yet so little
Dark had been the hints of some mysterious intangible thing great
enough in its horror and its farreaching consequences to cause death
for one who had known of it and a living panic for him who had
perpetrated it  As for the man who stood now with the letter clenched
before him there was promise of wealth and the threat of sorrow the
hope of happiness yet the foreboding omen of discoveries which might
ruin the life of the reader as the existence of the writer had been
blasteduntil death had brought relief  Of all this had the letter
told but when Robert Fairchild read it again in the hope of something
tangible something that might give even a clue to the reason for it
all there was nothing  In that supercalmness which accompanies great
agitation Fairchild folded the paper placed it in its envelope then
slipped it into an inside pocket  A few steps and he was before the
safe once more and reaching for the second envelope
Heavy and bulky was this filled with tax receipts with plats and
blueprints and the reports of surveyors  Here was an assay slip
bearing figures and notations which Robert Fairchild could not
understand  Here a receipt for money received here a varicolored map
with lines and figures and conglomerate designs which Fairchild
believed must relate in some manner to the location of a mining camp
all were aged and worn at the edges giving evidence of having been
carried at some far time of the past in a wallet  More receipts
more blueprints then a legal document sealed and stamped and bearing
the words
County of Clear Creek    ss
State of Colorado
DEED PATENT
KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS That on this day of our Lord February
22 1892 Thornton W Fairchild having presented the necessary
affidavits and statements of assessments accomplished in accordance
with
On it trailed in endless legal phraseology telling in muddled
attorneylike language the fact that the law had been fulfilled in its
requirements and that the claim for which Thornton Fairchild had
worked was rightfully his forever  A longer statement full of
figures of diagrams and surveyors calculations which Fairchild could
neither decipher nor understand gave the location the town site and
the property included within the granted rights  It was something for
an attorney such as Beamish to interpret and Fairchild reached for
the ageyellowed envelope to return the papers to their resting place
But he checked his motion involuntarily and for a moment held the
envelope before him staring at it with wide eyes  Then as though to
free by the stronger light of the window the haunting thing which faced
him he rose and hurried across the room to better light only to find
it had not been imagination the words still were before him a
sentence written in faint faded ink proclaiming the contents to be
Papers relating to the Blue Poppy Mine and written across this a
word in the bolder harsher strokes of a man under stress of emotion a
word which held the eyes of Robert Fairchild fixed and staring a word
which spelled books of the past and evil threats of the future the
single ominous word
Accursed
CHAPTER II
One works quickly when prodded by the pique of curiosity  And in spite
of all that omens could foretell in spite of the dull gloomy life
which had done its best to fashion a matteroffact brain for Robert
Fairchild one sentence in that letter had found an echo had started a
pulsating something within him that he never before had known
It is the blood of an adventurer
And it seemed that Robert Fairchild needed no more than the knowledge
to feel the tingle of it the old house suddenly became stuffy and
prisonlike as he wandered through it  Within his pocket were two
envelopes filled with threats of the future defying him to advance and
fight it outwhatever it might be  Again and again pounded through
his head the fact that only a night of travel intervened between
Indianapolis and St Louis within twelve hours he could be in the
office of Henry Beamish  And then
A hurried resolution  A hasty packing of a traveling bag and the
cashing of a check at the cigar store down on the corner  A wakeful
night while the train clattered along upon its journey  Then morning
and walking of streets until office hours  At last
I m Robert Fairchild he said as he faced a whitehaired
Cupidfaced man in the rather dingy offices of the Princess Building
A slow smile spread over the pudgy features of the genial appearing
attorney and he waved a fat hand toward the offices extra chair
Sit down Son came casually  Need nt have announced yourself  I
d have known youjust like your father Boy  How is he  Then his
face suddenly sobered  I m afraid your presence is the answer  Am I
right
Fairchild nodded gravely  The old attorney slowly placed his fat hands
together peaking the fingers and stared out of the window to the
grimy roof and signboards of the next building
Perhaps its better so he said at last  We had nt seen each other
in ten yearsnot since I went up to Indianapolis to have my last talk
with him  Did he get any cheerier beforehe went
No
Just the same huh  Always waiting
Afraid of every step on the veranda of every knock at the door
Again the attorney stared out of the window
And you
I  Fairchild leaned forward in his chair  I dont understand
Are you afraid
Of what
The lawyer smiled
I dont know  Only and he leaned forwardits just as though I
were living my younger days over this morning  It doesnt seem any
time at all since your father was sitting just about where you are now
and gad Boy how much you look like he looked that morning  The same
grayblue earnest eyes the same dark hair the same strong shoulders
and good manly chin the same buildand look of determination about
him  The call of adventure was in his blood and he sat there all
enthusiastic telling me what he intended doing and asking my
advicealthough he would nt have followed it if I had given it  Back
home was a baby and the woman he loved and out West was sudden wealth
waiting for the right man to come along and find it  Gad
Whitehaired old Beamish chuckled with the memory of it  He almost
made me throw over the law business that morning and go out adventuring
with him  Then four years later the tone changed suddenly he came
back
What then  Fairchild was on the edge of his chair  But Beamish only
spread his hands
Truthfully Boy I dont know  I have guessedbut I wont tell you
what  All I know is that your father found what he was looking for and
was on the point of achieving his every dream when something happened
Then three men simply disappeared from the mining camp announcing that
they had failed and were going to hunt new diggings  That was all
One of them was your father
But you said that he d found
Silver running twenty ounces to the ton on an eightinch vein which
gave evidences of being only the beginning of a bonanza  I know
because he had written me that a month before
And he abandoned it
He d forgotten what he had written when I saw him again  I did nt
question him  I did nt want tohis face told me enough to guess that
I would nt learn  He went home then after giving me enough money to
pay the taxes on the mine for the next twenty years simply as his
attorney and without divulging his whereabouts  I did it  Eight years
or so later I saw him in Indianapolis  He gave me more moneyenough
for eleven or twelve years
And that was ten years ago Robert Fairchilds eyes were reminiscent
I rememberI was only a kid  He sold off everything he had except
the house
Henry Beamish walked to his safe and fumbled there a moment to return
at last with a few slips of paper
Here s the answer he said quietly the taxes are paid until 1922
Robert Fairchild studied the receipts carefullyfutilely  They told
him nothing  The lawyer stood looking down upon him at last he laid a
hand on his shoulder
Boy came quietly I know just about what you re thinking  I ve
spent a few hours at the same kind of a job myself and I ve called
old Henry Beamish more kinds of a fool than you can think of for not
coming right out flatfooted and making Thornton tell me the whole
story  But some way when I d look into those eyes with the fire all
dead and ashen within them and see the lines of an old man in his
young face Iwell I guess I m too softhearted to make folks
suffer  I just couldnt do it
So you can tell me nothing
I m afraid thats truein one way  In another I m a fund of
information  Tonight you and I will go to Indianapolis and probate
the willits simple enough I ve had it in my safe for ten years
After that you become the owner of the Blue Poppy mine to do with as
you choose
But
The old lawyer chuckled
Dont ask my advice Boy  I have nt any  Your father told me what
to do if you decided to try your luckand silver s at 129  It
means a lot of money for anybody who can produce pay oreunless what
he said about the mine pinching out was true
Again the thrill of a new thing went through Robert Fairchilds veins
something he never had felt until twelve hours before again the urge
for strange places new scenes the fire of the hunt after the hidden
wealth of silverseamed hills  Somewhere it lay awaiting him nor did
he even know in what form  Robert Fairchilds life had been a plodding
thing of books and accounts of high desks which as yet had failed to
stoop his shoulders of stuffy offices which had been thwarted so far
in their grip at his lung power the long walk in the morning and the
tired trudge homeward at night to save petty carfare for a silent mans
pettier luxuries had looked after that  But the recoil had not exerted
itself against an officecramped brain a dusty ledgerfilled life that
suddenly felt itself crying out for the free open country without
hardly knowing what the term meant  Old Beamish caught the light in
the eyes the quick contraction of the hands and smiled
You dont need to tell me Son he said slowly  I can see the
symptoms  You ve got the feverYou re going to work that mine
Perhaps and he shrugged his shoulders its just as well  But there
are certain things to remember
Name them
Ohadi is thirtyeight miles from Denver  Thats your goal  Out
there they ll tell you how the mine caved in and how Thornton
Fairchild who had worked it together with his two men Harry Harkins
a Cornishman and Sissie Larsen a Swede left town late one night
for Cripple Creekand that they never came back  Thats the story
they ll tell you  Agree with it  Tell them that Harkins as far as
you know went back to Cornwall and that you have heard vaguely that
Larsen later followed the mining game farther out West
Is it the truth
How do I know  It s good enoughpeople should nt ask questions
Tell nothing more than thatand be careful of your friends  There is
one man to watchif he is still alive  They call him Squint
Rodaine and he may or may not still be there  I dont knowI m only
sure of the fact that your father hated him fought him and feared him
The mine tunnel is two miles up Kentucky Gulch and one hundred yards to
the right  A surveyor can lead you to the very spot  Its been
abandoned now for thirty years  What you ll find there is more than I
can guess  But Boy and his hand clenched tight on Robert
Fairchilds shoulder whatever you do whatever you run into whatever
friends or enemies you find awaiting you dont let that light die out
of your eyes and dont pull in that chin  If you find a fight on your
hands whether its man beast or nature sail into it  If you run
into things that cut your very heart out to learnbeat em down and
keep going  And win  Therethats all the advice I know  Meet me at
the 1110 train for Indianapolis  Goodby
GoodbyI ll be there  Fairchild grasped the pudgy hand and left
the office  For a moment afterward old Henry Beamish stood thinking
and looking out over the dingy roof adjacent  Then somewhat absently
he pressed the ancient electric button for his more ancient
stenographer
Call a messenger please he ordered when she entered I want to
send a cablegram
CHAPTER III
Two weeks later Robert Fairchild sat in the smoking compartment of the
Overland Limited looking at the Rocky Mountains in the distance  In
his pocket were a few hundred dollars in the bank in Indianapolis a
few thousand representing the final proceeds of the sale of everything
that had connected him with a rather dreary past  Out before him
The train had left Limon Junction on its last clattering rushing leg
of the journey across the plains tearing on through a barren country
of tumbleweed of sagebrush of prairiedog villages and jagged arroyos
toward the great crumpled hills in the distancehills which meant
everything to Robert Fairchild  Two weeks had created a metamorphosis
in what had been a plodding matteroffact man with dreams which did
not extend beyond his ledgers and his gloomy homebut now a man
leaning his head against the window of a rushing train staring ahead
toward the Rockies and the rainbow they held for him  Back to the
place where his father had gone with dreams aglow was the son traveling
nowback into the rumpled mountains where the blue haze hung low and
protecting as though over mysteries and treasures which awaited one man
and one alone  Robert Fairchild momentarily had forgotten the
foreboding omens which like murky shadows had been cast in his path
by a beaten willbroken father  He only knew that he was young that
he was strong that he was free from the drudgery which had sought to
claim him forever he felt only the surge of excitement that can come
with new surroundings new country new life  Out there before him as
the train rattled over culverts spanning the dry arroyos or puffed
gingerly up the grades toward the higher levels of the plains were the
hills gray and brown in the foreground blue as the blue sea farther
on then fringing into the sunpinked radiance of the snowy range
forming the last barrier against a turquoise sky  It thrilled
Fairchild it caused his heart to tug and pullnor could he tell
exactly why
Still eighty miles away the range was sharply outlined to Fairchild
from the ragged hump of Pikes Peak far to the south on up to where the
gradual lowering of the mighty upheaval slid away into Wyoming  Eighty
miles yet they were clear with the clearness that only altitudinous
country can bring alluring fascinating beckoning to him until his
being rebelled against the comparative slowness of the train and the
minutes passed in a dragging longdrawnout sequence that was almost
an agony to Robert Fairchild
Hours  The hills came closer  Still closer then when it seemed that
the train must plunge straight into them they drew away again as
though through some optical illusion and brooded in the background as
the long transcontinental train began to bang over the frogs and
switches as it made its entrance into Denver  Fairchild went through
the long chute and to a ticket window of the Union Station
When can I get a train for Ohadi
The ticket seller smiled  You cant get one
But the map shows that a railroad runs there
Ran there you mean chaffed the clerk
The best you can do is get to Forks Creek and walk the rest of the
way  Thats a narrowgauge line and Clear Creek s been on a rampage
It took out about two hundred feet of trestle and there wont be a
train into Ohadi for a week
The disappointment on Fairchilds face was more than apparent almost
boyish in its depression  The ticket seller leaned closer to the
wicket
Stranger out here
Very much of one
In a hurry to get to Ohadi
Yes
Then you can go uptown and hire a taxithey ve got big cars for
mountain work and there are good roads all the way  It ll cost
fifteen or twenty dollars  Or
Fairchild smiled  Give me the other system if you ve got one  I m
not terribly long on cashfor taxis
Certainly  I was just going to tell you about it  No use spending
that money if you ve got a little pep and it is nt a matter of life
or death  Go up to the Central Loopanybody can direct youand catch
a street car for Golden  That eats up fifteen miles and leaves just
twentythree miles more  Then ask somebody to point out the road over
Mount Lookout  Machines go along there every few minutesno trouble
at all to catch a ride  You ll be in Ohadi in no time
Fairchild obeyed the instructions and in the baggage room rechecked
his trunk to follow him lightening his traveling bag at the same time
until it carried only necessities  A luncheon then the street car
Three quarters of an hour later he began the fivemile trudge up the
broad smooth carefully groomed automobile highway which masters Mount
Lookout  A rumbling sound behind him then as he stepped to one side
a grimy truck driver leaned out to shout as he passed
Want a lift  Hop on  Cant stoptoo much grade
A running leap and Fairchild seated himself on the tailboard of the
truck swinging his legs and looking out over the fading plains as the
truck roared and clattered upward along the twisting mountain road
Higher higher while the truck labored along the grade and while the
buildings in Golden below shrank smaller and smaller  The reservoir
lake in the center of the town a broad expanse of water only a short
time before began to take on the appearance of some great bluewhite
diamond glistening in the sun  Gradually a stream outlined itself in
living topography upon a map which seemed as large as the world itself
Denver fifteen miles away came into view its streets showing like
seams in a wellsewn garment the sun even at this distance striking
a sheen from the golden dome of the capitol building  Higher  The
chortling truck gasped at the curves and tugged on the straightaway
but Robert Fairchild had ceased to hear  His every attention was
centered on the tremendous stage unfolded before him the vast
stretches of the plains rolling away beneath even into Kansas and
Wyoming and Nebraska hundreds of miles away plains where once the
buffalo had roamed in great shaggy herds where once the emigrant
trains had made their slow rocking progress into a Land of Hearts
Desire and he began to understand something of the vastness of life
the great scope of ambition new things to a man whose world until two
weeks before had been the four chalky walls of an office
Cool breezes from pinefringed gulches brushed his cheek and smoothed
away the burning touch of a glaring sun the truck turned into the
hairpin curves of the steep ascent giving him a glimpse of deep
valleys green from the touch of flowing streams of great clefts with
their varihued splotches of granite and on beyond mound after mound
of pineclothed hills fringing the peaks of eternal snow far away
The blood suddenly grew hot in Fairchilds veins he whistled he
repressed a wild spasmodic desire to shout  The spirit that had been
the spirit of the determined men of the emigrant trains was his now he
remembered that he was traveling slowly toward a fightagainst whom
or what he knew notbut he welcomed it just the same  The exaltation
of rarefied atmosphere was in his brain dingy offices were gone
forever  He was free and for the first time in his life he
appreciated the meaning of the word
Upward still upward  The town below became merely a checkerboard
thing the lake a dot of gleaming silver the stream a scintillating
ribbon stretching off into the foothills  A turn and they skirted a
tremendous valley its slopes falling away in sheer descents from the
roadway  A darkened moist stretch of road fringed by pines then a
jogging journey over rolling tableland  At last came a voice from the
drivers seat and Fairchild turned like a man suddenly awakened
Turn off up here at Genesee Mountain  Which way do you go
Trying to get to Ohadi  Fairchild shouted it above the roar of the
engine  The driver waved a hand forward
Keep to the main road  Drop off when I make the turn  You ll pick
up another ride soon  Plenty of chances
Thanks for the lift
Aw forget it
The truck wheeled from the main road and chugged away leaving
Fairchild afoot making as much progress as possible toward his goal
until good fortune should bring a swifter means of locomotion  A
halfmile he walked studying the constant changes of the scenery
before him the slopes and rises the smooth valleys and jagged crags
above the clouds as they drifted low upon the higher peaks shielding
them from view for a moment then disappearing  Then suddenly he
wheeled  Behind him sounded the swift droning of a motor cutout
open as it rushed forward along the roadand the noise told a story
of speed
