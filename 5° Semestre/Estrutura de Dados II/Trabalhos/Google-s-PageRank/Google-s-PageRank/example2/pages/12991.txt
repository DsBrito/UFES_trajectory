THE PILGRIM AND HIS PILGRIMAGE
Illustration The Pilgrim and His Pilgrimage  see king002png
For many many weary months the Pilgrim journeyed in the wide and
pathless Desert of Facts So many indeed were the months that the
wayworn Pilgrim himself came at last to forget their number
And always for the Pilgrim the sky by day was a sky of brass softened
not by so much as a wreath of cloud mist Always for him the hot air
was stirred not by so much as the lift of a wild birds wing Never for
him was the awful stillness of the night broken by voice of his kind
by footfall of beast or by rustle of creeping thing For the toiling
Pilgrim in the vast and pathless Desert of Facts there was no kindly
face no friendly fire Only the stars were manymany and very near
Day after day as the Pilgrim labored onward through the torturing
heat under the sky of brass he saw on either hand lakes of living
waters and groves of many palms And the waters called him to their
healing coolness the palms beckoned him to their restful shade and
shelter Night after night in the dreadful solitude frightful Shapes
came on silent feet out of the silent darkness to stare at him with
doubtful questioning threatening eyes drawing back at last if he
stood still as silently as they had come or if he advanced vanishing
quickly only to reappear as silently in another place
But the Pilgrim knew that the enchanting scenes that lured him by day
were but pictures in the heated air He knew that the fearful Shapes
that haunted him by night were but creatures of his own overwrought
fancy And so he journeyed on and ever on in the staggering heat under
the sky of brass in the awful stillness of the night on and ever on
through the wide and pathless waste until he came at last to the
OuterEdgeOfThingscame to the place that is between the Desert of
Facts and the Beautiful Sea even as it is written in the Law of the
Pilgrimage
The tired feet of the Traveler left now the rough hot floor of the
desert for a soft cool carpet of velvet grass all inwrought with
blossoms that filled the air with fragrance Over his head tall trees
gently shook their glistening shadowy leaves while sweet voiced birds
of rare and wondrous plumage flitted from bough to bough Across a sky
of deepest blue fleets of fairy cloud ships light as feathery down
floatedfloateddrifting lazily as though piloted only by the wind
their pilot slept All about him as he walked multitudes of sunlight
and shadow fairies danced gaily hand in hand And over the shimmering
surface of the Sea a thousand thousand fairy waves ran joyously one
after the other from the sky line to the pebbly beach making liquid
music clearer and softer than the softest of clear toned bells
And there it was in that wondrously beautiful place the
OuterEdgeOfThings that the Pilgrim found fashioned of sheerest
white with lofty dome towering spires and piercing minarets lifting
out of the living green the Temple of Truth
Illustration  see king003png
In reverent awe the Pilgrim stood before the sacred object of his
Pilgrimage
At last with earnest step the worshiper approached the holy edifice
But when he would have passed through the high arched door his way was
barred by one whose garments were white even as the whiteness of the
Temple whose eyes were clear even as the skies and whose face shone
even as the shining Beautiful Sea
The Pilgrim hesitating spoke You are
The other answered in a voice that was even as the soft wind that
stirred the leaves of the forest I am Thyself
Then the PilgrimAnd your office
I am the appointed Keeper of the Temple of Truth save by my permission
none may enter here
Cried the Pilgrim eagerly But I I may enter Surely I have fulfilled
The Law Surely I have paid The Price
What law have you fulfilled What price have you paid gently asked he
in the garments of white
Proudly now the other answered I have accomplished alone the long
journey through the Desert of Facts Alone I have endured the days under
the sky of brass alone I have borne the awful solitude of the nights I
was not drawn aside by the lovely scenes that tempted me I was not
turned back by the dreadful Shapes that threatened me And so I have
attained the OuterEdgeOfThings
You have indeed fulfilled The Law said he of the shining face And
The Price
The Pilgrim answered sadly I left behind all things dearest to the
heart of manWealth of Traditions inherited from the Long Ago Holy
Prejudices painfully gathered through the ages of the past Sacred
Opinions Customs Favors and Honors of the World that is in the times
that are
You have indeed paid The Price said the soft voice of the other but
still still there is one thing more
And the one thing more asked the Pilgrim I knew not that there
could be one thing more
The Keeper of the Temple was silent for a little then said very gently
Is there nothing O Hadji that you would ask Thyself
Then all at once the Pilgrim understood Said he slowly There is still
one thing more Tell me tell meWhy Why The Law of the Pilgrimage
Why the journey so long Why the way so hard Why is the Temple of Truth
here on the OuterEdgeOfThings
And Thyself answered clearly He who lives always within Things can
never worship in Truth Eyes blinded by the fog of Things cannot see
Truth Ears deafened by the din of Things cannot hear Truth Brains
bewildered by the whirl of Things cannot think Truth Hearts deadened by
the weight of Things cannot feel Truth Throats choked by the dust of
Things cannot speak Truth Therefore O Hadji is the Temple of Truth
here on the OuterEdgeOfThings therefore is The Law of the
Pilgrimage
And The Price asked the Pilgrim It was so great a price Why
Thyself answered Found you no bones in the Desert Found you no graves
by the way
The other replied I saw the Desert white with bonesI found the way
set among many graves
And the hands of the deadasked Thyself in that voice so like the
wind that stirred the leaves of the forestAnd the hands of the dead
And the Pilgrim answered now with understanding The hands of the dead
held fast to their treasuresheld fast to their Wealth of Traditions
to their Holy Prejudices to the Sacred Opinions Customs Favors and
Honors of Men
Then Thyself the appointed Keeper of the Temple of Truth went quietly
aside from the path With slow and reverent step with bowed uncovered
head the Pilgrim crossed the threshold and through the high arched
doorway entered the sacred corridors
But within the Temple before approaching the altar with his offering
the Pilgrim was constrained to retire to The Quiet Room there to spend
the hours until a new day in prayerful meditation It was there that
this Tale of The Uncrowned King came to himcame to him at the end of
his long pilgrimage across the Desert of Factscame to him after he had
paid The Price after he had fulfilled The Law after he had asked of
Thyself the Keeper of the Temple Why
There in The Quiet Room in the Temple of Truth on the
OuterEdgeOfThings the Voices to the Pilgrim told this Tale of The
Uncrowned King
AND THE FIRST VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF THE WAVES
Illustration And the First Voice was the Voice of the Waves see
king004png
It was nearing the fall of day when first the Pilgrim laid himself to
meditate upon his couch in The Quiet Room
Without the Temple the tall trees rustled softly their glossy leaves
and over the flowerfigured carpet of green the sunlight and shadow
fairies danced along the lanes of gold High in the blue above the
fairy cloudfleets were driftingdriftingidly floating Over the
Beautiful Sea the glad wave fairies ran one after the other from beyond
the far horizon to the sandy shore
In The Quiet Room where the Pilgrim lay it was very very still Only
the liquid music of the waves came through the open windowcame to the
Pilgrim clearer and sweeter than the sweetest notes from clear toned
bells
And after a little there was in the music of the waves a Voice
Said the Voice To thee O Hadji I come from the Beautiful Sea the
interminable unfathomable sea that begins at the OuterEdgeOfThings
and stretches away into Neverness I speak from out the Deeps Beneath I
tell of the Great That Is I am a Voice of Life O Hadji and mine it is
to begin for you The Tale of The Uncrowned King
And this is the beginning of the Tale that the Voice of the Waves began
Very great and very wonderful O Hadji is the Land of Allthetime Very
great and very wonderful is the Royal City Daybyday Beautiful in
Allthetime are the lakes and rivers the mountains plains and streams
Beautiful in Daybyday are the groves and gardens the drives and parks
the harbors and canals Countless in this Royal City are the palaces
Without number are the peoplewithout number and of many races
languages and names
But amid the countless palaces in this marvelous city Daybyday there is
one Temple onlyonly one For the numberless people of the many races
languages and names there is but one Godonly one About this Royal
City there is no Wall For the King of Allthetime who dwells in
Daybyday there is no Crown
But the days that were were not as the days that are O Hadji and
therefore is this Tale
In the long ago olden days when King WhatSoeverYouthink ruled over
the Land of Allthetime there were in this Royal City Daybyday
religions manyas many quite as the races languages and names of the
people Many then were the temples built by the many followers of the
many religions to their many gods For you must know that King
WhatSoeverYouthink was of all wise kings that ever were or will be
the very wisest and therefore permitted his subjects to worship whom
they would
Always in the city streets there were vast throngs of people passing to
and fro among the temples bearing offerings and singing praises to the
gods of their choice for the chiefest occupation of the dwellers in
Daybyday was then as it is now the old old occupation of worship
Some of the temples it is true were at times quite deserted while in
others there was not room for the multitudes but even in the nearly
empty temples the priests and beggars always remained for in that age
the people of Daybyday changed often their gods nor followed any very
far
And you must know too O Hadji that in those long ago olden daysthe
days of the reign of WhatSoeverYouthink there was for the Ruler of
Allthetime a Crown and that of all the wonders in that wonderful land
this Crown was the most wonderful More dear to the people of Daybyday
than their city itself more precious than their splendid temples more
sacred even than their many gods was thisthe Crown of their King
It was so first because the Crown was extremely old From the
beginning of the reign of the Royal Family Everyone no one knows how
many thousands of ages ago it had passed from king to king even until
that day
It was so second because the Crown was exceedingly valuable From the
very beginning of the beginning each ruler had in turn added a jewel to
the golden gem encrusted emblem of his rank
It was so third because the Crown was a Magic Crown though no one
then knew its magicthey knew only that its magic was
Therefore again O Hadji is this Tale
Also in those days there was about this Royal City a Walla wall
built so they said on the very foundations of the world so strong
that no force could breach it and so high that the clouds often hid its
towers and battlements Only from the topmost cupola of the Royal Palace
could one see over this mighty barrier Only by the Two Great Gates
could one pass through
And so the good people of Allthetime could all quite clearly see that in
the Royal City Daybyday the precious Magic Crown was as safe as ever
crown could be And it was so O Hadjiit was so The Crown was as safe
as ever crown could beas safe indeed as ever a crown can be
And this too is truth O Hadji that in Daybyday even now you may find
ruins of the many temples and here and there a little of the many gods
Even now you may see where the Great Wall was But of the Crown in
these days there is nothingnothing
And this is how it happenedthis is the way it came to be
King WhatSoeverYouthink was the father of two sons twins they were
and their namesReallyIs and SeemstoBe No one in all the kingdom
could tell them one from the other though the princes themselves knew
that ReallyIs was first born and that when the wise king their
father died it would be for him to occupy the throne to wear the
Crown and rule the Land of Allthetime
One day when the young princes were playing in the palace yard they
discovered by chance an old door that led to the stairway in a tower
Of course they climbed up up up until they stood at last in the
cupola at the very top Far beneath their feet they saw the roofs of the
Royal Palace and the gardens fields and orchards like spots and
splashes of color The walks and courts appeared as lines and squares of
white while the soldiers and servants moved about like tiny animated
dots Reaching away from the palace grounds on every side was the
wonderful city Daybyday so far below that no sound could reach their
ears To their delight the princes found that they could even look down
upon the Great Wall and because there were that day no clouds to shut
out the view they could see far far away over the Land of Allthetime
Illustration   see king005png
Look brother cried SeemstoBe catching ReallyIs by the arm in
quick excitement Look what is that flashing and gleaming in the sun
As he spoke he pointed afar off to the land beyond the river that marks
the end of Allthetime
Im sure I cannot tell answered ReallyIs shading his eyes with his
open hand and gazing long and earnestly in the direction his brother
indicated It looksit looks like a city
It is it is cried SeemstoBe It is the City Sometime in the Land
of Yettocome I remember hearing once the Chief Gardener telling the
Chief Coachman about it and he said that the Chief Cook said that he
heard the Captain of the Guard say that it is far more wonderful than
our own city Daybyday and it must be so ReallyIs for see brother
how the walls shine like polished silver and look Is not that a palace
or a temple blazing so like a ruby flame
Often after that did the twin princes ReallyIs and SeemstoBe climb
the winding stairs in the palace tower and look away over the Great Wall
of Daybyday to the City Sometime in the Land of Yettocome Many were the
hours they spent talking of the marvelous place that so filled the
distance with dazzling splendor And at last when the princes were
quite grown they went before their royal father and asked permission to
visit the city they had seen
Now King WhatSoeverYouthink was very sad when his sons made their
request but nevertheless because he was a wise king he gave his royal
consent and that the brothers might make their journey in comfort
presented to each a priceless horse from the palace stables To
ReallyIs he gave Reality to SeemstoBe he gave Appearance and both
were steeds of noble breeding swift and strong beautiful and proudas
like even as the royal twins their masters
So it came that the two princes bade farewell to their father the King
and rode bravely out of the city Daybyday through the Land of
Allthetime and along the way that leads to the City Sometime in the
Land of Yettocome
And this O Hadji said the Voice of the Waves is all of The Tale of
The Uncrowned King that is given me to tell
The liquid music of the waves came no longer through the open
windowthe voice that was in the music came no more to the Pilgrim in
The Quiet Room Without the Temple the tall trees were stillstill and
silent were the sweetvoiced birds The sunlight and shadow fairies had
danced to the ends of the lanes of golddanced to the very ends and
were gone The feathery cloud ships in the blue above seemed to lie at
anchor and over the surface of the Beautiful Sea no laughing ripples
ran to play on the pebbly beach
The Pilgrim arose from his couch and going to the open window looked
and there in the still fathomless depth of the clear water he saw as
in a crystal glass the wonderful city Daybyday with its canals and
harbors its parks and drives its groves and gardens its palaces and
temples
Then even as the Pilgrim looked quickly the Evening Wind sprang up
Again the tall trees rustled their leaves the cloud ships lifted their
anchors the waves of the Beautiful Sea ran joyously the Vision in the
Deeps Beneath was gone
AND THE SECOND VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF THE EVENING WIND
Illustration And the Second Voice was
The Voice of the Evening Wind see king006png
It was early twilight when the Pilgrim in The Quiet Room returned to his
couch and to his meditations
Without the Temple the last of the day was stealing over the rim of the
world into the mysterious realm of the yesterdays The feathery cloud
ships no longer floated white in the depth of blue but with wide flung
sails of rose and crimson swept over an ocean of amethyst and gold The
ripples that ran on the Beautiful Sea were edged with yellow and scarlet
flame while leaf and blade and flower and bird and all of their
kind and kin were singing their evensong Sweetly softly the choral
anthem stole through the open window into The Quiet Room
And after a little the Pilgrim heard whispering low in the twilight
hymn the Voice of the Evening Wind
Said the Voice To thee O Hadji I come from the Boundless Ocean Above
that begins wherever you are and extends farther away than the farthest
point your thought can reach I speak from out the Deeps Beyond I tell
of the Great That May Be I too am a Voice of Life and mine it is to
continue for you The Tale of The Uncrowned King
And this is the part of the Tale that was told by the Voice of the
Evening Wind
The twin princes ReallyIs and SeemstoBe on their good horses Reality
and Appearance journeyed very pleasantly through the Land of Allthetime
toward the City Sometime in the Land of Yettocome Ever as they went the
Royal travelers saw before them the walls of the city gleaming like
polished silver in the sun and high above the shining walls the great
palace or temple that flamed like a ruby flame Always as they rode the
two talked gaily in glad anticipation of the marvels they would
certainly see of the pleasures they would surely find and of the
delightful adventures that without doubt awaited them So at last they
arrived at the city gate which was a gate all scrolled and patterned
with precious gems
Illustration  see king007png
Fairer than the dreams of angels O Hadji is the City Sometime in the
Land of Yettocome Of such radiant splendors such dazzling brilliancy
such transcending glory there are yet no words fashioned to tell It is
a city in the form and manner of its building of exquisite loveliness
of fairy grace of towering grandeur It is a city in the beauty and
richness of its color all emerald rose and purple all ruby crimson
and gold
As the twin princes of Allthetime rode slowly through the wide jeweled
gate and along the noble streets and stately avenues they exclaimed
aloud with delight and wonder at the enchanting beauty of the scene
More than they had heard at home was true The poorest of the buildings
in Sometime far exceeded in splendor the richest of the palaces in
Daybyday while before the palaces of Sometime ReallyIs and SeemstoBe
stood speechless and amazed They were fairly drunken with the flashing
flaming blazing blinding glory of the sight
The people of Sometime too were exceeding fair and very charming in
their manner and they welcomed the princes from Daybyday with a joyous
welcome answering their questions gladly and escorting them to the
palace of their king For you must know O Hadji that the City
Sometime too is a Royal City the home of Lookingahead who rules over
the Land of Yettocome And King Lookingahead received his noble visitors
with gladness and had great pleasure he said in presenting them to his
two daughters the princesses of Yettocome Fancy and Imagination who
were fairer than any women the princes of Daybyday had ever seen even
in the loveliest of their dreams
For a long happy happy time ReallyIs and SeemstoBe remained in the
City Sometime Every day and every day with the royal princesses Fancy
and Imagination for their guides they rode or drove through the wide
streets and broad avenues walked in the beautiful gardens explored the
shadowy groves or visited the many palaces And in this way it was that
the charming princesses showed to their noble guests all the wonders of
the Royal City of the Realm of Yettocome pointing out for them every
day new beauties finding for them always new pleasures leading them
ever to fresh scenes of enchanting loveliness And in turn the princes
told their fair guides many things of their own city Daybyday in the
Land of Allthetime of the people with their many temples and their many
gods of their father WhatSoeverYouthink and his wise reign But most
of all did they tell of the wonderful Crown so very old so very
valuable and how it was a Magic Crown though no one then knew its
magic but knew only that its magic was
Thus ReallyIs and SeemstoBe learned that the dwellers in Sometime were
unlike the people of Daybyday in many ways but in no way more than
this that they worshiped one god only only one The temple sacred to
this god stood in the very heart of the city which is the very heart of
the land and it was this temple blazing like a ruby flame high above
the shining city walls the princes had seen from the tower of their
palace home
Often very often did the four young people visit this shrine in
Sometime with rich offerings to the god Itmightbe
But there came a time at last when returning from a long ramble through
the city ReallyIs and SeemstoBe were met at the palace door by a
royal messenger from home with the word that King WhatSoeverYouthink
was dead and that the princes must hasten back to Daybyday where
ReallyIs would be crowned with the Magic Crown and become the Ruler of
Allthetime
All was hurry and confusion in the palace of Lookingahead as the guests
made swift preparations for their journey Quickly the word went
throughout the city and many charming people came to express regret to
sympathize and to bid the young men goodspeed and safe going on their
homeward way The princesses Fancy and Imagination were very sad at
losing their pleasant companions and the Chief High Priest of the
Temple commanded services and offerings extraordinary to the god
Itmightbe
And this O Hadji whispered the Voice of the Evening Wind is all of
The Tale of The Uncrowned King that is given me to tell
The evening song of leaf and blade and flower and bird and all their
kind and kin ceased to come through the open window into The Quiet
Room The low Voice of the Evening Wind no longer whispered to the
Pilgrim as he lay upon his couch Without the Temple the eventide was
passing from over the silent land and over the silent sea
For a little the Pilgrim waited then rising from his couch again he
went to the open window and lo in the evening sky he saw the City
Sometime in the Land of Yettocome All the wondrous castles and palaces
were there marvelous in their beauty glorious in their splendor
dazzling in their colors of emerald rose and purple of ruby crimson
and gold From spire and dome cupola and turret tower and battlement
the lights flashed and gleamed while the Pilgrim looked in wonder and
in awe And high above the city walls that shone as burnished silver in
the sun rose the temple flaming like a ruby flamethe temple sacred to
the god Itmightbe
Slowly slowly the last of the twilight passed Slowly the graceful
lines the proud forms the majestic piles of the city meltedmelted
blurred and were lost even as are lost the form and loveliness of a snow
flake on the sleeve Slowly slowly the glorious colors faded as fade
the flowers at the touch of frost The lights went out The darkness
came The city that is fairer than an angels dream was gone
AND THE THIRD VOICE WAS THE VOICE OF THE NIGHT
Illustration And the Third Voice was
The Voice of the Night see king008png
It was full night when the Pilgrim turned again to seek his couch
Without the Temple it was very stilldark and still Very still was it
within The Quiet Room and the darkness that came stealing through the
open window was a thick and heavy darkness The Pilgrim lay upon his
couch staring with blank unseeing eyes into a blackness wherein there
was not even a spot of gray to show where the window was
And after a little there came out of the heavy darkness the sad sad
Voice of the Night
Said the Voice To thee O Hadji I come from the Limitless Realm of
the Past that begins this moment and reaches back even beyond the day of
all beginnings I speak from the Deeps Above I tell of the Great That
Was I also am a Voice of Life and mine it is to tell you yet more of
The Tale of The Uncrowned King
And this is the part of the Tale that was told by the Voice of the
Night
Now it happened as things sometime so happen that ReallyIs lingered
over long saying goodbye to his friends in the City Sometime in the
Land of Yettocome and that when he had lingered long with his friends
he stayed yet longer with the beautiful princess Imagination
So it was that while the prince was promising many promises and
receiving in turn promises as many his brother SeemstoBe mounted and
was well started on his journey before the heir to the throne of
Allthetime was in the saddle With the last goodbye spoken to his royal
friends the last promise promised to the fair princess and the last
farewell waved to the charming people ReallyIs urged his horse fast
and faster thinking thus to overtake his brother But very soon
ReallyIs found that fast as he rode his good horse Reality SeemstoBe
on Appearance rode faster Greater and greater grew the distance between
the two princesfarther and farther ahead rode SeemstoBe until at
last when the distance between them was such that he could no longer
see his brother ReallyIs the rightful heir to the throne of
Allthetime understood that SeemstoBe was riding to win the Crown
For you must not forget O Hadji said the sad Voice of the Night
that no one in Daybyday could tell the twins ReallyIs and SeemstoBe
one from the other and therefore you see the prince who first reached
the Royal City would surely be proclaimed king
Hard and fast fast and hard rode the two who raced for the Crown of
Allthetime But always Appearance the horse of SeemstoBe proved faster
than Reality the horse of ReallyIs and so the prince who was first
born rode far behind
Now just this side of the river that marks the end of the Land of
Allthetime the road divides the way to the left leading to the Brazen
Gate called Chance and the other to the right going straight to the
Golden Gate Opportunity And just here it is at the parting of the
ways that Wisdom lives in his little house beside the road
When ReallyIs in turn arrived at this place he dismounted from his
tired horse and approaching the little house asked of Wisdom if he had
seen one pass that way riding in great haste
Aye that I have replied Wisdom with a smile that I have young
sir and many would say that it was yourself who rode so hard
It was my brother good sir replied the prince May I ask which way
he went and how far he rides ahead
The old man pointing answered He took the road to the left there and
he rides so far ahead that you cannot now overtake him this side the
city walls
At least I must try to overtake him answered the prince and
thanking the old man he turned quickly to mount his horse again
But Wisdom cried Why so fast Why so fast Is not your brothers name
SeemstoBe And are not you ReallyIs the rightful heir to the throne
of Allthetime
It is indeed so sir replied the young man sadly I am ReallyIs I
was born before my brother SeemstoBe and am therefore the rightful
heir to the Crown Our father King WhatSoeverYouthink is dead and I
must hasten or my brother will be crowned king for as you see the
people cannot tell us one from the other
Then said Wisdom But you will gain nothing by haste oh
ReallyIsnothing but time and there is much of greater value than
time to a King of Allthetime Even now is SeemstoBe entering the city
Even now is he by the people being hailed King Therefore tarry a while
before you act and listen to my words
So it was that ReallyIs paused on his journey to sit awhile with Wisdom
in the little house by the side of the road
Then did Wisdom take from his shelves many a ponderous time worn volume
and read to the prince History Prophecy and Law revealing to him thus
the Secret of the Magic of the Crown of Allthetime
And from the last volume that which Wisdom read to ReallyIs was this
Be it known O whosoever readeth that if any prince of the royal
family Everyone enter the city Daybyday through the Brazen Gate called
Chance he shall be forever held unworthy of the throne and crown In
the sacred Law of All the Ages it is written that a King of Allthetime
may enter the Royal City only through the Golden Gate Opportunity
Illustration  see king009png
Wisdom closed the book and returned this volume also to its place
ReallyIs arose to go
And what now is your mind young sir asked Wisdom kindly
Then ReallyIs answered royally This you have taught me O
Wisdomthis is my mind The Crown is not the kingdom nor is one King
because he wears a crown
Then did Wisdom with bowed head salute the True King And your will
Sire may I know your Majestys will
King ReallyIs replied My will is this that I myself obey the sacred
Law of The Ages
And your brother Sire your brother SeemstoBe
I will pity SeemstoBe replied The King in sorrow I will have much
pity for that poor foolish one
And peace will dwell in thy heart O King of Allthetime said Wisdom
true peace and understanding
Then ReallyIs alone and unattended rode slowly on his way
And SeemstoBe who rode so fast and so far ahead of ReallyIs and who
