If it be no small task for a man of the most favored antecedents and
the most fortunate surroundings to rise above mediocrity in a great
nation it is surely a more remarkable achievement for a man of the
very humblest origin possible to humanity in any country in any age of
the world in the face of obstacles seemingly insurmountable to win
high honors and rewards to retain for more than a generation the
respect of good men in many lands and to be deemed worthy of
enrolment among his countrys great men Such a man was Frederick
Douglass and the example of one who thus rose to eminence by sheer
force of character and talents that neither slavery nor caste
proscription could crush must ever remain as a shining illustration
of the essential superiority of manhood to environment Circumstances
made Frederick Douglass a slave but they could not prevent him from
becoming a freeman and a leader among mankind
The early life of Douglass as detailed by himself from the platform
in vigorous and eloquent speech and as recorded in the three volumes
written by himself at different periods of his career is perhaps the
completest indictment of the slave system ever presented at the bar of
public opinion Fanny Kembles Journal of a Residence on a Georgian
Plantation kept by her in the very year of Douglasss escape from
bondage but not published until 1863 too late to contribute anything
to the downfall of slavery is a singularly clear revelation of
plantation life from the standpoint of an outsider entirely unbiased
by American prejudice Frederick Douglasss Narrative is the same
story told from the inside They coincide in the main facts and in
the matter of detail like the two slightly differing views of a
stereoscopic picture they bring out into bold relief the real
character of the peculiar institution Uncle Toms Cabin lent to
the structure of fact the decorations of humor a dramatic plot and
characters to whose fate the touch of creative genius gave a living
interest But after all it was not Uncle Tom nor Topsy nor Miss
Ophelia nor Eliza nor little Eva that made the book the power it
proved to stir the hearts of men but the great underlying tragedy
then already rapidly approaching a bloody climax
Frederick Douglass was born in February l8l7as nearly as the date
could be determined in after years when it became a matter of public
interestat Tuckahoe near Easton Talbot County on the eastern
shore of Maryland a barren and povertystricken district which
possesses in the birth of Douglass its sole title to distinction His
mother was a negro slave tall erect and wellproportioned of a
deep black and glossy complexion with regular features and manners
of a natural dignity and sedateness Though a field hand and compelled
to toil many hours a day she had in some mysterious way learned to
read being the only person of color in Tuckahoe slave or free who
possessed that accomplishment His father was a white man It was in
the nature of things that in after years attempts should be made to
analyze the sources of Douglasss talent and that the question should
be raised whether he owed it to the black or the white half of his
mixed ancestry But Douglass himself who knew his own mother and
grandmother ascribed such powers as he possessed to the negro half of
his blood and as to it certainly he owed the experience which gave
his antislavery work its peculiar distinction and value he doubtless
believed it only fair that the credit for what he accomplished should
go to those who needed it most and could justly be proud of it He
never knew with certainty who his white father was for the exigencies
of slavery separated the boy from his mother before the subject of
his paternity became of interest to him and in after years his white
father never claimed the honor which might have given him a place in
history
Douglasss earliest recollections centered around the cabin of his
grandmother Betsey Bailey who seems to have been something of a
privileged character on the plantation being permitted to live with
her husband Isaac in a cabin of their own charged with only the
relatively light duty of looking after a number of young children
mostly the offspring of her own five daughters and providing for her
own support
It is impossible in a work of the scope of this to go into very
elaborate detail with reference to this period of Douglasss life
however interesting it might be The real importance of his life to us
of another generation lies in what he accomplished toward the worlds
progress which he only began to influence several years after his
escape from slavery Enough ought to be stated however to trace
his development from slave to freeman and his preparation for the
platform where he secured his hearing and earned his fame
Douglass was born the slave of one Captain Aaron Anthony a man of
some consequence in eastern Maryland the manager or chief clerk of
one Colonel Lloyd the head for that generation of an old exceedingly
wealthy and highly honored family in Maryland the possessor of a
stately mansion and one of the largest and most fertile plantations in
the State Captain Anthony though only the satellite of this great
man himself owned several farms and a number of slaves At the age of
seven Douglass was taken from the cabin of his grandmother at Tuckahoe
to his masters residence on Colonel Lloyds plantation
Up to this time he had never to his recollection seen his mother
All his impressions of her were derived from a few brief visits made
to him at Colonel Lloyds plantation most of them at night These
fleeting visits of the mother were important events in the life of the
child now no longer under the care of his grandmother but turned
over to the tender mercies of his masters cook with whom he does not
seem to have been a favorite His mother died when he was eight or
nine years old Her son did not see her during her illness nor learn
of it until after her death It was always a matter of grief to him
that he did not know her better and that he could not was one of the
sins of slavery that he never forgave
On Colonel Lloyds plantation Douglass spent four years of the slave
life of which his graphic description on the platform stirred humane
hearts to righteous judgment of an unrighteous institution It is
enough to say that this lad with keen eyes and susceptible feelings
was an eyewitness of all the evils to which slavery gave birth Its
extremes of luxury and misery could be found within the limits of one
estate He saw the field hand driven forth at dawn to labor until
dark He beheld every natural affection crushed when inconsistent with
slavery or warped and distorted to fit the necessities and promote
the interests of the institution He heard the unmerited strokes of
the lash on the backs of others and felt them on his own In the wild
songs of the slaves he read beneath their senseless jargon or their
fulsome praise of old master the often unconscious note of grief
and despair He perceived too the debasing effects of slavery upon
master and slave alike crushing all semblance of manhood in the
one and in the other substituting passion for judgment caprice for
justice and indolence and effeminacy for the more virile virtues of
freemen Doubtless the gentle hand of time will some time spread
the veil of silence over this painful past but while we are still
gathering its evil aftermath it is well enough that we do not forget
the origin of so many of our civic problems
When Douglass was ten years old he was sent from the Lloyd plantation
to Baltimore to live with one Hugh Auld a relative of his master
Here he enjoyed the high privilege for a slave of living in the
house with his masters family In the capacity of house boy it was
his duty to run errands and take care of a little white boy Tommy
Auld the son of his mistress for the time being Mrs Sophia Auld
Mrs Auld was of a religious turn of mind and from hearing her
reading the Bible aloud frequently curiosity prompted the boy to ask
her to teach him to read She complied and found him an apt pupil
until her husband learned of her unlawful and dangerous conduct and
put an end to the instruction But the evil was already done and the
seed thus sown brought forth fruit in the after career of the orator
and leader of men The mere fact that his master wished to prevent his
learning made him all the more eager to acquire knowledge In after
years even when most bitter in his denunciation of the palpable evils
of slavery Douglass always acknowledged the debt he owed to this good
lady who innocently broke the laws and at the same time broke the
chains that held a mind in bondage
Douglass lived in the family of Hugh Auld at Baltimore for seven
years During this time the achievement that had the greatest
influence upon his future was his learning to read and write His
mistress had given him a start His own efforts gained the rest He
carried in his pocket a bluebacked Websters Spelling Book and as
occasion offered induced his young white playmates by the bribes
of childhood to give him lessons in spelling When he was about
thirteen he began to feel deeply the moral yoke of slavery and to
seek for knowledge of the means to escape it One book seems to have
had a marked influence upon his life at this epoch He obtained
somehow a copy of The Columbian Orator containing some of the
choicest masterpieces of English oratory in which he saw liberty
praised and oppression condemned and the glowing periods of Pitt and
Fox and Sheridan and our own Patrick Henry stirred to life in the
heart of this slave boy the genius for oratory which did not burst
forth until years afterward The worldly wisdom of denying to slaves
the key to knowledge is apparent when it is said that Douglass first
learned from a newspaper that there were such people as abolitionists
who were opposed to human bondage and sought to make all men free
At about this same period Douglasss mind fell under religious
influences He was converted professed faith in Jesus Christ and
began to read the Bible He had dreamed of liberty before he now
prayed for it and trusted in God But with the shrewd common sense
which marked his whole life and saved it from shipwreck in more
than one instance he never forgot that God helps them that help
themselves and so never missed an opportunity to acquire the
knowledge that would prepare him for freedom and give him the means of
escape from slavery
Douglass had learned to read partly from childish curiosity and the
desire to be able to do what others around him did but it was with a
definite end in view that he learned to write By the slave code
it was unlawful for a slave to go beyond the limits of his own
neighborhood without the written permission of his master Douglasss
desire to write grew mainly out of the fact that in order to escape
from bondage which he had early determined to do he would probably
need such a pass as this written permission was termed and could
write it himself if he but knew how His master for the time being
kept a shipyard and in this and neighboring establishments of
the same kind the boy spent much of his time He noticed that the
carpenters after dressing pieces of timber marked them with certain
letters to indicate their positions in the vessel By asking questions
of the workmen he learned the names of these letters and their
significance He got up writing matches with sticks upon the ground
with the little white boys copied the italics in his spellingbook
and in the secrecy of the attic filled up all the blank spaces of his
young masters old copybooks In time he learned to write and thus
again demonstrated the power of the mind to overleap the bounds that
men set for it and work out the destiny to which God designs it
II
It was the curious fate of Douglass to pass through almost every phase
of slavery as though to prepare him the more thoroughly for his
future career Shortly after he went to Baltimore his master Captain
Anthony died intestate and his property was divided between his two
children Douglass with the other slaves was part of the personal
estate and was sent for to be appraised and disposed of in the
division He fell to the share of Mrs Lucretia Auld his masters
daughter who sent him back to Baltimore where after a months
absence he resumed his life in the household of Mrs Hugh Auld
the sisterinlaw of his legal mistress Owing to a family
misunderstanding he was taken in March 1833 from Baltimore back to
St Michaels
His mistress Lucretia Auld had died in the mean time and the new
household in which he found himself with Thomas Auld and his second
wife Rowena at its head was distinctly less favorable to the slave
boys comfort than the home where he had lived in Baltimore Here he
saw hardships of the life in bondage that had been less apparent in a
large city It is to be feared that Douglass was not the ideal slave
governed by the meek and lowly spirit of Uncle Tom He seems by his
own showing to have manifested but little appreciation of the wise
oversight the thoughtful care and the freedom from responsibility
with which slavery claimed to hedge round its victims and he was
inclined to spurn the rod rather than to kiss it A tendency to
insubordination due partly to the freer life he had led in Baltimore
got him into disfavor with a master easily displeased and not
proving sufficiently amenable to the discipline of the home
plantation he was sent to a certain celebrated negrobreaker by the
name of Edward Covey one of the poorer whites who as overseers and
slavecatchers and in similar unsavory capacities earned a living as
parasites on the system of slavery Douglass spent a year under Coveys
ministrations and his life there may be summed up in his own words
I had neither sufficient time in which to eat nor to sleep except on
Sundays The overwork and the brutal chastisements of which I was the
victim combined with that evergnawing and souldestroying thought
I am a slavea slave for life rendered me a living embodiment of
mental and physical wretchedness
But even all this did not entirely crush the indomitable spirit of a
man destined to achieve his own freedom and thereafter to help win
freedom for a race In August 1834 after a particularly atrocious
beating which left him wounded and weak from loss of blood Douglass
escaped the vigilance of the slavebreaker and made his way back to
his own master to seek protection The master who would have lost
his slaves wages for a year if he had broken the contract with
Covey before the years end sent Douglass back to his taskmaster
Anticipating the most direful consequences Douglass made the
desperate resolution to resist any further punishment at Coveys
hands After a fight of two hours Covey gave up his attempt to whip
Frederick and thenceforth laid hands on him no more That Covey did
not invoke the law which made death the punishment of the slave who
resisted his master was probably due to shame at having been worsted
by a negro boy or to the prudent consideration that there was no
profit to be derived from a dead negro Strength of character
reenforced by strength of muscle thus won a victory over brute force
that secured for Douglass comparative immunity from abuse during the
remaining months of his years service with Covey
The next year 1835 Douglass was hired out to a Mr William Freeland
who lived near St Michaels a gentleman who did not forget justice
or humanity so far as they were consistent with slavery even
in dealing with bondservants Here Douglass led a comparatively
comfortable life He had enough to eat was not overworked and found
the time to conduct a surreptitious Sundayschool where he tried to
help others by teaching his fellowslaves to read the Bible
III
The manner of Douglasss escape from Maryland was never publicly
disclosed by him until the war had made slavery a memory and
the slavecatcher a thing of the past It was the theory of the
antislavery workers of the time that the publication of the details
of escapes or rescues from bondage seldom reached the ears of those
who might have learned thereby to do likewise but merely furnished
the master class with information that would render other escapes
more difficult and bring suspicion or punishment upon those who had
assisted fugitives That this was no idle fear there is abundant
testimony in the annals of the period But in later years when there
was no longer any danger of unpleasant consequences and when it had
become an honor rather than a disgrace to have assisted a distressed
runaway Douglass published in detail the story of his flight It
would not compare in dramatic interest with many other celebrated
escapes from slavery or imprisonment He simply masqueraded as a
sailor borrowed a sailors protection or certificate that he
belonged to the navy took the train to Baltimore in the evening and
rode in the negro car until he reached New York City There were many
anxious moments during this journey The protection he carried
described a man somewhat different from him but the conductor did not
examine it carefully Fear clutched at the fugitives heart whenever
he neared a State border line He saw several persons whom he knew
but if they recognized him or suspected his purpose they made no
sign A little boldness a little address and a great deal of good
luck carried him safely to his journeys end
Douglass arrived in New York on September 4 1838 having attained
only a few months before what would have been in a freeman his legal
majority But though landed in a free State he was by no means a
free man He was still a piece of property and could be reclaimed
by the laws aid if his whereabouts were discovered While local
sentiment at the North afforded a measure of protection to fugitives
and few were ever returned to bondage compared with the number that
escaped yet the fear of recapture was ever with them darkening their
lives and impeding their pursuit of happiness
But even the partial freedom Douglass had achieved gave birth to a
thousand delightful sensations In his autobiography he describes this
dawn of liberty thus
A new world had opened up to me I lived more in one day than in a
year of my slave life I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den
of hungry lions My chains were broken and the victory brought me
unspeakable joy
But one cannot live long on joy and while his chains were broken
he was not beyond the echo of their clanking He met on the streets
within a few hours after his arrival in New York a man of his own
color who informed him that New York was full of Southerners at that
season of the year and that slavehunters and spies were numerous
that old residents of the city were not safe and that any recent
fugitive was in imminent danger After this cheerful communication
Douglasss informant left him evidently fearing that Douglass himself
might be a slavehunting spy There were negroes base enough to play
this role In a sailor whom he encountered he found a friend This
Good Samaritan took him home for the night and accompanied him next
day to a Mr David Ruggles a colored man the secretary of the New
York Vigilance Committee and an active antislavery worker Mr Ruggles
kept him concealed for several days during which time the woman
Douglass loved a free woman came on from Baltimore and they were
married He had no money in his pocket and nothing to depend upon but
his hands which doubtless seemed to him quite a valuable possession
as he knew they had brought in an income of several hundred dollars a
year to their former owner
Douglasss new friends advised him to go to New Bedford
Massachusetts where whaling fleets were fitted out and where he
might hope to find work at his trade of shipcalker It was believed
too that he would be safer there as the antislavery sentiment was
considered too strong to permit a fugitive slaves being returned to
the South
When Douglass accompanied by his wife arrived in New Bedford a
Mr Nathan Johnson a colored man to whom he had been recommended
received him kindly gave him shelter and sympathy and lent him a
small sum of money to redeem his meagre baggage which had been held
by the stagedriver as security for an unpaid balance of the fare to
New Bedford In his autobiography Douglass commends Mr Johnson for
his noblehearted hospitality and manly character
In New York Douglass had changed his name in order the better to hide
his identity from any possible pursuer Douglasss name was another
tie that bound him to his race He has been called Douglass by the
writer because that was the name he took for himself as he did his
education and his freedom and as Douglass he made himself famous
As a slave he was legally entitled to but one nameFrederick From
his grandfather Isaac Bailey a freeman he had derived the surname
Bailey His mother with unconscious sarcasm had called the little
slave boy Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey The bearer of this
imposing string of appellations had with a finer sense of fitness
cut it down to Frederick Bailey In New York he had called himself
Frederick Johnson but finding when he reached New Bedford that a
considerable portion of the colored population of the city already
rejoiced in this familiar designation he fell in with the suggestion
of his host who had been reading Scotts Lady of the Lake
and traced an analogy between the runaway slave and the fugitive
chieftain that the new freeman should call himself Douglass
after the noble Scot of that name Douglas The choice proved not
inappropriate for this modern Douglass fought as valiantly in his own
cause and with his own weapons as ever any Douglass Douglas fought
with flashing steel in border foray
Here then in a New England town Douglass began the life of a
freeman from which relieved now of the incubus of slavery he soon
emerged into the career for which in the providence of God he seemed
by his multiform experience to have been especially fitted He did not
find himself even in Massachusetts quite beyond the influence of
slavery While before the law of the State he was the equal of any
other man caste prejudice prevented him from finding work at his
trade of calker and he therefore sought employment as a laborer This
he found easily and for three years worked at whatever his hands
found to do The hardest toil was easy to him the heaviest burdens
were light for the money that he earned went into his own pocket
If it did not remain there long he at least had the satisfaction of
spending it and of enjoying what it purchased
During these three years he was learning the lesson of liberty and
unconsciously continuing his training for the work of an antislavery
