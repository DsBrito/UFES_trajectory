I was spending the Spring at Sienna Occupied all day long with
meticulous researches among the city archives I used after supper to
take an evening walk along the wild road leading to Monte Oliveto where
I would encounter in the twilight huge white oxen under ponderous yokes
dragging a rustic wain with wheels of solid timberall unchanged since
the times of old Evander The church bells knelled the peaceful ending
of the day while the purple shades of night descended sadly and
majestically on the low chain of neighbouring hills The black squadrons
of the rooks had already sought their nests about the city walls but
relieved against the opalescent sky a single sparrowhawk still hung
floating with motionless wings above a solitary ilex tree
I moved forward to confront the silence and solitude and the mild
terrors that lowered before me in the growing dusk The tide of darkness
rose by imperceptible degrees and drowned the landscape The infinite of
starry eyes winked in the sky while in the gloom below the fireflies
spangled the bushes with their trembling lovelights
These living sparks cover all the Roman Campagna and the plains of
Umbria and Tuscany on May nights I had watched them in former days on
the Appian Way round the tomb of Ccilia Metellatheir playground for
two thousand years now I found them dancing the selfsame dance in the
land of St Catherine and of Pia de Tolomei at the gates of Sienna
that most melancholy and most fascinating of cities All along my path
they quivered in the bents and brushwood chasing one another and ever
and anon at the call of desire tracing above the roadway the fiery
arch of their darting flight
On the white ribbon of the road in these clear Spring nights the only
person I used to encounter was the Reverend Father Adone Doni who at
the time was like myself working in the old Academy degli Intronati
I had taken an instant liking for the Cordelier in question a man who
grown grey in study still preserved the cheerful facile humour of a
simple unlettered countryman He was very willing to converse and I
greatly relished his bland speech his cultivated yet artless way of
thought his look of old Silenus purged at the baptismal font the play
of his passions at once keen and refined the strange alluring
personality that informed the whole man Assiduous at the library he
was also a frequent visitor to the marketplace halting for choice in
front of the peasant girls who sell oranges and listening to their
unconventional remarks He was learning he would say from their lips
the true Lingua Toscana
All I knew of his past life about which he never spoke was that he was
born at Viterbo of a noble but miserably impoverished family that he
had studied the humanities and theology at Rome as a young man had
joined the Franciscans of Assisi where he worked at the Archives and
had had difficulties on questions of faith with his ecclesiastical
superiors Indeed I thought I noticed myself a tendency in the Father
towards peculiar views He was a man of religion and a man of science
but not without certain eccentricities under either aspect He believed
in God on the evidence of Holy Scripture and in accordance with the
teachings of the Church and laughed at those simple philosophers who
believed in Him on their own account without being under any obligation
to do so So far he was well within the bounds of orthodoxy it was in
connection with the Devil that he professed peculiar opinions He held
the Devil to be wicked but not absolutely wicked and considered that
the fiends innate imperfection must always bar him from attaining to
the perfection of evil He believed he discerned some symptoms of
goodness in the obscure manifestations of Satans activity and without
venturing to put it in so many words augured from these the final
redemption of the pensive Archangel after the consummation of the ages
These little eccentricities of thought and temperament which had
separated him from the rest of the world and thrown him back upon a
solitary existence afforded me amusement He had wits enough all he
lacked was common sense and appreciation of ordinary everyday things
His life was divided between phantoms of the past and dreams of the
future the actual present was utterly foreign to his notions For his
political ideas these came simultaneously from antique Santa Maria
degli Angeli and the revolutionary secret societies of London and were
a combination of Christian and socialist But he was no fanatic his
contempt for human reason was too complete for him to attach great
importance to his own share in it The government of states appeared to
him in the light of a huge practical joke at which he would laugh
quietly and composedly as a man of taste should Judges civil and
criminal caused him surprise while he looked on the military classes
in a spirit of philosophical toleration
I was not long in discovering some flagrant contradictions in his mental
attitude He longed with all the charity of his gentle heart for the
reign of universal peace Yet at the same time he had a penchant for
civil war and held in high esteem that Farinata degli Uberti who loved
his native Florence so boldly and so well that he constrained her by
force and fraud making the Arbia run red with Florentine blood the
while to will and think precisely what he willed and thought himself
For all that the Reverend Father Adone Doni was a tenderhearted
dreamer of dreams It was on the spiritual authority of St Peters
chair he counted to establish in this world the kingdom of God He
believed the Paraclete was leading the Popes along a road unknown to
themselves Therefore he had nothing but deferential words for the
Roaring Lamb of Sinigaglia and the Opportunist Eagle of
Carpineto as it was his custom to designate Pius IX and Leo XIII
respectively
Agreeable as was the Reverend Fathers conversation to me I used out
of respect for his freedom of action and my own to avoid showing myself
too assiduous in seeking his society inside the city walls while on his
side he observed an exquisite discretion towards myself But in our
walks abroad we frequently managed to meet as if by accident Half a
league outside the Porta Romana the high road traverses a hollow way
between melancholy uplands on either hand relieved only by a few gloomy
larches Under the clayey slope of the northern escarpment and close by
the roadside a dry well rears its light canopy of open ironwork
At this spot I would encounter the Reverend Father Adone Doni almost
every evening seated on the coping of the well his hands buried in the
sleeves of his gown gazing out with mild surprise into the night The
gathering dusk still left it possible to make out on his brighteyed
flatnosed face the habitual expression of timid daring and graceful
irony which was impressed upon it so profoundly At first we merely
exchanged formal good wishes for each others health peace and
happiness Then I would take my place by his side on the old stone
wellhead that bore some traces of carving It was still possible in
full daylight to distinguish a figure with a head bigger than its body
and representing an Angel as seemed indicated by the wings
The Reverend Father never failed to say courteously
Welcome Signore Welcome to the Well of St Clare
One evening I asked him the reason why the well bore the name of this
favourite disciple of St Francis He informed me it was because of a
very edifying little miracle which for all its charm had unfortunately
never found a place in the collection of the Fioretti I begged him to
oblige me by telling it which he proceeded to do in the following
terms
In the days when the poor man of Jesus Christ Francis son of
Bernardone used to journey from town to town teaching holy simplicity
and love he visited Sienna in company with Brother Leo the man of his
own heart But the Siennese a covetous and cruel generation true sons
of the SheWolf on whose milk they boasted themselves to have been
suckled gave a sorry welcome to the holy man who bade them take into
their house two ladies of a perfect beauty to wit Poverty and
Obedience They overwhelmed him with obloquy and mocking laughter and
drove him forth from the city He left the place in the night by the
Porta Romana Brother Leo who tramped alongside spoke up and said to
him
The Siennese have written on the gates of their citySienna opens
her heart to you wider than her doors And nevertheless brother
Francis these same men have shut their hearts against us
And Francis son of Bernardone replied
The fault is with me be sure of that brother Leo little lamb of
God I have not known how to knock at the doors of their hearts
forcefully and skilfully enough I am far below the fellows who set a
bear dancing in the Great Piazza For they draw together a great crowd
by exhibiting the rude coarse beast whilst I that had ladies of
celestial fairness to show them I have attracted no one Brother Leo I
charge you on your holy obedience to say thus to me Brother Francis
you are a poor man without any merit whatsoever a stumblingblock and
a very rock of offence And all the while Brother Leo was hesitating to
obey the holy man suffered grievously within himself As he went on his
murky way his thoughts turned to pleasant Assisi where he had left
behind him his sons in the spirit and Clare daughter of his soul He
knew how Clare was exposed to great tribulations for the love of holy
Poverty And he doubted whether his wellbeloved daughter were not sick
of body and soul and weary of welldoing in the house of St Damian
So sore did these doubts weigh on him that arrived at this spot where
the road enters the hollow way between the hills he seemed to feel his
feet sink into the ground at each step he took He dragged himself as
far as the Well here which was then in its pristine beauty and full of
limpid water and fell exhausted on the wellhead where we are seated at
this moment A long while the man of God remained bent over the mouth of
the well After which lifting up his head he said joyfully to Brother
Leo What think you brother Leo lamb of God I have seen in the
Well
And Brother Leo answered
Brother Francis you saw the moon reflected in the well
My brother replied the Saint of God it is not our sister the Moon
I saw in the well but by the Lord the true countenance of sister
Clare and so pure and shining so bright with a holy joy that all my
doubts were instantly dispelled and it was made plain to me that our
sister enjoys at this present hour the full content God accords his
chosen vessels loading them with the treasures of Poverty
So saying the good St Francis drank a few drops of water in the
hollow of his hand and arose refreshed
And that is why the name of St Clare was given to this Well
Such was the tale told by the Reverend Father Adone Doni
Night after night I returned to find the amiable Cordelier sitting on
the edge of the mystic well I would seat myself by his side and he
would tell over for my benefit some fragment of history known only to
himself He had many delightful stories of the sort to relate being
better read than any one else in the antiquities of his country These
lived again and grew bright and young in his head as if it contained an
intellectual Fountain of Eternal Youth Ever fresh pictures flowed from
his whitefringed lips As he spoke the moonlight bathed his beard in a
silver flood The crickets accompanied the narrators voice with the
shrilling of their wingcases and ever and anon his words uttered in
the softest of all dialects of human speech would be answered by the
fluted plaintive croaking of the frogs which hearkened from across the
roada friendly if apprehensive audience
I left Sienna towards the middle of June and I have never seen the
Reverend Father Adone Doni since He clings to my memory like a figure
in a dream and I have now put into writing the tales he told me on the
road of Monte Oliveto They will be found in the present volume I only
hope they may have retained in their new dress some vestiges of the
grace they had in the telling at the Well of St Clare

Third day of the week at matins
Footnote 1 Partner of the Fathers light light of light and day of
day we break the dusk of night with psalms help us now Thy
suppliants Remove the darkness of our minds scatter the demon hosts
away expel the sin of drowsiness lest we be slack in serving Thee
Fra Mino had raised himself by his humility above his brethren and
still a young man he governed the Monastery of Santa Fiora wisely and
well He was devout and loved long meditations and long prayers
sometimes he had ecstasies After the example of his spiritual father
St Francis he composed songs in the vernacular tongue in celebration
of perfect love which is the love of God And these exercises were
without fault whether of metre or of meaning for had he not studied the
seven liberal Arts at the University of Bologna
Now one evening as he was walking under the cloister arches he felt
his heart filled with trouble and sadness at the remembrance of a lady
of Florence he had loved in the first flower of his youth ere the habit
of St Francis was a safeguard to his flesh He prayed God to drive away
the image nevertheless his heart continued sad within him
The bells he pondered say like the Angels AVE MARIA but their
voice is lost in the mists of heaven On the cloister wall yonder the
Master Perugia delights to honour has painted marvellous well the three
Marys contemplating with a love ineffable the body of the Saviour But
the night has veiled the tears in their eyes and the dumb sobs of their
mouths and I cannot weep with them Yonder Well in the middle of the
cloister garth was covered but now with doves that had come to drink
but these are flown away for they found no water in the hollows of the
carven wellhead And behold Lord my soul falls silent like the bells
is darkened like the holy Marys and runs dry like the well Why Jesus
my God why is my heart arid and dark and dumb when Thou art its
dayspring and the song of birds and the waterbrook flowing from the
hills
Fra Mino dreaded to return to his cell and thinking prayer would dispel
his melancholy and calm his disquiet he passed into the Monastery
Church by the low door leading from the cloister Silence and gloom
filled the building raised more than a hundred and fifty years before
on the foundations of a ruined Roman Temple by the great Margaritone He
traversed the Nave and went and knelt in the Chapel behind the High
Altar dedicated to San Michele whose legend was painted in fresco on
the wall But the dim light of the lamp hanging from the vault was
insufficient to show the Archangel fighting with Satan and weighing
souls in the balance Only the moon shining through the great window
threw a pale ray over the Tomb of San Satiro where it lay under an
arcade to the right of the Altar This tomb in shape resembling the
great vats used at vintage time was more ancient than the Church and in
all respects similar to a Pagan sarcophagus except that the sign of the
Cross was to be seen traced in three different places on its marble
sides
Fra Mino remained for hours prostrate before the Altar but he found it
impossible to pray and at midnight felt himself weighed down under the
same heaviness that overcame Jesus Christs disciples in the Garden of
Gethsemane And lo as he lay there without courage or counsel he saw
as it were a white cloud rise above the tomb of San Satiro and
presently observed that this cloud was made up of a multitude of
cloudlets of which each one was a woman They floated in the dim air
and through their light raiment shone the whiteness of their light
limbs Then Fra Mino saw how among them were goatfooted young men who
were chasing them These were naked and nothing hid the terrifying
ardour of their desires And the nymphs fled away from them while
beneath their racing steps there sprang up flowery meadows and brooks of
water Each time a goatfoot put out his hand to seize one of them a
sallow would shoot up suddenly to hide the nymph in its hollow trunk as
in a cave and the grey leaves shivered with light murmurings and spurts
of mocking laughter
When all the women were hidden in the sallows their goatfooted lovers
sitting on the grass of the newcome meadows breathed in their flutes
of reeds and drew from them sounds to destroy the peace of any creature
of the earth The nymphs were fascinated and soon began to peep out
between the branches and one by one deserting the shady covert drew
near under the irresistible attraction of the music Then the goatmen
rushed upon them with a demoniac fury Folded in the arms of their
ruthless assailants the nymphs strove to keep up a while longer their
raillery and loud laughter but the mirth died on their lips With heads
thrown back and eyes swooning with joy and terror they could only call
upon their mother or scream a shrill You are killing me or keep a
sullen silence
Fra Mino longed to turn his head but he could not and his eyes
remained wide open in spite of himself
Meanwhile the nymphs winding their arms about the goatmens loins
fell to biting and caressing and provoking their hairy lovers and body
intertwined with body they enfolded and bathed them in their tender
flesh that was sweeter and softer and more living than the water of the
brook which ran by them under the sallows
At the sight Fra Mino fell in mind and intention into deadly sin He
desired to be one of these demons half men and half beasts and hold to
his bosom after their carnal fashion the fair lady of Florence he had
loved in the flower of his years and who was now dead
But already the goatmen were scattering through the countryside Some
were busied gathering honey in the hollow trunks of oaks others carving
reeds into the shape of flutes or butting one against the other
crashing their horned brows together Meantime the bodies of the nymphs
sweet wrecks of love lay motionless strewing the meadows Fra Mino lay
groaning on the Chapel flags for so fierce had been the desire of sin
within him that now he was filled full of bitter shame at his own
weakness
Suddenly one of the nymphs chancing as she lay to turn her eyes upon
him cried out
A man a man
And pointing him out to her companions
Look sisters yonder is no goatherd he has no flute of reed beside
him Nor yet do I recognize him for the master of one of those rustic
farmsteads whose gardenclose sloping to the hillside beneath the
vines is guarded by a Priapus hewn out of a stump of beech What would
he among us if he is neither goatherd nor neatherd nor gardener
His looks are harsh and gloomy and I cannot read in his eyes the love
of the gods and goddesses that people the wide sky the woods and
mountains He wears a barbarous habit perhaps he is a Scythian Let us
approach the stranger my sisters and make sure he is not come as a foe
to sully our fountains hew down our trees tear open our hillsides
and betray to cruel men the mystery of our happy lurking places Come
with me Mnais come gle Nera and Meliboea
On on returned Mnais on with our arms in hand
On on all cried in chorus
Then Fra Mino saw them spring up and gather great handfuls of roses
and advance upon him in a long line each armed with roses and thorns
But the distance that separated them from him which at first had seemed
very short for indeed he thought almost to touch them and felt their
breath on his face appeared suddenly to increase and he watched them
coming as though from out a faroff forest Impatient to be at him they
began to run threatening him with their cruel flowers while menaces
flew from their flowerlike lips And lo as they came nearer a change
was wrought in them at each step they lost something of their grace and
beauty and the bloom of their youth faded as fast as the roses in their
hands First their eyes grew hollow and the mouth fell in The neck but
now so pure and white hung in great hideous folds and grey elflocks
draggled over their wrinkled brows On they came and their eyes were
circled with red their lips drawn in upon the toothless gums On they
came carrying dead roses in their arms which were black and writhen
as the old vine stocks the peasants of Chianti burn for firewood in the
winter nights On they came with shaking heads and palsied thighs
tottering and trembling
Arrived at the spot where Fra Mino stood rooted to the ground with
affright they were no better than a crowd of horrid witches bald and
bearded nose and chin touching and bosoms hanging loose and flabby
They came crowding round him
Ah ha the pretty darling cried one He is as white as a sheet and
his heart beats like a hare the dogs are snapping at gle sister mine
say what must be done with him
Nera mine gle replied why we must open his breast tear out his
heart and put a sponge in its place instead
Not so said Meliboea That were making him pay too dear for his
curiosity and the pleasure he has had in surprising our frolic Enough
for this time to inflict a light chastisement Say shall we give him a
good whipping
Straightway surrounding the Monk the sisters dragged his gown above his
head and belaboured him with the handfuls of thorns they still held
The blood was beginning to come when Nera signed to them to stop
Enough she cried he is my gallant I tell you I saw him just now
casting tender eyes at me I would content his wishes and grant him my
favours without more delay
She smiled alluringly and a long black tooth projecting from her mouth
tickled his nostril She murmured softly
Come come my Adonis
Then suddenly wild with rage
Fie fie his senses are benumbed His coldness offends my charms He
scorns me avenge me comrades Mnais gle Meliboea avenge your
sister
At this appeal one and all lifting their thorny whips fell to
scourging him so savagely that Fra Minos body was soon one wound from
head to toe Now and again they would stop to cough and spit only to
begin afresh plying their whips more vigorously than ever Only sheer
weariness induced them to leave off
I hope Nera then said next time he will not do me the undeserved
insult I still blush to remember We will spare his life but if he
betrays the secret of our sports and pleasures we will surely kill him
Goodbye to you my pretty boy
So saying the old woman suddenly squatted down over the Monk and
drowned him in a torrent of very filthy liquid Each sister followed
suit and did the like then one after the other they reentered the tomb
of San Satiro slipping in through a tiny crack in the lid leaving
their victim lying full length in a stream of a most intolerable stench
When the last had disappearedthe cock crew Then Fra Mino at last
found himself able to rise from the earth Broken with fatigue and pain
benumbed with cold shuddering with fever half stifled with the foul
exhalations of the poisonous liquor he set his clothing straight and
dragged himself to his cell just as day broke
From that night on Fra Mino never had a moments peace The
recollection of what he had seen in the Chapel of San Michele above San
Satiros tomb disturbed him in the Church services and in all his pious
exercises He trembled when he visited the Church along with his
fellows and as his turn came according to the rule to kiss the
pavement of the Choir his lips shuddered to encounter the traces of the
nymphs presence and he would murmur O my Saviour dost not Thou
hear me say what Thou didst Thyself say to Thy Father Lead us not we
beseech Thee into temptation At first he had thought of sending to
the Lord Bishop an account of what he had witnessed But on riper
reflexion he became convinced it were better to meditate at leisure on
these extraordinary events and only divulge them after a more exhaustive
study of all the circumstances Besides it so happened that the Lord
Bishop allied with the Guelphs of Pisa against the Ghibellines of
Florence was at that moment waging war with such right good will that
for a whole month he had not so much as unbuckled his cuirass And that
is why without saying a word to anyone Fra Mino made profound
researches on the tomb of San Satiro and the Chapel containing it
Deeply versed in the knowledge of books he investigated many texts
both ancient and modern yet found no glimmer of enlightenment in any of
them Indeed the only effect of the works on Magic which he studied was
to double his uncertainty
One morning after labouring all the night as was his wont he was fain
to refresh his heart with a walk in the fields He took the hilly path
which winding between the vines and the elms they are wedded to leads
to a wood of myrtles and olives sacred in old days to the Roman gods
His feet bathed in the wet grass his brow refreshed by the dew that
distilled from the pointed leaves of the Guelder roses Fra Mino
wandered long in the forest till he came upon a spring over which the
wild tamarisks gently swayed their light foliage and the downy clusters
of their pink berries Lower down amid the willows where the water
formed a wider pool herons stood motionless while the smaller birds
sang sweetly in the branching myrtles The scent of mint rose moist and
fragrant from the ground and the grass was spangled with the flowers of
which our Lord said that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like
one of these Fra Mino sat down on a mossy stone and praising God Who
made the heavens and the dew he fell to pondering the hidden mysteries
of Nature
Now the remembrance of all he had seen in the Chapel of San Michele
never left his thoughts so he sat meditating his head between his
hands wondering for the thousandth time what the dream might signify
For indeed he said to himself such a vision must needs have a
meaning it should even have several which it behoves to discover
whether by sudden illumination or by dint of an exact applying of the
scholastic rules And I deem that in this especial case the poets I
studied at Bologna such as Horace the Satirist and Statius should
likewise be of great help to me seeing many verities are intermingled
with their fables
After long pondering these thoughts within his breast and others more
subtle still he lifted his eyes and perceived he was not alone Leaning
against the cavernous trunk of an ancient holmoak an old man stood
gazing at the sky through the leaves and smiling to himself Above his
hoary brow peeped out two shorty blunt horns His nose was flat with
wide nostrils and from his chin depended a white beard through which
were visible the rugged muscles of the neck A shaggy growth of hair
covered his breast while from the thighs downwards his limbs showed a
thick fleece that trailed down to his cloven feet He held to his lips a
flute of reed from which he drew a feeble sound of music Then he began
to sing in a voice that left the words barely distinguishable
Laughing she fled
Her teeth in the golden grape
After I sped
And clasping her flying shape
I quenched my drouth
On the fruit at her mouth
Astounded at these strange sights and sounds Fra Mino crossed himself
Still the old man showed no mark of confusion but cast a long and
artless look at the Monk Amid the deep wrinkles that scored his face
the clear blue eyes sparkled like the waters of a spring through the
rugged bark of a grove of oaks
Man or beast shrilled Mino I command you in the name of the Saviour
to say who you are
My son replied the old man I am San Satiro Speak not so loud for
fear of frightening the birds
Then Fra Mino resumed in a quieter tone
Forasmuch old man as you shrank not before the dread sign of the
Cross I cannot hold you to be a demon or some foul spirit escaped out
of Hell But if verily and indeed you are a man as you say you are or
rather the soul of a man sanctified by the deeds of a good life and by
the merits of our Lord Jesus Christ expound I pray you the mystery of
your goats horns and your shaggy limbs ending in those black cloven
hoofs
At the question the old man lifted up his arms towards heaven and
said
My son the nature of men and animals of plants and stones is the
secret of the immortal gods and I know as little as yourself what is
the reason of these horns wherewith my brow is decked and which the
Nymphs used in olden days to wind about with garlands of flowers I
cannot tell you the meaning of the two wrinkled folds that droop from my
neck nor why I have the feet of a wanton goat But I would have you
know my son there was once in these woods a race of women having
horned brows like mine and shaggy thighs Yet were their bosoms round
and white and their belly and polished loins shone in the light The
sun was young then and loved to fleck them with his golden arrows as
they lay beneath the shady foliage They were very fair my son but
alas they have vanished from the woods every one My mates have
perished likewise and I am left lonely the last of my tribe
I would fain know your age old man and your lineage and country
My son I was born of the Earth long ere Jupiter had dethroned Saturn
and my eyes have looked upon the flowery freshness of the newcreated
World Not yet had the human race emerged from the clay Alone with me
the dancing Satyr girls set the ground ringing with the rhythmic beat of
their double hoofs They were taller and stronger and fairer than either
Nymphs or Women and their ampler loins received abundantly the seed of
the firstborn of Earth
Under the reign of Jupiter the Nymphs began to inhabit fountains and
forests and mountains while the Fauns accoupling with the Nymphs
formed lightfooted bands that roamed the woods together Meantime I
spent a happy life tasting at will the clusters of the wild grapes and
the lips of the laughing Faungirls I enjoyed deep and restful slumbers
amid the lush grass and I would celebrate on my rustic flute Jupiter
Saturns successor for it is of my nature to praise the gods masters
of the world
Alas and I am grown old for I am but a god and the centuries have
