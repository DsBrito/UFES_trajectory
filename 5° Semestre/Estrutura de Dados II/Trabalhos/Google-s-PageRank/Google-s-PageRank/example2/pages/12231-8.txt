THE BEETLE OF BUDAPESTH
AN UNRECORDED EPISODE OF THE GREAT WAR
The War being now practically at an end and AustriaHungary
irrevocably broken up I am able to recount an adventure in which
I was involved that occurred at BudaPesth in the second week of
August 1914
Seated at a cafe on the famous FranzJosef Quai I was sipping coffee
after an excellent lunch with Frederick whose surname I will not
mention in case I get into trouble for relating the incident before
Peace is actually signed The sun shone joyously down upon the
kaleidoscope of gaily dressed people promenading by the cool waters
of the Danube and we sat engrossedI in the charm of the scene and
Frederick in that of individual beauties who passed to and fro
Suddenly I noticed that he was staring intently upon the ground a few
yards in front of him I asked him what was the matter
Perceive he replied in a very serious tone a small beetle of the
order of Coleoptera making its way across the pavement
I do perceive it I replied but what about it
Does it not occur to you he continued that it is a very
remarkable thing that that beetle should have already travelled six
feet across the most crowded promenade in BudaPesth without having
been trodden on
Being used to Frederick I do not take him too seriously and made no
reply intending to brush the incident aside but I found my gaze
continually returning to Coleopteron conscious of that peculiar
fascination which attracts one to impending tragedy It was evident
that he had just left the cafe and was hurrying across the promenade
to catch the little steamer which was due to leave in ten minutes for
Ofen It was also evident to any thinking individual that there must
be some extraordinarily urgent reason for his wishing to catch the
boat which justified him in taking the awful risks which he was
incurring The position was full of human interest and I became as
intrigued as Frederick
It seemed that Coleopteron was under some divine protection which
enabled him to elude so large a crowd One lady stepped right on him
but apparently by a piece of brilliant footwork he managed to get
in the arch between the sole and the heel and so survive Another
promenader brushed him with his boot and knocked him over but he
doggedly continued on his way
I was conscious of a greatly accelerated beating of my heart and
noticed that Frederick was perspiring freely
Halfway across the twentyfoot pavement Coleopteron was sniffed at
by a dog and our hearts stopped beating but again he was saved by
the fact that the dog was on a chain and just hadnt time to eat him
before he was dragged after his mistress
I noticed now that Fredericks eyes were protruding from his head and
that he was muttering to himself I too felt the strain telling upon
me A shrill whistle from the little steamer warning passengers to
hurry up was immediately responded to by Coleopteron who increased
his speed to the utmost when suddenly Fredericks trembling hand
caught mine
Look he said and following his gaze I saw approaching twelve
gendarmes We did not speak we did not need to invite each others
views our minds had but a single thoughtColeopteron could not
possibly escape twentyfour Hungarian Government boots
On scurried our little friend and on came the gendarmes I was
conscious of a feeling of physical sickness and Frederick groaned
aloud As the dreadful moment of contact approached we shut our eyes
tight and each gripped the others hand How long we remained like
this I cannot tell for we were both afraid to look and see the my
smudge on the pavement indicating a heros end but eventually by
mutual arrangement we opened our eyes and then we sawnot a smudge
but Coleopteron still advancing quite unconcerned It was a miracle
I cant stand it any longer cried Frederick to the amazement
of those sitting about us outside the cafe I shall go mad and
leaping up from his seat he rushed across the promenade and taking
from his pocket a picturepostcard of some Hungarian beauty he coaxed
Coleopteron to walk on to it then bore him triumphantly back and
deposited him upon the leaf of a palm which overhung our table
Shortly afterwards the little steamer whistled again and left the
quay
Frederick remained silent for some time as befits a man who has saved
a life and then arose to have a look at Coleopteron and doubtless
to make himself better known to the little hero but to his pained
surprise Coleopteron was not to be found All over that palm he
searched in vain and on the floor then suddenly he emitted a gurgling
sound and I saw that he was in the grip of deep emotion There was a
look on his face I had never seen before and I anxiously asked him
what had happened For some time he could not speak but stood gazing
vacantly into space At last with parched lips he spoke
Look in the milkjug he said and sank into his chair
For a moment I thought that Frederick had been poisoned and then I
realised the truth for there in the hot milk floated the corpse of
Coleopteron
Why did he do it pleaded Frederick with a break in his voice
Because I replied you hadnt the sense to realise that he was
staking his all on catching that boat and instead of helping him
you brought him back to where he started from
Early the next morning at Fredericks desire we left BudaPesth en
route for the Swiss Frontier It was impossible if he was to retain
his reason to stay longer in a city that had for him such tragic
associations

A CAPITAL OUTLAY
It was in a sense mutual We had chickens the chickens had us On
the other hand they had the best of the bargain We kept them and
they did not keep us
My aunt insisted that we must keep chickens and you know my aunt
Pardon You dont know my aunt She is an elderly maiden lady who
keeps house for me She is eminently practicaltheoretically
speaking
She insisted With eggs at eightpence its a sin and a shame not to
keep hens in wartime
I urged that the food would cost a good many eightpencesin wartime
Her reply was Pshaw She really does say Pshawand means it
Pshaw they will live on kitchen scraps
We consulted Nibletts He has a local reputation as a chicken expert
mainly I believe because hes a butcher He recommended a breed
called Wild Oats by which he meant I discovered Wyandottes
You take my tip Sir he said and buy Wild Oats If youll excuse
the word Nibletts is always apologising for some term he is about
to use which promises to be inexpressibly shocking to polite ears
and never istheyre clinkers
We ordered a round dozen We also bought a henhouse fitted with all
modern conveniences The total outlay represented a princes ransom
but as I pointed out to my aunt we had a run for our money
The hens when they arrived were not strictly as per advertisement
We bought them as laying pullets and they didnt lay for quite a
timeso far as we knew Nibletts however declared that they were
what you might call in the pink and surmised that the train journey
had put em off the lay as you might say If eating and fighting
were evidences of their being in the pink those birds must have
enjoyed exceptional health They also slept well I believe
After about a month one enormous egg arrivedan egg that would not
have disgraced a young ostrich Its huge dimensions worried my aunt
She wondered if they were a symptom and consulted Nibletts
He put it down to the food He said that kitchen scraps were no good
for laying pullets That egg lady he said is what us fanciers
callexcuse me I saw my aunt shudder in anticipationa
bloomer You must give em a lot more meal
We bought a big sack of mealthrough the medium of Nibletts If I
remember rightly it cost rather more than the pullets
Still no eggs Then some of the hens went out of the pink For
instance one developed a chronic habit of running centripetally
round a constantly diminishing circle fainting on arriving at
the geometrical centre My distressed aunt called in Nibletts to
prescribe There was only one word for itthat awful word staggers
There was only one cure for itdeath Should he wring its neck
We feelingly withdrew and he did it He took the corpse away with
him so that he presumably had a use for it
Soon a second pullet went down with a considerably swollen face My
aunt bathed it twice a day in a hot antiseptic but to no purpose
except that the poor thing seemed much comforted by the fomentation
That hen was Nibletts whispered to me for fear my aunt should
overhear a waster The only thing to do was to coop it up from the
rest or theyd all go down with itwhatever it was
We cooped it up till it died Nibletts certified the cause of death as
that unmentionable complaint the pip
Still no eggs notwithstanding repeated appeals in the sacred name of
Macduff We did however find out what the trouble was
The hens were eating the eggs
Nibletts saidunder his breaththat they were what was known as
blighters He recommended deprecating the term a stodger A
stodger proved to be an eggshell stuffed with breadcrumbs mustard
and the strongest photographic ammonia
My aunt said it would be cruel It was certainly rough on me Nibletts
apologetically directed me to blow an egga shop un d do
Accordingly following his instructions I injected or otherwise
introduced the ingredients through a small aperture It was the
breadcrumbs that gave me most trouble but it was the photographic
ammonia that was cruel The mustard went in quite easily with a
squirt
I stopped the holes with paper stuck on with sealingwax and put
the oeuf farci in the run I waited to see what would happen It
happened at once All ten hens went for that egg in a convergent
attack and all ten pecks got home simultaneously The deputation then
hurriedly withdrew with loud protests and spent the rest of the day
wiping their beaks in the cool earth
But they remained recalcitrant They systematically cannibalized A
cackle from the layer brought all the rest to the spot and I simply
couldnt stay there all day to forestall the onslaught
Nibletts suggested our getting a patent layingbox furnished with
what he apologised to my aunt for calling a false front My aunt did
not at first grasp the idea but what Nibletts did in fact refer
to was a contrivance that would admit one sitter only at a time
subsequent unauthorised entrance being cut off by an ingenious drop
slide Further elaborate construction also prevented the sitter
herself from turning round to peck She had to remain sitting till
some human came and lifted her out
Just one egg was laid in that patent box The object of it was also
patentto the hens Nothing would induce them to use it after that
once
Nibletts then recommended if he might so describe it a titup
That was so to speak a conjuringtrick of a layingbox which let
the egg fall through a trapdoor into a padded cell beneath My
aunt thought it unnatural and feared that it might be exhausting
Nevertheless we tried it and extracted one solitary egg from the
basement
Then being an engineer by profession I conceived a mechanical means
of giving those hens the scare of their lives if they persisted
in their antisocial habits I constructed a spoof egg of white
enamelled metal with hinges that opened when a catch was touched
Inside I compressed one of those jackinthebox snakes that spring
out when free to do so
It was quite effectiveas a parlourtrick Those hens pecked the
catch loose and that cockatrice fairly staggered them It was to them
a clear case of nourishing a viper But all was as before
Nibletts then gave up the case as what he might be excused for
calling a fair corker Should he wring their pause necks
We thought it best so and gave him a couple of laying pullets for
his trouble The other eight kept us going monotonously for about a
month
The house is still on offer Houses are scarce just now
I have sown my Wyandottes
It was the incometax man that suggested the title that I have given
to my story I disagreed with him in toto But he persisted that it
wasnt an expense

PROCRASTINATION
A few mornings ago I found among my letters a tragic documenta
bill A first quick glance at it filled me with despair because I was
luxuriating in that Fools Paradise produced by the illusion that one
is all paid up Of course one never is there is always something that
one forgets and this must have been it so that instead of perfect
freedom from liability here I was apparently still owing no less a
sum than 5 9s
The figures looked familiar enough although disconcerting but I
rubbed my eyes when I found that they were made up of two items that
had never come my way the first being oneandahalf dozen essences
3 15s and the second a dozen poudre assortie 1 14s It
could not be for me Essences and powders wholesale are not in my
line nor is my acquaintance so extensive among the Fair as these
quantities would imply
A moment later all my anxieties dispersed and tragedy turned to comedy
when I realised that the bill was for the hairdresser with the same
name as my own who lives next door but one and gets so much of my
correspondence
I therefore put the bill on my desk intending to take it into the
shop when I went out and forgot it
The Russian Corps de Ballet at the Alhambra is an assemblage of
charming and gifted people who are at last giving their admirers full
measure Now that they have a vast theatre of their own and perform
three ballets every night the old frustrated feeling that used to
tantalise us at the Opera and the Coliseum has vanished But I have
still a grievance and that is that the programme is so rarely the
programme that I myself would have arranged In other words the three
ballets that form it are seldom the Big Three that are nearest my
heart To be explicit I want Petroushka and instead I find myself
not knowing where to look while Scheherazade unfolds its appalling
freedoms I want Les Sylphides and instead am given Les
Papillons which is very lovely but not of an equal loveliness and I
want Carnaval and instead am offered the perplexities of The
Fire Bird It happened however that one night recently the perfect
programme was givenCarnaval Les Sylphides and Petroushka but
there was not a seat in the house and I therefore had to stand in
great discomfort so that half the joy evaporated
Meanwhile I seem to hear you say what of the hairdresser who has
the same name as yourself and plies his trade next door but one This
storywhich so far is a poor enough thingwas surely to have been
about him So I seem to hear you say
Patience It is about him but it is also about the evils of
procrastination In short it is a kind of tract
On the morning after my disappointing evening at the Alhambra while
moving some papers on my desk I brought to light the bill for the
powder and the essences Good Heavens I murmured the poor
fellow will be distracted not to have this and I took it in to him
straightway
I apologised for the delay
There is no hurry he replied Accounts can wait But I hope he
added taking an envelope from a drawer that this letter for you
is equally unimportant It came Im afraid four days ago and I was
always meaning to bring it in but forgot
Unimportant It was merely an invitation from the most adorable woman
in London to share her box at the Russian Ballet on the previous
night to see what she knew was my most desired performance
Carnaval Les Sylphides and Pelroushka
Either the hairdresser or I must move
Or we must both take a course of memory training I believe there is
some system on the market

THE PERILS OF REVIEWING
A most unfortunate thing has happened to a friend of mine called
to a friend of  to a friend of  Well I suppose the truth
will have to come out It happened to me Only dont tell anybody
I reviewed a book the other day It is not often I do this because
before one can review a book one has to or is supposed to read
it which wastes a good deal of time Even that isnt an end of the
trouble The article which follows is not really ones own for the
wretched fellow who wrote the book is always trying to push his way
in with his views on matrimony or the Sussex downs or whatever his
ridiculous subject is He expects one to say Mr Blanks treatment
of Hildas relations with her husband is masterly whereas what one
wants to say is Putting Mr Blanks book on one side we may consider
the larger question whether  and so consider it alone to the
end of the column
Well I reviewed Mr Blanks book Rotundity As I expected the
first draft had to be reheaded A Corner of Old London and used
elsewhere Mr Blank didnt get into it at all I kept promising
myself a sentence Take Rotundity for instance the new novel by
William Blank which etc but before I was ready for it the article
was finished In my second draft realizing the dangers of delay I
began at once This remarkable novel and continued so for a couple
of sentences But on reading it through afterwards I saw at once that
the first two sentences were out of place in an article that obviously
ought to be called The Last Swallow so I cut them out sent The
Last Swallow A Reverie to another Editor and began again The third
time I was successful
Of course in my review I said all the usual things I said that Mr
Blanks attitude to life was subjective rather than objective
and a little lower down that it was objective rather than
subjective I pointed out that in his treatment of the major theme he
was a neoromanticist but I suggested that on the other hand he
had nothing to learn from the Russiansor the Russians had nothing
to learn from him I forget which And finally I said and this is
the cause of the whole trouble that ANTOINE VAURELLES worldfamous
classicand I looked it up in the Encyclopaediaworldrenowned
classic Je Comprends Tout had been not without its influence on
Mr Blank It was a good review and the editor was pleased about it
A few days later Mr Blank wrote to say that curiously enough he
had never read Je Comprends Tout It didnt seem to me very curious
because I had never read it either but I thought it rather odd of him
to confess as much to a stranger The only book of VAURELLES which I
had read was Consolatrice in an English translation However one
doesnt say these things in a review
Now I have a French friend Henri one of those annoying Frenchmen who
