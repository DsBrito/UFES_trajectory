government has ever existed than that of Burma when with the boast
that she intended to drive the British out of India she began the
war No people were ever kept down by a more grinding tyranny and
the occupation of the country by the British has been an even
greater blessing to the population than has that of India
Several works some by eyewitnesses others compiled from official
documents appeared after the war They differ remarkably in the
relation of details and still more in the spelling of the names
both of persons and places I have chiefly followed those given in
the narratives of Mr H H Wilson and of Major Snodgrass the
military secretary to the commander of the expedition
Chapter 1 A New Career
A party was assembled in a room of an hotel in Calcutta at the end
of the year 1822 It consisted of a gentleman a lady in deep
mourning a boy of between fourteen and fifteen and two girls of
thirteen and twelve
I think you had better accept my offer Nellie the gentleman was
saying You will find it hard work enough to make both ends meet
with these two girls and Stanley would be a heavy drain on you
The girls cost nothing but their clothes but he must go to a
decent school and then there would be the trouble of thinking what
to do with him afterwards If I could have allowed you a couple of
hundred a year it would have been altogether different but you
see I am fighting an uphill fight myself and need every penny
that I can scrape together I am getting on and I can see well
enough that unless something occurs to upset the whole thing I
shall be doing a big trade one of these days but every half penny
of profit has to go into the business So as you know I cannot
help you at present though by the time the girls grow up I hope I
shall be able to do so and that to a good extent
I feel sure that it would not be a bad thing for Stanley He will
soon get to be useful to me and in three or four years will be a
valuable assistant Speaking Hindustani as well as he does he
wont be very long in picking up enough of the various dialects in
Kathee and Chittagong for our purpose and by twenty he will have
a share of the business and be on the highway towards making his
fortune It will be infinitely better than anything he is likely to
find in England and he will be doing a mans work at the age when
he would still be a schoolboy in England
I have spoken to him about it Of course he does not like leaving
you but he says that he should like it a thousand times better
than perhaps having to go into some humdrum office in England
Thank you Tom Mrs Brooke said with a sigh It will be very
hard to part with himterribly hardbut I see that it is by far
the best thing for him and as you say in a monetary way it will
be a relief to me I think I can manage very comfortably on the
pension in some quiet place at home with the two girls but
Stanleys schooling would be a heavy drain I might even manage
that for I might earn a little money by painting but there would
be the question of what to do with him when he left school and
without friends or influence it will be hopeless to get him into
any good situation
You see Herberts parents have both died since he came out here
and though he was distantly related to the Earl of Netherly he
was only a second cousin or something of that kind and knew
nothing about the family and of course I could not apply to them
Certainly not Nellie her brother agreed There is nothing so
hateful as posing as a poor relationand that is a connection
rather than a relationship Then you will leave the boy in my
hands
I am sure that it will be best she said with a tremor in her
voice and at any rate I shall have the comfort of knowing that
he will be well looked after
Mrs Brooke was the widow of a captain in one of the native
regiments of the East India Company He had six weeks before this
been carried off suddenly by an outbreak of cholera and she had
been waiting at Calcutta in order to see her brother before
sailing for England She was the daughter of an English clergyman
who had died some seventeen years before Nellie who was then
eighteen being motherless as well as fatherless had determined to
sail for India A great friend of hers had married and gone out a
year before Nellies father was at that time in bad health and
her friend had said to her at parting
Now mind Nellie I have your promise that if you should find
yourself alone here you will come out to me in India I shall be
very glad to have you with me and I dont suppose you will be on
my hands very long pretty girls dont remain single many months
in India
So seeing nothing better to do Nellie had shortly after her
fathers death sailed for Calcutta
Lieutenant Brooke was also a passenger on board the Ava and during
the long voyage he and Nellie Pearson became engaged and were
married from her friends house a fortnight after their arrival
Nellie was told that she was a foolish girl for that she ought to
have done better but she was perfectly happy The pay and
allowances of her husband were sufficient for them to live upon in
comfort and though when the children came there was little to
spare the addition of pay when he gained the rank of captain was
ample for their wants They had been in fact a perfectly happy
coupleboth had bright and sunny dispositions and made the best
of everything and she had never had a serious care until he was
suddenly taken away from her
Stanley had inherited his parents disposition and as his sisters
coming so soon after him occupied the greater portion of his
mothers care he was left a good deal to his own devices and
became a general pet in the regiment and was equally at home in
the mens lines and in the officers bungalows The native language
came as readily to him as English and by the time he was ten he
could talk in their own tongue with the men from the three or four
different districts from which the regiment had been recruited His
father devoted a couple of hours a day to his studies He did not
attempt to teach him Latinwhich would he thought be altogether
useless to himbut gave him a thorough grounding in English and
Indian history and arithmetic and insisted upon his spending a
certain time each day in reading standard English authors
Tom Pearson who was five years younger than his sister had come
out to India four years after her He was a lad full of life and
energy As soon as he left school finding himself the master of a
hundred poundsthe last remains of the small sum that his father
had left behind himhe took a secondclass passage to Calcutta As
soon as he had landed he went round to the various merchants and
offices and finding that he could not owing to a want of
references obtain a clerkship he took a place in the store of a
Parsee merchant who dealt in English goods Here he remained for
five years by which time he had mastered two or three native
languages and had obtained a good knowledge of business
He now determined to start on his own account He had lived hardly
saving up every rupee not needed for actual necessaries and at the
end of the five years he had in all a hundred and fifty pounds
He had long before this determined that the best opening for
trade was among the tribes on the eastern borders of the British
territory and had specially devoted himself to the study of the
languages of Kathee and Chittagong
Investing the greater portion of his money in goods suitable for the
trade he embarked at Calcutta in a vessel bound for Chittagong
There he took passage in a native craft going up the great river to
Sylhet where he established his headquarters and thenceleaving
the greater portion of his goods in the care of a native merchant
with whom his late employer had had dealingsstarted with a native
and four donkeys on which his goods were packed to trade among the
wild tribes
His success fully equalled his anticipations and gradually he
extended his operations going as far east as Manipur and south
almost as far as Chittagong The firm in Calcutta from whom he had
in the first place purchased his goods sent him up fresh stores
as he required them and soon seeing the energy with which he was
pushing his business gave him considerable credit and he was able
to carry on his operations on an increasingly larger scale Sylhet
remained his headquarters but he had a branch at Chittagong
whither goods could be sent direct from Calcutta and from this he
drew his supplies for his trade in that province
Much of his business was carried on by means of the waterways and
the very numerous streams that covered the whole country and
enabled him to carry his goods at a far cheaper rate than he could
transport them by land and for this purpose he had a boat
specially fitted up with a comfortable cabin He determined from
the first to sell none but the best goods in the market and thus
he speedily gained the confidence of the natives and the arrival
of his boats was eagerly hailed by the villagers on the banks of
the rivers
He soon found that money was scarce and that to do a good
business he must take native products in barter for his goods and
that in this way he not only did a much larger trade but obtained
a very much better price for his wares than if he had sold only for
money and he soon consigned considerable quantities to the firm in
Calcutta and by so doing obtained a profit both ways He himself
paid a visit to Calcutta every six months or so to choose fresh
fashions of goods and to visit the firm with whom his dealings
every year became more extensive But though laying the
foundations for an extensive business he was not as he told his
sister at present in a position to help her for his increasing
trade continually demanded more and more capital and the whole of
his profits were swallowed up by the larger stocks that had to be
held at his depots at Sylhet Chittagong and at the mouths of the
larger rivers
Twice since he had been out he had met his sister at Calcutta and
when she came down after her husbands death and heard from Toms
agents that he would probably arrive there in the course of a
fortnight she decided to wait there and meet him He was greatly
grieved at her loss and especially so as he was unable to offer
her a home for as his whole time was spent in travelling it was
impossible for him to do so nor indeed would she have accepted
it Now that her husband was gone she yearned to be back in
England again It was too far better for the girls that she
should take them home But when he now offered to take the boy she
felt that hard as it would be to leave Stanley behind the offer
was a most advantageous one for him
The boys knowledge of Indian languages which would be of immense
advantage to him in such a life would be absolutely useless in
England and from what Tom told her of his business there could be
little doubt that the prospects were excellent Stanley himself
who now saw his uncle for the first time was attracted to him by
the energy and cheeriness of manner that had rendered him so
successful in business and he was stirred by the enterprise and
adventure of the life he proposed for him More than once in the
littlefrequented rivers that stretched into Kathee his boats had
been attacked by wild tribesmen and he had to fight hard to keep
them off Petty chiefs had at times endeavoured to obstruct his
trading and when at Manipur he had twice been witness of
desperate fights between rival claimants for the throne All this
was to a boy brought up among soldiers irresistibly fascinating
especially as the alternative seemed to be a seat in a dull
counting house in England
He was then delighted when his mother gave her consent to his
remaining with his uncle grieved as he was at being parted from
her and his sisters The thought that he should in time be able
to be of assistance to her was a pleasant one and aided him to
support the pain of parting when a week later she sailed with the
girls for England
I suppose you have not done any shooting Stanley his uncle
asked
Not with a gun but I have practised sometimes with pistols
Father thought that it would be useful
Very useful and you must learn to shoot well with them and with
fowlingpiece and rifle What with river thieves and dacoits and
wild tribesto say nothing of wild beastsa man who travels
about as I do wants to be able to shoot straight The straighter
you shoot the less likely you are to have to do so I have come to
be a good shot myself and whenever we row up a river I constantly
practiseeither at floating objects in the water or at birds or
other marks in the trees I have the best weapons that money can
buy It is my one extravagance and the result is that to my
boatmen and the men about me my shooting seems to be marvellous
they tell others of it and the result is that I am regarded with
great respect I have no doubt whatever that it has saved me from
much trouble for the natives have almost got to believe that I
only have to point my gun and the man I wish to kill falls dead
however far distant
Two days after the departure of Mrs Brooke her brother and
Stanley started down the Hoogly in a native trader
She is a curiouslooking craft uncle
Yes she would not be called handsome in home waters but she is
uncommonly fast and I find her much more convenient in many ways
than a British merchantman
Is she yours uncle
No she is not mine and I do not exactly charter her but she
works principally for me You see the wages are so low that they
can work a craft like this for next to nothing Why the captain
and his eight men together dont get higher pay than the
boatswain of an English trader
The captain owns the vessel He is quite content if he gets a few
rupees a month in addition to what he considers his own rate of
pay His wife and his two children live on board If the craft can
earn twenty rupees a week he considers that he is doing
splendidly At the outside he would not pay his men more than four
rupees a month each and I suppose that he would put down his
services at eight so that would leave him forty rupees a month as
the profit earned by the ship
In point of fact I keep him going pretty steadily He makes trips
backwards and forwards between the different depots carries me up
the rivers for a considerable distance does a little trade on his
own accountnot in goods such as I sell you know but purely
native storestakes a little freight when he can get it and
generally a few native passengers I pay him fifteen rupees a week
and I suppose he earns from five to ten in addition so that the
arrangement suits us both admirably
I keep the stern cabin for myself As you see she has four little
brass guns which I picked up for a song at Calcutta and there are
twentyfour muskets aft It is an arrangement that the crew are to
practise shooting once a week so they have all come to be pretty
fair shots and the captain himself can send a twopound shot
from those little guns uncommonly straight
You will be amused when you see us practising for action The
captains wife and the two boys load the guns and do it very
quickly too He runs round from gun to gun takes aim and fires
The crew shout and yell and bang away with their muskets I take
the command and give a few pice among them if the firing has been
accurate
We have been attacked once or twice in the upper waters but
have always managed to beat the robbers off without much
difficulty The captain fires away till they get pretty close and
I pepper them with my riflesI have three of them When they get
within fifty yards the crew open fire and as they have three
muskets each they can make it very hot for the pirates I have a
store of hand grenades and if they push on I throw two or three
on board when they get within ten yards and that has always
finished the matter They dont understand the things bursting in
the middle of them I dont mean to say that my armament would be
of much use if we were trading along the coast of the Malay
Peninsula or among the Islands but it is quite enough to deal with
the petty robbers of these rivers
But I thought that you had a boat that you went up the rivers in
uncle
Yes we tow a rowboat and a store boat up behind this craft as
far as she can go that is as long as she has wind enough to make
against the sluggish stream When she can go no further I take to
the rowboat It has eight rowers carries a gunit is a
twelvepounder howitzerthat I have had cut short so that it is
only about a foot long Of course it wont carry far but that is
not necessary Its charge is a pound of powder and a tenpound bag
of bullets and at a couple of hundred yards the balls scatter
enough to sweep two or three canoes coming abreast and as we can
charge and fire the little thing three times in a minute it is all
that we require for practical purposes
It is only on a few of the rivers we go up that there is any fear
of trouble On the river from Sylhet to the east and its branches
in Kathee or as it is sometimes called Kasi the country is
comparatively settled The Goomtee beyond Oudypore is well enough
until it gets into Kaayn which is what they call independent That
is to say it owns no authority and some villages are peaceable
and well disposed while others are savage The same may be said of
the Munnoo and Fenny rivers
For the last two years I have done a good deal of trade in Assam
up the Brahmaputra river As far as Rungpoor there are a great many
villages on the banks and the people are quiet and peaceable
Then you dont go further south than Chittagong uncle
No The Burmese hold Aracan on the south and indeed for some
distance north of it there is no very clearlydefined border You
see the great river runs from Rangoon very nearly due north
though with a little east in it and extends along at the back of
the districts I trade with so that the Burmese are not very far
from Manipur which indeed stands on a branch of the Irrawaddy of
which another branch runs nearly up to Rungpoor
We shall have big trouble with them one of these days indeed we
have had troubles already You see the Burmese are a great and
increasing power and have so easily conquered all their neighbours
that they regard themselves as invincible Until the beginning of
the eighteenth century the Burmese were masters of Pegu then the
people of that country with the help of the Dutch and Portuguese
threw off their yoke But the Burmese were not long kept down for
in 1753 Alompraa huntergathered a force round him and after
keeping up an irregular warfare for some time was joined by so
many of his countrymen that he attacked and captured Ava conquered
the whole of Pegu and in 1759 the English trading colony at
Negrais were massacred
This however was not the act of Alompra but of the treachery of
a Frenchman named Levine and of an Armenian who incited the
Burmese of the district to exterminate the Englishhoping no
doubt thus to retrieve in a new quarter the fortunes of France
which in India were being extinguished by the genius of Clive The
English were at the time far too occupied with the desperate
struggle they were having in India to attempt to revenge the
massacre of their countrymen at Negrais
Very rapidly the Burman power spread They captured the valuable
Tenasserim coast from Siam repulsed a formidable invasion from
China annexed Aracan and dominated Manipur and thus became
masters of the whole tract of country lying between China and
Hindustan As they now bordered upon our territory a mission was
sent in 1794 to them from India with a proposal for the settlement
of boundaries and for the arrangement of trade between the two
countries Nothing came of it for the Burmese had already
proposed to themselves the conquest of India and considered the
mission as a proof of the terror that their advance had inspired
among us
After the conquest by them of Aracan in 1784 there had been a
constant irritation felt against us by the Burmese owing to the
fact that a great number of fugitives from that country had taken
refuge in the swamps and islands of Chittagong from which they
from time to time issued and made raids against the Burmese In
1811 these fugitives in alliance with some predatory chiefs
invaded Aracan in force and being joined by the subject population
there expelled the Burmese These however soon reconquered the
province The affair was nevertheless unfortunate since the
Burmese naturally considered that as the insurrection had begun
with an invasion by the fugitives in Chittagong it had been
fomented by us
This was in no way the fact We had no force there capable of
keeping the masses of fugitives in order but we did our best and
arrested many of the leaders when they returned after their
defeat This however was far from satisfying the Burmese A
mission was sent to Ava to assure them of our friendly
intentions and that we had had nothing whatever to do with the
invasion and would do all we could to prevent its recurrence The
Burmese government declined to receive the mission
We ourselves had much trouble with the insurgents for fearful
of reentering Burma after their defeat they now carried on a
series of raids in our territory and it was not until 1816 that
these were finally suppressed Nevertheless the court of Ava
remained dissatisfied and a fresh demand was raised for the
surrender of the chiefs who had been captured and of the whole of
the fugitives living in the government of Chittagong The Marquis
of Hastings replied that the British government could not without
a violation of the principles of justice deliver up those who had
sought its protection that tranquillity now existed and there was
no probability of a renewal of the disturbances but that the
greatest vigilance should be used to prevent and punish the
authors of any raid that might be attempted against Aracan
A year later a second letter was received demanding on the part
of the king the cession of Ramoo Chittagong Moorshedabad and
Dacca that is to say of the whole British possessions east of the
Ganges Lord Hastings simply replied that if it was possible to
suppose that the demand had been dictated by the King of Ava the
British government would be justified in regarding it as a
declaration of war To this the Burmese made no reply Doubtless
they had heard of the successes we had gained in Central India and
had learned that our whole force was disposable against them
Three years ago the old king died and a more warlike monarch
succeeded him Since 1810 they have been mixed up in the troubles
that have been going on in Assam where a civil war had been
raging One party or other has sought their assistance and
fighting has been going on there nearly incessantly and two months
ago the Burmese settled the question by themselves taking
possession of the whole country
This has of course been a serious blow to me Although disorder
has reigned it has not interfered with my trading along the banks
of the river but now that the Burmese have set up their authority
I shall for a time anyhow be obliged to give up my operations
there for they have evinced considerable hostility to ushave made
raids near Rungpoor on our side of the river and have pulled down
a British flag on an island in the Brahmaputra We have taken in
consequence the principality of Cachar under our protectionindeed
its two princes seeing that the Burmese were beginning to invade
their country invited us to take this stepand we thus occupy the
passes from Manipur into the low country of Sylhet
I wonder that you have been able to trade in Manipur uncle as
the Burmese have been masters there
I am not trading with the capital itself and the Burmese have
been too occupied with their affairs in Assam to exercise much
authority in the country Besides you see there has not been war
between the two countries Our merchants at Rangoon still carry on
their trade up the Irrawaddy and in Assam this spring the only
trouble I had was that I had to pay somewhat higher tolls than I
had done before However now that Cachar is under our protection
I hope that I shall make up for my loss of trade in Assam by
doing better than before in that province
I thought you called it Kathee uncle
So it is generally named but as it is spoken of as Cachar in the
proclamation assuming the protectorate I suppose it will be called
so in future but all these names out here are spelt pretty much
according to fancy
While this conversation had been going on the boat had been
running fast down the river passing several European vessels
almost as if they had been standing still
I should not have thought that a boat like this would pass these
large ships Stanley said
We have a good deal to learn in the art of sailing yet his
uncle replied A great many of these Indian dhows can run away
from a squarerigged ship in light weather I dont know whether
it is the lines of their hulls or the cut of the sails but there
is no doubt about their speed They seem to skim over the water
while our bluffbowed craft shove their way through it I suppose
some day we shall adopt these long sharp bows when we do it will
make a wonderful difference in our rate of sailing Then too
these craft have a very light draft of water but on the other
hand they have a deep keel which helps them to lie close to the
wind and that long overhanging bow renders them capital craft in
heavy weather for as they meet the sea they rise over it
gradually instead of its hitting them full on the bow as it does
our ships We have much to learn yet in the way of ship
building
The trader had his own servant with him and the man now came up
and said that a meal was ready and they at once entered the cabin
It was roomy and comfortable and was like the rest of the boat
of varnished teak There were large windows in the stern it had a
table with two fixed benches and there were broad low sofas on
each side Above these the muskets were disposed in racks while
at the end by the door were Tom Pearsons own rifles four brace of
pistols and a couple of swords Ten long spears were suspended
from the roof of the cabin in leather slings The floor like the
rest of the cabin was varnished
It looks very comfortable uncle
Yes you see I live quite half my time on board the rest being
spent in the boat My man is a capital cook He comes from
Chittagong and is a Mug
What are Mugs uncle
They are the original inhabitants of Aracan He was one of those
who remained there after the Burmese had conquered it and speaks
their language as well as his own I recommend you to begin it with
him at once If things settle down in Assam it will be very
useful for you in arranging with the Burmese officials You wont
find it very easy though of course your knowledge of three or four
Indian tongues will help you It is said to be a mixture of the old
Tali Sanscrit Tartar and Chinese The Tartar and Chinese words
will of course be quite new to you the other two elements will
resemble those that you are familiar with
I talk to the man in Hindustani He picked up a little of it at
Chittagong and has learned a good deal more during the two years
that he has been with me and through that you will be able to
learn Burmese
A week later the dhow entered the harbour Stanley had passed most
of his time in conversation with Khyen Toms servant The facility
his tongue had acquired in the Indian languages was of great
benefit to him and he speedily picked up a good many Burmese
sentences
For the next six months he continued with his uncle the work the
latter had carried on and enjoyed it much They sailed up the
sluggish rivers with their low flat shores in the dhow towing
the rowboat and the store boat behind them The crews of these
boats lived on board the dhow until their services were required
helping in its navigation and aiding the crew when the wind dropped
and sweeps were got out
The villages along the banks were for the most part small but were
very numerous At each of these the dhow brought up There was in
almost all cases sufficient water to allow of her being moored
alongside the banks and as soon as she did so the natives came on
board to make their purchases and dispose of their produce In
addition to the European and Indian goods carried the dhow was
laden with rice for which there was a considerable demand at most
of the villages
As soon as he had learned the price of the various goods and their
equivalent in the products of the country Stanley did much of the
bartering while his uncle went ashore and talked with the head men
of the village with all of whom he made a point of keeping on good
terms and so securing a great portion of the trade that might
otherwise have been carried by native craft
Three times during the six months the dhow had gone back to
Calcutta to fetch fresh supplies of goods and to take in another
cargo of rice while the trader proceeded higher up the river in
his own boats While on the voyage Stanley always had the rifle
and fowling piece that his uncle had handed over for his special
use leaning against the bulwark close at hand and frequently
shot waterfowl which were so abundant that he was able to keep not
only their own table supplied but to furnish the crew and boatmen
with a considerable quantity of food They had had no trouble with
river pirates for these had suffered so heavily in previous
attacks upon the dhow that they shunned any repetition of their
loss At the same time every precaution was taken for owing to the
intestine troubles in Cachar and Assam fugitives belonging to the
party that happened for the time to be worsted were driven to
take refuge in the jungles near the rivers and to subsist largely
