She thought he had possibly come to take some of the billets away
QMS met my approach with a smile that reminded me vaguely of picture
postcards I had seen  Awfully sorry to trouble me but Private Montease
just back from three weeks holiday with bronchitis was sleeping in the
woodshed on three planks and a tintack  Beamed at me and waited  Went
and bought another bedstead
Sept  16Private Montease and a cough entered into residence
Sept  17 1145 pmMaid came to bedroomdoor with some cough lozenges
which she asked me to take to the new billet  Took them  Private
Montease thanked me but said he didnt mind coughing  Said it was an
heirloom Montease cough known in highest circles all over Scotland
since time of Young Pretender
Sept  20Private Montease installed in easychair in diningroom with
touch of bronchitis looking up trains to Bournemouth
Sept  21Private Montease in bed all day  Cook anxious to do her
bit rubbed his chest with homemade embrocation  Believe it is same
stuff she rubs chests in hall with  Smells the same anyway
Sept  24Private Montease complaining of slight rawness of chest but
otherwise well returned to duty
Oct  5Cough worse again  Private Montease thinks that with care it
may turn to bronchitis  Borrowed an ABC
Oct  6Private Montease relates uncanny experience  Woke up with
feeling of suffocation to find an enormous blackcurrant and glycerine
jujube wedged in his gullet  Never owned such a thing in his life
Seems to be unaware that he always sleeps with his mouth open
Nov  14Private Bowser youngest and tallest of my billets gazetted
Nov  15 1035 amPrivate Bowser in tiptop spirits said goodbye to
us all
1045Told that QMS  Beddem desired to see me  Capitulated  New
billet Private Early armed to the teeth turned up in the evening
Said that he was a Yorkshireman  Said that Yorkshire was the finest
county in England and Yorkshiremen the finest men in the world  Stood
toying with his bayonet and waiting for contradiction
Jan  5 1916Standing in the garden just after lunch was witness to
startling phenomenon  QMS  Beddem came towards frontgate with a
smile so expansive that gate after first trembling violently on its
hinges swung open of its own accord  QMS with smile sad said he
was in trouble  Very old member of the Inns of Court Private Keen had
rejoined and he wanted a good billet for him  Would cheerfully give up
his own bed but it wasnt long enough  Not to be outdone in hospitality
by my own gate accepted Private Keen  QMS  digging hole in my path
with toe of right boot and for first and only time manifesting signs of
nervousness murmured that two lifelong friends of Private Keens had
rejoined with him  Known as the Three Inseparables  Where they were to
sleep unless I  Fled to house and locking myself in topattic
watched QMS from window  He departed with bent head and swaggercane
reversed
Jan 6Private Keen arrived  Turned out to be son of an old Chief of
mine  Resolved not to visit the sins of the father on the head of a
child six feet two high and broad in proportion
Feb  6Private Keen came home with a temperature
Feb  7MO diagnosed influenza  Was afraid it would spread
Feb  8Warned the other four billets  They seemed amused  Pointed
out that influenza had no terrors for men in No 2 Company who were
doomed to weekly nightops under Major Carryon
Feb  9House strangely and pleasantly quiet  Went to see how Private
Keen was progressing and found the other four billets sitting in a row
on his bed practising deepbreathing exercises
Feb  16Billets on nightops until late hour  Spoke in highest terms
of Major Carryons marching powersalso in other terms
March 3Waited up until midnight for Private Merited who had gone to
Slough on his motorbike
March 4 15 amAwakened by series of explosions from overworked or
badlyworked motorbike  Put head out of window and threw key to
Private Merited  He seemed excited  Said he had been chased all the way
from Chesham by a pink rat with yellow spots  Advised him to go to bed
Set him an example
110  amHeard somebody in the pantry  210  amHeard Private
Merited going upstairs to bed
216 amHeard Private Merited still going upstairs to bed
220315  amHeard Private Merited getting to bed
April 3 1230 amTownhooter announced Zeppelins and excited soldier
called up my billets from their beds to go and frighten them off
Pleasant to see superiority of billets over the hooter that only emitted
three blasts
1250 amBillets returned with exception of Private Merited who was
retained for sake of his motorbike
9 amOn way to bathroom ran into Private Merited who looking very
glum and sleepy inquired whether I had a copy of the Exchange and Mart
in the house
10 pmOverheard billets discussing whether it was worth while removing
boots before going to bed until the Zeppelin scare was over  Joined in
discussion
May 2Rumours that the Inns of Court were going under canvas
Discredited them
May 5Rumours grow stronger
May 6Billets depressed  Begin to think perhaps there is something in
rumours after all
May 9All doubts removed  Tents begin to spring up with the suddenness
of mushrooms in fields below Berkhamsted Place
May 18 LIBERATION DAYBade a facetious goodbye to my billets
response lacking in bonhomie
May 19House delightfully quiet  Presented caller of unkempt appearance
at backdoor with remains of pair of military boots three empty shaving
stick tins and a couple of partially bald toothbrushes
May 21In afternoon went round and looked at camp  Came home smiling
and went to favourite seat in garden to smoke  Discovered Private Early
lying on it fast asleep  Went to study  Private Merited at table
writing long and wellreasoned letter to his tailor  As he said he could
never write properly with anybody else in the room left him and went to
bathroom  Door locked  Peevish but familiar voice with a Scotch
accent asked me what I wanted also complained of temperature of water
May 22After comparing notes with neighbours feel deeply grateful to
QMS  Beddem for sending me the best six men in the corps
July 15Feel glad to have been associated however remotely and humbly
with a corps the names of whose members appear on the Roll of Honour of
every British regiment
THE WINTER OFFENSIVE
NBHaving regard to the eccentricities of the Law of Libel it must be
distinctly understood that the following does not refer to the
distinguished officer Lieut  Troup Horne of the Inns of Court
Anybody trying to cause mischief between a civilian of eight stone and a
soldier of seventeen by a statement to the contrary will hear from my
solicitors
Aug  29 1916We returned from the sea to find our house still our
own and the military still in undisputed possession of the remains of
the grass in the fields of Berkhamsted Place  As in previous years it
was impossible to go in search of wildflowers without stumbling over
sleeping members of the Inns of Court but war is war and we grumble as
little as possible
Sept  28Unpleasant rumours to the effect that several members of the
Inns of Court had attributed cases of curvature of the spine to sleeping
on ground that had been insufficiently rolled  Also that they had been
heard to smack their lips and speak darkly of featherbeds  Respected
neighbour of gloomy disposition said that if Pharaoh were still alive he
could suggest an eleventh plague to him beside which frogs and flies were
an afternoons diversion
Oct  3Householders of Berkhamsted busy mending bedsteads broken by
last years billets and buying patent taps for their beerbarrels
Oct  15Informed that a representative of the Army wished to see me
Instead of my old friend QMS Beddem who generally returns to life at
this time of year found that it was an officer of magnificent presence
and two pips  A fine figure of a man with a great resemblance to the
late lamented Bismarck minus the moustache and the three hairs on the
top of the head  Asked him to be seated  He selected a chair that was
all arms and legs and no hips to speak of and crushed himself into it
After which he unfastened his belt and swelled wisibly afore my werry
eyes  Said that his name was True Born and asked if it made any
difference to me whether I had one officer or halfadozen men billeted
on me  Said that he was the officer and that as the rankandfile were
not allowed to pollute the same atmosphere thought I should score
After a mental review of all I could remember of the Weights and Measures
Table accepted him  He bade a lingering farewell to the chair and
departed
Oct  16Saw QMS  Beddem on the other side of the road and gave him
an absolutely new thrill by crossing to meet him  Asked diffidentlyas
diffidently as he could that ishow many men my house would hold
Replied eightor ten at a pinch  He gave me a surprised and beaming
smile and whipped out a huge notebook  Informed him with as much regret
as I could put into a voice not always under perfect control that I had
already got an officer  QMS favouring me with a look very
appropriate to the Devils Own turned on his heel and set off in pursuit
of a ladybilletee pulling up short on the threshold of the babylinen
shop in which she took refuge  Left him on guard with a Casablancalike
look on his face
Nov  1Lieut True Born took up his quarters with us  Gave him my
dressingroom for bedchamber  Was awakened several times in the night by
what I took to be Zeppelins flying low
Nov  2Lieut True Born offered to bet me five pounds to twenty that
the war would be over by 1922
Nov  3Offered to teach me auctionbridge
Nov  4Asked me whether I could play shove hapenny
Nov  10Lieut True Born gave one of the regimental horses a riding
lesson  Came home grumpy and went to bed early
Nov  13Another ridinglesson  Overheard him asking one of the
maids whether there was such a thing as a waterbed in the house
Nov  17Complained bitterly of horsecopers  Said that his poor mount
was discovered to be suffering from saddlesoreness broken wind
splints weak hocks and two bones of the neck out of place
Dec  97 pmOne of last years billets Private Merited on leave
from a gunnery course called to see me and to find out whether his old
bed had improved since last year  Left his motorbike in the garage and
the smell in front of the diningroom window
8 to 12 pmSat with Private Merited listening to Lieut True Born on
the mistakes of Wellington
125 amRose to go to bed  Was about to turn out gas in hall when I
discovered the lieutenant standing with his face to the wall playing pat
acake with it  Gave him threeparts of a tumbler of brandy  Said he
felt better and went upstairs  Arrived in his bedroom he looked about
him carefully and then with a superb sweep of his left arm swept the
best Chippendale lookingglass in the family off the dressing table and
dived face downwards to the floor missing death and the corner of the
chest of drawers by an inch
1215 amRolled him on to his back and got his feet on the bed  They
fell off again as soon as they were cleaner than the quilt  The
lieutenant startled by the crash opened his eyes and climbed into bed
unaided
1220 amSent Private Merited for the MO Captain Geranium
1225 amMixed a dose of brandy and castoroil in a tumbler  Am told
it slips down like an oyster that waybad oyster I should think
Lieut True Born jibbed  Reminded him that England expects that every
man will take his castoroil  Reply unprintable  Apologized a moment
later  Said that his mind was wandering and that he thought he was a
colonel  Reassured him
1240 amPrivate Merited returned with the MO  Latter nicely dressed
in musicalcomedy pyjamas of ravishing hue and greatcoat with rose
tinted feet thrust into red morocco slippers  Held consultation and
explained my treatment  MO much impressed anxious to know whether I
was a doctor  Told him No but that I knew all the ropes  First give
patient castoroil then diet him and call every day to make sure that he
doesnt like his food  After that if he shows signs of getting well too
soon give him a tonic        MO stuffy
Dec  10MO diagnosed attack as due to something which True Born
believes to be tobacco with which he disinfects the house the
messsheds and the streets of Berkhamsted
Dec  11True Born shorn of thirteen pipes a day out of sixteen
disparages the whole race of MOs
Dec  14He obtains leave to attend wedding of a greataunt and
ransacks London for a specialist who advocates strong tobacco
Dec  15He classes specialists with MOs  Is surprised and
apparently disappointed that so far the breaking of the lookingglass
has brought me no illluck  Feel somewhat uneasy myself until glass is
repaired by local cabinetmaker
Jan  10 1917Lieut True Born starts to break in another horse
Feb  1Horse broken
March 3Running short of tobacco go to my billets room and try a pipe
of his  Take all the remedies except the castoroil
April 4 830 amAwakened by an infernal crash and discover that my
poor lookingglass is in pieces again on the floor  True Born explains
that its position between the open door and the open window was too
much for it  Dont believe a word of it  Shall believe to my dying day
that it burst in a frantic but hopeless attempt to tell Lieut True Born
the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
April 6The lieutenant watching for some sign of misfortune to me
Says that I cant break a mirror twice without illluck following it
Me
April 9Lieut True Born comes up to me with a face full of conflicting
emotions  Your illluck has come at last he says with gloomy
satisfaction  We go under canvas on the 23rd  You are losing me
