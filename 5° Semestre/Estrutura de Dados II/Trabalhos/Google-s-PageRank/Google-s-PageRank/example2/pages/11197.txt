expensive to be happy and also unlucrative
I have always expected to support you until your husband claimed that
privilege
Suppose I want a husband who cant support me
Dear me that would be unfortunate It is the first duty of a husband
to support his wife
Oldfashioned husbands yesbut not modern ones Lots of men marry to
be supported nowadays How on earth could I support the man I love
You are not without talents my dear
Talents You almost said accomplishments If you were not living in the
Pliocene age Professor James Parkhurst you would know that
accomplishments are a curseaccomplishment is the only thing that
counts I can sing a little play the piano a little auction bridge a
good deal I can cook and sew fancy things The only thing I can do
well is to dance and no real man wants to be supported by his
wifes toes
The Professor smiled mirthlessly Is this a general discussion or are
you leading to a specific point Bambi he inquired
Its a specific charge of incompetence against you and me Why didnt
you teach me something You know more about mathematics than the man who
invented them and I am not even sure that two and two make four
Youre young yet my dear you can learn What is it you want to
study
Success and how to get it
Success in the general sense of the word has never seemed very
important to me To do your work well
Yes I know It is the fact that you have not thought success important
that hampers me so in the choice of a husband
Bambina that is the second time a husband has been mentioned in this
discussion Have you some individual under consideration
I have I have practically decided on him
You dont tell me Do I know the young man
Oh yesJarvis Jocelyn
He has proposed to you
Oh no He doesnt know anything about it I have just decided on him
But my dear he is penniless
Thats why I reproach you that you havent brought me up to support
Jarvis in a luxury he will have to get used to
But why have you settled on this youth I seem to recall a great many
young men who are always about I presume they admire you Certainly
this dreamer is the most ineligible of them all
Oh thatyes Thats why I must take him Hell starve to death unless
some one takes him on and looks after him
Isnt there some asylum perhaps
Bambis laugh rang out like a chime
A home for geniuses Theres an idea No Professor Parkhurst Society
does not yet provide for that particular brand of incompetents
It seems as if you were going rather far in your quixotism to marry
him
Again the girl laughed
I total him up like this fine family good blood decent habits
handsome healthy poetic He might even be affectionate His one fault
is that he is not adjusted to modern commercial standards He cannot
make money or he will notit comes to the same thing
I am unable to see why you are elected to take care of him He must fit
his time or perish You dont happen to be in love with him do you
No II think not He interests me more than anybody I suppose I am
fond of him rather
Have you any reason for thinking him in love with you
Mercy no He hardly knows Im alive He uses me for a conversational
blottingpad Thats my only use in his eyes
Hes so very impractical
I am used to impractical men I have taken care of you since I was five
years old
Yes my dear But I am not trying to feed the world bread when it
demands cheese
No you are distinctly practical You are only trying to prove a fourth
dimension when three have sufficed the world up to date
Yes but
No buts If it had not been for me you would have gone naked and been
arrested or have forgotten to eat and starved to death
Now my dear Bambi I protest
It will do you no good Dont I remember how you started off to meet
your nine oclock class clad in your pyjamas
Oh my child
Dont talk to me about impracticality Its my birthright
Well I can prove to you
I never believe anything you have to prove If I cant see it first
thing without any process it isnt true
But if you represent yourself as Y and Jarvis as X an unknown
quantity
Professor Parkhurst stop there Theres nothing so unreliable as
figures and everybody but a mathematician knows that Figures lie right
to your face
Bambina if you could coin your conversation Professor Parkhurst
began
I am sorry to find you unreasonable about Jarvis Professor
He gazed at her in his absentminded startled way He had never
understood her since she was first put into his hands aged six months
a fluffy bundle of motherless babyhood She never ceased to startle him
She was an enigma beyond any puzzle in mathematics he had ever brought
his mind to bear upon
How old are you Bambina
Shame on you and you a mathematician If James is fortyfive and
Bambina is two thirds of half his age how old is Bambi Im nineteen
His startled gaze deepened
Oh you cannot be he objected
There you are I told you figures lie It says so in the family Bible
but maybe Im only two
Nineteen years old Dearie me
You see Im quite old enough to know my own mind Have you a nine
oclock class this morning
I have
Well hasten Professor or youll get a tardy mark Its ten minutes
of nine now
He jumped up from his chair and started for the door
Dont you want this notebook she called taking up the pad beside his
plate
Yes oh yes those are my notes Where have I laid my glasses Quick
my dear I must not be late
On your head said she
She followed him to the hall reminded him of his hat his umbrella
restored the notebook and finally saw him off his thin back with its
scholarly stoop disappearing down the street
Bambina went back to the breakfast table and took up the paper She
read all the want ads headed female
Nothing promising here she said I wonder if I could bring myself to
teach little kids one two and one two three in a select dancing
class Id loathe it
A ponderous black woman appeared in the door and filled it
Is you froo
Yes go ahead Ardelia
Hab the Perfessor gone already
Yes hes gone
Well he suttinly did tell me to remin him of suthin this mohnin
and I caint des perzactly bemember what it was
Was it important
Yassum Seemed lak I bemember he tell me it was impotant
Serves him right for not telling me
It suttinly am queer the way he cant bemember Seem lak his haid so
full of figgers or what you call them ain no room for nuthin else
You and father get zero in memorythats sure
I aint got no trubble dat way Miss Bambi I bemember everything
cepting wot you tell me to bemember
The diningroom door flew open at this point and a handsome youth with
his hair upstanding and his clothes in a wrinkle appeared on the
threshold Bambi rose and started for him
Jarvis she exclaimed What has happened Where have you been
Sleeping in the garden
Dats itdats it Dat was wat I was to remin the Perfessor of dat a
man was sleepin in the garden
Sleeping in our garden But why
Because of the filthy commercialism of this age Here I am at the
climax of my big play a revolutionary play I tell you teeming with
new and vital ideas for a people on the downslide and a landlady a
puny insignificant ant of a female interrupts me to demand money and
when I assure her most politely that I have none she puts me out
actually puts me out
Bambi choked back a laugh
Why didnt you come here
I did Your father refused to see me he was working at his crazy
figures I burst in and demanded you but he couldnt remember where
you had gone
What a pity Well
I told him I would wait in the garden If necessary I would sleep
there
Yasm yasm dats when he called me in to tell me to bemin him
That will do Ardelia
Yassum said the handmaiden and withdrew
Now go on
I was full of my big act so I walked and walked for hours Then I lay
down in the summerhouse and I must have gone to sleep
Go up and take a bath and come down to some breakfast I will send
Ardelia to get some of fathers things for you if you need them
All right but dont delay with breakfast If I dont get this act
down I may lose it That fiend in female guise held my paper
Go on Get ready
He plunged out and Bambi went to send Ardelia to him while she cooked
his eggs and fried his bacon As she worked she smiled out of sheer
amusement
In due course of time he appeared freshened up and with renewed
eagerness to be at work He scarcely noticed Bambina as she served his
breakfast He ate as if he were starved
I suppose the landlady held your clothes
I dont know I didnt ask It was unimportant
How much do you owe her
He looked at her in surprise
I have no idea
Have you any money at all
Certainly not Id have given it to her if I had so she wouldnt
interrupt me
What are you going to do
Oh I dont know I cant think about it now I am full of this big
idea Its a dramatization of the Brotherhood of Man of a sublime
socialistic world
Has it occurred to you ever Jarvis that the world isnt ready for
the Brotherhood of Man yet Its just out of the tent stage where War
is the whole duty of Man
But it must be ready he urged seriously for I am here with my
message
She smiled at him as one would at a conceited child
Poor old Jarvis strayed out of Elysian fields Were you thinking of
sleeping in the summerhouse permanently
Oh it doesnt matter only the play matters Give me some paper
Bambi and let me get to work
She rose and went to stand before him
Would you mind looking at me
He turned his eyes on her
Not just your eyes Jarvis Look at me with your mind
Whats the matter with you he asked slightly irritated
Do you like my looks
Ive never noticed them
Thats what Im asking you to do Look me over
He stared at her
Yes youre prettyyoure very pretty Some people might call you
beautiful
Dont overdo it Jarvis Have you ever noticed my disposition
Noyes Well I know youre patient and you must be goodnatured
I am I am also healthy and cheerful
I dont doubt it Where is the paper
She put her hands on his shoulders and shook him gently
Jarvis I want you to give me your full attention for five minutes
What ails you today Bambi
The only thing I lack is a useful education so that I am not sure I
can make a very big living just at first unless I dance on the stage
What are you driving at
Would you have any special objection to marrying me Jarvis
Marrying you Are you crazy
Obviously Have you
Certainly I wont marry you I am too busy You disappoint me Bambi
you do indeed I always thought you were such a sensible girl
Father can help out a little at first but I may as well tell you he
doesnt approve of you as a soninlaw
I dont approve of him impractical dreamer Where is that paper
Youve got to be taken care of until you get an awful tumble Then you
will wake up and do big things but in the meantime you must eat
You talk nonsense and youre interrupting me If I dont get at that
scene
Will you marry me I cant take care of you if you dont because the
neighbours will talk
I wont marry you I dont love you
No more do I love you Thats got nothing to do with it Heres one of
fathers empty notebooks Say yes and you can have it
His eyes fairly glistened as they fell on the book
For heavens sake dont torture me Give me the book and have it your
own way whatever it is you want
She laughed gave him the book and he was at the table instantly
sweeping back the dishes with a ruthless hand
No no into the study you go while I make a descent on your landlady
rescue your clothes and get the license and the minister my
liege lord
She settled him at his desk where he was immediately lost to his
surroundings
Bambi slipped out noiselessly dressed for the street humming a little
song and presently departed
Meanwhile his first recitations being over the Professor returned for
two hours research in his study to find Jarvis ensconced there
oblivious to the outside world Go away go away he shouted to
Professor Parkhurst
Ill trouble you to get out of my study said the Professor
Youll get your filthy money in due time my good woman so go away
cried Jarvis
Whom are you addressing Good woman indeed
At this moment Bambi returned and sensed the situation
Oh I didnt expect you back Father Professor This is Jarvis You see
hes come He has no objection at all to my marrying him so I got a
minister
A minister You got him
Yes you see Jarvis is busy There is no need of our waiting so we are
going to be married in half an hour or so
Today Here
Yes right here as soon as Jarvis finishes this scene
Is he going to occupy my library permanently wailed the Professor
No no Ill fix him a place on the top floor
Hes not at all my choice said Professor Parkhurst firmly gazing at
the unconscious Jocelyn You can see by the way he tosses paper about
that he is neither methodical nor orderly
Those are husband traits that I can do without thank you
Ardelia appeared
Scuse me but yo all expectin the preacher up here He say Miss
Bambi tol him to cum here at eleben oclock
Yes show him right in here
Yassum
Ardelia reappeared with the Reverend Dr Short at her heels Bambi
greeted him and Professor Parkhurst shook hands absently Bambi went to
lean over Jarvis He suddenly threw down his pen stretched himself
and groaned
Now if I can just get the last act outlined
Jarvis just a minute please
He suddenly looked at her and at the other two
This is Reverend Dr Short Mr Jarvis Jocelyn
I have nothing to say to orthodoxy Jarvis began but Bambi
interrupted him
Doctor Short has come to marry us Stand up here for a few moments and
then you can go on with your third act
She laid her hand on his arm and drew him to his feet
The shortest possible service please Doctor Short Jarvis is so busy
today
Doctor Short looked from the strange pair to Professor Parkhurst who
looked back at him
You are sure this is all right he questioned
Do tell him to be quick Bambi If its about that landlady I cannot
Sh Go ahead Doctor Short
Doctor Short read the service and between the three of them they
induced Jarvis to make the proper responses He seemed utterly unaware
of what was going on about him and at the end of a brief service when
Bambis hand was taken from his arm he sat down to work at once Bambi
led the other two men from the room
He acted as if he were drunk or drugged but he isnt Hes just full
of an idea she smilingly explained
Have you known this young man long Doctor Short asked the Professor
Have we my dear
We have known him fifteen years she answered
Well of course that makes a difference murmured the reverend
gentleman I wish you every happiness Mrs Jocelyn he added and
took his departure
How soon can you get him out of my study asked the Professor looking
at his watch I have only one hour left before lunch
Felicitate me Professor felicitate me on my marriage
I hope you will be happy my dear but I doubt it His lack of
consideration in taking my study
Bambina looked at him and began to laugh Peal followed peal of
laughter until tears stood in her eyes
Ill go rescue the study Herr Professor Oh this is too rich Bernard
Shaw ought to know about me she laughed as she tripped upstairs
So it was that Bambina acquired a husband
II
Two days later Jarvis shaved properly dressed and apparently sane
appeared on the piazza where Bambi and the Professor were at lunch He
hesitated on the threshold until they both turned toward him
Good morning he ventured
Good morning Jarvis said Bambi gayly
Morning tersely from the head of the house
Might I ask how long I have been sojourning on the top floor of this
house and how I got there
Do you mean to say you dont know
Havent an idea I have a faint recollection of a big disturbance and
then peace heavenly peace with black coffee every once in a while and
big ideas flowing like Niagara
Bambinas eyes shone at him but her father looked troubled
You know what the big disturbance was dont you he asked
It seems to me I wanted paperthat somebody was taking my things
away
Youd better tell him Francesca he doesnt remember so I dont think
it can be legal
Jarvis looked from one to the other
Whats all this I dont seem to get you
Bambis laugh bubbled over
You get me all right
For goodness sake talk sense
You came here three days ago in a trance and announced that you had
been bounced from the boardinghouse and that you needed paper to blot
up the big ideasthe Niagara ideas
Did I
So I took you in redeemed your clothes for you
It was you who planted me upstairs in that heavenly quiet place and
brought black coffee
She nodded
God bless you for it
I did something else too
Did you What
I married you
He looked at her dazed and then at the Professor
Whats the joke he asked
There is no joke said the Professor sternly She did it I tried to
stop her but she never listens to me
Do you mean Bambi he began
I mean you told me to go ahead so I got a license and a minister and
married you
But where was I when you did it
You were there I thought but it didnt seem to take Cant you
remember anything at all about it Jarvis
Not a thing Word of honour How long have we been married
Three days You couldnt come out of the play so I dragged you
upstairs fed you at stated periods and let you alone
He looked at her as if for the first time
Why Bambi he said you are a wonderful person
I have known it all along she replied sweetly
But why in Gods name did you do it
Thats what I say interpolated the Professor
Oh it just came to me when I saw you needed looking after
Dont you believe it She intended to do it all along said her
father grimly I tried to dissuade her I told her you were a dreamer
penniless and always would be but she wouldnt listen to my
practical talk
I seem to get a pretty definite idea of your opinion of me sir Why
didnt you wake me up so I could prevent this catastrophe
I supposed you were awake I didnt know you worked in a cataleptic
fit
Catastrophe echoed Bambina
Certainly Why dont you look at it in a practical way as your father
says I never had any money I probably never will I hate the stuff
Its the curse of the age
I know all that
You will be wanting food and clothes no doubt and you will expect me
to provide them
Oh never You dont think I would take such an advantage of you
Jarvis as to marry you when you were in a work fit and then expect you
to support me
The Professor shook his head in despair and arose
Its beyond me all this modern madness I wash my hands of the whole
affair
Thats right Professor Parkhurst I married him you know you
didnt
Well keep him out of my study he warned
Then he gathered up his scattered belongings and turned his absent gaze
on Bambi
What is it I want Oh yes Call Ardelia
Bambi rang and Ardelia answered the summons
Ardelia did I ask you to remind me of anything this morning
She scratched her head in deep thought
No sah nots as I recolleck It was yistiddy you tol me to remin
you and I done forgot what it was
Ardelia you are not entirely reliable he remarked as he passed her
No sah I aint jes what you call she muttered following him out
Bambi brought up the rear chuckling over this daily controversy which
never failed to amuse her
When the front door slammed she came back to where Jarvis sat his
untouched luncheon before him He watched her closely as she flashed
into the room like some swift vivid bird perching opposite him
I spoiled your luncheon she laughed
Bambi why did you do this thing
Good heavens I dont know I did it because Im I I suppose
You wanted to marry me he persisted
I thought I ought to Somebody had to look after you and I am used to
looking after father I like helpless men
So you were sorry for me It was pity
Rubbish I believe in you If you have a chance to work out your
salvation you will be a big man If you are hectored to death you will
kill yourself or compromise and that will be the end of you
You see thatyou understand
He pushed back his chair and came to her
You think that little you can stand between me and these things that I
must compromise with
She nodded at him brightly He leaned over took her two small hands
and leaned his face against them
Thank you he said simply but I wont have it
Why not
Because I am not worth it You saw me in a work fit Im a devil Im
like one possessed I swear and rave if I am interrupted I cant eat
nor sleep till I get the madness out of me I am not human I am not
normal I am not fit to live with
Very well we will build a cage at the top of the house and when you
feel a fit coming on you can go up there Ill slip you food through a
wire door so you cant bite me and Ill exhibit you for a fee as the
wildest genius in captivity
Bambi be serious This is no joke This is awful
You consider it awful to be married to me
I am not thinking of myself I am thinking of you You have got
yourself into a pretty mess and Ive got to get you out of it
How
Ill divorce you
Youve got no grounds Ive been a kind dutiful wife to you I havent
been near you since I married you except to give you food
How do you expect we are to live Nobody wants my plays
How do you know You never try to sell them You told me so yourself
You feel so superior to managers and audiences that you never
offer them
I know I occasionally go to the theatre by mistake and I see what
they want
Thats no criterion We wont condemn even a Broadway manager until he
proves himself such a dummy as not to want your plays
Broadway Think of a play of mine on Broadway Think of the fat swine
who waddle into those theatres
My dear there are men of brains writing for the theatre today who do
not scorn those swine
Men of brains Who who I ask you
Bernard Shaw
Showman trickster
Barrie
Well maybe
Pinero
Pinero knows his trade he admitted
Galsworthy Brieux
Galsworthy is a pamphleteer Brieux is no artist He is a surgeon They
have nothing to say to Broadway Broadway swallows the pills they offer
because of their names but they might just as well give them the sugar
drip they want for all the good it does
Well they get heard anyhow Whats the use of writing a play if it
isnt acted Of course well sell your plays
But if we dont where will you be
Oh Ill be all right I mean to support myself anyhow and you too
if the plays dont go
He laughed
You are an amusing mite Queer I never noticed you before
Youll like me if you continue to be aware of me Im nice she
laughed up at him and he smiled back
How do you intend to make this fortune may I ask
I havent decided yet Of course I can dance If worst came to worst I
can make a big salary dancing
Dancing he exploded
Yes didnt you ever hear of it With the feet you know and the body
and the eyes and the arms So
She twirled about him in a circle like a gay little figurine He
watched her fascinated
You can dance cant you
I can At times I am quite inspired Now if you and the Professor will
be sensible and let me go to New York and take a job I could support
us all in luxury You could write and he could figure
I dont see that it is any business of ours what you do but I
certainly wont let you support me
Do you really mean it isnt your business
Why should it be
Well if I am your wife and his daughter some people would think that
it was distantly related to your business
Why New York Why not here
In this town they think I am crazy now But if I burst out as a
professional dancerWow
Thats so Its a mean little town but its quiet Thats why I stay
Its quiet
