MONUMENTS OF THE WAR

Our triumphs gathered all across the map
Lest other topicslike the weather say
Or jazzingshould supplant the recent scrap
Or lest a future race whose careless lot
Lies in a League of Nations lapped amid
Millennial balm be unaware of what
Largely for their sakes we endured and did
Let such invite our architects to plan
Great monumental works in steel and stone
Certain to catch the eye of any man
And make our victories generally known
Let a new bridge at Charing Cross be built
In Regent Street a deathless quadrant set
And on them be inscribed in dazzling gilt
IN CASE BY INADVERTENCE WE FORGET
Or eloquent in ruin unrestored
Leave the Cloth Hall to be the pilgrims quest
Baring her ravaged beauty to record
The Culture of the Bosch when at his best

Sufficiently recall these fateful years

OS
A PAIR OF MILITARY GLOVES
It was in Italy on my way home from Egypt to be demobilised that I
decided to buy a pair of warm gloves from Ordnance
After being directed by helpful other ranks to the ASC Depot the
Camp Commandants Office and the YMCA I found myself at the end
of a mornings strenuous walking confronted by notices on a closed
door stating that this was the Officers Payment Issue Department
that this was the Officers Entrance to the Officers Payment Issue
Department that smoking was strictly prohibited and that the office
would reopen at 1400
I went away to lunch
At 1401 I knocked out my pipe conscientiously and entered From
1401 to 1450 I watched a Captain of the RAF smoking cigarettes
and choosing a pair of socks and studied notices to the effect that
this was the Officers Payment Issue Department that only Officers
were permitted to enter the Officers Payment Issue Department that
smoking was strictly prohibited and that the office would close at
1600
At last I heard the BAF man explain that by James he had an
appointment at three and would return old beaner Corporalin
the morning to see about those dashed socks The Corporal behind
the counter blew away a pile of cigarette ash and regarded me
distrustfully
Only one pair of gloves left Sir he said Gloves woollen
knitted pairs one oneandtenpence
Thank you very much I said Theyll do nicely Ill take them
now
But of course I didnt At 1500 was in another building watching
another Corporal make out an indent in quadruplicate for gloves
woollen knitted officers for the use of pairs one At 1505 I was
in another building getting the indent stamped and countersigned
At 1512 I was in another building exchanging it for a buff form in
duplicate At 1520 I reentered the Issue Department and went through
the motions of taking up the gloves
Excuse me Sir said the Corporal skilfully sliding them away you
must first produce your Field Advance Book as a proof of identity
Im afraid I havent a proper Field Advance Book I explained You
see in Egypt where I come fromthat is I was attached you know
to thewell in short I havent a proper Field Advance Book as I
said before But I have here an AB 64 issued in lieu thereofthey
do that in Egypt you knowand I have my identity discs my
demobilisation papers my chequebookoh and heaps of other things
which would prove to you that I am really me Besides my name is sewn
inside the back of my tunic And my shirt I added hopefully
If you havent a Field Advance Book Sir said the Corporal coldly
your only course is to obtain a certificate of identity from the Camp
Commandant
But look here Corporal I protested it would take me a
quarterofanhour to get to the Commandants office and another
quarter to get back Im sure I couldnt get a certificate of identity
under an hour and ahalf It is now twentyfive past three You close
at four Tomorrow morning at five ac emma I entrain for Cherbourg
You see how impossible it all is Corporal
Sorry Sir said the Corporal Im not allowed to issue the gloves
without your Field Advance Book or a certificate of identity
But what am I to do I asked weakly Think Corporal how cold it
will be across Italy and France without gloves Ive been in the East
for over four years and I might get pneumonia and die you know
I should try the Camp Commandant Sir he said It may not take so
long as you think
At 1541 I was outside the Camp Commandants office with my AB64
identity discs demobilisation papers and chequebook ready to hand
and my tunic loosened at the neck
At 1542 I entered the office with some diffidence
At 1543 I was outside again dazed and a little frightened with a
certificate of identity in my hand It was the fastest piece of work I
have ever known in the Army And I might have been Mr GEORGE ROBEY in
disguise for all they knew in the officeor cared
Sorry Sir said the Corporal in the Officers Payment Issue
Department at 1559 the gloves were sold to another officer while
you were away

We are obliged to repeat this continually to ourselves in order to
present the stern and forbidding air which is supposed to mark our
dealings with the inhabitants For look you we have usurped the
place of the Royal Jocks on the right flank of the British Army and
are on outpost duty with our right resting on the bank of the Rhine
while in front the noticeboards Limit of Cologne Bridgehead stare
at us
No longer are we the pleasant easygoing paythroughthenose people
that we were No longer does our daily routine include the smile for
Mademoiselle the chipping of Madame or the halfpenny for the little
ones No we steel ourselves steadily to the grim task entrusted to
us and struggle to offer a perfect picture of stolid indifference to
anybodys welfare but our own Feefifofum
What does Thomas think of it all Well to tell the truth I havent
caught him thinking very much about it Gloating seems foreign to his
nature somehow and I dont think he will ever make a really good
Hun He is rather like a child who for four years has been crying
incessantly for the moon Having got it he says Well Im glad
Ive got it now lets get on with something else and takes not the
slightest interest in the silly old moon he has acquired with so much
trouble
There are two things to which he cannot quite accustom himself not
being allowed to fraternize with the inhabitants and the realisation
that his laboriously acquired knowledge of the French language is no
longer of any avail He will never quite get over the former of these
two disabilities but he is coping courageously with the latter
For instance in place of the No bon of yesterday Nix goot now
explains that Your saucepan I borrowed has a hole in it please I
didnt do it For the rest change of environment makes very little
difference to him Given a cooker a watercart and the necessary
rations a British oasis will appear and be prepared to flourish in
any old desert you like
No I am wrong There is another difficulty which as yet he has not
been able entirely to overcome I cannot describe the consternation
which came over the Company when I informed them that there was no
longer any need to scrounge in fact I forbade it At first they
thought it was just a Company Commanders humour and paid it the usual
compliments of the parade but when they found I was serious they were
simply appalled It was as if I had taken the very spice out of their
existence Not to be able to go out and win a handful of fuel for
the evenings fug and for the brewing of those unwholesome messes in
the tin canteen Bolshevism itself could not have propounded a more
revolutionary principle Heartbroken some of the old soldiers came
to me afterwards What are we to do Sir they said We only go
on guard four hours in sixteen we must do something the rest of the
time Sternly I bade them think of scrounging as a thing of the
pasta thing of glorious memory only to be spoken of round the fires
at home If they wanted anything in the meantime to add to their
material comfort they were to come to me for it
For let me tell you all you demobilised wallahs who know only those
countries where the necessities of life were matters of private
enterpriselet me tell you that in this village if I say that I
require coal coal is here and with it the Buergermeister inquiring
politely if my needs are satisfied We must have beds The spare beds
of the village are forthcoming If we want baths for the men our
Mr Carfax who speaks a language which the inhabitants pretend to
understand goes round to the householders and explains the necessity
Should there be any difficulty he explains further that it would be
much better dont they think and much more convenient if the
men visited the houses rather than that baths should be carried to
some central place It is invariably found to be preferable for all
concerned
Bathing has now become a pleasure to all except perhaps to
Nijinsky our Pole from Commercial Road East On being presented
for the first time I gather to a firstclass bathroom with geyser
complete he evinced signs of great uneasiness In fact he seemed to
think that this was making a parade of a purely private matter The
SergeantMajor being called in exhorted him to get in and give the
thing a trial at which Nijinsky flung up his hands in characteristic
fashion and said Vell its somethink fur nothink anyhow and
they left him to it The rest of the story is concerned with his
turning off the water in the geyser and leaving the gas on of a loud
explosion and the figure of Nijinsky fat and frightened fleeing
through the main street dressed in an Army towel Subsequently I heard
him expressing forcibly a fixed determination never never to be
persuaded against his will again
Oh yes it is a wonderful thing to be a Hun Every day we go about
telling one another what Huns we are and how we love our hunnishness
And yet you know as a matter of fact I dont believe all our
efforts amount to anything really they wouldnt deceive a childand
in fact they dont For ever since we came here one cant help
noticing that the little tiny natives have acquired an extraordinarily
good imitation of Tommys salute and though Subalterns and
SergeantMajors may go about gnashing their teeth and wearing
expressions of frightful ferocity still the youngsters grin
fearlessly as they raise their tiny fingers They know it isnt real
They know a Hun when they see him all right what child doesnt
And I caught our Mr Carfax picking one of them up from the gutter the
other day and soothing its tears with the babytalk of all nations I
told him he was fraternising abominably and was not being a true Hun
Well he said you cant leave a child yelling in a puddle can
you
And damn it you cant so whats the use of trying to be hunnish

THE GREAT COLDCURE DEBATE
In view of the prevalence of colds and the varying counsels given to
their patients by our leading socalled healers a mass meeting of
doctors and public men was recently convened with the hope that some
useful results might follow
None did
The Chairman in his opening remarks said that colds were at once
the commonest complaints to which human beings were subject and the
least understood by the faculty It was scandalous that so little
serious attention should be paid to them by physicians A scientific
investigator should be as proud of discovering a preventive for colds
as a scheme of wireless telegraphy But it was not so Researchers
were applauded for compounding new and more deadly explosives and
poisonous gas while the whole mystery of colds remained unplumbed
The situation was scandalous Loud sneezes
Letters were read among others from Lord NORTHCLIFFE Mr SNOWDEN
and Sir JOHN SIMON all saying that from recent experience they could
affirm that an equable cold temperature was conducive to the avoidance
of catarrh In short an excellent means of escaping cold was to be
out in the cold
A representative of the Board of Trade said that all that was
necessary to avoid colds was to keep fit and not approach infection
Having offered this very practical advice the speaker gathered up his
papers and left the room
Sir Septicus Jermyn the famous physician urged that the best
preventive for colds was to keep warm One should wear plenty of thick
clothing and especially cover the neck and throat A respirator was an
excellent thing He even went so far as to recommend earflaps to his
patients with beneficial results A nightcap was also a great help
Sir Eufus Hardy the famous physician protested that colds were for
the most part negligible People took them much too seriously The
best treatment was to be Spartanwear the lightest clothes abjure
mufflers and whenever you could find a draught sit in it
Mr BERNARD SHAW said that all this coldcatching was nonsense He
personally had never had a cold in his life And why Because he lived
healthily he wore natural wool retained his beard ate no meat and
drank no wine Lunatics who wore fancy tweeds shaved devoured their
fellowcreatures and imbibed poisonous acids were bound to catch cold
Resuming his Jaeger halo Mr SHAW then left
Sir Bluffon Gay the famous physician stated that in his experience
colds were necessary evils which often served useful ends in clearing
the system For that reason he was against any treatment that served
to stop them The instantaneous cold cures which were advertised so
freely filled him with suspicion Colds should be unfettered
Mr Le Hay Fevre KC representing the Ancient Order of
Haberdashers said that he was in entire agreement with the last
speaker Colds should be allowed to take their course Nothing was
so bad as to check them
Sir Romeo Path the famous physician asserted that colds were far
more serious things than people thought As a matter of fact there
was no such thing as a cold pure and simple colds were invariably
manifestations of other and deeper trouble His own specific was a
long period of complete rest and careful but not meagre dieting
followed by change of air if necessary travel to the South of France
Loud coughs and cheers
Mr Bolus KC representing the Chemists and Druggists Union said
that it was felt very strongly that the seriousness of colds should
not be minimised but that foreign travel was an error No malady was
so much helped by the timely and constant employment of remedies at
home He trusted that the remarks of the last speaker would speedily
be contradicted by a competent authority
Sir Consul Tait the famous physician held that alcohol was the
greatest provocative of colds aspirin was their greatest enemy
Sir Tablloyd George the famous physician observed that a glass
of hot whisky and lemonjuice on going to bed was a sovran remedy
Aspirin was to be avoided but quinine had its uses
Mr ARNOLD BENNETT said that probably no one knew more about the way
that other people should behave than he did He had written twelve
manuals on the subject and intended to write twentysix more by which
time he would have covered the whole field of human endeavour Any one
who had read his book The Plain Man and his Wife and their Plainer
Children would remember that one chapter was devoted to the cause
evasion and cure of colds He would not at the moment say more than
that the work was procurable at all bookshops He should like to
address the meeting at fuller length but as he was suffering from a
very stubborn cold he must hurry back to bed
Mr HG WELLS remarked that he always found that the best corrective
for a cold was to write another novel of modern domestic life He had
even heard of the perusal of some of his novels as a substitute for
coal
Mr BONAR LAW said that there was no prophylactic against colds so
efficacious as fresh air and plenty of it Since he had formed the
habit of flying backwards and forwards from Paris he had been free
from any trouble of that kind He recommended a seat at the Peace
Conference and constant aviation to all sufferers
Sir Blandon Swaive the famous physician contended that there was no
sense in the freshair theory Rooms should be hermetically sealed
Mr SMILLIE said that he had given the matter the closest attention
and he had come to the conclusion that there was no preventive of a
cold in the head so complete and drastic as decapitation
The meeting was considering Mr SMILLIES suggestion when our
reporter who had contracted a chill during Mr BERNARD SHAWS
remarks took his departure

My Dear CharlesYou are a lawyer and you ought to know Yet to
myself when I compare my profits with those of the Government in this
deal I seem a model of innocence
Let me refresh your memory of the facts
In the Spring of 1918 I was dispensing passports to deserving cases in
the name of His Majestys Government In the neutral country where I
was doing this there was a very wicked and a very plausible man whom
we will call Mr Abrahams he has had so many surnames at one time and
another that a new one cannot do him any harm Rate of exchange stood
at the figure of twenty local francs to the pound sterling and as
you would put it other things were equal
Mr Abrahams was obsessed with a desire to see England entirely for
its own sake England also thinking entirely of itself was obsessed
with a desire not to see Mr Abrahams Mr Abrahams came to my office
said nice things about me to my face and begged me to let him go
I said nice things to him and told him I would if I could but I
couldnt He took this to mean I could if I would but I wouldnt He
offered me cash down a cheque for five pounds sterling or a note for
a hundred francs I could have it which way I liked We should call it
for appearance sake a gift to His Majestys Government for the better
prosecution of the War
I thanked him cordially on behalf of His Majestys Government but
regretted that I was the victim of circumstances over which I had no
control Refusing to believe there could be any circumstances which
could stand up against an officer of my power position and force he
produced a note for a hundred francs and put it on my table He then
withdrew meaning I gathered to return to the attack as soon as the
money had sunk in From this point on Mr Abrahams disappears from
the story It is not the first or only story as the police will tell
you from which Mr Abrahams has disappeared
My report to His Majestys Government did not omit a full mention of
the matter of the five pounds or hundred francs offered It begged for
instructions as to the disposal of the booty which it stated lay in
my Suspense basket No instructions could be got though frequent
messages saying May we now have an answer please were sent
Weeks passed and every morning I was tempted by the sight of that
note for a hundred francs lying in the basket My moral gradually
declined So did the rate of exchange So did the barometer
There came a day the weather being such that any man who could sin
would sin when I had in my pocket a cheque made out for five pounds
which I was about to cash for lack of ready francs and when the
rate of exchange had got as low as nineteen francs to the pound
which would mean I rely entirely on the evidence of the bank man
ninetyfive francs for my five pounds Charles I fell Explaining to
myself that Mr Abrahams had clearly intimated that his gift to the
Government was alternatively a cheque for five pounds or a note for
a hundred francs I put my cheque into the Suspense basket and
pocketed the note thus making five francs profit
More weeks passed no instructions came and every day I was tempted
by the sight of that cheque One bright summer morning when any man
who had any goodness in him could not help being good and when the
rate of exchange had risen to twentyone I came to my office full
of noble intentions and hundred franc notes of my own I may mention
in passing that it takes very little money to fill me up I had just
cashed a cheque of my own at the rate of a hundredandfive francs to
the five pounds and I felt robust and selfconfident and ready to
do it again There on the top of my Suspense basket lay just the
very cheque for the purpose Charles I fell again Explaining to
myself that Mr Abrahams had clearly intimated that his gift to the
Government was alternatively a note for a hundred francs or a cheque
for five pounds I put a note for a hundred francs into the Suspense
basket and pocketed the cheque thus making another five francs
profit
That my Lord is the case for the prosecution but you may as well
