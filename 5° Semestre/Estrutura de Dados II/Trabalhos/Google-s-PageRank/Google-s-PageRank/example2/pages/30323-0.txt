PREFACE
A few years since the Editor of the following pages published a volume of
aReligious Creeds and Statisticsa and as the work although quite
limited met with general approbation he has been induced to publish
another of the same nature but on a much larger plan trusting that it
will prove more useful and more worthy of public favor
His design has been to exhibit to his readers with the utmost
impartiality and perspicuity and as briefly as their nature will permit
the views creeds sentiments or opinions of all the religious sects or
denominations in the world so far as utility seemed to require such an
exhibition but more especially to give the rise progress and
peculiarities of all the principal schemes or systems of religion which
exist in the United States at the present day
The work is intended to serve as a manual for those who are desirous of
acquiring with as little trouble as possible a correct knowledge of the
tenets or systems of religious faith presented for the consideration of
mankindato enable them almost at a glance to compare one creed or
system with another and each with the holy Scripturesato settle the
minds of those who have formed no definite opinions on religious
subjectsaand to lead us all by contrasting the sacred truths and sublime
beauties of Christianity with the absurd notions of pagan idolaters of
skeptics and of infidels to set a just value on the doctrines of HIM WHO
SPAKE AS NEVER MAN SPAKE
To accomplish this design the Editor has obtained from the most
intelligent and candid among the living defenders of each denomination
full and explicit statements of their religious sentimentsasuch as they
believe and teach He is indebted to the friends of some new sects or
parties in philosophy and religion for an account of their respective
views and opinions With regard to anterior sects he has noticed from
the best authorities as large a number as is thought necessary for the
comparison of ancient with modern creeds
The Church and Missionary Statistics are believed to be as accurate as can
be constructed from materials which annually undergo greater or less
changes
The Biographical Sketches are derived from the most authentic sources
While they convey useful knowledge in regard to the fathers and defenders
of the various systems of religious faith they may also stimulate our
readers to the practice of those Christian virtues and graces which
adorned the lives of many of them and render their names immortal
A few only of the works from which valuable aid has been received can be
mentionedaMosheim and McLaineas Ecclesiastical History Gregory and
Ruteras Church History EncyclopAdia Americana Brownas Encyclopedia of
Religious Knowledge Adamsas View of Religions and History of the Jews
Benedictas History of all Religions Evansas Sketches Buckas and
Hendersonas Theological Dictionaries Eliotas Allenas and Blakeas
Biographical Dictionaries Davenport Watson Grantas Nestorians
Colemanas Christian Antiquities Ratio DisciplinA Haydnas Dictionary of
Dates c
To clergymen and laymen of all denominations who have assisted the Editor
in presenting their various views with clearness and fairness to the
secretaries of the several missionary boards to editors of religious
journals and to other persons who have kindly furnished documents for the
Statistics and Biographical Sketches he tenders acknowledgments of
unfeigned gratitude
While the Editor assures the public that the whole has been prepared with
much diligence and care and with an entire freedom from sectarian zeal or
party bias he cannot but indulge the hope that his aBook of Religionsa
will prove acceptable and beneficial to the community as imbodying a
great variety of facts on a subject of deep concern worthy of the
exercise of our highest faculties and requiring our most charitable
conclusions
