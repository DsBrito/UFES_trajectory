Man of the Book thou Pilgrim of the Road
The love of travel
Drave thee on ever with pursuing goad
Trust was thy burning light Truth was thy load
Sweet riddles for the weary to unravel
Within thy breast
Glowed the pure fire of an Eternal Quest
2
The Bible was thy chart the open sky
Thy roof and rafter
Often and thou didst learn nights mystery
Learning some tale from each poor passerby
Some gracious secret for the grand Hereafter
Master of lore
Occult and wanderer on the wildest shore
3
What country was not trodden by thy feet
Nor bared its bosom
And fragrance to the life it leapt to greet
From field and upland or where waters meet
Was stolen the virgin dew the veiled blossom
Its native tongue
On stranger lips in every climate hung
4
Pursuer of shy paths all hunted things
All creatures lonely
Gypsy and fox and hawk with slanted wings
These drank with thee at the same cosmic springs
These were thy teachers and thy playmates only
Nature gave up
To them and thee alike her hidden cup
5
Who brought its glory back to cloistered Wales
And wrung their treasure
From sacred books and dim sequestered vales
Who found the gold in haunted heights and dales
And showed a wondering world its pride and pleasure
Divine and strong
Stood out the altar with its flame of song
6
Thy bardlike power the passion of thy thirst
For something greater
Awoke old Cymric melodies the first
Till all the mountains into music burst
And their lost glory crowned the recreator
Outpoured as wine
Thy magic words made every shade a shrine
7
Priest of the portals into the Unknown
Taught by no college
And free of every fountain but thine own
A waif an exile by the breezes blown
Hither and thither to fresh fields of knowledge
That giant form
Fearless and still no moment rode the storm
8
From land to land a pilgrim yet at home
Whereer thy journey
Thou didst a dweller in the Eternal come
The dust thy floor the heaven of stars thy dome
To break a lance for Truth in some new tourney
With Nature blent
Art thou and the wide world thy monument
9
Thou gypsy of all time no lot seems strange
No life was sterile
To that free spirit wrought by rugged change
Thy heart found rest in strife and did outrange
The farthest fancy and woo the sorest peril
Hardships and lack
Were comrades and the milestones on thy track

GEORGE HENRY BORROW
The time is ripe and over ripe for a commemorative celebration of
George Borrow in a city with which he was so long and so intimately
associated as he was with Norwich  His increasing fame as a foremost
literary man of the nineteenth century is amply witnessed to by the
various biographies of him and the numerous appreciations of him by
writers of repute and Mr Clement Shorters forthcoming Life of Borrow
will certainly add to the cult
The following sketch of this wayward genius is mainly devoted to
outstanding characteristics with necessarily brief accounts of his works
and journeyings  It seems convenient to sum up his career in the four
divisions which follow
Section I
180315EARLY WANDERING DAYS
Borrows father Thomas Borrow was a patriotic pugnacious but
Godfearing Cornishman born at an old homestead known as Trethinnick in
the parish of St Cleer in which his forbears had been settled well back
in the seventeenth century probably earlier  To quote Dr Knapp They
feared God honoured the king and believed in piskies and Holy Wells
Thomas Borrow handsome tall and muscular was an adept in the athletic
sports for which Cornwall is famous and early signalised himself by his
prowess as a boxer  As he grew up George Borrow himself became an
ardent admirer of the Fancy and when asked What is the best way to
get through life quietly was wont to say Learn to box and keep a
civil tongue in your head
In 1778 when nineteen years of age Thomas Borrow was articled for five
years to a maltster but just as that period expired at Menheniot Fair a
bicker arose in which Borrow and other young heroes triumphed over the
braves of that town  Constables appeared but were promptly felled by
the brawny Borrow and to crown his misdeeds he knocked over the
headborough who happened to be his maltster master  He wisely fled
and shortly after enlisted as a private soldier in the Coldstream Guards
and was soon quartered in London  In 1792 as a sergeant he was
transferred to the West Norfolk Regiment of Militia with headquarters at
East Dereham  A company of players from Norwich frequently visited that
nice little town and in one of them appeared as a supernumerary Ann
Perfrement the pretty daughter of a small farmer of Dumpling Green on
the outskirts of the town  This maiden of Huguenot descent fascinated
the Cornish soldier and the two were married at Dereham Church on
February 11th 1793  The regiment was then about to start a wandering
course over the highways of Englandat Colchester in Norfolk then at
Sheerness Sandgate and Dover at Colchester once more in Kent Essex
again and then in 18023 at East Dereham where George was born July
5th 1803 in the house of his maternal grandparents  On July 17th he
was baptized George Henry names of the king and of the eldest brother of
Captain Thomas Borrow

Murray
As a mere infant Borrow was gloomy and fond of solitude ever
conscious he says of a peculiar heaviness within me and at times of
a strange sensation of fear which occasionally amounted to horror and
for which I could assign no real cause whatever  Of this earliest
period he tells a characteristic story of drawing strange lines in the
dust with his fingers when a Jew pedlar came up and said The child is
a sweet child and he has all the look of one of our own people but
when he leaned forward to inspect the lines in the dust started back
and grew white as a sheet then taking off his hat he made some strange
gestures to me cringing chattering    and shortly departed
muttering something about holy letters and talking to himself in a
strange tongue  This in the first chapter of Lavengro is in the
true Borrovian mysteryman style
Picture George Borrows birthplace Dumpling Green East Dereham
Again and again Borrow throughout his life suffered from some nervous
ailment which defied definition thus when he was fifteen his strength
and appetite deserted him and he pined and drooped but an ancient
female a kind of doctress who had been his nurse in his infancy gave
him a decoction of a bitter root growing on commons and desolate places
from which he took draughts till he was convalescent  In any estimate of
Borrows life the strange attacks of what he called the Fear or the
Horrors must be taken into account  At times they even produced a
suicidal tendency as when in 1824 he wrote to his friend Roger
Kerrison Come to me immediately I am I believe dying  The
facsimile of this note in Knapps Life of Borrow is as tremulous as if
the writer was suffering from delirium tremens which of course he was
not
Picture Roger Kerrison
We have in Lavengro a very interesting account of the boy Borrow being
taken twice every Sunday to the fine parish church at East Dereham
where from a corner of a spacious pew he would fix his eyes on the
dignified highChurch rector and the dignified highChurch clerk from
whose lips would roll many a portentous word descriptive of the wondrous
works of the Most High  The rector was the Rev F J H Wollaston
BD who was himself patron of the living which reverted to the Crown
in 1841  At East Dereham too he came in touch with that exquisite old
gentlewoman Lady Fenn widow of Sir John Fenn editor of the Paston
Letters as she passed to and fro from her mansion on some errand of
bounty or of mercy leaning on her goldheaded cane whilst the sleek old
footman walked at a respectful distance behind  But Borrows admiration
for Philo the clerk was greatestPeace to thee thou fine old chap
despiser of dissenters and hater of papists as became a dignified and
highChurch clerk
Leaving Dereham in April 1810 Captain Borrow and his family were
transferred to Norman Cross in the parish of Yaxley some four miles
from Peterborough to guard a large number of French prisoners in sixteen
long casernes or barracks  At this place little Borrow now seven years
old made a friend quite to his liking in a wild sequestered spot which
was his favourite haunt for he was allowed to pass his time principally
in wandering about the neighbouring country  It was at this wild nook he
came to know a vipercatcher and herbalist a quaint figure in a skin
cap and with stout gaiters who was catching a viper when the boy first
made his acquaintance  What do you think of catching such a thing as
that with the naked hand asked the old fellow  What do I think said
I  Why that I could do as much myself  This ruffled the old mans
pride but later he became quite friendly and explained that he hunted
the vipers for their fat to make unguents especially for rheumatism and
also collected simples knowing he virtues of such as had medicinal
value  On one of his excursions this primitive sportsman told him the
marvellous tale of the King of the Vipers  The old fellow was wakened
from his sleep one sultry day by a dreadful viper moving towards
himall yellow and gold    bearing its head about a foot and ahalf
above the ground the dry stubble crackling beneath its outrageous belly
then it lifted its head and chest high in the air and high over my
face as I looked up flickering at me with its tongue as if it would fly
at my face  Child continued the narrator what I felt at that moment
I can scarcely say but it was a sufficient punishment for all the sins I
ever committed and there we two were I looking up at the viper and the
viper looking down upon me flickering at me with its tongue  Happily a
sharp gun report close at hand frightened the reptile away  Before
leaving the neighbourhood the vipercatcher presented his child friend
with a specimen which he had tamed and rendered harmless by removing the
fangs  This creature the queer boy fed with milk and often carried with
him in his walks
This episode resulted in experiences which coloured all the rest of
Borrows life for soon after when he first came among gypsy tents and
saw the longhaired woman with skin dark and swarthy like that of a toad
and a particularly evil expression and when her husband threatened to
baste the intruder with a ladle the boy broke forth into what in Romany
would be called a gillie or ditty ending
My father lies concealed within my tepid breast
And if to me you offer any harm or wrong
Ill call him forth to help me with his forked tongue
The story cannot be mangled without losing its wild significance but on
further threats Borrow to use his own words made a motion which the
viper understood and now partly disengaging itself from my bosom where
it had lain perdu it raised its head to a level with my face and stared
upon my enemy with its glittering eyes
The superstitious gypsies were effectively terrified and invited the lad
into their tent Dont be angry and say no but look kindly upon us
and satisfied my precious little God Almighty
They had taken him for a goblin but when he explained that he was not
one of them there the man said You are a sapengro a chap who
catches snakes and plays tricks with them  Then when the boy
proceeded to read them a bit of Robinson Crusoe it was voted that it
beat the rubricals hollow  Next followed the momentous meeting with
Ambrose Smiththe Jasper Petulengro of Borrows pagesand as the band
of gypsies were departing Jasper turning round leered into the little
Gorgios face held out his hand and said Goodbye Sap I daresay we
shall meet again remember we are brothers two gentle brothers  Gazing
after the retreating company the sapengro said to himself A strange
set of people I wonder who they can be  Such was Borrows first
introduction to the Romany folk
From July 1811 to July 1814 the Borrows led a nomadic life yet at
each tarryingplace Captain Borrow sent his sons to the best school
available and George in these three years travelling with the
regiment acquired Lillys Latin Grammar by heart  A Dereham
schoolmaster had assured Captain Borrow that there is but one good
school book in the worldthe one I use in my seminaryLillys Latin
Grammar  There is it may be added good evidence that Shakespeare was
taught out of this venerable work
Early in 1813 our interesting family were in Edinburgh where the Borrow
boys were sent to the celebrated High School and George entered with
zest into the faction fights between the Auld and the New Toon  More
and better than this he picked up just such a wild character as fitted
in with his romantic scheme of things  This was David Haggart son of a
gamekeeper and guilty of nearly every crime in the Statute Book under
various aliasesJohn Wilson John Morrison John McColgan David
OBrien and The Switcher  Haggart enlisted as a drummerboy in
Captain Borrows recruitingparty at Leith Races in July 1813 being
then just twelve years old but soon tiring of discipline and scanty pay
obtained his discharge soon after embarking on a career of crime which
culminated in his welldeserved hanging at Edinburgh in 1821 at the age
of twenty

Tuck
In June 1814 the West Norfolk Regiment was ordered south some went by
sea those who preferred by land  Captain Borrow chose the latter and
on July 18th his division entered Norwich and the Earl of Orford
colonel of the regiment entertained the officers and their friends at
the Maids Head Hotel  At this time Captain Borrow and his family went
to lodge at the Crown and Angel an ancient hostelry in St Stephens
Street  From that convenient centre the recruitingparties under
Captain Borrow were very successful in obtaining men by beat of drum
instead of by ballot as had previously been the practice  But troubles
arose in Ireland and in August 1815 the West Norfolks were again on
the move  They found themselves at Cork early in September and marched
on to Clonmel
During their short interval at Norwich George went to the Grammar
School and his brother studied painting with Old Crome
Picture The Grammar School
Captain Borrow commanded a division and George walked by his side
holding the stirrupleather of his horse while John Thomas Borrow
gazetted ensign in May and lieutenant in December was in his place in
the regiment  At Clonmel the Borrows lodged with a handsome athletic man
and his wife who enthusiastically welcomed them  I have made bold to
bring up a bottle of claret said the Orangeman    and when your
honour and your family have dined I will make bold too to bring up
Mistress Hyne from Londonderry to introduce to your honours lady and
then well drink to the health of King George God bless him to the
glorious and immortalto Boyne waterto your honours speedy
promotion to be LordLieutenant
Here at Clonmel our hero read the Latin tongue and the Greek letters
with a nice old clergyman who sat behind a black oaken desk with a huge
Elzevir Flaccus before him  Here says Borrow I was in the habit of
sitting on a large stone before the roaring fire in the huge open
chimney and entertaining certain of the Protestant young gentlemen of my
own age    with extraordinary accounts of my own adventures and those
of the corps with an occasional anecdote extracted from the storybooks
of Hickathrift and Wight Wallace pretending to be conning the lesson all
the while  Borrow calls Hickathrift his countryman the legend is that
Tom Hickathrift ridded the Fenland between Lynn and Wisbech of a
monstrous giant by slaying him with the axletree of his cart  I gave
the full story of this Norfolk giantkiller in the Gentlemans
Magazine for January 1896  The boys genius for story telling was
quite exceptional and when he was at Norwich Grammar School as his
schoolfellow Dr Martineau informed me He used to gather about him
three or four favourite schoolfellows after they had learned their class
lesson and before the class was called up and with a sheet of paper and
book on his knee invent and tell a story making rapid little pictures
of each Dramatis Persona  The plot was woven and spread out with
much ingenuity and the characters were various and welldiscriminated
But two of them were sure to turn up in every tale the Devil and the
Pope and the working of the drama invariably had the same issuethe
utter ruin and disgrace of these two Potentates
At Clonmel it was his good luck to make friends with one more notable
character another figure in his gallery of strange personagesMurtagh
a Papist gasoon sent to school by his father to be made a saggrart of
and sent to Paris and Salamanca  But the gasoon loved cards better
George had a new pack which soon changed hands  You cant learn Greek
so you must teach Irish said George  Before Christmas Murtagh was
playing at cards with his brother Denis and I could speak a considerable
quantity of broken Irish
In January 1816 the regiment was moved on to Templemore a charming
town in midTipperary where the Borrows remained but a short time
reaching Norwich again on May 13th and tarrying at the Crown and Angel
till they settled at the historic little house in Kings Court Willow
Lane which they leased from a builder named Thomas King  At the
instance of Sir Peter Eade it was renamed Borrows Court and the
tablet commemorating the residence there of George Borrow was affixed on
November 6th 1891  Now by the generosity of the Lord Mayor of Norwich
Arthur Michael Samuel in this year of grace 1913 it has become a
possession of the City of Norwich as a Borrow Museum in perpetuity
At Templemore George Borrow tall and largelimbed for a lad of thirteen
still had adventures for on an excursion to visit his brother at
Loughmore he encountered the fierce Dog of Peace and its master Jerry
Grant the outlawa fairy man in league with fairies and spirits and
able to work much harm by supernatural means on which account the
peasants held him in great awe  The account of Sergeant Bagges
encounter with this wizardly creature is in Borrows best style  The
sergeant thought he had the fellow fast by the throat but suddenly the
man seemed to melt away from his grasp and the wind howled more and
more and the night poured down darker and darker the snow and the sleet
thicker and more blinding  Lord have mercy upon us said Bagge who
concluded that the tussle was not fair but something Irish and
supernatural  I daresay comments George to his brother hes
right  I have read of witchcraft in the Bible
At Templemore too our boy of thirteen learned to ride mounted on a
tremendous gallant specimen of the genuine Irish cob said by Borrow to
be nearly extinct in his day  This horse had been the only friend in the
world of his groom but after a blow would not let him mount  So young
Borrow mounted the animal barebacked for said the groom If you are
ever to be a frank rider you must begin without a saddle    leave it
all to him  Following the grooms directions the cob gave his young
rider every assistance and great was the lads joy  Oh that ride
that first ridemost truly it was an epoch in my existence and I still
look back to it with feelings of longing and regret  People may talk of
first loveit is a very agreeable event I daresaybut give me the
flush and triumph and glorious sweat of a first ride like mine on the
mighty cob    By that one trial I had become free    of the whole
equine species  Thus began Borrows passion for the equine race and he
avows that with him the pursuit of languages was always modified by his
love of horses  As a wonderful pendant to this riding exploit Borrow
tells the tale of the Irish smith who by a magical word which thrilled
the boy absolutely maddened the cob until the wizard soothed it by
uttering another word in a voice singularly modified but sweet and
almost plaintive
With this weird episode ends the tale as coloured up and poetized in
Lavengro of Borrows earliest journeyings and adventures truly in his
case adventures were to the adventurous  Having had all the wild
experiences just outlined small wonder that the strange lad was not very
adaptable when as a free scholar he came under the rule of the Rev
Edward Valpy at Norwich Grammar School
Section II
NORWICH 181624SCHOOL LAW AND LANGUAGES
The crisscross experiences of his boyhood together with his mixed
Cornish and Gallic heredity were elements that very largely helped to
create the whimsical character of George Borrow  We have now come to the
time when the old soldier with his pension of eight shillings a day and
his excellent and devoted wife settled with their two sons at the little
house in Willow Lane Norwich
Picture Borrows House Willow Lane
For a short time in 1814 when his parents lodged in St Stephens young
George was sent to the Grammar School but now in 1816 settled
comfortably in Norwich he was again sent to the Grammar School under
the Rev Edward Valpy called by Dr Knapp a severe master by Mr
Walling a martinet whose principal claims to fame says Mr Jenkins
are his severity his having flogged the conqueror of the Flaming
Tinman and his destruction of the School Records of Admission which
dated back to the sixteenth century  Against this chorus of
denunciation I will quote from a letter the late Dr Martineau wrote me
about Borrow It is true that I had to hoist not horse Borrow for
his flogging but not that there was anything exceptional or capable of
leaving permanent scars in the infliction Mr Valpy was not given to
excess of that kind  It is a pity that the earliest biographers did not
get the opinion of some of Borrows surviving schoolfellows as to their
old master  Dr Knapp in 1899 stated that Dr Martineau died January
11th 1900 and Dr W E Image DL JP of Herringswell House
Suffolk died September 26th 1903 were the only survivors of Borrows
schoolmates  Amongst these was Thomas Borrow Burcham the London Police
Magistrate who there is good reason to believe was a cousin of
Georges as his father married a Mary Perfrement and T B Burcham was
christened at East Dereham Church

It is quite noteworthy that Borrow makes no mention of his term at the
Grammar School in Lavengro but after his Irish experiences opens a
chapter with the following eloquent description of Norwich
A fine old city truly is that view it from whatever side you
will but it shows best from the east where the ground bold and
elevated overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it stands
Gazing from those heights the eye beholds a scene which cannot fail
to awaken even in the least sensitive bosom feelings of pleasure
and admiration  At the foot of the heights flows a narrow and deep
river with an antique bridge communicating with a long and narrow
suburb flanked on either side by rich meadows of the brightest
green beyond which spreads the city the fine old city perhaps the
most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old English
town  Yes there it spreads from north to south with its venerable
houses its numerous gardens its thrice twelve churches its mighty
mound which if tradition speaks true was raised by human hands to
serve as the grave heap of an old heathen king who sits deep within
it with his sword in his hand and his gold and silver treasures
about him  There is a grey old castle upon the top of that mighty
mound and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil from
among those noble forest trees behold that old Norman masterwork
that cloud encircled cathedral spire around which a garrulous army
of rooks and choughs continually wheel their flight  Now who can
wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud of her and
offer up prayers for her prosperity  I myself who was not born
within her walls offer up prayers for her prosperity that want may
never visit her cottages
It was yonder to the west that the great naval hero of Britain
first saw the light he who annihilated the sea pride of Spain and
dragged the humble banner of France in triumph at his stern  He was
born yonder to the west and of him there is a glorious relic in that
old town in its dark flint guildhouse the roof of which you can
just descry rising above that maze of buildings in the upper hall of
justice is a species of glass shrine in which the relic is to be
seen a sword of curious workmanship the blade is of keen Toledan
steel the heft of ivory and motherofpearl  Tis the sword of
Cordova won in the bloodiest fray off St Vincents promontory and
presented by Nelson to the old capital of the muchloved land of his
birth  Yes the proud Spaniards sword is to be seen in yonder
guildhouse in the glass case affixed to the wall many other relics
has the good old town but none prouder than the Spaniards sword
After these descriptive passages he at once passes to the questionings
of his father and mother as to the career of the other child much more
difficult to settle in life than his more soberminded elder brother who
had as Dr Martineau informed me quite too much sense to join in the
wild escapade described by Dr Knapp in one of his most purple patches
Captain Borrow was sadly exercised about his younger son and exclaimed
in the discussion about his prospects Why he has neither my hair nor
eyes and then his countenance  Why tis absolutely swarthy God
forgive me  I had almost said like that of a gypsy but I have nothing
to say against that the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his
face nor for his hair and eyes but then his ways and manners
Our glimpses of the Grammar School life are meagre but we can readily
understand that to a lad of Borrows temperament the routine of a
wellordered school was naturally distasteful though he loved to gain
knowledge from any unconventional source open to him  So we find him
studying French and Italian with one banished priest the Rev Thomas
DEterville MA of Caen University who as Borrow says lived in an
old court of the old town having come to Norwich in 1793  He
advertised his school in St Andrews and this was situated in
Lockets Yard now built over by Messrs Harmers factory  Later he
resided in the Strangers Hall then occupied by priests of the adjoining
Roman Catholic Chapel of St John now superseded by the grand church
which towers on the crest of St Giless Hill  The Norman priest was
robust with a slight stoop but a rapid and vigorous step sixty or
thereabouts when Borrow was his pupil in 1816 according to Lavengro
But he was really considerably younger for when he died at Caen
February 22nd 1843 his age was given as seventysix  In a local
obituary notice he was described as a wellknown and respected
inhabitant of Norwich for upwards of forty years who retired a few
months ago to end his days in his native country  He made a small
fortune and there were rumours that he was engaged in the contraband
trade  In a suppressed passage reproduced by Dr Knapp in his notes to
Lavengro DEterville says he found friends here and was able to ride
a good horse to visit pupils in the country also that he always carried
pistols which Borrow said he had seen  Here then was another
character after Borrows heart especially as he told his pupil that one
day he would be a great philologist  Of course young Borrow was by no
means the sort of lad to spend all his time on books  He loved to sally
forth with an old condemned musket and did such execution that he seldom
returned sad to say without a string of bullfinches blackbirds and
linnets hanging round his neck  Yet as Mr Jenkins says Borrows love
of animals was almost feminine  With less zest he went fishingtoo
listless a pastime to interest him much for he often fell into a doze by
the water side and sometimes let his rod drop into the stream  His
poetical but strictly accurate account of Earlham is worth quoting
At some distance from the city behind a range of hilly ground which
rises towards the southwest is a small river the waters of which
after many meanderings eventually enter the principal river of the
district and assist to swell the tide which it rolls down to the
ocean  It is a sweet rivulet and pleasant it is to trace its course
from its springhead high up in the remote regions of East Anglia
till it arrives in the valley behind yon rising ground and pleasant
is that valley truly a goodly spot but most lovely where yonder
bridge crosses the little stream  Beneath its arch the waters rush
