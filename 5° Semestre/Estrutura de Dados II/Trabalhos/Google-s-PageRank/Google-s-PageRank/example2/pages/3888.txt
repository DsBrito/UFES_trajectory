make their appearance in the balcony  The Queen gave me the key of the
inner doors which led to the Dauphins apartments and desired me to go
to the Duchesse de Polignac to tell her that she wanted her son and had
directed me to bring him myself into her room where she waited to show
him to the people  The Duchess said this order indicated that she was not
to accompany the Prince  I did not answer she squeezed my hand saying
Ah Madame Campan what a blow I receive  She embraced the child and me
with tears  She knew how much I loved and valued the goodness and the
noble simplicity of her disposition  I endeavoured to reassure her by
saying that I should bring back the Prince to her but she persisted and
said she understood the order and knew what it meant She then retired to
her private room holding her handkerchief to her eyes  One of the
undergovernesses asked me whether she might go with the Dauphin I told
her the Queen had given no order to the contrary and we hastened to her
Majesty who was waiting to lead the Prince to the balcony
Having executed this sad commission I went down into the courtyard where
I mingled with the crowd  I heard a thousand vociferations it was easy
to see by the difference between the language and the dress of some
persons among the mob that they were in disguise  A woman whose face
was covered with a black lace veil seized me by the arm with some
violence and said calling me by my name I know you very well tell
your Queen not to meddle with government any longer let her leave her
husband and our good States General to effect the happiness of the
people  At the same moment a man dressed much in the style of a
marketman with his hat pulled down over his eyes seized me by the other
arm and said Yes yes tell her over and over again that it will not be
with these States as with the others which produced no good to the
people that the nation is too enlightened in 1789 not to make something
more of them and that there will not now be seen a deputy of the Tiers
Etat making a speech with one knee on the ground tell her this do you
hear  I was struck with dread the Queen then appeared in the balcony
Ah said the woman in the veil the Duchess is not with herNo
replied the man but she is still at Versailles she is working
underground molelike but we shall know how to dig her out  The
detestable pair moved away from me and I reentered the palace scarcely
able to support myself  I thought it my duty to relate the dialogue of
these two strangers to the Queen she made me repeat the particulars to
the King
About four in the afternoon I went across the terrace to Madame Victoires
apartments three men had stopped under the windows of the thronechamber
Here is that throne said one of them aloud the vestiges of which will
soon be sought for  He added a thousand invectives against their
Majesties  I went in to the Princess who was at work alone in her
closet behind a canvass blind which prevented her from being seen by
those without  The three men were still walking upon the terrace I
showed them to her and told her what they had said  She rose to take a
nearer view of them and informed me that one of them was named
SaintHuruge that he was sold to the Duc dOrleans and was furious
against the Government because he had been confined once under a lettre
de cachet as a bad character
The King was not ignorant of these popular threats he also knew the days
on which money was scattered about Paris and once or twice the Queen
prevented my going there saying there would certainly be a riot the next
day because she knew that a quantity of crown pieces had been distributed
in the faubourgs
I have seen a sixfranc crown piece which certainly served to pay some
wretch on the night of the 12th of July the words Midnight 12th July
three pistols were rather deeply engraven on it  They were no doubt a
password for the first insurrection MADAME COMPAN
On the evening of the 14th of July the King came to the Queens
apartments where I was with her Majesty alone he conversed with her
respecting the scandalous report disseminated by the factious that he had
had the Chamber of the National Assembly undermined in order to blow it
up but he added that it became him to treat such absurd assertions with
contempt as usual I ventured to tell him that I had the evening before
supped with M Begouen one of the deputies who said that there were very
respectable persons who thought that this horrible contrivance had been
proposed without the Kings knowledge  Then said his Majesty as the
idea of such an atrocity was not revolting to so worthy a man as M
Begouen I will order the chamber to be examined early tomorrow morning
In fact it will be seen by the Kings speech to the National Assembly
on the 15th of July that the suspicions excited obtained his attention
I know said he in the speech in question that unworthy insinuations
have been made I know there are those who have dared to assert that your
persons are not safe can it be necessary to give you assurances upon the
subject of reports so culpable denied beforehand by my known character
The proceedings of the 15th of July produced no mitigation of the
disturbances  Successive deputations of poissardes came to request the
King to visit Paris where his presence alone would put an end to the
insurrection
On the 16th a committee was held in the Kings apartments at which a most
important question was discussed whether his Majesty should quit
Versailles and set off with the troops whom he had recently ordered to
withdraw or go to Paris to tranquillise the minds of the people  The
Queen was for the departure  On the evening of the 16th she made me take
all her jewels out of their cases to collect them in one small box which
she might carry off in her own carriage  With my assistance she burnt a
large quantity of papers for Versailles was then threatened with an early
visit of armed men from Paris
The Queen on the morning of the 16th before attending another committee
at the Kings having got her jewels ready and looked over all her
papers gave me one folded up but not sealed and desired me not to read
it until she should give me an order to do so from the Kings room and
that then I was to execute its contents but she returned herself about
ten in the morning the affair was decided the army was to go away
without the King all those who were in imminent danger were to go at the
same time  The King will go to the Hotel de Ville tomorrow said the
Queen to me he did not choose this course for himself there were long
debates on the question at last the King put an end to them by rising and
saying Well gentlemen we must decide am I to go or to stay  I am
ready to do either  The majority were for the King staying time will
show whether the right choice has been made  I returned the Queen the
paper she had given me which was now useless she read it to me it
contained her orders for the departure I was to go with her as well on
account of my office about her person as to serve as a teacher to Madame
The Queen tore the paper and said with tears in her eyes When I wrote
this I thought it would be useful but fate has ordered otherwise to the
misfortune of us all as I much fear
After the departure of the troops the new administration received thanks
M Necker was recalled  The artillery soldiers were undoubtedly
corrupted  Wherefore all these guns  exclaimed the crowds of women who
filled the streets  Will you kill your mothers your wives your
childrenDont be afraid answered the soldiers these guns shall
rather be levelled against the tyrants palace than against you
The Comte dArtois the Prince de Conde and their children set off at the
same time with the troops  The Duc and Duchesse de Polignac their
daughter the Duchesse de Guiche the Comtesse Diane de Polignac sister
of the Duke and the Abbe de Baliviere also emigrated on the same night
Nothing could be more affecting than the parting of the Queen and her
friend extreme misfortune had banished from their minds the recollection
of differences to which political opinions alone had given rise  The
Queen several times wished to go and embrace her once more after their
sorrowful adieu but she was too closely watched  She desired M Campan
to be present at the departure of the Duchess and gave him a purse of
five hundred Louis desiring him to insist upon her allowing the Queen to
lend her that sum to defray her expenses on the road  The Queen added
that she knew her situation that she had often calculated her income and
the expenses occasioned by her place at Court that both husband and wife
having no other fortune than their official salaries could not possibly
have saved anything however differently people might think at Paris
M Campan remained till midnight with the Duchess to see her enter her
carriage  She was disguised as a femme de chambre and got up in front of
the Berlin she requested M Campan to remember her frequently to the
Queen and then quitted for ever that palace that favour and that
influence which had raised her up such cruel enemies  On their arrival at
Sens the travellers found the people in a state of insurrection they
asked all those who came from Paris whether the Polignacs were still with
the Queen  A group of inquisitive persons put that question to the Abbe
de Baliviere who answered them in the firmest tone and with the most
cavalier air that they were far enough from Versailles and that we had
got rid of all such bad people  At the following stage the postilion got
on the doorstep and said to the Duchess Madame there are some good
people left in the world I recognised you all at Sens  They gave the
worthy fellow a handful of gold
On the breaking out of these disturbances an old man above seventy years
of age gave the Queen an extraordinary proof of attachment and fidelity
M Peraque a rich inhabitant of the colonies father of M dOudenarde
was coming from Brussels to Paris while changing horses he was met by a
young man who was leaving France and who recommended him if he carried
any letters from foreign countries to burn them immediately especially if
he had any for the Queen  M Peraque had one from the Archduchess the
Gouvernante of the Low Countries for her Majesty  He thanked the
stranger and carefully concealed his packet but as he approached Paris
the insurrection appeared to him so general and so violent that he
thought no means could be relied on for securing this letter from seizure
He took upon him to unseal it and learned it by heart which was a
wonderful effort for a man at his time of life as it contained four pages
of writing  On his arrival at Paris he wrote it down and then presented
it to the Queen telling her that the heart of an old and faithful subject
had given him courage to form and execute such a resolution  The Queen
received M Peraque in her closet and expressed her gratitude in an
affecting manner most honourable to the worthy old man  Her Majesty
thought the young stranger who had apprised him of the state of Paris was
Prince George of HesseDarmstadt who was very devoted to her and who
left Paris at that time
The Marquise de Tourzel replaced the Duchess de Polignac  She was
selected by the Queen as being the mother of a family and a woman of
irreproachable conduct who had superintended the education of her own
daughters with the greatest success
The King went to Paris on the 17th of July accompanied by the Marechal de
Beauvau the Duc de Villeroi and the Duc de Villequier he also took the
Comte dEstaing and the Marquis de Nesle who were then very popular in
his carriage  Twelve Body Guards and the town guard of Versailles
escorted him to the Pont du Jour near Sevres where the Parisian guard
was waiting for him  His departure caused equal grief and alarm to his
friends notwithstanding the calmness he exhibited  The Queen restrained
her tears and shut herself up in her private rooms with her family  She
sent for several persons belonging to her Court their doors were locked
Terror had driven them away  The silence of death reigned throughout the
palace they hardly dared hope that the King would return  The Queen had
a robe prepared for her and sent orders to her stables to have all her
equipages ready  She wrote an address of a few lines for the Assembly
determining to go there with her family the officers of her palace and
her servants if the King should be detained prisoner at Paris  She got
this address by heart it began with these words Gentlemen I come to
place in your hands the wife and family of your sovereign do not suffer
those who have been united in heaven to be put asunder on earth  While
she was repeating this address she was often interrupted by tears and
sorrowfully exclaimed They will not let him return
It was past four when the King who had left Versailles at ten in the
morning entered the Hotel de Ville  At length at six in the evening M
de Lastours the Kings first page arrived he was not half an hour in
coming from the Barriere de la Conference to Versailles  Everybody knows
that the moment of calm in Paris was that in which the unfortunate
sovereign received the tricoloured cockade from M Bailly and placed it
in his hat  A shout of Vive le Roi arose on all sides it had not been
once uttered before  The King breathed again and with tears in his eyes
exclaimed that his heart stood in need of such greetings from the people
One of his equerries M de Cubieres told him the people loved him and
that he could never have doubted it  The King replied in accents of
profound sensibility
Cubieres the French loved Henri IV and what king ever better deserved
to be beloved
Louis XVI cherished the memory of Henri IV at that moment he thought
of his deplorable end but he long before regarded him as a model
Soulavie says on the subject A tablet with the inscription Resurrexit
placed upon the pedestal of Henri IVs statue on the accession of Louis
XVI flattered him exceedingly  What a fine compliment said he if it
were true  Tacitus himself never wrote anything so concise or so happy
Louis XVI wished to take the reign of that Prince for a model  In the
following year the party that raised a commotion among the people on
account of the dearness of corn removed the tablet inscribed Resurrexit
from the statue of Henri IV and placed it under that of Louis XV whose
memory was then detested as he was believed to have traded on the
scarcity of food  Louis XVI who was informed of it withdrew into his
private apartments where he was found in a fever shedding tears and
during the whole of that day he could not be prevailed upon either to
dine walk out or sup  From this circumstance we may judge what he
endured at the commencement of the Revolution when he was accused of not
loving the French peopleNOTE BY THE EDITOR
His return to Versailles filled his family with inexpressible joy in the
arms of the Queen his sister and his children he congratulated himself
that no accident had happened and he repeated several times Happily no
blood has been shed and I swear that never shall a drop of French blood
be shed by my ordera determination full of humanity but too openly
avowed in such factious times
The Kings last measure raised a hope in many that general tranquillity
would soon enable the Assembly to resume its labours and promptly bring
its session to a close  The Queen never flattered herself so far M
Baillys speech to the King had equally wounded her pride and hurt her
feelings  Henri IV conquered his people and here are the people
conquering their King  The word conquest offended her she never
forgave M Bailly for this fine academical phrase
Five days after the Kings visit to Paris the departure of the troops
and the removal of the Princes and some of the nobility whose influence
seemed to alarm the people a horrible deed committed by hired assassins
proved that the King had descended the steps of his throne without having
effected a reconciliation with his people
M Foulon adjoint to the administration while M de Broglie was
commanding the army assembled at Versailles had concealed himself at
Viry  He was there recognised and the peasants seized him and dragged
him to the Hotel de Ville  The cry for death was heard the electors the
members of committee and M de La Fayette at that time the idol of
Paris in vain endeavoured to save the unfortunate man  After tormenting
him in a manner which makes humanity shudder his body was dragged about
the streets and to the Palais Royal and his heart was carried by women
in the midst of a bunch of white carnations  M Berthier M Foulons
soninlaw intendant of Paris was seized at Compiegne at the same time
that his fatherinlaw was seized at Viry and treated with still more
relentless cruelty
The Queen was always persuaded that this horrible deed was occasioned by
some indiscretion and she informed me that M Foulon had drawn up two
memorials for the direction of the Kings conduct at the time of his being
called to Court on the removal of M Necker and that these memorials
contained two schemes of totally different nature for extricating the King
from the dreadful situation in which he was placed In the first of these
projects M Foulon expressed himself without reserve respecting the
criminal views of the Duc dOrleans said that he ought to be put under
arrest and that no time should be lost in commencing a prosecution
against him while the criminal tribunals were still in existence he
likewise pointed out such deputies as should be apprehended and advised
the King not to separate himself from his army until order was restored
His other plan was that the King should make himself master of the
revolution before its complete explosion he advised his Majesty to go to
the Assembly and there in person to demand the cahiers
Cahiers the memorials or lists of complaints grievances and
requirements of the electors drawn up by the primary assemblies and sent
with the deputies
and to make the greatest sacrifices to satisfy the legitimate wishes of
the people and not to give the factious time to enlist them in aid of
their criminal designs  Madame Adelaide had M Foulons two memorials
read to her in the presence of four or five persons  One of them Comte
Louis de Narbonne was very intimate with Madame de Stael and that
intimacy gave the Queen reason to believe that the opposite party had
gained information of M Foulons schemes
It is known that young Barnave during an aberration of mind since
expiated by sincere repentance and even by death uttered these atrocious
words Is then the blood now flowing so pure when M Berthiers son
came to the Assembly to implore the eloquence of M de Lally to entreat
that body to save his fathers life  I have since been informed that a
son of M Foulon having returned to France after these first ebullitions
of the Revolution saw Barnave and gave him one of those memorials in
which M Foulon advised Louis XVI to prevent the revolutionary explosion
by voluntarily granting all that the Assembly required before the 14th of
July  Read this memorial said he I have brought it to increase your
remorse it is the only revenge I wish to inflict on you  Barnave burst
into tears and said to him all that the profoundest grief could dictate
CHAPTER II
After the 14th of July by a manoeuvre for which the most skilful factions
of any age might have envied the Assembly the whole population of France
was armed and organised into a National Guard  A report was spread
throughout France on the same day and almost at the same hour that four
thousand brigands were marching towards such towns or villages as it was
wished to induce to take arms  Never was any plan better laid terror
spread at the same moment all over the kingdom  In 1791 a peasant showed
me a steep rock in the mountains of the Mont dOr on which his wife
concealed herself on the day when the four thousand brigands were to
attack their village and told me they had been obliged to make use of
ropes to let her down from the height which fear alone had enabled her to
climb
Versailles was certainly the place where the national military uniform
appeared most offensive  All the Kings valets even of the lowest class
were metamorphosed into lieutenants or captains almost all the musicians
of the chapel ventured one day to make their appearance at the Kings mass
in a military costume and an Italian soprano adopted the uniform of a
grenadier captain  The King was very much offended at this conduct and
forbade his servants to appear in his presence in so unsuitable a dress
The departure of the Duchesse de Polignac naturally left the Abbe de
Vermond exposed to all the dangers of favouritism  He was already talked
of as an adviser dangerous to the nation  The Queen was alarmed at it
and recommended him to remove to Valenciennes where Count Esterhazy was
in command  He was obliged to leave that place in a few days and set off
for Vienna where he remained
On the night of the 17th of July the Queen being unable to sleep made me
watch by her until three in the morning  I was extremely surprised to
hear her say that it would be a very long time before the Abbe de Vermond
would make his appearance at Court again even if the existing ferment
should subside because he would not readily be forgiven for his
attachment to the Archbishop of Sens and that she had lost in him a very
devoted servant  Then she suddenly remarked to me that although he was
not much prejudiced against me I could not have much regard for him
because he could not bear my fatherinlaw to hold the place of secretary
of the closet  She went on to say that I must have studied the Abbes
character and as I had sometimes drawn her portraits of living
characters in imitation of those which were fashionable in the time of
Louis XIV she desired me to sketch that of the Abbe without any
reserve  My astonishment was extreme the Queen spoke of the man who the
day before had been in the greatest intimacy with her with the utmost
coolness and as a person whom perhaps she might never see again  I
remained petrified the Queen persisted and told me that he had been the
enemy of my family for more than twelve years without having been able to
injure it in her opinion so that I had no occasion to dread his return
however severely I might depict him  I promptly summarised my ideas about
the favourite but I only remember that the portrait was drawn with
sincerity except that everything which could denote antipathy was kept
out of it  I shall make but one extract from it I said that he had been
born talkative and indiscreet and had assumed a character of singularity
and abruptness in order to conceal those two failings  The Queen
interrupted me by saying Ah how true that is  I have since discovered
that notwithstanding the high favour which the Abbe de Vermond enjoyed
the Queen took precautions to guard herself against an ascendency the
consequences of which she could not calculate
On the death of my fatherinlaw his executors placed in my hands a box
containing a few jewels deposited by the Queen with M Campan on the
departure from Versailles of the 6th of October and two sealed packets
each inscribed Campan will take care of these papers for me  I took
the two packets to her Majesty who kept the jewels and the larger packet
and returning me the smaller said Take care of that for me as your
fatherinlaw did
After the fatal 10th of August 1792The day of the attack on the
Tuileries slaughter of the Swiss guard and suspension of the King from
his functionswhen my house was about to be surrounded I determined to
burn the most interesting papers of which I was the depositary I thought
it my duty however to open this packet which it might perhaps be
necessary for me to preserve at all hazards I saw that it contained a
letter from the Abbe de Vermond to the Queen I have already related that
in the earlier days of Madame de Polignacs favour he determined to remove
from Versailles and that the Queen recalled him by means of the Comte de
Mercy  This letter contained nothing but certain conditions for his
return it was the most whimsical of treaties I confess I greatly
regretted being under the necessity of destroying it  He reproached the
Queen for her infatuation for the Comtesse Jules her family and society
and told her several truths about the possible consequences of a
friendship which ranked that lady among the favourites of the Queens of
France a title always disliked by the nation  He complained that his
advice was neglected and then came to the conditions of his return to
Versailles after strong assurances that he would never in all his life
aim at the higher church dignities he said that he delighted in an
unbounded confidence and that he asked but two things of her Majesty as
essential the first was not to give him her orders through any third
person and to write to him herself he complained much that he had had no
letter in her own hand since he had left Vienna then he demanded of her
an income of eighty thousand livres in ecclesiastical benefices and
concluded by saying that if she condescended to assure him herself that
she would set about procuring him what he wished her letter would be
sufficient in itself to show him that her Majesty had accepted the two
conditions he ventured to make respecting his return  No doubt the letter
was written at least it is very certain that the benefices were granted
and that his absence from Versailles lasted only a single week
In the course of July 1789 the regiment of French guards which had been
in a state of insurrection from the latter end of June abandoned its
colours  One single company of grenadiers remained faithful to its post
at Versailles  M le Baron de Leval was the captain of this company  He
came every evening to request me to give the Queen an account of the
disposition of his soldiers but M de La Fayette having sent them a note
they all deserted during the night and joined their comrades who were
enrolled in the Paris guard so that Louis XVI on rising saw no guard
whatever at the various posts entrusted to them
The decrees of the 4th of August by which all privileges were abolished
are well known
It was during the night of the 4th of August says Rivarol that the
demagogues of the nobility wearied with a protracted discussion upon the
rights of man and burning to signalise their zeal rose all at once and
with loud exclamations called for the last sighs of the feudal system
This demand electrified the Assembly  All heads were frenzied  The
younger sons of good families having nothing were delighted to sacrifice
their too fortunate elders upon the altar of the country a few country
cures felt no less pleasure in renouncing the benefices of others but
what posterity will hardly believe is that the same enthusiasm infected
the whole nobility zeal walked hand in hand with malevolence they made
sacrifice upon sacrifice  And as in Japan the point of honour lies in a
mans killing himself in the presence of the person who has offended him
so did the deputies of the nobility vie in striking at themselves and
their constituents  The people who were present at this noble contest
increased the intoxication of their new allies by their shouts and the
deputies of the commons seeing that this memorable night would only
afford them profit without honour consoled their selflove by wondering
at what Nobility grafted upon the Third Estate could do  They named
that night the night of dupes the nobles called it the night of
sacrificesNOTE BY THE EDITOR
The King sanctioned all that tended to the diminution of his own personal
gratifications but refused his consent to the other decrees of that
tumultuous night this refusal was one of the chief causes of the ferments
of the month of October
In the early part of September meetings were held at the Palais Royal and
propositions made to go to Versailles it was said to be necessary to
separate the King from his evil counsellors and keep him as well as the
Dauphin at the Louvre  The proclamations by the officers of the commune
for the restoration of tranquillity were ineffectual but M de La Fayette
succeeded this time in dispersing the populace  The Assembly declared
itself permanent and during the whole of September in which no doubt the
preparations were made for the great insurrections of the following month
the Court was not disturbed
The King had the Flanders regiment removed to Versailles unfortunately
the idea of the officers of that regiment fraternising with the Body
Guards was conceived and the latter invited the former to a dinner which
was given in the great theatre of Versailles and not in the Salon of
Hercules as some chroniclers say  Boxes were appropriated to various
persons who wished to be present at this entertainment  The Queen told me
she had been advised to make her appearance on the occasion but that
under existing circumstances she thought such a step might do more harm
than good and that moreover neither she nor the King ought directly to
have anything to do with such a festival  She ordered me to go and
desired me to observe everything closely in order to give a faithful
account of the whole affair
The tables were set out upon the stage at them were placed one of the
Body Guard and an officer of the Flanders regiment alternately  There was
a numerous orchestra in the room and the boxes were filled with
spectators  The air O Richard O mon Roi was played and shouts of
Vive de Roi shook the roof for several minutes  I had with me one of
my nieces and a young person brought up with Madame by her Majesty They
were crying Vive le Roi with all their might when a deputy of the Third
Estate who was in the next box to mine and whom I had never seen called
to them and reproached them for their exclamations it hurt him he said
to see young and handsome Frenchwomen brought up in such servile habits
screaming so outrageously for the life of one man and with true
fanaticism exalting him in their hearts above even their dearest
relations he told them what contempt worthy American women would feel on
seeing Frenchwomen thus corrupted from their earliest infancy  My niece
replied with tolerable spirit and I requested the deputy to put an end to
the subject which could by no means afford him any satisfaction inasmuch
as the young persons who were with me lived as well as myself for the
sole purpose of serving and loving the King  While I was speaking what
was my astonishment at seeing the King the Queen and the Dauphin enter
the chamber  It was M de Luxembourg who had effected this change in the
Queens determination
The enthusiasm became general the moment their Majesties arrived the
orchestra repeated the air I have just mentioned and afterwards played a
song in the Deserter Can we grieve those whom we love  which also
made a powerful impression upon those present on all sides were heard
praises of their Majesties exclamations of affection expressions of
regret for what they had suffered clapping of hands and shouts of Vive
le Roi Vive la Reine Vive le Dauphin  It has been said that white
cockades were worn on this occasion that was not the case the fact is
that a few young men belonging to the National Guard of Versailles who
were invited to the entertainment turned the white lining of their
national cockades outwards  All the military men quitted the hall and
reconducted the King and his family to their apartments  There was
intoxication in these ebullitions of joy a thousand extravagances were
committed by the military and many of them danced under the Kings
windows a soldier belonging to the Flanders regiment climbed up to the
balcony of the Kings chamber in order to shout Vive le Roi  nearer his
Majesty this very soldier as I have been told by several officers of the
corps was one of the first and most dangerous of their insurgents in the
riots of the 5th and 6th of October  On the same evening another soldier
of that regiment killed himself with a sword  One of my relations
chaplain to the Queen who supped with me saw him stretched out in a
corner of the Place dArmes he went to him to give him spiritual
assistance and received his confession and his last sighs He destroyed
himself out of regret at having suffered himself to be corrupted by the
enemies of his King and said that since he had seen him and the Queen
and the Dauphin remorse had turned his brain
I returned home delighted with all that I had seen
I found a great many people there  M de Beaumetz deputy for Arras
listened to my description with a chilling air and when I had finished
told me that all that had passed was terrific that he knew the
disposition of the Assembly and that the greatest misfortunes would
follow the drama of that night and he begged my leave to withdraw that he
might take time for deliberate reflection whether he should on the very
next day emigrate or pass over to the left side of the Assembly He
adopted the latter course and never appeared again among my associates
On the 2d of October the military entertainment was followed up by a
breakfast given at the hotel of the Body Guards  It is said that a
discussion took place whether they should not march against the Assembly
but I am utterly ignorant of what passed at that breakfast  From that
moment Paris was constantly in commotion there were continual mobs and
the most virulent proposals were heard in all public places the
conversation was invariably about proceeding to Versailles  The King and
Queen did not seem apprehensive of such a measure and took no precaution
against it even when the army had actually left Paris on the evening of
