CHAPTER I
going to the big house to live
Hortenses father put the letter back into its envelope and handed it
across the table to her mother
I hadnt expected anything of the kind he said but it makes the
plan possible provided
Hortense knew very well what Papa and Mamma were talking about for she
was ten years old and as smart as most girls and boys of that age But
she went on eating her breakfast and pretending not to hear Papa and
Mamma were going a long way off to Australia provided Grandmother and
Grandfather would care for Hortense in their absence So Mamma had
written and this was the answer
Would you like to stay with Grandfather and Grandmother while Papa and
Mamma are away her mother asked
Hortense would like it very much for she had never been in her
grandfathers house Grandfather and Grandmother had always visited her
at Christmas and other times and she had imagined wonderful stories of
the house that she had never seen All her father would tell of it when
she asked him was that it was large and oldfashioned Once only she
had heard him say to her mother It would be a strange house for a
child
Strange houses were her delight In a strange house anything might
happen Always in fairy tales and wonder stories the houses were
deliriously strange
So when her mother asked her the question Hortense answered promptly
Yes mam
Im afraid youll have no one to play with Mamma said but there
will be nice books to read and a large yard to enjoy Besides the
house itself is very unusual If you were an imaginative child it might
be a littlebut then you arent imaginative
Yes mam said Hortense
She supposed Mamma was right If she were really imaginative no doubt
she would have seen a fairy long ago But though she looked in every
likely spot never had she seen any except once and that time she
wasnt sure
My little girl is sensible and not likely to be easily frightened at
any unusual or strange her father began
I shouldnt Henry Mamma interrupted swiftly
No perhaps not Papa agreed
No more was said but Hortense knew very well that going to
Grandfathers house would be a grand and delightful adventure and that
almost anything might happen provided she were imaginative enough She
reread all her fairy tales by way of preparation and her dreams grew
so exciting that at times she was sorry to wake up in the morning
Meanwhile Papa and Mamma were busy packing and putting things away in
closets Finally the day came when Hortense kissed her mamma goodby
and cried a little and Papa took her to the station and after talking
to the conductor put her on the train
The conductor said he would take good care that Hortense got off at the
right station then Papa found a seat for her by a window put her
trunk check in her purse and her box of lunch and her handbag beside
her kissed her goodby and told her to be a brave girl
He stood outside her window until the train started then he waved his
hand and Hortense saw him no more However she felt sad only for a
minute or two for he was going to Australia and was going to bring her
something very interesting possibly a kangaroo She had asked for a
kangaroo and Papa had shaken his head doubtfully and said hed see
But Papa always did that to make the surprise greater
It was an interesting trip and Hortense wasnt tired a bit The
conductor came in several times and asked her many questions about her
grandfather and her grandmother He also told her about his own little
girl who was just Hortenses age and a wonder at fractions
When it was time for lunch the porter brought her a little table upon
which she spread the contents of her box and she had a pleasant
luncheon party with an imaginary little boy named Henry It was all the
nicer because she had to eat all Henrys sandwiches and cookies
whereas if Henry had been a real little boy he would have eaten them
all himself and probably some of hers too
After luncheon the train went more slowly as it climbed into the
mountains and all the rest of the way Hortense looked out of the
window She had never seen big mountains before Then about four
oclock in the afternoon the conductor came and told her to get ready
When the train stopped he helped her off called All aboard though
there was nobody to get on and the train drew away and disappeared
Hortense was all alone and there was nobody resembling her grandfather
or her grandfathers old coachman to meet her She felt very lonesome
until a man with a bright metal plate on his cap which read Station
Agent came to her and asked her name and where she belonged
So youre Mr Douglas granddaughter said he and are going to the
big house to live Well well I guess Uncle Jonah will be along pretty
soon
Hortense went with him and looked up the long street of the little
town The station agent shaded his eyes with his hand
I guess thats Uncle Jonah now said he and Hortense saw an
oldfashioned surrey with a fringed top drawn by two very fat black
horses They were very lazy horses and it seemed a long time before
they drew up at the station and Uncle Jonah climbed painfully out
Uncle Jonah was very old and black and his hair was white and kinky
Yos Miss Hortense isnt yo he asked I come fo to git yo Ise
kinda late cause Tom an Jerry dey jes santered along
The station agent and Uncle Jonah lifted Hortenses steamer trunk into
the back seat of the surrey and with Hortense sitting beside Uncle
Jonah off they went
Shed better look out for ghosts up at the big house hadnt she
Uncle Jonah the station agent called after them
Uncle Jonah grunted
Are there ghosts at Grandfathers house Hortense asked feeling a
delightful shiver up her back
Cose not said Uncle Jonah uneasily Dats jes his foolishness
Id like to see a ghost said Hortense
Uncle Jonah stared at her
Me I don mix up wid no hants said he When I hears em rampagin
roun at night I pulls de kivers up an shuts mah eyes tight
What do they sound like Uncle Jonah Hortense asked breathlessly
But Uncle Jonah would not answer Instead he clucked to the horses and
not another word could Hortense get from him for a long time They
drove through the little town and out into the country toward the
mountains
Is the house right among the mountains Hortense asked at last
It sho is said Uncle Jonah Des a mountin slap in de back yard
Goody said Hortense I like mountains
Deys powahful oncomfotable grumbled Uncle Jonah
He stopped the horses on the top of a little hill and pointed with his
whip
Des de house he said dat big one wid de cupalo
Hortense looked as directed Below them at the foot of a steep
mountain was a tall house with a cupola It was three stories high
oldfashioned and had high shuttered windows The cupola attracted
Hortense particularly She thought she would like to sit high inside
and look through the little windows One could see ever so far and
could pretend one were in a lighthouse or on the mast on a ship
Tom and Jerry walked slowly down the long hill At its foot was a
little house surrounded by a low hedge A boy of about Hortenses age
was playing in the yard He stopped and stared at Hortense as she
passed and Hortense stared back Then the boy did a handspring and
waved his hand
Whats that boys name Hortense asked
Uncle Jonah raised his eyes
Good fo nothin muttered Uncle Jonah Ef I catches him in my
ochad agin Ill lambaste him good
He looks like a nice boy said Hortense
Dey aint no nice boys said Uncle Jonah Dey all needs a lickin
Tom and Jerry turned in at a graveled driveway and trotted through a
large lawn set with big trees and clumps of shrubbery They stopped
before the big house and Uncle Jonah and Hortense got down The wide
door opened and there stood Grandmother in her white lace cap and
black silk dress as always
Hortense ran up the steps and kissed her Grandmother was little with
white hair and bright eyes They entered the oldfashioned hallway
together and Hortense knew at once that the house would be all that
she had hoped
The hall was dark and oldfashioned furniture sat along the walls A
spidery staircase with dark wood bannisters rose steeply from one side
and wound away out of sight At the far end of the hall was a great
friendly grandfathers clock with a broad round face
Ticktock ticktock said the clock in a deep mellow voice Hortense
thought he said Welcome welcome and was sure he winked at her
I must make him talk to me thought Hortense He seems a very wise
old clock How many interesting things he must know
A middleaged woman with a kind face came to meet them
Mary this is my little granddaughter said Grandmother and to
Hortense Mary will take care of you and show you your room When you
have taken your things off come downstairs and we will have tea
Hortense followed Mary up the steep winding stairs to the second
floor Mary opened one of the many doors of the long hallway and
Hortense followed her into a large oldfashioned room with a great
fourposter bed It was a corner room Through the windows on one side
Hortense could look out over the orchard slope that ran down to the
brook Beyond the brook rose a shadowy mountain whose side was so steep
that trees could hardly find a foothold among the rocks On the other
side of the room the windows opened upon the lawn bordered by a hedge
Beyond the hedge was the little house in front of which Hortense had
seen the boy but he was no longer playing in the yard
A big man carried up Hortenses trunk and placed it in the corner He
had bright blue eyes Mary introduced him to Hortense
This is my husband Fergus said she We live in the little house
beyond the orchard You must come to see us sometime and have tea My
husband will tell you stories of the Little People
The Little People are fairies arent they who live in Ireland said
Hortense remembering her fairy tales
Not only in Ireland said Fergus but everywhere in woods and
mountains Do you see that dark place in the rocks halfway up the
mountain
Hortense looked as directed and thought she saw the place
Thats the mouth of a cave that goes into the mountain nobody knows
how far said Fergus It is certain that the Little People must live
in there
His eyes twinkled but his face was quite serious
Really Hortense asked
Ive not seen them said Fergus but my eyes are older than yours I
do not doubt that you will see them dancing on moonlight nights
Meanwhile Mary had been unpacking the trunk and laying Hortenses
things away in the drawers of a great bureau
Now we will go down and have tea said Mary Let me brush your hair
a bit
After this was done they went downstairs again passed the big clock
that winked and said Ticktock hello and entered a sunny room
where Grandmother sat in her easy chair

CHAPTER II
And the darker the room grew the more it seemed alive
In Grandmothers room there were tall south windows reaching nearly to
the ceiling It must have been bright with sunshine in midday but it
was nearly evening now and the lower halves of the windows were closed
with white shutters which gave the room a very cosy appearance In the
white marble fireplace a cheerful fire was burning and above it on the
mantel was a large stuffed owl as white as the marble on which he was
perched He seemed quite alive and very wise his great yellow eyes
shining in the firelight Hortense glanced at him now and then and
always his bright eyes seemed fixed upon her
I believe he could talk if he would thought Hortense Sometime when
were alone Ill ask him if he cant
Now if youll call your grandfather well have tea said
Grandmother Hes in his library in the next room
Hortense ran to do as she was told The library was walled with books
thousands of them and near a window Grandfather sat at a big desk
busily writing He looked up when Hortense entered and laid down his
pen to take her on his knee
Grandfather had white hair and bushy white eyebrows over piercing dark
eyes Hortense had always thought him very handsome particularly when
he walked for he was tall and very straight She thought he must look
like a Sultan or Indian Rajah such as is told of in the Arabian
Nights for his skin was dark and when he told her stories of his
youth and his wanderings about the earth she wondered if he werent
really some foreign prince merely pretending to be her grandfather He
had been in many strange places in India Africa and the South Seas
and when he chose he could tell wonderful stories of his adventures
While Grandfather held her on his lap Hortense gazed at a strange
bronze figure which stood on a stone pedestal beside his desk It was a
bronze image such as Hortense had seen pictured in bookssome sort of
an idol she thought The figure sat crosslegged like a tailor and in
one hand held what seemed to be a bronze water lily Hortense had never
seen an image or statue that seemed so calm as though thinking deep
thoughts which it would never trouble to express
What a funny little man said Hortense
Grandfather looked gravely at the bronze figure
That is an image of Buddha the Indian god he said Perhaps after
dinner Ill tell you a story about him
He lifted Hortense from his knee and taking her by the hand went into
Grandmothers room
Mary had brought in the tea wagon which Hortense thought looked like a
dwarf Indeed all the furniture seemed curiously alive as though it
could talk if it would In the corner was a lowboy With the firelight
falling on its polished surface and on the bright brass handles to its
drawers it seemed to make a fat smiling face as of a goodhumored
boy
What a jolly face Hortense thought Hed be good fun to play with
Im sure
She ate her toast and cake while Grandfather and Grandmother talked
together in the twilight And the darker the room grew the more it
seemed alive
I believe all these things are talking said Hortense to herself
Now if I could only hear Perhaps if I had an ear trumpet or
something
As she was thinking thus a great tortoiseshell cat walked calmly in
seated himself on the hearthrug and stared into the fire It seemed
to Hortense that the flredogs fairly leaped out at him but the cat
only gazed placidly at them
He knows they cant get at him thought Hortense and hes saying
something to make them mad
Grandfather and Grandmother were talking in a low tone and Hortense
suddenly found herself listening to them with interest
Uncle Jonah says its a hant Grandfather was saying with a smile
He and Esmerelda are afraid and want me to fix up the rooms over the
stable
What nonsense Grandmother exclaimed sharply
But there is something odd about the house you know said
Grandfather
I believe that you think its a ghost yourself Keith said
Grandmother looking keenly at him
Ive always wanted to see a ghost admitted Grandfather but Ive
had no luck Why shouldnt there be ghosts All simple peoples believe
in them
Remember Hortense Grandmother said in a low voice
To be sure Grandfather answered looking quickly at Hortense
Hortense heard with all her ears but her eyes were upon the cat The
cat sat with a smile on his face and one ear cocked Once he looked at
Grandfather and laughed noiselessly
The cat understands every word Hortense said to herself with
conviction She began to be a little afraid of the cat for she felt
that everything in the room disliked him The lowboy no longer smiled
but looked rather solemn and foolish The chairs stood stiffly as
though offended at his presence The white owl glared fiercely with his
yellow eyes and the firedogs fairly snapped their teeth
But the cat did not mind He lay on the hearthrug and grinned at them
all Then he rolled over on his back waved his paws in the air and
whipped his long tail
Hes laughing at them said Hortense to herself And he knows all
about the hant whatever that is
Mary came to remove the tea wagon which Hortense decided was really
good at heart but surly and tart of temper because of his deformity
The brass teakettle looked to be goodtempered but unreliable
Theres something catlike about a teakettle Hortense reflected It
likes to sit in a warm place and purr And it likes any one who will
give it what it wants Its love is cupboard love
Dinner isnt until seven said Grandmother so perhaps youd like to
go to the kitchen and see Esmerelda the cook Uncle Jonahs wife If
you are nice to her it will mean cookies and all sorts of good
things
Hortense thought If Im nice to Esmerelda just to get cookies Ill
be no better than the cat and the teakettle so I hope I can like her
for herself Nevertheless it would be nice to have cookies too
Isnt this an awfully big house said Hortense to Mary as they went
down a long dark passage
Much too big said Mary I spend my days cleaning rooms that are
never used Theres the whole third floor of bedrooms not one of which
has been slept in for years Then there are the parlors and many
closets full of things that have to be aired and sunned and kept from
moths
May I go with you Mary when you clean Hortense asked Ill help
if I can
Sure you may said Mary kindly Ill be glad to have you Youll be
company Some of those dark closets and the bedrooms with sheeted
chairs and things give me the creeps An old house and old unused rooms
are eerielike Sometimes I can almost hear whispers and sighs and
things talking
I know said Hortense Everything talkschairs and tables and
bureaus and everything Only I can never hear just what it is they
say Do you think they move sometimes at night
Ill never look to see said Mary piously At night I stay in my own
little house where everything is quiet and homelike and there are no
queer things about
Hortense shivered delightfully Perhaps she would see and hear the
queer things and even see the hant of which Grandfather had spoken
The kitchen was a large comfortable place A bright fire was burning in
the range Shining pans hung on the wall and Aunt Esmerelda large
fat and friendly with a white handkerchief tied over her head moved
slowly among them
Aunt Esmerelda put her hands on her hips and looked down at Hortense
Yos the spittin image of yo ma honey said Aunt Esmerelda Does
yo like ginger cookies
Illustration Yos the spittin image of yo ma honey said Aunt
Esmerelda
Hortense doted on ginger cookies
Des de jar said Aunt Esmerelda pointing to a big crock on the
pantry shelf Whenevah yos hongry jes yo hep yosef
Hortense sat on a chair in the corner out of the way and watched Aunt
Esmerelda cook
What was the thing you and Uncle Jonah heard she asked at last
abruptly
Whas dat Aunt Esmerelda said dropping a saucepan with a clatter
Who tole you bout dat
I heard Grandpa talking to Grandma about it said Hortense
It want nothin said Esmerelda uneasily Don yo go citin
yosef bout dat Jes foolishness
But if there is a hant in the house I want to see it Hortense
persisted
Aunt Esmerelda stared at her with big eyes
Who all said anythin bout dis yere hant I aint never heard of no
hant
When you hear it again please wake me up if Im asleep said
Hortense
Heavens I don get outa mah bed wen I hears nothin said Aunt
Esmerelda Not by no means En if yo hears anythin jes yo shut
yo eahs and pull the kivers ovah yo head Den dey don git yo
But Hortense felt quite brave by the bright kitchen fire She sat very
quietly and watched Aunt Esmerelda at work The kitchen was filled with
bright friendly thingsshining pans and spoons a squat fat milk jug
with a smiling face a rolling pin that looked very stupid an egg
beater that surely must get as dizzy as a whirling dervish turning
round and round very fastprobably quite a scatterbrain Hortense
thought
What is that Aunt Esmerelda Hortense asked pointing to a bright
rounded utensil hanging above the kitchen table
Aunt Esmerelda looked
Dats a grater chile I grates cheese an potatoes an cabbage an
things wid dat
She took down the grater
On dis side it grates things small and on dis side big
She hung it in its place again
It looks wicked to me said Hortense I shouldnt like to meet it
wandering around the house at night
Laws chile how yo talks Aunt Esmerelda exclaimed startled Yo
gives me de fidgets Wheh yo git ideas like dat
Things look that way said Hortense Some look friendly and some
unfriendly Theres the cat and the teakettle They arent friendly
They say all sorts of sly things Sometime Im going to hear what they
are The grater would run after you and scrape you on his sharp sides
if he could
Aunt Esmerelda shook her head uneasily From time to time she stared at
Hortense
Yos a curyus chile she muttered I don know what yo ma means
abringin yo up disaway scaihin po ole Aunt Esmerelda Lans
sakes if I aint done forgit de pertatahs An deys all in de
stohroom
Wheres that Hortense asked much interested
In de basement said Aunt Esmerelda an its powahful dark down
deh
Ill go with you said Hortense eagerly Id like to see it
Aunt Esmerelda lighted a candle and taking a large pan opened the
door leading to the basement
It was a large basement and the candle was not sufficient to light its
more remote corners They passed a huge dark furnace with its arms
stretching out on all sides like a spiders legs In front of it was a
coal bin large and black
Aunt Esmerelda opened the door of the storeroom Within were barrels
and boxes and hanging shelves laden with row upon row of preserves in
jars and regiments of jelly glasses each with its paper top and its
white label
Aunt Esmerelda filled her pan with potatoes from the barrel and led the
way from the storeroom Closing the door she led the way back
upstairs
A sudden noise of something falling and of little scurrying feet led
her to stop abruptly Hortense drew close to her Aunt Esmerelda was
shaking and by the light of the candle Hortense could see the whites
of her eyes gleaming as she looked all about her
They started again for the cellar stairs When they had reached the
furnace a sudden gust of wind blew out the candle In a far corner of
the cellar something rattled
Aunt Esmerelda started to run and Hortense ran after her A faint
light from the kitchen shone on the head of the cellar stairs Aunt
Esmerelda hurried up the stairs panting with Hortense at her heels
At the top Aunt Esmerelda slammed and bolted the door then she sank
into a chair and mopped her perspiring face
Do you think it was the hant Hortense asked much excited
Don speak to me bout no hant exclaimed Aunt Esmerelda angrily
Yo sho scaihs me Run along and git ready fo dinnah
Though Hortense lingered Aunt Esmerelda would not say another word
and finally Hortense went to change her dress
CHAPTER III
They could hear the soft patpat of padded feet in the hall
Dinner was served in the large dining room Friendly clusters of
candles stood on the round mahogany table and made little pools of
light on its bright surface Mary waited on them
I wonder whats the matter with Aunt Esmerelda tonight said Grandpa
after the soup These potatoes arent done and the roast is burned
I think she was frightened at something in the cellar said Hortense
Whats that Grandpa questioned and Hortense told him of the noise
and the candle going out
A rat probably said Grandpa Werent you frightened
A little Hortense replied truthfully but I think it was because
Aunt Esmerelda was so afraid
Grandpa looked at her smiling under his bushy eyebrows
Would you go down to the storeroom and get me an apple if I gave you
something nice for your own he asked
Dont Keith said Grandma sharply Youll frighten the child
I dont want her to be afraid in the dark said Grandpa This is a
big house and much of it is dark
Hortense was silent thinking
Ill go she said
Good said Grandpa Bring me a plateful of northern spies
Hortense arose from the table and walked to the door As she went out
she heard Grandmother say Youll frighten the child The rest she
didnt hear
In the kitchen Hortense found Aunt Esmerelda seated in her chair
gazing gloomily at the kitchen range
May I have a candle Aunt Esmerelda Hortense asked
What fo yo wants a candle Aunt Esmerelda demanded
Im going to the storeroom to get Grandpa some apples said Hortense
Aunt Esmerelda stared at her without speaking for some moments
All by yosef she demanded at last
All by myself said Hortense
Aunt Esmerelda shook her head and muttered but rising found a candle
and lighted it
Ef yo say yo prayahs mebbe nothinll git yo she said ominously
It was black as a hat in the basement and little shivers ran up and
down Hortenses spine but she ran quickly to the storeroom and filled
her plate with apples from the big barrel
Starting back she heard a noise and stopped her heart pounding and
little pin pricks crinkling her scalp then she hurried to the stairs
almost running But she did not run up the stairs for she didnt wish
to have Aunt Esmerelda think her afraid
She was a glad little girl nevertheless when she was safe again in
the light kitchen
Yo didn see nothin demanded Aunt Esmerelda
I didnt see anything said Hortense I heard something but it was
probably only a rat She spoke bravely quite like Grandfather
Twant no rat muttered Aunt Esmerelda gloomily shaking her head
Its a hant or a ghos Deys hants and ghoss all roun dis place
Hortense began to feel quite brave after she had arrived safely in the
cheerful dining room Grandfather looked at her shrewdly smiling
Did you see or hear anything he asked
I hearda noise replied Hortense
And were you afraid he asked again
Hortense looked into his bright kind eyes
A little she confessed
Grandfather took her on his knee
It isnt being afraid that matters he said Its doing what you set
out to do whether afraid or not Thats what it is to be brave
Really Hortense asked
