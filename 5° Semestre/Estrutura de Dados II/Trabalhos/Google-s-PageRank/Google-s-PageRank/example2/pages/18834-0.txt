CHAPTER I
Grim Fate was tender contemplating you
And fairies brought their offerings at your birth
You take the roseleaf pathway as your due
Your rightful meed the choicest gifts of earth
ARTHUR C LEGGE
Fay stood on her balcony and looked over the ilexes of her villa at
Frascati out across the greygreen of the Campagna to the little
compressed city which goes by the great name of Rome
How small it looked what a huddled speck with a bubble dome to be
represented by so stupendous a name
She gazed at it without seeing it Her eyes turned towards it
mechanically because it contained somewhere within its narrow precincts
the man of whom she was thinking of whom she was always thinking
It was easy to see that Faythe Duchess of Colle Altowas an
Englishwoman in spite of her historic Italian name
She had the look of perfect though not robust health the reflection
over her whole being of a childhood spent much in the open air She was
twentythree but her sweet fair face with its delicate irregular
features was immature childish It gave no impression of experience
or thought or of having met life She was obviously not of those who
criticise or judge themselves In how many faces we see the conflict or
the remains of conflict with a dual nature Fay as she was called by
her family seemed all of a piece with herself Her unharassed
countenance showed it especially when as at this moment she looked
harassed Anxiety was evidently a foreign element It sat ill upon her
smooth face as if it might slide off at any moment Fays violet eyes
were her greatest charm She looked at you with a deprecating timid
limpid gaze in which no guile existed any more than steadfastness any
more than unselfishness any more than courage
Fay had come into the world anxious to please She had never shown any
particular wish to give pleasure If she had been missed out of her
somewhat oppressed and struggling home when she married it is probable
that the sense of her absence was tinged by relief
She had never intended to marry the Duke of Colle Alto It is difficult
to say why that sedate distinguished personage married her
Fays face had a very sweet and endearing promise in it which drew mens
eyes after her I dont know what it meant and they did not know
either but they instinctively lessened the distance between themselves
and it A very thin string will tow a very heavy body if there is no
resistance and the pace is slow The duke looked at Fay who was at
that moment being taken out for her first season by her grandmother
Lady Bellairs Fay tried to please him as was her wont with all except
men with beards She liked to have him in attendance Her violet eyes
lighted up with genuine pleasure when he came to see her
It is perhaps difficult for the legions of women who do not please
easily and for the handful whose interests lie outside themselves and
who are not desirous of pleasing indiscriminately it is difficult for
either to realise the passionate desire to please which possesses and
saps the life of some of their sisters Admiration with them is not a
luxury any more than a hotwater bottle is a luxury to the aged or a
foot rest to a gouty foot It is a necessity of life After a becoming
interval the interstices of which had been filled with flowers the
duke proposed to Lady Bellairs for Fays hand Fay did not wish to marry
him He was not in the least her ideal Neither did she wish to remain
unmarried neither did she wish to part with her grave distinguished
suitor who was an ornament to herself And she was distinctly averse to
living any longer in the paternal home lost in a remote crease in a
Hampshire down Poor women have only too frequently to deal with these
complicated situations with which blundering egotistic male minds are
seldom in perfect sympathy
Fay had never willingly relinquished any of the men who had cared for
her and some had cared much These last had as a rule torn themselves
away from her leaving hearts or other fragments of themselves behind
and were not to be cajoled back again even by one of her little
giltedged notes But the duke did not break away He had selected her
she pleased him he desired to marry an Englishwoman He had the
approval of Lady Bellairs
The day came when Fay was suddenly and adroitly confronted with the fact
that she must marry him or lose him
Many confirmed bachelors who openly regret that they have never come
across a woman to whom they cared to tie themselves for life might be
in a position to descant on the inability of wives to enter into their
husbands inmost feelings if only theythe bachelorshad known on a
past occasion how to act with sudden promptitude on the top of patience
The duke played the waiting game and then hit hard He had coolly
allowed himself to be trifled with until the moment arrived when it did
not suit him to be trifled with any longer
The marriage had not proved a marked success nor an entire failure The
duke was an irreproachable husband but like many men who marry when
they are no longer young he aged suddenly after marriage He quickly
became bald and stout His tact except in these two particulars remained
flawless He never allowed his deep chagrin to appear when three years
after his marriage he still remained without a son to continue his
historic name
He was polite to his wife at all times mildly sarcastic as to her
extravagance Fay was not exorbitantly extravagant but then the duke
was not exorbitantly rich One of Fays arts as unconscious as that of
a kitten was to imply past unhappiness spoken of with a cheerful
resignation which greatly endeared her to othersand to herself The
duke had understood that she had not had a very happy home and he had
honestly endeavoured to make her new home happy In the early days of
his marriage he made many small experiments in the hope of pleasing the
pretty creature who had thrown in her lot with his Possibly also there
may have been other subtle patient attempts to win somewhat from her of
another nature Possibly there may have been veiled disappointments
and noiseless retreats under cover of night
However these things may have been after the first year Fay made the
discovery that she was unhappily married The duke was kind in kindness
he never failed but he was easily jealousat least she thought so and
he appeared quite unable to see in their true light her amicable little
flirtations with his delightful compatriots After one or two annoying
incidents in which the compatriots had shown several distinctly
unEnglish characteristics the duke became in his wifes eyes
tiresome strict a burden Perhaps also she felt the Englishwomans
surprise at the inadequate belief in a womans power of guarding her own
virtue which remains in some nations an hereditary masculine instinct
She felt that she could take care of herself which was in reality
just what she could not do as her imperturbable watchful husband was
well aware
But was he aware of the subject of her thoughts at this moment It was
more than probable that he was But Fay had not the faintest suspicion
that he had guessed anything
One of her many charms was a certain youthful innocence of mind which
imputed no evil to others which never suspected that others would
impute it to her Her husband was wearisome He looked coldly on her if
she smiled on young men and she had to smile at them when they smiled
at her But she reasoned of course all the time he really knew that he
could trust her entirely There was no harm in Fays nature no venom
there were no dark places no strong passions with their awful
possibilities for good and evil She had already given much pain in her
short life but inadvertently She was of that large class of whom it
may truly be said when evil comes that they are more sinned against
than sinning They always somehow gravitate into the places where people
are sinned against just as some people never attend a cricketmatch
without receiving a ball on their persons
And now trouble had come upon her She had at last fallen in love I
would not venture to assert that she had fallen in very deep that the
breakers of the boundless deep had engulfed her Some of us make
shipwreck in a teacup tempest and when our serenity is restoredthere
is nothing calmer than a teacup after its stormour experience serves
after a decent interval as an agreeable fringe to our confidential
conversation
Anyhow Fay had fallen in love I feel bound to add that for some time
before that event happened life had become intolerably dull The advent
to Rome of her distant connection Michael Carstairs had been at this
juncture a source of delight to her She had before her marriage
flirted with him a very littlenot as much as she could have wished
but Lady Bellairs who was fond of him had promptly intervened and the
young man had disappeared into his examinations That was four years
ago
In reality Fay had halfforgotten him but when she saw him suddenly
pale handsome distinguished across a ballroom in Rome and after a
moments uncertainty realised who he was she felt the same pleasurable
surprise soft as the fall of dew which pervades the feminine heart
when in looking into an unused drawer it inadvertently haps upon a
length of new ribbon bought carefully put away and forgotten
Fay went gently up to Michael conscious of her beauty and her wonderful
jewels and held out her hand with a little deprecating smile
And so we meet again at last she said
He turned red and white
At last he said with difficulty
She looked more closely at him The dreamy poetic face had changed
during those four years She became dimly aware that he had not only
grown from a youth into a man but that some other transformation had
been painfully wrought in him
Instinctively her beaming face became grave to match his She was slow
to see what others were feeling but quick to reflect their mood She
sighed gently vaguely stirred in spite of herself by somethingshe
knew not whatin her companions face
It is four years since I saw you she said
And from her lowered voice it seemed as if her life were rooted in
memory alone
Four years said Michael who promising young diplomat as he was
appeared only able to repeat parrotwise her last words after her
A pause
Do you know my husband
I do not
May I introduce him to you
Fay made a little sign and the duke approached superb decorated
dignified with the polished pallor as if the skin were a little too
tight which is the Charybdis of many who have avoided the Scylla of
wrinkles
The elder Italian and the grave fair young Englishman bowed to each
other were made known to each other
That night as the duke drove home with his wife he said to her in his
admirable English
Your young cousin is an enthusiast a dreamer a sensitive what your
Tennyson calls a Sir Galahad In Italy we make of such men a priest a
cardinal He is not an homme daffaires It was not well to put him
into diplomacy One may make a religion of art One may even for a time
make a religion of a woman But of the English diplomacy one does not
make a religion
Fay lay awake that night From a disused pigeonhole in her mind she
drew out and unfolded to its short length that attractive remnant that
halfforgotten episode of her teens She remembered everythingI mean
everything she wished to remember Michaels face had recalled it all
those exquisite days which he had taken so much more seriously than she
had the sudden ruthless intervention of Lady Bellairs the end of the
daydream Fay whose attention had been adroitly diverted to other
channels had never wondered how he took their separation at the time
Now that she saw him again she was aware that he had taken itto heart
During that sleepless night Fay persuaded herself that Michael had not
been alone in his suffering She also had felt the parting with equal
poignancy
They met again a few days later by chance in an old cloistered deserted
garden How often she had walked in that garden as she was doing now
with English friends His presence gave the place its true significance
They met as those who have between them the bond of a common sorrow
And what have you been doing all these four years she asked him as
they wandered somewhat apart
I have been working
You never came to say goodbye before you went to that place in Germany
to study
I was told I had better not come
I suppose grandmamma told you that
She did most kindly and wisely
A pause
She was leaning in the still May sunshine against an old grey tomb of
carved stone Two angels with spread wings upheld the defaced
inscription Above it over it round it like desire impotently defying
death a flood of red roses clambered and clung Were they trying to
wake some votary who slept below A great twisted sentinel cypress kept
its own dark counsel Against its shadow Fays figure in her white
gossamer gown showed more ethereal and exquisite even than in memory
She seemed at one with this wonderful passionate southern spring which
trembled between rapture and anguish The red roses and the white irises
were everywhere Even the unkept grass in which her light feet were set
was wild with white daisies
Do you remember our last walk on the down that day in spring she said
suddenly
She had forgotten it until last night
I remember it
It was May then It is May again now
He did not answer The roses left off calling to the dead and suddenly
enfolded the two young grave creatures leaning against the tomb in a
gust of hot perfume
Do you remember Fays voice was tremulous how you gave me a bit of
pink may
I remember
I was looking at it yesterday It is not very pink now
It was true In all shallow meanings and when she had not had time to
get her mind into a tangle Fay was perfectly truthful She had
yesterday been turning over the contents of a little cedar box in which
she kept her childish possessions and she had found in an envelope a
brown unsightly ghost of what had once been a mayblossom on a Hampshire
down She had remembered the vivid sunshine the wheeling seagull the
soft south wind blowing in from the sea Michael had kissed her under
the thin dappled shade of the flowering tree and she had kissed him
back
Michaels eyes turned for a long moment to the yellow weatherstained
arches of the cloister and then he looked full at Fay with a certain
peculiar detached glance which had first made her endeavour to attract
him There is a look in a mans face which women like Fay cannot endure
because it means independence of them
I thought he said with the grave simplicity which apparently was
unchangeable in him whatever else might change that it was only I who
remembered It has always been a comfort to me that any unhappiness
which my want of forethought mymy culpable selfishness may have
caused was borne by myself alone
I was unhappy too she said speaking as simply as he She looked up
at him suddenly as she said it There was a wet glint in her deep violet
eyes She believed absolutely at that moment that she had been as
unhappy as he for four years There was no suspicion in her mind that
she was not genuine Only the sincere ever doubt their sincerity Fay
never doubted hers She felt what she said and the sweet eyes turned on
Michael had the transparent fixity of a childs
They walked unsteadily back to the others and spoke no more to each
other that day Conscience pricked Fay that night
Leave him alone it said You have both suffered Let the dead past
bury its dead
Fays conscience was a wonderfully adaptable one with a tendency to
poetic quotation It showed considerable tact in adopting her point of
view Nevertheless from that generally fallacious standpoint it often
gave her quite respectable advice Leave him alone said the
hoodwinked monitor You are married and Andrea is easily jealous
Michael is sensitive and has been deeply in love with you Dont stir
him up to fall in love with you again Leave him alone
The young British matron waxed indignant Was she Fay the kind of
woman to forget her duty to her husband Was Michael the kind of man to
make love to a married woman Such an idea was preposterous unjust to
both of them And people would begin to talk at once if she and her
cousin Michael was only a distant connection were studiously to avoid
each other if they could not exchange a few words simply like old
friends No one had suggested an attitude of rigid avoidance but
throughout life Fay had always convinced herself of the advisability of
a certain wishedfor course by conjuring up only to discard it the
extreme and most obviously senseless opposite of that courseas the
only alternative
She imagined her husband saying Why wont you ask Mr Carstairs to
dinner He is your cousin and he is charming What can the reason be
that you so earnestly refuse to meet him And then Andrea who always
got ideas into his head would begin to suspect that there had been
something between them
No No It would be far wiser to meet naturally now and then and to
treat Michael like an old friend Fay had a somewhat muffled conception
of what an old friend might be After deep thought she came to the
conclusion that it was her duty to ask Michael frequently to the house
When Fay once recognised a duty she performed it without delay
She met with an unexpected obstacle in the way of its adequate
performance The obstacle was Michael
The young man came once and then again after an interval of several
months but apparently nothing would induce him to frequent the house
Fay did not recognise her boyish eager lover in the grave sedate man
old of his age who had replaced him His dignified and quite
unobtrusive resistance which had not indifference at its core added an
intense a feverish interest to Fays life She saw that he still cared
for her and that he did not intend to wound himself a second time He
had had enough She put out all her little transparent arts during the
months that followed The duke watched
She had implied to her husband with a smile that she had not been very
happy at home She implied to Michael with a smile that it was not the
dukes fault but that she was not very happy in her married life that
he did not care much about her and that they had but few tastes in
common Each lived their own life on amicable terms but somewhat apart
from each other She owned that she had hoped for something rather
different in marriage She had it seemed started life with a very
exalted ideal of married life which the dukes
coarse thumb
And finger failed to plumb
Michael remained outwardly obdurate but inwardly he weakened His
tender adoration and respect for Fay wounded and mutilated though they
had been had nevertheless survived what in many minds must have proved
their deathblow He still believed implicitly all she said
But to him her marriage was the impassable barrier a barrier as
enfranchisable as the brown earth on a coffin lid
After many months Fay at last vaguely realised his attitude towards her
She told herself that she respected it that it was just what she
wished was in fact the result of her own tactfully expressed wishes
She seemed to remember things she had said which would have led him to
behave just as he had done And then she turned heaven and earth to
regain her personal ascendency over him She never would have regained
it if an accident had not befallen her She fell in love with him during
the process
The day came an evil day for Michael when he could no longer doubt it
when he was not permitted to remain in doubt Who shall say what waves
of boundless devotion what passionate impulses of protection of
compassion of intense longing to shield her from the fire which had
devastated his own youth passed in succession over him as he looked at
the delicate little creature who was to him the only real woman in the
worldall the rest were counterfeitsand who now as he believed
loved him as he had long loved her
Michael was one of the few men who bear through life the common
masculine burden of a profound ignorance of women coupled with an
undeviating loyalty towards them He supposed she was suffering as he
had suffered that it was with her now beside the fountain under the
ilexes of her Italian garden as it had been with him during these five
intolerable years
How Fay wept What a passion of tears till her small flowerlike face
was bereft of all beauty of everything except a hideous contraction of
grief
He stood near her not touching her in anguish far deeper than hers At
last he took her clenched hand in his
Do not grieve so he said brokenly It is not our fault It is
greater than either of us It has come upon us against our wills We
have both struggled You dont know how I have struggled Fay day and
night since I came to Rome But I have been in fault I ought never to
have come for I knew you were living near Rome But I did not know it
had touched you and for myself I had hopedI thoughtthat it was
pastin as far as it could passthat I was accustomed to it Listen
Fay and do not cry so bitterly I will leave Rome at once I will not
see you again My poor darling we have come to a hard place in life
but we can do the only thing left to usour duty
Fays heart contracted and she suddenly ceased sobbing She had never
thought of this horrible possibility that he would leave her
She drew the hand that clasped hers to her lips and held it tightly
against her breast
Dont leave me she stammered trembling from head to foot from sheer
terror at the thought I will be good I will do what is right We are
not like other people We can trust each other But I cant live without
seeing you sometimes I could not bear it
He withdrew his hand They looked wildly into each others eyes His
convulsed face paled and paled Even as he stood before her she knew she
was losing him that something was tearing him from her It was as
certain that he was going from her as if she were standing by his
deathbed
He kissed her suddenly
I shall not come back he said And the next moment he was gone
CHAPTER II
Nous passons notre vie A  nous forger des chaAnes et A
nous plaindre de les porterVALTOUR
For a long time Fay had stood on her balcony looking out towards Rome
while the remembrance of the last few months pressed in upon her
It was a week since she had seen Michael since he had said I shall
not come back
And in the meanwhile she had heard that he had resigned his appointment
and was leaving Rome at once She had never imagined that he would act
so quickly with such determination She had vaguely supposed that he
would send in his resignation and then remain on In novels in a
situation like theirs the man never really went away or if he did he
came back Fay knew very little of Michael but nevertheless she
instinctively felt and quailed before the conviction that he really was
leaving her for ever that he would reconstruct a life for himself
somewhere in which she could not reach him in which she would have no
part or lot He might suffer during the process but he would do it His
yea was yea and his nay nay She should see him no more Some day not
for a long time perhaps but some day she should hear of his marriage
Suddenly without a moments warning her own life rose up before her
distorted horrible unendurable The ilexes solemn in the sunset
showed like foul shapes of disgust and nausea The quiet Campagna with
its distant faintly outlined Sabine hills was rotten to the core
The duke passed across a glade at a little distance and looking up
smiled gravely at her with a slight courteous gesture of his brown
hand
She smiled mechanically in response and shrank back into her room Her
husband had suddenly become a thing to shudder at repulsive as a
reptile intolerable Her life with him without Michael stretched
before her like a loathsome disease a leprosy which in the
interminable years would gradually eat her away a death by inches
The first throes of a frustrated passion at the stake have probably
seldom failed to engender a fierce rebellion against the laws which
light the faggots round it
The fire had licked Fay She fled blindfold from it not knowing
whither only away from that pain over any precipice into any slough
I cannot live without him she sobbed to herself This is not just a
common love affair like other peoples It is everything my whole life
It is not as if we were bad people We are both upright We always have
been We have both done our best butI cant go on What is reputation
worth the worlds opinion of menothing
It was not worth more to Fay at that moment than it has ever been worth
to any other poor mortal since the worlds opinion first clashed with
love
To follow love shows itself time and time again alike to the pure and to
the worldly as the only real life the only path But if we disbelieve
in it and framing our lives on other lines become voluntarily
bedridden into selfishness and luxury can wewhen that in which we
have not believed comes to passcan we suddenly rise and follow Love up
his mountain passes We try to rise when he calls us from our sick beds
We even go feverishly a little way with him But unless we have learnt
the beginnings of courage and selfsurrender before we set out we seem
to turn giddy and lose our footing Certain precipices there are where
only the pure and strong in heart may pass at the foot of which are the
piled bones of many passionate pilgrims
Were Fays delicate little bones so subtly covered in soft white flesh
to be added to that putrefying heap But can we blame anyone be they
who they may placed howsoever they may be who when first they undergo
a real emotion try however feebly to rise to meet it
Fay was not wholly wise not wholly sincere but she made an attempt to
meet it It was not to be expected that the attempt would be quite wise
or quite sincere either Still it was the best she could do She would
sacrifice herself for love She would go away with Michael No one would
ever speak to her again but she did not care
Involuntarily she unclasped a diamond SaintEsprit from her throat which
the duke had given her and laid it on her writingtable She should
never wear it again She no longer had the right to wear it It was a
unique jewel But what did she care for jewels now They had served to
pass the time in the sort of waking dream in which she had lived till
Michael came But she was awake now She looked at herself in the glass
long and fixedly Yes she was beautiful How dreadful it must be for
plain women when they loved They must know that men could not really
care for them They might of course respect and esteem them and wish
in a lukewarm way to marry them but they could never really love them
She Fay carried with her the talisman
A horrible doubt seized her just when she was becoming calm Supposing
Michael would not Oh but he would if he cared as she did The
sacrifice was all on the womans side No one thought much the worse of
men when they did these things And Michael was so good so honourable
that he would certainly never desert her They would become legal
husband and wife directly Andrea divorced her
From underneath these matted commonplaces Fays muffled conscience
strove to reach her with its weak voice
Stop stop it said You will injure him You will tie a noose round
his neck You will spoil his life And Andrea He has been kind in a
way And your marriage vows And your own people at home And Magdalen
the sister who loves you Remember her Stop stop Let Michael go You
were obliged to relinquish him once Let him go again now
Fay believed she went through a second conflict Perhaps there lurked at
the back of her mind the image of Michaels set faceset away from her
and that image helped her at last to say to herself Yes It is right
I will let him go
But did she really mean it For while she said over and over again
Yes yes we must part she decided that it was necessary to see him
just once again to bid him a last farewell to strengthen him to live
without her She could not reason it out but she knew that it was
absolutely essential to the welfare of both that they should see each
other just once more before they partedfor ever The parting no
longer loomed so awful in her mind if there was to be a meeting before
it took place She almost forgot it directly her mind could find a
staying point on the thought of that one last sacred interview of all
she should say of all they would both feel
But how to see him He had said he would not come back He left Rome in
a few days She should see him officially on Thursday when he was in
attendance on his chief But what was the use of that He would hardly
exchange a word with her She might decide to see him alone but what
if he refused to see her Instinctively Fay knew that he would so
refuse
We must part Just so But how to hold him How to draw him to her
just once more That was the crux
In novels if a woman needs the help of the chivalrous man ever kneeling
in the background she sends him a ring Fay looked earnestly at her
rings But Michael might not understand if she sent him one and if the
duke intercepted it he would certainly entirely misconstrue the
situation
Fay sat down at her writingtable and got out her notepaper Truth
compels me to state that it was of blue linen that it had a little gilt
coronet on it and that it was scented
She thought a long time At least she bit the little silver owl at the
end of her pen for a long time She tore up several sheets At last she
wrote in her large slanting dashing handwriting
I know that we must part You are right and I wish it too It is
all like a terrible dream and what will the awakening be Fay
did not quite know what she meant by this but it impressed her
deeply as she wrote it and a tear dropped on the awakening and
made it look like reckoning She was not of those however who
having once written one word ever think it can be mistaken for
another and really reckoning did quite as well as awakening
