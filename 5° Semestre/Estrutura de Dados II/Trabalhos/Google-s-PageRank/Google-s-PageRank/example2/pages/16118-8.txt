THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY
VOL XLIII        MAY 1889          NO 5
American Missionary Association
FINANCIAL
THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY presents its greetings for the month of May Six
months of our fiscal year are now in the past The half year which we
anticipate includes the summer time when many of the friends of the
ignorant millions to whom we are sent are absent from their churches
The months of May and June ought to swell the stream of love and service
against the season when the demand will continue and income will be
small
We appealed last month for an increase of the contributions in church
collections We renew and emphasize that appeal for these collections
are the steady streams on which we rely to keep in motion the wheels of
the large and ever enlarging work of the Association We believe that
the interest in this great work is on the increase We rejoice that the
most prolific missionary field ever opened to any Christian people
right here at our doors is gaining upon the interest and benevolence
of the churches year by year Never were the friends of the cause mote
responsive never was the work more hopeful The work enlarges and the
peoples faith enlarges Their gifts to Christ for his poor were never
freer
We have been greatly favored with special gifts Every one of them is
needed It is a blessed thing that one can plant his benevolences in
some special institution or feature of work and know that the
influences are to follow on after the giver has gone to a higher world
But we do hope that the CHURCHES OF CHRIST AS CHURCHES will not fail
to keep step with the providences of God in their church contributions
It is also true that some fear that the day of LEGACIES is to come to an
end Indeed there are those who take a solemn comfort in bewailing and
fearing that everything is to come to an end They mix a pound of
forebodings with an ounce of faith If for some unseen reasons in the
movements of life and death legacies do not appear with the regularity
of insurance tables they think the day of legacies is dead
Nevertheless legacies will continue as long as Christians pass from
earth to heaven There will always be faithful souls who will remember
Christ and his cause in their wills There will always be those who may
not be able to divide their estates and to dispose of portions of them
while they live who will yet provide that they may see their works
following them when they shall look down from a world redeemed to a
world for whose redemption Christ lived and died There will always be
legacies and the American Missionary Association so long as it follows
in the steps of Christ in such mission as it has will not be forgotten
The legacies will come because they ought to come The people of God
will remember this work in their wills because they ought to do this
and God will take care that what Christian stewards ought to do shall
be done
We thank God for SPECIAL GIFTS We thank God for LEGACIES We also thank
God for the ability and faith and sacrifices of those who cannot plant
institutions or build or endow schools but who live and give that which
provides for the unceasing CURRENT EXPENSES Almost every one can do a
little more and it is the many littles that make the difference between
a debt with a crippled work and freedom from debt with healthful
growth All along the lines the calls for help are so urgent that it
is painful for us in the name of the church to be constantly saying
No

believe that they will
CENTENNIAL
These pages will come before our readers amid the enthusiastic
rejoicings of a great nation celebrating the one hundredth anniversary
of its Constitutiona Constitution that has been tried and found
worthy
The greatest strain to which this great charter has been subjected in
the past hundred years has been occasioned by slavery The crisis cost
untold blood and treasure The great strain of the next hundred years
will be what slavery has left behind ita vast and growing black
population and an imbittered race prejudice
There is but one way to meet this strain of the coming century and that
is by the education of the blacks The task is great but if the
American people will awake to its urgency and put forth the needed
effort the crisis may be averted We call upon all Christian people
and upon all patriots to begin this new century with the purpose to
increase their contributions for this great object We ask them to begin
at once and to continue steadilyin church contributions in personal
gifts and not to forget the object in the making of wills
CONGREGATIONALISM IN GEORGIA
Our readers are aware that there are two Congregational Organizations in
the State of Georgia The Georgia Congregational Association was
organized in 1878 and is composed of about a dozen colored churches
some of their pastors being white and some colored The United
Congregational Conference of Georgia was formed a little more than a
year ago is a much larger body and is composed of white pastors and
churches With a view to a possible union of these two organizations
committees have been appointed by each and in another column we lay
before our readers the propositions to that end made by the Committee
of the Georgia Association We cannot withhold our expression of
satisfaction with the Christian spirit exhibited in this document and
the readiness to accept any possible alternative to secure the union
The Congregational Churches of the country will feel an interest in
marking the progress of these negotiations and will hail with delight a
consummation that will relieve the denomination from the embarrassment
of sanctioning two organizations in the same State that seem to be
separated only by the colorline
NOTES FROM THE SOUTH
BY SECRETARY AF BEARD
Once more in Nashville There is no question in my mind but that
Nashville is the educational leader in the South It is a city of hills
which are crowned with institutions for white and black These are the
beginnings of greater and better days for this part of our country My
duties have taken me to Fisk University It is a college which has
justly won very high praise Jubilee and Livingstone Halls are
significant names One speaks of an historic event and the other of an
historic person but the work that goes on in both these large buildings
does no dishonor to one name or the other
When Congressman Kelley of Pennsylvania was in Nashville he visited
Fisk University He afterwards told me that he could not conceal his
surprise at what he saw and heard and only with difficulty his emotion
when he arose to address the students
I have now visited Fisk several times I am each time more impressed
with the fidelity and quality of the work on the part of the students
and the patient enthusiasm of the professors and of the teachers If
there were to be no other or greater results than those of the past and
the present all that has been done for Fisk University would be
justified
From Nashville to Sparta Tenn and then a rough tough ride up the
mountain side rattling the bones over the stones until at length we
have climbed the Cumberland Plateau We arrive at nowhere in
particular which is named Pleasant Hill Here are a neat church which
is both church and school and a sightly building of two stories with a
third under the mansard roof which will accommodate forty boys A few
houses are visible from the top of this building but no one could guess
where forty mountain boys and as many girls might be living
Nevertheless they have been discovered and it was none too soon
Missionary Dodge did not locate in Pleasant Hill before the time He
realized this He looked about him and looked up and down He saw things
which were invisible He saw castles in the air It must be confessed
that the office at Reade Street fearing lest it might trust the
churches too much had not the faith which could take hold of these
castles in the air and anchor them to the soil of Pleasant Hill but
Brother Dodge got his grapples out and pulled down a church building
from the heavens Well done now surely he should rest from his labors
and give himself and us time to breathe No a visible church only
stimulated his faith it did not satisfy it This church was a place in
which he could read the eleventh chapter of Hebrews every Sunday The
result was the Hall for young men and for the teachers Now we are in
it and are glad The Massachusetts Principal gave us welcome the
Oberlin VicePrincipal endorsed it while the Matron materialized the
spirit of welcome in a way calculated to excite gratitude from the fact
that missionaries cannot live absolutely on faith
Next the young men were introduced One of them was seized with
undisguised curiosity to behold a minister whose theological system some
institution had found it necessary to doctor It is perhaps the first
instance on record in modern times where these semilunar fardels have
been looked upon with respect and curiosity When Brother Dodge came
congratulations were in order over his Church his School and his Hall
but he would have none of it He was seeing another building floating in
the clouds and could only talk of the invisible It will however soon
be among things visible for the missionary has his grapples out It is
to be a Boarding Hall and Industrial Home for girls who will come into
it and learn to live and to be But Pleasant Hill is not a town it is
not a village it is only by courtesy a hamlet Where are your pupils
The woods are full of them and they will come from near and from far
replies their young missionary of more than three score and ten years
On Sunday the church was filled on Monday the school was full and
our heart was full of thanksgiving that God had come to these mountain
people that hope would enter their lives and their cabins and that
these boys and girls would now step up in Christian manhood and
womanhood
One of the impressive thoughts which a visit to an institution like Fisk
University is sure to excite is the relation of all this work to the
future Apropos of this the Rev JOA Clark DD LLD of Macon
Ga has just written a little tract of fifty pages on The Future of
the Races He does not vote in New England nor is he a Yankee but he
is a good and true witness He says that the Races are running races
along the paths of knowledge and up the hills of science These are his
words pages 19 and 20 Have they the colored people availed
themselves of the educational facilities Have they profited by them We
answer that they have been incalculably benefited They have shown not
only that they can receive education but education of a high order
Their improvement has been so astonishing as to silence doubt and
caviling Our Southern eyes have been opened to see it Southern candor
is free to admit it There are none who do not admit it but the
hopelessly prejudiced I am persuaded that the average examinations in
the colored schools are better than the average in the white schools
for teachableness is the basis of all education and this universally
distinguishes the negro Dr Clark is not saying that the white boy may
not learn more easily and master more rapidly but rather is telling how
the hare came out second in the race with his competitor not so fleet of
foot but which had the gift of patient continuance in welldoing Still
he accentuates the fact that their improvement is astonishing I am
sure that no one can visit Fisk University without having all his doubts
dispersed as to the future of the negro race It is to have a future
This leads me to quote the closing words of Dr Clarks significant
pamphlet page 52 All Africa stretches out her hands to God to the
work of delivering her fatherland from heathenism God is calling the
blacks of these Southern States They are to be the chief instruments in
giving the Gospel of Christ to the benighted land of their fathers
Wherefore let the work of Christian and so sanctified education go
on
All this is true and it means that in our American Missionary
Association the ministerial education must now be made more prominent
When white missionaries can say as one whose bones are in the soil of
the Dark Continent did say Let a thousand fall before Africa shall be
given up the children of Africa must respond Africa shall be
evangelized by Africans That is we must have more and better
theological schools for the Negro people The demand for educated Negro
ministers who know what religion is and what purity is will be
greater and greater
The demand for missionaries of the negro race who can realize that
Christianity is a missionary religion will be greater also We can
scarcely expect that those who came out of Egypt will become
missionaries to Egypt The apprehension of missionary responsibility
comes with a developed Christianity The missionary sense came to the
Apostles themselves very slowly It came to the Christian Church slowly
The African people in America I trust will seize upon it more rapidly
for they have a large emotional nature and great faith What they now
need is education and intellectual character and those qualities which
give shape and tone and persistence to the forces which direct and
control events
Men who have been slaves may not take on this and their children may
not in great numbers But their childrens children are coming on
multitudinously and from them must go those who shall preach the Gospel
to their own race in Africa For psychological as well as physiological
reasons this must be Not only because they can live and whites cannot
in Africa but because other things being equal they can do this work
better with their own race Said Christ Go home to thy friends and
tell what great things the Lord hath done for thee
All of which says that the Fisk must now add to its great work a
thorough theological school and must urge its students to listen to the
voice of God and to answer when God calls Speak Lord thy servant
heareth More and better ministers are needed both for Africa in the
United States and Africa across the sea He will give wisely who will
give quickly for this
ILLUMINATED SPOTS
A Northern visitor in the South writing in a recent number of The
Advance speaks of the rapid improvement of the Negroes in that
locality He says that the Negro is prosperous that commercially he is
honest that one house has had no less than thirteen hundred names of
colored people on its books each having a credit from a few dollars to
forty or more that the Negro respects educationeven if he is unable
to read himself he wants with all the determination of his soul that
his children shall be educated that the merchants say that they are
buying better and better goods are learning the value of money are
exercising wiser judgment are becoming farmers and mechanics are
becoming better men
These items taken from a long article show the bright light glowing in
that locality Of course the writer gives some dark touches to the
picture and thus modified it may be repeated of thousands of places
throughout the South Some of our friends we fear look too much upon
the dark side There is a dark side and it is dense But if we can
only continue and enlarge the sphere of these bright spots and kindle
others in new localities the time will come when the light will
displace the darkness and the dawn of a new era will come Friends of
the Negro race patriots and Christians furnish the oil for these
bright spots and help to multiply them
THE GOVERNMENT AND THE INDIANS
On the 13th of March some of the Secretaries of the missionary
societies and others interested in the welfare of the Indians
had an interview with President Harrison and with Secretary
Noble of the Interior Department We were kindly received and
the Secretary solicited information from us as to the methods in
which he could aid in furtherance of Indian civilization A
number of suggestions were made in response and the following
outline is given as a summary of the points presented to the
Secretary
1 That the appointment or retention of all officers and employes in the
Indian service of the Government shall be on the sole ground of
fitnessthat ability integrity and an interest in the welfare of the
Indians shall constitute the only required conditions We are not
ignorant of the difficulties involved in securing such persons
especially with the low salaries paid to some of these employes and we
shall be abundantly satisfied with the purpose of the Government to
reach the nearest attainable success in this direction
2 That the Government shall make adequate appropriations for the
establishment and maintenance of suitable schools for the education of
all Indian pupilswhether these schools be sustained and controlled
wholly by the Government or in cooperation with missionary societies
The millions of dollars now due to the Indians by treaty stipulations
for educational purposes should not be idle in the National Treasury
but should as rapidly as possible be devoted to their legitimate
purposes and they should be supplemented as far as need be by direct
grants from the Government
3 That the cooperation of the Government with the missionary societies
in what are known as Contract schools should be continued and
enlarged We believe that no better teaching has been afforded to the
Indians than that given in these Contract schools The educational
qualifications of the teachers together with their disinterested and
selfdenying characters and their religious influence and instruction
render them preeminently fit for their places and successful in their
work The experience of the past and the testimony of all unprejudiced
persons bear witness to this fact
4 That compulsory education of Indian pupils be enforced with liberty
of choice to the parents in the selection of the schools to which their
children shall be sent The Indians are generally averse or
indifferent to the education of their children The withholding of
rations in case of failure or neglect is usually an allsufficient
motive for prompt compliance Then too the parent if a Christian and
intelligent should be allowed to select the school for his child and
not be compelled to send it to a Government school simply because that
may happen to be nearest
5 The Government should adopt a liberal policy in regard to the use of
the vernacular in the Indian schools We are all agreed that the English
language should be brought into use among the Indians at the earliest
practicable period But the experience of all the past in Indian
civilization among the ruder tribes has shown that Christian influences
have been most successfully brought to bear by the use of the
vernacular in giving them the knowledge of the Word of God in teaching
them a practical morality and in preparing them for civilized life We
ask therefore that no restrictions be placed upon Christian people in
their efforts for this great object
6 We ask that the Government exercise an absolute impartiality in
dealing with the different denominations of Christians in the
distribution of appropriations in the granting of lands for missionary
uses and in the appointment of officers agents teachers and employes
We ask no favors in these respects and we desire that none shall be
granted to others
NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND
BY REV CJ RYDER DISTRICT SECRETARY
Miss
DEAR MADAM I understand you have got the school but I cant possibly
board you as social equality is not custom in this country I dont
think it would be pleasant for you nor for us either I wrote this in
order for you to look out some other place You need not depend on
getting board with us
FEBRUARY 2 1889
This letter was written to a cultivated Northern young lady who had
graduated at one of the best high schools in the country and held a
special recommendation besides her diploma on account of her
excellency as a student and practice teacher She went South to help
these people in their great need It was for Christs sake and in His
name that she entered this field She secured board of a white family
but when they learned that she was going to teach the blacks and seek to
lead them to Christ this letter was sent her Every door was closed
against this Christian woman because she was trying to save the poor and
ignorant And it is eighteen hundred and eightynine of the Christian
era and in free America
But this plucky Yankee girl did not so give up her school She found a
boarding place in the home of one of our missionaries two miles away
and she tramps across these two miles twice a day patiently putting in
her best services to bring light into the dense darkness of the very
community whose doors were closed against her
In connection with this incident of narrow prejudice read these words
from Dr Haygoods Pleas for Progress In all truth and common sense
there is no reason for discounting in any respect a white man or woman
simply for teaching negroes It is absurd I believe it is sinful
These earnest words were spoken by the eloquent divine to his Southern
brethren August 2 1883 six long years ago If they only carried the
conviction of the people to whom he appealed How strangely they sound
standing so close to this letter refusing board to a young lady because
she is teaching these very negroes How long O Lord how long
The semiannual meeting of the Womans Home Missionary Association met
in the Beneficent Congregational Church or Old Round Top as the
street car conductor called it Providence April 3d The weather was
extremely unfavorable as New England weather has been lately as a
rule but there was a good attendance and deep interest All the
missionary societies of the Congregational churches which do work in
America were represented The field work of the Womans Association has
passed into the control of the national societies The future looks very
bright for its increasing usefulness
And now Pleasant Hill Tenn rejoices in the sweet music of one of the
Smith organs Mr SD Smith is making many schools happy and adding
greatly to their efficiency by his generous gifts of organs
WHAT THE WORLD SAYS
BLACK SAINTS AND WHITE
Do colored folks retain their complexion when they go to heaven This is
a question of some importance to the members of the Diocesan Convention
of the Protestant Episcopal churches of Charleston SC Not long ago
the Convention appointed a special committee to consider and report upon
the subject of the admission of negro clergymen and laymen as members of
that body Their action was taken with the view of bringing the
Charleston churches if possible into harmony with the other Episcopal
congregations of the State In 1887 the former had seceded in
consequence of the adoption of a resolution which the Charleston
brethren regarded as a virtual obliteration of the colorline
Thursday the report of the committee was made public It proposes a
separate convocation for the colored churches under the ministration of
the bishop and consents to the admission to the Convention of colored
clergymen who have been associated with the church for twelve months
prior to May 1889 If the report is adopted three negro ministers will
sit as members but no lay delegates will be eligible The committee
were willing to forego their prejudice out of deference to the holy
office They felt that the color of a clergymans skin although it was
no doubt a very serious ground of objection when it happened to be
black should not overcome the respect due to the sanctity of his
official calling His cloth so to speak saved him and what would have
been denied to the man it was possible to concede to the priest
Under these circumstances the gravity of the question Do colored folks
retain their complexion when they go to heaven is obvious The
concession which the committee of the Diocesan Convention make is but a
reaffirmation of the Charleston brethrens aversion to anything that
smacks of an approach to association of the two races on terms of
equality If there are colored saints in Paradise it will be utterly
impossible for the Charleston white saints of the Episcopal denomination
to feel at home there The only chance of reconciling them to a heaven
so liberally disposed would depend on the adoption of some such plan as
that recommended by the committee as a modus vivendi in the church on
earth That is to say if the colored saints were corraled by
themselvesif their convocations were separate from the convocations of
the white saintsif they were not admitted to the white circles of
celestial society as equal partakers of the privileges of the heavenly
kingdomthe Caucasian angels from Charleston might be willing to pass
their eternity in such a place
It is very essential for them therefore to know whether there are in
fact any colored saints in heaven and if there are whether the
divisions of the Fathers house into many mansions admits of an
arrangement whereby the angelic brunettes may occupy one set of quarters
and the Charleston blondes another Until these problems are solved to
their satisfaction we do not see how our Christian friends of the chief
city of South Carolina can contemplate a future life with any degree of
equanimity Their faith may be equal to the removal of mountains and
their virtues may entitle them to all the felicity of the spirits of
just men made perfect but if it is the rule of the happy land far
far away that a black saint is just as good as a white one how much
more rational it would be for them to prefer annihilation to
immortality
