The Nest of the Sparrowhawk
CHAPTER I
THE HOUSE OF A KENTISH SQUIRE
Master HymnofPraise Busy folded his hands before him ere he spoke
Nay but I tell thee woman that the Lord hath no love for such
frivolities and alack but tis a sign of the times that an English
Squire should favor such evil ways
Evil ways The Lord love you Master HymnofPraise and pray do you
call half an hour at the skittle alley evil ways
Aye evil it is to indulge our sinful bodies in such recreation as doth
not tend to the glorification of the Lord and the sanctification of our
immortal souls
He who sermonized thus unctuously and with eyes fixed with stern
disapproval on the buxom wench before him was a man who had passed the
meridian of life not altogetherit may be surmisedwithout having
indulged in some recreations which had not always the sanctification of
his own immortal soul for their primary object The bulk of his figure
testified that he was not averse to good cheer and there was a certain
hidden twinkle underlying the severe expression of his eyes as they
rested on the pretty face and round figure of Mistress Charity that did
not necessarily tend to the glorification of the Lord
Apparently however the admonitions of Master HymnofPraise made but a
scanty impression on the young girls mind for she regarded him with a
mixture of amusement and contempt as she shrugged her plump shoulders
and said with sudden irrelevance
Have you had your dinner yet Master Busy
Tis sinful to address a single Christian person as if he or she were
several retorted the man sharply But Ill tell thee in confidence
mistress that I have not partaken of a single drop more comforting than
cold water the whole of today Mistress de Chavasse mixed the
sackposset with her own hands this morning and locked it in the
cellar of which she hath rigorously held the key Ten minutes ago when
she placed the bowl on this table she called my attention to the fact
that the delectable beverage came to within three inches of the brim
Meseems I shall have to seek for a less suspicious more
Christianspirited household whereon to bestow in the near future my
faithful services
Hardly had Master HymnofPraise finished speaking when he turned very
sharply round and looked with renewed sternnesswholly untempered by a
twinkle this timein the direction whence he thought a suppressed
giggle had just come to his ears But what he saw must surely have
completely reassured him there was no suggestion of unseemly ribaldry
about the young lad who had been busy laying out the table with spoons
and mugs and was at this moment vigorouslysomewhat ostentatiously
perhapspolishing a carved oak chair bending to his task in a manner
which fully accounted for the high color in his cheeks
He had long lanky hair of a pale strawcolor a thin face and high
cheekbones and was dressedas was also Master HymnofPraise Busyin
a dark purple doublet and knee breeches all looking very much the worse
for wear the brown tags and buttons with which these garments had
originally been roughly adorned were conspicuous in a great many places
by their absence whilst all those that remained were mere skeletons of
their former selves
The plain collars and cuffs which relieved the dull color of the mens
doublets were of singularly coarse linen not beyond reproach as to
cleanliness and altogether innocent of starch whilst the thick brown
worsted stockings displayed many a hole through which the flesh peeped
and the shoes of roughly tanned leather were down at heel and worn
through at the toes
Undoubtedly even in these days of more than primitive simplicity and of
sober habiliments Master HymnofPraise Busy butler at Acol Court in
the county of Kent and his henchman Master Courage Toogood would have
been conspicuous for the shabbiness and poverty of the livery which they
wore
The hour was three in the afternoon Outside a glorious July sun spread
radiance and glow over an oldfashioned garden over tall yew hedges
and fantastic forms of green birds and heads of beasts carefully cut and
trimmed over clumps of late roses and rough tangles of marguerites and
potentillas of stiff zinnias and richhued snapdragons
Through the open window came the sound of wood knocking against wood of
exclamations of annoyance or triumph as the game proceeded and every
now and then a ripple of prolonged laughter girlish fresh pure as the
fragrant air clear as the last notes of the cuckoo before he speaks his
final farewell to summer
Every time that echo of youth and gayety penetrated into the
oakraftered diningroom Master HymnofPraise Busy pursed his thick
lips in disapproval whilst the younger man had he dared would no
doubt have gone to the window and leaning out as far as safety would
permit have tried to catch a glimpse of the skittle alley and of a
lightcolored kirtle gleaming among the trees But as it was he caught
the older mans stern eyes fixed reprovingly upon him he desisted from
his work of dusting and polishing and looking up to the heavy oakbeam
above him he said with becoming fervor
Lord how beautifully thou dost speak Master Busy
Get on with thy work Master Courage retorted the other relentlessly
and mix not thine unruly talk with the wise sayings of thy betters
My work is done Master
Go fetch the pasties then the quality will be in directly rejoined
the other peremptorily throwing a scrutinizing look at the table
whereon a somewhat meager collation of cherries raspberries and
gooseberries and a more generous bowl of sackposset had been arranged
by Mistress Charity and Master Courage under his own supervision
Doubtless doubtless here interposed the young maid somewhat
hurriedly desirous perhaps of distracting the grave butlers attention
from the mischievous oglings of the lad as he went out of the room as
you remarkhemas thou remarkest this place of service is none to the
liking of such as  thee
She threw him a coy glance from beneath wellgrown lashes which caused
the saintly man to pass his tongue over his lips an action which of a
surety had not the desire for spiritual glory for its mainspring With
dainty hands Mistress Charity busied herself with the delicacies upon
the table She adjusted a gooseberry which seemed inclined to tumble
heaped up the currants into more graceful pyramids Womanlike whilst
her eyes apparently followed the motions of her hands they nevertheless
took stock of Master HymnofPraises attitude with regard to herself
She knew that in defiance of my Lord Protector and all his Puritans she
was looking her best this afternoon though her kirtle was as threadbare
as Master Courages breeches it was nevertheless just short enough to
display to great advantage her neatly turned ankle and wellarched foot
on which the thick stockingswelldarnedand shabby shoes sat not at
all amiss
Her kerchief was neatly folded white and slightly starched her cuffs
immaculately and primly turned back just above her round elbow and
shapely arm
On the whole Mistress Charity was pleased with her own appearance Sir
Marmaduke de Chavasse and the mistress were seeing company this
afternoon and the neighboring Kentish squires who had come to play
skittles and to drink sackposset might easily find a less welcome sight
than that of the serving maid at Acol Court
As for myself now resumed Mistress Charity after a slight pause
during which she had felt Master Busys admiring gaze fixed persistently
upon her as for myself Ill seek service with a lady less like to
find such constant fault with a hardworking maid
Master Courage had just returned carrying a large dish heaped up with
delicious looking pasties fresh from the oven brown and crisp with
butter and ornamented with sprigs of burrage which made them appear
exceedingly tempting
Charity took the dish from the lad and heavy as it was she carried it
to the table and placed it right in the very center of it She
rearranged the sprigs of burrage made a fresh disposition of the
baskets of fruit whilst both the men watched her openmouthed agape at
so much loveliness and grace
And she added significantly looking with illconcealed covetousness
at the succulent pasties where theres at least one dog or cat about
the place
I know not mistress said HymnofPraise that thou wast overfond
of domestic pets  Tis sinful to
La Master Busy you  hem  thou mistakest my meaning I have no
love for such creaturesbut without so much as a kitten about the
house prithee how am I to account to my mistress for the pasties and
and comfits  not to speak of breakages
There is always Master Courage suggested HymnofPraise with a
movement of the left eyelid which in the case of any one less saintly
might have been described as a sly wink
That there is not interrupted the lad decisively my stomach rebels
against comfits and sackposset could never be laid to my door
I give thee assurance Master Busy concluded the young girl that
the county of Kent no longer suits my constitution Tis London for me
and thither will I go next year
Tis a den of wickedness commented Busy sententiously in spite of
my Lord Protector who of a truth doth turn his back on the Saints and
hath even allowed the great George Fox and some of the Friends to
languish in prison whilst profligacy holds undisputed sway Master
Courage meseems those mugs need washing a second time he added with
sudden irrelevance Take them to the kitchen and do not let me set
eyes on thee until they shine like pieces of new silver
Master Courage would have either resisted the order altogether or at
any rate argued the point of the cleanliness of the mugs had he dared
but the saintly man possessed on occasions a heavy hand and he also
wore boots which had very hard toes and the lad realized from the
peremptory look in the butlers eyes that this was an occasion when both
hand and boot would serve to emphasize Master Busys orders with
unpleasant force if he himself were at all slow to obey
He tried to catch Charitys eye but was made aware once more of the
eternal truth that women are perverse and fickle creatures for she
would not look at him and seemed absorbed in the rearrangement of her
kerchief
With a deep sigh which should have spoken volumes to her adamantine
heart Courage gathered all the mugs together by their handles and
reluctantly marched out of the room once more
HymnofPraise Busy waited a moment or two until the clattering of the
pewter died away in the distance then he edged a little closer to the
table whereat Mistress Charity seemed still very busy with the fruit
and said haltingly
Didst thou really wish to go mistress  to leave thy fond adoring
HymnofPraise  to go mistress  and to break my heart
Charitys dainty headwith its tiny velvet cap edged with lawn which
hardly concealed sufficiently the wealth of her unruly brown hairsank
meditatively upon her left shoulder
Lord Master Busy she said demurely how was a poor maid to know
that you meant it earnestly
Meant it earnestly
Yes  a new kirtle  a gold ring  flowers  and sackposset
and pasties to all the guests she explained Is that what you mean
hem  what thou meanest Master Busy
Of a surety mistress  and if thou wouldst allow me to  to
To what Master Busy
To salute thee said the saintly man with a becoming blush as the
Lord doth allow his creatures to salute one another  with a chaste
kiss mistress
Then as she seemed to demur he added by way of persuasion
I am not altogether a poor man mistress and there is that in my
coffer upstairs put by as would please thee in the future
Nay I was not thinking of the money Master Busy said this daughter
of Eve coyly as she held a rosy cheek out in the direction of the
righteous man
Tis the duty even of a veracious chronicler to draw a discreet veil
over certain scenes full of blissful moments for those whom he portrays
There are no data extant as to what occurred during the next few
seconds in the old oakbeamed diningroom of Acol Court in the Island of
Thanet Certain it is that when next we get a peep at Master
HymnofPraise Busy and Mistress Charity Haggett they are standing side
by side he looking somewhat shamefaced in the midst of his obvious
joy and she supremely unconcerned once more absorbed in the apparently
neverending adornment of the refreshment table
Thoult have no cause to regret this mistress said Busy
complacently we will be married this very autumn and I have it in my
mindan it please the Lordto go up to London and take secret service
under my Lord Protector himself
Secret service Master Busy  hem  I mean HymnofPraise dear
secret service  What may that be
Tis a noble business Charity he replied and one highly commended
by the Lord the business of tracking the wicked to their lair of
discovering evil where tis hidden in dark places conspiracies against
my Lord Protector adherence to the cause of the banished tyrants and
and  so forth
Sounds like spying to me she remarked curtly
Spying  Spying didst thou say he exclaimed indignantly Fie on
thee Charity for the thought Secret service under my Lord Protector
tis called and a highly lucrative business too and one for which I
have remarkable aptitude
Indeed
Aye See the manner in which I find things out mistress This house
now  thou wouldst think tis but an ordinary house  eh
His manner changed the saintliness vanished from his attitude the
expression of his face became sly and knowing He came nearer to
Charity took hold of her wrist whilst he raised one finger to his
lips
Thou wouldst think tis an ordinary house  wouldst thou not he
repeated sinking his voice to a whisper murmuring right into her ear
so that his breath blew her hair about causing it to tickle her cheek
She shuddered with apprehension His manner was so mysterious
Yes  yes  she murmured terrified
But I tell thee that theres something going on he added
significantly
La Master Busy  you  you terrify me she said on the verge of
tears What could there be going on
Master Busy raised both his hands and with the right began counting off
the fingers of the left
Firstly he began solemnly theres an heiress secondly our
masterpoor as a church mousethirdly a young scholarsecretary they
call him though he writes no letters and is all day absorbed in his
studies  Well mistress he concluded turning a triumphant gaze on
her tell me prithee what happens
What happens Master HymnofPraise  I do not understand What
does happen
Ill tell thee he replied sententiously when I have found out but
mark my words mistress theres something going on in this house
Hush not a word to that young jackanapes he added as a distant
clatter of pewter mugs announced the approach of Master Courage Watch
with me mistress thoult perceive something And when I have found
out twill be the beginning of our fortunes
Once more he placed a warning finger on his lips once more he gave
Mistress Charity a knowing wink and her wrist an admonitory pressure
then he resumed his staid and severe manner his saintly mien and
somewhat nasal tones as from the gay outside world beyond the
windowembrasure the sound of many voices the ripple of young laughter
the clink of heeled boots on the stoneflagged path proclaimed the
arrival of the quality
CHAPTER II
ON A JULY AFTERNOON
In the meanwhile in a remote corner of the park the quality was
assembled round the skittlealley
Imagine Sir Marmaduke de Chavasse standing there as stiff a Roundhead
as ever upheld my Lord Protector and his Puritanic government in this
remote corner of the county of Kent dour in manner harshfeatured and
holloweyed dressed in dark doublet and breeches wholly void of tags
ribands or buttons His closely shorn head is flat at the back square
in front his cleanshaven lips though somewhat thick are always held
tightly pressed together Not far from him sits on a rough wooden seat
Mistress Amelia Editha de Chavasse widow of Sir Marmadukes elder
brother a goodlooking woman still save for the look of discontent
almost of suppressed rebellion apparent in the perpetual dark frown
between the straight brows in the downward curve of the wellchiseled
mouth and in the lowering look which seems to dwell for ever in the
handsome dark eyes
Dame Harrison too was there the large and portly dowager florid of
face dictatorial in manner dressed in the supremely unbecoming style
prevalent at the moment when everything that was beautiful in art as
well as in nature was condemned as sinful and ungodly she wore the dark
kirtle and plain ungainly bodice with its hard white kerchief folded
over her ample bosom her hair was parted down the middle and brushed
smoothly and flatly to her ears where but a few curls were allowed to
escape with wellregulated primness from beneath the horncomb and the
whole appearance of her looked almost grotesque surmounted as it was by
the modish highpeaked beaver hat a marvel of hideousness and
discomfort since the small brim afforded no protection against the sun
and the tall crown was a ready prey to the buffetings of the wind
Mistress Fairsoul Pyncheon too was there the wife of the Squire of
Ashe thin and small a contrast to Dame Harrison in her mild and
somewhat fussy manner her plain petticoat too was embellished with
paniers and in spite of the heat of the day she wore a tippet edged
with fur both of which frivolous adornments had obviously stirred up
the wrath of her more Puritanical neighbor
Then there were the men busy at this moment with hurling wooden balls
along the alley at the further end of which a holloweyed scraggy
youth in shirt and rough linen trousers was employed in propping up
again the fallen ninepins Squire John Boatfield had ridden over from
Eastry Sir Timothy Harrison had come in his aunts coach and young
Squire Pyncheon with his doting mother
And in the midst of all these sober folk of young men in severe
garments of portly dames and frowning squires a girlish figure
young alert vigorous wearing with the charm of her own youth and
freshness the unbecoming attire which disfigured her elders yet seemed
to set off her own graceful form her dainty bosom and pretty arms Her
kirtle too was plain and dull in color of a soft dovelike gray
without adornment of any kind but round her shoulders her kerchief was
daintily turned edged with delicate lace and showing through its filmy
folds peeps of her own creamy skin
Twas years later that Sir Peter Lely painted Lady Sue when she was a
great lady and the friend of the Queen she was beautiful then in the
full splendor of her maturer charms but never so beautiful as she was
on that hot July afternoon in the year of our Lord 1657 when heated
with the ardor of the game pleased undoubtedly with the adulation which
surrounded her on every side she laughed and chatted with the men
teased the women her cheeks aglow her eyes bright her brown
hairpersistently unrulyflying in thick curls over her neck and
shoulders
A remarkable talent good Sir Marmaduke Dame Harrison was saying to
her host as she cast a complacent eye on her nephew who had just
succeeded in overthrowing three ninepins at one stroke Sir Timothy
hath every aptitude for outdoor pursuits and though my Lord Protector
deems all such recreations sinful yet do I think they tend to the
development of muscular energy which later on may be placed at the
service of the Commonwealth
Sir Timothy Harrison at this juncture had the misfortune of expending
his muscular energy in hitting Squire Boatfield violently on the shin
with an illaimed ball
Damn ejaculated the latter heedless of the strict fines imposed by
my Lord Protector on unseemly language I  verily beg the ladies
pardon  but  this young jackanapes nearly broke my shinbone
There certainly had been an exclamation of horror on the part of the
ladies at Squire Boatfields forcible expression of annoyance Dame
Harrison taking no pains to conceal her disapproval
Horrid coarse creature this neighbor of yours good Sir Marmaduke
she said with her usual air of decision Meseems he is not fit company
for your ward
Dear Squire Boatfield sighed Mistress Pyncheon who was evidently
disposed to be more lenient how goodhumoredly he bears it Clumsy
people should not be trusted in a skittle alley she added in a mild
way which seemed to be peculiarly exasperating to Dame Harrisons
irascible temper
I pray you Sir Timothy here interposed Lady Sue trying to repress
the laughter which would rise to her lips forgive poor Squire John
You scarce can expect him to moderate his language under such
provocation
Oh his insults leave me completely indifferent said the young man
with easy unconcern his calling me a jackanapes doth not of necessity
make me one
No retorted Squire Boatfield who was still nursing his shinbone
maybe not Sir Timothy but it shows how observant I am
Oliver pick up Lady Sues handkerchief came in mild accents from
Mistress Pyncheon
Quite unnecessary good mistress rejoined Dame Harrison decisively
Sir Timothy has already seen it
And while the two young men made a quick and not altogether successful
dive for her ladyships handkerchief colliding vigorously with one
another in their endeavor to perform this act of gallantry
singlehanded Lady Sue gazed down on them with goodhumored contempt
laughter and mischief dancing in her eyes She knew that she was good to
look at that she was rich and that she had the pick of the county
aye of the South of England did she desire to wed Perhaps she thought
of this even whilst she laughed at the antics of her bevy of courtiers
all anxious to win her good graces
Yet even as she laughed her face suddenly clouded over a strange
wistful look came into her eyes and her laughter was lost in a quick
short sigh
A young man had just crossed the tiny rustic bridge which spanned the
haha dividing the flowergarden from the uncultivated park He walked
rapidly through the trees towards the skittle alley and as he came
nearer the merry lightheartedness seemed suddenly to vanish from Lady
Sues manner the ridiculousness of the two young men at her feet
glaring furiously at one another whilst fighting for her handkerchief
seemed now to irritate her she snatched the bit of delicate linen from
their hands and turned somewhat petulantly away
Shall we continue the game she said curtly
The young man all the while that he approached had not taken his eyes
off Lady Sue Twice he had stumbled against rough bits of root or branch
which he had not perceived in the grass through which he walked He had
seen her laughing gaily whilst Squire Boatfield used profane language
and smile with contemptuous merriment at the two young men at her feet
he had also seen the change in her manner the sudden wistful look the
quick sigh the irritability and the petulance
But his own grave face expressed neither disapproval at the one mood nor
astonishment at the other He walked somewhat like a somnambulist with
eyes fixedalmost expressionless in the intensity of their gaze
He was very plainly even poorly clad and looked a dark figure even
amongst these soberly appareled gentry The grass beneath his feet had
deadened the sound of his footsteps but Sir Marmaduke had apparently
perceived him for he beckoned to him to approach
What is it Lambert he asked kindly
Your letter to Master Skyffington Sir Marmaduke replied the young
man will you be pleased to sign it
Will it not keep said Sir Marmaduke
Yes an you wish it Sir I fear I have intruded I did not know you
were busy
The young man had a harsh voice and a strange brusqueness of manner
which somehow suggested rebellion against the existing conditions of
life He no longer looked at Lady Sue now but straight at Sir
Marmaduke speaking the brief apology between his teeth without opening
his mouth as if the words hurt him when they passed his lips
You had best speak to Master Skyffington himself about the business
rejoined Sir Marmaduke not heeding the mumbled apology he will be
here anon
He turned abruptly away and the young man once more left to himself
silently and mechanically moved again in the direction of the house
You will join us in a bowl of sackposset Master Lambert said
Mistress de Chavasse striving to be amiable
You are very kind he said none too genially in about halfanhour
if you will allow me There is another letter yet to write
No one had taken much notice of him Even in these days when kingship
and House of Lords were abolished the sense of social inequality
remained keen To this coterie of avowed Republicans young Richard
Lambertsecretary or whatnot to Sir Marmaduke a paid dependent at any
ratewas not worth more than a curt nod of the head a condescending
acknowledgment of his existence at best
But Lady Sue had not even bestowed the nod She had not actually taken
notice of his presence when he came the wistful look had vanished as
soon as the young mans harsh voice had broken on her ear she did not
look on him now that he went
She was busy with her game Nathless her guardians secretary was of no
more importance in the rich heiresss sight than that mute row of
ninepins at the end of the alley nor was there mayhap in her mind
much social distinction between the holloweyed lad who set them up
stolidly from time to time and the silent young student who wrote those
letters which Sir Marmaduke had not known how to spell
CHAPTER III
THE EXILE
But despite outward indifference with the brief appearance of the
soberlygarbed young student upon the scene and his abrupt and silent
departure all the zest seemed to have gone out of Lady Sues mood
The ingenuous flatteries of her little court irritated her now she no
longer felt either amused or pleased by the extravagant compliments
lavished upon her beauty and skill by portly Squire John by Sir Timothy
Harrison or the more diffident young Squire Pyncheon
Of a truth I sometimes wish Lady Sue that I could find out if you
have any faults remarked Squire Boatfield unctuously
Nay Squire she retorted sharply pray try to praise me to my female
friends
In vain did Mistress Pyncheon admonish her son to be more bold in his
wooing
You behave like a fool Oliver she said meekly
But Mother
Go make yourself pleasing to her ladyship
But Mother
I pray you my son she retorted with unusual acerbity do you want a
million or do you not
But Mother
Then go at once and get it ere that fool Sir Timothy or the odious
Boatfield capture it under your very nose
But Mother
Go say something smart to her at once  talk about your gray mare
she is over fond of horses
Then as the young Squire awkward and clumsy in his manner more
accustomed to the company of his own servants than to that of highborn
ladies made sundry unfortunate attempts to enchain the attention of the
heiress his worthy mother turned with meek benignity to Sir Marmaduke
A veritable infatuation good Sir Marmaduke she said with a sigh
quite against my interests you know I had no thought to see the dear
lad married so soon nor to give up my home at the Dene yet in favor of
a new mistress Not but that Oliver is not a good son to his
mothersuch a good ladand such a good husband he would be to any
girl who
A strange youth that secretary of yours Sir Marmaduke here
interposed Dame Harrison in her loud dictatorial voice breaking in on
Mistress Pyncheons dithyrambs modest he appears to be and silent
too a paragon meseems
She spoke with obvious sarcasm casting covert glances at Lady Sue to
see if she heard
Sir Marmaduke shrugged his shoulders
Lambert is very industrious he said curtly
I thought secretaries never did anything but suck the ends of their
pens suggested Mistress Pyncheon mildly
Sometimes they make love to their employers daughter retorted Dame
Harrison spitefully for Lady Sue was undoubtedly lending an ear to the
conversation now that it had the young secretary for object She was not
watching Squire Boatfield who was wielding the balls just then with
remarkable prowess and at this last remark from the portly old dame
she turned sharply round and said with a strange little air of
haughtiness which somehow became her very well
But then you see mistress Master Lamberts employer doth not possess
a daughter of his ownonly a ward  mayhap that is the reason why his
secretary performs his duties so well in other ways
Her cheeks were glowing as she said this and she looked quite defiant
as if challenging these disagreeable mothers and aunts of
fortunehunting youths to cast unpleasant aspersions on a friend whom
she had taken under her special protection
Sir Marmaduke looked at her keenly a deep frown settled between his
eyes at sight of her enthusiasm His face suddenly looked older and
seemed more dour more repellent than before
Sue hath such a romantic temperament he said dryly speaking between
his teeth and as if with an effort Lamberts humble origin has fired
her imagination He has no parents and his elder brother is the
blacksmith down at Acol his aunt who seems to have had charge of the
boys ever since they were children is just a common old woman who lives
in the villagea strict adherent so I am told of this new sect whom
Justice Bennet of Derby hath so justly nicknamed Quakers They talk
strangely these people and believe in a mighty queer fashion I know
not if Lambert be of their creed for he does not use the thee and
thou when speaking as do all Quakers so I am told but his empty
