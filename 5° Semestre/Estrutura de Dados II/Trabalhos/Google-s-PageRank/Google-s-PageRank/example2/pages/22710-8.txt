Henrys suggestion had set them all thinking and the vein was so
unfamiliar that they did not at once find much to say
I should think finally remarked George that such an old folks
party would afford a chance for some pretty careful study and some
rather good acting
Fifty years will make us all not far from seventy What shall we look
like then I wonder musingly asked Mary Fellows
She was the demurest dreamiest of the three girls the most of a woman
and the least of a talker She had that poise and repose of manner which
are necessary to make silence in company graceful
We may be sure of one thing anyhow and that is that we shall not
look and feel at all as we do now said Frank I suppose he added
if by a gift of second sight we could see tonight as in a glass
what we shall be at seventy we should entirely fail to recognize
ourselves and should fall to disputing which was which
Yes and we shall doubtless have changed as much in disposition as in
appearance added Henry Now for one I ve no idea what sort of a
fellow my old man will turn out I dont believe people can generally
tell much better what sort of old people will grow out of them than what
characters their children will have A little better perhaps but not
much Just think how different sets of faculties and tastes develop and
decay come into prominence and retire into the background as the years
pass A trait scarcely noticeable in youth tinges the whole man in age
What striking dramatic effects are lost because the drama of life is
spun out so long instead of having the ends brought together observed
George The spectators lose the force of the contrasts because they
forget the first part of every role before the latter part is reached
One fails in consequence to get a realizing sense of the sublime
inconsistencies of every lifetime
That difficulty is what we propose in a small way to remedy next
Wednesday night replied Henry
Mary professed some scruples It was so queer she thought it must be
wrong It was like tempting Providence to take for granted issues in his
hands and masquerade with uncreated things like their own yet unborn
selves But Frank reminded her that the same objection would apply to
any arrangement as to what they should do next week
Well but offered Jessie is it quite respectful to make sport of
old folks even if they are ourselves
My conscience is clear on that point said Frank Its the only way
we can get even with them for the deprecating contemptuous way in which
they will allude to us over their snuff and tea as callow and flighty
youth if indeed they deign to remember us at all which is nt likely
I m all tangled up in my mind said Nellie with an air of
perplexity between these old people you are talking about and
ourselves Which is which It seems odd to talk of them in the third
person and of ourselves in the first Are nt they ourselves too
If they are then certainly we are not replied Henry You may take
your choice
The fact is he added as she looked still more puzzled there are
halfa dozen of each one of us or a dozen if you please one in fact
for each epoch of life and each slightly or almost wholly different
from the others Each one of these epochs is foreign and inconceivable
to the others as ourselves at seventy now are to us Its as hard to
suppose ourselves old as to imagine swapping identities with another
And when we get old it will be just as hard to realize that we were
ever young So that the different periods of life are to all intents and
purposes different persons and the first person of grammar ought to
be used only with the present tense What we were or shall be or do
belongs strictly to the third person
You would make sad work of grammar with that notion said Jessie
smiling
Grammar needs mending just there replied Henry The three persons of
grammar are really not enough A fourth is needed to distinguish the
ego of the past and future from the present ego which is the only true
one
Oh youre getting altogether too deep for me said Jessie Come
girls what in the world are we going to get to wear next Wednesday
Sure enough cried they with one accord while the musing look in
their eyes gave place to a vivacious and merry expression
My mother is nt near as old as we re going to be Her things wont
do said Nellie
Nor mine echoed Jessie but perhaps Marys grandmother will let us
have some of her things
In that case suggested Frank it will be only civil to invite her to
the party
To be sure why not agreed Jessie It is to be an old folks
party and her presence will give a reality to the thing
I dont believe she ll come said George You see being old is dead
earnest to her and she wont see the joke
But Mary said she would ask her anyway and so that was settled
My father is much too large in the waist for his clothes to be of any
service to me said George lugubriously
But Frank reminded him that this was a hint as to his getup and that
he must stuff with pillows that the proverb might be fulfilled Like
father like son
And then they were rather taken aback by Henrys obvious suggestion that
there was no telling what the fashion in dress would be in a d 1925
even if he added the scientists leave us any A D by that time
though Frank remarked here that a d would answer just as well as Anno
Darwinis if worst came to worst But it was decided that there was no
use trying after prophetical accuracy in dress since it was out of
the question and even if attainable would not suggest age to their own
minds as would the elderly weeds which they were accustomed to see
Its rather odd is nt it said Jessie gravely that it did nt
occur to anybody that in all probability not over one or two of us at
most will be alive fifty years hence
Lets draw lots for the two victims and the rest of us will appear as
ghosts suggested Frank grimly
Poor two sighed Nellie I m sorry for them How lonely they will
be Im glad I have nt got a very good constitution
But Henry remarked that Jessie might have gone further and said just as
truly that none of them would survive fifty years or even ten
We may some of us escape the pang of dying as long as that said he
but that is but a trifle and not a necessary incident of death The
essence of mortality is change and we shall be changed Ten years will
see us very different persons What though an old dotard calling himself
Henry Long is stumping around fifty years hence what is that to me I
shall have been dead a half century by that time
The old gentleman you speak so lightly of will probably think more
tenderly of you than you do of him said Jessie
I dont believe it answered Henry In fact if we were entirely true
to nature next Wednesday it would spoil the fun for we probably should
not if actually of the age we pretend think of our youth once a year
much less meet to talk it over
Oh I dont think so protested Nellie I m sure all the storybooks
and poetry say that old folks are much given to reviewing their youth in
a pensive regretful sort of way
Thats all very pretty but it s all gammon in my opinion responded
Henry The poets are young people who know nothing of how old folks
feel and argue only from their theory of the romantic fitness of
things I believe that reminiscence takes up a very small part of old
persons time It would furnish them little excitement for they have
lost the feelings by which their memories would have to be interpreted
to become vivid Remembering is dull business at best I notice that
most persons even of eventful lives prefer a good novel to the
pleasures of recollection It is really easier to sympathize with the
people in a novel or drama than with our past selves We lose a
great source of recreation just because we cant recall the past more
vividly
How shockingly Henry contradicts tonight was the only reply Nellie
deigned to this long speech
What shall we call each other next Wednesday asked Mary By our
first names as now
Not if we are going to be prophetically accurate said Henry Fifty
years hence in all probability we shall most of us have altogether
forgotten our present intimacies and formed others quite inconceivable
now I can imagine Frank over there scratching his bald head with his
spectacle tips and trying to recall me Hen Long Hen Longlet
me think name sounds familiar and yet I cant quite place him Did nt
I know him at C or was it at college Bless me how forgetful I
m growing
They all laughed at Henrys bit of acting Perhaps it was only sparkles
of mirth but it might have been glances of tender confidence that shot
between certain pairs of eyes betokening something that feared not
time This is in no sort a love story but such things cant be wholly
prevented
The girls however protested that this talk about growing so utterly
away from each other was too dismal for anything and they would nt
believe it anyhow The oldfashioned notions about eternal constancy
were ever so much nicer It gave them the cold shivers to hear Henrys
antemortem dissection of their friendship and that young man was
finally forced to admit that the members of the club would probably
prove exceptions to the general rule in such matters It was agreed
therefore that they should appear to know each other at the old folks
party
All you girls must of course be called Mrs instead of Miss
suggested Frank though you will have to keep your own names that
is unless you prefer to disclose any designs you may have upon other
peoples for which piece of impertinence Nellie who sat next him
boxed his earsfor the reader must know that these young people were
on a footing of entire familiarity and long intimacy
Do you know what time it is asked Mary who by virtue of the sweet
sedateness of her disposition was rather the monitress of the company
Its twelve oclock an hour after the clubs curfew
Well remarked Henry rousing from the fit of abstraction in which he
had been pursuing the subject of their previous discussion it was to
be expected we should get a little mixed as to chronology over such talk
as this
With our watches set fifty years ahead there ll be no danger of
overstaying our time next Wednesday anyhow added Frank
Soon the girls presented themselves in readiness for outdoors and in a
pleasant gust of goodbys and parting jests the party broke up
Goodby for fifty years Jessie called after them from the stoop as
the merry couples walked away in the moonlight
The following week was one of numerous consultations among the girls
Grandmother Fellowss wardrobe was pretty thoroughly rummaged under that
goodnatured old ladys superintendence and many were the queer effects
of old garments upon young figures which surprised the steadygoing
mirror in her quiet chamber
I m afraid I can never depend on it again said Mrs Fellows
She had promised to be at the party
She looked so grave when I first asked her Mary explained to the
girls that I was sorry I spoke of it I was afraid she thought we
wanted her only as a sort of convenience to help out our pantomime by
the effect of her white hair But in a minute she smiled in her cheery
way and said as if she saw right through me I suppose my child you
think being old a sort of misfortune like being hunchbacked or blind
and are afraid of hurting my feelings but you need nt be The good
Lord has made it so that at whichever end of life we are the other end
looks pretty uninteresting and if it wont hurt your feelings to have
somebody in the party who has got through all the troubles you have yet
before you I should be glad to come That was turning the tables for
us pretty neatly eh girls
The young ladies would not have had the old lady guess it for worlds
but truth compels me to own that all that week they improved every
opportunity furtively to study Mrs Fellowss gait and manner with a
view to perfecting their parts
Frank and George met a couple of times in Henrys room to smoke it
over and settle details and Henry called on Jessie to arrange several
concerted features of the programme and for some other reasons for
aught I know
As each one studied his or her part and strove in imagination to
conceive how they would act and feel as old men and old women they grew
more interested and more sensible of the mingled pathos and absurdity
of the project and its decided general effect of queerness They all
set themselves to make a study of old age in a manner that had never
occurred to them before and never does occur to most people at all
Never before had their elderly friends received so much attention at
their hands
In the prosecution of these observations they were impressed with the
entire lack of interest generally felt by people in the habits and
manners of persons in other epochs of life than their own In respect
of age as in so many other respects the world lives on fiats with
equally little interest in or comprehension of the levels above or below
them And a surprising thing is that middle age is about as unable to
recall and realize youth as to anticipate age Experience seems to go
for nothing in this matter
They thought they noticed too that old people are more alike than
middleaged people There is something of the same narrowness and
similarity in the range of their tastes and feelings that is marked in
children The reason they thought to be that the interests of age have
contracted to about the same scope as those of childhood before it has
expanded into maturity The skein of life is drawn together to a point
at the two ends and spread out in the middle Middle age is the period
of most diversity when individuality is most pronounced The members of
the club observed with astonishment that however affectionately we
may regard old persons we no more think of becoming like them than
of becoming negroes If we catch ourselves observing their senile
peculiarities it is in a purely disinterested manner with a complete
and genuine lack of any personal concern as with a state to which we
are coming
They could not help wondering if Henry were not right about people never
really growing old but just changing from one personality to another
They found the strange inability of one epoch to understand or
appreciate the others hard to reconcile with the ordinary notion of a
persistent identity
Before the end of the week the occupation of their minds with the
subject of old age produced a singular effect They began to regard
every event and feeling from a double standpoint as present and as
past as it appeared to them and as it would appear to an old person
Wednesday evening came at last and a little before the hour of eight
five venerable figures more or less shrouded might have been seen
making their way from different parts of the village toward the Fellows
mansion The families of the members of the club were necessarily in the
secret and watched their exit with considerable laughter from behind
blinds But to the rest of the villagers it has never ceased to be a
puzzle who those elderly strangers were who appeared that evening and
were never before or since visible For once the Arguseyed curiosity of
a Yankee village compared with which French or Austrian police are easy
to baffle was fairly eluded
Eight oclock was the hour at which the old folks party began and the
reader will need a fresh introduction to the company which was assembled
at that time in Mary Fellowss parlor Mary sat by her grandmother
who from time to time regarded her in a halfpuzzled manner as if it
required an effort of her reasoning powers to reassure her that the
effect she saw was an illusion The girls brown hair was gathered back
under a lace cap and all that appeared outside it was thickly powdered
She wore spectacles and the warm tint of her cheeks had given place to
the opaque saffron hue of age She sat with her hands in her lap their
fresh color and dimpled contour concealed by black lace halfgloves The
fullness of her young bosom was carefully disguised by the arrangement
of the severely simple black dress she wore which was also in other
respects studiously adapted to conceal by its stiff and angular lines
the luxuriant contour of her figure As she rose and advanced to welcome
Henry and Jessie who were the last to arrive it was with a striking
imitation of the tremulously precipitate step of age
Jessie being rather taller than the others had affected the stoop of
age very successfully She wore a black dress spotted with white and
her whitened hair was arranged with a high comb She was the only one
without spectacles or eyeglasses Henry looked older and feebler than
any of the company His scant hair hung in thin and long white locks
and his tall slender figure had gained a still more meagre effect from
his dress while his shoulders were bowed in a marked stoop his gait
was rigid and jerky He assisted himself with a goldheaded cane and
sat in his chair leaning forward upon it
George on the other hand had followed the hint of his fathers figure
in his makeup and appeared as a rubicund old gentleman large in the
waist bald with an apoplectic tendency a wheezy asthmatic voice and
a full white beard
Nellie wore her hair in a row of white curls on each side of her head
and in every detail of her dress and air affected the coquettish old
lady to perfection for which of course she looked none the younger
Her cheeks were rouged to go with that style
Frank was the ideal of the sprightly little old gentleman With his
brisk air natty eyeglasses cane and gloves and other items of dress
in the most correct taste he was quite the old beau His white hair was
crispy brushed back and his snowy mustache had rather a rakish effect
Although the transformation in each case was complete yet quite
enough of the features expression or bearing was apparent through the
disguise to make the members of the party entirely recognizable to each
other though less intimate acquaintances would perhaps have been at
first rather puzzled At Henrys suggestion they had been photographed
in their costumes in order to compare the ideal with the actual when
they should be really old
It is nt much trouble and the old folks will enjoy it some day We
ought to consider them a little Henry had said meaning by the old
folks their future selves
It had been agreed that in proper deference to the probabilities one
at least of the girls ought to illustrate the fat old lady But they
found it impossible to agree which should sacrifice herself for no
one of the three could in her histrionic enthusiasm quite forget her
personal appearance Nellie flatly refused to be made up fat and Jessie
as flatly while both the girls had too much reverence for the sweet
dignity of Mary Fellowss beauty to consent to her taking the part and
so the idea was given up
It had been a happy thought of Marys to get her two younger sisters
girls of eleven and sixteen to be present to enhance the venerable
appearance of the party by the contrast of their bloom and freshness
Are these your little granddaughters inquired Henry benevolently
inspecting them over the tops of his spectacles as he patted the elder
of the two on the head a liberty she would by no means have allowed
him in his proper character but which she now seemed puzzled whether to
resent or not
Yes replied Mary with an indulgent smile They wanted to see what
an old folks party was like though I told them they wouldnt enjoy it
much I remember I thought old people rather dull when I was their age
Henry made a little conversation with the girls asking them the list
of fatuous questions by which adults seem fated to illustrate the gulf
between them and childhood in the effort to bridge it
Annie dear just put that ottoman at Mrs Hydes feet said Mary to
one of the little girls I m so glad you felt able to come out this
evening Mrs Hyde I understood you had not enjoyed good health this
summer
I have scarcely been out of my room since spring until recently
replied Jessie Thank you my dear to the little girl but Dr
Sanford has done wonders for me How is your health now Mrs Fellows
I have not been so well an entire summer in ten years My daughter
Mrs Tarbox was saying the other day that she wished she had my
strength You know she is quite delicate said Mary
Speaking of Dr Sanford said Henry looking at Jessie he is really
a remarkable man My son has such confidence in him that he seemed quite
relieved when I had passed my grand climacteric and could get on his
list You know he takes no one under sixtythree By the way governor
he added turning around with some ado so as to face George I heard
he had been treating your rheumatism lately Has he seemed to reach the
difficulty
Remarkably replied George tenderly stroking his right knee in an
absent manner Why dont you think I walked half the way home from my
office the other day when my carriage was late
I wonder you dared venture it said Jessie with a shocked air What
if you had met with some accident
Thats what my son said answered George He made me promise never
to try such a thing again but I like to show them occasionally that Im
good for something yet
He said this with a he he of senile complacency ending in an
asthmatic cough which caused some commotion in the company Frank
got up and slapped him on the back and Mary sent Annie for a glass of
water
George being relieved and quiet once more restored Henry said to
Frank
By the way doctor I want to congratulate you on your sons last book
You must have helped him to the material for so truthful a picture of
American manners in the days when we were young I fear we have not
improved much since then There was a simplicity a naturalness in
society fifty years ago that one looks in vain for now There was it
seems to me much less regard paid to money and less of morbid social
ambition Dont you think so Mrs Tyrrell
Its just what I was saying only the other day replied Nellie Im
sure I dont know what we re coming to nowadays Girls had some modesty
when I was young and she shook her head with its rows of white curls
with an air of mingled reprobation and despair
Did you attend Professor Merryweathers lecture last evening Mrs
Hyde asked Frank adjusting his eyeglasses and fixing Jessie with
that intensity of look by which old persons have to make up for their
failing eyesight The hall was so near your house I did nt know but
you would feel like venturing out
My daughters insisted on my taking advantage of the opportunity it is
so seldom I go anywhere of an evening replied Jessie and I was very
much interested though I lost a good deal owing to the carrying on of
a young couple in front of me When I was a girl young folks didnt do
their courting in public
Mary had not heard of the lecture and Frank explained that it was one
of the tersemicentennial course on American society and politics fifty
years ago
By the way remarked George did you observe what difficulty they
are having in finding enough survivors of the civil war to make a
respectable squad The papers say that not over a dozen of both armies
can probably be secured and some of the cases are thought doubtful at
that
Is it possible said Henry And yet too it must be so but it
sounds strangely to one who remembers as if it were yesterday seeing
the grand review of the Federal armies at Washington just after the war
What a host of strong men was that and now scarcely a dozen left My
friends we are getting to be old people We are almost through with
it
Henry sat gazing into vacancy over the tops of his spectacles while the
old ladies wiped theirs and sniffed and sighed a little Finally Jessie
said
Those were heroic days My little granddaughters never tire of hearing
stories about them They are strong partisans too Jessie is a fierce
little rebel and Sam is an uncompromising Unionist only they both agree
in denouncing slavery
That reminds me said Frank smiling that our little Frankie came to
me yesterday with a black eye he got for telling Judge Bensons little
boy that people of his complexion were once slaves He had read it in
his history and appealed to me to know if it was nt true
I m not a bit surprised that the little Benson boy resented the
imputation said George I really dont believe that more than half
the people would be certain that slavery ever existed here and I
m sure that it rarely occurs to those who do know it No doubt that
company of old slaves at the centennialthat is if they can find
enough survivorswill be a valuable historical reminder to many
Dr Hays said Nellie will you settle a question between Mrs Hyde
and myself Were you in C it was then only a village along
between 1870 and 80 about forty or fifty years ago
Noand yet come to thinklet me seewhen did you say replied
Frank doubtfully
Between 1870 and 80 as nearly as we can make out probably about the
middle of the decade said Nellie
I think I was in C at about that time I believe I was still
living with my fathers family
I told you so said Nellie to Jessie and turning again to Frank she
asked
Do you remember anything about a social club there
I do replied Frank with some appearance of interest I recall
something of the sort quite distinctly though I suppose I have nt
thought of it for twenty years How did you ever hear of it Mrs Hyde
Why I was a member replied she briskly and so was Mrs Tyrrell We
were reminded of it the other day by a discovery Mrs Tyrrell made in an
old bureau drawer of a photograph of the members of the club in a group
taken probably all of fifty years ago and yellow as you can imagine
There was one figure that resembled you doctor as you might have
looked then and I thought too that I recalled you as one of the
members but Mrs Tyrrell could not and so we agreed to settle the
matter by appealing to your own recollection
Yes indeed said Frank I now recall the club very perfectly and it
seems to me Governor Townsley was also in it
Yes I think I was a member assented George though my recollections
are rather hazy
Mary and Henry being appealed to failed to remember anything about the
club the latter suggesting that probably it flourished before he came
to C Jessie was quite sure she recalled Henry but the others
could not do so with much positiveness
I will ask Mrs Long when I get home said Henry She has always
lived at C and is great for remembering dates Lets see what
time do you think it was
Mrs Tyrrell and I concluded it must have been between 1873 and 1877
said Jessie adding slyly for she was married in 1877 Mrs Tyrrell
did you bring that old photograph with you It might amuse them to look
at it
Nellie produced a small picture and adjusting their spectacles and
eyeglasses they all came forward to see it A group of six young
people was represented all in the very heyday of youth The spectators
were silent looking first at the picture and then at each other
Can it be said Frank that these were ever our pictures I hope
Mrs Tyrrell the originals had the forethought to put the names on the
back that we may be able to identify them
No said she we must guess as best we can First who is that
pointing to one of the figures
That must be Mrs Hyde for she is taller than the others suggested
Grandma Fellows
By the same token that must be Mrs Tyrrell for she is shorter said
Jessie though but for that I dont see how we could have told them
apart
How oddly they did dress in those days said Mary
Who can that be asked Frank pointing to the finestlooking of the
three young men If that is one of us there was more choice in our
looks than there is noweh Townsley
No doubt said George fifty years ago somebodys eye scanned those
features with a very keen sense of proprietorship What a queer feeling
it would have given those young things to have anticipated that we
should ever puzzle over their identities in this way
They finally agreed on the identity of Jessie Nellie and Frank and
of George also on his assuring them that he was once of slender figure
This left two figures which nobody could recognize though Jessie
insisted that the gentleman was Henry and Mary thought the other young
lady was a Miss Fellows a girl of the village who she explained had
died young many many years ago
Dont you remember her she asked them and her voice trembled with
a halfgenuine sort of selfpity as if for a moment she imagined
herself her own ghost
I recall her well said Frank tall grave sweet I remember she
used to realize to me the abstraction of moral beauty when we were
studying Paley together
I dont know when I have thought so much of those days as since I
received cards for your golden wedding Judge said Nellie to Henry
soon after How many of those who were present at your wedding will be
present at your golden wedding do you suppose
Not more than two or three replied Henry and yet the whole village
was at the wedding
Thank God he said a moment after that our friends scatter before
they die Otherwise old people like us would do nothing but attend
funerals during the last half of our lives Parting is sad but I prefer
to part from my friends while they are yet alive that I may feel it
less when they die One must manage his feelings or they will get the
better of him
It is a singular sensation said George to outlive ones generation
One has at times a guilty sense of having deserted his comrades It
seems natural enough to outlive any one contemporary but unnatural
to survive them as a massa sort of risky thing fraught with the
various vague embarrassments and undefined perils threatening one who
is out of his proper place And yet one does nt want to die though
convinced he ought to and thats the cowardly misery of it
Yes said Henry I had that feeling pretty strongly when I attended
the last reunion of our alumni and found not one survivor within five
classes of me I was isolated Death had got into my rear and cut me
off I felt ashamed and thoroughly miserable
Soon after tea was served Frank vindicated his character as an old
beau by a tottering alacrity in serving the ladies while George and
Henry by virtue of their more evident infirmity sat still and allowed
