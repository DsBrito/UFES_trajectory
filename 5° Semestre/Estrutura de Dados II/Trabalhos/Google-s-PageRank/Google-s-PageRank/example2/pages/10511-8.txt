CHAPTER I
A BOLT FOR FREEDOM
Most of the really important things in lifesuch as love and
deathhappen unexpectedly I know that my escape from Dartmoor did
We had just left the quarrieseighteen of us all dressed in that
depressing costume which King George provides for his less elusive
subjectsand we were shambling sullenly back along the gloomy road
which leads through the plantation to the prison The time was about
four oclock on a dull March afternoon
In the roadway on either side of us tramped an armed warder his
carbine in his hand his eyes travelling with dull suspicion up and
down the gang Fifteen yards away parallel with our route the sombre
figure of one of the civil guards kept pace with us through the trees
We were a cheery party
Suddenly without any warning one of the warders turned faint He
dropped his carbine and putting his hand to his head stumbled
heavily against the low wall that separated us from the wood The
clatter of his weapon falling in the road naturally brought all
eyes round in that direction and seeing what had happened the whole
eighteen of us instinctively halted
The gruff voice of the other warder broke out at once above the
shuffling of feet
What are you stopping for Get on there in front
From the corner of my eye I caught sight of the civil guard hurrying
towards the prostrate figure by the wall and then just as the
whole gang lurched forward again the thing happened with beautiful
abruptness
A broad squat figure shot out suddenly from the head of the column
and literally hurling itself over the wall landed with a crash
amongst the thick undergrowth There was a second shout from the
warder followed almost instantly by a hoarse command to halt as the
civil guard jerked his carbine to his shoulder
The fugitive paid about as much attention to the order as a tiger
would to a dog whistle He was off again in an instant bent almost
double and bursting through the tangled bushes with amazing
swiftness
Bang
The charge of buckshot whistled after him spattering viciously
through the twigs and several of the bolder spirits in the gang at
once raised a halfhearted cry of Murder
Stop that bawled the warder angrily and to enforce his words he
quickened his steps so as to bring him in touch with the offenders
As he did so I suddenly perceived with extraordinary clearness that I
should never again get quite such a good chance to escape The other
men were momentarily between me and the warder while the civil guard
his carbine empty was plunging through the trees in pursuit of his
wounded quarry
It was no time for hesitation and in any case hesitation is not one
of my besetting sins I recollect taking one long deep breath then
the next thing I remember is catching my toe on the top of the
wall and coming the most unholy purler in the very centre of an
exceptionally well armoured blackberry bush
This blunder probably saved my life it certainly accounted for my
escape The warder who evidently had more nerve than I gave him credit
for must have fired at me from where he was right between the heads
of the other convicts It was only my abrupt disappearance from the
top of the wall that saved me from being filled up with lead As
it was the charge whistled over me just as I fell and a devilish
unpleasant noise it made too
I didnt wait for him to reload I was out of that bush and off up the
hill in rather less time than it takes to read these words Where I
was going I scarcely thought my one idea was to put as big a distance
as possible between myself and the carbine before its owner could ram
home a second cartridge
As I ran twisting in and out between the trees and keeping my head
as low as possible I could hear behind me a hoarse uproar from my
fellowconvicts who by this time were evidently getting out of hand
No sound could have pleased me better The more boisterous the good
fellows became the less chance would the remaining warder have of
worrying about me As for the civil guardwell it seemed probable
that his time was already pretty fully engaged
My chief danger lay in the chance that there might be other warders in
the immediate neighbourhood If so they would doubtless have heard
the firing and have come running up at the first alarm I looked back
over my shoulder as I reached the top of the plantation which was
about a hundred yards from the road but so far as I could see there
was no one as yet on my track
My one chance lay in reaching the main wood that borders the Tavistock
road before the mounted guard could come up Between this and the
plantation stretched a long bare slope of hillside perhaps two
hundred yards across with scarcely enough cover on it to hide a
rabbit It was not exactly an inviting prospect but still the place
had to be crossed and there was nothing to be gained by looking at
it So setting my teeth I jumped out from under the shelter of the
trees and started off as fast as I could pelt for the opposite side
I had got about halfway over when there came a sudden shout away to
the right Turning my head as I ran I saw through the thin mist a
figure in knickerbockers and a Norfolk jacket vaulting over the low
gate that separated the moor from the road
I suppose he was a tourist for he had a small knapsack fastened to
his back and he was carrying a stick in his hand
Tallyho he yelled brandishing the latter and then without
hesitation he came charging across the open with the obvious intention
of cutting me off from the wood
For the first time in three years I laughed It was not a pretty
laugh and if my new friend had heard it his ardour in the chase
might perhaps have been a trifle cooled As it was he came on with
undiminished zest apparently quite confident in his ability to tackle
me singlehanded
We met about ten yards this side of the nearest trees
He rushed in on me with another whoop and I saw then that he was a
big powerful redfaced fellow of a rather coarse sporting typethe
kind of brute Ive always had a peculiar dislike for
Down you go he shouted and suiting the action to the word he
swung back his stick and lashed out savagely at my head
I didnt go down Instead of that I stepped swiftly in and striking
up his arm with my left hand I let him have my right bang on the
point of the chin Worlds of concentrated bitterness were behind it
and he went over backwards as if he had been struck by a coalhammer
It did me a lot of good that punch It seemed to restore my
selfrespect in a way that nothing else could have done You must have
been a convict yourself shouted at and ordered about like a dog for
three weary years to appreciate the full pleasure of being able once
more to punch a man in the jaw
At the moment however I had no time to analyze my feelings Almost
before the redfaced gentlemans shoulders had struck the ground I had
reached the railing which bounded the wood and putting one hand on
the top bar had vaulted over into its inviting gloom
Then just for an instant I stopped and like Lots wife cast one
hasty glance behind me Except for the motionless form of my late
adversary who appeared to be studying the sky the stretch of moor
that I had just crossed was still comfortingly empty So far no
pursuing warder had even emerged from the plantation With a sigh of
relief I turned round again and plunged forward into the thickest part
of the tangled brake ahead
It would have been difficult to find a better temporary hidingplace
than the one I had reached Thick with trees and undergrowth which
sprouted up from between enormous fissures and piles of granite rock
it stretched away for the best part of a mile and a half parallel with
the main road I knew that even in daylight the warders would find it
no easy matter to track me down at this time in the afternoon with
dusk coming rapidly on the task would be an almost impossible one
Besides it was starting to rain All the afternoon a thick cloud had
been hanging over North Hessary and now as scratched and panting I
forced my way on into the everincreasing gloom a fine drizzle began
to descend through the trees I knew what that meant In half an hour
everything would probably be blotted out in a wet grey mist and
except for posting guards all round the wood my pursuers would be
compelled to abandon the search until next morning It was the first
time that I had ever felt an affection for the Dartmoor climate
Guessing rather than judging my way I stumbled steadily forward until
I reached what I imagined must be about the centre of the wood By
this time I was wet through to the skin The thin particoloured
slop that I was wearing was quite useless for keeping out the rain
a remark that applied with almost equal force to my prisonmade
breeches and gaiters Apart from the discomfort however I was not
much disturbed I have never been an easy victim to chills and three
years in Princetown had done nothing to soften a naturally tough
constitution
Still there was no sense in getting more soaked than was necessary so
I began to hunt around for some sort of temporary shelter I found it
at last in the shape of a huge block of granite half hidden by the
brambles and stunted trees which had grown up round it Parting the
undergrowth and crawling carefully in I discovered at the base a kind
of hollow crevice just long enough to lie down in at full length
I cant say it was exactly comfortable but penal servitude has at
least the merit of saving one from being overluxurious Besides I
was much too interested in watching the steady thickening of the mist
outside to worry myself about trifles With a swiftness which would
have been incredible to any one who didnt know the Moor the damp
clammy vapour was settling down blotting out everything in its grey
haze Except for the dripping brambles immediately outside I could
soon see absolutely nothing beyond that it was like staring into a
blanket
I lay there quite motionless listening very intently for any sound of
my pursuers Only the persistent drip drip of the rain however and
the occasional rustle of a bird broke the silence If there were any
warders about they were evidently still some way from my hidingplace
but the odds were that they had postponed searching the wood until the
fog lifted
For the first time since my leap from the wall I found myself with
sufficient leisure to review the situation It struck me that only a
very hardened optimist could describe it as hopeful I had made my
bolt almost instinctively without stopping to think what chances I
had of getting away That these were meagre in the extreme was now
becoming painfully clear to me Even if I managed to slip out of
my present hidingplace into the still larger woods of the Walkham
Valley the odds were all in favour of my ultimate capture No escaped
prisoner had ever yet succeeded in retaining his liberty for more than
a few days and where so many gentlemen of experience had tried
and failed it seemed distressingly unlikely that I should be more
fortunate
I began to wonder what had happened to Cairns the man whose dash from
the ranks had been responsible for my own effort I knew him to be one
of the most resourceful blackguards in the prison and provided the
civil guards first shot had failed to stop him it was quite likely
that he too had evaded capture I hoped so with all my heart it would
distract quite a lot of attention from my own humble affairs
If he was still at liberty I couldnt help feeling enviously how much
better his chances of escape were than mine In order to get away from
the Moor it was plainly necessary to possess oneself of both food and
clothes and I could think of no other way of doing so except stealing
them from some lonely farm At anything of this sort I was likely to
prove a sorry bungler compared with such an artist as Cairns He was
one of the most accomplished cracksmen in England and feats which
seemed impossible to me would probably be the merest childs play to
him
Still it was no good worrying over what couldnt be helped My first
job was to get safely into the Walkham woods after that it would be
quite time enough to think about turning burglar
I sat up and looked out into the mist Things were as bad as ever and
quite suddenly it struck me with considerable force that by lying low
in this fashion I was making a most unholy idiot of myself Here I was
growing cold and stiff and wasting what was probably the best chance
I should ever have of reaching Walkhampton In fact I was playing
right into the hands of the warders
With an impatient exclamation I jumped to my feet The only question
was could I find my way out of the wood and if I did how on earth
was I to strike the right line over North Hessary It was quite on the
cards I might wander back into Princetown under the happy impression
that I was going in exactly the opposite direction
For a moment I hesitated then I made up my mind to risk it After all
the fog was as bad for the warders as it was for me and even if I
failed to reach the Walkham Valley I should probably find some other
equally good shelter before it lifted In either case I should have
the big advantage of having changed my hidingplace
Buttoning up my slop I advanced carefully through the dripping
brambles One could see rather less than nothing but so far as I
could remember the main Tavistock road was on my righthand side
This would leave North Hessary away to the left so turning in that
direction I set my teeth and took my first step forward into the
darkness
I dont suppose you have ever tried walking through a wood in a fog
but you can take my word for it that a less enjoyable form of exercise
doesnt exist I have often wondered since how on earth I managed to
escape a sprained ankle or a broken neck for carefully as I groped my
way forward it was quite impossible to avoid all the numerous crevices
and overhanging boughs which beset my path
I must have blundered into about fourteen holes and knocked my head
against at least an equal number of branches before the trees at last
began to thin and the darkness lighten sufficiently to let me see
where I was placing my feet I knew that by this time I must be
getting precious near the boundary of the wood outside which the
warders were now doubtless posted at frequent intervals So I stopped
where I was and sat down quietly on a rock for a few minutes to
recover my breath for I had been pretty badly shaken and winded by my
numerous tumbles
As soon as I felt better I got up again and taking very particular
care where I was treading advanced on tiptoe with a delicacy that
Agag might have envied I had taken about a dozen steps when all of a
sudden the railings loomed up in front of me through the mist
I put my hand on the top bar and then paused for a moment listening
breathlessly for any sound of danger Except for the faint patter
of the rain however everything was as silent as the dead Very
carefully I raised myself on the bottom rail lifted my legs over one
after the other and then dropped lightly down on to the grass beyond
As I did so a man rose up suddenly from the ground like a black
shadow and hurling himself on me before I could move clutched me
round the waist
Got yer he roared Then at the top of his voiceHere he is Help
Help
CHAPTER II
A BICYCLE AND SOME OVERALLS
I was taken so utterly by surprise that nothing except sheer strength
saved me from going over As it was I staggered back a couple of
paces fetching up against the railings with a bang that nearly
knocked the breath out of me By a stroke of luck I must have crushed
my opponents hand against one of the bars for with a cry of pain he
momentarily slackened his grip
That was all I wanted Wrenching my left arm free I brought up my
elbow under his chin with a wicked jolt and then before he could
recover I smashed home a short rightarm punch that must have landed
somewhere in the neighbourhood of his third waistcoat button Anyhow
it did the business all right With a quaint noise like the gurgle of
a halfempty bath he promptly released me from his embrace and sank
down on to the grass almost as swiftly and silently as he had arisen
I doubt if a more perfectly timed blow has ever been delivered but
unfortunately I had no chance of studying its effects Through the fog
I could hear the sound of footstepsquick heavy footsteps hurrying
towards me from either direction For one second I thought of
scrambling back over the railings and taking to the wood again Then
suddenly a kind of mischievous exhilaration at the danger gripped hold
of me and jumping over the prostrate figure on the ground I bolted
forwards into the mist The warders who must have been quite close
evidently heard me for from both sides came hoarse shouts of There
he goes Look out there and other wellmeant pieces of advice
It was a funny sort of sensation dodging through the fog feeling that
at any moment one might blunder up against the muzzle of a loaded
carbine The only guide I had as to my direction was the slope of the
ground I knew that as long as I kept on going uphill I was more or
less on the right track for the big granitestrewn bulk of North
Hessary lay right in front of me and I had to cross it to get to the
Walkham Valley
On I went the ground rising higher and higher until at last the
wet slippery grass began to give way to a broken waste of rocks and
heather I had reached the top and although I could see nothing on
account of the mist I knew that right below me lay the woods with
only about a mile of steeply sloping hillside separating me from their
agreeable privacy
Despite the cold and the wet and the fact that I was getting devilish
hungry my spirits somehow began to rise Good luck always acts on me
as a sort of tonic and so far I had certainly been amazingly lucky I
felt that if only the rain would clear up now and give me a chance of
getting dry Fate would have treated me as handsomely as an escaped
murderer had any right to expect
Making my way carefully across the plateau for the ground was stiff
with small holes and gullies and I had no wish to sprain my ankle I
began the descent of the opposite side The mist here was a good deal
thinner but night was coming on so rapidly that as far as seeing
where I was going was concerned I was very little better off than I
had been on the top of the hill
Below me away to the right a blurred glimmer of light just made
itself visible This I took to be Merivale village on the Tavistock
road and not being anxious to trespass upon its simple hospitality I
sheered off slightly in the opposite direction At last after about
twenty minutes scrambling I began to hear a faint trickle of running
water and a few more steps brought me to the bank of the Walkham
I stood there for a little while in the darkness feeling a kind of
tired elation at my achievement My chances of escape might still be
pretty thin but I had at least reached a temporary shelter For five
miles away to my left stretched the pleasantly fertile valley and
until I chose to come out of it all the warders on Dartmoor might hunt
themselves black in the face without finding me
I cant say exactly how much farther I tramped that evening When one
is stumbling along at night through an exceedingly illkept wood in a
state of hunger dampness and exhaustion ones judgment of distance
is apt to lose some of its finer accuracy I imagine however that I
must have covered at least three more miles before my desire to lie
down and sleep became too poignant to be any longer resisted
I hunted about in the darkness until I discovered a small patch of
fairly dry grass which had been more or less protected from the rain
by an overhanging rock I might perhaps have done better but I was
too tired to bother I just dropped peacefully down where I stood and
in spite of my bruises and my soaked clothes I dont think I had been
two minutes on the ground before I was fast asleep
Tommy Morrison always used to say that only unintelligent people
woke up feeling really well If he was right I must have been in a
singularly brilliant mood when I again opened my eyes
It was still fairly dark with the raw sour darkness of an early
March morning and all round me the invisible drip of the trees was as
persistent as ever Very slowly and shakily I scrambled to my feet My
head ached savagely I was chilled to the core and every part of
my body felt as if it had been trampled on by a powerful and rather
illtempered mule
I was hungry tooLord how hungry I was Breakfast in the prison is
not exactly an appetizing meal but at that moment the memory of its
thin gruel and greasy cocoa and bread seemed to me beautiful beyond
words
I looked round rather forlornly As an unpromising field for foraging
in a Dartmoor wood on a dark March morning takes a lot of beating
It is true that there was plenty of waterthe whole ground and air
reeked with itbut water even in unlimited quantities is a poor
basis for prolonged exertion
There was nothing else to be got however so I had to make the best
of it I lay down full length beside a small spring which gurgled
along the ground at my feet and with the aid of my hands lapped up
about a pint and a half When I had finished apart from the ache in
my limbs I felt distinctly better
The question was what to do next Hungry or not it would be madness
to leave the shelter of the woods until evening for not only would
the warders be all over the place but by this time everyone who lived
in the neighbourhood would have been warned of my escape My best
chance seemed to lie in stopping where I was as long as daylight
lasted and then staking everything on a successful burglary
It was not a cheerful prospect and before the morning was much older
it seemed less cheerful still If you can imagine what it feels
like to spend hour after hour crouching in the heart of a wood in a
pitiless drizzle of rain you will be able to get some idea of what I
went through If I had only had a pipe and some baccy things would
have been more tolerable as it was there was nothing to do but to sit
and shiver and grind my teeth and think about George
I thought quite a lot about George I seemed to see his face as he
read the news of my escape and I could picture the feverish way in
which he would turn to each edition of the paper to find out whether I
had been recaptured Then I began to imagine our meeting and Georges
expression when he realized who it was The idea was so pleasing that
it almost made me forget my present misery
It must have been about midday when I decided on a move In a way I
suppose it was a rash thing to do but I had got so cursedly cramped
and cold again that I felt if I didnt take some exercise I should
never last out the day Even as it was my legs had lost practically
all feeling and for the first few steps I took I was staggering about
like a drunkard
Keeping to the thickest part of the wood I made my way slowly
forward my idea being to reach the top of the valley and then lie low
again until nightfall My progress was not exactly rapid for after
creeping a yard or two at a time I would crouch down and listen
carefully for any sounds of danger I had covered perhaps a mile in
this spasmodic fashion when a gradual improvement in the light ahead
told me that I was approaching open ground A few steps farther and
through a gap in the trees a red roof suddenly came into view with a
couple of chimneypots smoking away cheerfully in the rain
It gave me a bit of a start for I had not expected to run into
civilization quite so soon as this I stopped where I was and did
a little bit of rapid thinking Where theres a house there must
necessarily be some way of getting at it and the only way I could
think of in this case was a private drive up the hill into the main
Devonport road If there was such a drive the house was no doubt a
private residence and a fairly large one at that
With infinite precaution I began to creep forward again Between the
trunks of the trees I could catch glimpses of a stout wood paling
about six feet high which apparently ran the whole length of the
grounds separating them from the wood On the other side of this
fence I could hear as I drew nearer a kind of splashing noise and
every now and then the sound of somebody moving about and whistling
The last few yards consisted of a strip of open grass marked by deep
cartruts Across this I crawled on my hands and knees and getting
right up against the fence began very carefully to search around for
a peephole At last I found a tiny gap between two of the boards It
was the merest chink but by gluing my eye to it I was just able to
see through
I was looking into a square gravelcovered yard in the centre of
which a man in blue overalls was cleaning the mud off a small
motor car He was evidently the owner for he was a prosperous
geniallooking person of the retired Major type and he was lightening
his somewhat damp task by puffing away steadily at a pipe I watched
him with a kind of bitter jealousy I had no idea who he was but
for the moment I hated him fiercely Why should he be able to potter
around in that comfortable selfsatisfied fashion while I Neil
Lyndon starved soaked and hunted like a wild beast was crouching
desperately outside his palings
It was a natural enough emotion but I was in too critical a position
to waste time in asking myself questions I realized that if burglary
had to be done here was the right spot By going farther I should
only be running myself into unnecessary risk and probably without
finding a house any more suitable to my purpose
I squinted sideways through the hole trying to master the geography
of the place On the left was a high bank of laurels and just at the
corner I could see the curve of the drive turning away up the hill
On the other side of the yard was a small garage built against the
wall while directly facing me was the back of the house
I was just digesting these details when a sudden sigh from the
gentleman in the yard attracted my attention He had apparently had
enough of cleaning the car for laying down the cloth he had been
using he stepped back and began to contemplate his handiwork
It was not much to boast about but it seemed to be good enough for
him At all events he came forward again and taking off the brake
proceeded very slowly to push the car back towards the garage At
the entrance he stopped for a moment and going inside brought out a
bicycle which he leaned against the wall Then he laboriously shoved
the car into its appointed place put back the bicycle and standing
in the doorway started to take off his overalls
I need hardly say I watched him with absorbed interest The sight of
the bicycle had sent a little thrill of excitement tingling down my
back for it opened up possibilities in the way of escape that five
minutes before had seemed wildly out of reach If I could only steal
the machine and the overalls as well I should at least stand a good
chance of getting clear away from the Moor before I was starved or
captured In addition to that I should be richer by a costume which
would completely cover up the tasteful but rather pronounced pattern
of my clothes
My heart beat faster with excitement as with my eye pressed tight to
the peephole I followed every movement of my unconscious quarry
Whistling cheerfully to himself he stripped off the dark blue cotton
trousers and oilstained jacket that he was wearing and hung them on a
nail just inside the door Then he gave a last look round presumably
to satisfy himself that everything was in order and shutting the door
with a bang turned the key in the lock
I naturally thought he was going to stuff that desirable object into
his pocket but as it happened he did nothing of the kind With a
throb of halfincredulous delight I saw that he was standing on
tiptoe inserting it into some small hidingplace just under the edge
of the iron roof
I didnt wait for further information At any moment someone might
have come blundering round the corner of the paling and I felt that I
had tempted Fate quite enough already So abandoning my peephole
I turned round and with infinite care crawled back across the grass
into the shelter of the trees
Once there however I rolled over on the ground and metaphorically
hugged myself The situation may not appear to have warranted such
excessive rapture but when a man is practically hopeless even the
wildest of possible chances comes to him like music and sunshine
Forgetting my hunger and my wet clothes in my excitement I lay there
thinking out my plan of action I could do nothing of course until
it was dark in fact it would be really better to wait till the
household had gone to bed for several of the back windows looked
right out on the garage Then provided I could climb the paling and
get out the bicycle without being spotted I had only to push it up
the drive to find myself on the Devonport road
With this comforting reflection I settled myself down to wait It was
at least four hours from darkness with another four to be added to
that before I dared make a move Looking back now I sometimes wonder
how I managed to stick it out Long before dusk my legs and arms
had begun to ache again with a dull throbbing sort of pain that got
steadily worse while the chill of my wet clothes seemed to eat into
my bones Once or twice I got up and crawled a few yards backwards and
forwards but the little additional warmth this performance gave me
did not last long I dared not indulge in any more violent exercise
for fear that there might be warders about in the wood
What really saved me I think was the rain stopping It came to an
end quite suddenly in the usual Dartmoor fashion and within half an
hour most of the mist had cleared off too I knew enough of the local
weather signs to be pretty certain that we were in for a fine night
and sure enough half an hour after the sun had set a large moon was
shining down from a practically cloudless sky
From where I was lying I could by raising my head just see the
two top windows of the house About ten as near as I could judge
somebody lit a candle in one of these rooms and then coming to the
