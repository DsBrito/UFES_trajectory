being as it is by the nature of its case condemned to a sadder
sterner view of life than its uprightness justifies and deprived of
the helpful encouragement of so many sweet natures whose single aim
in life is to help other souls if they only knew how
And so as I said before it is with a most grateful remembrance of
certain gracious words of yours let fall in the stately house of God
where we have worshipped together in lecturerooms where I have sat
to hear you and in conversations held in quiet college rooms or
studious gardens that I place your name at the head of these pages
the first I have sent out to shift for themselves or rather to pass
whither the Inspirer of all earnest endeavour may appoint
I remain ever affectionately yours

PREFACE
There are several forms of temperament The kind that mostly
issues in biography is the practical temperament Poets have the
shortest memoirs and the most uninteresting The politician the
philanthropist the general make the best the most graphic Lives
The fact remains however that the question What has he done
though a specious is an unsatisfactory test of greatness
But there is a temperament called the Reflective which works slowly
and with little apparent result The very gift of expression is a
practical gift with the gift of expression the reflective man
becomes a writer a poet an artist without it he is unknown
The reflective temperament existing without any particular gift of
expression wants an exponent in these times Reflection is lost
sight of philanthropy is all the rage I assert that for a man to
devote himself to a reflective life that is in the eyes of the
world an indolent one is often a great sacrifice and even on that
account if not essentially valuable Philanthropy is generally
distressing often offensive sometimes disastrous
Nothing in this predetermined world fails of its effect as nothing
is without its cause There is a call to reflection which a man must
follow and his life then becomes an integral link in the chain of
circumstance Any intentional life affects the world it is only the
vague drifting existences that pass it by
The subject of this memoir was as the world counts reputation
unknown His only public appearance as far as I know besides the
announcement of his birth is the fact that his initials stand in a
dedication on the titlepage of a noble work of fiction
Arthur Hamilton left me his manuscripts papers and letters from
these and casual conversations I have had with him in old days
this little volume is constructed
CC
CHAPTER I
He was born November 2 1852 He was the second son of a retired
cavalry officer who lived in Hampshire Besides his elder brother
there were three sisters one of whom died His father was a wealthy
man and had built himself a small country house and planted the few
acres of ground round it very skillfully Major Hamilton was a very
religious man of the selfsufficient puritanical and evangelical
type that issues from discipline a martinet in his regiment a
domestic tyrant without intending to be He did not marry till
rather late in life and at the time when Arthur was growing upathe
time when memory intwines itself most lingeringly with its
surroundings the time which comes back to us at ecstatic moments
in later sadder daysaall the entourage of the place was at its
loveliest Nothing ever equalled the thrill he has told me of
finding the first thrushs nest in the laurels by the gate or of
catching the first smell of the lilac bushes in spring or the
pungent scent of the chamomile and wild celery down by the little
stream
The boy acquired a great love for Nature though not of the intimate
kind that poets have by instinct In moments of grief and despair
he wrote in later life I do not as some do crouch back to the
bosom of the great Mother she has it seems no heart for me when I
am sorry though she smiles with me when I am glad But he has told
me that he is able to enjoy a simple village scene in a way that
others can not easily understand a chestnut crowded with pink
spires the clack of a millwheel the gush of a green sluice out
of a mantled pool a little stream surrounded by flags and water
lobelias gave him all his life a keen satisfaction in his happy
moments I always gravitate to water he writes I could stop
and look at a little wayside stream for hours and a poolaI never
tire of it though it awes me when I am alone
The boy was afraid of trees as many children are If he had to go
out alone he always crossed the fields and never went by the wood
wandering in a wood at night was a childish nightmare of a peculiarly
horrible kind
I quote a few childish stories about him selecting them out of a
large number
His mother saying to him one day that the gardener was dead he burst
out laughing with that curious hysteria so common in children and
then after a little asked if they were going to bury him
His mother wishing to familiarize him with the idea of continued
existence after death dwelt on the fact that it was only his body
that was going to be buried his soul was in heaven
The boy said presently If his body is in the churchyard and his
soul in heaven where is David
Upon which his mother sent him down to the farm
He was often singularly oldfashioned in his ways If he was kept
indoors by a childish ailment he would draw his chair up to the
fire by his nurse and say Now that the children are gone out
nurse we can have a quiet talk And he always returned first of all
his brothers and sisters if they were playing in the garden that he
might have the pleasure of clapping his hands from the nursery window
to summon them in Children children come in he used to say
A curious little dialogue is preserved by his aunt in a diary He
laughed so immoderately at something that was said at lunch by one of
his elders that when his father inquired what the joke was he was
unable to answer It must be something very funny said his mother
in explanation Arthur never laughs unless there is a joke The
little boy became grave at once and said severely Theres hardly
ever anything to laugh at in what you say but I always laugh for
fear people should be disappointed
He was very sensitive to rebuke I am not so sensitive as I am
always supposed to be he said to me once I am one of those people
who cry when they are spoken to and do it again
For instance he told me that being very fond of music when he was
small he stole down one morning at six to play the piano His
father a very early riser was disturbed by the gentle tinkling and
coming out of his study asked him rather sharply why he couldnt do
something usefularead some Shakespeare He never played on the piano
again for months and for years never until he had ascertained that
his father was out It was a mistake he told me once apropos of
it If he had said that it disturbed him but that I might do it
later I should have been delighted to stop I always liked feeling
that I was obliging people
He disliked his father and feared him The tall handsome gentleman
accustomed to be obeyed in reality passionately fond of his
children dismayed him He once wrote on a piece of paper the words
I hate papa and buried it in the garden
For the rest he was an ordinary rather clever secretive child
speaking very little of his feelings and caring as he has told me
since very little for anybody except his nurse I cared about her
in a curious way I enjoyed the sensation of crying over imaginary
evils and I should not like to say how often in bed at night I used
to act over in my mind an imaginary deathbed scene of my nurse and
the pathetic remarks she was to make about Master Arthur and the
edifying bearing I was to show This was calculated within a given
time to produce tears and then I was content
He went to a private school which he hated and then to Winchester
which he grew to love The interesting earnest little boy merged into
the clumsy loosejointed schoolboy silent and languid There are
hardly any records of this time
My younger sister died he told me when I was at school I
experienced about ten minutes of grief my parents were overwhelmed
with anguish and I can remember that like a quick rather clever
child I soon came to comprehend the sort of remark that cheered
them and almost overdid it in my zeal I am overwhelmed with shame
he said whenever I look at my mothers letters about that time when
she speaks of the comfort I was to them It was a fraus pia but it
was a most downright fraus
I think I may relate one other curious incident among his public
school experiences it may seem very incredible but I have his word
for it that it is true
A sixthform boy took a fancy to me and let me sit in his room and
helped me in my work The night before he left the school I was
sitting there and just before I went away being rather overcome
with regretful sentiments he caught hold of me by the arm and said
among other things And now that I am going away and shall probably
never see you again I dont believe you care one bit I dont know
how I came to do it he said because I was never demonstrative
but I bent down and kissed him on the cheek and then blushed up to
my ears He let me go at once he was very much astonished and I
think not a little pleased but it was certainly a curious incident
During this time his intellectual development was proceeding slowly
I went through three phases he said I began by a curious love
for pastoral and descriptive poetry I read Thomson and Cowper
similes from Paradise Lost and other selections of my own I read
Tennyson and revelled in the music of the lines and words I
intended to be a poet
Then I became omnivorous and read everything whether I understood
it or not especially biographies I spent all my spare time in the
school library one only valuable thing have I derived from thataa
capacity for taking in the sense of a page at a glance and having a
verbal memory of a skimmed book for an hour or two superior to any
one that I ever met
Then there came an ebb and he read nothing but loafed all day
and tried to talk He had a notion he said that he could argue
Socratically and he was always trying to introduce metaphors into
his conversation But his remarks in a much later letter to a friend
on childish reading are so pertinent that I introduce them here
Never take a book away from a child unless it is positively vicious
that they should learn how to read a book and read it quickly is the
great point that they should get a habit of reading and feel a void
without it is what should be cultivated Never mind if it is trash
now their tastes will insensibly alter I like a boy to cram himself
with novels a day will come when he is sick of them and rejects
them for the study of facts What we want to give a child is
bookmindedness as some one calls it They will read a good deal
that is bad of course but innocence is as slippery as a ducks
back a boy really fond of reading is generally pureminded enough
When you see a robust active outofdoor boy deeply engrossed in a
book then you may suspect it if you like and ask him what he has
got it will probably have an animal bearing
Friendships more or less ardent butterflyhunting school games
constant visits to the cathedral for service to which he was always
keenly devoted uneventful holidays filled up most of his school
life His letters at this date are very ordinary his early precocity
seemed rather to the delight of his parents to have vanished
He was not a prig though rather exclusive not ungenial though
retiring A dreadful boy he writes of himself who is as mum as
a mouse with his elders and then makes his school friends roar with
laughter in the passage dumb at home a chatterbox at school
I had no religion at that time he writes with the exception of
six months when I got interested in it by forming a friendship
with an attractive ritualistic curate but my confirmation made no
impression on me and I think I had no moral feelings that I could
distinguish I had no inherent hatred of wrong or love for right
but I was fastidious and that kept me from being riotous and
undemonstrative which made me pure
CHAPTER II
Arthur went up to the University Trinity College Cambridge in
1870 he did not distinguish himself there or acquire more than he
had done at Winchester The one thing I learnt at Winchester that
has been useful to me since was how to tie up old letters my
housemaster taught me how to do thatait was about all he was fit
for The thing I learnt at Cambridge was to smoke my cousin Fred
taught me that and he was hardly fit for that
As it was at Cambridge that I first met him I will give a short
description of him as far as I can remember
He was a tall lounging fellow rather clumsy in his movements but
with a kind of stateliness about him he looked and was old for his
years He was a little shortsighted and wore glasses without them
his brow had that puzzled slightly bothered look often seen in
weaksighted people His face was not unattractive though rather
heavy his hair was dark and curlyahe let it grow somewhat long from
indolenceaand he had a drooping moustache He was one of the men
who without the slightest idea of doing so always managed to create
rather an impression As he lounged along the street with his hands
in his pockets generally alone people used to turn and look at him
If he had taken a line of any kind he would have been known
everywhereabut he did nothing
The occasion on which I met him first was in the rooms of a common
friend there was a small gathering of men He was sitting in a low
chair smoking intently It was the one occupation he loved he
hardly said anything though the conversation was very animated
silence was his latest phase but as it was his first term and he
was not very well acquainted with the party it appeared natural not
that being surrounded by dukes and bishops would have made the
slightest difference to him if he had been disposed to talk but he
was not talkative and held his tongue
There had been some discussion about careers and their relative
merits One rather cynical man had broken in upon the ambitious
projects that were being advanced with Well we must remember that
we are after all only average men
Yes said Arthur slowly from the depths of his chair no doubt
only not quite so average
The gentleman addressed who was a senior man stared for a moment at
the freshman who had ventured to correct him to whom he had not even
been introduced but Arthur was staring meditatively at the smoke
rising from his pipe and did not seem inclined to move or be moved
so he concluded not to continue the discussion
The only other thing I heard him say that night was as follows An
ardent enthusiast on the subject of missions was present who
speaking of an Indian mission lately started and apparently wholly
ineffective said But we must expect discouragement at first The
Church has always met with that
Yes said Arthur but we must also remember what people are very
apt to forget that ill success is not an absolute proof that God is
on our side
These two remarks slight as they were struck me and indeed I
have never quite forgotten that indefinable first impression of the
man There was a feeling about him of holding great things in
reserve an utter absence of selfconsciousness a sensation that he
did not value the opinions of other people that he did not regulate
his conduct by them which is very refreshing in these social days
when everybodys doings and sayings are ventilated and discussed so
freely He had none of the ordinary ambitions he did not want a
reputation I thought on ordinary grounds he struck me as liking
to observe and consider not to do or say
I am fond of guessing at character and forming impressions and I
very soon found out that these were not mistaken My way that night
lay with him as far as the gate of his college We struck up a kind
of acquaintanceship though I felt conscious that he did not in the
least care about doing so that he probably would not give me another
thought It seems strange reflecting on that evening that I should
now come to be his biographer
However I was interested in the type of character he displayed and
did not let the acquaintance drop I invited him to my rooms He
would not come of his own accord at first but byandby he got
habituated to me and not unfrequently strolled in
He never let any one into the secret of his motives he never
confessed to any plans for the future or to taking any interest in
one line of life more than another He was well off and did not spend
much except on his books which were splendid His rooms were untidy
to the last degree but liberally supplied with the most varied
contrivances for obtaining a comfortable posture Deep chairs and
sofas with devices for books and light and for writing in any
position When my mind is at work he said to me once I dont
like to be reminded of my body at all I want to forget that I have
one and so I always say my prayers lying down
He dressed badly or rather carelessly for he never gave the subject
a moments thought If his friends told him that a suit was shabby
he appeared in a day or two in a new one till that was similarly
noticed then it was discarded altogether He always wore one suit
till he had worn it out never varying it But he consulted fashion
to a certain extent My object he said is to escape notice to
look like every one else I think of all despicable people the
people who try to attract attention by a marked style of dress are
perhaps the lowest
His life at Cambridge was very monotonous for he enjoyed monotony
he used to say that he liked to reflect on getting up in the morning
that his day was going to be filled by ordinary familiar things He
got up rather late read his subjects for an hour or two strolled
about to see one or two friends lunched with them or at home
strolled in the afternoon often dropping in to Kings for the
anthem went back to his rooms for tea the one time at which he
liked to see his friends read or talked till hall and finally
settled down to his books again at ten reading till one or two in
the morning
He read very desultorily and widely Thus he would read books on
Arctic voyages for ten days and talk of nothing else then read
novels till he sickened for facts and fact till he sickened for
fiction biographies elementary science poetry general philosophy
particularly delighting in any ideal theories of life and discipline
in state or association but with a unique devotion to Hamlet
and As You Like It the Pilgrims Progress and Emersons
Representative Men He rarely read the Bible he told me and then
only in great masses at a sitting and the one thing that he disliked
with an utter hatred was theology of a settled and orthodox type
though next to the four books I have mentioned The Christian Year
and Ecce Homo were his constant companions
He did not care for history he used to lament it I have but a
languid interest in facts qua facts he said and I try to arrive
at history through biography I like to disentangle the separate
strands one at a time the fabric is too complex for me
He had the greatest delight in topography That is why he used to
say I delight in a flat country The idea of space is what I want
I like to see miles at a glance I like to see clouds leaguelong
rolling up in great masses from the horizonacloud perspective I
rejoice in seeing the fields hedgerow after hedgerow farm after
farm push into the blue distance It makes me feel the unity and the
diversity of life a city bewilders and confuses me but a great
tract of placid country gives me a broad glow of satisfaction
He went for a walking tour in the fens and returned enchanted By
Ely he said the line crosses a gigantic fenaWhittlesea mere in
old daysaand on a clear day you can see at least fifteen miles
either way As we crossed it a great skein of starlings rose out of
a little holt and streamed north the herons or quiet cattle stood
along the huge dykes You could see the scattered figures of old
labourers in the fields and then for miles and miles the squat
towers at which you were making staring over the flat giving you
a thrill every time you sighted them and right away west the low
hills that must have been the sandy downs that blocked the restless
plunging sea they must have looked for centuries over rollers and
salt marsh and lagoon felt the tread of strange herds and beasts
about them till they have become the quiet slopes of a sunny park
or the simple appendages of a remote hill farm
But his greatest delight was in music He knew a smattering of it
scientifically enough to follow up subjects and to a certain extent
to recognize chords There occurs in one of his letters to me the
following passage which I venture to quote He is speaking of the
delight of pure sound as apart from melody
I remember once he writes being with a great organist in a
cathedral organloft sitting upon the bench at his side He was
playing a Mass of Schuberts and close to the end at the last chord
but twoahe was dying to a very soft close sliding in handles all
over the banks of stopsahe nodded with his head to the rows of pedal
stops with their red labels as though to indicate where danger
lay Put your hand on the thirtytwo foot he said There it
was Double open wood 32 ft And just as his fingers slid on to
the last chord Now he said
Ah that was it the great wooden pipe close to my ear began to blow
and quiver and hark not sound but sensationathe great rapturous
stir of the air a drowsy thunder in the roof of nave and choir the
grim saints stirred and rattled ill their leaded casements while
the melodious roar died away as softly as it had begun sinking to
silence with many a murmurous pulsation many a throb of sighing
sound
Organplaying organ music was the one subject on which I have heard
him wax enthusiastic His talk and his letters always become
rhetorical when he deals with music his musical metaphors are always
carefully worked out he compares a man of settled purpose in whose
life the motive was very apparent to the great lazy horns that
you can always hear in the orchestra pouring out their notes hollow
and sweet however loud the violins shiver or the trumpets cry He
often went up to London to hear music The St Jamess Hall Concerts
were his especial delight I find later a description of the effect
produced on him by Wagner
I have just come back from the Albert Hall from hearing the
MeistersAnger Wagner himself conducting I may safely say I
think that I never experienced such absolute artistic rapture before
as at certain parts of this for instance in the overture at one
place where the strings suddenly cease and there comes a peculiar
chromatic waft of wind instruments like a ghostly voice rushing
across I have never felt anything like it it swept one right away
and gave one a sense of deep ineffable satisfaction I shall always
feel for the future that there is an existent region into which
I have now actually penetrated in which that entire satisfaction
is possible a fact which I have always hitherto doubted It is
like an initiation
But I can not bear the TannhAuser it seems to paint with a
fatal fascination the beauty of wickedness the rightness so to
speak of sensuality I feel after it as if I had been yielding to
a luscious temptation unnerved not inspired
In another letter he writes Music is the most hopeful of the arts
she does not hint only like other expressions of beautyashe takes
you straight into a world of peace a world where law and beauty are
the same and where an ordered discord that is discord working by
definite laws is the origin of the keenest pleasure
I remember during the one London season which he subsequently went
through his settling himself at a Richter concert next me with an
air of delight upon his face Now he said let us try and
remember for an hour or two that we have souls
CHAPTER III
I must here record one curious circumstance which I have never
explained even to my own satisfaction
He had been at Cambridge about two years when in the common consent
of all his friends his habits and behaviour seemed to undergo a
complete and radical change
I have never discovered what the incident was that occasioned this
change all I know is that suddenly for several weeks his geniality
of manner and speech his hilarity his cheerfulness entirely
disappeared a curious look of haunting sadness not defined but
vague came over his face and though he gradually returned to his
old ways yet I am conscious myself and others would support me in
this that he was never quite the same again he was no longer young
The only two traces that I can discover in his journals or letters
or elsewhere of the facts are these
He always in later diaries vaguely alludes to a certain event which
changed his view of things in general ever since since that
November for now nearly five years I have felt These and similar
phrases constantly occur in his diary I will speak in a moment of
what nature I should conjecture it to have been
A packet of letters in his desk were marked to be burnt unopened
but at the same time carefully docketed with dates these dates were
all immediately after that time extending over ten days
The exact day was November 8 1872 It is engraved in a small silver
locket that hung on his watchchain where he was accustomed to have
important days in his life marked such as the day he adopted his
boy his mothers death It is preceded by the Greek letters II
which from a certain entry in his diary I conceive to be
Lastly in a diary for that year kept with fair regularity up till
November 8 there here intervenes a long blank the only entry being
November 9 Salvum me fac Dne
I took the trouble incidentally to hunt up the files of a Cambridge
journal of that date to see if I could link it on to any event and
I found there recorded in the course of that week what I at first
imagined to be the explanation of the incidents and own I was a good
deal surprised
I found recorded some Revivalist Mission Services which were then
held in Cambridge with great success I at once concluded that he
underwent some remarkable spiritual experience some religious
fright some socalled conversion the effects of which only
gradually disappeared The contagion of a Revivalist meeting is a
very mysterious thing Like a man going to a mesmerist an individual
may go announcing his firm intention not to be influenced in the
smallest degree by anything said or done Nay more he may think
himself and have the reputation of being a strong unyielding
character and yet these are the very men who are often most
hopelessly mesmerized the very men whom the Revival most
absolutelyafor the occasionaenslaves And thus knowing that one
could form no prima facie judgments on the probabilities in such a
matter I came to the conclusion that he had fallen in some degree
under the influence of these meetings
But in revising this book and carefully recalling my own and
studying others impressions I came to the conclusion that it was
impossible that this should be the case
1 In the first place he was more free than any man I ever saw from
the influence of contagious emotions he dissembled his own emotions
and contemned the public display of them in other people
2 He had I remember a strange repugnance even abhorrence to
public meetings in the later days at Cambridge I can now recall that
he would accompany people to the door but never be induced to enter
A passage which I will quote from one of his letters illustrates
this
The presence of a large number of people has a strange repulsive
physical effect on me I feel crushed and overwhelmed not stimulated
and vivified as is so often described I cant listen to a concert
comfortably if there is a great throng unless the music is so good
as to wrap one altogether away There is undoubtedly a force abroad
among large masses of people the force which forms the basis of the
principle of public prayer and I am conscious of it too only it
distresses me moreover the worst and most afflicting nightmare I
have is the sensation of standing sightless and motionless but with
all the other senses alert and apprehensive in the presence of a
vast and hostile crowd
3 He never showed the least sign of being influenced in the
direction of spiritual or even religious life by this crisis He
certainly spoke very little at all for some time to any one on any
subject he was distrait and absentminded in societyafor the
alteration was much observed from its suddennessabut when he
gradually began to converse as usual he did not as is so often the
case in similar circumstances do what is called bearing witness to
the truth His attitude toward all enthusiastic forms of religion
had been one in old days of goodnatured even amused tolerance He
was now not so goodnatured in his criticisms and less sparing of
them though his religiousmindedness his seriousness was
undoubtedly increased by the experience whatever it was
On the whole then I should say that the coincidence of the revival
is merely fortuitous It remains to seek what the cause was
We must look for it in a character so dignified as Arthurs in some
worthy cause some emotional failure some moral wound I believe the
following to be the clew I can not develop it without treading some
rather delicate ground
He had formed in his last year at school a very devoted friendship
with a younger boy such friendships like the Ia14III12a12III and the
a14IIa12I of Sparta when they are truly chivalrous and absolutely
pure are above all other loves noble refining true passion at white
heat without taint confidence of so intimate a kind as can not even
exist between husband and wife trust such as can not be shadowed
are its characteristics I speak from my own experience and others
will I know at heart confirm me when I say that these things are
infinitely rewarding unutterably dear
Arthur left Winchester A correspondence ensued between the two
friends I have three letters of Arthurs so passionate in
expression that for fear of even causing uneasiness not to speak
