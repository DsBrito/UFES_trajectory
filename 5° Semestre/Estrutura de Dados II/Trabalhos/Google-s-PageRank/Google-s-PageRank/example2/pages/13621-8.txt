POEMS OF JONATHAN SWIFT
POEMS ADDRESSED TO VANESSA AND STELLA
CADENUS AND VANESSA1
1713
The shepherds and the nymphs were seen
Pleading before the Cyprian queen
The counsel for the fair began
Accusing the false creature Man
The brief with weighty crimes was charged
On which the pleader much enlarged
That Cupid now has lost his art
Or blunts the point of every dart
His altar now no longer smokes
His mothers aid no youth invokes
This tempts freethinkers to refine
And bring in doubt their powers divine
Now love is dwindled to intrigue
And marriage grown a money league
Which crimes aforesaid with her leave
Were as he humbly did conceive
Against our sovereign ladys peace
Against the statute in that case
Against her dignity and crown
Then prayd an answer and sat down
The nymphs with scorn beheld their foes
When the defendants counsel rose
And what no lawyer ever lackd
With impudence ownd all the fact
But what the gentlest heart would vex
Laid all the fault on tother sex
That modern love is no such thing
As what those ancient poets sing
A fire celestial chaste refined
Conceived and kindled in the mind
Which having found an equal flame
Unites and both become the same
In different breasts together burn
Together both to ashes turn
But women now feel no such fire
And only know the gross desire
Their passions move in lower spheres
Whereer caprice or folly steers
A dog a parrot or an ape
Or some worse brute in human shape
Engross the fancies of the fair
The few soft moments they can spare
From visits to receive and pay
From scandal politics and play
From fans and flounces and brocades
From equipage and park parades
From all the thousand female toys
From every trifle that employs
The out or inside of their heads
Between their toilets and their beds
In a dull stream which moving slow
You hardly see the current flow
If a small breeze obstruct the course
It whirls about for want of force
And in its narrow circle gathers
Nothing but chaff and straws and feathers
The current of a female mind
Stops thus and turns with every wind
Thus whirling round together draws
Fools fops and rakes for chaff and straws
Hence we conclude no womens hearts
Are won by virtue wit and parts
Nor are the men of sense to blame
For breasts incapable of flame
The faults must on the nymphs be placed
Grown so corrupted in their taste
The pleader having spoke his best
Had witness ready to attest
Who fairly could on oath depose
When questions on the fact arose
That every article was true
Nor further those deponents knew
Therefore he humbly would insist
The bill might be with costs dismissd
The cause appeard of so much weight
That Venus from her judgment seat
Desired them not to talk so loud
Else she must interpose a cloud
For if the heavenly folks should know
These pleadings in the courts below
That mortals here disdain to love
She neer could show her face above
For gods their betters are too wise
To value that which men despise
And then said she my son and I
Must stroll in air twixt land and sky
Or else shut out from heaven and earth
Fly to the sea my place of birth
There live with daggled mermaids pent
And keep on fish perpetual Lent
But since the case appeard so nice
She thought it best to take advice
The Muses by the kings permission
Though foes to love attend the session
And on the right hand took their places
In order on the left the Graces
To whom she might her doubts propose
On all emergencies that rose
The Muses oft were seen to frown
The Graces half ashamed lookd down
And twas observed there were but few
Of either sex among the crew
Whom she or her assessors knew
The goddess soon began to see
Things were not ripe for a decree
And said she must consult her books
The lovers Fletas Bractons Cokes
First to a dapper clerk she beckond
To turn to Ovid book the second
She then referrd them to a place
In Virgil vide Didos case
As for Tibulluss reports
They never passd for law in courts
For Cowleys briefs and pleas of Waller
Still their authority was smaller
There was on both sides much to say
Shed hear the cause another day
And so she did and then a third
She heard itthere she kept her word
But with rejoinders or replies
Long bills and answers stuffd with lies
Demur imparlance and essoign
The parties neer could issue join
For sixteen years the cause was spun
And then stood where it first begun
Now gentle Clio sing or say
What Venus meant by this delay
The goddess much perplexd in mind
To see her empire thus declined
When first this grand debate arose
Above her wisdom to compose
Conceived a project in her head
To work her ends which if it sped
Would show the merits of the cause
Far better than consulting laws
In a glad hour Lucinas aid
Produced on earth a wondrous maid
On whom the Queen of Love was bent
To try a new experiment
She threw her lawbooks on the shelf
And thus debated with herself
Since men allege they neer can find
Those beauties in a female mind
Which raise a flame that will endure
For ever uncorrupt and pure
If tis with reason they complain
This infant shall restore my reign
Ill search where every virtue dwells
From courts inclusive down to cells
What preachers talk or sages write
These will I gather and unite
And represent them to mankind
Collected in that infants mind
This said she plucks in Heavens high bowers
A sprig of amaranthine flowers
In nectar thrice infuses bays
Three times refined in Titans rays
Then calls the Graces to her aid
And sprinkles thrice the newborn maid
From whence the tender skin assumes
A sweetness above all perfumes
From whence a cleanliness remains
Incapable of outward stains
From whence that decency of mind
So lovely in the female kind
Where not one careless thought intrudes
Less modest than the speech of prudes
Where never blush was calld in aid
That spurious virtue in a maid
A virtue but at secondhand
They blush because they understand
The Graces next would act their part
And showd but little of their art
Their work was half already done
The child with native beauty shone
The outward form no help required
Each breathing on her thrice inspired
That gentle soft engaging air
Which in old times adornd the fair
And said Vanessa be the name
By which thou shall be known to fame
Vanessa by the gods enrolld
Her name on earth shall not be told
But still the work was not complete
When Venus thought on a deceit
Drawn by her doves away she flies
And finds out Pallas in the skies
Dear Pallas I have been this morn
To see a lovely infant born
A boy in yonder isle below
So like my own without his bow
By beauty could your heart be won
Youd swear it is Apollos son
But it shall neer be said a child
So hopeful has by me been spoild
I have enough besides to spare
And give him wholly to your care
Wisdoms above suspecting wiles
The Queen of Learning gravely smiles
Down from Olympus comes with joy
Mistakes Vanessa for a boy
Then sows within her tender mind
Seeds long unknown to womankind
For manly bosoms chiefly fit
The seeds of knowledge judgment wit
Her soul was suddenly endued
With justice truth and fortitude
With honour which no breath can stain
Which malice must attack in vain
With open heart and bounteous hand
But Pallas here was at a stand
She knew in our degenerate days
Bare virtue could not live on praise
That meat must be with money bought
She therefore upon second thought
Infused yet as it were by stealth
Some small regard for state and wealth
Of which as she grew up there staid
A tincture in the prudent maid
She managed her estate with care
Yet liked three footmen to her chair
But lest he should neglect his studies
Like a young heir the thrifty goddess
For fear young master should be spoild
Would use him like a younger child
And after long computing found
Twould come to just five thousand pound
The Queen of Love was pleased and proud
To see Vanessa thus endowd
She doubted not but such a dame
Through every breast would dart a flame
That every rich and lordly swain
With pride would drag about her chain
That scholars would forsake their books
To study bright Vanessas looks
As she advanced that womankind
Would by her model form their mind
And all their conduct would be tried
By her as an unerring guide
Offending daughters oft would hear
Vanessas praise rung in their ear
Miss Betty when she does a fault
Lets fall her knife or spills the salt
Will thus be by her mother chid
Tis what Vanessa never did
Thus by the nymphs and swains adored
My power shall be again restored
And happy lovers bless my reign
So Venus hoped but hoped in vain
For when in time the Martial Maid
Found out the trick that Venus playd
She shakes her helm she knits her brows
And fired with indignation vows
Tomorrow ere the setting sun
Shed all undo that she had done
But in the poets we may find
A wholesome law time out of mind
Had been confirmd by Fates decree
That gods of whatsoeer degree
