1 Switzerland or a Journal of a Tour and Residence in that
country in 1817 1818 and 1819 By L Simond 2 vols 8 vo

Each valley has its appropriate stream proportioned to its length and
the number of lateral valleys opening into it The boisterous Lutschine
is the stream of Lauterbrun and it carries to the Lake of Brientz
scarcely less water than the Aar itself About half way between
Interlaken and Lauterbrun is the junction of the two Lutschines the
black and the white from the different substances with which they have
been in contact
Simond says after passing several falls of water each of which we
mistook for the Staubbach we came at last to the house where we were to
sleep It had taken us three hours to come thus far in twenty minutes
more we reached the heap of rubbish accumulated by degrees at the foot
of the Staubbach its waters descending from the height of the
Pletschberg form in their course several mighty cataracts and the last
but one is said to be the finest but is not readily accessible nor
seen at all from the valley The fall of the Staubbach about eight
hundred feet in height wholly detached from the rock is reduced into
vapour long before it reaches the ground the water and the vapour
undulating through the air with more grace and elegance than sublimity
While amusing ourselves with watching the singular appearance of rockets
of water shooting down into the dense cloud of vapour below we were
joined by some country girls who gave us a concert of three voices
pitched excessively high and more like the vibrations of metal or glass
than the human voice but in perfect harmony and although painful in
some degree yet very fine In winter an immense accumulation of ice
takes place at the foot of the Fall sometimes as much as three hundred
feet broad with two enormous icy stalactites hanging down over it When
heat returns the falling waters hollow out cavernous channels through
the mass the effect of which is said to be very fine this no doubt
is the proper season to see the Staubbach to most advantage Six or
eight miles further the valley ends in glaciers scarcely practicable
for chamois hunters About forty years since some miners who belonged to
the Valais and were at work at Lauterbrun undertook to cross over to
their own country simply to hear mass on a Sunday They traversed the
level top of the glacier in three hours then descended amidst the
greatest dangers its broken slope into the Valais and returned the day
after by the same way but no one else has since ventured on the
dangerous enterprise
Apart from the romantic attraction of the Fall the broadeaved chalet
and its accessaries form a truly interesting picture of village
simplicity and repose Here you are deemed rich with a capital of three
hundred pounds All that is not made in the country or of its growth
is deemed luxury a silver chain here as at Berne is transmitted from
mother to daughter Dwellings and barns covered with tiles and windows
with large panes of glass give to the owner a reputation of wealth and
if the outside walls are adorned with paintings and passages of
Scripture are inscribed on the front of the house the owner ranks at
once among the aristocracy of the country What an association of
primitive happiness do these humble attributes and characteristics of
Swiss scenery convey to the unambitious mind Think of this ye who
regard palaces as symbols of true enjoyment and ye who imprison
yourselves in overgrown cities and wear the silken fetters of wealth
and pridean aristocrat of Lauterbrun eclipses all your splendour and
a poor Swiss cottager in his humble chalet is richer than the
wealthiest of youfor he is content
PSALMODY
To the Editor of the Mirror
In my paper of the 22nd of August on this subject I promised to resume
it on my next coming to London which has been retarded by several
causes
In visiting the Churches of All Souls and Trinity the psalmody is by
no means to be praised It is chiefly by the charity children the
singing or rather noise is in their usual way and which will go on to
the end of time unless by the permission of the clergy some
intelligent instructors are allowed to lead as in the Chapel of St
James near Mornington Place in the Hampstead Road The author of the
paper on Music in your publication of the 6th of September very fairly
puts the question Why are not the English a musical people and he
shows many of the interrupting causes It may happen however that by
cultivating psalmody in our churches and chapels considerable progress
may be made The young will be instructed and the more advanced will
attend and we know the power of attention the only quality in
which Sir Isaac Newton could be persuaded to believe he had any one
advantage in intellect over his fellow men
It is much to be regretted that the poetry in which our Episcopal Psalms
and Hymns are sung is confined to the versions of Sternhold and
Hopkins and of Tate and Brady The poetry of Sternhold and Hopkins is
in general uncouth with some few exceptions Tate and Brady have made
their versification somewhat more congenial with the modern improvements
of our language but each confines himself to the very literal language
of the Old Testament Sternhold and Hopkins in this respect have the
advantage of their successors Tate and Brady for the translations of
Sternhold and Hopkins are nearer to the original Hebrew
The main object of my hope is that the version of the Psalms now in use
may be altered or rather improved in such a manner as to manifest
their prophetic and typical relation to Christianity to which in their
present form so little reference is to be perceived by those who should
read as they run A change or improvement in this respect would give a
more enlivening interest in Psalmody Dr Watts has done this with great
truth and effect and the singing in the churches and chapels in which
his version is in whole or in part introduced proceeds with a more
Christian spirit and a vast improvement has sprung from this source in
the sacred music of those churches and chapels
To illustrate this part of my paper let me refer to the version
employed in several of the new churches and to the version of Dr
Watts in the spiritual interpretation of the 4th Psalm In the version
first referred to the words are
The place of ancient sacrifice
Let righteousness supply
And let your hope securely fixd
On Him alone rely
Now in this version it naturally occurs to inquire what righteousness
The high churchman will content himself that it is a literal
translation but the wayfaring man sees nothing of the atoning
righteousness of Christ in this translation but which according to the
11th article of the Church of England he reasonably looks for Even
the Unitarians refer to this and other parts of our translation of the
Hebrew Psalms as a justification of THEIR main principle of the unity
alone in the godhead
Dr Watts a genuine Christian believing in the union of the Father
Son and Spirit and manifesting this pure faith to the end of a
wellspent life gives the Christian meaning of this righteousness in
his version of the 4th Psalm
Know that the Lord divides his Saints
From all the tribes of men beside
He hears the cry of penitents
For the dear sake of Christ who died
Here the true typical and prophetic meaning of the Old Testament is
given
The version used by the English church in the 5th Psalm is subject to
the same observation as on the 4th
The church version is
Thou in the morn shall hear my voice
And with the dawn of day
To thee devoutly I look up
To thee devoutly pray
Dr Watts who gives the Christian meaning of this Psalm translates or
paraphrases thus truly
Lord in the morning thou shall hear
My voice ascending high
To thee will I direct my prayr
To thee lift up mine eye
Up to the hills where Christ is gone
To plead for all his Saints
Presenting at his fathers throne
Our songs and our complaints
Psalmody or the singing of sacred music conducted by such a gracious
and animated sense of the revealed word of God must naturally be
performed as it must be ardently felt in a different spiritand this
truth we perceive daily verified but while a considerable portion of
our clergy not only are strict in confining the singing to the last
version or to parts of Sternhold and even prescribe the very dull
old tunes to be made use of improvement in church music is not to be
expected I have before me a list of tunes to which the organists of
our churches and episcopal chapels are limited in their playing and
what is singular three of the chief clergymen of the churches confess
they literally have no ear for music and are utter strangers to what an
octave means and yet their authority decides
It is not intended to enter into any polemical discussion as
controversy is not necessary to the improvement of psalmody but less
than has been stated would not have shown the advantage to be acquired
by the use of a more Christian sense to those who rely on Christ as
their Redeemer We know from experience how agreeable it is to the
mind and senses to hear the praises to the Almighty sung by the proper
rules of harmony and with what spiritual animation the upright and
sincere youth of both sexes unite in this delightful service
With these views I respectfully submit to the clergymen of the new
churches to pursue the course which receives such universal approbation
in St Jamess Chapel Morningtonplace Hampsteadroad The simplicity
and effect must be strong motives to excite their attention and I hope
to witness its adoption

THE THIEF
For the Mirror
I tell with equal truth and grief
That little Cs an arrant thief
Before the urchin well could go
She stole the whiteness of the snow
And morethat whiteness to adorn
She snatchd the blushes of the morn
Stole all the softness aether pours
On primrose buds in vernal showrs
Theres no repeating all her wiles
She stole the Graces winning smiles
Twas quickly seen she robbd the sky
To plant a star in either eye
She pilferd orient pearl for teeth
And suckd the cows ambrosial breath
The cherry steepd in morning dew
Gave moisture to her lips and hue
These were her infant spoils a store
To which in time she added more
At twelve she stole from Cyprus Queen
Her air and lovecommanding mien
Stole Junos dignity and stole
From Pallas sense to charm the soul
She sungamazd the Sirens heard
And to assert their voice appeard
She playd the Muses from their hill
Marvelld who thus had stole their skill
Apollos wit was next her prey
Her next the beam that lights the day
While Jove her pilferings to crown
Pronouncd these beauties all her own
Pardond her crimes and praisd her art
And tother day she stolemy heart
Cupid if lovers are thy care
Revenge thy votry on this fair
Do justice on her stolen charms
And let her prison bemy arms

SHAKSPEARE
To the Editor of the Mirror
In the Drama entitled Shakspeares Early Days the compliment which
the poet is made to pay the queen That as at her birth she wept when
all around was joy so at her death she will smile while all around is
grief has been admired by the critics In this jewelstealing age it
is but just to restore the little brilliant to its owner The following
lines are in Sir William Joness Life translated by him from one of the
Eastern poets and are so exquisitely beautiful that I think they will
be acceptable to some of your fair readers for their albums

Weeping thou satst while all around thee smild
So live that sinking to thy last long sleep

JT WALTER
Where are the lights that shone of yore
Around this haunted spring
Do they upon some distant shore
Their holy lustre fling
It was not thus when pilgrims came
To hymn beneath the night
And dimly gleamd the censors flame
When stars and streams were bright
What art thousince five hundred years
Have oer thy waters rolld
Since clouds have wept their crystal tears
From skies of beaming gold
Thy rills receive the tint of heaven
Which erst illumd thy shrine
And sweetest birds their songs have given
For music more divine
Beside thee hath the maiden kept
Her vigils pale and lone
While darkly have her ringlets swept
The chapels sculpturd stone
And when the vesperhymn was sung
Around the warriors bier
With cross and banner oer him hung
What splendour crownd thee here
But a cloud has falln upon thy fame
The woodman laves his brow
Where shrouded monks and vestals came
With many a sacred vow
And bluely gleams thy sainted spring
Beneath the sunny tree
Then let no heart its sadness bring
When Nature is with thee

THE SKETCHBOOK
WRECK ON A CORAL REEF
To the Editor of the Mirror
I take the liberty of transmitting you an authentic though somewhat
concise narrative of the loss of the Hon Companys regular ship
Cabalva on the Cargados Carajos in the Indian Seas in latitude
16 45 s in July 1818 no detailed account having hitherto appeared
The following was written by one of the surviving officers in a letter
to a friend
A CONSTANT READER
The Hon Companys ship Cabalva having struck on the Owers in the
English Channel and from that circumstance proving leaky and
manifesting great weakness in her frame it was thought advisable to
bear up for Bombay in order to dock the ship Meeting with a severe gale
of wind off the Cape in which we made twenty inches of water per
hour we parted from our consort and shaped a course for Bombay but
on the 7th of July between four and five AM the weather dark and
cloudy the ship going seven or eight knots an alarm was given of
breakers on the larboard bow the helm was instantly put hardaport
and the head sheets let go but before it could have the desired effect
she struck the shock was so violent that every person was instantly on
deck with horror and amazement depicted on their countenances An
effort was made to get the ship off but it was immediately seen that
all endeavours to save her must be useless she soon became fixed and
the sea broke over her with tremendous force stove in her weather side
making a clear passagewashed through the hatchways tearing up the
decks and all that opposed its violence
We were now uncertain of our distance from a place of safety the surf
burst over the vessel in a dreadful cascade the crew despairing and
clinging to her sides to avoid its violence while the ship was breaking
up with a rapidity and crashing noise which added to the roaring of the
breakers drowned the voices of the officers The masts were cut away to
ease the ship and the cutter cleared from the booms and launched from
the leegunwale When the long wishedfor dawn at last broke on us
instead of alleviating it rather added to our distress We found the
ship had run on the southeasternmost extremity of a coral reef
surrounding on the eastern side those sandbanks or islands in the
Indian ocean called Cargados Carajos the nearest of these was about
three miles distant but not the least appearance of verdure could be
discovered or the slightest trace of anything on which we might hope to
subsist In two or three places some pyramidical rocks appeared above
the rest like distant sails and were repeatedly cheered as such by the
crew till it was soon perceived they had no motion and the delusion
vanished The masts had fallen towards the reef the ship having
fortunately canted in that direction and the boat was thereby protected
in some measure from the surf Our commander whom a strong sense of
misfortune had entirely deprived of mind so necessary on these
occasions was earnestly requested to get into the boat but he would
not thinking her unsafe He maintained his station on the mizen
topmast that lay among the wreck to leeward the surf which was rushing
round the bow and stern continually overwhelming him I was myself close
to him on the same spar and in this situation we saw many of our
shipmates meet an untimely end being either dashed against the rocks or
swept over by the breakers The large cutter full of officers and men
now cleared a passage through the mass of wreck and being furnished
with oars watched the proper moment and pushed off for the reef which
she fortunately gained in safety they were all washed out of her in an
instant by a tremendous surf yet out of more than sixty which it
contained only one man was drowned Our captain seeing this wished he
had taken advice which was now of no use Finding I could not longer
maintain myself on the same spar and seeing the captain in a very
exhausted state I solicited him to return to the wreck but he replied
that since we must all eventually perish I should not think of his but
rather of my own preservation An enormous breaker now burst on us with
irresistible force so that I scarcely noticed what occurred to him
afterwards being buried by successive seas At length after the most
desperate efforts I was thrown on the reef half drowned and severely
cut by the sharp coral when I silently offered up thanks for my
preservation and crawling up the reef waved my hand to encourage those
who remained behind
The captain however was not to be seen and most of the others had
returned to the wreck and were employed in getting the small cutter into
the water which they accomplished and safely reached the shore About
noon when we had all left the ship she was a perfect wreck The whole
of the upper works from the after part of the forecastle to the break
of the poop deck had separated from her bottom about the upper
futtockheads and was driving in towards the reef Most of the lighter
cargo had floated out of her Bales of companys cloth cases of wine
puncheons of spirits barrels of gunpowder hogsheads of beer c lay
strewed on the shore together with a chest of tools Finding the men
beginning to commit the usual excesses we stove in the heads of the
spirit casks to prevent mischief and endeavoured to direct their
attention to the general benefit The tide was flowing fast and we saw
that the reef must soon be covered we therefore conveyed the boats to a
place of safety and filling them with all the provisions that could be
collected proceeded to the highest sandbank as the only place which
held out the remotest chance of security Our progress was attended with
the most excruciating pain I ever endured with feet cut to the bones by
the rocks and back blistered by the sunexhausted with fatigueup to
the waistsometimes to the neck in the water and frequently obliged
to swim Seeing however that several had reached the highest
sandbank lighted a fire and were employed in erecting a tent from the
cloth and small spars which had floated up I felt my spirits revive
and had strength sufficient to reach the desired spot when I was
invited to partake of a shark which had just been caught by the people
Having set a watch to announce the approach of the sea lest it should
cover us unawares I sunk exhausted on the sand and fell into a sound
sleep I awoke in the morning stiff with the exertions of the former
day yet feeling grateful to Providence that I was still alive
The people now collected together to ascertain who had perished when
sixteen were missing the captain surgeons assistant and fourteen of
the crew We divided the crew into parties each headed by an officer
some were sent to the wreck and along the beach in search of provisions
others to roll up the hogsheads of beer and butts of water that had
floated on shore but the greater number were employed in hauling the
two cutters up when the carpenters were directed to repair them
By the time it was dark we had collected about eighty pieces of salt
pork ten hogsheads of beer three butts of water several bottles of
wine and many articles of use and value particularly three sextants
and a quadrant Floresburgs Directory and Hamilton Moore the
latter were deemed inestimable In course of time four live pigs and
five live sheep came on shore through the surf
We first began upon the dead stock serving out two ounces to each and
half a pint of beer for the day Nothing but brackish water could be
obtained by digging in the sand We collected all the provisions
together near the tent and formed a kind of storehouse setting an
officer to guard them from plunder to which indeed some of the evil
characters were disposed but as they were threatened with instant death
if detected they were soon deterred The second night was passed like
the first all being huddled together under one large tent the more
robust however soon began to build separate tents for themselves and
divided into messes as on board A staff was next erected on which we
hoisted a red flag as a signal to any vessel which might be passing
Every morning to each mess was distributed the allowance of two ounces
per man and half a pint of beer if they got any thing else it was
what they could catch by fishing c Of fish indeed there was a great
variety but we had few facilities for catching them so that upon the
whole we were no better than halfstarved The bank on which we lived
was in latitude 16 45 s and about two miles in circumference at low
water the high tides would sometimes leave us scarcely half a mile of
sand and often approached close to the tents and if the wind had blown
from the westward or shifted only a few points we must inevitably have
been swept away as an encampment of fishermen had been a short time
previous from the same spot however Providence was pleased to preserve
us one hundred and twenty in number to return to our native country
On the 13th the largest boat was repaired and the officers thought it
advisable to despatch her for relief to the Isle of France distant
about four hundred miles The superior officers finding it impossible to
leave the crew dedicated the charge of her to the purser We furnished
him with two sextants a navigation book sails oars and log line Six
officers and eight men who perfectly understood the management of the
boat joined him He was directed to run first into the latitude and
then bear up for the land On the 17th he arrived at the Mauritius and
on the 20th returned by his Majestys vessels Magician and Challenger
On the 21st we were taken on board after being sixteen days on this
barren reef suffering great distress in mind and body We all received
the most humane attention from the captains of his Majestys vessels
and on the 28th we reached the Mauritius whence I returned to England
MANNERS  CUSTOMS OF ALL NATIONS
SINGING OF PSALMS
This has been a very ancient custom both among the Jews and Christians
St Paul mentions this practice which has continued in all succeeding
ages with some variations as to mode and circumstance for so long as
immediate inspiration lasted the preacher c frequently gave out a
hymn and when this ceased proper portions of scripture were selected
or agreeable hymns thereto composed but by the council of Laodicea it
was ordered that no private composition should be used in church the
council also ordered that the psalms should no longer be one continued
service but that proper lessons should be interposed to prevent the
people being tired At first the whole congregation bore a part singing
all together afterwards the manner was altered and they sung
alternately some repeating one verse and some another After the
emperors became Christians and persecution ceased singing grew much
more into use so that not only in the churches but also in private
houses the ancient music not being quite lost they diversified into
various sorts of harmony and altered into soft strong gay sad
grave or passionate c Choice was always made of that which agreed
with the majesty and purity of religion avoiding soft and effeminate
airs in some churches they ordered the psalms to be pronounced with so
small an alteration of voice that it was little more than plain
speaking like the reading of psalms in our cathedrals c at this day
but in process of time instrumental music was introduced first amongst
the Greeks
Pope Gregory the Great refined upon the church music and made it more
exact and harmonious and that it might be general he established
singing schools at Rome wherein persons were educated to be sent to the
distant churches and where it has remained ever since only among the
reformed there are various ways of performing and even in the same
church particularly that of England in which parish churches differ
much from cathedrals but most dissenters comply with this part of
worship in some form or other

SKIMINGTON RIDING
To the Editor of the Mirror
Having noticed a description of an exhibition called Skimington
Riding in the present volume of the MIRROR and your correspondent
being at a loss for the origin of such a title allow me to observe
that it appears to me that it originated from a skimmer being always
used as I have heard from very good authority it is as the leading
instrument towards making the various sounds usual on such occasions I
think it therefore very probable it took its rise from the utensil
skimmer and would be more properly called Skimmerting Riding

ANCIENT SUPERSTITION RESPECTING FELLING OAKS
In the Magna Britannia the author in his Account of the Hundred of
Croydon says Our historians take notice of two things in this
parish which may not be convenient to us to omit viz a great wood
called Norwood belonging to the archbishops wherein was anciently a
tree called the vicars oak where four parishes met as it were in a
point It is said to have consisted wholly of oaks and among them was
one that bore mistletoe which some persons were so hardy as to cut for
the gain of selling it to the apothecaries of London leaving a branch
of it to sprout out but they proved unfortunate after it for one of
them fell lame and others lost an eye At length in the year 1678 a
certain man notwithstanding he was warned against it upon the account
of what the others had suffered adventured to cut the tree down and he
soon after broke his leg To fell oaks hath long been counted fatal and
such as believe it produce the instance of the Earl of Winchelsea who
having felled a curious grove of oaks soon after found his countess
dead in her bed suddenly and his eldest son the Lord Maidstone was
killed at sea by a cannon ball
