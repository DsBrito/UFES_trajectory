Here it is
DEAR SIR I think that I have run across one of the most remarkable
coincidences in modern literature  But let me start at the beginning
I am by profession a wanderer upon the face of the earth  I have no
tradenor any other occupation
My father bequeathed me a competency some remoter ancestors lust to
roam  I have combined the two and invested them carefully and without
extravagance
I became interested in your story At the Earths Core not so much
because of the probability of the tale as of a great and abiding wonder
that people should be paid real money for writing such impossible
trash  You will pardon my candor but it is necessary that you
understand my mental attitude toward this particular storythat you
may credit that which follows
Shortly thereafter I started for the Sahara in search of a rather rare
species of antelope that is to be found only occasionally within a
limited area at a certain season of the year  My chase led me far from
the haunts of man
It was a fruitless search however in so far as antelope is concerned
but one night as I lay courting sleep at the edge of a little cluster
of datepalms that surround an ancient well in the midst of the arid
shifting sands I suddenly became conscious of a strange sound coming
apparently from the earth beneath my head
It was an intermittent ticking
No reptile or insect with which I am familiar reproduces any such
notes  I lay for an hourlistening intently
At last my curiosity got the better of me  I arose lighted my lamp
and commenced to investigate
My bedding lay upon a rug stretched directly upon the warm sand  The
noise appeared to be coming from beneath the rug  I raised it but
found nothingyet at intervals the sound continued
I dug into the sand with the point of my huntingknife  A few inches
below the surface of the sand I encountered a solid substance that had
the feel of wood beneath the sharp steel
Excavating about it I unearthed a small wooden box  From this
receptacle issued the strange sound that I had heard
How had it come here
What did it contain
In attempting to lift it from its burying place I discovered that it
seemed to be held fast by means of a very small insulated cable running
farther into the sand beneath it
My first impulse was to drag the thing loose by main strength but
fortunately I thought better of this and fell to examining the box  I
soon saw that it was covered by a hinged lid which was held closed by
a simple screwhook and eye
It took but a moment to loosen this and raise the cover when to my
utter astonishment I discovered an ordinary telegraph instrument
clicking away within
What in the world thought I is this thing doing here
That it was a French military instrument was my first guess but really
there didnt seem much likelihood that this was the correct
explanation when one took into account the loneliness and remoteness
of the spot
As I sat gazing at my remarkable find which was ticking and clicking
away there in the silence of the desert night trying to convey some
message which I was unable to interpret my eyes fell upon a bit of
paper lying in the bottom of the box beside the instrument  I picked
it up and examined it  Upon it were written but two letters
D I
They meant nothing to me then  I was baffled
Once in an interval of silence upon the part of the receiving
instrument I moved the sendingkey up and down a few times  Instantly
the receiving mechanism commenced to work frantically
I tried to recall something of the Morse Code with which I had played
as a little boybut time had obliterated it from my memory  I became
almost frantic as I let my imagination run riot among the possibilities
for which this clicking instrument might stand
Some poor devil at the unknown other end might be in dire need of
succor  The very franticness of the instruments wild clashing
betokened something of the kind
And there sat I powerless to interpret and so powerless to help
It was then that the inspiration came to me  In a flash there leaped
to my mind the closing paragraphs of the story I had read in the club
at Algiers
Does the answer lie somewhere upon the bosom of the broad Sahara at
the ends of two tiny wires hidden beneath a lost cairn
The idea seemed preposterous  Experience and intelligence combined to
assure me that there could be no slightest grain of truth or
possibility in your wild taleit was fiction pure and simple
And yet where WERE the other ends of those wires
What was this instrumentticking away here in the great Saharabut a
travesty upon the possible
Would I have believed in it had I not seen it with my own eyes
And the initialsD Iupon the slip of paper
Davids initials were theseDavid Innes
I smiled at my imaginings  I ridiculed the assumption that there was
an inner world and that these wires led downward through the earths
crust to the surface of Pellucidar  And yet
Well I sat there all night listening to that tantalizing clicking
now and then moving the sendingkey just to let the other end know that
the instrument had been discovered  In the morning after carefully
returning the box to its hole and covering it over with sand I called
my servants about me snatched a hurried breakfast mounted my horse
and started upon a forced march for Algiers
I arrived here today  In writing you this letter I feel that I am
making a fool of myself
There is no David Innes
There is no Dian the Beautiful
There is no world within a world
Pellucidar is but a realm of your imaginationnothing more
BUT
The incident of the finding of that buried telegraph instrument upon
the lonely Sahara is little short of uncanny in view of your story of
the adventures of David Innes
I have called it one of the most remarkable coincidences in modern
fiction  I called it literature before butagain pardon my
candoryour story is not
And nowwhy am I writing you
Heaven knows unless it is that the persistent clicking of that
unfathomable enigma out there in the vast silences of the Sahara has so
wrought upon my nerves that reason refuses longer to function sanely
I cannot hear it now yet I know that far away to the south all alone
beneath the sands it is still pounding out its vain frantic appeal
It is maddening
It is your faultI want you to release me from it
Cable me at once at my expense that there was no basis of fact for
your story At the Earths Core
Very respectfully yours
COGDON NESTOR
and  Club
Algiers
June 1st
Ten minutes after reading this letter I had cabled Mr Nestor as
follows
Story true  Await me Algiers
As fast as train and boat would carry me I sped toward my destination
For all those dragging days my mind was a whirl of mad conjecture of
frantic hope of numbing fear
The finding of the telegraphinstrument practically assured me that
David Innes had driven Perrys iron mole back through the earths crust
to the buried world of Pellucidar but what adventures had befallen him
since his return
Had he found Dian the Beautiful his halfsavage mate safe among his
friends or had Hooja the Sly One succeeded in his nefarious schemes to
abduct her
Did Abner Perry the lovable old inventor and paleontologist still
live
Had the federated tribes of Pellucidar succeeded in overthrowing the
mighty Mahars the dominant race of reptilian monsters and their
fierce gorillalike soldiery the savage Sagoths
I must admit that I was in a state bordering upon nervous prostration
when I entered the  and  Club in Algiers and inquired for Mr
Nestor  A moment later I was ushered into his presence to find myself
clasping hands with the sort of chap that the world holds only too few
of
He was a tall smoothfaced man of about thirty cleancut straight
and strong and weathertanned to the hue of a desert Arab  I liked
him immensely from the first and I hope that after our three months
together in the desert countrythree months not entirely lacking in
adventurehe found that a man may be a writer of impossible trash
and yet have some redeeming qualities
The day following my arrival at Algiers we left for the south Nestor
having made all arrangements in advance guessing as he naturally did
that I could be coming to Africa for but a single purposeto hasten at
once to the buried telegraphinstrument and wrest its secret from it
In addition to our native servants we took along an English
telegraphoperator named Frank Downes  Nothing of interest enlivened
our journey by rail and caravan till we came to the cluster of
datepalms about the ancient well upon the rim of the Sahara
It was the very spot at which I first had seen David Innes  If he had
ever raised a cairn above the telegraph instrument no sign of it
remained now  Had it not been for the chance that caused Cogdon Nestor
to throw down his sleeping rug directly over the hidden instrument it
might still be clicking there unheardand this story still unwritten
When we reached the spot and unearthed the little box the instrument
was quiet nor did repeated attempts upon the part of our telegrapher
succeed in winning a response from the other end of the line  After
several days of futile endeavor to raise Pellucidar we had begun to
despair  I was as positive that the other end of that little cable
protruded through the surface of the inner world as I am that I sit
here today in my studywhen about midnight of the fourth day I was
awakened by the sound of the instrument
Leaping to my feet I grasped Downes roughly by the neck and dragged him
out of his blankets  He didnt need to be told what caused my
excitement for the instant he was awake he too heard the longhoped
for click and with a whoop of delight pounced upon the instrument
Nestor was on his feet almost as soon as I The three of us huddled
about that little box as if our lives depended upon the message it had
for us
Downes interrupted the clicking with his sendingkey  The noise of the
receiver stopped instantly
Ask who it is Downes I directed
He did so and while we awaited the Englishmans translation of the
reply I doubt if either Nestor or I breathed
He says hes David Innes said Downes  He wants to know who we are
Tell him said I and that we want to know how he isand all that
has befallen him since I last saw him
For two months I talked with David Innes almost every day and as
Downes translated either Nestor or I took notes  From these arranged
in chronological order I have set down the following account of the
further adventures of David Innes at the earths core practically in
his own words
CHAPTER I
LOST ON PELLUCIDAR
The Arabs of whom I wrote you at the end of my last letter Innes
began and whom I thought to be enemies intent only upon murdering me
proved to be exceedingly friendlythey were searching for the very
band of marauders that had threatened my existence  The huge
rhamphorhynchuslike reptile that I had brought back with me from the
inner worldthe ugly Mahar that Hooja the Sly One had substituted for
my dear Dian at the moment of my departurefilled them with wonder and
with awe
Nor less so did the mighty subterranean prospector which had carried me
to Pellucidar and back again and which lay out in the desert about two
miles from my camp
With their help I managed to get the unwieldy tons of its great bulk
into a vertical positionthe nose deep in a hole we had dug in the
sand and the rest of it supported by the trunks of datepalms cut for
the purpose
It was a mighty engineering job with only wild Arabs and their wilder
mounts to do the work of an electric cranebut finally it was
completed and I was ready for departure
For some time I hesitated to take the Mahar back with me  She had been
docile and quiet ever since she had discovered herself virtually a
prisoner aboard the iron mole It had been of course impossible for
me to communicate with her since she had no auditory organs and I no
knowledge of her fourthdimension sixthsense method of communication
Naturally I am kindhearted and so I found it beyond me to leave even
this hateful and repulsive thing alone in a strange and hostile world
The result was that when I entered the iron mole I took her with me
That she knew that we were about to return to Pellucidar was evident
for immediately her manner changed from that of habitual gloom that had
pervaded her to an almost human expression of contentment and delight
Our trip through the earths crust was but a repetition of my two
former journeys between the inner and the outer worlds  This time
however I imagine that we must have maintained a more nearly
perpendicular course for we accomplished the journey in a few minutes
less time than upon the occasion of my first journey through the
fivehundredmile crust  Just a trifle less than seventytwo hours
after our departure into the sands of the Sahara we broke through the
surface of Pellucidar
Fortune once again favored me by the slightest of margins for when I
opened the door in the prospectors outer jacket I saw that we had
missed coming up through the bottom of an ocean by but a few hundred
yards
The aspect of the surrounding country was entirely unfamiliar to meI
had no conception of precisely where I was upon the one hundred and
twentyfour million square miles of Pellucidars vast land surface
The perpetual midday sun poured down its torrid rays from zenith as it
had done since the beginning of Pellucidarian timeas it would
continue to do to the end of it  Before me across the wide sea the
weird horizonless seascape folded gently upward to meet the sky until
it lost itself to view in the azure depths of distance far above the
level of my eyes
How strange it looked How vastly different from the flat and puny area
of the circumscribed vision of the dweller upon the outer crust
I was lost  Though I wandered ceaselessly throughout a lifetime I
might never discover the whereabouts of my former friends of this
strange and savage world  Never again might I see dear old Perry nor
Ghak the Hairy One nor Dacor the Strong One nor that other infinitely
precious onemy sweet and noble mate Dian the Beautiful
But even so I was glad to tread once more the surface of Pellucidar
Mysterious and terrible grotesque and savage though she is in many of
her aspects I can not but love her  Her very savagery appealed to me
for it is the savagery of unspoiled Nature
The magnificence of her tropic beauties enthralled me Her mighty land
areas breathed unfettered freedom
Her untracked oceans whispering of virgin wonders unsullied by the eye
of man beckoned me out upon their restless bosoms
Not for an instant did I regret the world of my nativity  I was in
Pellucidar  I was home  And I was content
As I stood dreaming beside the giant thing that had brought me safely
through the earths crust my traveling companion the hideous Mahar
emerged from the interior of the prospector and stood beside me  For a
long time she remained motionless
What thoughts were passing through the convolutions of her reptilian
brain
I do not know
She was a member of the dominant race of Pellucidar  By a strange
freak of evolution her kind had first developed the power of reason in
that world of anomalies
To her creatures such as I were of a lower order  As Perry had
discovered among the writings of her kind in the buried city of Phutra
it was still an open question among the Mahars as to whether man
possessed means of intelligent communication or the power of reason
Her kind believed that in the center of allpervading solidity there
was a single vast spherical cavity which was Pellucidar  This
cavity had been left there for the sole purpose of providing a place
for the creation and propagation of the Mahar race  Everything within
it had been put there for the uses of the Mahar
I wondered what this particular Mahar might think now  I found
pleasure in speculating upon just what the effect had been upon her of
passing through the earths crust and coming out into a world that one
of even less intelligence than the great Mahars could easily see was a
different world from her own Pellucidar
What had she thought of the outer worlds tiny sun
What had been the effect upon her of the moon and myriad stars of the
clear African nights
How had she explained them
With what sensations of awe must she first have watched the sun moving
slowly across the heavens to disappear at last beneath the western
horizon leaving in his wake that which the Mahar had never before
witnessedthe darkness of night For upon Pellucidar there is no
night  The stationary sun hangs forever in the center of the
Pellucidarian skydirectly overhead
Then too she must have been impressed by the wondrous mechanism of
the prospector which had bored its way from world to world and back
again  And that it had been driven by a rational being must also have
occurred to her
Too she had seen me conversing with other men upon the earths
surface  She had seen the arrival of the caravan of books and arms
and ammunition and the balance of the heterogeneous collection which I
had crammed into the cabin of the iron mole for transportation to
Pellucidar
She had seen all these evidences of a civilization and brainpower
transcending in scientific achievement anything that her race had
produced nor once had she seen a creature of her own kind
There could have been but a single deduction in the mind of the
Maharthere were other worlds than Pellucidar and the gilak was a
rational being
Now the creature at my side was creeping slowly toward the nearby sea
At my hip hung a longbarreled sixshootersomehow I had been unable
to find the same sensation of security in the newfangled automatics
that had been perfected since my first departure from the outer
worldand in my hand was a heavy express rifle
I could have shot the Mahar with ease for I knew intuitively that she
was escapingbut I did not
I felt that if she could return to her own kind with the story of her
adventures the position of the human race within Pellucidar would be
advanced immensely at a single stride for at once man would take his
proper place in the considerations of the reptilia
At the edge of the sea the creature paused and looked back at me  Then
she slid sinuously into the surf
For several minutes I saw no more of her as she luxuriated in the cool
depths
Then a hundred yards from shore she rose and there for another short
while she floated upon the surface
Finally she spread her giant wings flapped them vigorously a score of
times and rose above the blue sea  A single time she circled far
aloftand then straight as an arrow she sped away
I watched her until the distant haze enveloped her and she had
disappeared  I was alone
My first concern was to discover where within Pellucidar I might
beand in what direction lay the land of the Sarians where Ghak the
Hairy One ruled
But how was I to guess in which direction lay Sari
And if I set out to searchwhat then
Could I find my way back to the prospector with its priceless freight
of books firearms ammunition scientific instruments and still more
booksits great library of reference works upon every conceivable
branch of applied sciences
And if I could not of what value was all this vast storehouse of
potential civilization and progress to be to the world of my adoption
Upon the other hand if I remained here alone with it what could I
accomplish singlehanded
Nothing
But where there was no east no west no north no south no stars no
moon and only a stationary midday sun how was I to find my way back
to this spot should ever I get out of sight of it
I didnt know
For a long time I stood buried in deep thought when it occurred to me
to try out one of the compasses I had brought and ascertain if it
remained steadily fixed upon an unvarying pole  I reentered the
prospector and fetched a compass without
Moving a considerable distance from the prospector that the needle
might not be influenced by its great bulk of iron and steel I turned
the delicate instrument about in every direction
Always and steadily the needle remained rigidly fixed upon a point
straight out to sea apparently pointing toward a large island some ten
or twenty miles distant  This then should be north
I drew my notebook from my pocket and made a careful topographical
sketch of the locality within the range of my vision  Due north lay
the island far out upon the shimmering sea
The spot I had chosen for my observations was the top of a large flat
boulder which rose six or eight feet above the turf  This spot I
called Greenwich  The boulder was the Royal Observatory
I had made a start I cannot tell you what a sense of relief was
imparted to me by the simple fact that there was at least one spot
within Pellucidar with a familiar name and a place upon a map
It was with almost childish joy that I made a little circle in my
notebook and traced the word Greenwich beside it
Now I felt I might start out upon my search with some assurance of
finding my way back again to the prospector
I decided that at first I would travel directly south in the hope that
I might in that direction find some familiar landmark  It was as good
a direction as any  This much at least might be said of it
Among the many other things I had brought from the outer world were a
number of pedometers  I slipped three of these into my pockets with
the idea that I might arrive at a more or less accurate mean from the
registrations of them all
On my map I would register so many paces south so many east so many
west and so on  When I was ready to return I would then do so by any
route that I might choose
I also strapped a considerable quantity of ammunition across my
shoulders pocketed some matches and hooked an aluminum frypan and a
small stewkettle of the same metal to my belt
I was readyready to go forth and explore a world
Ready to search a land area of 124110000 square miles for my friends
my incomparable mate and good old Perry
And so after locking the door in the outer shell of the prospector I
set out upon my quest  Due south I traveled across lovely valleys
thickdotted with grazing herds
Through dense primeval forests I forced my way and up the slopes of
mighty mountains searching for a pass to their farther sides
Ibex and musksheep fell before my good old revolver so that I lacked
not for food in the higher altitudes  The forests and the plains gave
plentifully of fruits and wild birds antelope aurochsen and elk
Occasionally for the larger game animals and the gigantic beasts of
prey I used my express rifle but for the most part the revolver
filled all my needs
There were times too when faced by a mighty cave bear a
sabertoothed tiger or huge felis spelaea blackmaned and terrible
even my powerful rifle seemed pitifully inadequatebut fortune favored
me so that I passed unscathed through adventures that even the
recollection of causes the short hairs to bristle at the nape of my
neck
How long I wandered toward the south I do not know for shortly after I
left the prospector something went wrong with my watch and I was again
at the mercy of the baffling timelessness of Pellucidar forging
steadily ahead beneath the great motionless sun which hangs eternally
at noon
I ate many times however so that days must have elapsed possibly
months with no familiar landscape rewarding my eager eyes
I saw no men nor signs of men  Nor is this strange for Pellucidar in
its land area is immense while the human race there is very young and
consequently far from numerous
Doubtless upon that long search mine was the first human foot to touch
the soil in many placesmine the first human eye to rest upon the
gorgeous wonders of the landscape
It was a staggering thought  I could not but dwell upon it often as I
made my lonely way through this virgin world  Then quite suddenly
one day I stepped out of the peace of manless primality into the
presence of manand peace was gone
It happened thus
I had been following a ravine downward out of a chain of lofty hills
and had paused at its mouth to view the lovely little valley that lay
before me  At one side was tangled wood while straight ahead a river
wound peacefully along parallel to the cliffs in which the hills
terminated at the valleys edge
Presently as I stood enjoying the lovely scene as insatiate for
Natures wonders as if I had not looked upon similar landscapes
countless times a sound of shouting broke from the direction of the
woods  That the harsh discordant notes rose from the throats of men I
could not doubt
I slipped behind a large boulder near the mouth of the ravine and
waited  I could hear the crashing of underbrush in the forest and I
guessed that whoever came came quicklypursued and pursuers doubtless
In a short time some hunted animal would break into view and a moment
later a score of halfnaked savages would come leaping after with
spears or club or great stoneknives
I had seen the thing so many times during my life within Pellucidar
that I felt that I could anticipate to a nicety precisely what I was
about to witness  I hoped that the hunters would prove friendly and be
able to direct me toward Sari
Even as I was thinking these thoughts the quarry emerged from the
forest  But it was no terrified fourfooted beast  Instead what I
saw was an old mana terrified old man
Staggering feebly and hopelessly from what must have been some very
terrible fate if one could judge from the horrified expressions he
continually cast behind him toward the wood he came stumbling on in my
direction
He had covered but a short distance from the forest when I beheld the
first of his pursuersa Sagoth one of those grim and terrible
gorillamen who guard the mighty Mahars in their buried cities faring
forth from time to time upon slaveraiding or punitive expeditions
against the human race of Pellucidar of whom the dominant race of the
inner world think as we think of the bison or the wild sheep of our own
world
Close behind the foremost Sagoth came others until a full dozen raced
shouting after the terrorstricken old man  They would be upon him
shortly that was plain
One of them was rapidly overhauling him his backthrown speararm
testifying to his purpose
And then quite with the suddenness of an unexpected blow I realized a
past familiarity with the gait and carriage of the fugitive
Simultaneously there swept over me the staggering fact that the old man
wasPERRY That he was about to die before my very eyes with no hope
that I could reach him in time to avert the awful catastrophefor to
me it meant a real catastrophe
Perry was my best friend
Dian of course I looked upon as more than friend  She was my matea
part of me
I had entirely forgotten the rifle in my hand and the revolvers at my
belt one does not readily synchronize his thoughts with the stone age
and the twentieth century simultaneously
Now from past habit I still thought in the stone age and in my
thoughts of the stone age there were no thoughts of firearms
The fellow was almost upon Perry when the feel of the gun in my hand
awoke me from the lethargy of terror that had gripped me  From behind
my boulder I threw up the heavy express riflea mighty engine of
destruction that might bring down a cave bear or a mammoth at a single
shotand let drive at the Sagoths broad hairy breast
At the sound of the shot he stopped stockstill  His spear dropped
from his hand
Then he lunged forward upon his face
The effect upon the others was little less remarkable  Perry alone
could have possibly guessed the meaning of the loud report or explained
its connection with the sudden collapse of the Sagoth  The other
gorillamen halted for but an instant  Then with renewed shrieks of
rage they sprang forward to finish Perry
At the same time I stepped from behind my boulder drawing one of my
revolvers that I might conserve the more precious ammunition of the
express rifle  Quickly I fired again with the lesser weapon
Then it was that all eyes were directed toward me  Another Sagoth fell
to the bullet from the revolver but it did not stop his companions
They were out for revenge as well as blood now and they meant to have
both
As I ran forward toward Perry I fired four more shots dropping three
of our antagonists  Then at last the remaining seven wavered  It was
too much for them this roaring death that leaped invisible upon them
