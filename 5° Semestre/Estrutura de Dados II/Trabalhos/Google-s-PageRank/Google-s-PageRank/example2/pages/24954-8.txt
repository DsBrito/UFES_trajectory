racehorse galloping past a trotting donkey She presented a beautiful
sight as she swept by with yards braced up sharp to a good southeast
breeze and every stitch of her brandnew canvas drawing One of the
officers had the bad manners to take up a coil of small line and make
a pretence of heaving it to us for a tow rope Rosser looked on with an
unmoved face though our own mate made some strong remarks
Guess its that champagne hes drunk was all that Rosser said as he
turned away and I have no doubt he was right for we afterwards learned
that nearly every one aft on board the brigantine was halfdrunk when
she lifted anchor the visitors having brought on board half a dozen
cases of champagneas a matter of fact we had seen the steward opening
bottles on the poop In an hour the Tuitoga was a long way ahead
Rosser said to us at dinner
That brigantine will come to grief Shes overmasted and the fellow
who has her ought not to be trusted with her Hes going to make a mess
of things
Then in his slow drawling manner he told us that the command of
the Tuitoga had been given to an exlieutenant of the navy whose
knowledge of sailing vessels was confined to his youthful experiences on
one of the service training brigs but King George of Tonga was anxious
to secure an English naval officer to command the new ship and out of
some hundreds of eager applicants Lieutenant Raye had been selected
By sundown the brigantine was hull down ahead of us though the barque
was a very smart vessel and we were then making eleven knots At
midnight I heard the mate give orders to take in royals and topgallant
sails and going on deck found the wind had almost died away
Rosser was on deck and told me that we were going to get it hot from
the NE before long and by four in the morning we were under topsails
and lower courses only the ship flying before a most unpleasant sea I
turned in again and slept till daylight when the second mate gave me a
call
Come on deck and see something pretty
The something pretty was the brigantine which was in sight about a
mile away on our lee bow She was in a terrible mess Her fore and main
royal masts and topgallant masts and jibboom had apparently all been
carried away together and she was almost lying on her beam ends We ran
down to her and saw that her crew were busy in cutting away the spars
and sails alongside All her boats were gone and her forard deck house
had started and was working to and fro with every sea
In less than half an hour the mate and six hands from the barque were
on board assisting the crew cutting away the wire rigging and trimming
the cargo the shifting of which had nearly sent her to the bottom I
went with the boat to lend a hand and the second mate of the brigantine
told me that the young captain had refused to listen to the mates
suggestion to shorten sail when the officer told him that the wind
would certainly come away suddenly from the NE The consequence was
that a furious squall took her aback and had not the jibboomand then
the upper sparscarried away under the terrific strain she would have
gone to the bottom The worst part of the business was that two poor
seamen had been lost overboard
Hes a pretty kind of man for a skipper if you like said the
second officer bitterly He ought to be hanged for pretending hes
a sailorman Its sheer murder to put such a jackass in command of a
deepwater sailing ship
After rendering all possible assistance to the brigantine we left her
about midday and had been lying at anchor for two weeks in Nukualofa
Harbour before she put in an appearance outside the reef A native pilot
went out in a canoe but the captain haughtily declined his services
and would not even let him come on boardhe wanted to show people that
although he had never seen Naknalofa Harbour before he could bring
his ship in without a pilot In less than half an hour a swirling eddy
caught the vessel and earned her broadside on to the reef where she
would have been battered to pieces had not our two boats gone to her
assistance and with great difficulty got her off again Captain Rosser
several times countermanded orders given by his chief officeran
experienced seamanand bullied and jawed his crew in the most pompous
and irritating manner and finally when we succeeded in getting the
vessel off the reef with the loss of her false keel and rudder and
were towing her into smooth water inside the reef he came forard and
abruptly desired our chief mate to cease towing as he meant to anchor
Anchor and be hanged to you replied our officer with angry contempt
the kind of ship you ought to command is one that is towed by a horse
along a path in the old country
We cast off and left him to his own conceit and devices He let go in
less than five fathoms paid out too much cable and went stern first
on to a coral patch where he stuck for a couple of days much to our
delight
Within six months this gentleman succeeded in getting the brigantine
ashore on four occasions and she had to return to Sydney to be repaired
at a cost of 1700
My next two experiences were with the pigheaded type I had made an
agreement with the master of a Fijiowned vesselalso a brigantineto
convey myself and my stock of trade goods from an island in the Tokelau
or Union Group South Pacific to Yap in the Caroline Islands in the
Northwest where I intended starting a trading business This captain
was as good a seaman as ever trod a deck and had had a rather long
experience of the island trade but a mule could not surpass him in
obstinacy as I was soon to learn to my sorrow
A week after leaving the Tokelaus we dropped anchor on the edge of the
reef of one of the Gilbert Group to land supplies for a trader living
there The coast was very exposed to all but an easterly wind and
neither the mate nor myself liked the idea of anchoring at all The
skipper however brought his vessel close in to the roaring breakers
on the reef let go his anchor in six fathoms and then neatly backed
astern into blue water sixty fathoms deep Here we lay apparently safe
enough for the time the wind being easterly and steady
By sunset we had finished landing stores and shipping cargo and when
the captain came off in the last boat we naturally expected him to
heave up and get out of such a dangerous place but to our surprise he
remarked carelessly that as the men were very tired he would hold on
until daylight
I wouldnt risk it if I were you said the trader who had come aboard
in his own boat to square up You cant depend on this easterly
breeze holding all night and it may come on squally from the west or
southwest in a few hours and take you unawares
Bosh was the reply Hoist the boats up Mr Laird and tell the men
to get supper
Very well sir replied the mate none too cheerfully
Just as the trader was going ashore he said to me aside quietly This
little monkeyfaced skipper is a blazing idiot our captain was a very
very little man I told him again just now that if the wind comes
away from west or southwest or even if it falls calm hell find hes
caught to a dead certainty But he as good as told me to mind my own
business
Naturally enough I was anxious I had on board trade goods which had
cost 1100 and of course had not one penny of insurance on them The
brigantine however was well insured though I do not impute this fact
as being the cause of the captains neglect of a sensible warning
After supper the captain turned in while the mate and I both feeling
very uneasy paced the deck till about nine oclock at which hour the
wind had become perceptibly lighter and the captain was called He came
on deck trotted up and down in his pyjamas for a few minutes sat on
the rail like a monkey on a fence and then asked the mate snappishly
what he was scared about
The mate made no reply and the captain was just going below again when
two fishing canoes with four natives in each came quite near us both
heading for the shore and the skipper asked me to hail them and see if
they had any fish to sell I did so
No was the reply we are going back again because much rain and
wind is coming from the westward and we want to get over the reef
before the surf becomes too great Then one of them stood up and
added
Why does not the ship go away quickly This is a very bad place here
when the wind and the sea come from the west Your ship will be broken
to pieces
What do they say inquired the little man
I translated what they had said
Bosh I say again was the reply the glass has been as steady as a
rock for the past three days and then to my intense anger he added
an insinuation that my fears had led me to deliberately misinterpret
what the natives had said The retort I made was of so practical a
nature that the mate had to assist the skipper to his feet
A quarter of an hour later as the mate and I still walked the deck
discussing the captains shortcomings the wind died away suddenly and
then several of our native crew came aft and said that a squall was
coming up from the westward and the mate though neither he nor myself
could then see any sign of it went below and again called the captain
He came on deck with one hand covering his injured left optic told
me he would settle with me in the morning and then took a long look
astern and there certainly enough was a long streak of black rising
over the horizon The mate stood by waiting his orders
Its not coming near us said the little man more snappishly than
ever as he marched up and down the poop
I say it is said Laird bluntly and I consider this ship will be
ashore if we dont slip and tow out a bit before it is too late
The mates manner had some effect on the obstinate little animalOh
well if theres such a lot of old women on board Ill give in Call
the hands and well heave up
Heave up echoed the mate in angry astonishment whats the use of
trying to heave up now That squall will be on us in ten minutes and
if we had an hour to spare it would be none too long Why man its
a dead calm and the swell will send us into the surf on the reef quick
enough without our dragging the ship into it Reckon the best and only
thing we can do is down boats and then slip cable rightaway We might
get a show then to lay along the reef and get clear
Im not going to lose a new cable and anchor to please any one was
the stupid reply He could very easily have recovered both anchor and
cable with the assistance of the natives on the following day or indeed
months after
Then he sang out to the men to man the windlass
The hands realising the danger turned to with a will but within five
minutes the first breath of the squall caught us and sent us ahead
as was evident by the way the slackened cable came in through the
hawsepipe
We had out fiftyfive fathoms of chain and before twentyfive were in
the squall was upon us properly the brigantine went gracefully ahead
overran her anchor plunged into the roaring breakers on the reef and
struck bows on
In another moment or two a heavy sea caught her on the starboard
quarter canted her round and dashed her broadside on to the reef with
terrific violence Then fortunately for our lives two or three further
rollers sent her crashing along till she brought up against two or
three coral boulders whose tops were revealed every now and then by the
backwash In less than twenty minutes she was hopelessly bilged and her
decks swept by every sea
We carried three boats and our native sailors showed their pluck and
skill by actually getting all three safely into the water two on the
lee side and one on the other
The captain now conscious of his folly became very modest and gave
his orders quietly The crew however took no notice of him and looked
to the mate He the captain ordered me into the first boat in which
were the ships papers charts chronometer c I refused and said I
preferred getting on shore in my own way
I had seen that two native boys passengers had run out on to the
bowsprit and watching their chance had dropped over into a curling
roller and were carried safely ashore
I had with me on board about nine hundred silver Mexican and Chili
dollarssome in a cash box the rest in a bag Calling my native
servant Levi I asked him if he thought all the boats would get ashore
safely He shook his head said that it was doubtful and that it would
be better for me to throw the bag and the cash box over the lee side
where they were pretty sure to be recovered in the morning at low tide
All the boats will capsize or get stove in going over the reef or
else will be smashed to bits on the shore he said and the natives
will steal everything they can lay their hands on especially if the
white men are drowned So it is better to throw the money overboard
I took his advice and going on deck we dropped both box and bag
overboard just where Levi pointed out a big boulder against which the
brigantine was crushing and pounding her quarter
Again refusing to enter any of the boats I watched my chance and ran
forard followed by Levi and as soon as a big roller came along we
dropped and were carried ashore beautifully Some hundreds of natives
and the white trader were on the look out and ran in and caught us
before the backwash carried us out again
The mates boat had already reached the shore without accident owing to
the splendid manner in which he and his native crew had handled her but
both the captain and second mate came to grief their boats broaching to
and capsizing just as they were within a few fathoms of the shore
However no lives were lost and although next morning the brigantines
decks had worked out of her and came ashore the hull held together for
some weeks and we saved a lot of stores My money I recovered two or
three days later though it had been carried more than a hundred yards
away from the spot where it had been dropped overboard The tin cashbox
which I had tied up in an oilskin coat parcelled round with spun yarn
and weighted inside with several hundred Snider cartridges was found
buried in sand and broken coral in a small pool on the reef it
presented a most curious appearance being almost round in shape The
canvas bag was found near by under a ledge of the reef together with
the binnacle bellwhich was doubled flatand a dinner plate The
bag of No 2 canvas had been hastily rolled up by Levi in the cabin
tablecloth weighted with all the loose Snider cartridges we could find
in the darkened trade room and tied up at each end like a rolypoly
This proved its salvation for when we dug it out under three fathoms
of water the outer covering came away in fine shreds and some of the
big Mexican sun dollars had cut through the canvas
So ended my second experience and the only satisfactory thing about it
to me after losing over a thousand pounds worth of goods through the
captains obstinacy was that when he was fussing about after the wreck
trying to get one of the anchors ashore he managed to lose his right
forefinger I regret to say that whilst I dressed the stump and bound up
his hand for him I could not help telling him that I was sorry it was
not his head that had been knocked offprevious to our going ashore
Twas very unchristianlike but I was very sore with the man for his
pigheadedness and then he so bewailed the loss of his finger never
thinking of the fact that the boatswain had all but lost an eye but had
never even murmured at his hard luck
My third experience of a pigheaded master mariner followed very
quicklyso quickly that I began to think some evil star attended my
fortunes or rather misfortunes
After living on the island for three months after the loss of the
brigantine two vessels arrived on the same dayone a schooner
belonging to San Francisco and bound to that port the other the
George Noble a fine handsome barquentine bound to Sydney Now it
would have suited me very well to go to California in the schooner
but finding that the skipper of the wrecked brigantine had arranged
for passages for himself officers and crew in her I decided togo to
Sydney in the George Noble purely because the little man with the
missing finger had become so objectionable to mebrooding over my
losses and wondering how I could pay my debtsthat I felt I could
not possibly remain at close quarters with the man in a small schooner
without taking a thousand pounds worth of damage out of him during the
voyage which taking out process might land me in a gaol with two
years imprisonment to serve So I bade goodbye to good mate Laird and
the boatswain with the injured eye and the native crew who had acted so
gallantly and then with Levi standing by my side holding my ponderous
bag of my beloved Mexican dollars in one hand and a few articles of
clothing in the other I told Captain  that I considered him to
be an anthropoid ape an old washerwoman and a person who should be
generally despised and rejected by all people even those of the dullest
intellects such as those of the members of the firm who employed him
And then recalling to my memory the sarcastic remark of the mate of the
Rimitara to the pompous captain of the Tuitoga about the command
of a canal boat I wound up by adding that he had missed his vocation
in life and instead of being skipper of a smart brigantine he
was intended by Providence to be captain of a muddredge for which
position however he had probably barely sufficient intelligence
Feeling very despondentfor I had but nine hundred Mexican and Chilian
dollars to meet a debt of eleven hundred pounds and had out of this to
keep myself and servant for perhaps six months until I got another start
as a trader I went on board the George Noble and bargained with her
captain for a passage to Sydney at which port I knew I could at once
meet with an engagement
The captain of the George Noble was a very decent and goodnatured
German named Evers He agreed to take me and my henchman to Sydney for
125 dollarsI to live aft the boy to go forard with the sailors and
lend a hand in working the ship if called upon in an emergency The
vessel I found was owned by a firm of Chinese merchants in Sydney and
carried a Chinese supercargo but he was the only Celestial on board
the firm only employing him on account of their having so many Chinese
traders throughout the equatorial islands of the Pacific
I had not been long on board the George Noble when I discovered that
Evers who was a fine sailorman and a good navigator as well was one
of the pigheaded kind His mate second mate and carpenter were
Britishers as were nearly all the crew but they and the skipper could
not agree There was no open rupturebut Evers had the idea that both
his officers and men disliked him because he was a Dutchman Perhaps
this was so but if it was the officers and men never showed their
dislike at being commanded by a foreignerthey knew he was a good
seaman and gave him unvarying respect and obedience Nevertheless
Captain Evers never spoke a friendly word to any one of his officers
and when he had to speak to them he did so in such a manner of strained
politeness and severity that it was really unpleasant to hear him
On our way to Sydney we called at various islands of the Gilbert Group
and finally went into Apaian Lagoon where the barquentine had to load
one hundred tons of copra dried coconut During the time I had been
on board Evers and myself had become very intimate and I am glad to
say through me he and his officers became quite friendly with each
other And we all spent many happy evenings together But I could see
that Evers was extremely jealous of his second mates reputation as a
South Sea pilot and he would very often purposely question him as to
the entrance of such and such a passage of such and such an island
and then deliberately contradict his officers plain and truthful
statements and tell him he was wrong Foster a goodhumoured old
fellow would merely laugh and change the subject though he well knew
that Captain Evers had had very little experience of the navigation
of the South Seas and relied upon his charts more than upon his local
knowledgehe would never take a suggestion from his officers both of
whom were old island menespecially the second mate
We loaded the hundred tons of copra and were ready for sea by nine
oclock one morning when a number of large sailing canoes came off
crowded with natives from a distant part of the island all anxious to
buy firearms and ammunition in view of a great expedition against the
adjacent island of Tarawa They all possessed either plenty of money
or copra and Evers did a remarkably good though illegal business and
sold them over a hundred rifles By the time they had finished however
it was past one oclock and I concluded that we could not leave the
lagoon till the following morning To my surprise and the second mates
openmouthed astonishment the skipper who was highly elated with his
mornings trading told the mate to clear the decks and get ready to
heave up
Why hes mad said the second officer to me
Now I must explain Apaian Lagoon is a vast atoll completely enclosed on
the eastern and southern sides by a low narrow strip of land densely
covered with cocopalms and on the northern and western by a continuous
chain of tiny islets connected by the reef On the western side there
are two narrow ship passages both exceedingly dangerous on account
of their being studded with numerous coral mushroomsie enormous
boulders of coral rock which resembling a mushroom in shape come to
within a few feet of the surface of the water Through these passages
the tide especially the ebb rushes with great velocitysix or seven
knots at leastand vessels when leaving the lagoon generally waited
till slack water or the first of the flood when with the usual strong
southeast trades they could stem the current and avoid the dangerous
mushrooms But no shipmaster would ever attempt either of these
passages except in the morning when the sun was astern and he could
from aloft con the ship After two or three oclock the sun would be
directly in his face and render it almost impossible for him to get
through without striking
Here then was the position when Evers cheerfully smoking a cigar and
smiling all over his handsome face gave the order to heave up It was
blowing very strongly the tide was on the ebb the sun was directly
in our faces and we were to tear through a narrow passage at racehorse
speed without being able to see anything
I ventured to suggest to him that it was a bit late for us to get under
way
Not a bit of it Come along with me up on the foreyard and youll see
how the George Noble will skip through
We certainly did skip for before the anchor was secured we were
dashing westwards for the passage at eight or nine knots and Evers kept
calling out to the mate to make more sail By the time we were abreast
of the passage the George Noble had every stitch of her canvas on
her and was fairly humming along at nearly thirteen knots over the
smooth water and then when she spun into the narrow passage through
which a sevenknot current was tearing her speed became terrific and I
held my breath The second mate and boatswain were at the wheel and
the crew were standing by the braces The silence on board was almost
painful for the terrible roar of the current as it tore along the coral
walls of the passage deadened every sound
Starboard a little shouted Evers to a sailor stationed in the fore
rigging below us who repeated the order to a man on the rail who in
turn passed the word aft
Steady there steady
I tried in vain to discern anything ahead of usthe blinding blazing
sun prevented my seeing aught but a mad seething swirl of water just
beneath our bows and on each side of us Evers however seemed very
confident
Well be through in another two minutes he began and then came a
terrific shock and both he and I were jerked off the footrope and
toppled over the yard on to the bellying foresail
We both rolled down on top of the windlass and landed almost in each
others arms half dazed I sat down on deck to consider who I was and
what was the matter and Evers made a wobbly run aft the ship still
ripping along for we had been checked in our mad career for a second or
two only
In two or three minutes we were outside and clear of danger and Evers
now much subdued brought to under the lee of the reef and anchored
Then we lowered a boat and made an examination of the ship forard
Nothing was wrong with her above her waterline but three feet further
down her stem was smashed into a pulp and bits of timber kept coming
to the surface every now and then An hour later we had nine inches of
water in the hold and the consequence of Everss pigheadedness was
that we had to keep the pumps going day and night every two hours till
we rigged a windmill which was kept going till we reached Sydney
Six months later the local trader of Apaian wrote to me and told me
that Evers has improved the passage into the lagoon very much You ran
smack into a big mushroom standing up right in the middle and broke it
off short about fifteen feet below the surface Hope the George Noble
will do the same thing next time
