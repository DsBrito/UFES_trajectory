spoke of her husbands labours or went into trade and kept a shop
as was more generally asserted by those of the Mackenzie circle who
were wont to speak their minds freely The actual and unvarnished
truth in the matter shall now be made known He with his partner
made and sold oilcloth and was possessed of premises in the New
Road over which the names of Rubb and Mackenzie were posted in
large letters As you my reader might enter therein and purchase
a yard and a half of oilcloth if you were so minded I think that
the freespoken friends of the family were not far wrong Mrs Thomas
Mackenzie however declared that she was calumniated and her
husband cruelly injured and she based her assertions on the fact
that Rubb and Mackenzie had wholesale dealings and that they sold
their article to the trade who resold it Whether or no she was
illtreated in the matter I will leave my readers to decide having
told them all that it is necessary for them to know in order that a
judgement may be formed
Walter Mackenzie the second son had been placed in his fathers
office and he also had died before the time at which our story is
supposed to commence He had been a poor sickly creature always
ailing gifted with an affectionate nature and a great respect for
the blood of the Mackenzies but not gifted with much else that was
intrinsically his own The blood of the Mackenzies was according to
his way of thinking very pure blood indeed and he had felt strongly
that his brother had disgraced the family by connecting himself with
that man Rubb in the New Road He had felt this the more strongly
seeing that Rubb and Mackenzie had not done great things in their
trade They had kept their joint commercial head above water but
had sometimes barely succeeded in doing that They had never been
bankrupt and that perhaps for some years was all that could be
said If a Mackenzie did go into trade he should at any rate have
done better than this He certainly should have done better than
this seeing that he started in life with a considerable sum of
money
Old Mackenziehe who had come from Scotlandhad been the
firstcousin of Sir Walter Mackenzie baronet of Incharrow and
he had married the sister of Sir John Ball baronet of the Cedars
Twickenham The young Mackenzies therefore had reason to be proud
of their blood It is true that Sir John Ball was the first baronet
and that he had simply been a political Lord Mayor in strong
political daysa political Lord Mayor in the leather business but
then his business had been undoubtedly wholesale and a man who gets
himself to be made a baronet cleanses himself from the stains of
trade even though he have traded in leather And then the present
Mackenzie baronet was the ninth of the name so that on the higher
and nobler side of the family our Mackenzies may be said to have
been very strong indeed This strength the two clerks in Somerset
House felt and enjoyed very keenly and it may therefore be
understood that the oilcloth manufactory was much out of favour with
them
When Tom Mackenzie was twentyfiveRubb and Mackenzie as he
afterwards becameand Walter at the age of twentyone had been
for a year or two placed at a desk in Somerset House there died one
Jonathan Ball a brother of the baronet Ball leaving all he had in
the world to the two brother Mackenzies This all was by no means a
trifle for each brother received about twelve thousand pounds when
the opposing lawsuits instituted by the Ball family were finished
These opposing lawsuits were carried on with great vigour but with
no success on the Ball side for three years By that time Sir John
Ball of the Cedars was half ruined and the Mackenzies got their
money It is needless to say much to the reader of the manner in
which Tom Mackenzie found his way into tradehow in the first
place he endeavoured to resume his Uncle Jonathans share in the
leather business instigated thereto by a desire to oppose his Uncle
JohnSir John who was opposing him in the matter of the willhow
he lost money in this attempt and ultimately embarked after
some other fruitless speculations the residue of his fortune in
partnership with Mr Rubb All that happened long ago He was now a
man of nearly fifty living with his wife and familya family of
six or seven childrenin a house in Gower Street and things had
not gone with him very well
Nor is it necessary to say very much of Walter Mackenzie who had
been four years younger than his brother He had stuck to the office
in spite of his wealth and as he had never married he had been
a rich man During his fathers lifetime and when he was quite
young he had for a while shone in the world of fashion having been
patronised by the Mackenzie baronet and by others who thought that a
clerk from Somerset House with twelve thousand pounds must be a very
estimable fellow He had not however shone in a very brilliant way
He had gone to parties for a year or two and during those years had
essayed the life of a young man about town frequenting theatres and
billiardrooms and doing a few things which he should have left
undone and leaving undone a few things which should not have been
so left But as I have said he was weak in body as well as weak
in mind Early in life he became an invalid and though he kept his
place in Somerset House till he died the period of his shining in
the fashionable world came to a speedy end
Now at length we will come to Margaret Mackenzie the sister our
heroine who was eight years younger than her brother Walter and
twelve years younger than Mr Rubbs partner She had been little more
than a child when her father died or I might more correctly say
that though she had then reached an age which makes some girls young
women it had not as yet had that effect upon her She was then
nineteen but her life in her fathers house had been dull and
monotonous she had gone very little into company and knew very
little of the ways of the world The Mackenzie baronet people had not
noticed her They had failed to make much of Walter with his twelve
thousand pounds and did not trouble themselves with Margaret who
had no fortune of her own The Ball baronet people were at extreme
variance with all her family and as a matter of course she
received no countenance from them In those early days she did not
receive much countenance from any one and perhaps I may say that she
had not shown much claim for such countenance as is often given to
young ladies by their richer relatives She was neither beautiful
nor clever nor was she in any special manner made charming by any
of those softnesses and graces of youth which to some girls seem to
atone for a want of beauty and cleverness At the age of nineteen
I may almost say that Margaret Mackenzie was ungainly Her brown
hair was rough and did not form itself into equal lengths Her
cheekbones were somewhat high after the manner of the Mackenzies
She was thin and straggling in her figure with bones larger than
they should have been for purposes of youthful grace There was
not wanting a certain brightness to her grey eyes but it was a
brightness as to the use of which she had no early knowledge At
this time her father lived at Camberwell and I doubt whether the
education which Margaret received at Miss Greens establishment for
young ladies in that suburb was of a kind to make up by art for that
which nature had not given her This school too she left at an
early ageat a very early age as her age went When she was nearly
sixteen her father who was then almost an old man became ill and
the next three years she spent in nursing him When he died she was
transferred to her younger brothers houseto a house which he had
taken in one of the quiet streets leading down from the Strand to
the river in order that he might be near his office And here for
fifteen years she had lived eating his bread and nursing him till
he also died and so she was alone in the world
During those fifteen years her life had been very weary A moated
grange in the country is bad enough for the life of any Mariana but
a moated grange in town is much worse Her life in London had been
altogether of the moated grange kind and long before her brothers
death it had been very wearisome to her I will not say that she
was always waiting for some one that came not or that she declared
herself to be aweary or that she wished that she were dead But the
mode of her life was as near that as prose may be near to poetry or
truth to romance For the coming of one who as things fell out in
that matter soon ceased to come at all to her she had for a while
been anxious There was a young clerk then in Somerset House one
Harry Handcock by name who had visited her brother in the early days
of that long sickness And Harry Handcock had seen beauty in those
grey eyes and the straggling uneven locks had by that time settled
themselves into some form of tidiness and the big joints having
been covered had taken upon themselves softer womanly motions
and the sisters tenderness to the brother had been appreciated
Harry Handcock had spoken a word or two Margaret being then
fiveandtwenty and Harry ten years her senior Harry had spoken
and Margaret had listened only too willingly But the sick brother
upstairs had become cross and peevish Such a thing should never
take place with his consent and Harry Handcock had ceased to speak
tenderly
He had ceased to speak tenderly though he didnt cease to visit the
quiet house in Arundel Street As far as Margaret was concerned he
might as well have ceased to come and in her heart she sang that
song of Marianas complaining bitterly of her weariness though the
man was seen then in her brothers sickroom regularly once a week
For years this went on The brother would crawl out to his office in
summer but would never leave his bedroom in the winter months In
those days these things were allowed in public offices and it was
not till very near the end of his life that certain stern official
reformers hinted at the necessity of his retiring on a pension
Perhaps it was that hint that killed him At any rate he died
in harnessif it can in truth be said of him that he ever wore
harness Then when he was dead the days were gone in which Margaret
Mackenzie cared for Harry Handcock Harry Handcock was still
a bachelor and when the nature of his late friends will was
ascertained he said a word or two to show that he thought he was not
yet too old for matrimony But Margarets weariness could not now be
cured in that way She would have taken him while she had nothing or
would have taken him in those early days had fortune filled her lap
with gold But she had seen Harry Handcock at least weekly for the
last ten years and having seen him without any speech of love she
was not now prepared for the renewal of such speaking
When Walter Mackenzie died there was a doubt through all the
Mackenzie circle as to what was the destiny of his money It was well
known that he had been a prudent man and that he was possessed of a
freehold estate which gave him at least six hundred a year It was
known also that he had money saved beyond this It was known too
that Margaret had nothing or next to nothing of her own The old
Mackenzie had had no fortune left to him and had felt it to be a
grievance that his sons had not joined their richer lots to his
poorer lot This of course had been no fault of Margarets but it
had made him feel justified in leaving his daughter as a burden upon
his younger son For the last fifteen years she had eaten bread to
which she had no positive claim but if ever woman earned the morsel
which she required Margaret Mackenzie had earned her morsel during
her untiring attendance upon her brother Now she was left to her
own resources and as she went silently about the house during those
sad hours which intervened between the death of her brother and
his burial she was altogether in ignorance whether any means of
subsistence had been left to her It was known that Walter Mackenzie
had more than once altered his willthat he had indeed made many
willsaccording as he was at such moments on terms of more or less
friendship with his brother but he had never told to any one what
was the nature of any bequest that he had made Thomas Mackenzie had
thought of both his brother and sister as poor creatures and had
been thought of by them as being but a poor creature himself He had
become a shopkeeper so they declared and it must be admitted that
Margaret had shared the feeling which regarded her brother Toms
trade as being disgraceful They of Arundel Street had been idle
reckless useless beingsso Tom had often declared to his wifeand
only by fits and starts had there existed any friendship between
him and either of them But the firm of Rubb and Mackenzie was not
growing richer in those days and both Thomas and his wife had felt
themselves forced into a certain amount of conciliatory demeanour by
the claims of their seven surviving children Walter however said
no word to any one of his money and when he was followed to his
grave by his brother and nephews and by Harry Handcock no one knew
of what nature would be the provision made for his sister
He was a great sufferer Harry Handcock had said at the only
interview which took place between him and Margaret after the death
of her brother and before the reading of the will
Yes indeed poor fellow said Margaret sitting in the darkened
diningroom in all the gloom of her new mourning
And you yourself Margaret have had but a sorry time of it He
still called her Margaret from old acquaintance and had always done
so
I have had the blessing of good health she said and have been
very thankful It has been a dull life though for the last ten
years
Women generally lead dull lives I think Then he had paused for
a while as though something were on his mind which he wished to
consider before he spoke again Mr Handcock at this time was bald
and very stout He was a strong healthy man but had about him to
the outward eye none of the aptitudes of a lover He was fond of
eating and drinking as no one knew better than Margaret Mackenzie
and had altogether dropped the poetries of life if at any time any
of such poetries had belonged to him He was in fact ten years
older than Margaret Mackenzie but he now looked to be almost twenty
years her senior She was a woman who at thirtyfive had more of the
graces of womanhood than had belonged to her at twenty He was a man
who at fortyfive had lost all that youth does for a man But still I
think that she would have fallen back upon her former love and found
that to be sufficient had he asked her to do so even now She would
have felt herself bound by her faith to do so had he said that such
was his wish before the reading of her brothers will But he did no
such thing I hope he will have made you comfortable he said
I hope he will have left me above want Margaret had repliedand
that had then been all She had perhaps halfexpected something
more from him remembering that the obstacle which had separated them
was now removed But nothing more came and it would hardly be true
to say that she was disappointed She had no strong desire to marry
Harry Handcock whom no one now called Harry any longer but yet for
the sake of human nature she bestowed a sigh upon his coldness when
he carried his tenderness no further than a wish that she might be
comfortable
There had of necessity been much of secrecy in the life of Margaret
Mackenzie She had possessed no friend to whom she could express her
thoughts and feelings with confidence I doubt whether any living
being knew that there now existed up in that small back bedroom in
Arundel Street quires of manuscript in which Margaret had written
her thoughts and feelingshundreds of rhymes which had never met
any eye but her own and outspoken words of love contained in letters
which had never been sent or been intended to be sent to any
destination Indeed these letters had been commenced with no name
and finished with no signature It would be hardly true to say that
they had been intended for Harry Handcock even at the warmest period
of her love They had rather been trials of her strengthproofs
of what she might do if fortune should ever be so kind to her as to
allow of her loving No one had ever guessed all this or had dreamed
of accusing Margaret of romance No one capable of testing her
character had known her In latter days she had now and again dined
in Gower Street but her sisterinlaw Mrs Tom had declared her
to be a silent stupid old maid As a silent stupid old maid the
Mackenzies of Rubb and Mackenzie were disposed to regard her But how
should they treat this stupid old maid of an aunt if it should now
turn out that all the wealth of the family belonged to her
When Walters will was read such was found to be the case There
was no doubt or room for doubt in the matter The will was dated
but two months before his death and left everything to Margaret
expressing a conviction on the part of the testator that it was his
duty to do so because of his sisters unremitting attention to
himself Harry Handcock was requested to act as executor and was
requested also to accept a gold watch and a present of two hundred
pounds Not a word was there in the whole will of his brothers
family and Tom when he went home with a sad heart told his wife
that all this had come of certain words which she had spoken when
last she had visited the sick man I knew it would be so said Tom
to his wife It cant be helped now of course I knew you could not
keep your temper quiet and always told you not to go near him How
the wife answered the course of our story at the present moment does
not require me to tell That she did answer with sufficient spirit
no one I should say need doubt and it may be surmised that things
in Gower Street were not comfortable that evening
Tom Mackenzie had communicated the contents of the will to his
sister who had declined to be in the room when it was opened He
has left you everythingjust everything Tom had said If Margaret
made any word of reply Tom did not hear it There will be over
eight hundred a year and he has left you all the furniture Tom
continued He has been very good said Margaret hardly knowing how
to express herself on such an occasion Very good to you said Tom
with some little sarcasm in his voice I mean good to me said
Margaret Then he told her that Harry Handcock had been named as
executor There is no more about him in the will is there said
Margaret At the moment not knowing much about executors she had
fancied that her brother had in making such appointment expressed
some further wish about Mr Handcock Her brother explained to her
that the executor was to have two hundred pounds and a gold watch
and then she was satisfied
Of course its a very sad lookout for us Tom said but I do not
on that account blame you
If you did you would wrong me Margaret answered for I never once
during all the years that we lived together spoke to Walter one word
about his money
I do not blame you the brother rejoined and then no more had been
said between them
He had asked her even before the funeral to go up to Gower Street and
stay with them but she had declined Mrs Tom Mackenzie had not asked
her Mrs Tom Mackenzie had hoped thenhad hoped and had inwardly
resolvedthat half at least of the dying brothers money would
have come to her husband and she had thought that if she once
encumbered herself with the old maid the old maid might remain
longer than was desirable We should never get rid of her she had
said to her eldest daughter Mary Jane Never mamma Mary Jane had
replied The mother and daughter had thought that they would be on
the whole safer in not pressing any such invitation They had not
pressed it and the old maid had remained in Arundel Street
Before Tom left the house after the reading of the will he again
invited his sister to his own home An hour or two had intervened
since he had told her of her position in the world and he was
astonished at finding how composed and selfassured she was in the
tone and manner of her answer No Tom I think I had better not
she said Sarah will be somewhat disappointed
You need not mind that said Tom
I think I had better not I shall be very glad to see her if she
will come to me and I hope you will come Tom but I think I will
remain here till I have made up my mind what to do She remained in
Arundel Street for the next three months and her brother saw her
frequently but Mrs Tom Mackenzie never went to her and she never
went to Mrs Tom Mackenzie Let it be even so said Mrs Tom they
shall not say that I ran after her and her money I hate such airs
So do I mamma said Mary Jane tossing her head I always said
that she was a nasty old maid
On that same daythe day on which the will was readMr Handcock
had also come to her I need not tell you he had said as he
pressed her hand how rejoiced I amfor your sake Margaret
Then she had returned the pressure and had thanked him for his
friendship You know that I have been made executor to the will he
continued He did this simply to save you from trouble I need only
promise that I will do anything and everything that you can wish
Then he left her saying nothing of his suit on that occasion
Two months after thisand during those two months he had
necessarily seen her frequentlyMr Handcock wrote to her from his
office in Somerset House renewing his old proposals of marriage His
letter was short and sensible pleading his cause as well perhaps
as any words were capable of pleading it at this time but it was not
successful As to her money he told her that no doubt he regarded it
now as a great addition to their chance of happiness should they
put their lots together and as to his love for her he referred her
to the days in which he had desired to make her his wife without a
shilling of fortune He had never changed he said and if her heart
was as constant as his he would make good now the proposal which she
had once been willing to accept His income was not equal to hers
but it was not inconsiderable and therefore as regards means they
would be very comfortable Such were his arguments and Margaret
little as she knew of the world was able to perceive that he
expected that they would succeed with her
Little however as she might know of the world she was not prepared
to sacrifice herself and her new freedom and her new power and her
new wealth to Mr Harry Handcock One word said to her when first
she was free and before she was rich would have carried her But an
argumentative wellworded letter written to her two months after
the fact of her freedom and the fact of her wealth had sunk into
his mind was powerless on her She had looked at her glass and
had perceived that years had improved her whereas years had not
improved Harry Handcock She had gone back over her old aspirations
aspirations of which no whisper had ever been uttered but which had
not the less been strong within her and had told herself that she
could not gratify them by a union with Mr Handcock She thought or
rather hoped that society might still open to her its portalsnot
simply the society of the Handcocks from Somerset House but that
society of which she had read in novels during the day and of which
she had dreamed at night Might it not yet be given to her to know
clever people nice people bright people people who were not heavy
and fat like Mr Handcock or sick and wearisome like her poor brother
Walter or vulgar and quarrelsome like her relatives in Gower Street
She reminded herself that she was the niece of one baronet and the
firstcousin once removed of another that she had eight hundred
a year and liberty to do with it whatsoever she pleased and she
reminded herself also that she had higher tastes in the world than
Mr Handcock Therefore she wrote to him an answer much longer than
his letter in which she explained to him that the more than ten
years interval which had elapsed since words of love had passed
between them hadhadhadchanged the nature of her regard After
much hesitation that was the phrase which she used
And she was right in her decision Whether or no she was doomed to be
disappointed in her aspirations or to be partially disappointed and
partially gratified these pages are written to tell But I think
we may conclude that she would hardly have made herself happy by
marrying Mr Handcock while such aspirations were strong upon her
There was nothing on her side in favour of such a marriage but a
faint remembrance of auld lang syne
She remained three months in Arundel Street and before that period
was over she made a proposition to her brother Tom showing to what
extent she was willing to burden herself on behalf of his family
Would he allow her she asked to undertake the education and charge
of his second daughter Susanna She would not offer to adopt her
niece she said because it was on the cards that she herself might
marry but she would promise to take upon herself the full expense
of the girls education and all charge of her till such education
should be completed If then any future guardianship on her part
should have become incompatible with her own circumstances she
should give Susanna five hundred pounds There was an air of business
about this which quite startled Tom Mackenzie who as has before
been said had taught himself in old days to regard his sister as a
poor creature There was specially an air of business about her
allusion to her own future state Tom was not at all surprised that
his sister should think of marrying but he was much surprised that
she should dare to declare her thoughts Of course she will marry
the first fool that asks her said Mrs Tom The father of the large
family however pronounced the offer to be too good to be refused
If she does she will keep her word about the five hundred pounds
he said Mrs Tom though she demurred of course gave way and when
Margaret Mackenzie left London for Littlebath where lodgings had
been taken for her she took her niece Susanna with her
CHAPTER II
Miss Mackenzie Goes to Littlebath
I fear that Miss Mackenzie when she betook herself to Littlebath
had before her minds eye no sufficiently settled plan of life She
wished to live pleasantly and perhaps fashionably but she also
desired to live respectably and with a due regard to religion How
she was to set about doing this at Littlebath I am afraid she did
not quite know She told herself over and over again that wealth
entailed duties as well as privileges but she had no clear idea what
were the duties so entailed or what were the privileges How could
she have obtained any clear idea on the subject in that prison which
she had inhabited for so many years by her brothers bedside
She had indeed been induced to migrate from London to Littlebath by
an accident which should not have been allowed to actuate her She
had been ill and the doctor with that solicitude which doctors
sometimes feel for ladies who are well to do in the world had
recommended change of air Littlebath among the Tantivy hills would
be the very place for her There were waters at Littlebath which she
might drink for a month or two with great advantage to her system It
was then the end of July and everybody that was anybody was going
out of town Suppose she were to go to Littlebath in August and stay
there for a month or perhaps two months as she might feel inclined
The London doctor knew a Littlebath doctor and would be so happy to
give her a letter Then she spoke to the clergyman of the church she
had lately attended in London who also had become more energetic in
his assistance since her brothers death than he had been before
and he also could give her a letter to a gentleman of his cloth at
Littlebath She knew very little in private life of the doctor or of
the clergyman in London but not the less on that account might
their introductions be of service to her in forming a circle of
acquaintance at Littlebath In this way she first came to think of
Littlebath and from this beginning she had gradually reached her
decision
Another little accident or two other little accidents had nearly
induced her to remain in Londonnot in Arundel Street which was to
her an odious locality but in some small genteel house in or about
Brompton She had written to the two baronets to announce to them
her brothers death Tom Mackenzie the surviving brother having
positively refused to hold any communication with either of them
To both these letters after some interval she received courteous
replies Sir Walter Mackenzie was a very old man over eighty who
now never stirred away from Incharrow in Rossshire Lady Mackenzie
was not living Sir Walter did not write himself but a letter came
from Mrs Mackenzie his eldest sons wife in which she said that
she and her husband would be up in London in the course of the next
spring and hoped that they might then have the pleasure of making
their cousins acquaintance This letter it was true did not come
till the beginning of August when the Littlebath plan was nearly
formed and Margaret knew that her cousin who was in Parliament had
himself been in London almost up to the time at which it was written
so that he might have called had he chosen But she was prepared to
forgive much There had been cause for offence and if her great
relatives were now prepared to take her by the hand there could be
no reason why she should not consent to be so taken Sir John Ball
the other baronet had absolutely come to her and had seen her
There had been a regular scene of reconciliation and she had gone
down for a day and night to the Cedars Sir John also was an old man
being over seventy and Lady Ball was nearly as old Mr Ball the
future baronet had also been there He was a widower with a large
family and small means He had been and of course still was a
barrister but as a barrister he had never succeeded and was now
waiting sadly till he should inherit the very moderate fortune which
would come to him at his fathers death The Balls indeed had not
done well with their baronetcy and their cousin found them living
with a degree of strictness as to small expenses which she herself
had never been called upon to exercise Lady Ball indeed had a
carriagefor what would a baronets wife do without onebut it did
not very often go out And the Cedars was an old place with grounds
and paddocks appertaining but the ancient solitary gardener could
not make much of the grounds and the grass of the paddocks was
always sold Margaret when she was first asked to go to the Cedars
felt that it would be better for her to give up her migration to
Littlebath It would be much she thought to have her relations near
to her But she had found Sir John and Lady Ball to be very dull and
her cousin the father of the large family had spoken to her about
little except money She was not much in love with the Balls when she
returned to London and the Littlebath plan was allowed to go on
She made a preliminary journey to that place and took furnished
lodgings in the Paragon Now it is known to all the world that the
Paragon is the nucleus of all that is pleasant and fashionable at
Littlebath It is a long row of houses with two short rows abutting
from the ends of the long row and every house in it looks out upon
the Montpelier Gardens If not built of stone these houses are built
of such stucco that the Margaret Mackenzies of the world do not know
the difference Six steps which are of undoubted stone lead up to
each door The areas are grand with high railings The flagged way
before the houses is very broad and at each corner there is an
extensive sweep so that the carriages of the Paragonites may be
