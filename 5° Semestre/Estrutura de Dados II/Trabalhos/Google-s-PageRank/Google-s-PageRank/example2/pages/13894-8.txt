Carpet halflaid Trunks and bags lying about in corners some opened
Mens wearing apparel exposed Mantelpiece R in disorder At back
double doors ajar leading to another room Door L leading to

TIMEEvening in August
ALBERT SHAWN is reclining on the sofa fully dressed but obviously
ill an overcoat has been drawn over his legs A conspicuous object is a
magnificent light purple dressinggown thrown across a chair
Door bangs off Enter ILAM CARVE in his shirt sleeves hurriedly
SHAWN feebly tries to get up
CARVE Now dont move Remember youre a sick man and forget youre a
servant
SHAWN shivers CARVE about to put on his dressinggown
changes his mind and wraps it round SHAWN as well as he can
CARVE then puts on an oldish coat
SHAWN Feebly Youve been very quick sir
CARVE I found a red lamp only three doors off Hell be along in half a
minute
SHAWN Did you explain what it was sir
CARVE Genially How could I explain what it was you fool when I
dont know I simply asked to see the doctor and I told him there was a
fellowcreature suffering at No 126 and would he come at once 126
he said 126 has been shut up for years
SHAWN Trying to smile What did you say sir
CARVE I said articulating with clearness a hundred and
twentysixand ran off Then he yelled out after me that hed come
instantly I say Shawn were discovered I could tell that from his
sudden change of tone I bet the entire street knows that the celebrated
Me has arrived at last I feel like a criminal already dashed if I
dont I wish wed gone to a hotel now Walks about I say did you
make up the bed
SHAWN I was just doing it sir
CARVE But what about sheets and so on
SHAWN I bought some this morning ready hemmed sirwith those and the
travelling rug
CARVE Well dont you think you could work your passage out to the bed
With my help
SHAWN Me in your bed sir
CARVE Genially bullying Keep on in that toneand Ill give you
the sack on the spot Now then Trybefore the doctor comes Bell
rings
SHAWN The bell sirexcuse me
CARVE Confound
Exit CARVE
SHAWN coughs and puts a handkerchief to his mouth CARVE
returns immediately with DR PASCOE
PASCOE Glancing round quickly This the patient Goes to SHAWN
and looks at him Then taking a clinical thermometer from his pocket
and wiping it with marked respect Allow me to put this under your
tongue for half a minute Having done so he takes SHAWNS wrist
and looking at his watch counts the patients pulse Then turning to
CARVE in a low curt voiced When did this begin
CARVE Just now That is he only began to complain about six oclock
We arrived in London this morning from Madrid
PASCOE Reading thermometer Temperature 10412 Pulse is 140and
weak I must have some boiling water
CARVE At a loss What for
PASCOE What for For a poultice
CARVE Helplessly But there isnt any  weve nothing except this
spiritlamp Pointing to lamp on table
PASCOE No women in the house
CARVE With humour that the doctor declines to see Not one
PASCOE Controlling his exasperation Never mind Ill run round to
the surgery and get my hypodermic To SHAWN reassuringly and
deferentially I shall be back at once Mr Carve To CARVE near
door Keep your master well covered upI suppose you can do that
Exit
CARVE Shawn my poor fellow he takes you for the illustrious Ilam
Carve This is what comes of me rushing out in shirt sleeves Gesture
of despair I cant explain it to him
SHAWN But
CARVE Its all right Youll be infinitely better looked after you
know and I shall be saved from their infernal curiosity
SHAWN Its only this sir I was halfexpecting a young lady tonight
sir very feebly At least I believe shes young
CARVE Shawn Ive always suspected you were a bad lot Now I know I
also know why you were so devilish anxious to put me to bed early What
am I to say to this young lady on your behalf
SHAWN worse too ill to answer Pause Reenter DR PASCOE
very rapidly with a large tumbler halffull of hot liquid
PASCOE You may say Ive been quick As he bends down to SHAWN
addressing CARVE Get me a wine glass of clean cold water To
SHAWN Now please I want you to drink a little brandy and water
SHAWN makes no response By Jove The doctor pours some of the
brandy and water down SHAWNS throat
CARVE Who has been wandering about vaguely I dont think weve got
a wine glass Theres a cup but I suppose that isnt medical enough
PASCOE Taking a syringe from his pocket and unscrewing it Pour
some water in it CARVE obeys Now hold it
CARVE Indicating syringe What is this device PASCOE This device
Im going to get some strychnine into him by injection Steady with that
cup now
Pascoe drops a tablet into the syringe and screws it up again
draws a little water up into the syringe and shakes the syringe
Then he goes to SHAWN to make the injection on the top side of
the patients forearm CARVE still holds the cup out
mechanically
PASCOE Ive done with that cup
CARVE Putting the cup down Might I ask whats the matter with him
PASCOE Pneumonia is the matter
Noise of some one in the hall
CARVE Startled Surely thats some one in the hall
PASCOE Keep perfectly calm my man Its my assistant I left the door
open on purpose for him Hes got the poultice and things In a loud
voice as he finishes the injection Come along come along there This
way
Enter EDWARD HORNING with poultice lint bandages etc
PASCOE Found the antiphlogistine
EDWARD Yes He looks at patient and exchanges a glance with
PASCOE
PASCOE Wheres the bedroom
CARVE Theres one there Pointing to double doors
PASCOE To HORNING Well get him into bed now To CARVE Bed
ready
CARVE Yes II think he was just making it up
PASCOE Startled Does he make up his own bed
CARVE Perceiving the mistake but resuming his calm Always
PASCOE Controlling his astonishment looking through double doors and
opening them wider To HORNING Yes this will do Put those things
down here a minute while we lift him
PASCOE and HORNING then carry the inanimate form of SHAWN
into the room behind while CARVE hovers about uselessly
CARVE Can I do anything
PASCOE Indicating a chair furthest away from the double doors You
see that chair
CARVE I see it
PASCOE Go and sit on it
Exeunt PASCOE and HORNING back closing double doors
After walking about CARVE sits down on another chair A bell
rings twice He pays no attention Then enter JANET CANNOT L
CARVE jumps up but is inarticulate though very favourably
interested
JANET Smiling sympathetically I rang twice
CARVE The bell must be out of order
JANET I couldnt be sure but I dont think its the bell thats out of
order
CARVE Oh You think Im out of order
JANET No I was thinking that youd only just come into the houseall
you famous folkand you hadnt quite got it straight yetas it were
Looking vaguely at room
CARVE All we famous folk
JANET WellI dont know myself about that sort of thing
CARVE What sort of thing
JANET Picturepainting isnt it I mean real pictures done by hand
colouredCARVE Ahyes
JANET After a slight pause It struck me all of a sudden while I
was waiting at the door that it might have been left open on purpose
CARVE The front door On purpose What for
JANET Ohfor some one particular to walk in without any fuss So in I
stepped
CARVE Youre the young lady that Mr Shawns expectingGoing
towards passage
JANET Stopping him Its shut now You dont want everybody
walking in do you
CARVE Looking at JANET with pleasure So youre the young
ladyMrsMiss
JANET Ignoring his question Was it a message you had for me
CARVE No no Not a message Butthe fact is were rather upset
here for the moment
JANET Yes Illness
CARVE Now if it isnt an indiscreet question how did you know that
there was illness
JANET I was standing looking at this house and wondering whether I
shouldnt do better to go right back home there and then But No I
said Ive begun and Ill go through with itWell I was standing
there when what should I see but a parlour maid pop up from the area
steps next door and she says to me over the railings The doctors
just been Just like that excited So I said Thank you miss I
hope its nothing serious
CARVE Pneumonia
JANET Pneumonia What a mercy
CARVE Mercy
JANET If you look at it sensibly its about the best illness anybody
could have in hot weather like this Youve got to keep them warm The
weather does it for you If it was typhoid now and youd got to keep
them coolthat would be awkward Not but it passes me how anybody can
catch pneumonia in August
CARVE Coming over from the Continent
JANET Oh the Continent Its not Mr Shawn thats ill
CARVE Hesitating Mr Shawn Oh no no Its Ilam Carve
JANET Half whispering Awed Oh him Poor thing And nobody but
men in the house
CARVE And who told you that
JANET Well waves her hand to indicate the state of the room smiling
indulgently I always feel sorry for gentlemen when they have to manage
for themselves even if theyre well and hearty But when it comes to
illnessI cant bear to think about it Still everybody has their own
notions of comfort And Ive no doubt hell very soon be better
CARVE You think he will
JANET Blandly cheerful As a general rule you may say that people
do get better Thats my experience Of course sometimes they take a
longish time And now and then one dieselse what use would cemeteries
be But as a general rule theyre soon over it Now am I going to see
Mr Shawn or shall I
CARVE Well if you could call again
JANET You say you hadnt a message
CARVE Not precisely a message But if you could call again
JANET When
CARVE Rather eagerly Any time Any time Soon
JANET Night after tomorrow
CARVE Why not morning
JANET Perhaps morning is safer Thank you Very well then Day after
tomorrow I suppose Mr Shawn has a rare fine situation here
CARVE Shrugging his shoulders Nothing to complain of if you ask
me
JANET offers her hand quite simply The double doors open CARVE
looks alarmed
JANET Thank you very much I think I can open the front door myself
CARVE I sayyou wont forget
JANET Well what do you think
Exit L
Enter DR PASCOE through double doors
PASCOE At double doors to HORNING invisible behind Then theres
no reason why the nurse at Edith Grove shouldnt come along here
HORNING Off Yes Shell be free in an hour
PASCOE All right Ill look in there
HORNING Nervous What am I to do if his respiration
PASCOE Interrupting Dont worry Im not gone yet I must just
clean up my hypodermic Shut those doors
HORNING obeys
CARVE Whats this about a nurse
PASCOE Busy with syringe water and syringecase Im sending one
in Ironically Do you see any objection
CARVE On the contrary I should like him to be treated with every care
Hes invaluable to me
PASCOE Staggered Invaluable to you Of course in my line of
business I get used to meeting odd people
CARVE Recovering from his mistake But you think I carry oddness
rather far
PASCOE The idea did pass through my mind
CARVE Nervousnessnothing but nervousness Im very nervous And
thenyou know the sayinglike master like man
PASCOE Indicating back room with a gesture in a slightly more
confidential tone as CARVES personal attractiveness gains on him
Mr Carve odd
CARVE Oh very Always was Ever since Ive known him You remember his
first picture at the Academy
PASCOE No not exactly
CARVE Either you remember it exactly or you dont remember it at all
Lifesize picture of a policeman blowing his whistle
PASCOE Yes it must have been odd that must
CARVE Not a bit The oddness of the fellow
PASCOE What fellowyour governor
CARVE Nods His oddness came out in this wayalthough the thing
had really a great success from that day to this hes never painted
another lifesize picture of a policeman blowing his whistle
PASCOE I dont see anything very odd there
CARVE Dont you Well perhaps you dont go in for art much If you
did youd know that the usual and correct thing for a painter who has
made a great success with a lifesize picture of a policeman blowing his
whistle is to keep on doing lifesize pictures of a policeman blowing
his whistle for ever and ever so that the public can always count on
getting from him a lifesize picture of a policeman blowing his whistle
PASCOE I observe you are one of those comic valets Nervousness again
no doubt
CARVE Smiling and continuing Seeing the way he invariably flouted
the public its always been a mystery to me how he managed to make a
name to say nothing of money
PASCOE Money He must make pots You say I dont go in for art much
but I always read the big sales at Christies Why wasnt it that
policeman picture that Lord Leonard Alcar bought for 2000 guineas last
year
CARVE No not Alcar I think the bobby was last bought by Texel
PASCOE Texel Whos Texel
CARVE CollectorUnited Statesone of their kings Im told
PASCOE Oh him Controls all the ink in the United States
CARVE Really Thats what I should call influence No It was the
Pelicans feeding their Young that Alcar bought Four thousand Youre
getting mixed up
PASCOE Perhaps I am I know Im constantly seeing Mr Carves name in
connection with Lord Leonard Alcars Its a nice question which is the
best known of the two
CARVE Then thegovernor really is famous in England You see we never
come to England
PASCOE FamousI should think he was Arent they always saying hes
the finest colourist since Titian And look at his prices
CARVE Yes Ive looked at his prices Titians prices are higher but
Titian isnt what youd call famous with the general public is he
What I want to know isis the governor famous among the general
public
PASCOE Yes
CARVE About how famous should you say he is
PASCOE Hesitating Wellabruptly thats a silly question
CARVE No it isnt Is he as famous aserHarry Lauder
PASCOE Shakes his head You mustnt go to extremes
CARVE Is he as famous as Harry Vardon
PASCOE Never heard of him
CARVE I only see these names in the papers Is he as famous as Bernard
Shaw
PASCOE Yes I should say he was
CARVE Oh well thats not so bad Better than I thought Its so
difficult to judge where one iserpersonally concerned Especially if
youre never on the spot
PASCOE So its true Mr Carve never comes to England
CARVE Why should he come to England He isnt a portrait painter Its
true he owns this house but surely that isnt sufficient excuse for
living in a place like England
PASCOE Of course if you look at it like that theres no particular
attractiveness in England that Ive ever seen But that answer wouldnt
satisfy Redcliffe Gardens Redcliffe Gardens is persuaded that there
must be a special reason
CARVE Well there is
PASCOE Interested in spite of himself Indeed
CARVE Confidentially Have a cigarette Offering case
PASCOE Staggered anew but accepting Thats a swagger case
CARVE Oh Calmly He gave it me
PASCOE Really
CARVE Well you see were more like brothersbeen together so long He
gives me his best suits too Look at this waistcoat Motions the
hypnotised PASCOE to take a chair They light their cigarettes
Enter HORNING
PASCOE Somewhat impatient Hes not worse already
HORNING Wheres that brandy and water
PASCOE Be careful Hes had about enough of that
HORNING Seeing Ive had no dinner yetI thought it might suit me
Exit with tumbler
PASCOE To Carve with renewed eagerness So there is a special
reason why you keep out of England
CARVE Yesshyness
PASCOE Howshyness
CARVE Just simple shyness Shyness is a disease with the governor a
perfect disease
PASCOE But everyones shy The more experience I get the more convinced
I am that were all shy Why you were shy when you came to fetch me
CARVE Did you notice it
PASCOE Of course And I was shy when I came in here I was thinking to
myself Now Im going to see the great Ilam Carve actually in the
flesh and I was shy Youd think my profession would have cured me of
being shy but not a bit Nervous disease of course Ought to be
treated as such Almost universal Besides even if he is shy your
governoreven if hes a hundredfold shy thats no reason for keeping
out of England Shyness is not one of those diseases you can cure by
change of climate
CARVE Pardon me My esteemed employers shyness is a special shyness
Hes only shy when he has to play the celebrity So long as people take
him for no one in particular hes quite all right For instance hes
never shy with me But instantly people approach him as the celebrity
instantly he sees in the eye of the beholder any consciousness of being
in the presence of a toffthen he gets desperately shy and his one
desire is to be alone at sea or to be buried somewhere deep in the
bosom of the earth PASCOE laughs What are you laughing at CARVE
also laughs
PASCOE Go on go on Im enjoying it
CARVE No but seriously Its true what I tell you It amounts almost
to a tragedy in the brilliant career of my esteemed You see now that
England would be impossible for him as a residence You see dont you
PASCOE Quite
CARVE Why even on the Continent in the big towns and the big hotels
we often travel incognito for safety Its only in the country districts
that he goes about under his own name
PASCOE So that hes really got no friends
CARVE None except a few Italian and Spanish peasantsand me
PASCOE Well well Its an absolute mania then this shyness
CARVE Slightly hurt Oh not so bad as that And then its only
fair to say he has his moments of great daringyou may say rashness
PASCOE All timid people are like that
CARVE Are they Musing Were here now owing to one of his moments
of rashness
PASCOE Indeed
CARVE Yes We met an English lady in a village in Andalusia andwell
of course I cant tell you everythingbut she flirted with him and he
flirted with her
PASCOE Under his own name
CARVE Yes And then he proposed to her I knew all along it was a
blunder
PASCOE Ironic Did you
CARVE Yes She belonged to the aristocracy and she was one of those
amateur painters that wander about the Continent by themselvesyou
know
PASCOE And did she accept
CARVE Oh yes They got as far as Madrid together and then all of a
sudden my esteemed saw that he had made a mistake
PASCOE And what then
CARVE We fled the country We hooked it The idea of coming to London
struck himjust the caprice of a man whos lost his headand here we
are
PASCOE After a pause He doesnt seem to me from the look of him to
be a man whodshall we saystrictly avoided women
CARVE Startled with a gesture towards back Him
PASCOE nods
Really Confound him Now Ive always suspected that though he manages
to keep his goingson devilish quiet
PASCOE Rising It occurs to me my friend that Im listening to
too much But youre so persuasive
CARVE Its such a pleasure to talk freelyfor once in a way
PASCOE Freelyis the word
CARVE Oh He wont mind
PASCOE In a peculiar tone Its quite possible
Enter HORNING
HORNING To Carve I say its just occurred to me Mr Carve hasnt
been digging or gardening or anything I suppose and then taken cold
after
CARVE Digging Oh no He must have got a bad chill on the steamer Why
HORNING Nothing Only his hands and fingernails are so rough
CARVE After thinking Oh I see All artists are like that Messing
about with paints and acids and things Look at my hands
PASCOE But are you an artist too
CARVE Recovering himself calmly No no
PASCOE To Horning Hows he going on
HORNING Shrugs his shoulders Im sure the base of both lungs is
practically solid
PASCOE Well we cant do more than we have done my boy
HORNING Hell never pull through
PASCOE Calmly I should certainly be surprised if he did
CARVE Astounded Butbut
PASCOE But what
CARVE You dont mean to sayWhy hes a strong healthy man
PASCOE Precisely Not very unusual for your strong healthy man to die
of pneumonia in twentyfour hours You ought to know at your age that
its a highly dangerous thing to be strong and healthy Turning
away Ill have another look at him before I go
CARVE Extremely perturbed But this is ridiculous I simply dont
know what I shall do without that man
The stage is darkened for a few moments to indicate passage of
time
SCENE 2
TIMEThe next morning but one Slightly less disorder in the room
CARVE and PASCOE are together the latter ready to leave
CARVE Will there have to be an inquest
PASCOE Inquest Of course not
CARVE Its some relief to know that I couldnt have faced a coroner
PASCOE Staring at him Perfectly ordinary case
CARVE Thats what you call perfectly ordinary is it A man is quite
well on Tuesday afternoon and dead at 4 am on Thursday morning
Looking at his watch My watch has stopped
PASCOE With fierce sarcasm One of those cheap German watches I
suppose that stop when you dont wind them up Its a singular thing
that when people stay up all night they take it for granted their
watches are just as excited as they are Look here youll be collapsing
soon When did you have anything to eat last
CARVE Almost half an hour ago Two sausages that were sent in yesterday
for the nurse
PASCOE Shes gone
CARVE Oh yes
PASCOE Well take my advice Try to get some sleep now Youve had no
reply from the relativesthe auctioneer cousinwhats his Christian
nameCyrus
CARVE No II didnt telegraphI forgot
PASCOE Well upon my soul I specially reminded you yesterday
afternoon
CARVE I didnt know the address
PASCOE Ever heard of the London Directory Youd better run out and
wire instantly You dont seem to realize that the death of a man like
Ilam Carve will make something of a stir in the world And you may
depend on it that whether theyd quarrelled or not Cyrus Carve will
want to know why he wasnt informed of the illness at once Youve let
yourself in for a fine row and well you deserve it
CARVE After a few paces See here doctor Im afraid theres been
some mistake Facing him nervously
PASCOE What
CARVE II
Bell rings
PASCOE Firmly Listen to me my man Theres been no sort of
mistake Everything has been done that could be done Dont you get
ideas into your head Lie down and rest Youre done up and if you
arent careful youll be ill Ill communicate with Cyrus Carve I can
telephone and while Im about it Ill ring up the registrar toohell
probably send a clerk round
CARVE Registrar
PASCOE Registrar of deaths Therell be all kinds of things to attend
to Moving to go out
Bell rings again
CARVE As if dazed Is that the front door bell
PASCOE Drily Quite possibly Ill open it
Exit
CARVE alone makes a gesture of despair Reenter PASCOE with
CYRUS CARVE
PASCOE As they enter Yes very sudden very sudden There were
three of usa nurse my assistant and myself This is Mr Shawn the
deceaseds valet
CYRUS Morning Looks round at disorder of room contemptuously
Pigstye My name is Cyrus Carve Im your late masters cousin and
his only relative Youve possibly never heard of me
CARVE Curtly Oh yes I have You got up a great quarrel when you
were aged twelve you and he
CYRUS Your manner isnt very respectful my friend However you may
have treated my cousin be good enough to remember youre not my
valet
CARVE How did you get to know about it
CYRUS I suppose he forbade you to send for me eh Pause Eh
CARVE Jumping at this suggestion Yes
PASCOE So that was it
CYRUS Ignoring PASCOE Ha Well since youre so curious I saw it
a quarter of an hour ago in a special edition of a halfpenny rag I was
on my way to the office Showing paper Here you are The Evening
Courier Quite a full account of the illness You couldnt send for me
but you could chatter to some journalist
CARVE Ive never spoken to a journalist in my life
CYRUS Then how
PASCOE Its probably my assistant His brother is something rather
important on the Courier and he may have telephoned to him Its a
big item of news you know Mr Carve
CYRUS Drily I imagine so Where is the body
PASCOE Upstairs Moving towards door
