should be very much obliged to Asaph perhaps I shouldnt He has gotten
me out of a difficultyor into one I am far from certain which
OrdinarilyI am speaking now of the writing of swashbuckling
romances which is or was my tradeI swear I never have called it
a professionthe beginning of a story is the least of the troubles
connected with its manufacture Given a character or two and a
situation the beginning of one of those romances is or was pretty
likely to be something like this
It was a black night Heavy clouds had obscured the setting sun and
now as the clock in the great stone tower boomed twelve the darkness
was pitchy
That is a good safe beginning Midnight a stone tower a booming clock
and darkness make an appeal to the imagination On a night like that
almost anything may happen A reader of one of my romancesand
readers there must be for the things did and still do sell to some
extentmight be fairly certain that something WOULD happen before the
end of the second page After that the somethings continued to happen as
fast as I could invent them
But this story was different The weather or the time had nothing to do
with its beginning There were no solitary horsemen or strange wayfarers
on lonely roads no unexpected knocks at the doors of taverns no
cloaked personages landing from boats rowed by blackbrowed seamen with
red handkerchiefs knotted about their heads and knives in their
belts The hero was not addressed as My Lord he was not Sir
Somebodyorother in disguise He was not young and handsome there was
not even a certain something in his manner and bearing which hinted of
an eventful past Indeed there was not For if this particular yarn or
history or chronicle which I had made up my mind to write and which I
am writing now had or has a hero I am he And I am Hosea Kent Knowles
of Bayport Massachusetts the latter the village in which I was born
and in which I have lived most of the time since I was twentyseven
years old Nobody calls me My Lord Hephzy has always called me
Hosya name which I despiseand the others most of them Kent to
my face and The Quahaug behind my back a quahaug being a very common
form of clam which is supposed to lead a solitary existence and to
keep its shell tightly shut If anything in my manner had hinted at a
mysterious past no one in Bayport would have taken the hint Bayporters
know my past and that of my ancestors only too well
As for being young and handsomewell I was thirtyeight years old last
March Which is quite enough on THAT subject
But I had determined to write the story so I sat down to begin it And
immediately I got into difficulties How should I begin I might begin
at any one of a dozen placeswith Hephzys receiving the Raymond and
Whitcomb circular with our arrival in London with Jim Campbells visit
to me here in Bayport with the curious way in which the letter reached
us after crossing the ocean twice Any one of these might serve as a
beginningbut which I made I dont know how many attempts but not
one was satisfactory I who had begun I am ashamed to tell you how many
storiesyes and had finished them and seen them in print as wellwas
stumped at the very beginning of this one Like Sim Phinney I had
worked at my job a long spell and callated I knew it but here
was something I didnt know As Sim said when he faced his problem I
couldnt seem to get steerage way on her
Simeon you seeHe is Angeline Phinneys second cousin and lives in
the third house beyond the Holiness Bethel on the righthand side of the
roadSimeon has done carpentering here in Bayport all his life He
built practically every henhouse now gracing or disgracing the backyards
of our village He is our henhouse specialist so to speak He has
even been known to boast of his skill Henhouses snorted Sim land
of love I can build a henhouse with my eyes shut Nowadays when another
one of them foolheads thats been readin How to Make a Million Poultry
Raisin in the Farm Gazette comes to me and says Henhouse I say
Yes sir Fifteen dollars if you pay me cash now and a hundred and
fifteen if you want to wait and pay me out of your egg profits Thats
all there is to it
And yet when Captain Darius Nickerson who made the most of his money
selling fiftyfoot lots of sand beachgrass and ticks to summer
people for bungalow siteswhen Captain Darius grown purseproud and
vainglorious expressed a desire for a henhouse with a mansard roof and
a cupola the latter embellishments to match those surmounting his own
dwelling Simeon was set aback with his canvas flapping At the end of
a week he had not driven a nail Godfreys mighty he is reported to
have exclaimed I dont know whether to build the average cupola and
trust to a hens fittin it or take an average hen and build a cupola
round her Maybe Ill be all right after I get started but its where
to start that beats me
Where to start beat me also and it might be beating me yet if I
hadnt dropped in at the postoffice and heard Asaph Tidditt telling
a story to the group around the stove After he had finished and
the mail being sorted we were walking homeward together I asked a
question
Asaph said I when you start to spin a yarn how do you begin
Hey he exclaimed How do I begin Why I just heave to and go to
work and begin thats all
Yes I know but where do you begin
At the beginnin naturally If you was callatin to sail a boat race
you wouldnt commence at tother end of the course would you
I might practical people wouldnt I suppose Butwhat IS the
beginning Suppose there were a lot of beginnings and you didnt know
which to choose
Oh well in that case Id just sort ofof edge around till I found
one thatthat was a beginnin of SOMETHIN and Id start there You
understand dont you Take that yarn I was spinnin just nowthat one
about Josiah Dimicks great uncles pig on his mothers side I mean
his uncle on his mothers side not the pig of course Now I hadnt no
intention of tellin about that hog hadnt thought of it for a thousand
year as you might say I just commenced to tell about Angie Phinney
about how fast she could talk and that reminded me of a parrot
that belonged to Sylvanus Cahoons sisterViolet the sisters name
wasloony name too if you ask ME cause she was a plaguey sight
nigher bein a sunflower than she was a violetweighed two hundred and
ten and had a face on her as red as
Just a minute Ase About that pig
Oh yes Well the pig reminded me of Violets parrot and the parrot
reminded me of a Plymouth Rock rooster I had that used to roost in the
pigpen nightswouldnt use the henhouse no moren you nor I wouldand
that naturally made me think of pigs and pigs fetched Josiahs
uncles pig to mind and there I was all ready to start on the yarn It
pretty often works out that way When you want to start a yarn and you
cant startyouve forgot it or somethinjust begin somewhere get
goin somehow Edge around and keep edgin around and pretty soon youll
fetch up at the right place TO start See dont you Kent
I sawthat is I saw enough I came home and this morning I began the
edging around process I dont seem to have fetched up anywhere in
particular but I shall keep on with the edging until I do As Asaph
says I must begin somewhere so I shall begin with the Saturday morning
of last April when Jim Campbell my publisher and my friendwhich is
by no means such an unusual combination as many people thinksat on the
veranda of my boathouse overlooking Cape Cod Bay and discussed my past
present and more particularly my future
CHAPTER II
Which Repeats for the Most Part What Jim Campbell Said to Me and What
I Said to Him
Jim said I what is the matter with me
Jim who was seated in the ancient and dilapidated armchair which
was the finest piece of furniture in the boathouse and which I always
offered to visitors looked at me over the collar of my sweater I used
the sweater as I did the armchair when I did not have visitors He was
using it then because like an idiot he had come to Cape Cod in April
with nothing warmer than a very natty suit and a light overcoat Of
course one may go clamming and fishing in a light overcoat butone
doesnt
Jim looked at me over the collar of my sweater Then he crossed
his oilskinned and rubberbooted legsthey were my oilskins and my
bootsand answered promptly
Indigestion he said You ate nine of those biscuits this morning I
saw you
I did not I retorted because you saw them first MY interior is in
its normal condition As for yours
Mine he interrupted filling his pipe from my tobacco pouch being
accustomed to a breakfast not a gorge is abnormal but satisfactory
thank youquite satisfactory
That said I we will discuss later when I have you out back of the
bar in my catboat Judging from present indications there will be some
searunning The Hephzy is a good capable craft but a bit cranky
like the lady she is named for I imagine she will roll
He didnt like that You see I had sailed with him before and I
remembered
Hosea he drawled you have a vivid imagination It is a pity you
dont use more of it in those stories of yours
Humph I am obliged to use the most of it on the royalty statements you
send me If you call me Hosea again I will take the Hephzy across
the Point Rip The waves there are fifteen feet high at low tide See
here I asked you a serious question and I should like a serious answer
Jim what IS the matter with me Have I written out or what is the
trouble
He looked at me again
Are you in earnest he asked
I am very much in earnest
And you really want to talk shop after a breakfast like that and on a
morning like this
I do
Was that why you asked me to come to Bayport and spend the weekend
Noo No of course not
Youre another it was When you met me at the railroad station
yesterday I could see there was something wrong with you All this
morning youve had something on your chest I thought it was the
biscuits of course but it wasnt eh
It was not
Then what was it Arent we paying you a large enough royalty
You are paying me a good deal larger one than I deserve I dont see
why you do it
Oh with a wave of the hand thats all right The publishing of
books is a pure philanthropy We are in business for our health and
Shut up You know as well as I do that the last two yarns of mine which
your house published have not done as well as the others
I had caught him now Anything remotely approaching a reflection upon
the business house of which he was the head was sufficient to stir
up Jim Campbell That business its methods and its success were his
idols
I dont know any such thing he protested hotly We sold
Hang the sale You sold quite enough It is an everlasting miracle
to me that you are able to sell a single copy Why a selfrespecting
person possessed of any intelligence whatever should wish to read the
stuff I write to say nothing of paying money for the privilege I cant
understand
You dont have to understand No one expects an author to understand
anything All you are expected to do is to write well attend to the
rest of it And as for saleswhy The Black Brigthat was the last
one wasnt itbeat the Omelet by eight thousand or more
The Omelet was our pet name for The Queens Amulet my first offence
in the literary line It was a highly seasoned concoction of revolution
and adventure in a mythical kingdom where life was not dull to say the
least The humblest character in it was a viscount Living in Bayport
had naturally made me familiar with the doings of viscounts
Eight thousand more than the last isnt so bad is it demanded Jim
Campbell combatively
It isnt It is astonishingly good It is the books themselves that
are bad The Omelet was bad enough but I wrote it more as a joke than
anything else I didnt take it seriously at all Every time I called
a duke by his Christian name I grinned But nowadays I dont grinI
swear I hate the things Jim Theyre no good And the reviewers are
beginning to tumble to the fact that theyre no good too You saw the
press notices yourself Another Thriller by the Indefatigable Knowles
Barnacles Buccaneers and Blood not to Mention Beauty and the
Bourbons Thats the way two writers headed their articles about The
Black Brig And a third said that I must be getting tired I wrote as
if I was THAT fellow was right I am tired Jim Im tired and sick
of writing slush I cant write any more of it And yet I cant write
anything else
Jims pipe had gone out Now he relit it and tossed the match over the
veranda rail
How do you know you cant he demanded
Cant what
Cant write anything but slush
Ah ha Then it is slush You admit it
I dont admit anything of the kind You may not be a William
Shakespeare or even a George Meredith but you have written some mighty
interesting stories Why I know a chap who sits up till morning to
finish a book of yours Cant sleep until he has finished it
Whats the matter with him insomnia
No hes a night watchman Does that satisfy you you crossgrained
old shellfish Come on lets dig clamssome of your own blood
relationsand forget it
I dont want to forget it and there is plenty of time for clamming The
tide wont cover the flats for two hours yet I tell you Im serious
Jim I cant write any more I know it The stuff Ive been writing
makes me sick I hate it I tell you What the devil Im going to do for
a living I cant seebut I cant write another story
Jim put his pipe in his pocket I think at last he was convinced that I
meant what I said which I certainly did The last year had been a year
of torment to me I had finished the Brig as a matter of duty but if
that piratical craft had sunk with all hands including its creator I
should not have cared I drove myself to my desk each day as a horse
might be driven to a treadmill but the animal could have taken no less
interest in his work than I had taken in mine It was badbadbad
worthless and hateful There wasnt a new idea in it and I hadnt one
in my head I who had taken up writing as a last resort a gamble which
might on a hundredtoone chance win where everything else had failed
had now reached the point where that had failed too Campbells surmise
was correct with the pretence of asking him to the Cape for a
weekend of fishing and sailing I had lured him there to tell him of my
discouragement and my determination to quit
He took his feet from the rail and hitched his chair about until he
faced me
So youre not going to write any more he said
Im not I cant
What are you going to do live on back royalties and clams
I may have to live on the clams my back royalties wont keep me very
long
Humph I should think they might keep you a good while down here You
must have something in the stocking You cant have wasted very much in
riotous living on this sandheap What have you done with your money
for the last ten years been leading a double life
Ive found leading a single one hard enough I have saved something of
course It isnt the money that worries me Jim I told you that Its
myself Im no good Every author sometime or other reaches the point
where he knows perfectly well he has done all the real work he can
ever do that he has written himself out Thats whats the matter with
meIm written out
Jim snorted For Heavens sake Kent Knowles he demanded how old
are you
Im thirtyeight according to the almanac but
Thirtyeight Why Thackeray wrote
Drop it I know when Thackeray wrote Vanity Fair as well as you do
Im no Thackeray to begin with and besides I am older at thirtyeight
than he was when he diedyes older than he would have been if he had
lived twice as long So far as feeling and all the rest of it go Im a
second Methusaleh
My soul hear the man And Im fortytwo myself Well Grandpa what do
you expect me to do get you admitted to the Old Mans Home
I expect I began I expect and I concluded with the lame
admission that I didnt expect him to do anything It was up to me to do
whatever must be done I imagined
He smiled grimly
Glad your senility has not affected that remnant of your commonsense
he declared Youre dead right my boy it IS up to you You ought to
be ashamed of yourself
I am but that doesnt help me a whole lot
Nothing will help you as long as you think and speak as you have this
morning See here Kent answer me a question or two will you They may
be personal questions but will you answer them
I guess so There has been what a disinterested listener might call
a slightly personal flavor to your remarks so far Do your worst Fire
away
All right Youve lived in Bayport ten years or so I know that What
have you done in all that timebesides write
Well Ive continued to live
Doubted Youve continued to exist but how Ive been here before
This isnt my first visit by a good deal Each time I have been
here your daily routineleaving out the exciting clam hunts and the
excursions in quest of the ferocious flounder like the one were
supposedmind I say supposedto be on at the present momentyou
have put in the day about like this Get up bathe eat walk to the
postoffice walk home sit about talk a little read some walk some
more eat again smoke talk read eat for the third time smoke talk
read and go to bed Thats the program isnt it
Not exactly I play tennis in summerwhen there is anyone to play with
meand golf after a fashion I used to play both a good deal when I
was younger I swim and I shoot a little andand
How about society Have any do you
In the summer when the city people are here there is a good deal
going on if you care for itpicnics and clam bakes and teas and lawn
parties and such
Heavens what reckless dissipation Do you indulge
Why nonot very much Hang it all Jim you know Im no society man
I used to do the usual round of fool stunts when I was younger but
But now youre too antique I suppose Wonder that someone hasnt
collected you as a genuine Chippendale or something So you dont tea
much
Not much Im not often invited to tell you the truth The summer
crowd doesnt take kindly to me Im afraid
Astonishing Youre such a chatty entertaining communicative cuss on
first acquaintance too So captivatingly loquacious to strangers I can
imagine how youd shine at a tea Every summer girl that tried to talk
to you would be frostbitten Do you accept invitations when they do
come
Not often nowadays You see I know they dont really want me
How do you know it
Whywell why should they Everybody else calls me
They call you a clam and so you try to live up to your reputation I
know you Kent You think yourself a tough old bivalve but the most
serious complaint you suffer from is ingrowing sensitiveness They do
want you Theyd invite you if you gave them half a chance Oh I know
you wont of course but if I had my way Id have you dragged by main
strength to every picnic and tea and feminine talkfest within twenty
miles You might meet some persevering female who would propose
marriage YOU never would but SHE might
I rose to my feet in disgust
Well go clamming said I
He did not move
We willlater on he answered We havent got to the last page
of the catechism yet I mentioned matrimony because a good capable
managing wife would be my first prescription in your case I have one
or two more up my sleeve Tell me this How often do you get away from
Bayport How often do you get towell to Boston well say How many
times have you been there in the last year
I dont know A dozen perhaps
What did you do when you went
Various things Shopped some went to the theater occasionally if
there happened to be anything on that I cared to see Bought a good many
books Saw the new Sargent pictures at the library Andand
And shook hands with your brother fossils at the museum I suppose
Wild life you lead Kent Did you visit anybody Meet any friends or
acquaintancesany live ones
Not many I havent many friends Jim you know that As for the wild
lifewell I made two visits to New York this year
Yes drily and we saw Sothern and Marlowe and had dinner at the
Holland The rest of the time we talked shop That was the first visit
The second was more exciting still we talked shop ALL the time and you
took the six oclock train home again
Youre wrong there I saw the new loan collections at the Metropolitan
and heard Ysaye play at Carnegie Hall I didnt start for home until the
next day
Is that so Thats news to me You said you were going that afternoon
That was to put the kibosh on my intention of taking you home to my wife
and her bridge party I suppose Was it
Wellwell you see Jim II dont play bridge and I AM such a
stick in a crowd like that I wanted to stay and you were mighty kind
butbut
All right All right my boy Next time it will be Bustanobys the
Winter Garden and a three A M cabaret for yours My time is coming
NowWell now well go clamming
He swung out of the armchair and walked to the top of the steps leading
down to the beach I was surprised of course I have known Jim Campbell
a long time but he can surprise me even yet
Here hold on I protested How about the rest of that catechism
Youve had it
Were those all the questions you wanted to ask
Yes
Humph And that is all the advice and encouragement Im to get from
you How about those prescriptions you had up your sleeve
Youll get those by and by Before I leave this gay and festive scene
tomorrow Im going to talk to you Hosea And youre going to listen
Youll listen to old Doctor Campbell HELL prescribe for you dont
you worry And now beginning to descend the steps now for clams and
flounders
And the Point Rip I added maliciously for his frivolous treatment
of what was to me a very serious matter was disappointing and
provoking Dont forget the Point Rip
We dug the clamsthey were for baitwe boarded the Hephzy sailed
out to the fishing grounds and caught flounders I caught the most of
them Jim was not interested in fishing during the greater part of the
time Then we sailed home again and walked up to the house Hephzibah
for whom my boat is named met us at the back door As usual her
greeting was not to the point and practical
Leave your rubber boots right outside on the porch she said Here
give me those flatfish Ill take care of em Hosy youll find dry
things ready in your room Heres your shoes Ive been warmin em Mr
Campbell Ive put a suit of Hosys and some flannels on your bed They
may not fit you but theyll be lots better than the damp ones youve
got on You neednt hurry dinner wont be ready till you are
I did not say anything I knew Hephzyhad known her all my life Jim
who naturally enough didnt know her as well protested
Were not wet Miss Cahoon he declared At least Im not and I
dont see how Kent can be We both wore oilskins
That doesnt make any difference You ought to change your clothes
anyhow Been out in that boat havent you
Yes but
Well then Dont say another word Ill have a fire in the
sittinroom and somethin hot ready when you come down Hosy be
sure and put on BOTH the socks I darned for you Dont get thinkin of
somethin else and come down with one whole and one holey same as you
did last time You must excuse me Mr Campbell Ive got saleratus
biscuits in the oven
She hastened into the kitchen When Jim and I having obeyed orders
to the extent of leaving our boots on the porch passed through that
kitchen she was busy with the teakettle I led the way through the
diningroom and up the front stairs My visitor did not speak until we
reached the second story Then he expressed his feelings
Say Kent he demanded are you going to change your clothes
Yes
Why Youre no wetter than I am are you
Not a bit but Im going to change just the same Its the easier
way
It is is it Whats the other way
The other way is to keep on those youre wearing and take the
consequences
What consequences
Jamaica ginger hot water bottles and an afternoons roast in front of
the sittingroom fire Hephzibah went out sailing with me last October
and caught cold That was enough no one else shall have the experience
if she can help it
Butbut good heavens Kent do you mean to say you always have to
change when you come in from sailing
Except in summer yes
But why
Because Hephzy tells me to
Do you always do what she tells you
Generally Its the easiest way as I said before
Goodheavens And she darns your socks and tells you whater lingerie
to wear anddoes she wash your face and wipe your nose and scrub behind
your ears
Not exactly but she probably would if I didnt do it
Well Ill be hanged And she extends the same treatment to all your
guests
I dont have any guests but you No doubt she would if I did She
mothers every stray cat and sick chicken in the neighborhood There
Jim you trot along and do as youre told like a nice little boy Ill
join you in the sittingroom
Humph perhaps Id better I may be spanked and put to bed if I dont
Well well and you are the author of The Black Brig Buccaneers and
Blood Bibs and Butterscotch it should be Dont stand out here in
the cold hall Hosy darling you may get the croup if you do
I was waiting in the sittingroom when he came down There was a roaring
fire in the big oldfashioned fireplace That fireplace had been
bricked up in the days when people used those abominations stoves As a
boy I was well acquainted with the old gas burner with the iron urn
on top and the nickeled ornaments and handles which Mother polished so
assiduously But the gas burner had long since gone to the junk dealer
Among the improvements which my first royalty checks made possible were
steam heat and the restoration of the fireplace
Jim found me sitting before the fire in one of the two big wing chairs
which I had purchased when Darius Barlays household effects were sold
at auction I should not have acquired them as cheaply if Captain Cyrus
Whittaker had been at home when the auction took place Captain Cy loves
oldfashioned things as much as I do and as he has often told me since
he meant to land those chairs some day if he had to run his bank account
high and dry in consequence But the Captain and his wifewho used to
be Phoebe Dawes our schoolteacher here in Bayportwere away visiting
their adopted daughter Emily who is married and living in Boston and
I got the chairs
At the Barclay auction I bought also the oil painting of the bark
Freedoma command of Captain Elkanah Barclay uncle of the late
Dariusand the settwo volumes missingof The Spectator bound in
sheepskin The Freedom is depicted Entering the Port of Genoa July
10th 1848 and if the port is somewhat wavy and uncertain the
barks canvas and rigging are definite and rigid enough to make up
The Spectator set is chiefly remarkable for its marginal notes Captain
Elkanah bought the books in London and read and annotated at spare
intervals during subsequent voyages His opinions were decided and his
notes nautical and emphatic Hephzibah read a few pages of the
notes when the books first came into the house and then went to
prayermeeting As she had announced her intention of remaining at home
that evening I was surpriseduntil I read them myself
Jim came downstairs arrayed in the suit which Hephzy had laid out for
him I made no comment upon his appearance To do so would have been
superfluous he looked all the comments necessary
I waved my hand towards the unoccupied wing chair and he sat down Two
glasses one empty and the other half full of a steaming mixture were
on the little table beside us
Help yourself Jim I said indicating the glasses He took up the one
containing the mixture and regarded it hopefully
What he asked
A Cahoon toddy said I Warranted to keep off chills rheumatism
lumbago and kindred miseries Good for what ails you Dont wait Ive
had mine
He took a sniff and then a very small sip His face expressed genuine
emotion
Whew he gasped choking What in blazes
Jamaica ginger sugar and hot water I explained blandly It
wont hurt youlonger than five minutes It is Hephzys invariable
prescription
Good Lord Did you drink yours
NoI never do unless she watches me
But your glass is empty What did you do with it
Emptied it behind the back log Of course if you prefer to drink it
Drink it His toddy splashed the back log causing a tremendous
sizzle
Before he could relieve his mind further Hephzy appeared to announce
