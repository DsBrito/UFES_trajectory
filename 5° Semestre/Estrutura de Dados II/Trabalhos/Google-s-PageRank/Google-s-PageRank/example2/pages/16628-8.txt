In view of their unwieldiness and size it is being urged that motor
charabancs should be required to carry a special form of hooter to be
sounded only when there is no room for a vehicle coming in the other
direction to pass A more elaborate system of signals is also suggested
notably two short squawks and a long groan to signify My pedestrian I
think
According to a County Court judge it is the duty of every motorist who
knocks down a pedestrian to go back and ask the man if he is hurt But
surely the victim cannot answer such a question offhand without first
consulting his solicitor

SOLVING THE HOLIDAY FARE PROBLEM
None but the rich can pay the fare is as true at this moment as when the
words were first penned
The reference of course is to the return fare for the single fare of
tomorrow is hardly more than we paid without complaint in years gone by for
the journey there and back
How comparatively few people seem to be aware that the solution of the
difficulty lies in not returning Could anything be simpler
Nobody wants to return In preparing for a holiday our thoughts are
concentrated on when to go where to go and how to get there Who bothers
himself about when to come back where to come back from and how to do it
After all holidaymaking is not to be confused with prizefighting
That we have come back in the past has been due as much to custom as to
anything Someone introduced the silly fashion of returning from holidays
and we have unthinkingly acquired the habit Once we shake off this holiday
convention the problem of the return fare is solved
Just stay where you are and all will be well Sooner or later your friends
or your employer if your return is really considered desirable will send
a moneyorder But that is their lookout The point is that the return
fare need not trouble you And you can please yourself as to what you buy
with the moneyorder
Why all this outcry then about the cost of travelling in the holiday

BADLY SYNGED
The scene is the morningroom of the SmithHybrows South London residence
It is the day following the final performance of the SmithHybrows
strenuous season of JM SYNGE drama undertaken with the laudable
intention of familiarising the suburb with the real Irish temperament and
the works of the dramatist in question
Mrs SmithHybrow is seated at the breakfasttable her head buried behind
the coffee urn She is opening her letters and keening softly as she
rocks in her chair
Mrs SmithHybrow scanning a letter Will I be helping them with the
sale of work Its little enough the like of me will be doing for them the
way I was treated at the last Bazaar when Mrs McGupperty and Mrs
GlynJones were after destroying me with the cutting of the sandwiches And
was I not there for three days from the rising of the blessed sun to the
shining of the blessed stars cutting and cutting and never a soul to bear
witness to the destroying labour of it and the two legs of me like to give
way with the great weariness keens Ill have no call this year to be
giving in to their prayers and beseechings and I wont care the way the
Curate will be after trying to come round me with his eyes looking at me
the way the moon kisses the drops of dew on the hedgerows when the road is
white
Opens another letter keening the while in a slightly higher key
Enter Gertrude SmithHybrow She crosses to the window and stares
out
Gertrude There are black clouds in the sky and the wind is breaking in
the west and making a great stir with the trees and they are hitting one
on the other And there is rain falling falling from the clouds and the
roads be wet
Mrs SH It is your mackintosh you will be wanting when you are after
going to the Stores
Gertrude coming to the table and speaking with dull resentment And
why should I be going to the Stores the way I have enough to do with a
meeting of the League for Brighter Homes and a luncheon of the Cubist
Encouragement Society Isnt it a queer hard thing that Dora cannot be
going to the Stores and her with time enough on her hands surely
Sits in her place and begins keening While she has been speaking
Dora has entered hurriedly buttoning her jumper
Dora vigorously And is it you Gertrude SmithHybrow that will be
talking about me having time on my hands May the saints forgive you for
the hard words and me having to cycle this blessed day to Mrs
Montgomerys lecture on the Dadaist Dramatists and the meringues and the
American creams to be made for tonights Tchekoff Conversazione Is it not
enough for a girl to be destroyed with the playacting and the wind like
to be in my face the whole way and the rain falling falling
Sits in her place and keens
Mrs SH after an interval of keening Is it your father that will
be missing his train this morning Dora SmithHybrow
Dora rousing herself and selecting an egg It is my father that will
be missing his train entirely and it is his son that would this minute be
sleeping the blessed daylight away had I not let fall upon him a sponge
that I had picked out of the cold cold water
Gertrude It is a flapper you are Dora SmithHybrow
Dora It is a flapper you will never be again Gertrude SmithHybrow
though you be after doing your queer best to look like one
Mrs SH Whisht Is it the time for loose talk with the wind rising
rising and the rain falling falling and the price of butter up another
threepence this blessed morning
They all three recommence keening Enter Mr SmithHybrow followed
by Cyril
Mr SH staunching a gash in his chin Is it not a hard thing for a
man to be late for his breakfast and the rain falling falling and the
wind rising rising Its destroyed I am with the loss of blood and no food
in my stomach would keep the life in a flea
Sits in his place and opens his letters savagely Cyril a
cadaverous youth stares gloomily into the depths of the marmalade
Cyril dreamily Theres gold and gold and goldcaverns of gold And
theres a woman with hair of gold and eyes would pick the locks of a mans
soul and long shining hands like pale seaweed Is it not a terrible thing
that a man would have to go to the City when there is a woman with gold
hair waiting for him in the marmalade potwaiting to draw him down into
the cold cold water
Dora Is it another spongeful you are wanting Cyril SmithHybrow and
myself destroyed entirely waiting for the marmalade
Cyril blushes passes the marmalade sits down languidly and selects
an egg Mrs SH pours out the coffee and resumes her keening
Mr SH glaring at her Is it not a nice thing for the wife of a
respectable City stockbroker to sit at the breakfasttable making a noise
like that of a cow that is waiting to be milked
Mrs SH hurt It is keening I am
Gertrude passing him The Morning Post Is it not enough that the
price of butter is up another threepence this blessed day and the wind
rising rising and the rain falling falling
Mr SH It is destroyed we shall all be entirely
Cyril gazing into the depths of his egg There was a strange queer
dream I was after having the night that has gone It was on the rocks I
was
Mr SH glaring at the market reports It is on the rocks we shall
all be
Cyril  on the rocks I was by the seashore
Dora slightly hysterically With the wind rising rising
Cyril nodding  and the rain falling falling And a woman of the
chorus drove up in a taxi and the man that had the driving of it was
eating an orange The woman came and sat by the side of me and the
peroxide in her hair made it gleam like the pale gold coins that were in
the banks before the Great War more dreamily Never a word said she
when I hung a chain of cold cold sausages about her neck but her eyes
were shining shining and into my hands she put a tin of corned beef And
it is destroyed I was with the love of her and would have kissed her lips
but I saw the parkkeeper coming coming out of the sea for tickets and I
fled from the strange queer terror of it and found myself by a lamppost
in Hackney Wick with the wind rising rising and the rain falling
falling
He stops The others stare at him and at one another in piteous
inquiry The women begin keening Mr SH seizes the remaining egg
and cracks it viciously
Mr SH falling back in his chair Damnation
The air is filled with a pungent matteroffact odour Dora
holding her handkerchief to her nose rushes valiantly at the offender
and hurls it out of the window on to a flowerbed The SYNGE spell is
broken

THE SUCCULENT COMEDIANS
Among the literary and artistic treasures of American collectors the
manuscript of LAMBS essay on Roast Pig is eminent I have seen this
rarity which is now in the strong room where Mr PIERPONT MORGAN keeps his
autographs safe equally from fire and from theftif not from the desire to
thieve Much did I covet in this realm of steel and LAMBS MS not least
The essay occupies both sides of large sheets of foolscap written in a
minute hand with very few corrections both the paper and the time
occupied in transcription if not also in actual composition being I
should guess the East India Companys It is not I imagine the first
draft but the first fair copy after all the changes had been made and the
form was fixed and its author if he is in any position to know what is
going forward on a planet which he left some sixandeighty years ago must
have been amused when he heard that so much moneythousands and thousands
of dollarshad been given for it at auction the other day
Reading the essay again in the faded ink on the yellowing paper I
realised once more that everything that can be said about little pigs dead
and ripe for the eater had been said here and said finally But the
living That very evening I was to find little live pigs working for their
maintenance under conditions of which I had never dreamed in an
environment less conducive one would suppose to porcine activity than any
that could be selected
It was at Coney Island that astonishing permanent and magnified Earls
Court Exhibition summer Blackpool and AugustBankHolidayHampsteadHeath
which New York supports for its beguilement In this domain of switchbacks
and chutes merrygorounds and shootinggalleries dancinghalls and
witching waves vociferous and crowded and lit by a million lamps I came
suddenly upon the Pig Slide and had a new conception of what quadrupeds can
do for man
The Pig Slide which was in one of the less noisy quarters of Luna Park
consisted of an enclosure in which stood a wooden building of two storeys
some five yards wide and three high On the upper storey was a row of six
or eight cages in each of which dwelt a little live pig an infant of a
few weeks In the middle of the row descending to the ground was an
inclined board with raised edges such as is often installed in swimming
baths to make diving automatic and beneath each cage was a hole a foot in
diameter The spectators and participants crowded outside the enclosure
and the thing was to throw balls which were hired for the purpose into
the holes Nothing could exceed the alert and eager interest taken by the
little pigs in the efforts of the ballthrowers They quivered on their
little legs they pressed their little noses against the bars of the cages
their little eyes sparkled their tails the only corkscrews left in
America curled and uncurled and curled again and with reason for
whereas if you missedas was only too easynothing happened if you
threw accurately the fun began and the fun was also theirs
This is what occurred First a bell rang and then a spring released the
door of the cage immediately over the hole which your ball had entered so
that it swung open The little pig within after watching the previous
infirmity of your aim with dejection if not contempt had pricked up his
ears on the sound of the bell and now smiled a gratified smile
irresistible in infectiousness and trotted out and with the smile
dissolving into an expression of absolute beatitude slid voluptuously down
the plank to be gathered in at the foot by an attendant and returned to
its cage all ready for another such adventure
It was for these moments and their concomitant changes of countenance that
you paid your money To taste the triumph of good marksmanship was only a
fraction of your joy the greater part of it consisted in liberating a
little prisoner and setting in motion so much ecstasy
We do not use baby pigs in this entertaining way in England At the most we
hunt them greased But when other beguilements weary we might The
RSPCA could not object the little pets are so happy And what a
privilege is theirs both alive and dead to enchant creations lord

Yawning it is now claimed is an excellent thing for the health
Stretched prone upon my couch of pain
An ache in every limb
Fell influenza having slain
My customary vim
I mused disconsolate about
The pattern of my pall
When lo I heard a step without
And Thomson came to call
Your ruddy health I told him mocks
A hand too weak to grip
The teacup with its captive ox
And raise it to my lip
To which he answered he had come
To bring for my delight
Red posies of geranium
And roses pink and white
Twas kind of Thomson thus to seek
To mitigate my gloom
But why did he proceed to speak
Of how hed reared each bloom
Telling in language far from terse
On what his blossoms fed
And how he made the greenfly curse
The day that it was bred
He told me how he rose at dawn
To titivate the land
Twas here that I began to yawn
Behind a courteous hand
And how he thought his favourite pea
Had found the soil too dry
And here I feared my yawns would be
Apparent to his eye
On fruit and blossom good and bad
He rambled on unchecked
Until his conversation had
Such curative effect
That in the end it drove away
My weak despondent mood
I clasped his hand and blessed the day
He came to do me good

NITRATES
All alone I went awalking by the London Docks one day
For to see the ships discharging in the basins where they lay
And the cargoes that I saw there they were every sort and kind
Every blessed brand of merchandise a man could bring to mind
There were things in crates and boxes there was stuff in bags and bales
There were teachests wrapped in matting there were Easternlooking
frails
There were baulks of teak and greenheart there were stacks of spruce and
pine
There was cork and frozen carcasses and casks of Spanish wine
There was rice and spice and cocoanuts and rum enough was there
For to warm all Londons innards up and leave a drop to spare
But of all the freights I found there gathered in from far and wide
All the smells both nice and nasty from the Pool to Barkingside
All the harvest of the harbours from Bombay to Montreal
There was one that took my fancy first and foremost of them all
It was neither choice nor costly it was neither rich nor rare
And in most ways you can think of it was neither here nor there
It was nothing overbeautiful to smell nor yet to see
Only bags of stuffy nitratebut it meant a lot to me
I forgot the swarming stevedores I forgot the dust and din
And the rattle of the winches hoisting cargo out and in
And the rusty tramp before me with her hatches open wide
And the grinding of her derricks as the sacks went overside
I forgot the murk of London and the dull November sky
I was far ay far from England in a day thats long gone by
I forgot the thousand changes years have brought in ships and men
And the knots on Times old logline that have reeled away since then
And I saw a fast fullrigger with her swelling canvas spread
And the steady tradewind droning in her royals overhead
Fleecy tradeclouds on the skylinehigh above the Tropic blue
And the curved arch of her foresail and the ocean gleaming through
I recalled the Cape Stiff weather when your soulcase seemed to freeze
And the trampling cursing watches and the pouring pooping seas
And the ice on spar and jackstay and the cracking volleying sail
And the tatters of our voices blowing down the roaring gale
I recalled the West Coast harbours just as plain as yesteryear
Nitrate ports all dry and dusty where they sell fresh waterdear
Little cities white and wicked by a bleak and barren shore
With an anchor on the cliffside for to show you where to moor
And the sour red wine we tasted and the foolish songs we sung
And the girls we had our fun with in the days when we were young
And the dancing in the evenings down at Dago Bills saloon
And the stars above the mountains and the seas eternal tune
Only bags of stuffy nitrate from a far Pacific shore
From a dreary West Coast harbour that Ill surely fetch no more
Only bags of stuffy nitrate with its faint familiar smell
Bringing back the ships and shipmates that I used to know so well
Half a lifetime lies between us and a thousand leagues of sea
But it called the days departed and my boyhood back to me

QUEENS COUNSEL
The Fairy Queen shook her head in answer to my question No she said I
have no favourite flower
She had dropped in after dinner as was her occasional habit and at the
moment sat perched on a big red carnation which stood in a flowerglass on
the top of my desk
You see she continued floating across to where I was sitting and
lowering her voice confidentially for there were a good many flowers
aboutyou see it would never do Just think of the trouble it would
cause Imagine the state of mind of the lilies if I were to show a
preference for roses Theres always been a little jealousy there and
theyre all frightfully touchy The artistic temperament you know Why I
darent even sleep in the same flower two nights running
Yes I see I said It must be very awkward
I lapsed into silence I had had a worrying day and was feeling tired and a
little depressed The Queen fluttered about the room pausing a moment on
the mantelshelf for a word or two with her old friend the Dresden china
shepherdess Then she came back to the desk and performed a brief pas
seul on the shining smooth cover of my passbook My mind flew instantly
to my slender bankbalance and certain recent foolishnesses
Talking of favourites I saidtalking of favourites do you take any
interest in racing
Instantly the Queen subsided on to my rubber stamp damper which was
fortunately dry
Oh yes she replied I take a great interest in racing I love it I
can give you all sorts of hints
I thought it was a pity she hadnt called a week or two earlier I might
have been a richer woman by a good many pounds
And there are so many kinds continued the Queen earnestly Now in a
butterfly race its always best just to hold on and let them do as they
like Its not a bit of use trying to make them go straight Rabbits are
better in that way but even rabbits are a little uncertain at times Full
of nerves But have you ever tried swallowracing she went on
enthusiastically Its simply splendid You give them their heads and you
never know where you may get to But anyway it doesnt really matter in
the least afterwards who wins its only while its happening that you feel
so thrilled isnt it
I didnt acquiesce very wholeheartedly Im afraid my thoughts were with
my lost guineas It had rather mattered afterwards I really had been
very foolish
You look depressed said the Fairy Queen Can I help you Im really
extremely practical You know dont you she leaned forward and looked at
me earnestly that I should be delighted if I could assist you with any
advice
I hesitated Just before she came I had been anxiously considering as to
how I was going to make one hundred pounds do the work of two during the
next few weeks but somehow I didnt quite like to mention such material
matters to the Queen it didnt seem suitable
I looked up and met her kind eyes fixed on mine with an expression of the
gentlest interest and solicitude
I wonder I said still hesitating whether you know anything about
stocks and shares
Stocks and shares she repeated slowly looking just a little vague and
puzzled And thenOh yes of course I do if thats all you want to
know
I felt quite pleased now that I had really got it out
If you could just give me a useful hint or two I should be tremendously
grateful I said Already thousands loomed entrancingly before me Already
I saw myself settled in that darling cottage on the windy hill above
Daccombe Wood Already
I think I had better get a pencil and paper I said My memorys
dreadful
But the Fairy Queen shook her head
Ill write it down for you she said and you can read it when Im gone
Thats so much more fun But I dont need paper
She drew a tiny shining implement from her pocket and picking up a couple
of rosepetals which had fallen upon the table she busied herself with
them for a moment at my desk her mouth pursed up her brows contracted in
an expression of intense seriousness
There she said thats that And now show me all your new clothes
We spent quite a pleasant evening over one thing and another and I forgot
all about the roseleaves until after she had gone but when I came back to
my empty sittingroom they shone in the dusk with a soft radiance which
came I discovered from the writing on them It glowed like those luminous
figures on watches which were so entrancing when they first appeared I had
never realised before that they were fairy figures
I spread the petals out on my palm feeling quite excited at the prospect
of making my fortune by such means though I was a little anxious as to how
I was going to make use of the information I was about to acquire
I will ask Cousin Fred I decided Cousin Fred being a stockbroker and
I smiled a little to myself as I thought how amazed and possibly amused my
dapper cousin would be when he learnt the source of my knowledge He might
even refuse to believe in itand then where should I be
I neednt have troubled When I unfolded my rosepetals this is what I
read
StocksThe white ones are much the best and have by far the sweetest
scent
