that he does not overrate what the present patronage of the public
encourages him to expect Indeed he would fear the suspicion
of ingratitude on his part were he not thus to acknowledge the
longextended success which has attended his labours from their
commencement to the present moment At the same time lest vanity
should be thought to have mastered his better judgment he assures
his patrons that he does not claim the undivided merit of his good
fortune since beyond his own taste of adaptation and selection
he misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on so that the
multiplicity of his resources being considered his success is
perhaps more complimentary to the discernment of the public than it
is laudatory of his individual exertions
As many readers would yawn over a long preface like so much Latin
the Editor will not in the present instance subject them to so
extraordinary a stretch of ennui by any lengthy comment on the
character of his last volume He hopes that its contents will be
found equal to either of its predecessors and if any superiority be
observed he begs that it may be attributed to the march of mind in
whose rank and file he may be allowed his proper order
Like the wellgraced actor who at the conclusion of a play bows
to the performers before he addresses the audience the Editor first
returns his acknowledgments to his several Correspondents who have
contributed to the public entertainment in his last volume perhaps
this class may be very small although in the usual proportion of
good and evil which is scattered up and down all paths of life To the
other and more numerous class viz those whose Communications from
various motives generally explained have not been inserted the
Editor is equally indebtedfor intention if not accomplishment and
he hopes that the performance of his critical duty has been such as
to conciliate their respect and goodwill As a pleasantry he would
remind a fair proportion of his readers that
As the young and forward bud
Is eaten by the canker ere it blow
Even so by love the young and tender wit
Is turned to folly blasting in the bud
Losing his verdure even in the prime
And all the fair effects of future hopes
for he would not affect the fickle guide on so extended a scale
For graver matters or such as are beyond the surface of the heart
the Editor thanks his Correspondents on subjects of Art in its
antiquarian and modern departments of whose researches he has
frequently availed himself With a view to keep pace with the Spirit
of Philosophical Discovery which characterizes the present day the
Editor has been his own Prometheus in introducing his readers to the
Arcana of Science the object of which has already been fully
explained and he hopes to a certain extent realized
The Editor is not disposed to indulge too freely in anticipation lest
he should lose sight of his object accordingly he must be brief in
his professions for the future Improvement is contemplated in the
general execution of the Embellishments as far as the Proprietor
and Editor have control but anon they will be at the bar of public
taste To use a parliamentary phrase other new features will be
introduced from time to time so as to continue to reflect in THE
MIRROR the characteristics and curiosity of the present day aided by
some of the bright lights of past ages

MEMOIR
OF
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF CLARENCE
LORD HIGH ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND
Ye sacred arks of Liberty that float
Where Tamars waters spread their bosom wide
That seem with towering stern and rampart stride
Like antique castles girt with shining moat
Should War the signal give with brazen throat
No more recumbent here in idle pride
Your rapid prows would cleave the foaming tide
And to the nations speak in thundering note
Thus in the firmament serene and deep
When summer clouds the earth are hanging oer
And all their mighty masses seem asleep
To execute Heavens wrath and judgment sore
From their dark wombs the sudden lightnings leap
And vengeful thunders peal along the shore
Forget Me Notfor 1828
The recent appointment of the above illustrious individual to the
head of our naval administration is a gratulatory topic for every
Englishman and we doubt not the measure will contribute as largely
to individual honour as it will to the national welfare In the
abstract nations resemble large families of which kings are fathers
or guardians and the subdivision of this guardianship or paternal
government among the sons or younger brothers of the sovereign is
calculated to promote unanimity among the governors and to engraft
with affectionate loyalty the hearts of the governed Indeed the
tutelar presence of princes seldom fails to inspire courage and to
support the patriotic sons of arms even in the extremes of danger
and although the princes of our times have seldom been distinguished
in the camp of warwe should recollect that
Nihil sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi
The DUKE of CLARENCE who is next brother to his present Majesty was
born at St Jamess Palace August 21 1765 at a quarter before four
in the morning and in the following month was baptized by the name of
WILLIAM HENRY It is said that in his childhood and youth it was the
frankness of his countenance and behaviour induced the king to devote
him to the naval service added to this he surpassed his brothers
in corporeal strength and constitutional hardihood although he was
exceeded by them in the more refined acquirements of study to which
he manifested comparative indifference With a mind naturally framed
for peril and enterprise and aware of the subordinate rank and
laborious stations through which he must pass to distinction he
appears to have been enthusiastic and impatient for the service
long before he entered the lists notwithstanding he commenced his
career at the age of fourteen by joining the Prince George a
ninetyeightgun ship recently built and named after his present
majesty In this ship under the command of Admiral Digby his royal
highness bore a part in the great naval engagement between the English
and Spanish fleets commanded by Admiral Rodney and Don Juan de
Langara Previous to his leaving the Prince George he was also
present at the capture of a French manofwar and three smaller
vessels forming part of a considerable convoy but in neither of
these instances was an opportunity offered for any distinguishing
effort of bravery On this occasion the Spanish admiral Don Juan
de Langara on visiting Admiral Digby was introduced to his royal
highness During the conference between the two admirals the prince
retired and when it was intimated that Don Juan wished to return
his royal highness appeared in the uniform of a midshipman and
respectfully informed the admiral that the boat was ready The
Spaniard was surprised to see the son of his Britannic majesty acting
in the capacity of an inferior officer and emphatically observed to
Admiral Digby Well does Great Britain merit the empire of the seas
when humble stations in her navy are filled by princes of the blood
We have next the pleasing duty of adverting to two signal exertions of
his royal highness in the cause of humanityconduct which
is twice blessd
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes
Tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown
The first is thus narrated by a midshipman of the Torbay in a letter
to his friends
Port Royal Harbour April 1783
The last time Lord Hoods fleet was here a courtmartial
was held on Mr Benjamin Lee midshipman for disrespect to
a superior officer at which Lord Hood sat as president The
determination of the court was fatal to the prisoner and he
was condemned to death Deeply affected as the whole body of
the midshipmen were at the dreadful sentence they knew not
how to obtain a mitigation of it since Mr Lee was ordered
for execution while they had not time to make their appeal
to the Admiralty and despaired of success in a petition to
Admiral Rowley However His Royal Highness generously stepped
forth drew up a petition to which he was the first to set
his name and solicited the rest of the midshipmen in port to
follow his example He then himself carried the petition to
Admiral Rowley and in the most pressing and urgent manner
begged the life of our unhappy brother in which he succeeded
and Mr Lee is reprieved We all acknowledge our warmest and
grateful thanks to our humane our brave and worthy prince
who has so nobly exerted himself in preserving the life of his
brother sailor
In the same year 1783 the prince then a fine midshipman visited
Cape Francois and the Havannah where the second instance of his
generous humanity occurred It should be premised that some of
his countrymen having broken their oath of fidelity to the Spanish
government were in danger of suffering under sentence of death The
governor of Louisiana Don Galvez offered at the intercession of the
prince to pardon them and the enthusiasm which he manifested in this
labour of love cannot be better illustrated than by the following
letter addressed by his royal highness to the governor
SirI want words to express to your Excellency my just
sense of your polite letter of the delicate manner in which
you caused it to be delivered and your generous conduct
towards the unfortunate in your power Their pardon which
you have been pleased to grant on my account is the most
agreeable present you could have offered me and is strongly
characteristic of the bravery and gallantry of the Spanish
nation This instance increases if possible my opinion of
your Excellencys humanity which has appeared on so many
occasions in the course of the late war
Admiral Rowley is to dispatch a vessel to Louisiana for
the prisoners I am convinced they will ever think of your
Excellencys clemency with gratitude and I have sent a
copy of your letter to the king my father who will be fully
sensible of your Excellencys attention to me
I request my compliments to Madame Galvez and that you will
be assured that actions so noble as those of your Excellency
will ever be remembered by
Yours sincerely WILLIAM P
On June 17 1785 after a service afloat of six years and three
months his royal highness was promoted lieutenant of the Hebe In ten
months after this we find him serving as captain of the Pegasus next
in the Andromeda and the Valiant and on December 3 1790 his royal
highness received a commission as rearadmiral of the blue having
then been about eighteen months a peer of England Scotland and
Ireland by the titles of duke of Clarence and St Andrews and earl
of Munster From this period till the year 1814 his royal highness
remained on shore On April 19 in that year he hoisted his flag on
board the Jason as admiral of the fleet and on the 23rd of the same
month he sailed from Dover with several other ships to escort Louis
XVIII to the coast of France and having seen him to Calais returned
to the Downs on the night of the 24th and struck his flag a few days
after1
During the period between the 25th of May and June 28th 1814 when
his royal highness finally took leave of the sea his flag was
hoisted successively in the Impregnable and Jason and again in the
Impregnable and from her transferred to the Magicienne in which last
ship he sailed on the 26th of June and having escorted the allied
sovereigns to the continent struck his flag and came on shore2
His royal highness service at sea may therefore be stated as
follows6 years as midshipman 11 months as lieutenant 3 years and
10 months as post captain and 7 weeks as admiral of the fleet making
a total service at sea of about 10 years and 9 months3
The intimacy of the prince with the gallant Nelson is well known as
one of the most interesting incidents of the dukes life They first
met at Quebec in 1782 when Nelson was in the Albemarle off that
station and whence he was ordered to convoy a fleet of transports
to New York From this time they became much attached and their
separation was the cause of mutual regret At the close of the war
they met again both being appointed to the Leeward island station
Nelson soon had an opportunity of witnessing the princes resolute
obedience to orders amidst great personal danger and strong
temptations to avarice the circumstances of which are briefly
as followThe law excluded all foreign vessels from trade and
intercourse with our West India islands and America being now
independent and as much a foreign nation as any other Nelson
the senior captain on the station ordered all American vessels to
quit the islands within fortyeight hours on pain of seizure and
prosecution of their owners Four vessels at Nevis remained which
he ordered to be searched and on being found American they were
adjudged legal prizes This proceeding placed Nelson in considerable
difficulty but he ultimately triumphed and though the thanks of
government for protecting its commerce were given to the admiral of
the station who had in fact opposed the measure Nelson was conscious
of having done his duty and enjoyed the approbation of such as were
disinterested witnesses of it Among these was Prince William who
thus notices Nelsons conduct on this occasion in a letter to a
friend It was at this era says the prince that I particularly
observed the greatness of Nelsons superior mind The manner in which
he enforced the spirit of the Navigation Act first drew my attention
to the commercial interests of my country We visited different
islands together and as much as the manoeuvres of fleets can be
described off the headlands of islands we fought over again the
principal naval actions in the American war Excepting the naval
tuition which I had received on board the Prince George when the
present Rear Admiral Keats was lieutenant of her and for whom we both
entertained a sincere regard my mind took its first decided naval
turn from this familiar intercourse with Nelson
It is also worthy of remark that while the prince spoke thus highly
of Nelson the latter estimated his royal highness in correspondent
terms In a letter to Captain Locker about the same period Nelson
says You must have heard long before this reaches you that Prince
William is under my command I shall endeavour to take care that he
is not a loser by that circumstance He has his foibles as well as
private men but they are far overbalanced by his virtues In his
professional line he is superior to near twothirds I am sure of
the list and in attention to orders and respect to his superior
officers I hardly know his equal His royal highness keeps up strict
discipline in his ship and without paying him any compliment she
is one of the finest ordered vessels I have seen These opinions
it should be recollected are quoted from private correspondencea
circumstance which adds materially to their value
On July 11 1818 his royal highness was married at Kew to her serene
highness Adelaide Amelia Louisa Theresa Caroline princess of Saxe
Meinengen eldest daughter of his serene highness the late reigning
duke of Saxe Meinengen The ceremony as is usual on these occasions
was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury in the presence of
all the royal family By this marriage his royal highness had one
daughter who was born March 27 1819 and died after a few hours In
1823 his royal highness was made a general of marines and within the
past year the duke has been appointed lord high admiral of England
It is not our intention here to enter into the supposed causes of
the dukes long seclusion from public service viz from 1790 to the
present time except a short interval in 1814 At the commencement of
the war with France the late Duke of York took an early and active
part by land hence the question arises as to the nonappointment of
the Duke of Clarence to a similar position by sea The consequence has
been that the most vigorous portion of the dukes life has been lost
to his country whilst his royal highness has remained in comparative
obscurity amidst one of the most brilliant periods of our naval
history It is however gratifying to know that the dukes inactivity
cannot be attributed to apathy on his part On the contrary he was
anxious to be employed and even sought appointment as appears by the
following letter written by his royal highness to Commodore Owen in
1812
Bath House Saturday night
DEAR SIRThis evening I received your letter from Deal
and in answer to it I beg to observe that I have made both
a public and private application to the king that I may be
permitted to hoist my flag and relieve Lord Collingwood in
the command of his majestys fleet in the Mediterranean There
cannot be any secrecy in this thing because before more
than fifty brother officers I declared my resolution at
Portsmouth Until I have the order to hoist my flag I cannot
be certain but I am very much inclined to think eventually
that I shall have the honour and the happiness of commanding
those fine fellows whom I saw in the spring in the Downs and
lately at Portsmouth My short stay at Admiral Campbells had
impressed me with very favourable ideas of the improved state
of the navy but my residence at Portsmouth has afforded me
ample opportunity of examining and consequently of having
a perfect judgment of the high and correct discipline now
established in the kings service    I could not resist
what I felt and reasons both public and private urged me to
make the offer I have already mentioned and I hope I shall be
gratifiedI remain dear sir yours c
WILLIAM
These zealous sentiments are however further corroborated by a
recent declaration of the duke to the Goldsmiths Company on their
presenting him with the freedom of their society
Having sketched the principal circumstances which appertain to what
may be termed the public career of his royal highness it is our
less pleasant though equally important duty to notice his domestic
life for obvious reasons our details will be less perfect It is
a portion of the dukes life which cannot be entirely passed over in
silence since it must be conceded that much of his unpopularity may
be traced to this source Neither the court nor the people of England
are so ascetic as not to extenuate the indiscretions of royalty but
this charitable estimate of misgivings does not extend to approbation
of any culpable dereliction of social and moral duties The fact of
his royal highness having a large family by a lady now no more is
too well known to be concealed but the odium attached to his royal
highness for his participation in a certain scene of license and
poverty has doubtless been overrated but his proportion must be
left for the biographer of a future age to settle and we sincerely
hope that to quote a contemporary when the time arrives that the
historian shall feel himself at liberty to enter into details and
sift matters to the bottom his royal highness will come out of the
investigation not without some blame for which of us is faultless
but with a character unsullied even in this respect and in
all other respects irreproachable Mankind are more or less the
children of error but their propensity to exaggerate human frailty
deserves to be reprobated for its cruelty and wickedness
The happy marriage of his royal highness to which event we have
already alluded has we trust been the means of clearing away the
prejudices which the dukes former conduct may have engendered
There is a tide in the affairs of man
Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune
This period of his royal highness life has probably arrived and
his appointment to the important office of Lord High Admiral will
doubtless accelerate the beneficial effect The public are perhaps
sanguine in their expectations but from early and subsequent proofs
of the dukes devotion and attachment to the service over which he now
presides we have reason to think they will not be disappointed It
has been shown that his royal highness neither wanted zeal nor ability
at any stage of his life and the ardent assurances which have been
quoted from one of his most recent declarations bespeak that he still
possesses the vigour of manhood tempered with experience and it must
be truly gratifying to his royal highness to know that the honour and
authority of the office of Lord High Admiral have been revived after
the sleep of a century as if to compensate him for past neglect with
their investiture4 In truth the alacrity with which the duke has
already entered into the duties of his office and the lively sense of
justice he has manifested in dispensing its honorary rewards must be
gladly hailed by the service and the country at large

The Duke of York is acknowledged by Mr Peel in his speech Feb 17

We subjoin the following characteristic anecdote from the New Sailors
Magazine for December 1827 sketched with fidelity and in that
rich vein of humour by which stories of the service are usually
distinguished It exhibits the character of his royal highness in all
the glowing generosity of buoyant youth and proves him to possess a
warmhearted sympathy for the sufferings of his fellowcreatures
THE ROYAL REEFER AND BOB CLEWLINES
It was on one of those December days when the wind blowing from
the northward acts almost like a razor on the surface of the skin
and when accompanied by small sharp rain a mixture of damp and
cold produce a chilling effect upon the frame and spirits that a
cidevant midshipman his hands in his pockets and
Whistling as he went for want of thought
crossed Londonbridge which at that time was an asylum to the
footsore the pauper and the weary of heart The day had fallen and
every thing looked dull and dreary the footpath was encumbered by
mud and porters carrying weights as well as other busy passengers
were jostling each other to obtain a footing on the dirty pavement
a fellow heavy laden came in contact with the royal reefer6 so
powerfully that he took a leelurch and got foul of one of the seats
in the arches Avast there luff up you lubberly rigged son of a
gun cried middy couldnt you hail ship before you were aboard of
us The fellow however waddled on but the middy had to turn about
in order to regain his course when suddenly he beheld a middleaged
figure perishing with cold a red nightcap on an old jacket and
trousers a pair of shoes in rags attached to his legs with a ropes
end no shirt no stockings nor any other attire the face was
climatestruck it had braved the equator and the pole the battle
and the breeze the scorching heat and the petrifying coldit was
as might be expected thin and moreover almost lost in a profusion
of hair on each cheek so that it would be difficult for the oldest
acquaintance to recognise the features after long absence nature had
made the lips to smile the eyes to beam in kindness the fine high
forehead to command respect but time and hardships disease and
disappointment had quenched the fire of the organ of sight and
intelligence the mirror of the soulhad prematurely furrowed that
front of honest English high spirit and candour and had taught the
lips to fall in dejection and the treasured silence of woe upon the
whole the figure had something fierce in it but it was truly manly
the warriors arms were folded together and his face bent towards
the ground was still half upturned and seemed to say to rich
merchants and venders passing by on foot and in carriages There ye
are ye liers upon beds of down ye feeders upon the poor mans toil
often have you slept secure and safely enjoyed your wealth whilst
poor Jack rode out the gale hung on the rigging betwixt life and
death and endured the storm which held him every moment betwixt
the chance of clinging to a fragment of the wreck and sinking into
eternity but now the war is over smartmoney paid for a sharp
wound and neglect and oblivion are the seamans portion The
expression of his face and eyes seemed to speak thus indeed it spoke
volumes but its mute appeal was lost on the worldlings who brushed
by him and who bent on love of gain scarcely were aware that their
fellowman was starving by their side too feeble and too much an
outcast to work yet too proud to beg the middys heart however was
of that texture that it leant towards a brothersailor meet him where
it might and he naturally looked round at poor Jack on his beamends
he had but one penny in his pocket and that the plaintive voice of
a blind woman had drawn as if by magic from its deep recess What
was to be donefor he should have liked to have taken this wreck of
a man of war into tow The reflection caused him to examine more
closely the shivering seaman when a small scar occasioned by a
splinter on the bridge of the nose brought to his remembrance Bob
Clewlines who had served in the same ship the tar recognised him
also but so far from making himself known to him he hid his face
in his hand the reefer however was resolved to bring him to What
Bob Clewlines cried he do I not hail an old shipmate in you a
quartermaster on board the  the bravest heart of oak the best
reefer and the merriest steersman of the whole ships crew and
said he audibly that every one passing might hear and value fallen
courage and fidelity and as prime a seaman as ever trimmed a sail
or served a gun why what has broke up your old hulk this way The
man could not find utterance remembrance of unrequited services
and other associations checked him The middy stretched out his hand
which the brokenhearted sailor ventured not to take Come Bob
cried the other no subordination now we are all equals on lifes
quarterdeck and when my fellowman suffers he rises a peg in
my estimation Whybecause unfeeling lubbers slight him Come tip
us your fin Your hand may be dirty but your soul is as kind as a
new sail in a sunny day Ill show it against any lords in the land
Come heave a head follow me old tarry breeches Ill soon set your
timbers and rigging to rights you shall have an entire refit
Come bear a hand set all your canvass its all in ribbons I
see and shivers in the wind but Ill keep out wind and weather for
you
Thus saying he walked proudly with the poor tar astern of him until
he came to a slopshop near Wellclose square it was a Jews Here
Moses quoth the middy who detected the Israelite bending looks
