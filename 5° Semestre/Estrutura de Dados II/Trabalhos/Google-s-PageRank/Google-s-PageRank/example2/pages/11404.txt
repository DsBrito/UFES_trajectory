TEMPLE AT ABURY
To the Editor of the Mirror
There is an inconsistency in the account of Abury in No 341 perhaps
overlooked by yourself
I would ask how could that arrangement of the fabric so fancifully
and ingeniously described by Stukely be intended to represent the
Trinity when the place was confessedly in existence long anterior to
Christianity nor is there any thing in the old Druidical or Bardic
tenets that can be twisted to any such idea
This Abury with Silbury is supposed to be the Cludair Cyfrangon
or Heaped Mound of Congregations mentioned in the Triads the
building of which is recorded as one of the three mighty achievements of
the Isle of Britain and here were held the general assemblies of the
Britons on religious occasions and not at Stonehenge as is generally
supposed This last place is decidedly more modern than the pile at
Abury the Welsh call it Gwaith Emrys the work of Emrys and it
ranks as another of the mighty achievements of the Isle of Britain the
third being the raising of the Stone of Keti supposed to be the Maen
Ceti at Gwyr in Glamorganshire
The presumption that Stonehenge is more modern than Abury is founded
upon the fact that Stonehenge exhibits marks of the chisel in different
parts while the former does not The ancient British documents give us
the founder of the latter namely Emrys or Ambrosius while we are
left in ignorance as to who raised the pile of Cyfrangon
Nor was Stonehenge ever of such magnitude as Abury the diameter of the
former being 99 feet whilst the latter was 1400 the largest stones of
the former weigh 30 tons but the latter weigh 100 tons
Gwaith Emrys was possibly more for political than religious assemblies
Here was held the meeting of the Britons and Saxons when the Plot of
the Long Knives Twyll y Cyllyll Hirion was consummated and the
flower of the British chiefs treacherously destroyed by their pretended
friends
Different authors have strenuously contended for giving the honour of
supremacy to either of these places over both Britain and Gaul in the
days of Druidism but Rowlands has industriously placed its chief seat in
Anglesey

Quod fuit esse quod est quod non fuit esse quod esse
Esse quod est non esse quod est non erit esse
As a translation of this curious epitaph in Lavenham churchyard which
is formed out of two Latin words has been requested from some of your
readers I send the following
What John Giles has been
Is what he is a bachelor
What he has not been
Is what he is a corpse
To be what he is
Is not to be a living creature
He will have to be
What he is not dust

What we have been and what we are
The present and the time thats past
We cannot properly compare
With what we are to be at last
Tho we ourselves have fancied forms
And beings that have never been

MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS
For the Mirror
The ensuing letter though very short discloses one or two instances
connected with a subject of unfading interestthe death of Mary Queen
of Scots It need hardly be stated says an able writer on this subject
that Queen Elizabeths conduct with respect to the execution of Mary was
a mixture of unrelenting cruelty despicable cowardice and flagitious
hypocrisy that whilst it was the dearest wish of her heart to deprive
her kinswoman of her existence she attempted to remove the odium of the
act from herself by endeavouring to induce those to whose custody she
was intrusted to assassinate their prisoner that when she found she
could not succeed she commanded the warrant to be forwarded and that
when she knew it was too late to recall it asserted that she never
intended it should be carried into execution threw herself into a
paroxysm of affected rage and grief upbraided her counsellors and
first imprisoned and then sacrificed the fortunes of her poor secretary
Davison one of her most virtuous servants as a victim to her own fame
and the resentment of the King of Scots These damning facts in the
character of Elizabeth are too well known to require to be dilated on
they have eclipsed the few noble actions of her life and remain
indelible spots on her reputation as a woman and a sovereign But we
learn from this letter the humiliating effects made by her ministers
to appease her fury and her implacable resolution to overwhelm the
unfortunate Davison with the effect of her assumed or perhaps real
repentance In his apology that statesman informs us that on the
Friday after Marys execution namely on the 10th of February arriving
at the court he learnt the manner in which the queen had expressed
herself relative to the event but being advised to absent himself for
a day or two and being moreover extremely ill he left the court
and returned to London Woolleys communication being dated on Sunday
the manuscript is so excessively badly written as to be almost
illegible shows that Elizabeth did not summon her council and evince
her displeasure at their conduct until Saturday the 13th of February
two days after she was informed of Marys fate Davison had been
attacked with a stroke of the palsy shortly before and all he says of
his committal is that he was not sent to the Tower until Tuesday the
14th on account of his illness though some days previous probably on
Saturday the 10th the queen assembled her council
This letter also exhibits a specimen of Leicesters characteristic
meanness for notwithstanding that he was a party to the act of
forwarding the warrant for Marys death as his name occurs among those
of the council who signed the letters to the Earl of Shrewsbury the earl
marshal and to the Earl of Kent both of which were dated on the 3rd of
February 15867 commanding them to cause it to be put into execution
he took care to withdraw from court before Elizabeth performed the roll
which has so justly excited the scorn of posterity It may be also
remarked as another example of the official duplicity of the period
that Sir Francis Walsingham likewise affected not to have been concerned
in the affair of dispatching the warrant as in his letter to Lord
Thulstone the secretary to King James dated at Greenwich on the 4th of
March 15867 less than a month afterwards he says Being absent from
court when the late execution of the queen your sovereign mother
happened though we find that he signed both the letters just mentioned

A VISIT TO STUDLEY PARK AND FOUNTAINS ABBEY YORKSHIRE
With a Notice of the Roman Military Road leading from Aldborough the
Isurium of the Romans to the North
Yet still thy turrets drink the light
Of summer evenings softest ray
And ivy garlands green and bright
Still mantle thy decay
And calm and beauteous as of old
Thy wandring river glides in gold
AA WATTS
Among the most attractive scenes of northern Yorkshire is Studley Park
renowned for the richness of its sylvan scenery which embosoms the noble
ruin of Fountains Abbey
For the date of my visit to this Arcadia I must refer the reader to
that season of life when the pure source of thought and feeling is
untainted by the world It is eleven miles from my home to Studley Park
five of which I walked in the twilight of a summers evening and slept
at a little cottage by the way The day had been sultry and the moon
rose slowly over the mounds of Maiden Bower once the site of the noble
mansion of the Percys now destroyed and desolate2 and fell in dreary
softness on tower and wood illumining the sable firs of Newby Park and
throwing another lustre on the gaudy gowans that decked the adjacent
meadow Here was a scene for the poetic sympathy of youth
That time is past
And all its giddy rapture
Yet not for this faint I nor mourn
Other gifts have followed for such loss
I would believe abundant recompense
WORDSWORTH
The morning found me after an early breakfast on the road to Studley
Park Now there are some moods of my own mind in which I detest all
vehicles of conveyance when on an excursive tour to admire the antique
and picturesqueThus what numerous attractions are presented to us
sauntering along the woody lane on foot which are lost or overlooked
in the velocity of a drive On the declivity of a meadow inviting our
reflection rises a little Saxon church grey with antiquity and
solemnized by its surrounding memorials of Here liesAcross the
heath encircled with fences of uncouth stones stands a stern record
of feudal yore at the next turn peeps the rectory encircled with old
firs trained fruit trees and affectionate ivy beneath yon darkened
thickets rolls the lazy Ure expanding into laky broadness and beyond
yon western woods which embower the peaceful hamlet are seen the
everlasting hills across which the enterprising Romans constructed
their road I next passed the boundaries of Newby Park the property of
Lord Grantham Here beneath enormous beeches were clustering the timid
deer in sunshine remote and the matin songs of birds were sounding
from the countless clumps which skirt this retreat Within that solitude
had I enjoyed the society of a brother alas now no more and yet the
landscape wore the same sunny smile as when I carved his name on the
towering obelisk before him I felt that sorrow so exquisitely described
by Burns
How can ye bloom so fresh and fair
How can ye chant ye little birds
And I so weary fu o care
Leaving Rainton a sudden rise brings you to the Roman Military Road
leading from Aldborough3 the Isurium of the Romans to Inverness in
Scotland This road was repaired by the Empress Heleanae and hence the
corruption from her name of Learning Lane its present designation
It was laid by the Romans with stones of immense size which have
frequently been dug up The Via Appia at Rome which has lasted
1800 years resembles it in construction Raised considerably above the
level of the country which it crosses it is an object of wonder and
interest even to the illiterate on account of the continuous perspective
it presents there being no bend in it for several miles Traversing
this noble monument of art how are we led to think on the strange
mutations which have overthrown kings and kingdoms in the period of its
duration whilst the road remains like an eternity
ON CROSSING THE ROMAN MILITARY ROAD LEADING FROM ISURIUM TO THE NORTH
Oer classic ground my humble feet did plod
My bosom beating with the glow of song
And highborn fancy walkd with me along
Treading the earth Imperial Caesar trod
A thousand rural objects on the way
Had been my themebut faroff years arose
When ancient Britain bowd beneath her foes
Adding resplendence to great Caesars day
When sounds of Roman arms through valley rung
And rose that glorious morn upon our isle
No night can hide or cloud conceal its smile
That dazzling morn which out of darkness sprung
Enduring cenotaph of Roman fame
More than this record of their mighty name
I reached the ancient town of Ripon as the bells were merrily ringing in
the towers of its old collegiate minster for it was the anniversary of
its patron saint St Wilfred After refreshment and a walk of three
miles I arrived at Studley Park The fairy effect produced on entering
this beautiful retreat is almost indescribable We suddenly exchange the
field and forest scenery for all the poetry of prospect On the right is
a declivity clothed with laurel and stretching far away and on the left
a lofty and well trimmed fence of laurel forms a screen or curtain to
the valley beneath the sighing of distant woods and the dashing of
waterfalls break on the enraptured ear and cause the anxious eye to
long for some opening in the verdant shroud Anon the valley is seen and
through an aperture in the laurel wall cut in imitation of a window
breaks as sweet a scene as ever Claude immortalized Unwilling to
hazard a formal description I will merely attempt an outline Far below
the silver waters of the Skell meander softly amongst statues of
tritons throwing up innumerable fountain streams These are masterly
executions after the ancient sculptors and give the scene an air of
Grecian classicality Around these triumphs of art rise lofty woods of
graceful birch varied by dark fir and interspersed with erections of
Roman and Gothic design It is in the contemplation of these beauties
that fancy recalls the mythology of rocky woods peopled with Dryads and
Fauns Passing by a circuitous path to the other side of this Eden by
sloping walks shaded with ilex ancient oak sycamore cypress and bay
we have a view of the extent of the valley terminating with the ruins of
Fountains Abbey and flanked by rocks wildly overgrown with shrubs
and before us seen more distinctly are the statues of Hercules and
Antaeus and a Dying Gladiatorthe Temple of Piety in which are
bronze busts of Titus Vespasian and Nero and a fine basrelief of the
Grecian Daughter In front of this temple the water assumes a variety of
fantastical forms ornamented at different points by statues of Neptune
Bacchus Roman Wrestlers Galatea c The banquetinghouse contains a
Venus de Medicis and a painting of the Governor of Surat on horseback
in a Turkish habit on the front of this building are spirited figures
of Envy Hatred and Malice From the octagon tower Mackershaw Lodge
and Wood are seen to great advantage and from the Gothic temple the
dilapidated abbey is an object of striking solemnity whilst an opening
in the distance shows the venerable towers of Ripon Minster
Wandering eastward we arrive at the precincts of Fountains Abbey which
gradually presents its monastic turrets midway in a dell skirted by
hills crowned with trees and varied by rocky slopes to the brook This
abbey was founded in consequence of the disgust which certain monks of
the Benedictine order at St Marys York had imbibed against their
relaxed discipline when struck with the famed austerities of the monks
of Rievaulx they left their abode and retired to this valley under the
shade of seven yew trees six of which were in 1818 standing The abbey
was destroyed in the reign of Stephen and rebuilt in 12044 The
present ruin is celebrated for the sublimity of its architecture many
parts of which are as perfect as when first erected The tower is 160
feet in height and is a fine specimen of Gothic in its best taste It
may with safety be asserted that no church or abbey in England can boast
of such an elegant elevation The cloisters 270 feet in length and
divided by 19 pillars and 20 arches extend across the rivulet which
is arched over to support them and near to the south end is a large
circular stone basin This almost subterranean solitude is dimly lighted
by lancet windows which are partially obscured by oaks beeches and
firs and the gloom is heightened by the brook beneath which may be seen
stretching its way through the broken arches The only tomb in the church
is that of a crosslegged knight which lies near the grand tower and
represents one of the Mowbrays who died at Ghent in 1297 Near the
altar is a stone coffin in which according to Dugdale Lord Henry
Percy was interred in 1315 Contiguous to the church is an extensive
quadrangular court which has been converted into a flower garden On
the east side is a line of beautiful arches under one of which is the
entrance to the chapterhouse a weedgrown solitude of deadly silence
Where the fullvoiced choir
Lie with their hallelujahs quenchd like fire
In 1791 by the removal of some fragments of ruin in the chapterhouse
the sepulchres of several of the abbots were discovered but the
inscriptions were obliterated Over the chapterhouse were the library
and scriptorium The architecture or Fountains Abbey is mixed in some
parts are seen the sharppointed windows in others the circular arches
The great eastern window is indescribably magnificent being 23 feet in
width There has been a central tower which has long since fallen to
decay The sanctum sanctorum is 131 feet in length over one of its
eastern windows is the figure of an angel holding a scroll dated 1283
The total length of the church is 358 feet On the north side of the
quadrangular court is the refectory which was supported by large pillars
and adjoining it is the reading gallery where portions of the Scriptures
were delivered to the monks whilst at their meals by the side of it are
the kitchen and scullery the former remarkable for its spacious arched
fire place Over the refectory was the dormitory which contained 40
cells and under the crumbling steps leading to it is the porters lodge
Near to the refectory are the remains of the abbots chambers
But adieu to the waning glory of Fountains Abbey and the receding towers
of Ripon Minster while retracing my path of yesterday morning I must
linger awhile on the Roman way where antiquity maintains her supremacy
in spite of the war of time and where the earth looks immutable Now the
groves of Newby Park reappear with their sylvan majesty creating
unutterable sympathies for the wind that bows the surrounding branches
moves me to weep for that romantic spirit whose ashes moulder on the
shores of India where
When the suns noonglory crests the wave
He shines without a shadow on his grave

PALEY
Paley would employ himself in his Natural Theology and then gather his
peas for dinner very likely gathering some hint for his work at the same
time He would converse with his classical neighbour Mr Yates or he
would reply to his invitation that he could not come for that he was
busy knitting  He would station himself at his garden wall which
overhung the river and watch the progress of a castiron bridge in
building asking questions of the architect and carefully examining
every pin and screw with which it was put together He would loiter along
a river with his anglerod musing upon what he supposed to pass in the
mind of a pike when he bit and when he refused to bite or he would
stand by the seaside and speculate upon what a young shrimp could mean
by jumping in the sun
With the handle of his stick in his mouth he would move about his garden
in a short hurried step now stopping to contemplate a butterfly a
flower or a snail and now earnestly engaged in some new arrangement of
his flowerpots
He would take from his own table to his study the backbone of a hare or
a fishs head and he would pull out of his pocket after a walk a plant
or stone to be made tributary to an argument His manuscripts were as
motley as his occupations the workshop of a mind ever on the alert
evidences mixed up with memorandums for his will an interesting
discussion brought to an untimely end by the hiring of servants the
letting of fields sending his boys to school reproving the refractory
members of an hospital here a dedication there one of his childrens
exercisesin another place a receipt for cheap soup He would amuse his
fire side by family anecdoteshow one of his ancestors and he was
praised as a pattern of perseverance separated two pounds of white and
black pepper which had been accidentally mixedpatiens pulveris he
might truly have added and how when the Paley arms were wanted
recourse was had to a family tankard which was supposed to bear them but
which he always took a malicious pleasure in insisting had been bought at

Portsmouth Literary and Philosophical Society
We have been much interested with the report of this Society for 18278
and we are happy to record the prosperity of the establishment Some
of the lectures especially those on Geology or Mineralogy are very
attractive and in the curators report we notice that the Museum
previously rich in fossil organic remains has been enriched by numerous
donations in this department during the past session The entire number
of specimens in the Museum is upwards of 9000
We have not been at Portsmouth for these three years and till we saw
this report were not aware that the State Chambers lately on the
Platform Battery had been pulled down towards the close of last year
The building was of some interest It was of stone with walls of
considerable thickness and square vaults below descending to a level
with the parade and used at different periods as dungeons The part on
which the vane stood was erected in the reign of Queen Elizabeth and
the other part was built in the time of Charles II whose name with the
date was on a marble slab above the doorway Of late years the building
had been modernized and used as a signalhouse and subscription
readingroom If we are not mistaken the edifice had often been much
injured by the encroachments of the sea and probably this led to its
removal
