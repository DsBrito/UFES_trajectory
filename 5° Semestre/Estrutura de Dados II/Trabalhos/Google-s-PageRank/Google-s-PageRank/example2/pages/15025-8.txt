PROSE FANCIES
A SPRING MORNING
I
Spring puts the old pipe to his lips and blows a note or two At the
sound little thrills pass across the wintry meadows The bushes are
dotted with innumerable tiny sparks of green that will soon set fire to
the whole hedgerow here and there they have gone so far as those little
tufts which the children call bread and cheese A gentle change is
coming over the grim avenue of the elms yonder They wont relent so far
as to admit buds but there is an unmistakable bloom upon them like the
promise of a smile The rooks have known it for some weeks and already
their Jews market is in full caw The more complaisant chestnut dandles
its sticky knobs Soon they will be brusselssprouts and then they will
shake open their fairy umbrellas So says a child of my acquaintance The
waterlilies already poke their green scrolls above the surface of the
pond a few buttercups venture into the meadows but daisies are still
precious as asparagus The air is warm as your loves cheek golden as
canary It is all aclink and aglitter it trills and chirps on every
hand Somewhere close by but unseen a young man is whistling at his
work and putting your ear to the ground you shall hear how the earth
beneath is alive with a million little beating hearts Cest lheure
exquise
Presently along the road comes slowly and at times erratically a
charming procession Following the fashion or even setting it three
weeks since yon old sow budded From her side recalling the Trojan horse
sprang suddenly a little company of blackandtan piglets fully legged
and snouted for the battle of life She is taking them with her to put
them to school at a farm two or three miles away So I understand her
They surround her in a compact body ever moving and poking and
squeaking yet all keeping together As they advance slowly she towering
above her tiny bodyguard one thinks of Gulliver moving through Lilliput
and there is a touch of solemnity in the procession which recalls a mighty
Indian idol being carried through the streets with people thronging about
its feet How delicately she steps lest she hurt one of the little limbs
And meanwhile mark the driverfor though the old pig pretends to ignore
any such coercion as men believe in freewill yet there is a fate a
driver to this idyllic domestic company But how gentle is he too He
never lets it be seen that he is driving them He carries a little switch
rather it would appear for forms sake for he seldom does more with it
than tickle the gravely striding posteriors of the quaint little people
He is wise as he is kind for he knows that he is driving quicksilver The
least undue coercion the least sudden start and they will be off like
spilled marbles in eleven different directions Sometimes occasion arises
for prompt action when the poet of the family dreams he discerns the
promised land through the bottom of a gate and is bent on squeezing his
way under and the demoralisation of the whole eleven seems imminent
Then unconsciously applying the wisdom of Solomon the driver deals a
smart flick to the old mother Seeing her move on and reflecting that she
carries all the provisions of the party her children think better of
their romance and gambol after her taking a gamesome pull at her teats
from high spirits
The man never seems to get angry with them He is smiling gently to
himself all the time as he softly and leisurely walks behind them
Indeed wherever this moving nursery of young life passes it awakens
tenderness The man who drove the gig so rapidly a little way off suddenly
slows down and with a sympathetic word walks his horse gingerly by
Every pedestrian stops and smiles and on every face comes a transforming
tenderness a touch of almost motherly sweetness So dear is young life to
the eye and heart of man
A few weeks hence these same pedestrians will pass these same pigs with
no emotion beyond possibly that produced by the sweet savour of frying
ham Their naivete their charming baby quaintness will have departed
for ever Their features as yet but roguishly indicated will have become
set and hidebound their soft little snouts will be ringed and hard as a
fifth hoof their dainty little earsveritable silk purseswill have
grown long and bristly in short they will have lost that ineffable
tender bloom of young life which makes them quite a touching sight today
Strange that loss of charm which comes with development in us all pigs
included A tendency to pigginess as in these youngsters a tendency to
manhood in the prattling and crowing babe are both hailed as charming
but the fullgrown pig the fullgrown man Alas in each case the charm
seems to flee with the advent of bristles
But let us return to the driver
Under his arm he carries a basket from which now and again proceed
suppressed squeaks and grunts It is the rickling the weakling of the
family It will probably find an early death and be embalmed in sage and
onions The man has already had an offer for itfrom Mr Lamb Mr
Lamb Yes Mr Lamb at SixElm Farm Oh I see But was it not a
startling coincidence
It has taken half an hour to come from the old bridge to the crossroads
barely half a mile And now goodbye funny little silkencoated piglets
goodbye grave old mother Gewhoop Goodbye gentle driver As you move
behind your charge with that tender smile with that burden safely pressed
beneath your arm I seem to have had a vision of the Good Shepherd
II
Down by the river there is as yet little sign of spring Its bed is all
choked with last years reeds trampled about like a manger Yet its
running seems to have caught a happier note and here and there along its
banks flash silvery wands of palm Right down among the shabby burntout
underwood moves the sordid figure of a man He seems the very genius
loci His clothes are torn and soiled as though he had slept on the
ground The white lining of one arm gleams out like the slashing in a
doublet His hat is battered and he wears no collar I dont like staring
at his face for he has been unfortunate Yet a glimpse tells me that he
is far down the hill of life old and drinkcorroded at fifty He is
miserably gathering sticksperhaps a little job for the farm close by He
probably slept in the barn there last night turned out drunk from the
publichouse He will probably do and be done by likewise tonight How
many faggots to the dram one wonders What is he thinking as he rustles
about disconsolately among the bushes Of what is he dreaming What does
he make of the lark up there But I notice he never looks at it Perhaps
he cannot bear to For who knows what is in the heart beneath that poor
soiled coat If you have hopes he may have memories Some day your hopes
will be memories toobirds that have flown away flowers long since
withered
III
A short way further along I come across a boy gathering palm He is a town
boy and has come all the way from Whitechapel thus early He has already
gathered a great bundleworth five shillings to him he says This same
palm will tomorrow be distributed over London and those who buy sprigs
of it by the Bank will know nothing of the blueeyed boy who gathered it
and the murmuring river by which it grew And the lad once more lost in
some squalid court will be a sort of Sir John Mandeville to his
companionsa Sir John Mandeville of the fields with their waterrats
their birds eggs and many other wonders And one can imagine him saying
And the sparrows there fly right up into the sun and sing like angels
But he wont get his comrades to believe that
IV
Spring has a wonderful way of bringing out hidden traits of character
Through my window I look out upon a tiny farm It is kept by a tall
hardlooking roughbearded fellow whom I have watched striding about his
fields all winter with but little sympathy Yet it would seem I have been
doing him wrong For this morning as he passed along the outside of the
railing wherein his two sheep were grazing suddenly they came bounding
towards him with every manifestation of delight literally recalling the
lambkins which Wordsworth saw bound as to the tabors sound They
followed as far as the railing permitted pushing their noses through at
him nay when at last he moved out of reach they were evidently so much
in love that they leaped the fence and made after him And he instead of
turning brutally on them as I had expected smiled and played with them
awhile Indeed he had some difficulty in disengaging himself from their
persistent affection So evidently they knew him better than I
A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE
Why do we go on talking It is a serious question one on which the
happiness of thousands depends For there is no more wearing social demand
than that of compulsory conversation All day long we must either talk
ordread alternativelisten Now that were very well if we had
something to say or our fellowsufferer something to tell or best of
all if either of us possessed the gift of clothing the old commonplaces
with charm But men with that great gift are not to be met with in every
railwaycarriage or at every dinner The man we actually meet is one
whose joke though we have signalled it a mile off we are powerless to
stop whose opinions come out with a whirr as of clockwork Besides it
always happens in life that the manor womanwith whom we would like to
talk is at the next table Those who really have something to say to each
other so seldom have a chance of saying it
Why oh why do we go on talking We ask the question in all seriousness
not merely in the hope of making some cheap paradoxical fun out of the
answer It is a cry from the deeps of ineffable boredom
Is it to impart information At the best it is a dreary ideal But at any
rate it is a mistaken use of the tongue for there is no information we
can impart which has not been far more accurately stated in bookform
Even if it should happen to be a quite new fact an accident happily rare
as the transit of Venusa new fact about the North Pole for
instancewell a book not a conversation is the place for it To talk
book past present or to come is not to converse
To converse as with every other art is out of three platitudes to make
not a fourth platitudebut a star Newness of information is no
necessity of conversation else were the Central News Agency the best of
talkers Indeed the oldest information is perhaps the best material for
the artist as talker though truly as with every other artist material
matters little There are just two or three men of letters left to us who
provide us examples of that inspired soliloquy those conversations of
one which are our nearest approach to the talk of other days How good it
is to listen to one of thesefor it is the great charm of their talk
that we remember nothing There were no prickly bits of information to
stick on ones mind like burrs Their talk had no regular features but
like a sunrise was all music and glory
The friend who talks the night through with his friend till the dawn
climbs in like a pallid rose at the window the lovers who while the sun
is setting sit in the greenwood and say Is it thou It is I in
awestruck antiphony till the stars appear and holiest converse of all
the mystic prattle of mother and babe why are all these such wonderful
talk if not because we remember no word of themonly the glory They
leave us nothing in image worthy of the time to pigeonhole nothing
to store with our vouchers in the pigeonholes of memory
Pigeonholes of memory Think of the degradation And memory was once a
honeycomb a hive of all the wonderful words of poets of all the
marvellous moods of lovers Once it was a shell that listened tremulously
upon Olympus and caught the accents of the Gods now it is a phonograph
catching every word that falleth from the mouths of the board of
guardians Once a muse now a servile drudge twixt man and man
And this pigeonhole memoryonce an impressionist of divine moments
now the miser of all unimportant trivial detailis our tyrant the muse
of modern talk Men talk now not what they feel or think but what they
remember with their bad good memories If they remembered the poets or
their first love or the spring or the stars it were well enough but
no they remember but what the poets ate and wore the last divorce case
the state of the crops the last trivial detail about Mars The man with
the muckrake would have made a great reputation as a talker had he lived
today for as our modern speech has it a Great Man simply means a Great
Memory and a Great Memory is simply a prosperous marinestore
What in fact do we talk about Mainly about our business our food or
our diseases All three themes more or less centre in that of food How we
revel in the brutal digestive details and call it gastronomy How our
host plumes himself on his wine as though it were a personal virtue and
not the merely obvious accessory of a man with ten thousand a year
Strange is it not how we pat and stroke our possessions as though they
belonged to us instead of to our moneyour grandfathers money
There is some hope and believe an imminent Return to
SimplicitySocialism the unwise it call If it be really true what good
news for the grave humorous man who hates talking to anything but trees
and children For if that Return to Simplicity means anything it must
mean the sweeping away of immemorial rookeries of talksuch crannied
hives of gossip as the professions with all their garrulous heritage of
trivial witty ana literary dramatic legal aristocratic
ecclesiastical commercial How good to dip them all deep in the great
ocean of oblivion and watch the bookworms diarists raconteurs and
all the oldclothesmen of life scurrying out of their holes as when in
summertime Mary Anne submerges the cockroach trap within the pail And
oh let there be no Noah to that flood Let none survive to tell another
tale for only when the chronicler of smallbeer is dead shall we be able
to know men as men heroes as heroes poets as poetsinstead of mere
centres of gossip an inch of text to a yard of footnote Then only may we
begin to talk of something worth the talking not merely of how the great
man creased his trousers and call it the study of character but of how
he was great and whether it is possible to climb after him
Talk too is so definite so limited The people we meet might seem so
wonderful might mean such quaint and charming meanings sometimes if they
would not talk Like some delightfully bound old volume in a foreign
tongue that looks like one of the Sibylline books till a friend
translates the title and explains that it is a sixteenthcentury law
dictionary so are the men and women we meet How interesting they might
be if they would not persist in telling us what they are about
That indeed is the abiding charm of Nature No sensible man can envy
Asylas to whom the language of birds was as familiar as French argot to
our young decadents Think how terrible it would be if Nature could all
of a sudden learn English That exquisite mirror of all our shifting moods
would be broken for ever No longer might we coin the woodland into
metaphors of our own joys and sorrows The birds would no longer flute to
us of lost loves but of found worms we should realise how terribly
selfish they are we could never more quote Hark hark the lark at
heavens gate sings or poetise with Mr Patmore of the heavenlyminded
thrush And what awful voices some of those great red roses would have
Yes Nature is so sympathetic because she is so silent because when she
does talk she talks in a language which we cannot understand but only
guess at and her silence allows us to hear her eternal meanings which
her gossiping would drown
Happy monks of La Trappe One has heard the foolish chattering world take
pity upon you An hour of talk to a year of silence O heavenly
proportion And I can well imagine that when that hour has come it seems
but a trivial toy you have forgotten how to play with Were I a Trappist
I would use my hour to evangelise converts to silence would break the
long years quiet but to whisper How good is silence Let us inaugurate
a secular La Trappe let us plot a conspiracy of silence let us send the
world to Coventry Or if we must talk let it be in Latin or in the
Volapuk of myriadmeaning music and let no man joke save in Greekthat
all may laugh But best of all let us leave off talking altogether and
listen to the morning stars
LIFE IN INVERTED COMMAS
As I waited for an omnibus at the corner of Fleet Street the other day I
was the spectator of a curious occurrence Suddenly there was a scuffle
hard by me and turning round I saw a powerful gentlemanly man wrestling
with two others in livery who were evidently intent on arresting him
These men I at once perceived belonged to the detective force of the
Incorporated Society of Authors and were engaged in the capture of a
notorious plagiarist I knew the prisoner well He had in fact pillaged
from my own writings but I was none the less sorry for his plight to
which I would assure the reader I was no party Yet he was I admit an
egregiously bad case and my pity is doubtless misplaced sentiment Like
many another he had begun his career as a quotation and ended as a
plagiarism daring even in one instance to imitate that shadow in the
fairytale which rose up on a sudden one day and declared himself to be
the substance and the substance his shadow Indeed he had so far
succeeded as to make many people question whether or not he was the
original and the other man the plagiarism However there was no longer to
be any doubt of it for his captors had him fast this time and
presently we saw him taken off in a hansom well secured between strong
inverted commas
This curious circumstance set me reflecting and as we trundled along
towards Charing Cross my mind gave birth to sundry sententious
reflections
After all I thought that unlucky plagiarist is no worse than most of us
for is it not true that few of us live as conscientiously as we should
within our inverted commas We are far more inclined to live in that
author not ourselves who makes for originality It is of course
difficult even with the best intentions to make proper acknowledgment of
all our authoritiesto attach so to say the true del et sculp
to all our little bits of art There is so much in our lives that we
honestly dont know how we came by
As I reflected in this wise I was drawn to notice my companions in the
omnibus and lo there was not an original person amongst us Yet I looked
in vain to see if they wore their inverted commas Not one of them
believe me had had the honesty to bring them Each looked at me
unblushingly as though he were really original and not a cheap German
print of originals I had seen in books and pictures since I could read I
really think that they must have been unaware of their imposture They
could hardly have pretended so successfully
There was the young dandy just let loose from his bandbox wearing
exactly the same face the same smile the same necktie holding his
stick in exactly the same fashion talking exactly the same words with
precisely the same accent as his neighbour another dandy and as all the
other dandies between the Bank and Hyde Park Corner Yet he seemed
persuaded of his own originality He evidently felt that there was
something individual about him and apparently relied with confidence on
his friend not addressing a third dandy by mistake for him I hope he had
his name safe in his hat
Looking at these three examples of Natures love of repeating herself I
said to myself Somewhere in heaven stands a great stencil and at each
sweep of the cosmic brush a million dandies are born each one alike as a
box of collars Indeed I felt that this stencil process had been employed
in the manufacture of every single person in that omnibus two middleaged
matrons each of whom seemed to think that having given birth to six
children was an indisputable claim to originality two elderly business
men to correspond a young miss carrying music and wearing eyeglasses
and a clergyman discussing stocks with one of the business men I alone in
my corner being of course the one occupant for whom Nature had been at
the expense of casting a special mould and at the extravagance of
breaking it
Presently a matron and a business man alighted and two dainty young
women evidently of artistic tendencies joined the Hammersmith pilgrims
One saw at a glance that they were very sure of their originality There
were no inverted commas around their pretty young heads bless them But
then Queen Anne houses are as much on a pattern as more commonplace
structures and Bedford Parkians are already being manufactured by
celestial stencil What I specially noticed about them was their
plagiarised voicescurious yearning things evidently intended to
suggest depths of infinite passion controlled by many a wild and weary
past
Infinite passion and the pain
Of finite souls that yearn
the kind of voice you know in which Socialist actresses yearn out
passages from The Cenci feeling that they do a fearful thing The voice
began I believe with Miss Ellen Terry With her though it is charming
for it is we feel the voice of real emotion There are real tears in it
It is her own But with these ladies who were discussing the last
Independent play it was so evidently a stop pulled out by
affectationthe vox inhumana one might say for it is a voice unlike
anything else to be found in the four elements It has its counterpart in
the imitators of Mr Beerbohm Treeyoung actors who likewise endeavour to
make up for the lack of anything like dramatic passion by pretending to
control it the control being feigned by a set jaw or a hard throaty
uncadenced voice of preternatural solemnity These ladies too wore
plagiarised gowns of the most original style plagiarised hats
glittering plagiarised smiles and yet they so evidently looked down on
every one else in the omnibus whom perhaps after all it had been
kinder of me to describe as the hackneyed quotations of humanity who had
probably thought it unnecessary to wear their inverted commas as they
were so well known
At last I grew impatient of them and leaving the omnibus finished my
journey home by the Underground What was my surprise when I reached it to
find our little house wearing inverted commastwo on the chimney and two
on the gate My wife too and the words of endearing salutation with
which I greeted her why they also to my diseased fancy seemed to leave
my lips between quotation marks There is nothing in which we fancy
ourselves so original as in our terms of endearment nothing in which we
are so like all the world for alas there is no euphuism of affection
which lovers have not prattled together in springtides long before the
Christian era If you call your wife a chuck so did Othello and
whatever dainty diminutive you may hit on Catullus with his warbling
Latin makes mouths at our speech
I grew so haunted with this oppressive thought that my wife could not but
notice my trouble But how could I tell her of the spectral inverted
commas that dodged every move of her dear headtell her that our own
original firstborn just beginning to talk as never baby talked was an
unblushing plagiarism of his greatgreatgreatgrandfather that our love
was nothing but the expansion of a line of Keats and that our whole life
was one hideous mockery of originality Woman I felt inclined to
shriek be yourself and not your greatgrandmother A man may not marry
his greatgrandmother For Gods sake let us all be ourselves and not
ghastly mimicries of our ancestors or our neighbours Let us shake
ourselves free from this evil dream of imitation Merciful Heaven it is
killing me But surely that was a quotation too and accidentally
catching sight of the back of my hand suddenly the tears sprang to my
eyes for it was just so the big soft veins used to be on the hands of my
father when a little boy I prayed between his knees He was gone but
here was his handhis hand not mine
Then an idea possessed me There was but one way I could die There was a
little phial of laudanum in the medicinecupboard that always leered at me
from among the other bottles like a serpents eye Thrice happy thought
Who would miss such a poor imitation Even the mere soapvending tradesmen
bid us beware of imitations Dark wine of forgetfulness No that was
a quotation However here was the phial I drew the cork inhaled for a
moment the hard dry odour of poppies and prepared to drink But just at
that moment I seemed to hear a horrid little laugh coming out of the
bottle and a voice chuckled at my ear You ass do you call that
original It was so absurd that I burst out into hysterical laughter
Here had I been about to do the most banal thing of all Was there
anything in the world quite so commonplace as suicide
And with the good spirits of laughter came peace Nay why worry to be
original Why such haste to be unlike the rest of the world when the
best things of life were manifestly those which all men had in common Was
love less sweet because my nextdoor neighbour knew it as well Would the
same reason make death less bitter And were not those tender diminutives
all the more precious because their vowels had been rounded for us by the
sweet lips of lovers dead and gonesainted jewels still warm from the
beat of tragic bosoms flowers which their kisses had freighted with
immortal meanings
And then I bethought me how the meadowdaisies were one as the other and
how when the pearly shells of the dog rose settled on the hedge like a
flight of butterflies one was as the other how the birds sang alike how
star was twin with star and in peas is no distinction My rhetoric
stopped as I was about to say as wife is to wifefor I thought I would
first kiss her and see and lo I was once more perplexed for as I looked
down into her eyes simple and blue and deep as the sky is simple and
blue and deep I declared her to be the only woman in the worldwhich was
obviously not exact But it was true for all that
FRACTIONAL HUMANITY
Mankind in its heavy fashion has chosen to mock the tailor with the
factthe indubitable factthat he is but the ninth part of a man Yet
after all at this time of day it seems more of a compliment than a gibe
To be a whole ninth of a man Few of us when we ponder it can boast so
much Take for instance that other proverbial case of the
fractionalpartofapinmaker It takes nine persons to make a pin we
were taught in our catechism Actually that means that it takes nine
persons to make one whole pinmaker which leaves the question still to be
solved as to how many whole pinmakers it takes to make a man What is the
relation of one pinmaker to the whole social economy That discovered a
multiplication by nine will give us the exact fractional part of manhood
which belongs to the ninthofapinmaker Obviously he is a much more
microscopic creature than the immemorially despised tailor and alas his
case is nearest that of most of us And it is curious to notice how we
rejoice in rather than lament this inevitable result of that great law
of differentiation which one may figure as a terrible machine hour after
hour chopping up mankind into more and more infinitesimal fragments We
feel a pride in being spoken of as specialistsand yet what is a
specialist The ninehundredandninetyninth part of a man Call me not
an entomologist call me a lepidopterist if you willthough really
that is too broad a term for a man who is not so much taken up with moths
generally as with the third ring of the antenn of the great oakeggar
If one is troubled with a gift for symbolism it is hard to treat any man
one meets as though he were really a whole man to treat a lawyer as
though he were anything but a deed of assignment or a surgeon as if he
were anything more than an operation As the metropolitan trains load and
unload in a morning what does one see Gross upon gross of steel pens a
few quills whole carriages full of bricklayers trowels and how strange
it seems to watch all the bankbooks sorting themselves out from the
motley and arranging themselves in the first classes just as we see them
on the shelf in the bank It is a curious sight The little shopgirl
there what is she but a roll of pink ribbonnay she is but
halfayard And the poor infinitesimal porters and guards how
pathetically small seems their share in the great monosyllable Man
animalcules in that great social system which again is but an animalcule
in the blood of Time Still more infinitesimal seems the man who is a
subdivision not of a form of work even but merely of a form of taste
the man who collects foreign stamps say or bookplates or arrowheads
the connoisseur of a tiny section of one of the lesser schools of Italian
painting the coralinsect who has devoted his life to a participle
firstedition men and all those various bookworms who without
impropriety be it spoken are the maggots that breed in the dung of the
great A certain friend of mine always appears to me in the similitude of
a first edition of one of Mr Hardys novels I have the greatest
difficulty at times to prevent myself forcibly setting him upon my shelf
to complete my set for oddly enough he is the one bit of Hardyana I
lack In which confession I let the reader into the secret of my own petty
limitations To have ones horizon bounded by a bookplate to have no
hope no wish in life beyond a first edition The workers however
sectional have some place in the text of the great book of life but such
mere testers and tasters of existence have hardly a place even in the
gloss though it be printed in the most microscopic diamond
And every moment as we said we are being turned out smaller and smaller
from the mill of Time You ask your little boy what he would like to be
when he grows up To your consternation he answers A man You hide your
face you cannot tell him how impossible it is now to be that Poor little
chap He is born centuries too late You cannot promise even that he shall
be a tailor for by the time he is old enough to be apprenticed how do
you know how that ancient profession may be divided up May you not have
sadly to tell him My poor boy it is impossible to make you thatfor
there are no longer any wholetailors You may if you like be a
threadwaxer or a needlethreader you may be one of the thirty men it
takes to make a buttonhole but a complete tailoralas it is
impossible
Who will save us from this remorseless law of eternal subdivision To make
one complete man out of all this vast collection of snips and snippets of
humanity To piece all the trades professions and fads together like a
puzzle till one saw the honest face of a genuine man round and whole once
more To take these dry bones of the Valley of Commerce and powerfully
breathe into them the unifying breath of life that once more they stand
up not as fractional bones of the wrist or the ankle of manhood but
mighty fullblooded men as of old Ah we must wait for a new creation
for that
The mystics have a suggestive fancy that all our vast complex life once
existed as a peaceful unit in the mind of God But as God brooding in
the abyss meditated upon Himself various thoughts separated themselves
and revolved within the atmosphere of His mind at first unconscious of
themselves or each other Presently desire of separate existence awoke in
these shadowy things a lust of corporeality grew upon them and hence at
last the fall into physical life the realisation in concrete form of
their diaphanous individualities And that original cause of mans
separation from deity this desire of subdivision how it has gone on
operating more and more We call it differentiation but the mystic would
describe it as dividing ourselves more and more from God the primeval
unity in which alone is blessedness Blake in one of his prophetic books
sings mans fall into Division and his resurrection into Unity And when
we look about us and consider but the common use of words how do we find
the mystics apparently wild fancy illustrated in every section of our
commonplace lives What do we mean when we speak of division of
