but more particularly to Grellman and Hoyland who in addition to the
facts which came under their own immediate notice have published the
observations of travellers and others interested in the history of this
people  A list of these authors may be seen in the Appendix
But his knowledge of this people does not entirely depend on the
testimony of others having had the opportunity of closely examining for
himself their habits and character in familiar visits to their tents and
by allowing his door to be free of access to all those encamped near
Southampton when they have needed his help and advice  Thus has he
gained a general knowledge of their vicious habits their comparative
virtues and their unhappy modes of life which he hopes the following
pages will fully prove and be the means of placing their character in
the light of truth and of correcting various mistakes respecting them
which have given rise to many unjust and injurious prejudices against
them
The Author could have enlarged the present work very considerably had he
detailed all the facts with which he is well acquainted
His object however was to furnish a work which should be concise and
cheap that he might be the means of exciting among his countrymen an
energetic benevolence toward this despised people for it cannot be
denied that many thousands of them have never given the condition of the
Gipsies a single thought
Such a work is now presented to the public  Whether the author has
succeeded will be best known to those persons who have the most correct
and extensive information relative to the unhappy race in question
Should he be the honoured instrument of exciting in any breasts the same
feelings of pity mercy love and zeal for these poor English heathens
as is felt and carried into useful plans for the heathens abroad by
christians of all denominations he will then be certain that by the
blessing of the Redeemer the confidence of the Gipsies will be gained
and that they will be led to that Saviour who has said Whosoever
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast him out
CHAP I  On the Origin of the Gipsies
Of the Origin of these wanderers of the human race the learned are not
agreed for we have no authentic records of their first emigrations
Some suppose them to be the descendants of Israel and many others that
they are of Egyptian origin  But the evidence adduced in confirmation of
these opinions appears very inconclusive  We cannot discover more than
fifty Hebrew words in the language they speak and they have not a
ceremony peculiar to the Hebrew nation  They have not a word of Coptic
and but few of Persian derivation  And they are deemed as strangers in
Egypt at the present time  They are now found in many countries of
Europe Asia and Africa in all of which they speak a language peculiar
to themselves  On the continent of America alone are there none of them
found  Grellman informs us that there were great numbers in Lorraine
and that they dwelt in its forests before the French Revolution of 1790
He supposes that there are no less than 700000 in the world and that
the greatest numbers are found in Europe  Throughout the countries they
inhabit they have kept themselves a distinct race of people in every
possible way
They never visit the Norman Isles and it is said by the natives of
Ireland that their numbers are small in that country  Hoyland informs
us that many counties in Scotland are free of them while they wander
about in other districts of that country as in England  He has also
informed us sec 6 of a colony which resides during the winter months
at Kirk Yetholm in the county of Roxburgh 10
Sir Thomas Brown in his work entitled VULGAR ERRORS says that they
were seen first in Germany in the year 1409  In 1418 they were found
in Switzerland and in 1422 in Italy  They appeared in France on the
17th August 1427  It is remarkable that when they first came into
Europe they were black and that the women were still blacker than the
men  From Grellman we learn that in Hungary there are 50000 in
Spain 60000 and that they are innumerable in Constantinople
It appears from the statute of the 22nd of Henry VIII made against this
people that they must at that time have been in England some years and
must have increased much in number and in crime  In the 27th of that
reign a law was made against the importation of such persons subjecting
the importer to 40l penalty  In that reign also they were considered
so dangerous to the morals and comfort of the country that many of them
were sent back to Calais  Yet in the reign of Elizabeth they were
estimated at 10000 11a
Dr Walsh says that the Gipsies in Turkey like the Jews are
distinguishable by indelible personal marks dark eyes brown complexion
and black hair and by unalterable moral qualities an aversion to
labour and a propensity to petty thefts 11b
The celebrated traveller Dr Daniel Clarke speaks of great numbers of
Gipsies in Persia who are much encouraged by the Tartars  Formerly and
particularly on the Continent they had their counts lords and dukes
but these were titles without either power or riches
The English Gipsies were formerly accustomed to denominate an aged man
and woman among them as their king and queen but this is a political
distinction which has not been recognized by them for many years
If we suppose the Gipsies to have been heathens before they came into
this country their separation from pagan degradation and cruelty has
been attended with many advantages to themselves  They have seen neither
the superstitions of idolatry nor the unnatural cruelties of heathenism
They are not destitute of those sympathies and attachments which would
adorn the most polished circles  In demonstration of this we have only
to make ourselves acquainted with the fervour and tenderness of their
conjugal parental and filial sensibilitiesand the great care they
take of all who are aged infirm and blind among them  Were these
highly interesting qualities sanctified by pure religion they would
exhibit much of the beauty and loveliness of the christian character  I
am aware that an opinion is general that they are cruel to their
children but it may be questioned if ebullitions of passion are more
frequent among them in reference to their children than among other
classes of society and when these ebullitions which are not lasting
are overtheir conduct toward their children is most affectionate  The
attachment of Gipsy children to their parents is equally vivid and
admirable it grows with their years and strengthens even as their
connections increase 12  And indeed the affection that sisters and
brothers have one for the other is very great  A short time since the
little sister of a Gipsy youth seventeen years of age was taken ill with
a fever when his mind became exceedingly distressed and he gave way to
excessive grief and weeping
Those who suppose these wanderers of mankind to be of Hindostanee or
Suder origin have much the best proof on their side  A real Gipsy has a
countenance eye mouth hands ancle and quickness of manners strongly
indicative of Hindoo origin  This is more particularly the case with the
females  Nor is the above mere assertion  The testimony of the most
intelligent travellers many of whom have long resided in India fully
supports this opinion  And indeed persons who have not travelled on
the Asiatic Continent but who have seen natives of Hindostan have been
surprised at the similarity of manners and features existing between them
and the Gipsies  The Author of this work once met with a Hindoo woman
and was astonished at the great resemblance she bore in countenance and
manners to the female Gipsy of his own country
The Hindoo Suder delights in horses tinkering music and fortune
telling so does the Gipsy  The Suder tribes of the same part of the
Asiatic Continent are wanderers dwelling chiefly in wretched mudhuts
When they remove from one place to another they carry with them their
scanty property  The English Gipsies imitate these erratic tribes in
this particular  They wander from place to place and carry their small
tents with them which consist of a few bent sticks and a blanket 14
The Suders in the East eat the flesh of nearly every unclean creature
nor are they careful that the flesh of such creatures should not be
putrid  How exactly do the Gipsies imitate them in this abhorrent choice
of food  They have been in the habit of eating many kinds of brutes not
even excepting dogs and cats and when pressed by hunger have sought
after the most putrid carrion  It has been a common saying among
themthat which God kills is better than that killed by man  But
of late years with a few exceptions they have much improved in this
respect for they now eat neither dogs nor cats and but seldom seek
after carrion  But in winter they will dress and eat snails hedgehogs
and other creatures not generally dressed for food
But the strongest evidence of their Hindoo origin is the great
resemblance their own language bears to the Hindostanee  The following
Vocabulary is taken from Grellman Hoyland and Captain Richardson  The
first of these respectable authors declares that twelve out of thirty
words of the Gipsies language are either purely Hindostanee or nearly
related to it
The following list of words are among those which bear the greatest
resemblance to that language

This language called by themselves Slang or Gibberish invented as
they think by their forefathers for secret purposes is not merely the
language of one or a few of these wandering tribes which are found
in the European Nations but is adopted by the vast numbers who inhabit
the earth
One of our reformed Gipsies while in the army was with his regiment at
Portsmouth and being on garrison duty with an invalid soldier he was
surprised to hear some words of the Gipsy language unintentionally
uttered by him who was a German  On enquiring how he understood this
language the German replied that he was of Gipsy origin and that it
was spoken by this race in every part of his native land for purposes of
secrecy 16
A well known nobleman who had resided many years in India taking
shelter under a tree during a storm in this country near a camp of
Gipsies was astonished to hear them use several words he well knew were
Hindostanee and going up to them he found them able to converse with
him in that language
Not long ago a Missionary from India who was well acquainted with the
language of Hindostan was at the Authors house when a Gipsy was
present and after a conversation which he had with her he declared
that her people must once have known the Hindostanee language well
Indeed Gipsies have often expressed surprise when words have been read to
them out of the Hindostanee vocabulary
Lord Teignmouth once said to a young Gipsy woman in Hindostanee Tue
burra tschur that is Thou a great thief  She immediately replied
NoI am not a thiefI live by fortune telling
It can be no matter of surprise that this language as spoken among this
people is generally corrupted when we consider that for many
centuries they have known nothing of elementary science and have been
strangers to books and letters  Perhaps the secrecy necessary to effect
many of their designs has been the greatest means of preserving its
scanty remains among them  But an attempt to prove that they are not
of Hindoo origin because they do not speak the Hindostanee with perfect
correctness would be as absurd as to declare that our Gipsies are not
natives of England because they speak very incorrect English  The few
words that follow and which occurred in some conversations the Author
had with the most intelligent of the Gipsies he has met prove how
incorrectly they speak our language and yet it would be worse than
folly to attempt to prove that they are not natives of England

Brand in his observations on POPULAR ANTIQUITIES is of opinion that the
first Gipsies fled from Asia when the cruel Timur Beg ravaged India
with a view to proselyte the heathen to the Mohammedan religion at which
time about 500000 human beings were butchered by him  Some suppose
that soon after this time many who escaped the sword of this human
fury came into Europe through Egypt and on this account were called in
English GIPSIES
Although there is not the least reason whatever to suppose the Gipsies to
have had an Egyptian origin and although as we have asserted in a
former page they are strangers in that land of wonders to the present
day yet it appears possible to me that Egypt may have had something to
do with their present appellation  And allowing that the supposition is
well founded which ascribes to them a passage through Egypt into
European nations it is very likely they found their way to that place
under the following circumstances
In the years 1408 and 1409 Timur Beg ravaged India to make as has
already been observed proselytes to the Mohammedan delusion when he put
hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants to the sword  It is very
rational to suppose that numbers of those who had the happiness not to
be overtaken by an army so dreadful on account of the cruelties it
perpetrated should save their lives by flying from their native land to
become wandering strangers in another  Now if we assert that the Gipsies
were of the Suder cast of Asiatic Indians and that they found their way
from Hindostan into other and remote countries when Timur Beg spread
around him terrors so dreadful it is natural to ask why did not some of
the other casts of India accompany them  This objection has no weight at
all when we consider the hatred and contempt poured upon the Suder by all
the other casts of India  The Bramins Tschechteries and Beis were as
safe though menaced with destruction by Timur Beg as they would have
been along with the Suder tribes seeking a retreat from their enemy in
lands where he would not be likely to follow them  Besides the other
casts from time immemorial have looked on their country as especially
given them of God and they would as soon have suffered death as leave
it  The Suders had not these prepossessions for their native soil  They
were a degraded peoplea people looked on as the lowest of the human
race and with an army seeking their destruction they had every motive
to leave and none to stay in Hindostan
It cannot be determined by what track the forefathers of the Gipsies
found their way from Hindostan to the countries of Europe  But it may be
presumed that they passed over the southern Persian deserts of Sigiston
Makran and Kirman along the Persian Gulph to the mouth of the Euphrates
thence to Bassora into the deserts of Arabia and thence into Egypt by
the Isthmus of Suez
It is a fact not unworthy a place in these remarks on the origin of this
people that they do not like to be called Gipsies unless by those
persons whom they have reason to consider their real friends  This
probably arises from two causes of great distress to themGipsies are
suspected and hated as the perpetrators of all crimeand they are
almost universally prosecuted as vagrants  Is it to be wondered at
that to strangers they do not like to acknowledge themselves as Gipsies
I think not
We will conclude our remarks on the origin of these erratic sons of Adam
by adding the testimony of Col Herriot read before the Royal Asiatic
Society Sir George Staunton in the chair  That gentleman giving an
account of the Zingaree of India says that this class of people are
frequently met with in that part of Hindostan which is watered by the
Ganges as well as the Malwa Guzerat and the Decan they are called
Nath or Benia the first term signifying a rogueand the second a
dancer or tumbler  And the same gentleman cites various authorities
in demonstration of the resemblance between these Gipsies and their
neglected brethren in Europe  Nor does he think that the English Gipsies
are so degraded as is generally supposed in support of which he mentions
some instances of good feeling displayed by them under his own
observation while in Hampshire
CHAP II  Observations on the Character Manners and Habits of the
English Gipsies
The origin of this people is by no means of so much importance as the
knowledge of their present character manners and habits with the view
to the devising of proper plans for the improvement of their condition
and their conversion to christianity for to any one who desires to love
his neigbour as himself their origin will be but a secondary
consideration
Fifty years ago the Gipsies had their regular journeys and often
remained one or two months in a place when they worked at their trades
And as access to different towns was more difficult than at the present
day partly from the badness of the roads and partly from the paucity of
carriers they were considered by the peasantry and by small farmers of
whom there were great numbers in those days as very useful branches of
the human family I mean the industrious and better part of them  At
that period they usually encamped in the farmers fields or slept in
their barns and not being subject to the driving system as they now
are they seldom robbed hedges for their fires were replenished with
deadwood procured without any risk of fines or imprisonments from
decayed trees and wooded banks  And it is proper to suppose that at
such a time their outrages and depredations were very few
It has already been stated that the Gipsies are very numerous amounting
to about 700000  It is supposed that there are about 18000 in this
kingdom  But be they less or more we ought never to forgetthat they
are branches of the same family with ourselvesthat they are capable of
being fitted for all the duties and enjoyments of lifeand what is
better than all that they are redeemed by the same Saviour may partake
of the same salvation and be prepared for the same state of immortal
bliss from whence flows to the universal church of Christ that peace
which the world cannot take from her  Their condition therefore at
once commands our sympathies energies prayers and benevolence
Gipsies in general are of a tawny or brown colour but this is not wholly
hereditary  The chief cause is probably the lowness of their habits for
they very seldom wash their persons or the clothes they wear their
linen excepted  Their alternate exposures to cold and heat and the
smoke surrounding their small camps perpetually tend to increase those
characteristics of complexion and feature by which they are at present
distinguishable
It is not often that a Gipsy is seen welldressed even when they possess
costly apparel but their women are fond of finery  They are much
delighted with broad lace large eardrops a variety of rings and
glaring colours and when they possess the means shew how great a share
they have of that foolish vanity which is said to be inherent in
females and which leads many destitute of the faith and hope and
love and humility of the gospel into utter ruin
A remarkable instance of the love of costly attire in a female Gipsy is
well known to the writer  The woman alluded to obtained a very large
sum of money from three maiden ladies pledging that it should be
doubled by her art in conjuration  She then decamped to another
district where she bought a bloodhorse a black beaver hat a new
sidesaddle and bridle a silvermounted whip and figured away in her
illobtained finery at the fairs  It is not easy to imagine the
disappointment and resentment of the covetous and credulous ladies whom
she had so easily duped
Nor indeed are the males of this people less addicted to the love of gay
clothing if it suited their interests to exhibit it  An orphan only
ten years of age taken from actual starvation last winter and who was
fed and clothed and had every care taken of him would not remain with
those who wished him well and who had been his friends but returned to
the camp from which he had been taken saying that he would be a
Gipsy and would wear silver buttons on his coat and have topped
boots and when asked how he would get them he repliedby catching
rats
Some Gipsies try to excel others in the possession of silver buttons
They will sometimes give as much as fifteen pounds for a set  The
females too spend many pounds on weighty gold rings for their fingers
The Author has by him belonging to a Gipsy three massy rings soldered
together and with a half sovereign on the top which serves instead of a
brilliant stone  We pity a vain Gipsy whose eyes are taken and whose
heart delights in such vulgar pomp  Are not those equally pitiable who
estimate themselves only by the gaiety singularity or costliness of
their apparel  The Saviour has given us a rule by which we may judge
persons in reference to their dress as well as in other ostensibilities
of characterby their fruits ye shall know them
The Gipsies are not strangers to pawnbrokers shops but they do not
visit these places for the same purposes as the vitiated poor of our
trading towns  A pawnshop is their bank  When they acquire property
illegally as by stealing swindling or fortunetelling they purchase
valuable plate and sometimes in the same hour pledge it for safety
Such property they have in store against days of adversity and trouble
which on account of their dishonest habits often overtake them  Should
one of their families stand before a Judge of his country charged with a
crime which is likely to cost him his life or to transport him every
article of value is sacrificed to save him from death or apprehended
banishment  In such cases they generally retain a Counsellor to plead
for the brother in adversity
At other times they carry their plate about with them and when visited
by friends they bring out from dirty bags a silver teapot and a
creamjug and spoons of the same metal  Their plate is by no means
paltry  Of course considerable property in plate is not very generally
possessed by them
The Gipsies of this country are very punctual in paying their debts  All
the Shopkeepers with whom they deal in these parts have declared that
they are some of their best and most honest customers  For the payment
of a debt which is owing to one of their own people the time and place
are appointed by them and should the debtor disappoint the creditor he
is liable by their law of honour to pay double the amount he owes and he
must pay it by personal servitude if he cannot with money if he wish to
be considered by his friends honest and respectable  They call this law
pizharris
There are few of these unhappy people that can either read or write  Yet
a regular and frequent correspondence is kept up between the members of
families who have had the least advantage of the sort and those who have
had no advantages whatever correspond through the kindness of friends
who write for them  Numerous are the letters which they receive from
their relatives in New South Wales to which Colony so many hundreds of
this unsettled race have been transported  Their letters are usually
left at one particular postoffice in the districts where they travel
and should such letters not be called for during a long period they are
usually kept by the postmaster who is sure they will be claimed sooner
or later  A long journey will be no impediment when a letter is
expected for a Gipsy will travel any distance to obtain an expected
favour of the kind  They are never heard to complain of the heavy
expense of postage
We have already observed that there are many genuine features of humanity
in the character of this degraded and despised people  Their constantly
retaining an affectionate remembrance of their deceased relatives
affords a striking proof of this statement  And their attachment to the
horse donkey rings snuffbox silverspoons and all things except the
clothes of the deceased relatives is very strong  With such articles
they will never part except in the greatest distress and then they only
pledge some of them which are redeemed as soon as they possess the
means
Most families visit the graves of their near relatives once in the year
generally about the time of Christmas  Then the depository of the dead
becomes a rallying spot for the living for there they renew their
attachments and sympathies and give and receive assurances of continued
good will  At such periods however they are too often addicted to
feasting and intemperance
The graves of the deceased of this people are usually kept in very good
order in the various Church yards where they lie interred  This is done
by the Sextons for which they are annually remunerated  Sometimes large
sums of money are expended on the erection of headstones and in one
instance a monument was erected in the County of Wilts at considerable
cost  It is not very long since that the parents of a deceased Gipsy
child whom they loved very much paid a great sum to have it buried in
the Church
The Gipsies have a singular custom of burning all the clothes belonging
to any one among them deceased with the straw litter c of his tent
Whether this be from fear of infection or from superstition the Author
has not been able to learn  Perhaps both unite in the continuation of a
custom which must be attended with some loss to them 28
Seldom do these mysterious sons and daughters of Adam unite themselves in
the holy obligations of marriage after the form of the Established
Church of our land  Nor indeed for so sacred a union have they any
ceremony at all  The parents on each side are consulted on such
occasions and if their consent be obtained the parties become after
their custom husband and wife  Should the parents object like the
thoughtless and imprudent persons in higher life who flee to Gretna
Green the Gipsy lovers also escape from their parents to another
district  When the couple are again met by the friends of the female
they take her from her protector but if it appear that he has treated
her kindly and is likely to continue to do so they restore her to him
and all objections and animosities are forgotten
As it seldom happens that they now stay more than a few days in one
place the Gipsy his wife and each of their children may severally
belong to different parishes  This is an objection to their ultimate
settlement in any one place  It will be some time before this objection
can be removed not till the present generation of Gipsies has passed
away and their posterity cease to make the wilderness their homes
choosing a parish for a permanent place of settlement
It may naturally be expected that these inhabitants of the field and
forest the lane and the moor are not without a knowledge of the
medicinal qualities of certain herbs  In all slight disorders they have
recourse to these remedies and frequently use the inner bark of the elm
starintheearth parsley pellitoryinthewall and wormwood  They
are not subject to the numerous disorders and fevers common in large
towns but in some instances they are visited with that dreadful scourge
of the British nation the Typhus fever which spreads through their
little camp and becomes fatal to some of its families  The smallpox
and measles are disorders they very much dread but they are not more
disposed to rheumatic affections than those who live in houses  It is a
fact however that ought not to be passed over here that when they
leave their tents to settle in towns they are generally ill for a time
The children of one family that wintered with us in 1831 were nearly all
attacked with fever that threatened their lives  This may be occasioned
by their taking all at once to regular habits and the renunciation of
that exercise to which they have been so long accustomed with some
disposing qualities in their change of diet and the atmosphere of a
thickly populated town
This people often live to a considerable age many instances of which are
well known  In his tent at Launton Oxfordshire died in the year 1830
more than a hundred years of age James Smith called by some the King
of the Gipsies  By his tribe he was looked up to with the greatest
respect and veneration  His remains were followed to the grave by his
widow who is herself more than a hundred years old and by many of his
children grandchildren great grandchildren and other relatives and
by several individuals of other tribes  At the funeral his widow tore
her hair uttered the most frantic exclamations and begged to be allowed
to throw herself on the coffin that she might be buried with her
husband  The religion of the Redeemer would have taught her to say The
Lord gave and the Lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the
Lord
A woman of the name of B lived to the reputed age of a hundred and
twenty years and up to that age was accustomed to sing her song very
gaily  Many events in the life of this woman were very remarkable  In
her youth she was a noted swindler  At one time she got a large sum of
money and other valuable effects from a lady for which and other
offences she was condemned to die  A petition was presented to George
the Third to use the Gipsys own expression who told the author just
after he had set up business that is begun to reign and he attended
to its prayer  The sentence was reversed and her life was consequently
spared  But poor woman she repented not of her sins for she taught
