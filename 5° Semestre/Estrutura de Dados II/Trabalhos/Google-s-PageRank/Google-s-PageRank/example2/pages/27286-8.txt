list of common engine troubles and their remedies I have thought it
better to endeavour to explain thoroughly the fundamental principles and
essentials of good running so that should any difficulty arise the
engine attendant will be able to reason out for himself the cause of the
trouble and will thus know the proper remedy to apply This will give
him a command over his engine which should render him equal to any
emergency

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTORY
The history of the gas engine goes back a long way and the history of
the internal combustion engine proper further still It will be
interesting to recount the main points in the history of the development
of the class of engine we shall deal with in the following pages in
order to show what huge strides were made soon after the correct and
most workable theory had been formulated
In 1678 Abbe Hautefeuille explained how a machine could be constructed
to work with gunpowder as fuel His arrangement was to explode the
gunpowder in a closed vessel provided with valves and cool the products
of combustion and so cause a partial vacuum to be formed By the aid of
such a machine water could be raised This inventor however does not
seem to have carried out any experiments
In 1685 Huyghens designed another powder machine and Papin in 1688
described a similar machine which was provided with regular valves as
devised by himself in the Proceedings of the Leipsic Academy 1688
From this time until 1791 when John Barber took out a patent for the
production of force by the combustion of hydrocarbon in air practically
no advancement was made The latter patent curiously enough comprised
a very primitive form of rotary engine Barber proposed to turn coal
oil or other combustible stuff into gas by means of external firing
and then to mix the gases so produced with air in a vessel called the
exploder This mixture was then ignited as it issued from the vessel
and the ensuing flash caused a paddlewheel to rotate Mention is also
made that it was an object to inject a little water into the exploder
in order to strengthen the force of the flash
Robert Streets patent of 1794 mentions a piston engine in the cylinder
of which coal tar spirit or turpentine was vaporised the gases being
ignited by a light burning outside the cylinder The piston in this
engine was thrown upwards this in turn forcing a pump piston down which
did work in raising water This was the first real gas engine though it
was crude and very imperfectly arranged
In 1801 Franzose Lebon described a machine to be driven by means of
coalgas Two pumps were used to compress air and gas and the mixture
was fired as recommended by the inventor by an electric spark and
drove a piston in a doubleworking cylinder
The atmospheric engine of Samuel Brown 1823 had a piston working in a
cylinder into which gas was introduced and the latter being ignited
expanded the air in cylinder whilst burning like a flame The flywheel
carried the piston up to the top of its stroke then water was used to
cool the burnt gases which also escaped through valves the latter
closing when the piston had reached the top of its stroke A partial
vacuum was formed and the atmospheric pressure did work on the piston
on its down stroke A number of cylinders were required in this engine
three being shown in the specification all connected to the same
crankshaft According to the Mechanics Magazine such an engine with
a complete gas generating plant was fitted to a boat which ran as an
experiment upon the Thames
A twocylinder engine working on to a beam was built in Paris but no
useful results were obtained
Wrights engine of 1833 used a mixture of combustible gas and air which
operated like steam in a steam engine This engine had a waterjacket
centrifugal governor and flame ignition In 1838 Barnett applied the
principle of compression to a singleacting engine He also employed a
gas and air pump which were placed respectively on either side of the
engine cylinder communication being established between the receiver
into which the pumps delivered and the working cylinder as the charge
was fired The doubleacting engines which Barnett devised later were
not so successful
From this time to about 1860 very few practical developments are
recorded A number of French and English patents were taken out
referring to hydrogen motors but are not of much practical value
Lenoirs patent dating from 24th January 1860 refers to a form of
engine which received considerable commercial support and consequently
became very popular A manufacturer named Marinoni built several of
these engines which were set to work in Paris in a short time Then
due to sudden demand the Lenoir Company was formed to undertake the
manufacture of these engines It was claimed that a 4horsepower engine
could be run at a cost of 34 shillings per day or just one half the
cost of a steam engine using 99 pounds of coal per horsepower per
hour Many similar exaggerated accounts of their economy in consumption
were circulated and the public on the strength of these figures
bought
It was understood that 176 cubic ft of gas were required per
horsepower per hour but it was found that as much as 105 cubic ft
were often consumed The discrepancy between the stated figures and the
actual performance of the engine was a disappointment to the using
public and as a result the Lenoir engine got a bad name
Hugon director of the Parisian gasworks who together with Reithmann
a watchmaker of Munich hotly contested Lenoirs priority to this
invention brought out a modification of this engine He cooled the
cylinder by injecting water as well as using a waterjacket and used
flame instead of electric ignition The consumption was now brought down
to 875 cubic ft
At the second Parisian International Exhibition 1867 an atmospheric
engine invented by Otto  Langen about this time was shown In this
engine a free piston was used in a vertical cylinder the former being
thrown up by the force of the explosion The only work done on the
upstroke was that to overcome the weight of the piston and piston rod
and the latter being made in the form of a rack engaged with a toothed
wheel on the axle as the piston descended causing the flywheel and
pulley to rotate
Barsanti and Matteucci were engaged in devising and experimenting with
an engine very similar to this some years before but Otto  Langen no
doubt worked quite independently Barsantis engine never became a
commercial article while Otto  Langens firm it is said held their
own for ten years and turned out about 4000 engines In 1862 the French
engineer Beau de Rochas laid down the necessary conditions which must
prevail in order to obtain maximum efficiency His patent says there are
four conditions for perfectly utilising the force of expansion of gas in
an engine
1 Largest possible cylinder volume contained by a minimum of surface
2 The highest possible speed of working
3 Maximum expansion
4 Maximum pressure at beginning of expansion
These are the conditions and principles briefly stated that combine to
form the now wellknown cycle upon which most gas engines work at the
present time
It was not until 1876 fifteen years after these principles had been
enumerated that Otto carried them into practical effect when he brought
out a new type of engine with compression before ignition higher
piston speed more rapid expansion and a general reduction of
dimensions for a given power Due to this achievement the cycle above
referred to has always been termed the Otto cycle
CHAPTER II
THE COMPONENT PARTS OF AN ENGINE
Having recounted very briefly the chief points in the development of the
gas engine from its beginning we may proceed to deal with matters of
perhaps more practical interest to those who we are assuming have had
little or no actual experience in making or working internal combustion
engines
The modern gas engine comprises comparatively few parts Apart from the
two main castingsthe bed and cylindera small engine generally
speaking consists of four fundamental members viz the valves and
their operating mechanism the cams and levers the ignition device for
firing the charge and the governing mechanism for regulating the supply
and admission of the explosive charge There are innumerable designs of
each one of these parts and no two makes are precisely alike in detail
as every maker employs his own method of achieving the same end namely
the production of an engine which comprises maximum efficiency with a
minimum of wear and tear and attention
Therefore before dealing with each of these primary parts in an
arbitrary manner and with the cycle of operations in detail we propose
to make the reader familiar with the general arrangement and method of
working which usually obtains in the smaller power engines In the
following illustrations these parts are shown A fig 1 is the
ignition device which carries the ignition tube to fire the charge H
and I fig 2 are the main valves and GC fig 1 is the gascock
The side or cam shaft N sometimes called the 2 to 1 shaft the cams
which move the levers M the latter in turn operating the valves and
causing them to open and close at the proper time are shown in fig 11
A bracket bolted up to the side of cylinder forms a bearing for one end
of the side shaft and also carries a spindle at its lower end on which
the levers oscillate transmitting the motion imparted to them by the
cams to the valves The main cylinder casting and the bed need no
description In some cases the bed is in two portions though now a
great many makers are discarding the lower portion altogether having
found that it is cheaper and quite as satisfactory to use a builtup
foundation instead and if necessary to cut a trough for the flywheel
to run it This arrangement however only obtains where larger engines
are concerned A halfcompression handle by which the exhaust cam is
moved laterally on the side shaft as required is not needed on very
small engines
Illustration FIG 1General Arrangement of a Gas Engine and
Accessories
Further reference will be made to this in another chapter and
although this is not a necessity on a small engine it is always
employed on engines over 2 BHP In fig 1 HW is the cooling water
outlet and CW the inlet A small drain cock is shown at DC through
which the water in the cylinder waterjacket may be drawn off when
required The pipes leading to the inlet and outlet of this supply are
connected to the cooling water tank by means of a couple of broad flat
nuts and lead washers one inside and the other outside the tank the
latter when clamped up well making a perfectly watertight joint The
outlet pipe making an acute angle with the side of tank the washers
used there should be wedgeshape in section It is also desirable to fit
a stopcock SC so that the pipes can be disconnected from the engine
entirely or the waterjacket emptied without running the whole of the
water out of the tank The exhaust pipe EP is made up of gasbarrel It
should lead from the engine to the silencer or exhaust box if one is
found to be necessary as directly as possible ie with no more
bends than are needed and what there are should not be acute The
silencer can be inside or outside the engineroom whichever is most
convenient but both it and the exhaust piping should be kept from all
direct contact with woodwork and at the same time in a readily
accessible position
Beyond the exhaustpipe and box and the watertank the gas bag GB and
gas meter where small powers are concerned the ordinary house or
workshop lighting meter may be used without inconvenience are the only
other accessories which are included in a small installation
Illustration FIG 2A Section of a Gas Engine
Fig 2 gives a sectional view showing the cylinder and liner The
latter is a very desirable feature in any type of gas engine but
especially in the larger sizes for at any future time should it be
found necessary to rebore the liner it can be removed with comparative
ease and is moreover more readily dealt with in the lathe than the
whole cylinder casting would be
The liner is virtually a castiron tube with a specially shaped flange
at either end At the back end the joint between it and the cylinder
casting has to be very carefully made This is a water and explosion
joint hence it has not only to prevent water entering the cylinder from
the waterjacket but also to be sufficiently strong to withstand the
pressure generated in the cylinder when the charge is fired For this
purpose specially prepared coppered asbestos rings are used which will
stand both water and intense heat Sometimes a copper ring alone is
employed to make the joint At the front end the liner is just a good
fit and enters the bed easily and a couple of bolts fitted in
corresponding lugs on the liner pass through the back end of cylinder
casting so that by tightening up these the joint at back end is made
secure A small groove is cut on a flange and a rubber ring of about
14in sectional diameter is inserted here when the liner is fitted
into the cylinder casting This makes the waterjacket joint at the
front end
Illustration FIG 3
Illustration FIG 5
Illustration FIG 4
Lugs are provided on the bed and cylinder castings and are bored to
receive steel boltsthree are sufficient provided the metal in and
around these lugs is not pinched In some cases a continuous flange is
provided on both bed and cylinder and a number of bolts inserted all
the way round This however is unnecessary and has a somewhat clumsy
appearance When these bolts are tightened up the cylinder and liner
are clamped firmly to the bed but the liner being free at the open end
can expand longitudinally without causing stresses in the cylinder
casting
The combustion chamber K is virtually part of the cylinder and has
approximately equal to onefourth the total volume of the cylinder The
shape varies somewhat in different makes of engines in some it is
rectangular with all the corners well rounded off in others it is
practically a continuation of the cylinder ie it is circular in
crosssection with the back end more or less spherical while again
it is made slightly oval in crosssection but in every case the corners
should be well curved and rounded off so that there is no one part
which is liable to become heated disproportionately with the rest of the
casting in fact in the whole cylinder casting there should be no
sudden change but a uniformity in the thickness of the metal employed
This point should be carefully remembered although it applies more
particularly to those parts of the casting subjected to higher
temperatures than the rest
The main bearings are usually of brass or gunmetal and are adjusted
for running in the same manner as any steam or other engines would be
The brasses are in halves and are held down by the castiron caps as
shown in fig 1
These bearings require extremely little attention and do not show the
wear and tear of running nearly so soon as the connectingrod brasses
These too are usually of brass or gunmetal but there are various
forms of construction employed in connection with the back end or piston
pin bearings On very small engines the connecting rod is swollen at the
back end in the forging and then machined up and drilled as shown in
fig 3 In this hole the brasses are inserted after being scraped up to
a good fit on the piston pin
A flat is cut on one of the brasses and a set screw is fitted as
shown to prevent any movement of the latter after the final adjustment
has been made A lock nut should be used in conjunction with this set
screw Another method and one more generally used on larger engines is
shown in fig 4 In this case the brasses are larger than in the former
where they are virtually a split bush here they have holes drilled in
them to take the bolts the latter usually and preferably being turned
up to the shape shown in fig 5
CHAPTER III
HOW A GAS ENGINE WORKS
The gas engine of the present day although from a structural point of
view is very different to the early engine or even that of fifteen
years ago is in respect to the principle upon which it works very
similar The greater number of smaller power engines in use in this
country work on what is known as the Otto or fourcycle principle and
it is with this class of engine we propose to deal
Reference to the various diagrams in the text will help considerably
and make it an easy matter for any reader hitherto totally unacquainted
with such engines to see why and how they work
Coalgas consists primarily of five other gases mixed together in
certain proportions these proportions varying slightly in different
parts of the countryHydrogen H 50 marsh gas CH4 38
carbonmonoxide 4 olefines C6H4 4 nitrogen N 4
Gas alone is not explosive and before any practical use can be made
of it a considerable quantity of air has to be added diluting it down
to approximately ten parts air to one of pure gas This mixture is now
highly explosive
The reader will do well to bear these facts constantly in mind
especially when he is repairing adjusting or experimenting with a gas
engine We wish to emphasise this at the outset because a consideration
of these facts will keep cropping up throughout all our dealings with
the gas engine and if once a fairly clear conception is obtained of how
gas will behave under certain and various conditions half or even more
than half our troubles will disappear the cry that the gas engine
has gone wrong will be heard less often and users would soon learn
that the gas engine is in reality as worthy of their confidence as any
other form of power generator in common use
But to revert to the explanation of the cycle of operations The cycle
is completed in four strokes of the piston ie two revolutions of
the crank shaft
At the commencement of the first outstroke the charging or suction
stroke gas and air are admitted to the cylinder through the respective
valves fig 6 and continue to be drawn in by what may be termed the
sucking action of the piston until the completion of this stroke the
precise position of the closing and opening of the valves will be
referred to later on The next stroke fig 7 is the compression
stroke All the valves are closed whilst the piston moves inwards
compressing the gases until at the end of this stroke and at the
instant of maximum compression the highly explosive charge is fired by
means of the hot tube or an electric spark as the case may be The
ensuing strokethe second outstroke of the cycleis the result of the
explosion the expanding gases driving the piston rapidly before them
this then is the expansion or working stroke fig 8
Illustration FIG 6Commencement of first outstroke suction or
charging stroke Gas and air valve about to open
Illustration FIG 7Compression stroke during which all valves
remain closed
During the lastthe second inwardstroke fig 9 the exhaust valve is
opened and the returning piston sweeps all the burnt gases the product
of combustion out into the exhaust pipe and so into the atmosphere
This completes the cycle and the piston crank and valves are in the
same relative positions as formerly and the same series of operations
is repeated again and again Of course it is not always the case that
both air and gas valve are opened on the charging stroke that depends
upon the method employed to govern the speed of the engine Supposing
it were governed on the hit and miss principle to be explained
hereafter the gas valve would be allowed to remain closed during the
charging stroke and air alone would be drawn into the cylinder then
compressed but not being explosive would simply expand again on the
working stroke giving back nearly all the energy which was absorbed in
compressing it and finally be exhausted in the same manner as the burnt
gases are
Illustration FIG 8Second out stroke showing position of valves
during working stroke
Illustration FIG 9Second inward stroke showing position of valves
during the exhaust stroke
Illustration FIG 10First outstroke showing position of valves
during the charging stroke
Fig 10 shows diagrammatically the position of crank piston and
valves during the charging stroke
Illustration FIG 11Cross Section of Cylinder
In figs 1 and 2 we gave drawings of two gas engines which are typical
examples of modern practice Huge strides have been made in recent years
in gasengine work as regards both workmanship and efficiency so that
today we have in the gas engine a machine whose mechanical efficiency
compares favourably with that of any other power generator and whose
thermal efficiency is very much greater
Illustration FIG 12Longitudinal Section of Cylinder
Figs 11 and 12 show respectively a sectional end and side elevation of
the cylinder from which it will not be difficult for the reader
however unacquainted he may be with gasengine work to see how the
various requirements and peculiarities of the engine should be
considered and provided for
A most important desideratum in any machine or engine is that it shall
be as simple in construction as ever possible complicated mechanism
should only be introduced when such addition or complication compensates
adequately for what must necessarily be a higher first cost and
incidentally the greater wear and tear and attention involved Figs 11
and 12 show what has been done to simplify the construction of the gas
engine in recent years The main feature in this case is the very
getatable position of the two main valvesthe air valve F and the
exhaust E These valves as may be seen from the drawing are capable of
withdrawal after the cover of the combustion chamber has been removed
The latter is an iron casting shaped and faced up to make an absolutely
tight joint no asbestos or any packing is used to make this jointand
is held in place by four studs as shown Thus all that is necessary is
to remove the four nuts lift the cover off then pull out the pins
which keep the spiral springs in position and withdraw the valves The
latter are seated direct on to the metal of the cylinder casting the
gunmetal bushes A and B acting as guides Further reference to A the
mixer which serves a twofold purpose will be made later on
The gas valve and cock are mounted in a separate casting which is
carried by a couple of studs the joint between this and cylinder being
made with a piece of rubber insertion The gas enters at the gascock
passes through the valve and port G and round the annular space in the
bush or mixer A previously mentioned and thence through a number of
small holes in same immediately below the seat of the air valve F At
the same time pure air is drawn in via the air box as explained
hereafter through port L fig 11 and thence up the centre of bush A
and over the small holes through which the gas is flowing The two then
thoroughly mix and enter the combustion chamber together as the air
valve F is opened This device produces a perfectly homogeneous mixture
which conduces in no small measure to perfect combustion when the
explosion takes place and upon which to a very great extent depends
the efficiency of the engine Besides possible loss in this direction
however there is another source of waste which cannot be eliminated
and that is the heat taken away by the cooling water which surrounds the
cylinder As this loss is inevitable the best thing we can do is to
make it as small as possible Theoretically it would be no small
advantage if we could work at very much higher temperatures than we do
at the present time and it is only certain mechanical difficulties
which bar the way and so effectually prevent the already high thermal
efficiency of the engine being greatly increased
It is no easy matter to overcome these difficulties completely but
improvements in this direction are continually being made so that
troubles which attended the gasengine user years ago no longer exist
All that we require of the cooling water is that it shall keep certain
working parts of the engine at a reasonable temperature for instance
the cylinder must not be so hot as to deprive the lubricating oil of its
property to lubricate neither must the exhaust valve become so hot as
to cause it to seize in the bush and stick up but beyond such
considerations as these the higher the temperature is at the
commencement of each explosion the more efficient will the engine be
The object then is to do as little cooling as possible and to apply
the cooling effect at the right parts hence the passages and chambers
through which the cooling water circulates should be so arranged that
those which require to be kept at a low temperature are in close
proximity to the cooling water On some of the engines of days gone by
the exhaust valve was carried in a large iron casting this in turn
being bolted to the cylinder casting and communicating with the
combustion chamber by means of a port Such an arrangement was found to
be not only clumsy but inefficient the water passages were small and
difficult to get at they readily furred up and moreover the joint
between this casting and the cylinder was necessarily a water and
explosion joint and the fewer we have of these the better
The methodif it may be called a methodof overcoming or preventing
the exhaust valve becoming too hot is in the case of figs 11 and 12
simply one of judicious arrangement and design The cooling water enters
by the inlet K fig 11 and circulates round the exhaust valve port X
and valve E immediately before becoming heated thus keeping the
hottest of the working parts of the engine at a suitable temperature
and the valve seat being in direct metallic communication with the cold
water does not become burnt or pitted On the other side of the exhaust
valve we have the air valve and its passages through which cool air is
continually being drawn this also helps to keep the exhaust valve cool
From this then we may conclude that overheating of the cylinder will
not occur under normal conditions given an engine of good design but
if this trouble does arise we may safely look first of all for some
defect in the cooling water circulation Some waters contain a greater
amount of impurities than others and consequently the water space may
furr up more rapidly in one district than in another But this deposit
even under the worst conditions accumulates very slowly and the
operation of cleaning out the waterjacket is a very infrequent
necessity The exhaust valve however may become overheated if it is
allowed to get into bad condition ie leaky Its seat should be
well looked after or the hot gases will blow past when it is
presumably shut and if this defect slight though it may be to begin
with is allowed to develop both the seat the valve head and the
spindle will become burnt away and pitted perhaps badly due to the
excessive heat
CHAPTER IV
IGNITION DEVICES
The ignition devices commonly employed may be divided into three main
classesthe metal tube the porcelain tube and the electric ignition
These again may be subdivided The first being either iron or nickel
hecknum as they are sometimes called the second are of two
kindssingleended and doubleended and the third takes many forms
which many of my readers are possibly well acquainted with such as the
magneto the induction coil and trembler and the hightension magneto
ignition the latter device having been used successfully on various
occasions though not yet universally adopted
The firstnamed have one or two advantages over the nickel tube They
are very inexpensive and are easily heated to the required temperature
moreover they can be made at home should occasion demand On the other
hand they are not so durable have a very uncertain life and
consequently need renewing frequentlytheir average life being not
more than 60 working hours Fig 13 gives an outline drawing of an iron
tube with its burner and chimney fixed in position The tube is very
similar to a piece of 14in gasbarrel closed up at one end and a
taper thread 14in gas cut on the other in fact gasbarrel may be
used for making these tubes at homeand measure about 7 or 8 in over
all It is screwed into a firing block which in turn is screwed into the
combustion chamber end so that when right home it is in such position
that the tube stands quite vertical The section of the tube fig 13
shows the condition it gets into after having been in use some time The
bore it will be seen has become almost completely closed up so that
there is practically no communication between the hot part of the tube
and the combustion chamber This closing up of the bore is very gradual
and it is in the early stages of this process that erratic firing is
likely to occur sometimes the charge will be successfully fired and
sometimes not It may be as well to mention here that the length of the
tube although to a certain extent immaterial should neither be
excessively long nor abnormally short the precise length varying with
the size of the engine A 14in tube 8 ins long may be used
successfully on engines ranging from 12 to 6 horsepower provided a
suitable burner is fitted enabling the tube to be heated at any required
spot After the first charge has been fired and the exhaust takes
place practically all the burnt gases are cleared out of the cylinder
but a small amount of these will generally remain in the tube and the
bore of the firing block On the ensuing compression stroke these inert
gases are compressed to the far end of the tube thus making way for the
explosive mixture to reach the hot portion and explode thus sending a
jet of flame into the main volume of the mixture which is immediately
ignited Hence there is no advantage in having a tube too long while
on the other hand it must not be too short
Illustration FIG 13
Illustration FIG 14
Illustration FIG 15
The asbestos lining shown in fig 13 may be of various thicknesses
according to the size of the chimney and the tube the reason for this
will be apparent to many but being a most important factor in the
heating of the tube and consequently the working of the engine it will
be advisable to deal with this point more fully
Due mainly to the peculiar behaviour of iron tubes under heat and
internal pressure it is always advisable to look to them first of all
when the engine shows signs of missing fire and to always examine the
bore of a fresh one and ascertain that it is perfectly clear before
putting it in The adjustment of the ignition tube although one of the
most important and necessary to be made on the whole engine is in
itself a perfectly simple matter It must be understood that the
ignition tube cannot with the ordinary means at our disposal be kept
at too high a temperature but it must not be assumed that either the
size of the flame or the time the flame has been alight is
conclusive evidence that the tube is or ought to be sufficiently hot
to fire the charge successfully It is an uncommon thing to hear a man
exclaimafter it has been pointed out that his tube is practically
coldWhy its been alight for hours
