jogtrot all the way But to redeem it all with the pleasantness of
beauty and the charm of significance this laurel branch
II
Our language does not possess any single word wherewith to sum up the
various categories of things made by nature or made by man intended
solely for the purpose of subserving by mere coincidence which
minister to our organic and manysided sthetic instincts the things
affecting us in that absolutely special unmistakable and hitherto
mysterious manner expressed in our finding them beautiful It is of
the part which such thingswhether actually present or merely
shadowed in our mindcan play in our life and of the influence of
the instinct for beauty on the other instincts making up our nature
that I would treat in these pages And for this reason I have been
glad to accept from the hands of chance and of that roadmender of
the tramway the bay laurel as a symbol of what we have no word to
express the aggregate of all art all poetry and particularly of all
poetic and artistic vision and emotion
For the Bay LaurelLaurus Nobilis of botanistshappens to be not
merely the evergreen unfading plant into which Apollo metamorphosed
while pursuing the maiden whom he loved even as the poet the artist
turns into immortal shapes his own quite personal and transient moods
or as the fairest realities nobly sought are transformed made
evergreen and restoratively fragrant for all time in our memory and
fancy It is a plant of noblest utility averting as the ancients
thought lightning from the dwellings it surrounded even as
disinterested love for beauty averts from our minds the dangers which
fall on the vain and the covetous and curing many aches and fevers
even as the contemplation of beauty refreshes and invigorates our
spirit Indeed we seem to be reading a description no longer of the
virtues of the bay laurel but of the virtues of all beautiful
sights and sounds of all beautiful thoughts and emotions in reading
the following quaint and charming words of an old herbal
The bay leaves are of as necessary use as any other in garden or
orchard for they serve both for pleasure and profit both for
ornament and use both for honest civil uses and for physic yea
both for the sick and for the sound both for the living and for
the dead The bay serveth to adorn the house of God as well as of
man to procure warmth comfort and strength to the limbs of men
and women to season vessels wherein are preserved our meats as
well as our drinks to crown or encircle as a garland the heads of
the living and to stick and deck forth the bodies of the dead so
that from the cradle to the grave we have still use of it we
have still need of it
III
Before beginning to expound the virtues of Beauty let me however
insist that these all depend upon the simple and mysterious fact
thatwell that the Beautiful is the Beautiful In our discussion of
what the Bay Laurel symbolises let us keep clear in our memory the
lovely shape of the sacred tree and the noble places in which we have
seen it
There are bay twigs gathered together in bronze sheaves in the great
garland surrounding Ghibertis Gates of Paradise There are two
interlaced branches of bay crispedged and slender carved in fine
low relief inside the marble chariot in the Vatican There is a
fanshaped growth of Apollos Laurel behind that Venetian portrait of
a poet which was formerly called Ariosto by Titian And most
suggestive of all there are the Mycenaean bay leaves of beaten gold
so incredibly thin one might imagine them to be the withered crown of
a nameless singer in a forgotten tongue grown brittle through three
thousand years and more
Each of such presentments embodying with loving skill some feature of
the plant enhances by association the charm of its reality
accompanying the delight of real baytrees and bay leaves with
inextricable harmonics vague recollections of the delight of bronze
of delicately cut marble of marvellously beaten gold of deep
Venetian crimson and black and auburn
But best of all most satisfying and significant is the remembrance
of the baytrees themselves They greatly affect the troughs of
watercourses among whose rocks and embanked masonry they love to
strike their roots In such a stream trough on a spur of the Hill of
Fiesole grow the most beautiful poets laurels I can think of The
place is one of those hollowings out of a hillside which revealing
how high they lie only by the skylines of distant hills always feel
so pleasantly remote And the peace and austerity of this little
valley are heightened by the dovecot of a farm invisible in the
oliveyards and looking like a hermitages belfry The olives are
scant and wan in the fields all round with here and there the blossom
of an almond the oak woods of faint wintry copperrose encroach
above and in the grassy space lying open to the sky the mountain
brook is dyked into a weir whence the crystalline white water leaps
into a chain of shady pools And there on the brink of that weir and
all along that streams shallow upper course among grass and brakes of
reeds are the baytrees I speak of groups of three or four at
intervals each a sheaf of smooth tapering boles tufted high up with
evergreen leaves sparse bunches whose outermost leaves are sharply
printed like lanceheads against the sky Most modest little trees
with their scant berries and rare pale buds not trees at all I fancy
some people saying Yet of more consequence somehow in their calm
disregard of wind their cheerful resolute soaring than any other
trees for miles masters of that little valley of its rocks pools
and overhanging foliage sovereign brothers and rustic demigods for
whom the violets scent the air among the withered grass in March and
in May the nightingales sing through the quivering star night
Of all southern trees most simple and aspiring and certainly most
perfect among evergreens with their straight faintly carmined
shoots their pliable strong leaves so subtly rippled at the edge and
their clean dry fragrance delicate austere alert serene such are
the baytrees of Apollo
IV
I have gladly accepted from the hands of that tramway roadmender
the Bay LaurelLaurus Nobilisfor a symbol of all art all poetry
and all poetic and artistic vision and emotion It has summed up
better than words could do what the old Herbals call the virtues
of all beautiful things and beautiful thoughts And it has suggested
I hope the contents of the following notes the nature of my attempt
to trace the influence which art should have on life
V
Beauty save by a metaphorical application of the word is not in the
least the same thing as Goodness any more than beauty despite
Keats famous assertion is the same thing as Truth These three
objects of the souls pursuit have different natures different laws
and fundamentally different origins But the energies which express
themselves in their pursuitenergies vital primordial and necessary
even to mans physical survivalhave all been evolved under the same
stress of adaptation of the human creature to its surroundings and
have therefore in their beginnings and in their ceaseless growth
been working perpetually in concert meeting crossing and
strengthening one another until they have become indissolubly woven
together by a number of great and organic coincidences
It is these coincidences which all higher philosophy from Plato
downwards has strained for ever to expound It is these coincidences
which all religion and all poetry have taken for granted And to three
of these it is that I desire to call attention persuaded as I am that
the scientific progress of our day will make short work of all the
spurious stheticism and all the shortsighted utilitarianism which
have cast doubts upon the intimate and vital connection between beauty
and every other noble object of our living
The three coincidences I have chosen are that between development of
the sthetic faculties and the development of the altruistic
instincts that between development of a sense of sthetic harmony and
a sense of the higher harmonies of universal life and before
everything else the coincidence between the preference for sthetic
pleasures and the nobler growth of the individual
VI
The particular emotion produced in us by such things as are beautiful
works of art or of nature recollections and thoughts as well as
sights and sounds the emotion of sthetic pleasure has been
recognised ever since the beginning of time as of a mysteriously
ennobling quality All philosophers have told us that and the
religious instinct of all mankind has practically proclaimed it by
employing for the worship of the highest powers nay by employing for
the mere designation of the godhead beautiful sights and sounds and
words by which beautiful sights and sounds are suggested Nay there
has always lurked in mens minds and expressed itself in the
metaphors of mens speech an intuition that the Beautiful is in some
manner one of the primordial and so to speak cosmic powers of the
world The theories of various schools of mental science and the
practice of various schools of art the practice particularly of the
persons styled by themselves sthetes and by others decadents have
indeed attempted to reduce mans relations with the great worldpower
Beauty to mere intellectual dilettantism or sensual superfineness But
the general intuition has not been shaken the intuition which
recognised in Beauty a superhuman and in that sense a truly divine
power And now it must become evident that the methods of modern
psychology of the great new science of body and soul are beginning
to explain the reasonableness of this intuition or at all events to
show very plainly in what direction we must look for the explanation
of it This much can already be asserted and can be indicated even
to those least versed in recent psychological study to wit that the
power of Beauty the essential power therefore of art is due to the
relations of certain visible and audible forms with the chief mental
and vital functions of all human beings relations established
throughout the whole process of human and perhaps even of animal
evolution relations seated in the depths of our activities but
radiating upwards even like our vague organic sense of comfort and
discomfort and permeating even like our obscure relations with
atmospheric conditions into our highest and clearest consciousness
colouring and altering the whole groundwork of our thoughts and
feelings
Such is the primordial and in a sense the cosmic power of the
Beautiful a power whose very growth whose constantly more complex
nature proclaims its necessary and beneficial action in human
evolution It is the power of making human beings live for the
moment in a more organically vigorous and harmonious fashion as
mountain air or seawind makes them live but with the difference that
it is not merely the bodily but very essentially the spiritual life
the life of thought and emotion which is thus raised to unusual
harmony and vigour I may illustrate this matter by a very individual
instance which will bring to the memory of each of my readers the
vivifying power of some beautiful sight or sound or beautiful
description I was seated working by my window depressed by the
London outlook of narrow grey sky endless grey roofs and rusty elm
tops when I became conscious of a certain increase of vitality
almost as if I had drunk a glass of wine because a band somewhere
outside had begun to play After various indifferent pieces it began
a tune by Handel or in Handels style of which I have never known
the name calling it for myself the Te Deum Tune And then it seemed
as if my soul and according to the sensations in a certain degree my
body even were caught up on those notes and were striking out as if
swimming in a great breezy sea or as if it had put forth wings and
risen into a great free space of air And noticing my feelings I
seemed to be conscious that those notes were being played on me my
fibres becoming the strings so that as the notes moved and soared and
swelled and radiated like stars and suns I also being identified
with the sound having become apparently the sound itself must needs
move and soar with them
We can all recollect a dozen instances when architecture music
painting or some sudden sight of sea or mountain have thus affected
us and all poetry particularly all great lyric poetry Goethes
Shelleys Wordsworths and above all Brownings is full of the
record of such experience
I have said that the difference between this sthetic heightening of
our vitality and this that I have been describing is I pray you to
observe the sthetic phenomenon par excellence and such other
heightening of vitality as we experience from going into fresh air and
sunshine or taking fortifying food the difference between the
sthetic and the mere physiological pleasurable excitement consists
herein that in the case of beauty it is not merely our physical but
our spiritual life which is suddenly rendered more vigorous We do not
merely breathe better and digest better though that is no small
gain but we seem to understand better Under the vitalising touch of
the Beautiful our consciousness seems filled with the affirmation of
what life is what is worth being what among our many thoughts and
acts and feelings are real and organic and important what among the
many possible moods is the real eternal ourself
Such are the great forces of Nature gathered up in what we call the
sthetic phenomenon and it is these forces of Nature which stolen
from heaven by the man of genius or the nation of genius and welded
together in music or architecture in the arts of visible design or
of written thoughts give to the great work of art its power to
quicken the life of our soul
VII
I hope I have been able to indicate how by its essential nature by
the primordial power it embodies all Beauty and particularly Beauty
in art tends to fortify and refine the spiritual life of the
individual
But this is only half of the question for in order to get the full
benefit of beautiful things and beautiful thoughts to obtain in the
highest potency those potent sthetic emotions the individual must
undergo a course of selftraining of selfinitiation which in its
turn elicits and improves some of the highest qualities of his soul
Nay as every great writer on art has felt from Plato to Ruskin but
none has expressed as clearly as Mr Pater in all true sthetic
training there must needs enter an ethical element almost an ascetic
one
The greatest art bestows pleasure just in proportion as people are
capable of buying that pleasure at the price of attention
intelligence and reverent sympathy For great art is such as is
richly endowed full of variety subtlety and suggestiveness full of
delightfulness enough for a lifetime the lifetime of generations and
generations of men great art is to its true lovers like Cleopatra to
Antonyage cannot wither it nor custom stale its infinite variety
Indeed when it is the greatest art of all the art produced by the
marvellous artist the most gifted race and the longest centuries we
find ourselves in presence of something which like Nature itself
contains more beauty suggests more thought works more miracles than
anyone of us has faculties to appreciate fully So that in some of
Titians pictures and Michael Angelos frescoes the great Greek
sculptures certain cantos of Dante and plays of Shakespeare fugues
of Bach scenes of Mozart and quartets of Beethoven we can each of
us looking our closest feeling our uttermost see and feel perhaps
but a trifling portion of what there is to be seen and felt leaving
other sides other perfections to be appreciated by our neighbours
Till it comes to pass that we find different persons very differently
delighted by the same masterpiece and accounting most discrepantly
for their delight in it
Now such pleasure as this requires not merely a vast amount of
activity on our part since all pleasure even the lowest is the
expression of an activity it requires a vast amount of attention of
intelligence of what in races or in individuals means special
training
VIII
There is a sad confusion in mens minds on the very essential subject
of pleasure We tend most of us to oppose the idea of pleasure to
the idea of work effort strenuousness patience and therefore
recognise as pleasures only those which cost none of these things or
as little as possible pleasures which instead of being produced
through our will and act impose themselves upon us from outside In
all artfor art stands halfway between the sensual and emotional
experiences and the experiences of the mere reasoning intellectin
all art there is necessarily an element which thus imposes itself upon
us from without an element which takes and catches us colour
strangeness of outline sentimental or terrible quality rhythm
exciting the muscles or clang which tickles the ear But the art
which thus takes and catches our attention the most easily asking
nothing in return or next to nothing is also the poorest art the
oleograph the pretty woman in the fashion plate the caricature the
representation of some domestic or harrowing scene children being put
to bed babes in the wood railway accidents etc or again dance or
march music and the equivalents of all this in verse It catches your
attention instead of your attention conquering it but it speedily
ceases to interest gives you nothing more cloys or comes to a dead
stop It resembles thus far mere sensual pleasure a savoury dish a
glass of good wine an excellent cigar a warm bed which impose
themselves on the nerves without expenditure of attention with the
result of course that little or nothing remains a sensual
impression dying so to speak childless a barren disconnected
thing without place in the memory unmarried as it is to the memorys
clients thought and human feeling
If so many people prefer poor art to great tis because they refuse
to give through inability or unwillingness as much of their soul
as great art requires for its enjoyment And it is noticeable that
busy men coming to art for pleasure when they are too weary for
looking listening or thinking so often prefer the sensationnovel
the musichall song and such painting as is but a costlier kind of
oleograph treating all other art as humbug and art in general as a
trifle wherewith to wile away a lazy moment a trifle about which
every man can know what he likes best
Thus it is that great art makes by coincidence the same demands as
noble thinking and acting For even as all noble sports develop
muscle develop eye skill quickness and pluck in bodily movement
qualities which are valuable also in the practical business of life
so also the appreciation of noble kinds of art implies the acquisition
of habits of accuracy of patience of respectfulness and suspension
of judgment of preference of future good over present of harmony and
clearness of sympathy when we come to literary art judgment and
kindly fairness which are all of them useful to our neighbours and
ourselves in the many contingencies and obscurities of real life Now
this is not so with the pleasures of the senses the pleasures of the
senses do not increase by sharing and sometimes cannot be shared at
all they are moreover evanescent leaving us no richer above all
they cultivate in ourselves qualities useful only for that particular
enjoyment Thus a highly discriminating palate may have saved the
life of animals and savages but what can its subtleness do nowadays
beyond making us into gormandisers and winebibbers or at best into
cooks and tasters for the service of gormandising and winebibbing
persons
IX
Delight in beautiful things and in beautiful thoughts requires
therefore a considerable exercise of the will and the attention such
as is not demanded by our lower enjoyments Indeed it is probably
this absence of moral and intellectual effort which recommends such
lower kinds of pleasure to a large number of persons I have said
lower kinds of pleasure because there are other enjoyments besides
those of the senses which entail no moral improvement in ourselves
the enjoyments connected with vanity and greed We should noteven if
any of us could be sure of being impeccable on these pointswe should
not be too hard on the persons and the classes of persons who are
conscious of no other kind of enjoyment They are not necessarily
base not necessarily sensual or vain because they care only for
bodily indulgence for notice and gain They are very likely not base
but only apathetic slothful or very tired The noble sport the
intellectual problem the great work of art the divinely beautiful
effect in Nature require that one should give oneself the
Frenchcooked dinner as much as the pot of beer the game of chance
whether with clean cards at a club or with greasy ones in a taproom
the outdoing of ones neighbours whether by the ragged heroes of Zola
or the wellgroomed heroes of Balzac require no such coming forward
of the soul they take us without any need for our giving
ourselves Hence as I have just said the preference for them does
not imply original baseness but only lack of higher energy We can
judge of the condition of those who can taste no other pleasures by
remembering what the best of us are when we are tired or ill vaguely
craving for interests sensations emotions variety but quite unable
to procure them through our own effort and longing for them to come
to us from without Now in our still very badly organised world an
enormous number of people are condemned by the tyranny of poverty or
the tyranny of fashion to be when the days work or the days
business is done in just such a condition of fatigue and languor of
craving therefore for the baser kinds of pleasure We all recognise
that this is the case with what we call poor people and that this
is why poor people are apt to prefer the publichouse to the picture
gallery or the concertroom It would be greatly to the purpose were
we to acknowledge that it is largely the case with the rich and that
for that reason the rich are apt to take more pleasure in ostentatious
display of their properties than in contemplation of such beauty as is
accessible to all men Indeed it is one of the ironies of the
barbarous condition we are pleased to call civilisation that so
many rich menthousands dailyare systematically toiling and moiling
till they are unable to enjoy any pleasure which requires vigour of
mind and attention rendering themselves impotent from sheer fatigue
to enjoy the delights which life gives generously to all those who
fervently seek them And what for Largely for the sake of those
pleasures which can be had only for money but which can be enjoyed
without using ones soul

I was going to say to crown poets but I left my sentence in
midair because of course he knew that as well as I
Precisely he answered with intelligent interestI have noticed
that the leaves are sometimes put in sardine boxes
Soon after this conversation I discovered the curious circumstance
that one of the greatest of peoples and perhaps the most favoured by
Apollo calls Laurus Nobilis LaurierSauce The name is French the
symbol alas of universal application
This paragraph X had been intended to deal with Art as it is
understood by persons of fashion and eminent men of business
XI
Thus it is that real sthetic keennessand sthetic keenness as I
shall show you in my next chapter means appreciating beauty not
collecting beautiful propertiesthus it is that all sthetic keenness
implies a development of the qualities of patience attention
reverence and of that vigour of soul which is not called forth but
rather impaired by the coarser enjoyments of the senses and of
vanity So far therefore we have seen that the capacity for sthetic
pleasure is allied to a certain nobility in the individual I think I
can show that the preference for sthetic pleasure tends also to a
happier relation between the individual and his fellows
But the cultivation of our sthetic pleasures does not merely
necessitate our improvement in certain very essential moral qualities
It implies as much in a way as the cultivation of the intellect and
the sympathies that we should live chiefly in the spirit in which
alone as philosophers and mystics have rightly understood there is
safety from the worst miseries and room for the most complete
happiness Only we shall learn from the study of our sthetic
pleasures that while the stoics and mystics have been right in
affirming that the spirit only can give the highest good they have
been fatally wrong in the reason they gave for their preference And
we may learn from our sthetic experiences that the spirit is useful
not in detaching us from the enjoyable things of life but on the
contrary in giving us their consummate possession The spiritone of
whose most precious capacities is that it enables us to print off all
outside things on to ourselves to store moods and emotions to
recombine and reinforce past impressions into present onesthe spirit
puts pleasure more into our own keeping making it more independent of
time and place of circumstances and what is equally important
independent of other peoples strivings after pleasure by which our
own while they clash and hamper are so often impeded
XII
For our intimate commerce with beautiful things and beautiful thoughts
does not exist only or even chiefly at the moment of seeing or
hearing or reading nay if the beautiful touched us only at such
separate and special moments the beautiful would play but an
insignificant part in our existence
As a fact those moments represent very often only the act of
storage or not much more Our real sthetic life is in ourselves
often isolated from the beautiful words objects or sounds sometimes
almost unconscious permeating the whole rest of life in certain
highly sthetic individuals and however mixed with other activities
as constant as the life of the intellect and sympathies nay as
constant as the life of assimilation and motion We can live off a
beautiful object we can live by its means even when its visible or
audible image is partially nay sometimes wholly obliterated for
the emotional condition can survive the image and be awakened at the
mere name awakened sufficiently to heighten the emotion caused by
other images of beauty We can sometimes feel so to speak the
spiritual companionship and comfort of a work of art or of a scene in
nature nay almost its particular caress to our whole being when the
work of art or the scene has grown faint in our memory but the
emotion it awakened has kept warm
Now this possibility of storing for later use of increasing by
combination the impressions of beautiful things makes artand by
art I mean all sthetic activity whether in the professed artist who
creates or the unconscious artist who assimilatesthe type of such
pleasures as are within our own keeping and makes the sthetic life
typical also of that life of the spirit in which alone we can realise
any kind of human freedom We shall all of us meet with examples
thereof if we seek through our consciousness That such things
existed was made clear to me during a weary period of illness for
which I shall always be grateful since it taught me in those months
of incapacity for enjoyment that there is a safe kind of pleasure
the pleasure we can defer I spent part of that time at Tangier
surrounded by everything which could delight me and in none of which
I took any real delight I did not enjoy Tangier at the time but I
have enjoyed Tangier ever since on the principle of the bee eating
its honey months after making it The reality of Tangier I mean the
reality of my presence there and the state of my nerves were not in
the relation of enjoyment But how often has not the image of Tangier
the remembrance of what I saw and did there returned and haunted me
in the most enjoyable fashion
After all is it not often the case with pictures statues journeys
and the reading of books The weariness entailed the mere continuity
of looking or attending quite apart from tiresome accompanying
circumstances make the apparently real act what we expect to be the
act of enjoyment quite illusory like Coleridge we see not feel
how beautiful things are Later on all odious accompanying
circumstances are utterly forgotten eliminated and the weariness is
gone we enjoy not merely unhampered by accidents but in the very way
our heart desires For we can chooseour mood unconsciously does it
for usthe right moment and right accessories for consuming some of
our stored delights moreover we can add what condiments and make
what mixtures suit us best at that moment We draw not merely upon one
past reality making its essentials present but upon dozens To
revert to Tangier whose experience first brought these possibilities
clearly before me I find I enjoy it in connection with Venice the
mixture having a special roundness of tone or flavour Similarly I
once heard Bachs Magnificat with St Marks of Venice as a
background in my imagination Again certain moonlight songs of
Schumann have blended wonderfully with remembrances of old Italian
villas King Solomon in all his ships could not have carried the
things which I can draw in less than a second from one tiny
convolution of my brain from one corner of my mind No wizard that
ever lived had spells which could evoke such kingdoms and worlds as
anyone of us can conjure up with certain words Greece the Middle
Ages Orpheus Robin Hood Mary Stuart Ancient Rome the Far East
XIII
And here as fit illustration of these beneficent powers which can
free us from a life where we stifle and raise us into a life where we
can breathe and grow let me record my gratitude to a certain young
goat which on one occasion turned what might have been a detestable
hour into a pleasant one
The goat or rather kid a charming gazellelike creature with
budding horns and broad hard forehead was one of my fourteen fellow
passengers in a thirdclass carriage on a certain bank holiday
Saturday Riding and standing in such crowded misery had cast a
general gloom over all the holiday makers they seemed to have
forgotten the coming outing in sullen hatred of all their neighbours
and I confess that I too began to wonder whether Bank Holiday was an
altogether delightful institution But the goat had no such doubts
Leaning against the boy who was taking it holidaymaking it tried
very gently to climb and butt and to play with its sulky fellow
travellers And as it did so it seemed to radiate a sort of poetry on
everything vague impressions of rocks woods hedges the Alps
Italy and Greece mythology of course and that amusement of jouer
avec des chevres apprivoisees which that great charmer M Renan has
attributed to his charming Greek people Now as I realised the joy of
the goat on finding itself among the beech woods and short grass of
the Hertfordshire hills I began also to see my other fellow
