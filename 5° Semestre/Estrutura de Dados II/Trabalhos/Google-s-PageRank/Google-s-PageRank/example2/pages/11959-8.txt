short lifean attachment which is evinced many times in the course
of her memorandait may interest the American reader to know that
Liskeard is an ancient but small town in Cornwall The country around
is broken up into hill and dale sloping down to the sea a few miles
distant the rocky shores of which are dotted with fishingvillages
in an opposite direction it swells into granite hills in which
are numerous mines of copper and lead There is a good deal of
intelligence and also of religious feeling to be met with among both
the miners and fishermen Cornwall having been the scene of a great
revival in religion in the time of John Wesley the effects of which
have not been suffered to pass away A meeting of Friends has been
held at Liskeard from an early period in the history of the Society
but as in many other country places in England the numbers seem
gradually to diminish various attractions drawing the members to the
larger towns Launceston Castle so well known in connection with the
sufferings of George Fox is a few miles distant
The familycircle until broken a few years before her own marriage
by that of an elder sister consisted in addition to her parents of
five daughters two of whom were older and two younger than Eliza Her
father was long known and deservedly esteemed by Friends in England
and her mother is an approved minister John Allen was a man of
sound judgment and of liberal and enlightened views ever desirous
of upholding the truth but at the same time ready to listen to the
arguments of those who might differ from him in opinion Moderate and
cautious in counsel and conduct firm yet a peacemaker he was truly
a father in the Church For many years he took an active part in
the deliberations of the Yearly Meeting and was often employed in
services connected with the Society He was known to many Friends on
the American continent from having visited that country in 1845 by
appointment of the London Yearly Meeting He was the author of a work
entitled State Churches and the Kingdom of Christ and of several
pamphlets on religious subjects He died in 1859
John Allen retired from business at an early age and a prominent
reason for his doing so was that he might devote himself more fully to
the education of his daughters which was conducted almost entirely at
home Having a decided taste for the ancient classics he considered
that so good a foundation of a sound education ought not to be
neglected The same might be said of the older history and literature
of his own country including its poetry in which he was well read
but he fully encouraged his pupils to become acquainted also with
the better productions of the day to the tone of which their younger
minds were more easily adapted Nor was education confined to direct
instruction in the schoolroom In a little memoir of John Allen
published in the Annual Monitor we read In the domestic circle
the tender watchful care and sympathy of the parent were blended
with the constant stimulus to selfimprovement of the teacher and the
readiness to sacrifice personal ease and convenience in order that
he might enter into the pursuits and amusements of his children was
united with an unremitting endeavor to maintain a high standard of
moral and religious feeling Thus by example as well as by precept did
he evince his deep concern for their best welfare As years passed on
his cordial sympathy with their interests and his anxiety as far as
possible to share his own with them gave an additional power to his
influence not easily estimated Such were the simple and natural
means of education employed The aim was true enlargement of mind and
the desire was carefully instilled that the knowledge acquired
should be valued for its own sake not as a possession to be used for
display At the same time care was taken not to destroy the balance
between the intellect and the affections so that whilst the growth
of the mental powers was encouraged domestic and social duties
should not suffer and habits of selfreliance should be formed From
earliest childhood the great principles of Christianity were instilled
into the opening minds of the children and when the reflective powers
had come into operation their reasonings were watched and guided into
safe paths In this object as in all the pursuits of her children
was the loving influence of a watchful mother gently felt Thus by
the united love and example of the parents were the affections of the
children directed to a risen Saviour and it is the aim of this volume
to show principally from records penned by her own hand how one
beloved daughter grew in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord until
it pleased Him to take her to Himself
Eliza Southall possessed a mind of no common order and hers was
a character in which simplicity and strength originality and
refinement were beautifully blended diffident and retiring she was
best appreciated where she was known most intimately
In very early life she manifested an unusual degree of mental power
When quite a little child her earnest pursuit of knowledge was
remarkable she delighted in her lessons and chose for her own
reading a class of books far beyond the common taste of children
Her ardent impulsive nature was to a beautiful degree tempered and
softened by a depth of tenderness and intensity of feeling together
with a warmth of affection which bound her very closely in sympathy
even as a child with those around her
These sweet traits of natural character were so early blended with the
unmistakable evidences of the fruit of divine grace in her heart that
it would be difficult to point to any time in her earliest childhood
when there was not an earnest strife against evil some sweet proof of
the power of overcoming grace and some manifestation of love to her
Saviour
Her own words sweetly describe her feelings in recalling this
periodWhen I look back to the years of my early childhood I
cannot remember the time when the Lord did not strive with me neither
can I remember any precise time of my first covenant It was the
gentle drawing of the cords of his love it was the sweet impress of
his hand it was the breathing in silence of a wind that bloweth where
it listeth
The following instances of the serious thoughtfulness of her early
childhood are fresh in her mothers recollection On one of her
sisters first going to meeting Eliza who was younger much wished
to accompany her saying I know mamma that R and I can have
meetings at home but I do want to go Being told that her going must
depend upon her sisters behavior Eliza ran to her and putting her
arms round her neck said most earnestly Do dear R be a good
girl and behave well The dear childs desire to attend meeting was
soon gratified and that morning she selected to commit to memory
Jane Taylors appropriate hymn on attending public worship especially
noticing the stanza
The triflers too His eye can see
Who only seem to take a part
They move the lip and bend the knee
But do not seek Him with the heart
saying earnestly Oh I hope I shall not be like those
At another time whilst amusing herself with her toys she asked
Mamma what is it that makes me feel so sorry when I have done
wrong Directly mamma what is it On her mothers explaining that
it was the Holy Spirit put into her heart by her heavenly Father she
replied But how very whispering it is mamma Nobody else can hear
it Yes my dear said her mother and thou mayst sometimes hear
it compared to a still small voice and then thou wilt know what
is meant She answered Yes mamma and then continued to amuse
herself as before
The first remembrance of Eliza retained by one of her younger sisters
is that of sitting opposite to her in the nurserywindow while she
endeavored in a simple manner to explain to her the source and
object of her being To the same sister she afterwards addressed
some affectionate lines of infantile poetry urging the same subject
commencing
Look precious child to Jesus Christ
The missionary spirit which filled her young heart was also evinced
by her desire to possess a donkey that she might distribute Bibles in
the country places round about and this was afterwards spoken of as
the ambition of her childhood
Together with the cheerful sweetness of her disposition there was
an unusual pensiveness a tender care for others which was most
endearing and often touching to witness One day perceiving her
mother much affected on receiving intelligence of the decease of a
valued friend and minister at a distance from home Eliza evinced her
sympathy by laying on the table before her some beautiful lines on
the death of Howard On her mother asking if she thought the cases
similar she said Not quite mamma J T was not without
friends
So earnest was her anxiety for the good of herself and her sisters
that when any thing wrong had been done her feelings of distress
seemed equally excited whether for their sakes or her own After
any little trouble of this sort her mother often observed her
retire alone and when she returned to the familygroup a beaming
expression on her countenance would show where she had laid her
sorrows Sometimes in her playhours she would endeavor to prepare
her two younger sisters for the lessons which they would receive from
their father and when the time came for her to join in giving them
regular instruction she entered into it with zest and interest
Many hours were spent during the summer in the little plots of ground
allotted to herself and sisters out of a small plantation skirting
a meadow near the house and many others in reading under the old
elmtrees which cast their shade over the gardenwalk
The spare moments during her domestic occupations which she was
anxious not to neglect were often beguiled by learning pieces of
poetry a book being generally open at her side while thus employed
Earnestness of purpose and unwearied energy were characteristics
of her mind Whatever she undertook was done thoroughly and with
an untiring industry which often claimed the watchful care of her
parents from the fear lest she should overtax her strength It was
evidently difficult to her to avoid an unsuitable strain on her
physical powers whatever might be the nature of her pursuitwhether
her own private reading or other intellectual occupation At one
period her time and energies were closely occupied for some months
in the formation of very elaborate charts by which she endeavored to
impress historical and scientific subjects on her mind The collection
and examination of objects illustrating the different branches
of natural history was also a very favorite pursuit in which she
delighted to join her sisters But the reader will best understand how
completely any pursuit in which she became deeply interested took hold
upon her from her own account of her experiences respecting poetry
While deeply feeling her responsibility for the right use of all
the talents intrusted to her care and earnestly engaged in their
cultivation she was equally conscious of the claims of social duty
and as solicitous to fulfil them seeking in every way to contribute
to the happiness of those around her whether among the poor or among
the friends and relatives of her own circle
Her journal while it exhibits an intense earnestness in analyzing the
state of her own mind and perhaps rather too much proneness to dwell
morbidly upon it also evinces the tender joy and peace with which she
was often blessed by the manifested presence of her Lord It unfolds
an advancement in Christian experience to which her conduct bore
living testimony and proves that in humble reliance on the hope set
before her in the gospel with growing distrust of herself her faith
increased in God her Saviour and through his grace she was enabled
to maintain the struggle with her souls enemies following on to know
the Lord
Thus it was as she sought preparation for a more enlarged sphere of
usefulness on earth her spirit ripened for the perfect service of
heaven and six weeks after she left her fathers house a bride the
summons was received to join that countless multitude who have washed
their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb therefore
are they before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his
temple
DIARY
The diary which was kept by the beloved object of this memoir and
the extracts from which form the principal part of this volume is
contained in several volumes of closelywritten manuscript and
taken as a whole is a most interesting record of mental and spiritual
growth At times it was continued with almost daily regularity but
at others either from the pressure of occupations or from various
causes considerable intervals occur in which nothing was written
It has been the endeavor of the editor to make such selections as may
preserve a faithful picture of the whole There is almost of necessity
a certain amount of repetition as in seasons of depression when
faith and hope seemed to be much obscured or on the other hand when
cheerful thankfulness and joy of heart were her portion and in such
places it did not seem right to curtail her words too much Many
entries referred too closely to personal and family matters to be
suitable for publication and the uneventful character of her life
does not leave room to supply in their stead much in the way of
narrative but it will be remembered that it is the heavenward journey
that it is desired to trace not simply towards the land very
far off but that pilgrimage during which though on earth the
believer in Jesus is at times privileged to partake of the joys of
heaven
The first volume of the series is entitled by its author Mementos
of Mercy to the Chief of Sinners Some lines written on her
fourteenth birthdayabout the period of its commencementmay
appropriately introduce the extracts
6th Mo 9th 1837
Can it be true that one more link
In that mysterious chain
Which joins the two eternities
I shall not see again
Eternity that awful thing
Thought tries in vain to scan
How far beyond the loftiest powers
Of little finite man
Een daring fancys fearless flight
In vain would grasp the whole
And then How short mans mortal life
Exclaims the wondering soul
A bubble on the oceans breast
A glowworms feeble ray
That loses all its brilliancy
Beneath the orb of day
Can it be joyful then to find
That life is hastening fast
Can it be joyful to reflect
This year may be our last
Look on the firmament above
From south to northern pole
Can we find there a restingplace
For the immortal soul
Where can we search to find its home
The still small voice in thee
Answers as from the eternal throne
My own shall dwell with me
And I have one year less to seek
An interest on high
Am one year nearer to the time
When I myself must die
And when that awful time will come
No human tongue can say
But oh how startling is the thought
That it may be today
How shall my guilty spirit meet
The great allsearching eye
Conscious of my deficiencies
As in the dust I lie
How shall I join the ransomd throng
Around the throne that stand
And cast their crowns before thy feet
Lord of the saintly band
12th Mo 6th 1836 There are seasons in which
I am favored to feel a quiet resignation to spend
and be spent in the service of Him who even in
my youthful days has been pleased to visit me with
the overshadowing of His mercy and love and to require
me to give up all my dearest secret idols and
every thing which exalts self against the government
of the Prince of Peace
4th Mo 3d 1837 Almost in despair of ever
being what I ought to be I feel so poor in every
good thing and so amazingly rich in every bad thing
Still this little spark of love that remains seems to
hope in Him who will not quench the smoking flax
6th Mo 4th I have cause to be very watchful
Satan is at hand temptations abound and it is no
easy matter to keep in the right way To have my
affections crucified to the world is my desire The
way to the celestial city is not only through the
valley of humiliation but also through the valley
of the shadow of death
6th Mo 11th Many things have lately occurred
which have flattered my vanity I have received
compliments and commendations old Adam likes
these things and persuades me that I am somebody
and may well feel complacency How needful is
watchfulness may the true light discover to me the
snares that are set on every side
7th Mo 2d May I be enabled to give myself up
as clay into the Potters hand without mixing up
any thing of my own contriving and in the silence
of all flesh wait to have the true seed watered and
nourished by heavenly dew
8th Mo 2d I feel humbled at the sight of my
many backslidings and deficiencies Oh may He
who is touched with a feeling of our infirmities in
just judgment remember mercy If He does not
there can be no hope for me but oh I trust He
will Let not Thy hand spare nor Thine eye pity
till Thou hast made me what thou wouldst have me
to be
8th Mo 20th Utterly unworthy Oh my
Father if there be any right beginning if there
be the least spark of good within me carry it on
oh increase it that I may become as a plant of thy
right hand planting that I may become a sheep of
thy fold Assist me to present myself before thee
in true silence that I may wait upon thee in truth
and worship thee in the silence of all flesh and
know all my treasure all my springs in Thee
10th Mo 13th We have just been favored with
a visit from JP which has been to me a great
comfort At our Monthly Meeting he addressed
the young and it seemed as though he spoke the
very thoughts of my heart and the sweet supplication
offered on their behalf that they might be
preserved from the snares of the delusive world
may it be answered
4th Mo 15th 1838 I want to give up every
thing every thought every affection in short my
whole self to my offered Saviour Then would His
kingdom come and His will be done Instead of
the thorn would come up the firtree and instead
of the brier the myrtletree How precious how
holy how peaceful that kingdom Oh if I may
yet hope if mercy is left I beseech Thee hear and
behold me and bring me out of the miry clay and
set my feet upon the rock
5th Mo 26th 1839 A beautiful Firstday
Every thing sweet and lovely fulfilling the purpose
of its creation as far as man is not concerned Birds
and insects formed for happiness are now completely
happy But ah they were formed to give glory to
God by testifying to man His goodness Ten thousand
voices call upon me to employ the nobler
talents intrusted for the same purpose Nearly
sixteen years have I been warned and sweetly
called upon to awake out of sleep What meanest
thou O sleeper arise and call upon thy God
How shall I account in the last day for these
things It is often startling to think how time is
advancing and how ill the days work keeps pace
with the day For even now poor drowsy creature
that I am it is but occasional sensibility with the
intervals buried in vain dreams and even at such
times my poor warped affections and busy imaginations
crowded with a multitude of images refuse to
yield to the command Be still and know that I
am God I have indeed found that in whatever
circumstances I may he placed I can never be really
happy without the religion of the heart without
making the Lord my habitation and oh may it be
mine through Christs humbling and sanctifying
operations to know every corner of my heart made
fit for the dwellingplace of Him who is with the
meek and contrite ones Then shall the remaining
days of my pilgrimage be occupied in the energetic
employment of those talents which must otherwise
rise up for my condemnation in the last day
6th Mo 2d It is not for me to say any more
thus far will I go but no farther either in the
narrow or the broad way In the former we cannot
refuse to proceed without receding in the latter if
we will take any steps it is impossible to restrain
ourselves Besetting sins though apparently opposite
ones sad stumblingblocks in the way of the
cross are unrestrained activity of thought and
indolence the former proceeds from earthlymindedness
and the latter as a sure consequence from
the want of heavenlymindedness Oh that by
keeping very close to Jesus my wandering heart
may receive the impression of His hand that the
new creation may indeed be witnessed wherein
Jerusalem is a rejoicing and her people a joy
then may I find that quiet habitation which nothing
ever gave me out of the fold of Christ
6th Mo 9th Alas how shall I account for the
sixteen years which have this day completed
their course upon my head What shall I render
unto the Lord for all his benefits Shall I not
from this time cry unto Him My Father thou
art the guide of my youth But for the year that
is passed what can I say I will lay my hand on
my mouth and acknowledge that it has been squandered
Yes so far as it has not been employed about
my Fathers business But alas it has been
crammed with selfishness though now and then
He whom I trust I yet desire to serve has made me
sensibly feel how precious is every small dedication
to Himself
6th Mo 16th The consideration of the peculiar
doctrines of Friends having been lately rather
forced on my attention let me record my increased
conviction of the privilege of an education within
the borders of the Society of the great value and
importance of its spiritual profession and the awful
responsibility of its members to walk so as to adorn
its doctrines and shine as lights in the world
Warmly as she was attached to these principles she ever rejoiced in
the conviction that all the followers of Christ are one in Him and
that by whatever name designated those who have attained to the
closest communion with Him are the nearest to one another and when
differences in sentiment were the topic of conversation she would
sometimes rejoin in an earnest tone the commandment is exceeding
broad
2d Mo 2d 1840 Time passes on and what progress
do I make either in usefulness in the earth
or preparation for heaven Selfindulgence is the
bane of godliness and is alas mine This worlds
goods are snares and are alas snares to me
Coward that my heart is when pride is piqued I
have not resolution to conquer my own spirit
Pride indolence and worldlymindedness are bringing
me into closer and closer bondage the first
keeps me from true worship by preventing me from
seeking the help and teaching of the one Spirit
the second by making me yield without effort or
resistance to the uncontrolled imaginations which
the third presents And now do these lines witness
that having been called to an everlasting salvation
God the chief good having manifested His name
unto the least of His little ones my soul and body
are for Him belong to Him to be moulded and
fashioned according to His will and that if I
frustrate His purpose His glorious holiness and
free grace are unsullied and everlastingly worthy
7th Mo 12th If I acknowledge my own state
it is one cumbered with many things Alas
amid them how little space is there for the love of
God I have remembered the days when untold
and inexpressible experiences were mine when a
childs tears and prayers were seen and heard before
the throne The stragglings of grace and nature
have been great since then I can look back to
years of struggles and deliverances years of revoltings
and of mercies It is like threshing mountains
to meddle with the strongholds of sin but
mountains I sometimes hope will be made to skip
like rams
10th Mo 5th How long have I been like the
merchantman seeking goodly pearls Ever since
reason dawned I have longed for a goodly pearl
though dazzled and deceived by many an empty
trifle I cannot plead as an excuse that I could not
find the pearl I have seen it at times and felt how
untold was the price and thought I was ready to
sell all and buy it sometimes believed that all was
sold but why ah why was my pledge so often
redeemed I have been indeed like a simple one
who having found a pearl of great price cast it
from him for an empty unsatisfying show
1st Mo 17th 1841 Very precious as have been
the privileges vouchsafed the last two days I can
this morning speak of nothing as my present condition
but the extreme of weakness and poverty On
6th day evening RB addressed us in such a way
as proved to me that the Divine word is a discerner
of the thoughts and intents of the heart The
chief purport was the necessity of a willingness to
learn daily of the great Teacher meekness and
lowliness and faithfulness in the occupation of the
talents intrusted for where much is given much
will be required Yesterday his parting salutation
of brotherly love was such as cannot be effaced
from my memory and oh I pray that it may not
from my heart And now my prayer my desire
must be for a renewed dedication The separation
as RB said from the right hand and the right eye
must be made the sacrifice which is acceptable will
always cost something
3d Mo 8th Oh may I become altogether a babe
and a fool before myself and if it must be before
others God has been very graciously dealing with
me
3d Mo 19th Words must be much more
guarded as well as thoughts This morning I am
comforted with a precious feeling I will take care
of thee
3d Mo 27th How does my heart long this
evening that the one Saviour may be made unto
me wisdom and righteousness sanctification and
redemption Teach me to keep silence O God
to mind my own business and be faithful to it to
deny my own will and wisdom give me the spirit
of true Christian love that my whole life may be in
the atmosphere of love
3d Mo 28th    To cease from my own
works surely in a very small degree I can experimentally
say this is the only true rest This
blessed experience seems to me the height of enjoyment
to the truly redeemed Oh a little foretaste
of this sabbath has been granted when I have
seemed to behold with my own eye and to feel for
myself in moments too precious to be forgotten the
