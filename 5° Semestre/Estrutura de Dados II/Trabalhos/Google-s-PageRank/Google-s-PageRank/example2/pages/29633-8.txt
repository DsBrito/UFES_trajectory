1 From 1870 through 1907 Bessemer production accounted for
not less than 50 percent of United States steel production From
1880 through 1895 80 percent of all steel came from this source

The process consists in forcing through molten cast iron held in a
vessel called a converter a stream of cold air under pressure The
combination of the oxygen in the air with the silicon and carbon in the
metal raises the temperature of the latter in a spectacular way and
after blowing for a certain period eliminates the carbon from the
metal Since steel of various qualities demands the inclusion of from
015 to 170 percent of carbon the blow has to be terminated before
the elimination of the whole carbon content or if the carbon content
has been eliminated the appropriate percentage of carbon has to be put
back This latter operation is carried out by adding a precise quantity
of manganiferous pigiron spiegeleisen or ferromanganese the
manganese serving to remove the oxygen which has combined with the
iron during the blow
The controversy which surrounded its development concerned two aspects
of the process The use of the cold air blast to raise the temperature
of the molten metal and the application of manganese to overcome the
problem of control of the carbon and oxygen content
Bessemer who began his experiments in the making of iron and steel in
1854 secured his first patent in Great Britain in January 1855 and
was persuaded to present information about his discovery to a meeting
of the British Association for the Advancement of Science held at
Cheltenham Gloucestershire in August 1856 His title The Manufacture
of Iron without Fuel was given wide publicity in Great Britain and in
the United States Among those who wrote to the papers to contest
Bessemers theories were several claimants to priority of invention
Two men claimed that they had anticipated Bessemer in the invention of
a method of treating molten metal with airblasts for the purpose of
purifying or decarbonizing iron Both were Americans Joseph Gilbert
Martien of Newark New Jersey who at the time of Bessemers address
was working at the plant of the Ebbw Vale Iron Works in South Wales
secured a provisional patent a few days before Bessemer obtained one of
his series of patents for making cast steel a circumstance which
provided ammunition for those who wished to dispute Bessemers somewhat
spectacular claims William Kelly an ironmaster of Eddyville
Kentucky brought into action by an American report of Bessemers
British Association paper opposed the granting of a United States
patent to Bessemer and substantiated to the satisfaction of the
Commissioner of Patents his claim to priority in the air boiling
process
A third man this one a Scot resident in England intervened to claim
that he had devised the means whereby Martiens and Bessemers ideas
could be made practical He was Robert Mushet of Coleford
Gloucestershire a metallurgist and selfappointed sage of the
British iron and steel industry who also was associated with the Ebbw
Vale Iron Works as a consultant He like his American contemporaries
has become established in the public mind as one upon whom Henry
Bessemer was dependent for the origin and success of his process Since
Bessemer was the only one of the group to make money from the expansion
of the steel industry consequent upon the introduction of the new
technique the suspicion has remained that he exploited the inventions
of the others if indeed he did not steal them
In this study based largely upon the contemporary discussion in the
technical press the relation of the four men to each other is
reexamined and an attempt is made to place the controversy of
18551865 in focus The necessity for a reappraisal arises from the
fact that todays references to the origin of Bessemer steel2 often
contain chronological and other inaccuracies arising in many cases from
a dependence on secondary and sometimes unreliable sources As a
result Kellys contribution has perhaps been overemphasized with
the effect of derogating from the work of another American Alexander
Lyman Holley who more than any man is entitled to credit for
establishing Bessemer steel in America3
2 See especially material distributed by the American Iron and
Steel Institute in connection with its celebration of the
centennial of Steel Steel centennial 1957 press
information prepared by Hill and Knowlton Inc and released
by the Institute as of May 1 1957
3 Holleys work is outside the scope of this paper Belatedly
his biography is now being written It can hardly fail to
substantiate the contention that during his short life
18321882 Holley who negotiated the purchase of the American
rights to Bessemers process also adapted his methods to the
American scene and laid a substantial part of the foundation for
the modern American steel industry
Steel Before the 1850s
In spite of a rapid increase in the use of machines and the
overwhelming demand for iron products for the expanding railroads the
use of steel had expanded little prior to 1855 The methods of
production were still largely those of a century earlier Slow
preparation of the steel by cementation or in crucibles meant a
disproportionate consumption of fuel and a resulting high cost
Production in small quantities prevented the adoption of steel in uses
which required large initial masses of metal Steel was in fact a
luxury product
The work of Reaumur and especially of Huntsman whose development of
cast steel after 1740 secured an international reputation for
Sheffield had established the cementation and crucible processes as
the primary source of cast steel for nearly 100 years Josiah Marshall
Heaths patents of 1839 were the first developments in the direction
of cheaper steel his process leading to a reduction of from 30 to 40
percent in the price of good steel in the Sheffield market4 Heaths
secret was the addition to the charge of from 1 to 3 percent of
carburet of manganese5 as a deoxidizer Heaths failure to word his
patent so as to cover also his method of producing carburet of
manganese led to the effective breakdown of that patent and to the
general adoption of his process without payment of license or royalty
In spite of this reduction in the cost of its production steel
remained until after the midpoint of the century an insignificant
item in the output of the iron and steel industry being used
principally in the manufacture of cutlery and edge tools

York 1856 p 735
5 See abridgement of British patent 8021 of 1839 quoted by
James S Jeans Steel London 1880 p 28 ff It is not clear
that Heath was aware of the precise chemical effect of the use of
manganese in this way
The stimulus towards new methods of making steel and indeed of making
new steels came curiously enough from outside the established industry
from a man who was not an ironmasterHenry Bessemer The way in which
Bessemer challenged the trade was itself unusual There are few cases
in which a stranger to an industry has taken the risk of giving a
description of a new process in a public forum like a meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science He challenged the
trade not only to attack his theories but to produce evidence from
their own plants that they could provide an alternative means of
satisfying an emergent demand Whether or not Bessemer is entitled to
claim priority of invention one can but agree with the ironmaster who
said6 Mr Bessemer has raised such a spirit of enquiry throughout
the land as must lead to an improved system of manufacture

Bessemer and his Competitors
Henry Bessemer 18131898 an Englishman of French extraction was the
son of a mechanical engineer with a special interest in metallurgy His
environment and his unusual ability to synthesize his observation and
experience enabled Bessemer to begin a career of invention by
registering his first patent at the age of 25 His active experimenting
continued until his death although the public record of his results
ended with a patent issued on the day before his seventieth birthday A
total of 117 British patents7 bear his name not all of them by any
means successful in the sense of producing a substantial income
Curiously Bessemers financial stability was assured by the success of
an invention he did not patent This was a process of making bronze
powder and gold paint until the 1830s a secret held in Germany
Bessemers substitute for an expensive imported product in the then
state of the patent laws would have failed to give him an adequate
reward if he had been unable to keep his process secret To assure this
reward he had to design assemble and organize a plant capable of
operation with a minimum of hired labor and with close security
control The fact that he kept the method secret for 40 years suggests
that his machinery8 Bessemer describes it as virtually automatic in
operation represented an appreciation of coordinated design greatly in
advance of his time His experience must have directly contributed to
his conception of his steel process not as a metallurgical trick but as
an industrial process for when the time came Bessemer patented his
discovery as a process rather than as a formula
7 Sir Henry Bessemer FRS an autobiography London 1905
p 332
8 Ibid p 59 ff
In the light of subsequent developments it is necessary to consider
Bessemers attitude toward the patent privilege He describes his
secret gold paint as an example of what the public has had to pay for
not being able to give  security to the inventor in a situation
where the production of the material could not be identified as having
been made by any particular form of mechanism9 The inability to
obtain a patent over the method of production meant that the disclosure
of his formula necessary for patent specification would openly invite
competitors including the Germans to evolve their own techniques
Bessemer concludes10
Had the invention been patented it would have become public
property in fourteen years from the date of the patent after which
period the public would have been able to buy bronze powder at its
present ie ca 1890 market price viz from two shillings
and three pence to two shillings and nine pence per pound But this
important secret was kept for about thirtyfive years and the
public had to pay excessively high prices for twentyone years
longer than they would have done had the invention become public
property in fourteen years as it would have been if patented Even
this does not represent all the disadvantages resulting from secret
manufacture While every detail of production was a profound
secret there were no improvements made by the outside public in
any one of the machines employed during the whole thirtyfive
years whereas during the fourteen years if the invention had been
patented there would in all probability have been many improved
machines invented and many novel features applied to totally
different manufactures

10 Ibid p 83
While these words to some extent were the rationalizations of an old
man Bessemers career showed that his philosophy had a practical
foundation and if this was indeed his belief the episode explains in
large measure Bessemers later insistence on the legal niceties of the
patent procedure The effect of this will be seen
Bessemers intervention in the field of iron and steel was preceded by
a period of experiments in the manufacture of glass Here Bessemer
claims to have made glass for the first time in the open hearth of a
reverberatory furnace11 His work in glass manufacture at least gave
him considerable experience in the problems of fusion under high
temperatures and provided some support for his later claim that in
applying the reverberatory furnace to the manufacture of malleable iron
as described in his first patent of January 1855 he had in some manner
anticipated the work of C W Siemens and Emil Martin12
11 Ibid p 108 ff
12 Ibid p 141 Bessemers assertion that he had approached
within measurable distance of anticipating the SiemensMartin
process made in a paper presented at a meeting of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers Transactions of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers 1897 vol 28 p 459 evoked
strong criticism of Bessemers lack of generosity ibid p
482 One commentator friendly to Bessemer put it that
Bessemers relation to the openhearth process was very much
like Kellys to the Bessemer process Although he was
measurably near to the openhearth process he did not follow it
up and make it a commercial success ibid p 491
The general interest in problems of ordnance and armor stimulated by
the Crimean War 18541856 was shared by Bessemer whose ingenuity
soon produced a design for a projectile which could provide its own
rotation when fired from a smoothbore gun13 Bessemers failure to
interest the British War Office in the idea led him to submit his
design to the Emperor Napoleon III Trials made with the encouragement
of the Emperor showed the inadequacy of the castiron guns of the
period to deal with the heavier shot and Bessemer was presented with a
new problem which with the open mind which derived from a limited
knowledge of the metallurgy of war he attacked with impetuosity
Within three weeks of his experiments in France he had applied for a
patent for Improvements in the Manufacture of Iron and Steel14
This covered the fusion of steel with pig or cast iron and though this
must be regarded as only the first practical step toward the Bessemer
process15 it was his experiments with the furnace which provided
Bessemer with the idea for his later developments

Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers

These were described in his patent dated October 17 1855 British
patent 2321 This patent is significant to the present study because
his application for an American patent based on similar
specifications led to the interference of William Kelly and to the
subsequent denial of the American patent16 In British patent 2321
Bessemer proposed to convert his steel in crucibles arranged in a
suitable furnace and each having a vertical tuyere through which air
under pressure was forced through the molten metal As Dredge17
points out Bessemers association of the air blast with the increase
in the temperature of the metal showed his appreciation of the end in
view and the general way of attaining it though his mechanical
details were still crude and imperfect

dated April 13 1857 in Kelly vs Bessemer Interference This is

Illustration Figure 1BESSEMERS DESIGN FOR A CONVERTER AS SHOWN
IN US PATENT 16082 This patent dated November 11 1856 corresponds
with British patent 356 dated February 12 1856 The more familiar
design of converter appeared first in British patent 578 March 1
1860 The contrast with Kellys schematic drawing in Fig 2 p 42 is
noticeable
Experiments were continued and several more British patents were
applied for before Bessemer made his appearance before the British
Association on August 13 185618 Bessemer described his first
converter and its operation in some detail Although he was soon to
realize that he too readily allowed myself to bring my inventions
under public notice19 Bessemer had now thrown out a challenge which
eventually had to be taken up regardless of the strength of the vested
interests involved The provocation came from his claims that the
product of the first stage of the conversion was the equivalent of
charcoal iron the processes following the smelting being conducted
without contact with or the use of any mineral fuel and that further
blowing could be used to produce any quality of metal that is a steel
with any desired percentage of carbon Yet the principal irritant to
the complacency of the ironmaster must have been Bessemers attack on
an industry which had gone on increasing the size of its smelting
furnaces thus improving the uniformity of its pigiron without
modifying the puddling process which at best could handle no more than
400 to 500 pounds of iron at a time divided into the homeopathic
doses of 70 or 80 pounds capable of being handled by human labor20
Bessemers claim to do 800 pounds of metal in 30 minutes against the
puddling furnaces output of 500 pounds in two hours was calculated to
arouse the opposition of those who feared the loss of capital invested
in puddling furnaces and of those who suspected that their jobs might
be in jeopardy The ensuing criticism of Bessemer has to be
interpreted therefore with this in mind not by any means was it
entirely based on objective consideration of the method or the
product21
18 Bessemers paper was reported in The Times London August
14 1856 By the time the Transactions of the British Association
were prepared for publication the controversy aroused by
Bessemers claim to manufacture malleable iron and steel without
fuel had broken out and it was decided not to report the paper
Dredge op cit footnote 15 p 915 describes this decision
as sagacious

21 David Mushet recognized that Bessemers great feature was
this effort to raise the after processes  to a level
commensurate with the preceding case Mining Journal 1856 p
599
Within a month of his address Bessemer had sold licenses to several
ironmasters outside Sheffield and so provided himself with capital
with which to continue his development work but he refused to sell his
patents outright to the Ebbw Vale Iron Works and by this action as
will be seen he created an enemy for himself
The three years between 1856 and 1859 when Bessemer opened his own
steel works in Sheffield were occupied in tracing the causes of his
initial difficulties There was continued controversy in the technical
press Bessemer unless he used a nomdeplume took no part in it
and remained silent until he made another public appearance before the
Institution of Civil Engineers in London May 1859 By this time
Bessemers process was accepted as a practical one and the claims of
Robert Mushet to share in his achievement was becoming clamorous
Robert Mushet
Robert Forester Mushet 18111891 born in the Forest of Dean
Gloucestershire of a Scots father David 17721847 himself a noted
contributor to the metallurgy of iron and steel is like the American
William Kelly considered by many to have been a victim of Bessemers
astutenessor villainy Because of Robert Mushets preference for the
quiet of Coleford many important facts about his career are lacking
but even if his physical life was that of a recluse his frequent and
verbose contributions to the correspondence columns of the technical
press made him wellknown to the iron trade It is from these letters
that he must be judged
In view of his propensity to intervene pontifically in every discussion
concerning the manufacture of iron and steel it is somewhat surprising
that he refrained from comment on Bessemers British Association
address of August 1856 for more than fourteen months The debate was
opened over the signature of his brother David who shared the family
facility with the pen22 Recognizing Bessemers invention as a
congruous appendage to the now highly developed powers of the blast
furnace which he describes as too convenient too powerful and too
capable of further development to be superseded by any retrograde
process David Mushet greeted Bessemers discovery as one of the
greatest operations ever devised in metallurgy23 A month later
however David Mushet had so modified his opinion of Bessemer as to
come to the conclusion that the latter must indeed be classed with the
most unfortunate inventors He gave as his reason for this turnabout
his discovery that Joseph Martien had demonstrated his process of
purifying metal successfully and had indeed been granted a
provisional patent a month before Bessemer The sharp practice of
Martiens patent lawyer Mushet claimed had deprived him of an
opportunity of proving priority of invention against Bessemer Mushet
was convinced that Martiens was the first in the field24
22 See Mining Journal 1857 vol 27 pp 839 and 855 David
Mushet withdrew from the discussion after 1858 and his relapse
into obscurity is only broken by an appeal for funds for the
family of Henry Cort A biographer of the Mushets is of the
opinion that Robert Mushet wrote these letters and obtained
Davids signature to them Fred M Osborn The story of the
Mushets London 1952 p 44 footnote The similarity in the
style of the two brothers is extraordinary enough to support this
idea If this is so Robert Mushet who disagreed with himself as
Sideros was also in controversy with himself writing as
David
23 Mining Journal 1856 vol 26 p 567
24 Ibid pp 631 and 647 The case of Martien will be
discussed below p 36 David Mushet had overlooked Bessemers
patent of January 10 1855
Robert Mushets campaign on behalf of his own claims to have made the
Bessemer process effective was introduced in October 1857 two years
after the beginning of Bessemers experiment and after one year of
silence on Bessemers part Writing as Sideros25 he gave credit to
Martien for the great discovery that pigiron can whilst in the fluid
state be purified  by forcing currents of air under it  though
Martien had failed to observe the use of temperature by the deflation
of the iron itself and for discovering that
when the carbon has been all or nearly all dissipated the
temperature increases to an almost inconceivable extent so that
the mass when containing only as much carbon as is requisite to
constitute with it cast steel  still retains a perfect degree of
fluidity
25 Mining Journal 1857 vol 27 p 723 Robert Mushet was a
constant correspondent of the Mining Journal from 1848 The
adoption of a pseudonym peculiar apparently to 18571858 see
Dictionary of national biography vol 39 p 429 enabled him
to carry on two debates at a time and also to sing his own
praises
This says Sideros was no new observation it had been before the
metallurgical world both practical and scientific for centuries but
Bessemer was the first to show that this generation of heat could be
attained by blowing cold air through the melted iron Mushet goes on to
show however that the steel thus produced by Bessemer was not
commercially valuable because the sulphur and phosphorous remained and
the dispersion of oxide of iron through the mass imported to it the
inveterate hotshort quality which no subsequent operation could
expel Sideros concludes that Bessemers discovery was at least for
a time now shelved and arrested in its progress and it had been left
to an individual of the name of Mushet to show that if fluid
metallic manganese were combined with the fluid Bessemer iron the
portion of manganese thus alloyed would unite with the oxygen of the
oxide and pass off as slag removing the hotshort quality of the iron
Robert Mushet had demonstrated his product to Sideros and had
patented his discovery though not one print literary or scientific
had condescended to notice it
Sideros viewed Mushets discovery as a spark amongst dry faggots
that will one day light up a blaze which will astonish the world when
the unfortunate inventor can no longer reap the fruits of his lifelong
toil and unflinching perseverance In an ensuing letter he26 summed
up the situation as he saw it
Nothing that Mr Mushet can hereafter invent can entitle him to the
merit of Mr Bessemers great discovery  and  nothing that Mr
Bessemer may hereafter patent can deprive Mr Robert Mushet of having
been the first to remove the obstacles to the success of Mr Bessemers
process
26 Ibid p 823 Mushets distinction between an inventor
and a patentee is indicative of the disdain of a son of David
Mushet for an amateur see also p 886
Bessemer still did not intervene in the newspaper discussion nor had
he had any serious supporters at least in the early stage27
27 One William Green had commented extensively on David
Mushets early praise of the Bessemer process and on his sudden
reversal in favor of Martien soon after Bessemers British
Association address Mechanics Magazine 1856 vol 65 p 373
ff Green wrote from Caledonian Road and the proximity to
Baxter House Bessemers London headquarters suggests the
possibility that Green was writing for Bessemer
Publication in the Mining Journal of a list of Mushets patents28
evidently in response to Sideros complaint now presented Bessemer
with notice of Robert Mushets activity even if he had not already
observed his claims as they were presented to the Patent Office
Mushet said the Mining Journal
appears to intend to carry on his researches from the point where
Mr J G Martien left off and is proceeding on the Bessemer plan
of patenting each idea as it occurs to his imaginative brain He
proposes to make both iron and steel but does not appear to have
quite decided as to the course of action  to accomplish his
object and therefore claims various processes some of which are
never likely to realize the inventors expectations although
decidedly novel whilst others are but slight modification of
inventions which have already been tried and failed
28 Mining Journal 1857 vol 27 p 764
The contemporary attitude is reflected in another comment by the
Mining Journal29
Although the application of chemical knowledge to the manufacture
of malleable iron cannot fail to produce beneficial results the
quality of the metal depends more upon the mechanical than the
chemical processes Without wishing in any way to discourage the
iron chemists we have no hesitation in giving this as our opinion
which we shall maintain until the contrary be actually proved With
regard to steel there may be a large field for chemical research
however we believe that unless the iron be of a nature adapted
for the manufacture of steel by ordinary processes the purely
chemical inventions will only give a metal of a very uniform
quality
29 Ibid p 764
Another correspondent William Green was of the opinion that Mushets
new compounds and alloys promised well as an auxiliary to the
Bessemer process but that the evil which it was intended to remove was
more visionary than real Bessemers chief difficulty was the
phosphorus not the oxide of iron as Mr Mushet assumes This
Bessemer no doubt would deal with in due course but meanwhile he did
well to concentrate his energies upon the steel operations after
which he would have time to tackle the difficulties which have so far
retarded the iron operations30
30 Ibid p 791
Mushet31 claims to have taken out his patent of September 22 1856
covering the famous triple compound after he
had fully ascertained upon the ordinary scale of manufacture that
airpurified castiron when treated as set forth in my
specifications would afford tough malleable iron  I found
however that the remelting of the coke pigiron in contact with
coke fuel hardened the iron too much and it became evident that
an airfurnace was more proper for my purpose  the
difficulties arose not from any defect in my process but were
owing to the small quantity of the metal operated upon and the
imperfect arrangement of the purifying vessel which ought to be so
constituted that it may be turned upon an axis the blast taken
off the alloy added and the steel poured out through a spout
Such a purifying vessel Mr Bessemer has delineated in one of his
patents
31 Ibid p 770 italics supplied
Mushet also claimed to have designed his own purifying and mixing
furnace of 20ton capacity which he had submitted to the Ebbw Vale
Iron Works many months ago without comment from them There is an
intriguing reference to the painful subject of two patents not
proceeded with and not discussed in the avaricious hope that the
parties connected with the patents will make me honorable amends
these patents were suppressed without my knowledge or consent Lest
his qualifications should be questioned Mushet concludes
I do not profess to be an iron chemist but I have undoubtedly made
more experiments upon the subject of iron and steel than any man
now living and I am thereby enabled to say that all I know is but
little in comparison with what has yet to be discovered
So began Mushets claim to have solved Bessemers problem a claim
which was to fill the correspondence columns of the engineering
journals for the next ten years Interpretation of this correspondence
is made difficult by our ignorance of the facts concerning the control
of Mushets patents These have to be pieced together from his
scattered references to the subject
His experiments were conducted at least nearly up to the close of the
year 1856 with the cooperation of Thomas Brown of the Ebbw Vale Iron
Works32 The price of this assistance was apparently half interest in
Mushets patents though for reasons which Mushet does not explain the
deed prepared to effect the transfer was never executed33 Mushet
continued however to regard the patents as wholly my own though at
the same time I am bound in honor to take no unfair advantage of the
nonexecution of that deed A possible explanation of this situation
may be found in Ebbw Vales activities in connection with Martien and
Bessemer as well as with an Austrian inventor Uchatius

Ebbw Vale and the Bessemer Process
After his British Association address in August 1856 Bessemer had
received applications from several ironmasters for licenses which were
issued in return for a down payment and a nominal royalty of 25 pence
per ton Among those who started negotiations was Mr Thomas Brown of
