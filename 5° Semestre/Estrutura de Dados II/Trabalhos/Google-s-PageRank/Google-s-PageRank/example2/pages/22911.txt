FOREWORD
Once upon a time as four blind men sat by the roadside they heard the
tramp of an elephants feet and said one to another Here comes an
elephant now we shall know what he is like The first blind man put
out his hand and touched the elephants broad side The second took hold
of a leg The third grasped a tusk and the fourth clutched the animals
tail
Now do you know what an elephant looks like asked a friend
Yes cried the first The elephant is broad and flat like a barn
door
What exclaimed the second The elephant is big and round like the
trunk of a tree
Not so cried the third The elephant is hard and smooth like a
polished stone
What are you all talking about cried the fourth The elephant is
just like a piece of rope
Much socalled teaching of geography leads to just such incomplete and
fantastic ideas about geographical concepts Very many children have
only vague incomplete and incorrect conceptions of the things they see
Like these physically and mentally blind men we are too often satisfied
with mere wordy descriptions of subjects when we might study the subject
at first hand if we would
This little book is intended to prevent the giving of information by
description but to suggest ways of directing attention to those things
which lie within reach of the childs senses things which he might pass
by things which are needed now to stimulate an intelligent interest in
his surroundings things which are needed later for an appreciation and
enjoyment of his study of the larger facts and concepts of geography If
the larger geographical concepts are to have accuracy and richness for
the child he must have his attention directed to his surroundings The
trite expression from the known to the unknown is good pedagogy but
there must be a known on which to build
The book is based upon the authors actual experience in the classroom
studying the children at their geography tasks It has been her
experience that the efforts of the teachers to build broad geographical
concepts were of no avail because the pupils did not have accurate
intimate knowledge of the necessary home geography upon which to build
To correct this defect she set about collecting and classifying the
necessary material With the use of this material she not only found
that the class teachers had much less difficulty in presenting the study
of the earth as a whole but that an interest beyond all expectation was
apparent in the children
The following pages are valuable more on account of the things they
suggest than for any geographical facts which they incidentally present
The book is not a textbook on geography it is a compendium of
suggestion on the study of the subject It makes little effort to
present facts but rather it tells how to gather classify and study
facts It is intended to be used with children during the age when they
especially delight in the making of collections and is intended to turn
to a definite use this childish instinct
Map study is based entirely upon the childs experiences as he makes
plans of his schoolroom schoolhouse streets and city The suggestions
regarding the study of things foreign to the child are based entirely
upon his experience in the study of the types with which he has become
familiar in his study of his surroundings

INTRODUCTION
Geographical knowledge should progress from the known to the unknown
from the familiar to the unfamiliar The world is the home of mankind
We can best understand the larger world by a preliminary consideration
of our own small intimate home We therefore begin to study geography
with an account of the childs immediate environment The school stands
for the common home of the class From the school we gradually widen out
our teaching to include the immediate neighborhood with its buildings
and finally the whole town or community
We study the various types of people whom we meet every day and the
industries in which they engage in their efforts to obtain the three
main necessities of human lifefood clothing and shelter The animals
and plants sharing the world with man and contributing to his sustenance
next focus our attention
The home neighborhood has its physiographical features distinguishing it
from other places and influencing the life of its inhabitants The land
and water divisions in the immediate environment are studied as types
while those not closely related to our home are reserved for
consideration as each one occurs in its local geographical place in the
course of study
We must know something of direction in order to conveniently locate the
streets buildings and physiographical features near our home Finally
we will try to realize the great size of the earth of which our home is
but a small portion by a consideration of the relationship of our
community to the rest of the world and to some of this worlds great
diversities
As geography is a study of cause and effect the early lessons should be
mainly oral Later in order to obtain a broad knowledge of geographical
data not one but many books should be read This little book aims to
serve as a bridge between the oral lesson and the descriptive textbook
The presentation of many questions leads the pupil to think out cause
and effect and to connect his present knowledge with the realm of the
unknown Special care has been exercised to present facts only when
facts are absolutely necessary and only after allowing the pupil the
opportunity to first exercise his own reasoning faculties in obtaining
the information
The excursion is an essential part of every geography course and every
effort should be made to use this effective means of teaching
Four types of valuable exercises may be suggested in the use of this
book
1 The pupils may read the questions orally and give the answers orally
2 They may read the questions silently answering them orally
3 They may read the questions orally and write the answers
4 Finally they may silently read the questions and write the answers
All definitions have been carefully avoided as tending to hamper the
free acquisition of ideas

CHAPTER I
OUR SCHOOL
1
What is the name of our school
Where have you seen this name
Illustration A TOWN SCHOOL
Why was this name given to our school
On what street or road does our school stand
How long have you been attending this school
See how much you have noticed as you came here each day Tell what you
can remember of the different parts of the building which can be seen
from the street or road Describe each of these parts
Walls      Roof
Windows    Chimneys
Doors      Fireescape
2
As you look at the school from the outside what materials do you see
that the builders have used Where have they needed stone slate glass
tin iron steel wood
Now let us think of the garden and playground Tell about the different
parts and the materials that have been used in making them
What great numbers of workmen were needed before a school like ours
could be built Who procured the stone and the slate Whose work was
needed to obtain the iron the steel and the tin Who made the glass
Which workmen shall we thank for the wood
Can you think how the bare lot looked before the school was built Many
men with shovels and pickaxes dug out the foundation and numbers of
horses and wagons were needed to carry out the earth Then came the
builders How were so many materials brought here
3
1 We will go outdoors together and look at the school building
2 We will stand north of the school south east and west of it Notice
the position of the parts their number shape size and color
3 As we stand at each side see whether there are any parts which you
never noticed before or any parts which we forgot to mention yesterday

Illustration
Look at this drawing of a school building and grounds It is called a
plan Before any school or church or home is built a plan must be drawn
This is to show the workmen what to do See how much of the ground is
used for the building Find the garden What are in the garden Which is
larger the garden or the playground What shape is the playground How
many doors are there to the building In how many ways can you get into
the playground
Try to draw a plan of your school building and yard showing the gates
the flagpole the drinking fountain or pump and any other parts you
think of Show which door you use most
Note to the TeacherThe pupils should draw the plan upon paper
while the teacher draws it upon the blackboard Infinite care should
be exercised to invest every line with its full meaning Upon the
proper interpretation of this first plan will depend much of the
pupils future ability to correctly read a map as the representation
of a reality
5
THE INSIDE OF THE SCHOOL
As you walk from the school door to your room what do you see Tell all
that you have noticed in the corridors on the staircases in the
cloakrooms and the classrooms

We will go on a little excursion through the school today walking along
all of the corridors and upon all of the staircases Look especially to
see anything that you never saw before and notice anything that you
forgot to mention in yesterdays description

CHAPTER II
THE STREETS AND ROADS
1
On what street or road does your school stand
On what street or road do you live
What streets or roads do you pass on your way home
What do you think is the finest street or road that you have ever seen
anywhere What makes that so good a street or road
Name a poor street or road What could be done to improve it
2
Why do cities and towns have streets and roads Where are there no
streets
Look at the country picture shown on page 19 How pretty it is When
would it be pleasant to walk there When would it not be so pleasant
Why What must be done to a road to make it into a good street Tell
what you can of the different ways of paving lighting and draining
streets and roads and of the different kinds of namesigns you have
seen
Now what can be done to make a street or road beautiful and pleasant in
warm weather
How can boys and girls help to keep the streets and roads pleasant
Here is a plan of some of the streets in a large city
Illustration PLAN OF CITY STREETS
3
Draw the shape of the school lot Now show the street or road that the
school stands upon If you live in a town draw the streets next to the
school Then draw the next streets and keep on until you have drawn the
street on which your home stands Place a little cross to show your
home With your pencil start from your house and make a dotted line to
show how you come to school
4
On your plan of the neighborhood place a circle to show the grocery
store or bakery that you pass on your way to school Make a large dot to
show the nearest store to school and with a dotted line explain how you
would go there from school if your teacher sent you to buy ink Make a
circle with a cross in it to show where there is a church a bank a
factory or any other important building near your school If there is a
railroad near show it upon your plan
Illustration A COUNTRY HOME
5
Many streets and lanes have names of trees Some have been named after
great and good men There are some streets with only numbers for names
Do you know of any streets having names of these different kinds Can
you think of any street or road that received its name for some other
reason
Get as many pictures as you can of the streets of your town or any other
town and paste them in your notebook Get some pictures of country
roads and paste them also in your notebook

6
In some towns the streets are nearly straight and cross each other like
the wires of a windowscreen In other towns the streets run off from
the centre of the town like the spokes of a wheel Some streets and
roads are very crooked
How are the streets in our town arranged Name some of our best business
streets Which streets have the finest homes in which people live Name
some streets or roads with trolley lines upon them Are our streets
paved
7
Perhaps you live in the country where there are very few streets or none
at all How different is your walk to school each day from that of the
city boy or girl In town children walk on paved streets and pass many
buildings What kind of roads do the country children walk upon What
buildings do they pass A country school
Illustration A MODERN COUNTRY SCHOOL
Do you take a pleasant road between broad fields Do you walk through
the cool shady woods Perhaps you run over a bridge with the clear brook
sparkling and babbling beneath What else do you see or hear in the
country which city folks do not know in their built up towns
CHAPTER III
THE BUILDINGS
1
What kinds of buildings do you pass on your way to school Write a list
of all the kinds that you have ever seen
Look at the pictures of buildings in this book and see if you know for
what each is used How can you tell
2
Of all the many kinds of buildings in town or country the houses are
the most important It is more necessary to have good homes to live in
than to have the other buildings large or beautiful What makes a good
residence There must be enough room for the whole family It needs
plenty of light air sunshine and water It must have a good roof to
keep it dry in stormy weather It should be well heated in the cold
winter Tell of other things that are needed in our homes to keep the
family healthy and happy How can you help to make your home pleasant
3
Good schools too are very necessary The schoolhouse must be built
to keep the boys and girls comfortable and healthy while at work Name
some of the things needed for a good school building

The libraries and museums also teach people A library is like a home
where many friendly teachers live These friends will talk to you and
tell you many useful and wonderful things Have you ever visited them at
the library Have you ever taken any of them home with you Is there a
library near our school
The museums are full of many interesting objects You may see
beautiful pictures and statuary Some have collections of pretty stones
and of stuffed animals Curious clothing jewelry toys and musical
instruments used by people in distant lands are shown too In a museum
in Portland you may see the dear little clothing worn by the poet
Longfellow when he was a tiny baby Many books that Washington read are
kept in a museum near the city of Washington Have you ever visited a
museum in a city What did you see there
5
No buildings anywhere are more beautiful than the churches Are there
any churches in your neighborhood Describe the church which you attend
6
In town and country there are many ill people who cannot be cared for at
home They go to hospitals to be nursed back to health and strength
The good doctors and nurses work day and night to cure the sick people
How can well people help sick people Where is the nearest hospital to
your home What is it named
Illustration INDEPENDENCE HALL
7
Almost every town has a Town Hall Have you ever seen such a building
What is it used for Here the mayor has his office Sometimes the Town
Hall or Court House has a high tower or a fine dome or a cupola If
you have ever seen a Town Hall tell how it looked
8
Think of the stores that you have seen How many kinds can you name
What does each sell principally Where are these things made Have you
ever seen a large factory What does it manufacture
Illustration PITTSBURGH OBSERVATORY
It would be fine if all of the buildings in which folks work were sunny
airy and clean People employed in comfortable stores and factories are
happy and feel like working
Alas there are many miserable places where the workmen are crowded and
uncomfortable The impure air makes them tired and ill If you have seen
a good store or factory tell what helps to keep the workers comfortable
and healthy
9
Old cities have in them many very old buildings that all Americans love
The magnificent Capitol at Washington was built long ago It is one of
the finest buildings in the world It is built of white marble In the
first picture in this book notice the beautiful dome and the great high
stairs In Philadelphia is the dear old Independence Hall with the
Liberty Bell Boston has the old Faneuil Hall Here many great Americans
of long ago have spoken to the people Are there any old historic
buildings in our neighborhood

Suppose some friends travel on the railroad to visit us At what
railroad station would the train arrive Are there any other stations
How are they built Do you think they give a beautiful clean friendly
welcome to strangers All stations should be pleasant and comfortable to
cheer the tired travelers that pass through them day and night At
Denver just outside of the station there is a great arch stretching
across the street It says Welcome in bright letters at night and in
pretty letters in the day The visitor is glad to see the friendly word
after a long trip

11
When friends come from another town we like to show them the sights
Plan a nice trip around the town Write a list of places to which you
would take them You must know where each place is What could you tell
about each place
12
One day we should visit some park Is there any near our school Are
there any interesting buildings or statuary in the park Is there any
water near by
When we visit our town park we should remember that it belongs to us
for a public park belongs to all of the people Do you not like to have
the things that belong to you as good as useful and as beautiful as
possible Do you want your home to look sweet and clean and comfortable
or dirty careless and unpleasant Do you want your clothing to be
strong neat and pretty or torn and dirty We should all take pride in
having the things we own just as good as possible When you are in the
street the school any public building or in a park say to yourself
This is mine Then look around and see whether you like the way it
looks Think how you can help to keep it looking well or make it look
even better
Illustration WINTER SCENE IN FAIRMOUNT PARK
How can boys and girls help keep the grass the paths the flowerbeds
the trees and the buildings beautiful Where does the money come from to
pay the caretakers of the park
Some people visit the park only in spring summer or autumn We all love
the park in those seasons Many do not know how beautiful the bare trees
look in winter with their gray or brown branches There is no more
exquisite sight in the world than to see these trees coated with
glistening ice out to the tiniest twig or to see them ridged with
pearly white snow It is a merry sight to see the jolly coasters and
skaters

Think of the times when you have walked or ridden about our town
What rivers did you see

Which buildings did you think were very beautiful
What was each used for
What buildings have we that are very helpful to the people
What interesting places have you visited in your neighborhood
What other places would you like to visit

PREPARATION FOR A TRIP TO SOME HILLTOP OBSERVATORY TOWER OR
ROOFGARDEN FROM WHICH AN EXTENSIVE VIEW CAN BE HAD
What place shall we visit Why Draw a plan to include the school and
the place to be visited
How far must we go Shall we ride or walk In what direction shall we
go
When we are up high we can look over the whole neighborhood First try
to find our school In what direction shall we need to face Then let us
notice what lies between us and our school See if you can find any park
or large building which you know Try to find the street or road upon
which your home stands Then look beyond our school for any other
familiar building or park and look for your home if you did not see it
before Notice how far the town stretches and try to see what cuts it
off or bounds it
Next we shall turn and look in the opposite direction What direction
will that be Find any familiar places How can you know which are
homes schools churches or factories See how far the town extends and
what cuts off or bounds it on this side
In what other directions shall we look Again we shall notice the
familiar and unfamiliar places and the town boundaries

Was the neighborhood view like you expected What surprised you What
did we see most of Make a list of all the places you remember seeing
Think of each view separately north south east and west Tell of
anything you saw as you looked in each direction Why could we see so
much How could we see even farther
5
Do we live in a large city a small town or in the country What is the
name of our town or the nearest town Who first settled in the place
which has grown to be a town It is hard for us to believe that two
hundred and fifty years ago there were no houses churches schools
streets or roads where we now live All this land was wild country
mostly woods The early settlers were strong and brave men They had to
cut down the forests and build their first homes of rough logs Then
they planted fields with corn wheat and vegetables They killed the
wild animals for food using the skins for clothing As soon as
possible the settlers tried to build a small plain church and a
schoolhouse

Now we have our fine towns which have grown from the early work of these
first sturdy settlers All of the people should love our dear home town
and try to make it beautiful healthful and comfortable We should love
our neighbors and treat them all like brothers and sisters If we are
true to our village or our dear town we will be kind and fair to all
rich and poor Americans and foreigners white and colored people That
is one way of showing our thankfulness for our comfortable homes
CHAPTER V
THE PEOPLE
1
Think of the many buildings which you see as you look over the
landscape There are people living in nearly all of those houses Just
think of the many many people who live here How many are there How
many schools have we in the town How many people go to your school
Most of these people look much alike but some are very different in
appearance Name some of the different kinds of people whom you have
seen How do you distinguish a negro and Chinaman or Mongolian from a
white person or Caucasian Tell about their hair skin or any other
peculiar features
Each kind of people is called a race The pictures show some of the
races we often seeCaucasian Mongolian and negro The Chinese and
Japanese are called Mongolians

THE INDIANS
The Indians lived at this place which is now our home long before there
were any white people here or any towns at all Where these many
buildings now stand there was wild country fields and woods Under the
trees stood the Indian wigwams made of skins and branches The early
settlers came to this country from far across the ocean After William
Penn landed with his companions he began at once to make friends with
the Indians As the red men were living upon the land Penn thought that
it was only fair and honest to buy from them the land that the English
people wanted for their homes The Indians could not use money so he
