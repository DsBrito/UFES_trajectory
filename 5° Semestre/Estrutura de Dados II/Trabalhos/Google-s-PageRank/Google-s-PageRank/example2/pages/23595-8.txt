Illustration ROBERT OWEN
In Germany the land of philosophy when the savants sail into a sea of
doubt some one sets up the cry Back to Kant
In America when professed democracy grows ambitious and evolves a lust
for power men say Back to Jefferson
In business when employer forgets employee and both forget their better
manhood we say Back to Robert Owen
We will not go back to Robert Owen we will go on to Robert Owen for
his philosophy is still in the vanguard
Robert Owen was a businessman His first intent was to attain a
practical success He produced the article and sold it at a profit
In this operation of taking raw material and manufacturing it into forms
of use and beautyfrom the time the seed was planted in the ground on
up to the consumer who purchased the finished fabric and wove itOwen
believed that all should profitall should be made happier by every
transaction
That is to say Robert Owen believed that a business transaction where
both sides do not make money is immoral
There is a legal maxim still cited in the courtsCaveat emptorlet
the buyer beware
For this maxim Robert Owen had no respect He scorned the thought of
selling a man something the man did not want or of selling an article
for anything except exactly what it was or of exacting a price for it
by hook or crook beyond its value
Robert Owen believed in himself and in his product and he believed in
the people He was a democratic optimist He had faith in the demos and
the reason was that his estimate of the people was formed by seeing into
his own heart He realized that he was a part of the people and he knew
that he wanted nothing for himself which the world could not have on the
same terms He looked into the calm depths of his own heart and saw that
he hated tyranny pretense vice hypocrisy extravagance and untruth
He knew in the silence of his own soul that he loved harmony health
industry reciprocity truth and helpfulness His desire was to benefit
mankind and to help himself by helping others
Therefore he concluded that the source of all life being the same he
was but a sample of the average man and all men would if not
intimidated and repressed desire what he desired
When physically depressed through lack of diversified exercise bad air
or wrong conditions he realized that his mind was apt to be at war not
only with its best self but with any person who chanced to be near
From this he argued that all departures in society were occasioned by
wrong physical conditions and in order to get a full and free
expression of the Divine Mind of which we are all reflectors or
mediums our bodies must have a right environment
To get this right environment became the chief business and study of his
life
To think that a man who always considers the other fellow should be a
great success in a business way is to us more or less of a paradox
Keep your eye on Number One we advise the youth intent on success
Take care of yourself say the bucolic Solons when we start on a
little journey And Selfpreservation is the first law of life voice
the wise ones
And yet we know that the man who thinks only of himself acquires the
distrust of the whole community He sets in motion forces that work
against him and has thereby created a handicap that blocks him at every
step
Robert Owen was one of those quiet wise men who win the confidence of
men and thereby siphon to themselves all good things That the
psychology of success should have been known to this man in Seventeen
Hundred Ninety we might call miraculous were it not for the fact that
the miraculous is always the natural
Those were troublous times when Robert Owen entered trade The French
Revolution was on and its fires lit up the intellectual sky of the
whole world The Colonies had been lost to England it was a time of
tumult in Threadneedle Street the armies of the world were lying on
their arms awaiting orders And out of this great unrest emerged Robert
Owen handsome intelligent honest filled with a holy zeal to help
himself by helping humanity
Robert Owen was born in the village of Newtown Wales in Seventeen
Hundred Seventyone After being away from his native village for many
years he returned as did Shakespeare and as have so many successful
men and again made the place of his boyhood the home of his old age
Owen died in the house in which he was born His body was buried in the
same grave where sleeps the dust of his father and his mother During
the eightyseven years of his life he accomplished many things and
taught the world lessons which it has not yet memorized
In point of time Robert Owen seems to have been the worlds first
Businessman Private business was to him a public trust He was a
creator a builder an economist an educator a humanitarian He got
his education from his work at his work and strove throughout his long
life to make it possible for others to do the same
He believed in the Divinity of Business He anticipated Emerson by
saying Commerce consists in making things for people who need them
and carrying them from where they are plentiful to where they are
wanted
Every economist should be a humanitarian and every humanitarian should
be an economist Charles Dickens writing in Eighteen Hundred Sixty
puts forth Scrooge Carker and Bumball as economists When Dickens
wanted to picture ideal businessmen he gave us the Cheeryble
brothersmen with soft hearts giving pennies to all beggars shillings
to poor widows and coal and loaves of bread to families living in
rickety tenements The Dickens idea of betterment was the priestly plan
of dole Dickens did not know that indiscriminate almsgiving pauperizes
humanity and never did he supply the world a glimpse of a man like
Robert Owen whose charity was something more than palliation
Robert Owen was born in decent poverty of parents who knew the simple
beautiful and necessary virtues of industry sobriety and economy Where
this son got his hunger for books and his restless desire for
achievement we do not know He was a business genius and from genius of
any kind no hovel is immune
He was sent to London at the age of ten to learn the saddlers trade
at twelve he graduated from making waxends blacking leather and
greasing harness and took a position as salesman in the same business
From this he was induced to become a salesman for a haberdasher He had
charm of mannerfluidity sympathy and health At seventeen he asked to
be paid a commission on sales instead of a salary and on this basis he
saved a hundred pounds in a year
At eighteen a customer told him of a wonderful inventiona machine
that was run by steamfor spinning cotton into yarn Robert was
familiar with the old process of making woolen yarn on a spinningwheel
by handhis mother did it and had taught him and his brothers and
sisters how
Cotton was just coming in since the close of George Washingtons
Rebellion Watt had watched his mothers teakettle to a good purpose
Here were two big things destined to revolutionize trade the use of
cotton in place of flax or wool and steampower instead of human
muscle Robert Owen resigned his clerkship and invested all of his
earnings in three mule spinningmachines Then he bought cotton on
credit
He learned the business and the first year made three hundred pounds
Seeing an advertisement in the paper for an experienced superintendent
of a cotton mill he followed his intuitions hunted out the advertiser
a Mr Drinkwater and asked for the place
Mr Drinkwater looked at the beardless stripling smiled and explained
that he wanted a man not a boya man who could take charge of a mill
at Manchester employing five hundred hands
Robert Owen stood his ground
What would he work for
Three hundred pounds a year
Bosh Boys of nineteen could be had for fifty pounds a year
But not boys like me said Robert Owen earnestly Then he explained
to Mr Drinkwater his positionthat he had a little mill of his own and
had made three hundred pounds the first year But he wanted to get into
a larger field with men of capital
Mr Drinkwater was interested Looking up the facts he found them to be
exactly as stated He hired the youth at his own price and also bought
all of young Mr Owens machinery and stock raw and made up
Robert Owen aged nineteen went at once to Manchester and took charge
of the mill His business was to buy and install new machinery hire all
help fix wages buy the raw material and manufacture and sell the
product
For six weeks he did not give a single order hire a new man nor
discharge an old one He silently studied the situation He worked with
the menmade friends with them and recorded memoranda of his ideas He
was the first one at the factory in the morningthe last to leave it at
night
After six weeks he began to act
The first years profit was twenty per cent on the investment against
five for the year before
Drinkwater paid him four hundred pounds instead of three and proposed
it should be five hundred for the next year A contract was drawn up
running for five years giving Owen a salary and also a percentage
after sales mounted above a certain sum
Robert Owen was now twenty years of age He was sole superintendent of
the mill The owner lived at London and had been up just oncethis
after Owen had been in his new position for three months Drinkwater saw
various improvements made in the plantthe place was orderly tidy
cleanly and the workers were not complaining although Owen was
crowding out the work
Owen was on friendly terms with his people visiting them in their
homes He had organized a dayschool for the smaller children and a
nightschool for the older ones who worked in the mills His
friendliness goodcheer and enthusiasm were contagious The place was
prosperous
Just here let us make a digression and inspect the peculiar conditions
of the time
It was a period of transitionthe old was dying the new was being
born Both experiences were painful
There was a rapid displacement of hand labor One machine did the work
of ten or more persons What were these people who were thrown out to
do Adjust themselves to the new conditions you say True but many
could not They starved grew sick ate their hearts out in useless
complaining
Only a few years before and the spinning of flax and wool was
exclusively a home industry Every cottage had its spinningwheel and
loom There was a garden a cow a pig poultry and fruits and flowers
The whole household worked and the wheel and loom were never idle while
it was light The family worked in relays
It was a very happy and prosperous time Life was simple and natural
There was constant labor but it was diversified The large flocks of
sheep raised chiefly for wool made mutton cheap Everything was
homemade People made things for themselves and if they acquired a
superior skill they supplied their neighbors or exchanged products with
them As the manufacturing was done in the homes there was no crowding
of population The factory boardinghouse and the tenement were yet to
come
This was the condition up to Seventeen Hundred Seventy From then until
Seventeen Hundred Ninety was the time of transition By Seventeen
Hundred Ninety mills were erected wherever there was waterpower and
the village artisans were moving to the towns to work in the mills
For the young men and women it was an alluring life The old way gave
them no time to themselvesthere was the cow to milk the pigs and
poultry to care for or the garden making insistent demands Now they
worked at certain hours for certain wages and rested Tenements took
the place of cottages and the public with its smiling barkeep was
always right at the corner
Hargreaves Arkwright Watt and Eli Whitney had worked a revolution more
farreaching than did Mirabeau Danton Robespierre and Marat
Here creeps in an item interesting to our friends who revel in syntax
and prosody Any machine or apparatus for lifting has been called a
jack since the days of Shakespeare The jack was the bearer of
bundles a lifter a puller a worker Any coarse bit of mechanism was
called a jack and is yet In most factories there are testingjacks
gearingjacks liftingjacks Falstaff tells of a jackofalltrades
The jack was anything strong patient and serviceable
When Hargreaves the Lancashire carpenter invented his
spinningmachine a village wit called it a jenny The machine was
fine delicate subtle and as spinning was a womans business anyway
the new machine was parsed in the feminine gender
Soon the new invention took on a heavier and stronger form and its
persistency suggested to some other merry bucolic a new variation and it
was called a mule The word stuck and the mulespinner is with us
wherever cotton is spun
The discovery that coal was valuable for fuel followed the invention of
the steamengine
When things are needed we dig down and find them or reach up and secure
them You could not run a steamship except along a river with
wellwooded banks any more than you could run an automobile with coal
The dealing in coal or coals as our English cousins still use the
word began in Eighteen Hundred Nineteen That was the year the first
steamship the Savannah crossed the ocean She ran from Savannah to
London Her time was twentyfive days She burned four hundred fifty
tons of coal or about twothirds of her entire carrying capacity
Robert Fulton had been running his steamer Clermont on the Hudson in
Eighteen Hundred Seven but there were woodingstations every twenty
miles
It was argued in the House of Commons that no steamship could ever cross
the Atlantic with steam alone as a propelling power And even as it
was being mathematically proved the whistle of the Savannah drowned
the voice of the orator
But the Savannah also carried sail and so the doubters still held the
floor An iron boat with no sails that could cross the Atlantic in five
days was a miracle that no optimist had foreseenmuch less dared
prophesy
The new conditions almost threatened to depopulate the rural districts
Farmers forsook the soil The uncertainty of a crop was replaced with
the certainty of a given wage Children could tend the spinningjennies
as well as men There was a demand for child labor Any poor man with a
big family counted himself rich Many a man who could not find a job at
a mans wage quit work and was supported by his wife and children To
rear a family became a paying enterprise
Various millowners adopted children or took them under the apprentice
system agreeing to teach them the trade Girls and boys from orphan
asylums and workhouses were secured and held as practical slaves They
were herded in sheepsheds where they slept on straw and were fed in
troughs They were worked in two shifts night and day so the straw was
never really cold They worked twelve hours slept eight and one hour
was allowed for meals Their clothing was not removed except on
Saturday Any alteration in the business life of a people is fraught
with great danger
Recklessness greed and brutality at such a time are rife
Almost all workingmen of forty or over were out of work Naturally
employers hired only the young the active the athletic These made
more money than they were used to making so they spent it lavishly and
foolishly It was a prosperous time yet strangely enough prosperity
brought starvation to thousands Family life in many instances was
destroyed and thus were built those long rows of houses all alike
with no mark of individualityno yard no flowers no gardensthat
still in places mar the landscape in factory towns
Pretty girls went to the towns to work in the mills and thus lost home
ties Later they drifted to London Drunkenness increased
In Seventeen Hundred Ninetysix there was formed the Manchester Board
of Health Its intent was to guard the interests of factoryworkers Its
desire was to insure light ventilation and sanitary conveniences for
the workers Beyond this it did not seek to go
The mill superintendents lifted a howl They talked about interference
and depriving the poor people of the right to labor They declared it
was all a private matter between themselves and the workersa matter of
contract
Robert Owen it seems was the first factory superintendent to invite
inspection of his plant He worked with the Board of Health not against
it He refused to employ children under ten years of age and although
there was a tax on windows he supplied plenty of light and also fresh
air So great was the ignorance of the workers that they regarded the
Factory Laws as an infringement on their rights The greed and foolish
fears of the millowners prompted them to put out the good old argument
that a mans children were his own and that for the State to dictate to
him where they should work when and how was a species of tyranny Work
was good for children Let them run the streets Never
It is a curious thing to note that when Senator Albert J Beveridge
endeavored to have a Federal Bill passed at Washington in Nineteen
Hundred Seven the arguments he had to meet and answer were those which
Robert Owen and Sir Robert Peel were obliged to answer in Seventeen
Hundred Ninetyfive
When a man who worked a hundred orphans fourteen hours a day boys and
girls of from six to twelve was accused of cruelty he defended himself
by saying If I doesnt work em all the time cept when they sleep and
eat they will learn to play and then never work This argument was
repeated by many fond parents as conclusive
The stress of the timeshaving many machines in one building all run
by one motor power the necessity of buying raw material in quantities
the expense of finding a marketall these combined to force the
invention of a very curious economic expediency It was called a Joint
Stock Company From a man and his wife and his children making things at
home we get two or three men going into partnership and hiring a few
of their neighbors at day wages
Then we get the system of shareholding with hundreds or thousands of
people as partners in a manufacturing enterprise which they never visit
The people who owned the shares were the ones who owned the tools Very
naturally they wanted and expected dividends for the use of the tools
That was all they wanteddividends The manager of the mill held his
position only through his ability to make the venture bring returns The
people who owned the shares or the tools never saw the people who used
the tools A great gulf lay between them For the wrongs and injustices
visited upon the workers no one person was to blame The fault was
shifted Everybody justified himself And then came the saying
Corporations have no souls
Robert Owen was manager of a mill yet he saw the misery the ignorance
and the mental indifference that resulted from the factory system He
too must produce dividends but the desire of his heart was also to
mitigate the lot of the workers
Books were written by good men picturing the evils of the factory
system Comparisons were made between the old and the new in which the
hideousness of the new was etched in biting phrase Some tried to turn
the dial backward and revive the cottage industries as did Ruskin a
little later A Dream of John Ball was anticipated and many sighed
for the good old times
But among the many philosophers and philanthropists who wrestled with
the problem Robert Owen seems to have stood alone in the belief that
success lay in going on and not in turning back He set himself to
making the new condition tolerable and prophesied a day when out of the
smoke and din of strife would emerge a condition that would make for
health happiness and prosperity such as this tired old world never has
seen Robert Owen was Englands first Socialist
Very naturally he was called a dreamer Some called him an infidel and
the enemy of society
Very many now call him a seer and a prophet
In Robert Owens day cotton yarn was packaged and sold in fivepound
bundles These packages were made up in hanks of a given number of
yards One hundred twenty counts to a package was fixed upon as par
or standard count If the thread was very fine of course more hanks
were required to make up the five pounds The price ranged up or down
below or above the onehundredtwenty mark That is if a package
contained two hundred forty hanks its value was just double what it
would have been if merely standard
Robert Owen knew fabrics before he began to spin
First he was a salesman Second he made the things he could sell
The one supremely difficult thing in business is salesmanship Goods can
be manufactured on formula but it takes a man to sell He who can sell
is a successothers may be
The only men who succeed in dictating the policy of the house are those
in the Sales Departmentthat is those who are on the side of income
not of expense
The man with a secret process of manufacture always imparts his
secret sooner or later but the salesman does not impart his secret
because he cant It is not transferable It is a matter of personality
Not only does the salesman have to know his goods but he must know the
buyerhe must know humanity
And humanity was the raw stock in which Robert Owen dealt Robert Owen
never tried to increase his sales by decreasing his price His product
was always higher than standard Anybody can cut prices he said but
it takes brains to make a better article He focused on fineness
And soon buyers were coming to him A finer article meant a finer trade
And now on each package of yarn that Owen sent out he placed a label
that read thus This package was made under the supervision of Robert
Owen Thus his name gradually became a synonym for quality
Among other curious ideas held by Owen was that to make finer goods you
must have a finer quality of workman To produce this finer type of
person now became his dream
Mr Drinkwater smiled at the idea and emphasized dividends
Now Mr Drinkwater had a soninlaw who looked in on things once a
month signed his voucher and went away foxhunting He thought he was
helping run the mill This man grew jealous of the young manager and
suggested that Drinkwater increase the boys pay and buy off the
percentage clause in the contract so as to keep the youngster from
getting megalocephalia
Drinkwater asked Owen what he would take for the contract and Owen
handed it to him and said Nothing It gave him a chance to get out
into a larger field Drinkwater never thought of the value of that
little Robert Owen label No wise employer should ever allow a thing
like that
Owen had won both name and fame among the merchants and he now engaged
with several mills to superintend their output and sell their goods with
his label on each package In other words he was a Manufacturers
Broker From a fivehundredpoundayear man he had grown to be worth
two thousand pounds a year
No mill owned him He was freehe was making money The dream of human
betterment was still in his heart
On one of his trips to Glasgow to sell goods he met a daughter of David
Dale a millowner who was in active competition with him Dale made a
fine yarn too
The girl had heard of Owen they met as enemiesa very good way to
begin an acquaintance It was Natures old old game of stamen pistil
and pollen that fertilizes the world of business betterment and
beauty They quarreled
You are the man who puts your name on the package
Yes
And yet you own no mill
Truebut
Never mind You certainly are proud of your name
I amwouldnt you be
Not of yours
Then they stared at each other in defiance To relieve the tension Mr
Owen proposed a stroll They took a walk through the park and discovered
that they both were interested in Social Reform David Dale owned the
mills at New Lanarka most picturesque site He was trying to carry on
a big business so as to make money and help the workers He was doing
neither because his investment in the plant had consumed too much of
his working capital
They discussed the issue until eleven fortyfive by the clock
The girl knew business and knew Society The latter she had no use for
The next day they met again and quite accidentally found themselves
engaged neither of em knew how
It was very embarrassing How could they break the news to Papa Dale
They devised a way It was this Robert Owen was to go and offer to buy
Mr Dales mills
Owen went over to Lanark and called on Mr Dale and told him he wanted
to buy his business Mr Dale looked at the boy and smiled Owen was
twentyseven but appeared twenty being beardless slight and
fairhaired
The youth said he could get all the money that was needed They sparred
for a timeneither side naming figures It being about noontime Mr
Dale asked young Mr Owen to go over to his house to lunch Mr Dale
was a widower but his daughter kept the house Mr Dale introduced Mr
Owen to Miss Dale
The young folks played their parts with a coolness that would have
delighted John Drew and would have been suspicious to anybody but a
fussy old millowner
Finally as the crumbs were being brushed from the rich mans table Mr
Dale fixed on the sum of sixty thousand pounds for his property
Owen was satisfied and named as terms three thousand pounds and interest
each year for twenty years touching the young ladys toe with his own
under the table
Mr Dale agreed Mr Owen had the money to make the first payment The
papers were drawn up The deal was closedall but the difficult part
This was done by rushing the enemy in his library after a good meal
It keeps the business in the family you see said the girl on her
knees pouting prettily
The point was gained and when Robert Owen a few weeks later came to
New Lanark to take possession of the property he did as much for the
girl So they were married and lived happily ever afterward
Robert Owen took up his work at New Lanark with all the enthusiasm that
hope youth and love could bring to bear
Mr Dale had carried the flag as far to the front as he thought it could
be safely carriedthat is to say as far as he was able to carry it
Owen had his work cut out for him The workers were mostly Lowland
Scotch and spoke in an almost different language from Owen They looked
upon him with suspicion The place had been sold and they had gone with
ithow were they to be treated Were wages to be lowered and hours
extended Probably
Pilfering had been reduced to a system and to get the start of the
softhearted owner was considered smart
Mr Dale had tried to have a school and to this end had hired an
elderly Irishman who gave hard lessons and a taste of the birch to
children who had exhausted themselves in the mills and had no zest for
learning Mr Dale had taken on more than two hundred pauper children
from the workhouses and these were a sore trial to him
Owens first move was to reduce the workinghours from twelve to ten
hours Indeed he was the first millowner to adopt the tenhour plan
He improved the sanitary arrangements put in showerbaths and took a
personal interest in the diet of his little wards often dining with
them
A special schoolbuilding was erected at a cost of thirty thousand
dollars This was both a day and a night school It also took children
of one year old and over in order to relieve mothers who worked in the
mills The little mothers often only four or five years old took
care of babies a year old and younger all day
Owen instructed his teachers never to scold or to punish by inflicting
physical pain His was the first school in Christendom to abolish the
rod
His plan anticipated the Kindergarten and the Creche He called mothers
meetings and tried to show the uselessness of scolding and beating
because to do these things was really to teach the children to do them
He abolished the sale of strong drink in New Lanark Model houses were
erected gardens planted and prizes given for the raising of flowers
In order not to pauperize his people Owen had them pay a slight tuition
for the care of the children and there was a small tax levied to buy
flowerseeds In the schoolbuilding was a dancehall and an auditorium
At one time the supply of raw cotton was cut off for four months During
this time Owen paid his people full wages insisted that they should
all old and young go to school for two hours a day and also work two
hours a day at treeplanting grading and gardening During this period
of idleness he paid out seven thousand pounds in wages This was done to
keep the workmen from wandering away
It need not be imagined that Owen did not have other cares besides
those of social betterment Much of the machinery in the mills was worn
and becoming obsolete To replace this he borrowed a hundred thousand
dollars Then he reorganized his business as a stock company and sold
shares to several London merchants with whom he dealt He interested
Jeremy Bentham the great jurist and humanitarian and Bentham proved
his faith by buying stock in the New Lanark Company
Joseph Lancaster the Quaker a millowner and philanthropist did the
same
Owen paid a dividend of five per cent on his shares A surplus was also
set aside to pay dividends in case of a setback but beyond this the
money was invested in bettering the environment of his people
New Lanark had been running fourteen years under Owens management It
had attracted the attention of the civilized world The Grand Duke
Nicholas afterwards the Czar spent a month with Owen studying his
methods The Dukes of Kent Sussex Bedford and Portland the Archbishop
of Canterbury the Bishops of London Peterborough and Carlisle the
Marquis of Huntly Lords Grosvenor Carnarvon Granville Westmoreland
Shaftesbury and Manners General Sir Thomas Dyce and General Brown
Ricardo De Crespigny Wilberforce Joseph Butterworth and Sir Francis
Baringall visited New Lanark Writers preachers doctors in fact
almost every man of intellect and worth in the Kingdom knew of Robert
Owen and his wonderful work at New Lanark Sir Robert Peel had been to
New Lanark and had gone back home and issued an official bulletin
inviting millowners to study and pattern after the system
The House of Commons asked Owen to appear and explain his plan for
