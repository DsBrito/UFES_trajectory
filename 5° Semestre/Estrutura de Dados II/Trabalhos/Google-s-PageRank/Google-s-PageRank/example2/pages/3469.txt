1 A STREET IN ANGLEBURYA HEATH NEAR ITINSIDE THE RED LION INN
Young Mrs Petherwin stepped from the door of an old and wellappointed
inn in a Wessex town to take a country walk  By her look and carriage
she appeared to belong to that gentle order of society which has no
worldly sorrow except when its jewellery gets stolen but as a fact not
generally known her claim to distinction was rather one of brains than
of blood  She was the daughter of a gentleman who lived in a large house
not his own and began life as a baby christened Ethelberta after an
infant of title who does not come into the story at all having merely
furnished Ethelbertas mother with a subject of contemplation  She
became teacher in a school was praised by examiners admired by
gentlemen not admired by gentlewomen was touched up with
accomplishments by masters who were coaxed into painstaking by her many
graces and entering a mansion as governess to the daughter thereof was
stealthily married by the son  He a minor like herself died from a
chill caught during the wedding tour and a few weeks later was followed
into the grave by Sir Ralph Petherwin his unforgiving father who had
bequeathed his wealth to his wife absolutely
These calamities were a sufficient reason to Lady Petherwin for pardoning
all concerned  She took by the hand the forlorn Ethelbertawho seemed
rather a detached bride than a widowand finished her education by
placing her for two or three years in a boardingschool at Bonn  Latterly
she had brought the girl to England to live under her roof as daughter
and companion the condition attached being that Ethelberta was never
openly to recognize her relations for reasons which will hereafter
appear
The elegant young lady as she had a full right to be called if she cared
for the definition arrested all the local attention when she emerged
into the summerevening light with that diademandsceptre bearingmany
people for reasons of heredity discovering such graces only in those
whose vestibules are lined with ancestral mail forgetting that a bear
may be taught to dance  While this air of hers lasted even the
inanimate objects in the street appeared to know that she was there but
from a way she had of carelessly overthrowing her dignity by versatile
moods one could not calculate upon its presence to a certainty when she
was round corners or in little lanes which demanded no repression of
animal spirits
Well to be sure exclaimed a milkman regarding her  We should freeze
in our beds if twere not for the sun and dang me if she isnt a
pretty piece  A man could make a meal between them eyes and chineh
hostler  Odd nation dang my old sides if he couldnt
The speaker who had been carrying a pair of pails on a yoke deposited
them upon the edge of the pavement in front of the inn and straightened
his back to an excruciating perpendicular  His remarks had been
addressed to a rickety person wearing a waistcoat of that preternatural
length from the top to the bottom button which prevails among men who
have to do with horses  He was sweeping straws from the carriageway
beneath the stone arch that formed a passage to the stables behind
Never mind the cursing and swearing or somebody whos never out of
hearing may clap yer name down in his black book said the hostler also
pausing and lifting his eyes to the mullioned and transomed windows and
moulded parapet above himnot to study them as features of ancient
architecture but just to give as healthful a stretch to the eyes as his
acquaintance had done to his back  Michael a old man like you ought to
think about other things and not be looking two ways at your time of
life  Pouncing upon young flesh like a carrion crowtis a vile thing
in a old man
Tis and yet tis not for tis a naterel taste said the milkman
again surveying Ethelberta who had now paused upon a bridge in full
view to look down the river  Now if a poor needy feller like myself
could only catch her alone when shes dressed up to the nines for some
grand party and carry her off to some lonely placesakes what a pot of
jewels and goold things I warrant hed find about her  Twould pay en
for his trouble
I dont dispute the picter but tis sly and untimely to think such
roguery  Though Ive had thoughts like it tis true about high
womenLord forgive me fort
And that figure of fashion standing there is a widow woman so I hear
Ladynot a penny less than lady  Ay a thing of twentyone or
thereabouts
A widow lady and twentyone  Tis a backward age for a body whos so
forward in her state of life
Well be that as twill heres my showings for her age  She was about
the figure of two or threeandtwenty when a got off the carriage last
night tired out wi boaming about the country and nineteen this morning
when she came downstairs after a sleep round the clock and a clanewashed
face so I thought to myself twentyone I thought
And whats the young womans name make so bold hostler
Ay and the house were all in a stoor with her and the old woman and
their boxes and campkettles that they carry to wash in because hand
basons baint big enough and I dont know what all and tother folk
stopping here were no more than dirt thenceforard
I suppose theyve come out of some noble city a long way herefrom
And there was her hair up in buckle as if shed never seen a claycold
man at all  However to cut a long story short all I know besides about
em is that the name upon their luggage is Lady Petherwin and shes the
widow of a city gentleman who was a man of valour in the Lord Mayors
Show
Whos that chap in the gaiters and pack at his back come out of the
door but now said the milkman nodding towards a figure of that
description who had just emerged from the inn and trudged off in the
direction taken by the ladynow out of sight
Chap in the gaiters  Chok it allwhy the father of that nobleman
that you call chap in the gaiters used to be hand in glove with half the
Queens court
What dye tell o
That mans father was one of the mayor and corporation of Sandbourne
and was that familiar with men of money that hed slap em upon the
shoulder as you or I or any other poor fool would the clerk of the
parish
O whats my lordlins name make so bold then
Ay the toppermost class nowadays have left off the use of wheels for
the good of their constitutions so they traipse and walk for many years
up foreign hills where you can see nothing but snow and fog till
theres no more left to walk up and if they reach home alive and hant
got too old and weared out they walk and see a little of their own
parishes  So they tower about with a pack and a stick and a clane white
pockethandkerchief over their hats just as you see hes got on his  Hes
been staying here a night and is off now again  Young man young man
I think to myself if your shoulders were bent like a bandy and your
knees bowed out as mine be till there is not an inch of straight bone or
gristle in ee th wouldstnt go doing hard work for play a blieve
True true upon my song  Such a pain as I have had in my lynes all
this day to be sure words dont know what shipwreck I suffer in these
lynes o minethat they do not  And what was this young widow ladys
maiden name then hostler  Folk have been peeping after her thats
true but they dont seem to know much about her family
And while Ive tended horses fifty year that other folk might straddle
em here I be now not a penny the better  Oftentimes when I see so
many good things about I feel inclined to help myself in common justice
to my pocket
Work hard and be poor
Do nothing and get more
But I draw in the horns of my mind and think to myself Forbear John
Hostler forbearHer maiden name  Faith I dont know the womans
maiden name though she said to me Good evening John but I had no
memory of ever seeing her aforeno no more than the dead inside church
hatchwhere I shall soon be likewiseI had not  Ay my nabs I think
to myself more know Tom Fool than Tom Fool knows
More know Tom Foolwhat rambling old canticle is it you say hostler
inquired the milkman lifting his ear  Lets have it againa good
saying well spit out is a Christmas fire to my withered heart  More know
Tom Fool
Than Tom Fool knows said the hostler
Ah  Thats the very feeling Ive feeled over and over again hostler
but not in such gifted language  Tis a thought Ive had in me for
years and never could lick into shapeOhohoho  Splendid  Say it
again hostler say it again  To hear my own poor notion that had no
name brought into form like thatI wouldnt ha lost it for the world
More know Tom Fool thanthanhhohohoho
Dont let your sense o vitness break out in such uproar for heavens
sake or folk will surely think youve been laughing at the lady and
gentleman  Well heres at it againNight tee Michael  And the
hostler went on with his sweeping
Night tee hostler I must move too said the milkman shouldering his
yoke and walking off and there reached the inn in a gradual diminuendo
as he receded up the street shaking his head convulsively More
knowTom Foolthan Tom Foolhohohohoho
The Red Lion as the inn or hotel was called which of late years had
become the fashion among tourists because of the absence from its
precincts of all that was fashionable and new stood near the middle of
the town and formed a corner where in winter the winds whistled and
assembled their forces previous to plunging helterskelter along the
streets  In summer it was a fresh and pleasant spot convenient for such
quiet characters as sojourned there to study the geology and beautiful
natural features of the country round
The lady whose appearance had asserted a difference between herself and
the Anglebury people without too clearly showing what that difference
was passed out of the town in a few moments and following the highway
across meadows fed by the Froom she crossed the railway and soon got
into a lonely heath  She had been watching the base of a cloud as it
closed down upon the line of a distant ridge like an upper upon a lower
eyelid shutting in the gaze of the evening sun  She was about to return
before dusk came on when she heard a commotion in the air immediately
behind and above her head  The saunterer looked up and saw a wildduck
flying along with the greatest violence just in its rear being another
large bird which a countryman would have pronounced to be one of the
biggest duckhawks that he had ever beheld  The hawk neared its intended
victim and the duck screamed and redoubled its efforts
Ethelberta impulsively started off in a rapid run that would have made a
little dog bark with delight and run after her object being if
possible to see the end of this desperate struggle for a life so small
and unheardof  Her stateliness went away and it could be forgiven for
not remaining for her feet suddenly became as quick as fingers and she
raced along over the uneven ground with such force of tread that being a
woman slightly heavier than gossamer her patent heels punched little Ds
in the soil with unerring accuracy wherever it was bare crippled the
heathertwigs where it was not and sucked the swampy places with a sound
of quick kisses
Her rate of advance was not to be compared with that of the two birds
though she went swiftly enough to keep them well in sight in such an open
place as that around her having at one point in the journey been so near
that she could hear the whisk of the ducks feathers against the wind as
it lifted and lowered its wings  When the bird seemed to be but a few
yards from its enemy she saw it strike downwards and after a level
flight of a quarter of a minute vanish  The hawk swooped after and
Ethelberta now perceived a whitely shining oval of still water looking
amid the swarthy level of the heath like a hole through to a nether sky
Into this large pond which the duck had been making towards from the
beginning of its precipitate flight it had dived out of sight  The
excited and breathless runner was in a few moments close enough to see
the disappointed hawk hovering and floating in the air as if waiting for
the reappearance of its prey upon which grim pastime it was so intent
that by creeping along softly she was enabled to get very near the edge
of the pool and witness the conclusion of the episode  Whenever the duck
was under the necessity of showing its head to breathe the other bird
would dart towards it invariably too late however for the diver was
far too experienced in the rough humour of the buzzard family at this
game to come up twice near the same spot unaccountably emerging from
opposite sides of the pool in succession and bobbing again by the time
its adversary reached each place so that at length the hawk gave up the
contest and flew away a satanic moodiness being almost perceptible in
the motion of its wings
The young lady now looked around her for the first time and began to
perceive that she had run a long distancevery much further than she had
originally intended to come  Her eyes had been so long fixed upon the
hawk as it soared against the bright and mottled field of sky that on
regarding the heather and plain again it was as if she had returned to a
halfforgotten region after an absence and the whole prospect was
darkened to one uniform shade of approaching night  She began at once to
retrace her steps but having been indiscriminately wheeling round the
pond to get a good view of the performance and having followed no path
thither she found the proper direction of her journey to be a matter of
some uncertainty
Surely she said to herself I faced the north at starting and yet
on walking now with her back where her face had been set she did not
approach any marks on the horizon which might seem to signify the town
Thus dubiously but with little real concern she walked on till the
evening light began to turn to dusk and the shadows to darkness
Presently in front of her Ethelberta saw a white spot in the shade and
it proved to be in some way attached to the head of a man who was coming
towards her out of a slight depression in the ground  It was as yet too
early in the evening to be afraid but it was too late to be altogether
courageous and with balanced sensations Ethelberta kept her eye sharply
upon him as he rose by degrees into view  The peculiar arrangement of
his hat and pugree soon struck her as being that she had casually noticed
on a peg in one of the rooms of the Red Lion and when he came close
she saw that his arms diminished to a peculiar smallness at their
junction with his shoulders like those of a doll which was explained by
their being girt round at that point with the straps of a knapsack that
he carried behind him  Encouraged by the probability that he like
herself was staying or had been staying at the Red Lion she said
Can you tell me if this is the way back to Anglebury
It is one way but the nearest is in this direction said the
touristthe same who had been criticized by the two old men
At hearing him speak all the delicate activities in the young ladys
person stood still she stopped like a clock  When she could again fence
with the perception which had caused all this she breathed
Mr Julian she exclaimed  The words were uttered in a way which would
have told anybody in a moment that here lay something connected with the
light of other days
Ah Mrs PetherwinYes I am Mr Julianthough that can matter very
little I should think after all these years and what has passed
No remark was returned to this rugged reply and he continued
unconcernedly Shall I put you in the pathit is just here
If you please
Come with me then
She walked in silence at his heels not a word passing between them all
the way the only noises which came from the two were the brushing of her
dress and his gaiters against the heather or the smart rap of a stray
flint against his boot
They had now reached a little knoll and he turned abruptly That is
Angleburyjust where you see those lights  The path down there is the
one you must follow it leads round the hill yonder and directly into the
town
Thank you she murmured and found that he had never removed his eyes
from her since speaking keeping them fixed with mathematical exactness
upon one point in her face  She moved a little to go on her way he
moved a little lessto go on his
Goodnight said Mr Julian
The moment upon the very face of it was critical and yet it was one of
those which have to wait for a future before they acquire a definite
character as good or bad
Thus much would have been obvious to any outsider it may have been
doubly so to Ethelberta for she gave back more than she had got
replying Goodbyeif you are going to say no more
Then in struck Mr Julian What can I say  You are nothing to me
I could forgive a woman doing anything for spite except marrying for
spite
The connection of that with our present meeting does not appear unless
it refers to what you have done  It does not refer to me
I am not married you are
She did not contradict him as she might have done  Christopher she
said at last this is how it is you knew too much of me to respect me
and too little to pity me  A half knowledge of anothers life mostly
does injustice to the life half known
Then since circumstances forbid my knowing you more I must do my best
to know you less and elevate my opinion of your nature by forgetting
what it consists in he said in a voice from which all feeling was
polished away
If I did not know that bitterness had more to do with those words than
judgment Ishould bebitter too  You never knew half about me you
only knew me as a governess you little think what my beginnings were
I have guessed  I have many times told myself that your early life was
superior to your position when I first met you  I think I may say
without presumption that I recognize a lady by birth when I see her even
under reverses of an extreme kind  And certainly there is this to be
said that the fact of having been bred in a wealthy home does slightly
redeem an attempt to attain to such a one again
Ethelberta smiled a smile of many meanings
However we are wasting words he resumed cheerfully  It is better
for us to part as we met and continue to be the strangers that we have
become to each other  I owe you an apology for having been betrayed into
more feeling than I had a right to show and let us part friends  Good
night Mrs Petherwin and success to you  We may meet again some day
I hope
Good night she said extending her hand  He touched it turned about
and in a short time nothing remained of him but quick regular brushings
against the heather in the deep broad shadow of the moor
Ethelberta slowly moved on in the direction that he had pointed out  This
meeting had surprised her in several ways  First there was the
conjuncture itself but more than that was the fact that he had not
parted from her with any of the tragic resentment that she had from time
to time imagined for that scene if it ever occurred  Yet there was
really nothing wonderful in this it is part of the generous nature of a
bachelor to be not indisposed to forgive a portionless sweetheart who by
marrying elsewhere has deprived him of the bliss of being obliged to
marry her himself  Ethelberta would have been disappointed quite had
there not been a comforting development of exasperation in the middle
part of his talk but after all it formed a poor substitute for the
loving hatred she had expected
When she reached the hotel the lamp over the door showed a face a little
flushed but the agitation which at first had possessed her was gone to a
mere nothing  In the hall she met a slender woman wearing a silk dress
of that peculiar black which in sunlight proclaims itself to have once
seen better days as a brown and days even better than those as a
lavender green or blue
Menlove said the lady did you notice if any gentleman observed and
followed me when I left the hotel to go for a walk this evening
The ladysmaid thus suddenly pulled up in a night forage after lovers
put a hand to her forehead to show that there was no mistake about her
having begun to meditate on receiving orders to that effect and said at
last You once told me maam if you recollect that when you were
dressed I was not to go staring out of the window after you as if you
were a doll I had just manufactured and sent round for sale
Yes so I did
So I didnt see if anybody followed you this evening
Then did you hear any gentleman arrive here by the late train last
night
O no maamhow could I said Mrs Menlovean exclamation which was
more apposite than her mistress suspected considering that the speaker
after retiring from duty had slipped down her dark skirt to reveal a
light puffed and festooned one put on a hat and feather together with
several pennyweights of metal in the form of rings brooches and
earringsall in a time whilst one could count a hundredand enjoyed
halfanhour of prime courtship by an honourable young waiter of the
town who had proved constant as the magnet to the pole for the space of
the day and a half that she had known him
Going at once upstairs Ethelberta ran down the passage and after some
hesitation softly opened the door of the sittingroom in the best suite
of apartments that the inn could boast of
In this room sat an elderly lady writing by the light of two candles with
green shades  Well knowing as it seemed who the intruder was she
continued her occupation and her visitor advanced and stood beside the
table  The old lady wore her spectacles low down her cheek her glance
being depressed to about the slope of her straight white nose in order to
look through them  Her mouth was pursed up to almost a youthful shape as
she formed the letters with her pen and a slight move of the lip
accompanied every downstroke  There were two large antique rings on her
forefinger against which the quill rubbed in moving backwards and
forwards thereby causing a secondary noise rivalling the primary one of
the nib upon the paper
Mamma said the younger lady here I am at last
A writers mind in the midst of a sentence being like a ship at sea
knowing no rest or comfort till safely piloted into the harbour of a full
stop Lady Petherwin just replied with What in an occupied tone not
rising to interrogation  After signing her name to the letter she
raised her eyes
Why how late you are Ethelberta and how heated you look she said
I have been quite alarmed about you  What do you say has happened
The great chief and altogether eclipsing thing that had happened was
the accidental meeting with an old lover whom she had once quarrelled
with and Ethelbertas honesty would have delivered the tidings at once
had not unfortunately all the rest of her attributes been dead against
that act for the old ladys sake even more than for her own
I saw a great cruel bird chasing a harmless duck she exclaimed
innocently  And I ran after to see what the end of it would bemuch
further than I had any idea of going  However the duck came to a pond
and in running round it to see the end of the fight I could not remember
which way I had come
Mercy said her motherinlaw lifting her large eyelids heavy as
windowshutters and spreading out her fingers like the horns of a snail
You might have sunk up to your knees and got lost in that swampy
placesuch a time of night too  What a tomboy you are  And how did
you find your way home after all
O some man showed me the way and then I had no difficulty and after
that I came along leisurely
I thought you had been running all the way you look so warm
It is a warm evening     Yes and I have been thinking of old times
as I walked along she said and how peoples positions in life alter
Have I not heard you say that while I was at Bonn at school some family
that we had known had their household broken up when the father died and
that the children went away you didnt know where
Do you mean the Julians
Yes that was the name
Why of course you know it was the Julians  Young Julian had a day or
twos fancy for you one summer had he notjust after you came to us
at the same time or just before it that my poor boy and you were so
desperately attached to each other
O yes I recollect said Ethelberta  And he had a sister I think  I
wonder where they went to live after the family collapse
I do not know said Lady Petherwin taking up another sheet of paper
I have a dim notion that the son who had been brought up to no
profession became a teacher of music in some country townmusic having
always been his hobby  But the facts are not very distinct in my
memory  And she dipped her pen for another letter
Ethelberta with a rather fallen countenance then left her motherin
law and went where all ladies are supposed to go when they want to
torment their minds in comfortto her own room  Here she thoughtfully
sat down awhile and some time later she rang for her maid
Menlove she said without looking towards a rustle and half a footstep
that had just come in at the door but leaning back in her chair and
speaking towards the corner of the lookingglass will you go down and
find out if any gentleman named Julian has been staying in this house
Get to know it I mean Menlove not by directly inquiring you have ways
of getting to know things have you not  If the devoted George were here
now he would help
George was nothing to me maam
James then
And I only had James for a week or ten days when I found he was a
married man I encouraged his addresses very little indeed
If you had encouraged him heart and soul you couldnt have fumed more
at the loss of him  But please to go and make that inquiry will you
Menlove
In a few minutes Ethelbertas woman was back again  A gentleman of that
name stayed here last night and left this afternoon
Will you find out his address
Now the ladysmaid had already been quickwitted enough to find out
that and indeed all about him but it chanced that a fashionable
illustrated weekly paper had just been sent from the booksellers and
being in want of a little time to look it over before it reached her
mistresss hands Mrs Menlove retired as if to go and ask the
questionto stand meanwhile under the gaslamp in the passage
inspecting the fascinating engravings  But as time will not wait for
tirewomen a natural length of absence soon elapsed and she returned
again and said
His address is Upper Street Sandbourne
Thank you that will do replied her mistress
The hour grew later and that dreamy period came round when ladies
fancies that have lain shut up close as their fans during the day begin
to assert themselves anew  At this time a good guess at Ethelbertas
thoughts might have been made from her manner of passing the minutes
away  Instead of reading entering notes in her diary or doing any
ordinary thing she walked to and fro curled her pretty nether lip
within her pretty upper one a great many times made a cradle of her
locked fingers and paused with fixed eyes where the walls of the room
set limits upon her walk to look at nothing but a picture within her
mind
2 CHRISTOPHERS HOUSESANDBOURNE TOWNSANDBOURNE MOOR
During the wet autumn of the same year the postman passed one morning as
usual into a plain street that ran through the less fashionable portion
of Sandbourne a modern coast town and wateringplace not many miles from
the ancient Anglebury  He knocked at the door of a flatfaced brick
house and it was opened by a slight thoughtful young man with his hat
on just then coming out  The postman put into his hands a book packet
addressed Christopher Julian Esq
Christopher took the package upstairs opened it with curiosity and
discovered within a green volume of poems by an anonymous writer the
titlepage bearing the inscription Metres by E  The book was new
though it was cut and it appeared to have been looked into  The young
man after turning it over and wondering where it came from laid it on
the table and went his way being in haste to fulfil his engagements for
the day
In the evening on returning home from his occupations he sat himself
down cosily to read the newlyarrived volume  The winds of this
uncertain season were snarling in the chimneys and drops of rain spat
themselves into the fire revealing plainly that the young mans room was
not far enough from the top of the house to admit of a twist in the flue
and revealing darkly a little more if that social ruleofthree inverse
the higher in lodgings the lower in pocket were applicable here
However the aspect of the room though homely was cheerful a somewhat
contradictory group of furniture suggesting that the collection consisted
of waifs and strays from a former home the grimy faces of the old
articles exercising a curious and subduing effect on the bright faces of
the new  An oval mirror of rococo workmanship and a heavy cabinetpiano
with a cornice like that of an Egyptian temple adjoined a harmonium of
yesterday and a harp that was almost as new  Printed music of the last
century and manuscript music of the previous evening lay there in such
quantity as to endanger the tidiness of a retreat which was indeed only
saved from a chronic state of litter by a pair of hands that sometimes
played with the lightness of breezes about the sewingmachine standing
