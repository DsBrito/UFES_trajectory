THE GOTHIC PALACES OF VENICE
The location of Venice upon a group of islands sufficiently removed
from the mainland to make it impossible to effectually attack it from
this side and naturally defended on the side towards the sea by a
long chain of low islands separated by shallow inlets and winding
channels making it difficult to approach has rendered the city
peculiarly free from the disturbing influences which were constantly
at work in the neighboring cities of Italy during the Middle Ages
While her neighbors were building strong encircling walls each
individual house a fortress in itself Venice rested secure in her
natural defences and built her palaces open down to the waters
edge with no attempt at fortification Her hardy and adventurous
inhabitants rapidly extended their trade to all quarters of the world
and accumulated vast wealth which was freely lavished on public and
private buildings The magnificence of the former was only equalled in
the days of ancient Rome and it is doubtful if the latter have ever
been surpassed in sumptuousness and splendor The palaces of Venice
form an architectural group of great interest in many respects quite
distinct from the contemporary buildings on the mainland They were
carefully planned to satisfy the demands for comfort and convenience
as well as display Most of them have the same arrangement of plan
and were commonly built of two lofty and two low stories On the
ground floor or water level is a hall running back from the gate to
a bit of garden at the other side of the palace and on either side
of this hall which was hung with the family trophies of the chase and
war are the porters lodge and gondoliers rooms On the first and
second stories are the family apartments opening on either side from
great halls of the same extent as that below but with loftier roofs
of heavy rafters gilded or painted The fourth floor is of the same
arrangement but has a lower roof and was devoted to the better class
of servants Of the two stories used by the family the third is the
loftier and airier and was occupied in summer the second was
the winter apartment On either hand the rooms open in suites
The courtyard at the rear usually had a well in its centre with an
ornamental curb and access to the upper floors of the house was
gained by an exterior staircase in the court which was often
elaborately enriched with carved ornament
The materials used in construction are mostly red and white marbles
used with a fine color sense and the desire for abundance of color
was frequently further gratified by painting the exterior walls with
elaborate pictorial decorations
Illustration II The Palazzo Contarini Fasan Venice
The earliest palaces are Byzantine but with the growth of the Gothic
movement these were gradually superseded although the Gothic
influence worked more slowly here than on the mainland The richest
and most elaborate work was built at this period Finally the
Renaissance took the place of Gothic and the later palaces built in
this style show strongly the debased condition into which the art of
Venice fell in the Dark Ages
We have selected for the illustrations of this number of the BROCHURE
SERIES some of the most widely known examples of the fifteenthcentury
Gothic palaces built at the time when Venice was at the zenith of
prosperity as the principal commercial power of the world
I
SOUTHWEST ANGLE OF THE DUCAL PALACE VENICE
Although the Ducal Palace is much larger than the other palaces of
Venice and intended for general civic uses as well as a residence for
the Duke or Doge it follows closely the type already described It
has undergone so many changes since its first foundation in about the
year 800 813 according to Ruskin having been destroyed five times
and as often reerected in grander style besides having been added to
and the dilapidated portions restored that it is impossible to assign
a comprehensive date to cover the building of the present structure
In fact the earliest portion was gradually added to carrying it
further and further around the quadrangle until it reached the point
of beginning when this process was repeated partially replacing
the older Byzantine work with Gothic and then with Renaissance the
present building still having examples of all three styles
The portion shown in our illustration is said to have been erected
between the years 1424 and 1442 by Giovanni Buon and his sons
Pantaleone and Bartolommeo Buon the elder although Mr Ruskin states
that in 1423 the Grand Council sat in the Great Council Chamber for
the first time and in that year the Gothic Ducal Palace of Venice was
completed
This angle which faces the Piazetta and the Riva is called by
Mr Ruskin the FigTree Angle because of the group of sculpture
representing the fall of man The figure above the angle capital of
the upper arcade is that of Gabriel The richly decorated capitals of
the lower arcade represent personifications of the Virtues and Vices
the favorite subjects of decorative art at this period in all the
cities of Italy The capitals of the upper arcade no two of which are
alike are also richly wrought with figure sculpture the one on the
angle containing representations of the four winds
The arrangement of the tracery above the upper arcade is worthy of
note as the placing of the quatrefoils between the arches which
is characteristic of earlier examples is more reasonable from a
constructive point of view than the later practice of placing them
above the centres of the arches
The use of the rope moulding as a decorative finish for the angle of a
building is also characteristic of the palace architecture of Venice
and may here be seen most effectively applied
II
THE PALAZZO CONTARINI FASAN VENICE
This is one of the most notable examples of domestic Gothic
architecture in Venice and dates from the fifteenth century Ruskin
refers to it as follows In one respect however it deserves to be
regarded with attention as showing how much beauty and dignity may
be bestowed on a very small and unimportant dwellinghouse by Gothic
sculpture Foolish criticisms upon it have appeared in English
accounts of foreign buildings objecting to it on the ground of its
being ill proportioned the simple fact being that there was no room
in this part of the canal for a wider house and that its builder made
its rooms as comfortable as he could and its windows and balconies of
a convenient size for those who were to see through them and stand on
them and left the proportions outside to take care of themselves
which indeed they have very sufficiently done for though the house
thus honestly confesses its diminutiveness it is nevertheless one of
the principal ornaments of the very noblest reach of the Grand Canal
and would be nearly as great a loss if it were destroyed as the
church of La Salute itself
This building is popularly known as Desdemonas House
III
THE PALAZZO CAVALLI VENICE
This palace situated opposite the Academy of Arts on the Grand Canal
also dates from the fifteenth century Its balconies and tracery are
of the later Gothic period showing marked tendencies towards the
Renaissance
It has been recently restored by its present owner Baron Franchetti
and is frequently spoken of as the Palazzo Franchetti
IV
WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CAVALLI
In Venetian tracery it will always be found that a certain arrangement
of quatrefoils and other figures has been planned as if it were to
extend indefinitely into miles of arcade and out of this colossal
piece of marble lace a portion in the shape of a window is cut
mercilessly and fearlessly what fragments and odd shapes of
interstice remnants of this or that figure of the divided foliation
may occur at the edge of the window it matters not all are cut
across and shut in by the great outer archivolt This is of course
open to serious criticism as construction but its beauty and
effectiveness as used here cannot be gainsaid
V
WINDOW TRACERY IN THE PALAZZO CICOGNA VENICE
This is an example of early Gothic work in Venice and is quite unlike
later examples Ruskin speaks of it as the only instance of good
complicated tracery to be found in Venice The fact that it is
moulded only on the face is considered evidence of its early date
In this view as in fact in all of the examples which we have
selected the moulding formed of alternating blocks or dentils
projecting first on one side and then the other which is peculiar to
Venice can be seen It was commonly used as a frame about a window or
group of windows and is very effective especially when used as it
frequently was relieved against a flat wall surface
VI and VII
TWO PORTIONS OF THE FACADE OF THE CA DORO VENICE
This next to the Ducal Palace is the most elaborate and it might be
said the most beautiful of the Gothic Venetian palaces It has been
considerably changed in the various restorations to which it has been
subjected but still has enough of its original features to remain
a wonderfully beautiful building It is an extreme example of the
characteristic disregard of the ordinary principles of building
construction to be found throughout the work we have been considering
Fergussons remarks upon this failing of the Venetian architects is
pointed and well considered He says Most of the faults that strike
us in the buildings of Venice arise from the defective knowledge which
they betray of constructive principles The Venetian architects had
not been brought up in the hard school of practical experience nor
thoroughly grounded in construction as the northern architects were
by the necessities of the large buildings which they erected On the
contrary they merely adopted details because they were pretty
and used them so as to be picturesque in domestic edifices where
convenience was everything and construction but a secondary
consideration
The Ca Doro was probably built about the middle of the fourteenth
century
Evidences of the use of color in this facade can be plainly seen in
the photographic views and the contrast of the deep shadows and flat
wall surfaces is strikingly beautiful
VIII
THE PALAZZO PISANI
This palace is of the late Gothic period nearly approaching the
Renaissance It is situated on the lower reach of the Grand Canal
In all of the examples here selected a marked predominance of
horizontal treatment will be observed The roofs are flat and arcades
and balconies all help to emphasize the horizontal direction in the
design This it will be observed is distinctly different from the
contemporary Gothic of the rest of Europe
Notable examples of American buildings modelled after or in the style
of the Venetian palaces are the Chicago Athletic Club the Montauk
Club Brooklyn and the new building adjoining the Hoffman House
Madison Square New York

A wellselected collection of foreign photographs has come to be as
necessary and invariable a feature in a wellequipped architects
office as good drawing instruments or as Vignolas treatise on the
Roman Orders But unfortunately a really satisfactory collection of
photographs is seldom within the reach of more than a small proportion
of the architects who could use them to advantage This is partly on
account of the expense of a good collection as photographs can hardly
be bought for less than twentyfive cents each and partly on account
of the difficulty of finding a desirable stock from which to make
selections on this side of the Atlantic Nearly all of the most
valuable collections have been gathered together abroad by the owners
and are the result of gradual accumulation probably extending over
years of travel and representing no small investment of money
Such a collection it is needless to say is not within the grasp of
the young and struggling draughtsman but he of all others would
profit most by possession and use of such a treasure if it could be
placed in his hands It would help to form and direct his tastes
making him familiar with the masterpieces of the past and would
furnish a basis for comparison of the current work about him
Of course a draughtsman in any of the larger offices will have certain
opportunities to study and work from the collection in the office
library This is a valuable privilege but it is only open to a few
out of the many draughtsmen in the country and is not to be compared
in its resulting benefits to the actual possession of even a very much
smaller collection
It is the purpose of the BROCHURE SERIES to place in the hands
of draughtsmen a most carefully selected series of photographic
reproductions chosen both for their educational value and their
usefulness as practical reference material for everyday work This can
be done at one fiftieth the cost of ordinary photographs and thus be
easily within the reach of any draughtsman
No attempt will be made to follow any systematic arrangement of the
subjects presented although it will be frequently found advisable
as in the present issue to group a number of subjects of more or
less related character The main result to be sought for is the
presentation of the greatest amount of the most valuable material in
the most available shape and at the least cost The possibility of
realizing this ambitious purpose remains to be demonstrated It need
only be said that this initial number is put forward as an earnest of
the work to follow
A most important feature in recent educational work as applied to
architecture is to be found in the formation of a number of classes
or ateliers as they are called modelled in the main after those in
Paris They are all formed with the purpose of furnishing instruction
in those elements of academic design which are unattainable in the
routine experience of office practice The details of arrangement for
accomplishing this purpose vary somewhat in the different ateliers
We believe the first to be started was the one connected with the
office of Messrs Carrere  Hastings in New York Here a limited
number of students both young men and young women are received and
as a return for the instruction given them are expected to render such
assistance in the regular work of the draughtingroom as they can
This service is exactly similar to the niggering as it is called
required by longestablished custom of the younger men at the Ecole
des BeauxArts at Paris which is one of the most valuable features of
the school work In Paris by this method the younger students have an
opportunity to come in personal and intimate contact with those more
advanced and have the benefit of working on larger and more important
work than they are capable of undertaking unaided In the new
atelier a problem in design is given to the class thus more than
ordinarily equipped for the work before him

VII Portion of the Facade of the Ca Doro Venice
His work while abroad was systematic well directed and untiring and
no one of the succeeding scholars has labored to better advantage or
accomplished more than he although each in turn has had the example
and experience of his predecessors as a guide and stimulus to
increased endeavor Mr Blackalls time was devoted largely to travel
together with the sketching and measuring of important work
Since his return he has built up a successful and varied practice
As an active member of the Boston Society of Architects and the
first president of the Boston Architectural Club he has done much to
advance the best interests of the profession both within its ranks
and in its relations to the public To nothing so much as to his
faithful labors can the success of the Architectural Club be laid He
has made it the largest and most effective organization of its kind
in the country and the draughtsmen of Boston have every reason to be
thankful to him for his unselfish devotion to their interests
He has for several years been the permanent chairman of the
Committee of the Boston Society of Architects appointed to administer
the Rotch Scholarship and through his earnest work the opportunities
open to its holders are being constantly increased
To be continued
Club Notes
The youngest of the architectural societies of the country is the
Cleveland Architectural Club It was organized in November last with a
membership of fifteen which number has been rapidly growing and bids
fair to grow much further In this instance as has been the case in
all the other large cities where similar clubs have been formed it
is the better class of draughtsmen who have felt the need of an
