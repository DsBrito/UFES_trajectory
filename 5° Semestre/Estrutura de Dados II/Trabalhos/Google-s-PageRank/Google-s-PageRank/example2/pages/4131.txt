gives twenty pieces in gold in a purse to the King I chose a gilt
tankard weighing 31 ounces and a half and he is allowed 30 so I paid
12s for the ounce and half over what he is to have but strange it was
for me to see what a company of small fees I was called upon by a great

get their estates After dinner Mr Moore and I to the Theatre where

been a great stir in the City this night by the Fanatiques who had been
up and killed six or seven men but all are fled
A great rising in the city of the Fifthmonarchy men which did
very much disturb the peace and liberty of the people so that all
the trainbands arose in arms both in London and Westminster as
likewise all the kings guards and most of the noblemen mounted
and put all their servants on coach horses for the defence of his
Majesty and the peace of his kingdomRugges Diurnal  The
notorious Thomas Venner the Fifthmonarchy man a cooper and
preacher to a conventicle in Swan Alley Coleman Street with a
small following about fifty in number took arms on the 6th January
for the avowed purpose of establishing the Millennium  He was a
violent enthusiast and persuaded his followers that they were
invulnerable  After exciting much alarm in the City and
skirmishing with the Trained Bands they marched to Caen Wood  They
were driven out by a party of guards but again entered the City
where they were overpowered by the Trained Bands  The men were
brought to trial and condemned four however were acquitted and
two reprieved  The execution of some of these men is mentioned by
Pepys under date January 19th and 21st  A Relation of the
Arraignment and Trial of those who made the late Rebellious
Insurrections in London 1661 is reprinted in Somers Tracts
vol vii  1812 p 469

clothes as a gallant and in them was clearly the prettiest woman in
the whole house and lastly as a man and then likewise did appear
the handsomest man in the house From thence by link to my cozen
Stradwicks where my father and we and Dr Pepys Scott and his wife

cake where the mark for the Queen was cut and so there was two queens
my wife and Mrs Ward and the King being lost they chose the Doctor
to be King so we made him send for some wine and then home and in
our way home we were in many places strictly examined more than in
the worst of times there being great fears of these Fanatiques rising
again for the present I do not hear that any of them are taken Home
it being a clear moonshine and after 12 oclock at night Being come
home we found that my people had been very merry and my wife tells me
afterwards that she had heard that they had got young Davis and some
other neighbours with them to be merry but no harm

caused one of their meetinghouses in London to be pulled down
9th Waked in the morning about six oclock by people running up and
down in Mr Daviss house talking that the Fanatiques were up in arms
in the City And so I rose and went forth where in the street I found
every body in arms at the doors So I returned though with no good
courage at all but that I might not seem to be afeared and got my
sword and pistol which however I had no powder to charge and went to
the door where I found Sir R Ford and with him I walked up and down
as far as the Exchange and there I left him In our way the streets
full of Trainband and great stories what mischief these rogues have
done and I think near a dozen have been killed this morning on both
sides Seeing the city in this condition the shops shut and all things
in trouble I went home and sat it being office day till noon So
home and dined at home my father with me and after dinner he would
needs have me go to my uncle Wights where I have been so long absent
that I am ashamed to go I found him at home and his wife and I can
see they have taken my absence ill but all things are past and we good
friends and here I sat with my aunt till it was late my uncle going
forth about business My aunt being very fearful to be alone So home to
my lute till late and then to bed there being strict guards all night

pints of wormwood and sack Talking of his wooing afresh of Mrs Lane

Mr Coventry who takes it very kindly and sends me a very kind letter
and the plate back again of which my heart is very glad So to Mrs
Hunt where I found a Frenchman a lodger of hers at dinner and just
as I came in was kissing my wife which I did not like though there
could not be any hurt in it Thence by coach to my Uncle Wights with my
wife but they being out of doors we went home where after I had put
some papers in order and entered some letters in my book which I have
a mind to keep I went with my wife to see Sir W Pen who we found ill
still but he do make very much of it Here we sat a great while at
last comes in Mr Davis and his lady who takes it very ill that my wife
never did go to see her and so we fell to talk Among other things Mr
Davis told us the particular examinations of these Fanatiques that are
taken and in short it is this of all these Fanatiques that have done
all this viz routed all the Trainbands that they met with put the
Kings lifeguards to the run killed about twenty men broke through
the City gates twice and all this in the daytime when all the City
was in arms are not in all about 31 Whereas we did believe them
because they were seen up and down in every place almost in the City
and had been about Highgate two or three days and in several other
places to be at least 500 A thing that never was heard of that so
few men should dare and do so much mischief Their word was The King
Jesus and the heads upon the gates Few of them would receive any
quarter but such as were taken by force and kept alive expecting Jesus
to come here and reign in the world presently and will not believe yet
but their work will be carried on though they do die The King this day
came to town

come back again into Portsmouth harbour and in their way by negligence
of the pilot run upon the Horse sand The Queen and she continue
aboard and do not intend to come on shore till she sees what will
become of the young Princess This news do make people think something
indeed that three of the Royal Family should fall sick of the same
disease one after another This morning likewise we had order to see
guards set in all the Kings yards and so we do appoint who and who
should go to them Sir Wm Batten to Chatham Colonel Slingsby and I to

the Coffeehouse where I met Captain Morrice the upholster who
would fain have lent me a horse tonight to have rid with him upon the
Cityguards with the Lord Mayor there being some new expectations of
these rogues but I refused by reason of my going out of town tomorrow
So home to bed

and most amorous melancholy gentleman who is under a despayr in love

goodnatured man by water to Redriffe and so on foot to Deptford our
servants by water where we fell to choosing four captains to command
the guards and choosing the places where to keep them and other things

place all the captains of the fleet coming cap in hand to us Having
staid very late there talking with the Colonel I went home with Mr
Davis storekeeper whose wife is ill and so I could not see her and
was there most princelike lodged with so much respect and honour that

us and seamen of all the ships present repair to us and there we armed
with every one a handspike with which they were as fierce as could be
At last we hear that it was only five or six men that did ride through
the guard in the town without stopping to the guard that was there

dispose of the arms there and settle the guards So to Mr Petts the

into the tarhouses and other places and took great notice of all the
several works belonging to the making of a cable So after a cup of
burnt wineBurnt wine was somewhat similar to mulled wine and
a favourite drinkat the tavern there we took barge and went to
Blackwall and viewed the dock and the new Wet dock which is newly made
there and a brave new merchantman which is to be launched shortly and
they say to be called the Royal Oak Hence we walked to DickShore and
thence to the Towre and so home Where I found my wife and Pall abroad
so I went to see Sir W Pen and there found Mr Coventry come to see
him and now had an opportunity to thank him and he did express much
kindness to me I sat a great while with Sir Wm after he was gone and

one another but I do keep in with them all as much as I can Sir W Pen
is still very ill as when I went Home where my wife not yet come home

me that his mistress do lie this night at Mrs Hunts who is very ill
with which being something satisfied I went to bed
16th This morning I went early to the Comptrollers and so with him by
coach to Whitehall to wait upon Mr Coventry to give him an account of
what we have done which having done I went away to wait upon my Lady
but coming to her lodgings I find that she is gone this morning to
Chatham by coach thinking to meet me there which did trouble me
exceedingly and I did not know what to do being loth to follow her
and yet could not imagine what she would do when she found me not there
In this trouble I went to take a walk in Westminster Hall and by chance
met with Mr Child who went forth with my Lady today but his horse
being bad he come back again which then did trouble me more so that
I did resolve to go to her and so by boat home and put on my boots and
so over to Southwarke to the posthouse and there took horse and guide
to Dartford and thence to Rochester I having good horses and good
way come thither about halfanhour after daylight which was before
6 oclock and I set forth after two where I found my Lady and her
daughter Jem and Mrs Browne and five servants all at a great loss
not finding me here but at my coming she was overjoyed The sport was
how she had intended to have kept herself unknown and how the Captain
whom she had sent for of the Charles had forsoothed

so to bed there coming several of the Charless men to see me before I
got to bed The page lay with me

Blake to carry her in the barge on board and so we went through Ham
Creeke to the Soverayne a goodly sight all the way to see the brave
ships that lie here first which is a most noble ship I never saw her
before My Lady Sandwich my Lady Jemimah Mrs Browne Mrs Grace
and Mary and the page my ladys servants and myself all went into the
lanthorn together From thence to the Charles where my lady took great
pleasure to see all the rooms and to hear me tell her how things are
when my Lord is there After we had seen all then the officers of
the ship had prepared a handsome breakfast for her and while she was
pledging my Lords health they give her five guns That done we went
off and then they give us thirteen guns more I confess it was a great
pleasure to myself to see the ship that I begun my good fortune in From
thence on board the Newcastle to show my Lady the difference between
a great and a small ship Among these ships I did give away L7 So back
again and went on shore at Chatham where I had ordered the coach to
wait for us Here I heard that Sir William Batten and his lady who I
knew were here and did endeavour to avoyd were now gone this morning
to London So we took coach and I went into the coach and went through
the town without making stop at our inn but left J Goods to pay the
reckoning So I rode with my lady in the coach and the page on the
horse that I should have rid onhe desiring it It begun to be dark
before we could come to Dartford and to rain hard and the horses
to fayle which was our great care to prevent for fear of my Lords
displeasure so here we sat up for tonight as also Captains Cuttance
and Blake who came along with us We sat and talked till supper and at
supper my Lady and I entered into a great dispute concerning what were
best for a man to do with his estatewhether to make his elder son
heir which my Lady is for and I against but rather to make all
equall This discourse took us much time till it was time to go to bed
but we being merry we bade my Lady goodnight and intended to have gone
to the Posthouse to drink and hear a pretty girl play of the cittern
and indeed we should have lain there but by a mistake we did not but
it was late and we could not hear her and the guard came to examine
what we were so we returned to our Inn and to bed the page and I in
one bed and the two captains in another all in one chamber where we
had very good mirth with our most abominable lodging
18th The Captains went with me to the posthouse about 9 oclock and
after a morning draft I took horse and guide for London and through
some rain and a great wind in my face I got to London at eleven
oclock At home found all well but the monkey loose which did anger
me and so I did strike her till she was almost dead that they might
make her fast again which did still trouble me more In the afternoon
we met at the office and sat till night and then I to see my father who
I found well and took him to Standings to drink a cup of ale He told
me my aunt at Brampton is yet alive and my mother well there In comes
Will Joyce to us drunk and in a talking vapouring humour of his state
and I know not what which did vex me cruelly After him Mr Hollier had
learned at my fathers that I was here where I had appointed to meet
him and so he did give me some things to take for prevention Will
Joyce not letting us talk as I would I left my father and him and took
Mr Hollier to the Greyhound where he did advise me above all things
both as to the stone and the decay of my memory of which I now complain
to him to avoid drinking often which I am resolved if I can to
leave off Hence home and took home with me from the booksellers
Ogilbys AEsop which he had bound for me and indeed I am very much
pleased with the book Home and to bed
19th To the Comptrollers and with him by coach to White Hall in our
way meeting Venner and Pritchard upon a sledge who with two more Fifth
Monarchy men were hanged today and the two first drawn and quartered
Where we walked up and down and at last found Sir G Carteret whom
I had not seen a great while and did discourse with him about our
assisting the Commissioners in paying off the Fleet which we think to
decline Here the Treasurer did tell me that he did suspect Thos
Hater to be an informer of them in this work which we do take to be a
diminution of us which do trouble me and I do intend to find out
the truth Hence to my Lady who told me how Mr Hetley is dead of the
smallpox going to Portsmouth with my Lord My Lady went forth to dinner
to her fathers and so I went to the Leg in King Street and had a
rabbit for myself and my Will and after dinner I sent him home and
myself went to the Theatre where I saw The Lost Lady which do not
please me much Here I was troubled to be seen by four of our office
clerks which sat in the halfcrown box and I in the 1s 6d From thence

to the Commissioners for paying off the Army and Navy where the Duke
of Albemarle was and we sat with our hats on and did discourse about
paying off the ships and do find that they do intend to undertake it
without our help and we are glad of it for it is a work that will much
displease the poor seamen and so we are glad to have no hand in it
From thence to the Exchequer and took L200 and carried it home and so
to the office till night and then to see Sir W Pen whither came my
Lady Batten and her daughter and then I sent for my wife and so we sat
talking till it was late So home to supper and then to bed having
eat no dinner today It is strange what weather we have had all this
winter no cold at all but the ways are dusty and the flyes fly up and
down and the rosebushes are full of leaves such a time of the year
as was never known in this world before here This day many more of the
Fifth Monarchy men were hanged
22nd To the Comptrollers house where I read over his proposals to the
Lord Admiral for the regulating of the officers of the Navy in which he
hath taken much pains only he do seem to have too good opinion of them
himself From thence in his coach to Mercers Chappell and so up to the
great hall where we met with the Kings Councell for Trade upon some
proposals of theirs for settling convoys for the whole English trade
and that by having 33 ships four fourthrates nineteen fifths ten
sixths settled by the King for that purpose which indeed was argued
very finely by many persons of honour and merchants that were there It
pleased me much now to come in this condition to this place where I was
once a petitioner for my exhibition in Pauls School and also where Sir
G Downing my late master was chairman and so but equally concerned
with me From thence home and after a little dinner my wife and I by
coach into London and bought some glasses and then to Whitehall to
see Mrs Fox but she not within my wife to my mother Bowyer and I met
with Dr Thomas Fuller and took him to the Dog where he tells me of
his last and great book that is coming out that is his History of all
the Families in England and could tell me more of my own than I
knew myself And also to what perfection he hath now brought the art
of memory that he did lately to four eminently great scholars dictate
together in Latin upon different subjects of their proposing faster
than they were able to write till they were tired and by the way in
discourse tells me that the best way of beginning a sentence if a man
should be out and forget his last sentence which he never was that
then his last refuge is to begin with an Utcunque From thence I to Mr
Bowyers and there sat a while and so to Mr Foxs and sat with them
a very little while and then by coach home and so to see Sir Win Pen
where we found Mrs Martha Batten and two handsome ladies more and so
we staid supper and were very merry and so home to bed

Bishopsgate Street from 1596 when Lady Gresham Sir Thomass
widow died  The meeting which Pepys attended was an early one of
the Royal Society which was incorporated by royal charter in 1663
where I never was before and saw the manner of the house and found
great company of persons of honour there thence to my booksellers
and for books and to Stevens the silversmith to make clean some plate
against tomorrow and so home by the way paying many little debts for
wine and pictures c which is my great pleasure Home and found all
things in a hurry of business Slater our messenger being here as my
cook till very late I in my chamber all the evening looking over my
Osborns works and new Emanuel Thesaurus Patriarchae So late to
