from reading his newspaper
CAT AND KATE
My father is always talking about how a dog can be very educational for a
boy This is one reason I got a cat
My father talks a lot anyway Maybe being a lawyer he gets in the habit
Also heas a small guy with very little gray curly hair so maybe he
thinks heas got to roar a lot to make up for not being a big hairy tough
guy Mom is thin and quiet and when anything upsets her she gets asthma
In the apartmentawe live right in the middle of New York Cityawe donat
have any heavy drapes or rugs and Mom never fries any food because the
doctors figure dust and smoke make her asthma worse I donat think itas
dust I think itas Popas roaring
The big hassle that led to me getting Cat came when I earned some extra
money babysitting for a little boy around the corner on Gramercy Park I
spent the money on a Belafonte record This record has one piece about a
father telling his son about the birds and the bees I think itas funny
Pop blows his stack
aYouare not going to play that stuff in this housea he roars aWhy arenat
you outdoors anyway Babysitting Babytalk records When I was your
age I made money on a newspaperdelivery route and my dog Jeff and I
used to go ten miles chasing rabbits on a good Saturdaya
aPopa I say patiently athere are no rabbits out on Third Avenue Honest
there arenata
aDonat get fresha Pop jerks the plug out of the record player so hard the
needle skips which probably wrecks my record So I get mad and start
yelling too Between rounds we both hear Mom in the kitchen starting to
wheeze
Pop hisses aNow seeayouave gone and upset your mothera
I slam the record player shut grab a stick and ball and run down the
three flights of stairs to the street
This isnat the first time Pop and I have played this scene and there gets
to be a pattern When I slam out of our house mad I go along over to my
Aunt Kateas Sheas not really my aunt The kids around here call her Crazy
Kate the Cat Woman because she walks along the street in funny old clothes
and sneakers talking to herself and she sometimes has half a dozen or
more stray cats living with her I guess she does sound a little looney
but itas just because she does things her own way and she doesnat give a
hoot what people think Sheas sane all right In fact she makes a lot
better sense than my pop
It was three or four years ago when I was a little kid and I came
tearing down our stairs crying mad after some fight with Pop that I first
met Kate I plunged out of our door and into the street without looking
At the same moment I heard brakes scream and felt someone yank me back by
the scruff of my neck I got dropped in a heap on the sidewalk
I looked up and there was a shiny black car with MD plates and Kate
waving her umbrella at the driver and shouting aListen Dr Big Shot
whose life are you saving Canat you even watch out for a sniveling little
kid crossing the streeta
The doctor looked pretty sheepish and so did I A few people on the
sidewalk stopped to watch and snicker at us Our janitor Butch was there
shaking his finger at me Kate nodded to him and told him she was taking
me home to mop me up
aYasama said Butch He says aYasama to all ladies
Kate dragged me along by the hand to her apartment She didnat say
anything when we got there just dumped me in a chair with a couple of
kittens Then she got me a cup of tea and a bowl of cottage cheese
That stopped me snuffling to ask aWhat do I put the cottage cheese ona
aDonat put it on anything Just eat it Eat a bowl of it every day Here
have an orange too But no cookies or candy none of that sweet starchy
stuff And no string beans Theyare not good for youa
My eyes must have popped but I guess I knew right that first day that you
donat argue with Kate I ate the cottage cheeseait doesnat really have any
taste anywayaand I sure have always agreed with her about the string
beans
Off and on since then Iave seen quite a lot of Kate Iad pass her on the
street chirruping to some mangy old stray cat hiding under a car and
head always come out to be stroked Sometimes theread be a bunch of little
kids dancing around jeering at her and calling her a witch It made me
feel real good and important to run them off
Quite often I went with her to the A  P and helped her carry home the cat
food and cottage cheese and fruit She talks to herself all the time in
the store and if she thinks the peaches or melons donat look good that
day she shouts clear across the store to the manager He comes across and
picks her out an extra good one just to keep the peace
I introduced Kate to Mom and they got along real well Kateas leery of
most people afraid theyall make fun of her I guess my momas not leery
of people but sheas shy and what with asthma and worrying about keeping
me and Pop calmed down she doesnat go out much or make dates with people
She and Kate would chat together in the stores or sitting on the stoop on
a sunny day Kate shook her head over Momas asthma and said shead get over
it if she ate cottage cheese every day Mom ate it for a while but she
put mayonnaise on it which Kate says is just like poison
The day of the fight with Pop about the Belafonte record itas cold and
windy out and there are no kids in sight I slam my ball back and forth
against the wall where it says aNo Ball Playinga just to limber up and
let off a little spite and then I go over to see Kate
Kate has a permanent cat named Susan and however many kittens Susan
happens to have just had It varies Usually there are a few other
temporary stray kittens in the apartment but I never saw any father cat
there before Today Susan and her kittens are under the stove and Susan
keeps hissing at a big tigerstriped tomcat crouching under the sofa He
turns his head away from her and looks like he never intended to get mixed
up with family life For a stray cat heas sleek and healthylooking Every
time he moves a whisker Susan hisses again warningly She believes in no
visiting rights for fathers
Kate pours me some tea and asks whatas doing
aMy pop is full of hot air as usuala I say
aTakes one to know onea Kate says catching me off base I change the
subject
aHow come the kittensa pop is around the house I never saw a fullgrown
tom here beforea
aHe saw me buying some cans of cat food so he followed me home Susan
isnat admitting she ever knew him or ever wants to Iall give him another
feed and send him on his way I guess Heas a handsome young fellowa Kate
strokes him between the ears and he rotates his head Susan hisses
He starts to pull back farther under the sofa Without stopping to think
myself or giving him time to I pick him up Susan arches up and spits I
can feel the muscles in his body tense up as he gets ready to spring out
of my lap Then he changes his mind and decides to take advantage of the
lap He narrows his eyes and gives Susan a bored look and turns his head
to take me in After heas sized me up he pretends he only turned around
to lick his back
aCata I say to him ahow about coming home with mea
aHaha Kate laughs aYour pop will throw him out faster than you can say
agood old Jeffaa
aYeahha I say it slowly and do some thinking Taking Cat home had been
just a passing thought but right now I decide Iall really go to the mat
with Pop about this He can have his memories of good old Jeff and rabbit
hunts but Iam going to have me a tiger
Aunt Kate gives me a can of cat food and a box of litter so Cat can stay
in my room because I remember Mom probably gets asthma from animals too
Cat and I go home
Pop does a lot of shouting and sputtering when we get home but I just put
Cat down in my room and I try not to argue with him so I wonat lose my
temper I promise Iall keep him in my room and sweep up the cat hairs so
Mom wonat have to
As a final blast Pop says aI suppose youall get your exercise mouse
hunting now What are you going to name the noble animala
aLook Popa I explain aI know heas a cat he knows heas a cat and his
name is Cat And even if you call him Honorable John Fitzgerald Kennedy
he wonat come when you call and he wonat lick your hand seea
aHead better not And itas not my hand thatas going to get licked around
here in a minutea Pop snaps
aAll right all righta
Actually my pop sometimes jaws so long itad be a relief if he did haul
off and hit me but he never does
We call it a draw for that day and I have Cat

CAT AND THE UNDERWORLD
Cat makes himself at home in my room pretty easily Mostly he likes to be
up on top of something so I put an old sweater on the bureau beside my
bed and he sleeps up there When he wants me to wake up in the morning
he jumps and lands in the middle of my stomach Believe me cats donat
always land lightlyaonly when they want to Anything a cat does he does
only when he wants to I like that
When Iam combing my hair in the morning sometimes he sits up there and
looks down his nose at my reflection in the mirror He appears to be
taking inventory aHmm buckteeth sandy hair smooth in front cowlick in
back brown eyes canat see in the dark worth a nickel hickeys on the
chin Too bada
I look back at him in the mirror and say aOK black face yellow eyes
and one white whisker Wheread you get that one white whiskera
He catches sight of himself in the mirror and his tail twitches
momentarily He seems to know itas not really another cat but his claws
come out and he taps the mirror softly just to make sure
When Iam lying on the bed reading sometimes he will curl up between my
knees and the book But after a few days I can see heas getting more and
more restless It gets so I canat listen to a record for the noise of him
scratching on the rug I canat let him loose in the apartment at least
until we make sure Mom doesnat get asthma so I figure I better
reintroduce him to the great outdoors in the city One nice Sunday morning
in April we go down and sit on the stoop
Cat sits down very tall and neat and pearshaped and closes his eyes
about halfway He glances at the street like it isnat good enough for him
After a while condescending he eases down the steps and lies on a sunny
dusty spot in the middle of the sidewalk People walking have to step
around him and he squints at them
Then he gets up quick looks over his shoulder at nothing and shoots
down the stairs to the cellar I take a look to see where heas going and
he is pacing slowly toward the backyard head down a tiger on the prowl
I figure Iall sit in the sun and finish my sciencefiction magazine before
I go after him
When I do heas not in sight and the janitor tells me he jumped up on the
wall and probably down into one of the other yards I look around a while
and call but heas not in sight and I go up to lunch Along toward
evening Cat scratches at the door and comes in as if head done it all his
life
This gets to be a routine Sometimes he doesnat even come home at night
and heas sitting on the doormat when I get the milk in the morning
looking offended
aIs it my fault you stayed out all nighta I ask him
He sticks his tail straight up and marches down the hall to the kitchen
where he waits for me to open the milk and dish out the cat food Then he
goes to bed
One morning heas not there when I open the door and he still hasnat
showed up when I get back from school I get worried and go down to talk
to Butch
aWaala says Butch asometimes that cat sit and talk to me a little but
most times he go on over to Twentyfirst Street where he sit and talk to
his lady friend Turned cold last night lot of buildings put on heat and
closed up their basements Maybe he got locked in somewheresa
aWhich buildingas his friend live ina I ask
aFortysix the big one His friendas a little blackandwhite cat sort
of belongs to the night man over there He feeds hera
I go around to Twentyfirst Street and case Fortysix which is a pretty
fairlooking building with a striped awning and a doorman who saunters out
front and looks around every few minutes
While Iam watching a grocery boy comes along pushing his cart and goes
down some stairs into the basement with his carton of groceries This
gives me an idea Iall give the boy time to get started up in the
elevator and then Iall go down in the basement and hunt for Cat If
someone comes along and gets sore I can always play dumb
I go down and the coast is clear The elevatoras gone up and I walk
softly past and through a big room where the tenants leave their baby
carriages and bicycles After this the cellar stretches off into several
corridors lit by twentywatt bulbs dangling from the ceiling You can
hardly see anything The corridors go between wire storage cages where
the tenants keep stuff like trunks and old cribs and parakeet cages
Theyare all locked
aMeow meow meowa Unmistakably Cat and angry
The sound comes from the end of one corridor and I fumble along peering
into each cage to try to see a tiger cat in a shadowy hole Fortunately
his eyes glow and he opens his mouth for another meow and I see him
locked inside one of the cages before I come to the end of the corridor I
donat know how he got in or how Iam going to get him out
While Iam thinking Catas eyes flick away from me to the right then back
to me Catas not making any noise and neither am I but something is
Itas just a tiny rustle or a breath but I have a creepy feeling someone
is standing near us Way down at the end of the cellar a shadow moves a
little and I can see it has a white splotchaa face Itas a man and he
comes toward me
I donat know why any of the building men would be way back there but
thatas who I figure it is so I start explaining
aI was just hunting for my cat  I mean heas got locked in one of these
cages I just want to get him outa
The guy lets his breath out slow as if heas been holding it quite a
while I realize he doesnat belong in that cellar either and heas been
scared of me
He moves forward saying aShhha very quietly Heas taller than I am and
I canat see what he really looks like but Iam sure heas sort of a kid
maybe eighteen or so
He looks at the padlock on the cage and says aHuh cheapa He takes a
paper clip out of his pocket and opens it out and I think maybe he has a
penknife too and next thing I know the padlock is open
aGee howad you do thata
aShhh A guy showed me how You better get your cat and scrama
Golly I wonder maybe the guy is a burglar and that gives me another
creepy feeling But would a burglar be taking time out to get a kidas cat
free
aWell thanks for the cat See you arounda I say
aShhh I donat live around here Hurry up before we both get caughta
Maybe heas a real burglar with a gun even I think and by the time I
dodge past the elevators and get out in the cold April wind the sweat
down my back is freezing I give Cat a long lecture on staying out of
basements After all I canat count on having a burglar handy to get him
out every time
Back home we put some nice jailhouse blues on the record player and we
both stretch out on the bed to think The guy didnat really look like a
burglar And he didnat talk adese and dosea Maybe real burglars donat all
talk that wayaonly the ones on TV Still he sure picked that lock fast
and he was sure down in that cellar for some reason of his own
Maybe I ought to let someone know I figure Iall test Pop out just casual
like aSome queerlooking types hanging around this neighborhooda I say
at dinner aI saw a toughlooking guy hanging around Number Fortysix this
afternoon Might have been a burglar evena
I figure Popall at least ask me what he was doing and maybe Iall tell him
the whole thingaabout Cat and the cage But Pop says aIn case you didnat
know it burglars do not all look like Humphrey Bogart and they donat
wear signsa
aThanks for the newsa I say and go on eating my dinner Even if Pop does
make me sore Iam not going to pass up steak and onions which we donat
have very often
However the next day Iam walking along Twentyfirst Street and I see the
super of Fortysix standing by the back entrance so I figure Iall try
again I say to him aUs kids were playing ball here yesterday and we saw
a strangelooking guy sneak into your cellar It wasnat a delivery boya
aYeah You sure it wasnat you or one of your juvenile pals trying to swipe
a bike How come you have to play ball right herea
aI donat swipe bikes I got one of my own New A Raleigh Better than any
junk you got in therea
aWhat dayou know about what I got in there wise guya
aAw forget ita I realize heas just getting suspicious of me Thatas what
comes of trying to be a big publicspirited citizen I decide my burglar
whoever he is is a lot nicer than the super and I hope he got a fat
haul
Next day it looks like maybe he did just that The local paper Town and
Village has a headline aGramercy Park Cellar Robbeda I read down the
article
aThe superintendent Fred Snood checked the cellar storage cages after a
passing youth hinted to him that there had been a robbery He found one
cage open and a suitcase missing Police theorize that the youth may have
been the burglar or an accomplice with a guilty conscience or a grudge
and they are hunting him for questioning Mr Snood described him as about
sixteen years of age medium height with a long aducktaila haircut and
wearing a heavy black sweater They are also checking secondhand stores
for the stolen suitcasea
The burglar stole a suitcase with valuable papers and some silver and
jewelry in it But the guy they were hunting foraI read the paragraph over
and feel green Thatas me I get up and look in the mirror In other
circumstances Iad like being taken for sixteen instead of fourteen which
I am I smooth my hair and squint at the back of it The ducktail is fine
Slowly I peel off my black sweater which I wear practically all the time
and stuff it in my bottom drawer under my bathing suit But if I want to
walk around the street without worrying about every cop Iall have to do
more than that I put on a shirt and necktie and suit jacket and stick a
cap on my head I head uptown on the subway At Sixtyeighth Street I get
off and find a barbershop
aButch cuta I tell the guy
aThatas right Iall trim you nice and neat Get rid of all this stuffa
And while he chatters on like an idiot I have to watch three monthsa work
go snip snip on the floor Then I have to pay for it At home I get the
same routine Pop looks at my IvyLeague disguise and says aWhy you may
look positively human some daya
Two days later I find out I couldave kept my hair Town and Village has
a new story aNab Cellar Thief Returning Loot aJust A Beta He Saysa
The story is pretty interesting The guy I met in the cellar is named Tom
Ransom and he is nineteen and just sort of floating around in the city
He doesnat seem to have any family The police kept a detective watching
Number Fortysix and pretty soon they see Tom walking along with the
stolen suitcase He drops it inside the delivery entrance and walks on
but the cop collars him I suppose if it hadnat been for me shooting my
big mouth off to the super the police wouldnat have been watching the
neighborhood I feel sort of responsible
The story in the paper goes on to say this guy was broke and hunting for a
job and some other guy dares him to snatch something out of a cellar and
finally bets him ten dollars so he does it He gets out and finds the
suitcase has a lot of stocks and legal papers and table silver in it and
heas scared stiff So he figures to drop it back where it came from The
paper says heas held over to appear before some magistrate in Adolescent
Court
I wonder would they send a guy to jail for that Or if they turn him
loose what does he do It must be lousy to be in this city without any
family or friends
At that point I get the idea Iall write him a letter After all Cat and I
sort of got him into the soup So I look up the name of the magistrate and
spend about half an hour poring through the phone book under aNew York
City ofa to get an address I wonder whether to address him as aToma or
aMr Ransoma Finally I write
Dear Tom Ransom
I am the kid you met in the cellar at Number Fortysix Gramercy and I
certainly thank you for unlocking that cage and getting my cat out Cat is
fine I am sorry you got in trouble with the police It sounds to me like
you were only trying to return the stuff and do right My father is a
lawyer if you would like one I guess heas pretty good Or if you would
like to write me anyway here is my address 150 East 22 St I read in the
paper that your family donat live in New York which is why I thought you
might like someone to write to
Yours sincerely
Dave Mitchell
Now that Iam a free citizen again I dig out my black sweater look
disgustedly at the butch haircut and go out to mail my letter
Later on I get into a stickball game again on Twentyfirst Street Cat
comes along and sits up high on a stoop across the street where he can
watch the ball game and the tame dogs being led by on their leashes That
big brain the super of Fortysix is standing by the delivery entrance
looking sour as usual
aGot any burglars in your basement these daysa I yell to him while Iam
jogging around the bases on a long hit
He looks at me and my short haircut and scratches his own bald egg
aWheread I see youa he asks suspiciously
aOhaCat and I we get arounda I say

CAT AND CONEY
Nick and I have been friends pretty much since I can remember Our mothers
used to trade turns fetching us from kindergarten Nick lives around the
corner on Third Avenue upstairs over the grocery store his old man runs
If anyone asked me how come weare friends I couldnat exactly say Weare
just together most of the time
Neither of us is a real whiz at sports but we used to rollerskate and
play a little king and stickball and ride our bikes around exploring One
time when we were about ten we rode way over to Twelfth Avenue at the
Hudson River where the Queen Mary docks This is about the only time I
remember my mom getting really angry She said Pop ought to take my bike
away from me and he did but only for about a week Nick and I still ride
bikes a lot Otherwise we sit and do our homework or play chess and listen
to records
Another reason weare friends is because of this creepy little kid who
lived down toward the corner between me and Nick He always tagged along
wanting to play with us and of course in the end he always fouled up the
game or fell down and started to cry Then his big brother came rushing
out usually with another big guy along and they figured they were
entitled to beat us up for hurting little Joey
After a while it looked to me as if Joey just worked as a lookout and the
minute me or Nick showed up on the block one of the big guys came to run
us off They did little things like throwing sticks into our bike spokes
and pretending it was just a joke Nick and I used to plot all kinds of
ways to get even with them but in the end we mostly decided it was easier
to walk around the block the long way to get to each otheras houses Iam
not much on fighting and neither is Nickaaspecially not with guys bigger
than us
Summers up in the country the kids seem to be all the time wrestling and
punching half for fun and half not If I walk past some strange kid my
age up there he almost always tries to get me into a fight I donat get
it Maybe itas because sidewalks are uncomfortable for fighting but we
just donat do much scrapping for fun The only couple of fights I ever
had I was real mad
Come spring Nick and I got restless hanging around the street with
nothing to do but stickball and baiting the super at Fortysix It was so
easy to get him sore it wasnat even fun Cat stayed out of that basement
but I wanted to get him really out in the open where he could chase
squirrels or something
One day we rode our bikes up to Central Park I put Cat in a wicker hamper
and tied it on the back of my bike He meowed a lot and people on the
street would look at me and then do a double take when they heard him
We got up to Central Park and into a place they call The Horseshoe
because the parking area is that shape I opened the lid a crack to look
at Cat He hissed at me the first time he ever did I looked around and
thought Gee if I let him loose he could go anywhere even over into the
woods and I might never catch him There were a lot of hoody looking kids
around and I could see if I ever left my bike a second to chase Cat
theyad snatch the bike So I didnat let Cat out and I wolfed my sandwich
and we went home Nick was pretty disgusted
Then we hit a hot Saturday the first one in May and I get an idea I
find Nick and say aLetas put Cat and some sandwiches in the basket and
hop the subway out to Coneya
Nick says aWhy bring Cat He wrecked the last expeditiona
aI like to take him places and this wonat be like Central Park No oneas
at Coney this time of year He can chase around on the beach and hunt sand
crabsa
aWhy do I have to have a nut for a frienda Nick moans aWell anyway Iam
keeping my sandwich in my pocket not in any old cat basketa
aWho cares where you keep your crumby sandwicha
So we went Lots of people might think Coney Island is ugly with all the
junkylooking booths and billboards But when you turn your back on them
and look out at the ocean itas the same ocean as on a deserted beach I
kick off my shoes and stand with my feet in the ice water and the sun hot
on my chest Looking out at the horizon with its few ships and some sea
gulls and planes overhead I think Itas mine all mine I could go
anywhere in the world I could Maybe I will
Nick throws water down my neck He only understands infinity on math
papers I let Cat out of the basket and strip off my splashed shirt and
chase Nick along the edge of the water No need to worry about Cat He
chases right along with us and every time a wave catches his feet he
hisses and hightails it up the beach Then he rolls himself in the hot
dry sand and gets up and shakes There are a few other groups of people
dotted along the beach A big mutt dog comes and sniffs Cat and gets a
right and a left scratch to the nose He yelps and runs for home Cat
discovers sand crabs Nick and I roll around in the sand and wrestle and
after a while we get hungry so we go back where we left the basket Cat
is content to let me carry him
Three girls are having a picnic right near our basket One yells to the
others aHey look The guy went swimming with his cata
Cat jumps down turns his back on them and humps himself around on my
sweater until he is settled for a nap I turn my back on the girls too
and look out at the ocean
Still itas not the same as it would have been a year ago Then Nick and I
would either have moved away from the girls or thrown sand at them
We just sit and eat our sandwiches Nick looks over at them pretty often
and whispers to me how old do I think they are I canat tell about girls
Some of the ones in our class at school look about twentyfive but then
you see mothers pushing baby carriages on the street who look about
fifteen
One of the girls catches Nickas eye and giggles aHi there whatcha
watchinga
aIam a bird watchera says Nick aSeen any birdsa
The girls drift over our way The one that spoke first is a redhead The
one who seems to be the leader is a big blonde in a real short skirt and
hair piled up high in a birdas nest Maybe thatas what started Nick
birdwatching The third girl is sort of quietlooking with brown hair I
guess
aYou want a couple of cupcakes You can have mine Iam going on a dieta
says the blonde
aThanksa says Nick aI was thinking of going after some cokesa
aWhy waste time thinking You might hurt your heada says the redhead
The third girl bends down and strokes Cat between the ears very gently
She says aWhatas his namea
I explain to her about why Cat is Cat She sits down and picks up a piece
of seaweed to dangle over his nose Cat makes a couple of sleepy swipes at
it and then stretches luxuriously while she strokes him The other kids
get to talking and we tell each other our names and where we go to school
and all that stuff
Then Nick gets back on the subject of going for cokes I donat really want
to stay there alone with the girls so I say Iall go I tell Nick to watch
Cat and the girl who is petting him says aDonat worry I wonat let him
run awaya
Itas a good thing sheas there because by the time I get back with the
cokes which no one offers to pay me back for Nick and the other two
girls are halfway down the beach Maryathatas her nameasays aI never saw
a cat at the beach before but he seems to like it Wheread you get hima
aHeas a stray I got him from an old lady whoas sort of a nut about cats
Come on Iall see if I can get him to chase waves for you He was doing it
earliera
We are running along in the waves when the other kids come back The big
blonde kicks up water at me and yells aRace youa
So I chase and just as Iam going to catch up she stops short so I crash
into her and we both fall down This seems to be what she had in mind but
I bet the other kids are watching and I feel silly I roll away and get up
and go back to Cat
While we drink cokes the blonde and the redhead say they want to go to the
movies
aWhatas ona Nick asks
aThereas a Sinatra thing at the neighborhooda the blonde tells him and
he looks interested
aI canata I say aIave got Cat Besides itas too late Momad think Iad
fallen into the subwaya
aI told you that cat was a mistakea says Nick
