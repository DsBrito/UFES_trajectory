it is not in our Universities that the general redemption of
English will be won nor need a mistake here or there at Oxford
or Cambridge or London prove fatal We make our discoveries
through our mistakes we watch one anothers success and where
there is freedom to experiment there is hope to improve A youth
who can command means to enter a University can usually command
some range in choosing which University it shall be If Cambridge
cannot supply what he wants or if our standard of training be
low in comparison with that of Oxford or of London or of
Manchester the pressure of neglect will soon recall us to our
senses
The real battle for English lies in our Elementary Schools and
in the training of our Elementary Teachers It is there that the
foundations of a sound national teaching in English will have to
be laid as it is there that a wrong trend will lead to incurable
issues For the poor child has no choice of Schools and the
elementary teacher whatever his individual gifts will work
under a yoke imposed upon him by Whitehall I devoutly trust that
Whitehall will make the yoke easy and adaptable while insisting
that the chariot must be drawn
I foresee then these lectures condemned as the utterances of a
man who occupying a Chair has contrived to fall betwixt two
stools My thoughts have too often strayed from my audience in a
University theatre away to remote rural classrooms where the
hungry sheep look up and are not fed to piteous groups of
urchins standing at attention and chanting The Wreck of the
Hesperus in unison Yet to these being tied to the place and
the occasion I have brought no real help
A man has to perform his task as it comes But I must say this in
conclusion Could I wipe these lectures out and rewrite them in
hope to benefit my countrymen in general I should begin and end
upon the text to be found in the twelfth and lastthat a liberal
education is not an appendage to be purchased by a few that
Humanism is rather a quality which can and should condition
all our teaching which can and should be impressed as a
character upon it all from a poor childs first lesson in
reading up to a tutors last word to his pupil on the eve of a
Tripos

LECTURE I
INTRODUCTORY
WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 25 1916
I
In the third book of the Ethics and in the second chapter
Aristotle dealing with certain actions which though bad in
themselves admit of pity and forgiveness because they were
committed involuntarily through ignorance instances the man
who did not know a subject was forbidden like Aeschylus with the
Mysteries and the man who only meant to show how it worked
like the fellow who let off the catapult Greek e deixai
Boulemos apheinai os o ton katapelten
I feel comfortably sure Gentlemen that in a previous course of
lectures On the Art of Writing unlike Aeschylus I divulged no
mysteries but I am troubled with speculations over that man and
the catapult because I really was trying to tell you how the
thing worked and Aristotle with a reticence which as Horace
afterwards noted may lend itself to obscurity tells us neither
what happened to that exponent of ballistics nor to the engine
itself nor to the other person My discharge such as it was at
any rate provoked another Professor emeritus learned
sagacious venerable to retort that the true business of a Chair
such as this is to instruct young men how to read rather than
how to write Well be it so I accept the challenge
I propose in this and some ensuing lectures to talk of the Art
and Practice of Reading particularly as applied to English
Literature to discuss on what ground and through what faculties
an Author and his Reader meet to enquire if or to what extent
Reading of the best Literature can be taught and supposing it to
be taught if or to what extent it can be examined upon with
maybe an interlude or two to beguile the way
II
The first thing then to be noted about the reading of English
with which alone I am concerned is that for Englishmen it has
been made by Act of Parliament compulsory
The next thing to be noted is that in our schools and Colleges
and Universities it has been made by Statute or in practice all
but impossible
The third step is obviousto reconcile what we cannot do with
what we must and to that aim I shall under your patience
direct this and the following lecture I shall be relieved at all
events and from the outset of the doubt by which many a
Professor here and elsewhere has been haunted I mean the doubt
whether there really is such a subject as that of which he
proposes to treat Anything that requires so much human ingenuity
as reading English in an English University must be an art
III
But I shall be met of course by the question How is the
reading of English made impossible at Cambridge and I pause
here on the edge of my subject to clear away that doubt
It is no fault of the University
The late Philip Gilbert Hamerton whom some remember as an
etcher wrote a book which he entitled as I think too
magniloquently The Intellectual Life He cast it in the form
of lettersTo an Author who kept very Irregular Hours To a
Young Etonian who thought of becoming a Cottonspinner To a
Young Gentleman who had firmly resolved never to wear anything
but a Grey Coat but Mr Hamerton couldnt quite have meant
that To a Lady of High Culture who found it difficult to
associate with persons of her Own Sex To a Young Gentleman of
Intellectual Tastes who without having as yet any Particular
Lady in View had expressed in a General Way his Determination
to get Married The volume is well worth reading In the first
letter of all addressed To a Young Man of Letters who worked
Excessively Mr Hamerton fishes up from his memory for
admonishment this salutary instance
A tradesman whose business affords an excellent outlet for
energetic bodily activity told me that having attempted in
addition to his ordinary work to acquire a foreign language
which seemed likely to be useful to him he had been obliged to
abandon it on account of alarming cerebral symptoms This man
has immense vigour and energy but the digestive functions in
this instance are sluggish However when he abandoned study
the cerebral inconveniences disappeared and have never
returned since
IV
Now we all know and understand and like that man for the
simple reason that he is every one of us
You or I say have to take the Modern Languages Tripos Section
A English in 19171 First of all and rightly it is
demanded of us that we show an acquaintance and something more
than a bowing acquaintance with Shakespeare Very well but next
we have to write a paper and answer questions on the outlines of
English Literature from 1350 to 1832almost 500 years and
next to write a paper and show particular knowledge of English
Literature between 1700 and 1785eightyfive years Next comes a
paper on passages from selected English verse and prose writings
the Statute discreetly avoids calling them literaturebetween
1200 and 1500 exclusive of Chaucer with questions on language
metre literary history and literary criticism then a paper on
Chaucer with questions on language metre literary history and
literary criticism lastly a paper on writing in the Wessex
dialect of Old English with questions on the cornet flute
harp sackbut language metre and literary history
Now if you were to qualify yourself for all this as a scholar
should and in two years you would certainly deserve to be
addressed by Mr Hamerton as A Young Man of Letters who worked
Excessively and to work excessively is not good for anyone
Yet on the other hand you are precluded from using for your
cerebral inconveniences the heroic remedy exhibited by Mr
Hamertons enterprising tradesman since on that method you would
not attain to the main object of your laudable ambition a
Cambridge degree
But the matter is very much worse than your Statute makes it out
Take one of the papers in which some actual acquaintance with
Literature is required the Special Period from 1700 to 1785 then
turn to your Cambridge History of English Literature and you
will find that the mere bibliography of those eightyfive years
occupies something like five or six hundred pagesfive or six
hundred pages of titles and authors in simple enumeration The
brain reels it already suffers cerebral inconveniences But
stretch the list back to Chaucer back through Chaucer to those
alleged prose writings in the Wessex dialect then forward from
1785 to Wordsworth to Byron to Dickens Carlyle Tennyson
Browning Meredith even to this year in which literature still
lives and engenders and the brain if not too giddy indeed
stands as Satan stood on the brink of Chaos
Pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
He had to cross
and sees itself with him now plumbing a vast vacuity and anon
nighfoundered treading the crude consistence
The whole business of reading English Literature in two years to
know it in any reputable sense of the wordlet alone your
learning to write Englishis in short impossible And the
framers of the Statute recognising this have very sensibly
compromised by setting you to work on such things as the
Outlines of English Literature which are not Literature at all
but are only what some fellow has to say about it hastily
summarising his estimates of many works of which on a generous
computation he has probably read onefifth and by examining you
on what was it all language metre literary history and
literary criticism which again are not Literature or at least
as a Greek would say in his idiom escape their own notice being
Literature For English Literature as I take it is that which
sundry men and women have written memorably in English about
Life And so I come to my subjectthe art of reading that
which is Literature
V
I shall take leave to leap into it over another mans back or
rather over two mens backs No doubt it has happened to many of
you to pick up in a happy moment some book or pamphlet or copy of
verse which just says the word you have unconsciously been
listening for almost craving to speak for yourself and so sends
you off hotfoot on the trail And if you have had that
experience it may also have happened to you that after ranging
you returned on the track like faithful hound returning in
gratitude or to refresh the scent and that picking up the book
again you found it no such wonderful book after all or that
some of the magic had faded by process of the change in yourself
which itself had originated But the word was spoken
Such a bookpamphlet I may call it so small it wasfell into
my hands some ten years ago The Aims of Literary Studyno
very attractive titleby Dr Corson a distinguished American
Professor and let me say that for something more than tensay
for twentyyears much of the most thoughtful as well as the most
thorough work upon English comes to us from America I find as
I handle again the small duodecimo volume that my own thoughts
have taken me a little wide perhaps a little astray from its
suggestions But for loyaltys sake I shall start just where Dr
Corson started with a passage from Brownings A Death in the
Desert supposed you will remember
Supposed of Pamphylax the Antiochene
narrating the death of St John the Evangelist John of Patmos
the narrative interrupted by this gloss
This is the doctrine he was wont to teach
How divers persons witness in each man
Three souls which make up one soul first to wit
A soul of each and all the bodily parts
Seated therein which works and is What Does
And has the use of earth and ends the man
Downward but tending upward for advice
Grows into and again is grown into
By the next soul which seated in the brain
Useth the first with its collected use
And feeleth thinketh willethis What Knows
Which duly tending upward in its turn
Grows into and again is grown into
By the last soul that uses both the first
Subsisting whether they assist or no
And constituting mans self is What Is
And leans upon the former
Mark the word Gentlemen leans upon the formerleaning
back as it were felt by him on this very man who had leaned
on Christs bosom being loved
And leans upon the former makes it play
As that played off the first and tending up
Holds is upheld by God and ends the man
Upward in that dread point of intercourse
Nor needs a place for it returns to Him
What Does What Knows What Is three souls one man
I give the glossa of Theotypas
What Does What Knows What Isthere is no mistaking what
Browning means nor in what degrees of hierarchy he places this
that and the other Does it not strike you how curiously men
today with their minds perverted by hate are inverting that
orderall the highest value set on What DoesWhat Knows
suddenly seen to be of importance but only as important in
feeding the guns perfecting explosives collaring tradeall in
the service of What Does of Get on or Get Out of
Efficiency no one stopping to think that Efficiency ismust
bea relative term Efficient for whatfor What Does What
Knows or perchance after all for What Is No banish the
humanities and throw everybody into practical science not into
that study of natural science which can never conflict with the
humanities since it seeks discovery for the pure sake of truth
or charitably to alleviate mans lot
Sweetly rather to ease loose and bind
As need requires this frail fallen humankind
but to invent what will be commercially serviceable in besting
your neighbour or in gassing him or in slaughtering him neatly
and wholesale But still the whisper not ridiculous in its day
will assert itself that What Is comes first holding and
upheld by God still through the market clamour for a Business
Government will persist the voice of Plato murmuring that after
all the best form of government is government by good men and
the voice of some small man faintly protesting But I dont want
to be governed by business men because I know them and without
asking much of life I have a hankering to die with a shirt on my
back
VI
But let us postpone What Is for a moment and deal with What
Does and What Knows They too of course have had their
oppositions and the very meaning of a University such as
Cambridgeits fons its origo its Greek to ti en einai
was to assert What Knows against What Does in a medieval
world pranced over by menatarms Normans English Burgundians
Scots Ancillary to Theology which then had a meaning vastly
different from its meaning today the University tended as
portress of the gate of knowledgeof such knowledge as the
Church required encouraged or permittedand kept the flag of
intellectual life as I may put it flying above that gate and
over the passing throngs of doers and mailedfisters The
University was a Seat of Learning the Colleges as they sprang
up were Houses of Learning
But note this which in their origin and still in the frame of
their constitution differentiates Oxford and Cambridge from all
their ancient sisters and rivals These two and no third I
believe in Europe were corporations of Teachers existing for
Teachers governed by Teachers In a Scottish University the
students by vote choose their Rector but here or at Oxford no
undergraduate no Bachelor counts at all in the government both
remaining alike in statu pupillari until qualified as Masters
Magistri Mark the word and mark also the title of one who
obtained what in those days would be the highest of degrees but
yet gave him no voting strength above a Master He was a
ProfessorSanctae Theologiae Professor To this day every
country clergyman who comes up to Cambridge to record his
nonplacet does so by virtue of his capacity to teach what he
learned herein theory that is Scholars were included in
College foundations on a sort of pupilteachersupply system
living in rooms with the lordly masters and valeting them for
the privilege of reading with them We keep to this day the
pleasant old form of words Now for various reasonsone of
which because it is closely germane to my subject I shall
particularly examineOxford and Cambridge while conserving
almost intact their medieval frame of government with a hundred
other survivals which Time but makes through endurance more
endearing have insensibly as it were and across it must be
confessed intervals of sloth and gross dereliction of duty
added a new function to the cultivation of learningthat of
furnishing out of youth a succession of men capable of fulfilling
high offices in Church and State
Some may regret this I think many of us must regret that a
deeper tincture of learning is not required of the average
passman or injected into him perforce But speaking roughly about
fact I should say that while we elders up here are required
nay presumed to know certain things we aim that our young men
shall be of a certain kind and I see no cause to disown a
sentence in the very first lecture I had the honour of reading
before youThe man we are proud to send forth from our Schools
will be remarkable less for something he can take out of his
wallet and exhibit for knowledge than for being something
and that something recognisable for a man of unmistakable
intellectual breeding whose trained judgment we can trust to
choose the better and reject the worse
The reasons which have led our older Universities to deflect
their functions whether for good or ill so far from their first
purpose are complicated if not many Once admit young men in
large numbers and youth I call any Dean or Tutor to witness
must be compromised with will construe the laws of its seniors
in its own way now and then breaking them and will inevitably
end by getting something of its own way The growth of
gymnastic the insensible gravitation of the elderly towards
Fennersthere to snatch a fearful joy and explain that the walk
was good for them the Union and other debating societies
College rivalries the festivities of May Week the invasion of
women students all these may have helped But I must dwell
discreetly on one compelling and obvious causethe increased and
increasing unwieldiness of Knowledge And that is the main
trouble as I guess
VII
Let us look it fair in the face because it is the main practical
difficulty with which I propose that in succeeding lectures we
grapple Against Knowledge I have as the light cynic observed of
a certain ladys past only one serious objectionthat there is
so much of it There is indeed so much of it that if with the
best will in the world you devoted yourself to it as a mere
scholar you could not possibly digest its accumulated and still
accumulating stores As Sir Thomas Elyot wrote in the 16th
century using you will observe the very word of Mr Hamertons
energetic but fedup tradesman Inconveniences always doe
happen by ingurgitation and excessive feedings An old
schoolmaster and a poetMr James Rhoades late of Sherborne
comments in words which I will quote being unable to better
them
This is no less true of the mind than of the body I do not
know that a wellinformed man as such is more worthy of
regard than a wellfed one The brain indeed is a nobler
organ than the stomach but on that very account is the less
to be excused for indulging in repletion The temptation I
confess is greater because for the brain the banquet stands
ever spread before our eyes and is unhappily as
indestructible as the widows meal and oil
Only think what would become of us if the physical food
by which our bodies subsist instead of being consumed by
the eater was passed on intact by every generation to the
next with the superadded hoards of all the ages the earths
productive power meanwhile increasing year by year
beneath the unflagging hand of Science till as Comus
says she
would be quite surcharged with her own weight
And strangled with her waste fertility
Should we rather not pull down our barns and build
smaller and make bonfires of what they would not hold
And yet with regard to Knowledge the very opposite of
this is what we do We store the whole religiously and that
though not twice alone as with the bees in Virgil but
scores of times in every year is the teeming produce
gathered in And then we put a fearful pressure on
ourselves and others to gorge of it as much as ever we can
hold
Facit indignatio versus My author gathering heat puts it
somewhat dithyrambically but there you have it Gentlemen
If you crave for Knowledge the banquet of Knowledge grows and
groans on the board until the finer appetite sickens If still
putting all your trust in Knowledge you try to dodge the
difficulty by specialising you produce a brain bulging out
inordinately on one side on the other cut flat down and mostly
paralytic at that and in short so long as I hold that the
Creator has an idea of a man so long shall I be sure that no
uneven specialist realises it The real tragedy of the Library at
Alexandria was not that the incendiaries burned immensely but
that they had neither the leisure nor the taste to discriminate
VIII
The old schoolmaster whom I quoted just now goes on
I believe if the truth were known men would be
astonished at the small amount of learning with which a
high degree of culture is compatible In a moment of enthusiasm
I ventured once to tell my English set that if they could
really master the ninth book of Paradise Lost so as to rise
to the height of its great argument and incorporate all its
beauties in themselves they would at one blow by virtue
of that alone become highly cultivated men More and
more various learning might raise them to the same height
by different paths but could hardly raise them higher
Here let me interpose and quote the last three lines of that
Bookthree lines only simple unornamented but for every man
and every woman who have dwelt together since our first parents
in mere statement how wise
Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours but neither selfcondemning
And of their vain contest appeard no end
A parent afterwards told me my schoolmaster adds that his son
went home and so buried himself in the book that food and sleep
that day had no attraction for him Next morning I need hardly
say the difference in his appearance was remarkable he had
outgrown all his intellectual clothes
The end of this story strikes me I confess as rapid and may be
compared with that of the growth of Delian Apollo in the Homeric
hymn but we may agree that in reading it is not quantity so
much that tells as quality and thoroughness of digestion
IX
What DoesWhat KnowsWhat Is
I am not likely to depreciate to you the value of What Does
after spending my first twelve lectures up here on the art and
practice of Writing encouraging you to do this thing which I
daily delight in trying to do as God forbid that anyone should
hint a slightening word of what our sons and brothers are doing
just now and doing for us But Peace being the normal condition
of mans activity I look around me for a vindication of what is
noblest in What Does and am content with a passage from George
Eliots poem Stradivarius the gist of which is that God
himself might conceivably make better fiddles than Stradivaris
but by no means certainly since as a fact God orders his best
fiddles of Stradivari Says the great workman
God be praised
Antonio Stradivari has an eye
That winces at false work and loves the true
With hand and arm that play upon the tool
As willingly as any singing bird
Sets him to sing his morning roundelay
Because he likes to sing and likes the song
Then Naldo Tis a pretty kind of fame
At best that comes of making violins
And saves no masses either Thou wilt go
To purgatory none the less
But he
Twere purgatory here to make them ill
And for my famewhen any master holds
Twixt chin and hand a violin of mine
He will be glad that Stradivari lived
Made violins and made them of the best
The masters only know whose work is good
They will choose mine and while God gives them skill
I give them instruments to play upon
God choosing me to help Him
What Were God
At fault for violins thou absent
Yes
He were at fault for Stradivaris work
Why many hold Giuseppes
violins As good as thine
May be they are different
His quality declines he spoils his hand
With overdrinking But were his the best
He could not work for two My work is mine
And heresy or not if my hand slacked
I should rob Godsince He is fullest good
Leaving a blank instead of violins
I say not God Himself can make mans best
Without best men to help him
Tis God gives skill
But not without mens hands He could not make
Antonio Stradivaris violins
Without Antonio Get thee to thy easel
So much then for What Does I do not depreciate it
X
Neither do I depreciatein Cambridge save the markWhat
Knows All knowledge is venerable and I suppose you will find
the last vindication of the scholars life at its baldest in
Brownings A Grammarians Funeral
Others mistrust and say But time escapes
Live now or never
He said Whats time Leave Now for dog and apes
Man has Forever
Back to his book then deeper drooped his head
Calculus racked him
Leaden before his eyes grew dross of lead
Tussis attacked him
So with the throttling hands of death at strife
Ground he at grammar
Still thro the rattle parts of speech were rife
While he could stammer
He settled Hotis businesslet it be
Properly based Oun
