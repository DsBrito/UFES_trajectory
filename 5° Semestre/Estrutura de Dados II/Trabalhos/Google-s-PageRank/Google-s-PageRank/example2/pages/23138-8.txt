considering them as a reflection upon the whole of the Union all I can
say is that they must and will be annoyed
The answer made to the lady who was wrathy about the pigtail was
Captain M has stated it to be a custom in one State  Have you ever
been in that State
No I have not replied the lady but I have never heard of it  So
then on a vast continent extending almost from the Poles to the
Equator because one individual one mere mite of creation among the
millions who are but a fraction of the population which the country
will support has not heard of what passes thousands of miles from her
abode therefore it cannot be true  Instead of cavilling let the
American read mark learn and inwardly digest all that I have already
said and all that I intend to say in these volumes and although the
work was not written for them but for my own countrymen they will find
that I have done them friendly service
There is much comprehended in the simple word travelling which heads
this chapter and it is by no means an unimportant subject as the
degree of civilisation of a country and many important peculiarities
bearing strongly upon the state of society are to be gathered from the
high road and the variety of entertainment for man and horse and I
think that my remarks on this subject will throw as much light upon
American society as will be found in any chapter which I have written
In a country abounding as America does with rivers and railroads and
where locomotion by steam wherever it can be applied supersedes every
other means of conveyance it is not to be expected that the roads will
be remarkably good they are however in consequence of the excellent
arrangements of the townships and counties in the Eastern States as
good and much better than could be expected  The great objection to
them is that they are not levelled but follow the undulations of the
country so that you have a variety of short steep ascents and descents
which are very trying to the carriagesprings and very fatiguing to the
traveller  Of course in a new country you must expect to fall in with
the delightful varieties of Corduroy etcetera but wherever the
country is settled and the population sufficient to pay the expense
the roads in America may be said to be as good as under circumstances
could possibly be expected  There are one or two roads I believe not
more which are government roads but in general the expense of the
roads is defrayed by the States
But before I enter into any remarks upon the various modes of
travelling in America it may be as well to say a few words upon the
horses which are remarkably good in the United States they appear to
be more hardy and have much better hoofs than ours in England
throwing a shoe therefore is not of the same consequence as it is with
us for a horse will go twenty miles afterwards with little injury  In
Virginia and Kentucky the horses are almost all thoroughbred and from
the best English stockThe distances run in racing are much longer
than ours and speed without bottom is useless
The Americans are very fond of fast trotting horses I do not refer to
rackers as they term horses that trot before and gallop behind but
fair trotters and they certainly have a description of horse that we
could not easily match in England  At New York the Third Avenue as
they term it is the general rendezvous I once went out there mounted
upon Paul Pry who was once considered the fastest horse in America at
his full speed he performed a mile in two minutes and thirty seconds
equal to twentyfour miles per hour  He took me at this devil of a pace
as far as Hell Gate not wishing to intrude I pulled up there and
went home again  A pair of horses in harness were pointed out to me who
could perform the mile in two minutes fifty seconds  They use here
light fourwheeled vehicles which they call wagons with a seat in the
front for two persons and room for your luggage behind and in these
wagons with a pair of horses they think nothing of trotting them
seventy or eighty miles in a day at the speed of twelve miles an hour
I have seen the horses come in and they did not appear to suffer from
the fatigue  You seldom see a horse bent forward but they are all
daisy cutters
The gentlemen of New York give very high prices for fast horses 1000
dollars is not by any means an uncommon price  In a country where time
is every thing they put a proportionate value upon speed  Paul Pry is
a tall grey horse now thirteen years old to look at he would not
fetch 10 poundsthe English omnibuses would refuse him
Talking about omnibuses those of New York and the other cities in
America are as good and as well regulated as those of Paris the larger
ones have four horses  Not only their omnibuses but their hackney
coaches are very superior to those in London the latter are as clean as
private carriages and with the former there is no swearing no
dislocating the arms of poor females hauling them from one omnibus to
the otherbut civility without servility
The American stagecoaches are such as experience has found out to be
most suitable to the American roads and you have not ridden in them
five miles before you long for the delightful springing of four horses
upon the level roads of England  They are something between an English
stage see note 1 and a French diligence built with all the panels
open on account of the excessive heat of the summer months  In wet
weather these panels are covered with leather aprons which are fixed on
with battons a very insufficient protection in the winter as the wind
blows through the intermediate spaces whistling into your ears and
rendering it more piercing than if all was open  Moreover they are no
protection against the rain or snow both of which find their way in to
you  The coach has three seats to receive nine passengers those on
the middle seat leaning back upon a strong and broad leather brace
which runs across  This is very disagreeable as the centre passengers
when the panels are closed deprive the others of the light and air from
the windows  But the most disagreeable feeling arises from the body of
the coach not being upon springs but hung upon leather braces running
under it and supporting it on each side and when the roads are bad or
you ascend or rapidly descend the pitches as they term short hills the
motion is very similar to that of being tossed in a blanket often
throwing you up to the top of the coach so as to flatten your hatif
not your head
The drivers are very skilful although they are generally young men
indeed often mere boysfor they soon better themselves as they advance
in life  Very often they drive six in hand and if you are upset it is
generally more the fault of the road than of the driver  I was upset
twice in one half hour when I was travelling in the winter time but the
snow was very deep at the time and no one thinks anything of an upset
in America  More serious accidents do however sometimes happen  When
I was in New Hampshire a neglected bridge broke down and precipitated
coach horses and passengers into a torrent which flowed into the
Connecticut river  Some of the passengers were drowned  Those who were
saved sued the township and recovered damages but these mischances
must be expected in a new country  The great annoyance of these public
conveyances is that neither the proprietor or driver consider
themselves the servants of the public a stagecoach is a speculation by
which as much money is to be made as possible by the proprietors and as
the driver never expects or demands a fee from the passengers they or
their comforts are no concern of his  The proprietors do not consider
that they are bound to keep faith with the public nor do they care
about any complaints
The stages which run from Cincinnati to the eastward are very much
interfered with when the Ohio river is full of water as the travellers
prefer the steamboats but the very moment that the water is so low on
the Ohio that the steamboats cannot ascend the river up to Wheeling
double the price is demanded by the proprietors of the coaches  They
are quite regardless as to the opinion or goodwill of the public they
do not care for either all they want is their money and they are
perfectly indifferent whether you break your neck or not  The great
evil arising from this state of hostility as you may almost call it is
the disregard of life which renders travelling so dangerous in America
You are completely at the mercy of the drivers who are generally
speaking very goodtempered but sometimes quite the contrary and I
have often been amused with the scenes which have taken place between
them and the passengers  As for myself when the weather permitted it
I invariably went outside which the Americans seldom do and was always
very good friends with the drivers  They are full of local information
and often very amusing  There is however a great difference in the
behaviour of the drivers of the mails and coaches which are timed by
the postoffice and others which are not  If beyond his time the
driver is mulcted by the proprietors and when dollars are in the
question there is an end to all urbanity and civility
A gentleman of my acquaintance was in a mail which was behind time and
the driver was proceeding at such a furious pace that one jerk threw a
lady to the top of the coach and the teeth of her comb entering her
head she fainted with pain  The passengers called out to the driver to
stop  What for  That last jerk has struck the lady and she has
fainted  Oh thats all  Well I reckon Ill give her another jerk
which will bring her to again  Strange to say he prophesied right
the next jerk was very violent and the lady recovered her senses
Mr E an employe of the American government was travelling in the
state of Indianathe passengers had slept at an inn and the coach was
ready at the door but Mr E had not quite finished his toilet the
driver dispatched the barkeeper for him and Mr E sent word he would
be down immediately
What is he about said the driver impatiently to the barkeeper when
he came down again
Cleaning his teeth
Cleaning his teeth roared the driver indignantly by the  and
away went the horses at a gallop leaving Mr E behind
The other passengers remonstrated but without avail they told him that
Mr E was charged with government despatcheshe didnt care at last
one of them offered him a dollar if he would go back  They had
proceeded more than a mile before the offer was made the man
immediately wheeled his horses round and returned to the inn
The Rev  Mr Reid gives an anecdote very characteristic of American
stagecoach travelling and proving how little the convenience of the
public is cared for
When we stopped at Lowell to change horses a female wished to secure a
place onward  We were already as the phrase is more than full we had
nine persons and two children which are made to go for nothing except
in the waybill  Our saucy driver opened the door and addressing two
men who with us would have been outside passengersnow I say I
want one of you to ride with me and let a lady have your seat  The
men felt they were addressed by a superior but kept their places
Come I say he continued you shall have a good buffalo and
umbrel and nothing will hurt you  Still they kept their places and
refused him  His lordship was offended and ready to lay hands on one
of them but checking himself exclaimed Well if I cant get you
out hang it if Ill take you on till one of you gets out  And there
we stood for some time and he gained his point at last and in civiller
terms by persuading the persons on the middle seat to receive the lady
so that we had now twelve inside
I once myself was in a stagecoach and found that the window glasses
had been taken out I mentioned this to the driver as it rained in very
fastWell now replied he I reckon youd better ax the
proprietors my business is to drive the coach  And that was all the
comfort I could procure  As for speaking to them about stopping or
driving slow it is considered as an unwarrantable interference
I recollect an Englishman at New York telling me that when in the
Eastern States he had expressed a wish to go a little fasterOh
said the driver you do do you well wait a moment and Ill go
faster than you like  The fellow drove very slow where the road was
good but as soon as he came to a bad piece he put his horses to the
gallop and as my friend said they were so tossed and tumbled about
that they hardly knew where they were  Is that fast enough Mister
said the driver leering in at the couch window
As for stopping they will stop to talk to any one on the road about the
price of the markets the news or any thing else and the same
accommodation is cheerfully given to any passenger who has any business
to transact on the way  The Americans are accustomed to it and the
passengers never raise any objections  There is a spirit of
accommodation arising from their natural good temper note 2
I was once in a coach when the driver pulled up and entered a small
house on the road side after he had been there some time as it was not
an inn I expressed my wonder what he was about  I guess I can tell
you said a man who was standing by the coach and overheard me
theres a pretty girl in that house and hes doing a bit of courting
I expect  Such was the fact the passengers laughed and waited for
him very patiently  He remained about threequarters of an hour and
then came out  The time was no doubt to him very short but to us it
appeared rather tedious
Mrs Jamieson in her last work says One dark night I remember as
the sleet and rain were falling fast and our Extra was slowly dragged
by wretched brutes of horses through what seemed to me Sloughs of
Despond some package ill stowed on the roof which in the American
stages presents no restingplace for man or box fell off  The driver
alighted to fish it out of the mud  As there was some delay a
gentleman seated opposite to me put his head out of window to inquire
the cause to whom the drivers voice replied in an angry tone I say
you mister dont you sit jabbering there but lend a hand to heave
these things aboard  To my surprise the gentleman did not appear
struck by the insolence of this summons but immediately jumped out and
rendered his assistance  This is merely the manner of the people
The driver intended no insolence nor was it taken as such and my
fellowtravellers could not help laughing at my surprise
I have mentioned these little anecdotes as they may amuse the reader
but it must be understood that generally speaking the drivers are very
goodnatured and obliging and the passengers very accommodating to each
other and submitting with a good grace to what cannot be ameliorated
Note 1  Miss Martineau in her work speaks of that most delightful of
all conveyancesan American stagecoach but Miss M is so very peculiar
in her ideas that I am surprised at nothing that she says  I will
however quote the Reverend Mr Reid against her
I had no sooner begun to enter the coach than splash went my foot in
mud and water  I exclaimed with surprise  Soon be dry sir was the
reply while he withdrew the light that I might not explore the cause
of complaint  The fact was that the vehicle like the hotel and
steamboat was not watertight and the rain had found an entrance
There was indeed in this coach as in most others a provision in the
bottom of holes to let off both water and dirt but here the dirt had
become mud and thickened about the orifices so as to prevent escape
I found I was the only passenger the morning was damp and chilly the
state of the coach added to the sensation and I eagerly looked about
for some means of protection  I drew up the wooden windows out of five
small panes of glass in the sashes three were broken  I endeavoured to
secure the curtains two of them had most of the ties broken and
flapped in ones face  There was no help in the coach so I looked to
myself  I made the best use I could of my garments and put myself as
snugly as I could in the corner of a stage meant to accommodate nine
persons  My situation just then was not among the most cheerful  I
could see nothing every where I could feel the wind drawn in upon me
and as for sounds I had the calls of the driver the screeching of the
wheels and the song of the bullfrog for my entertainmentRev  Mr
Reids Tour vol  I page 100Very delightful indeed
Note 2  This spirit of accommodation produces what would at first
appear to be rudeness but is not intended for it  When you travel or
indeed when walking the streets in the Western country if you have a
cigar in your mouth a man will come upBeg pardon stranger and
whips your cigar out of your mouth lights his own and then returns
yours  I thought it rather cool at first but as I found it was the
practice I invariably did the same whenever I needed a light
VOLUME ONE CHAPTER TWO
TRAVELLING
In making my observations upon the railroad and steamboat travelling
in the United States I shall point out some facts with which the reader
must be made acquainted  The Americans are a restless locomotive
people whether for business or pleasure they are ever on the move in
their own country and they move in masses  There is but one
conveyance it may be said for every class of people the coach
railroad or steamboat as well as most of the hotels being open to
all the consequence is that the society is very much mixedthe
millionaire the welleducated woman of the highest rank the senator
the member of Congress the farmer the emigrant the swindler and the
pickpocket are all liable to meet together in the same vehicle of
conveyance  Some conventional rules were therefore necessary and those
rules have been made by public opiniona power to which all must submit
in America  The one most important and without which it would be
impossible to travel in such a gregarious way is an universal deference
and civility shewn to the women who may in consequence travel without
protection all over the United States without the least chance of
annoyance or insult  This deference paid to the sex is highly
creditable to the Americans it exists from one end of the Union to the
other indeed in the Southern and more lawless States it is even more
chivalric than in the more settled  Let a female be ever so
indifferently clad whatever her appearance may be still it is
sufficient that she is a female she has the first accommodation and
until she has it no man will think of himself  But this deference is
not only shewn in travelling but in every instance  An English lady
told me that wishing to be present at the inauguration of Mr Van
Buren by some mistake she and her daughters alighted from the carriage
at the wrong entrance and in attempting to force their way through a
dense crowd were nearly crushed to death  This was perceived and the
word was givenmake room for the ladies  The whole crowd as if by
one simultaneous effort compressed itself to the right and left
locking themselves together to meet the enormous pressure and made a
wide lane through which they passed with ease and comfort  It
reminded me of the Israelites passing through the Red Sea with the wall
of waters on each side of them observed the lady  In any other
country we must have been crushed to death
When I was on board one of the steamboats an American asked one of the
ladies to what she would like to be helped  She replied to some
turkey which was within reach and off of which a passenger had just
cut the wing and transferred it to his own plate  The American who had
received the ladys wishes immediately pounced with his fork upon the
wing of the turkey and carried it off to the young ladys plate the
only explanation given a lady Sir was immediately admitted as
sufficient
The authority of the captain of a steamboat is never disputed if it
were the offender would be landed on the beach  I was on board of a
steamboat when at tea time a young man sat down with his hat on
You are in the company of ladies sir observed the captain very
civilly and I must request you to take your hat off
Are you the captain of the boat observed the young man in a sulky
tone
Yes sir I am
Well then I suppose I must growled the passenger as he obeyed
But if the stewards who are men of colour were to attempt to enforce
the order they would meet with such a rebuff as I have myself heard
given
If its the captains orders let the captain come and give them  Im
not going to obey a Nigger like you
Perhaps it is owing to this deference to the sex that you will observe
that the Americans almost invariably put on their best clothes when they
travel such is the case whatever may be the cause and the ladies in
America travelling or not are always well if not expensively dressed
They dont all swap bonnets as the two young ladies did in the
stagecoach in Vermont
But notwithstanding the decorum so well preserved as I have mentioned
there are some annoyances to be met with from gregarious travelling
One is that occasionally a family of interesting young citizens who are
suffering from the whoopingcough smallpox or any other complaint
are brought on board in consequence of the medical gentlemen having
recommended change of air  Of course the other children or even
adults may take the infection but they are not refused admittance upon
such trifling grounds the profits of the steam boat must not be
interfered with
Of all travelling I think that by railroad the most intriguing
especially in America  After a certain time the constant coughing of
the locomotive the dazzling of the vision from the rapidity with which
objects are passed the sparks and ashes which fly in your face and on
your clothes become very annoying your only consolation is the speed
with which you are passing over the ground
The railroads in America are not so well made as in England and are
therefore more dangerous but it must be remembered that at present
nothing is made in America but to last a certain time they go to the
exact expense considered necessary and no further they know that in
twenty years they will be better able to spend twenty dollars than one
now  The great object is to obtain quick returns for the outlay and
except in few instances durability or permanency is not thought of
One great cause of disasters is that the railroads are not fenced on
the sides so as to keep the cattle off them and it appears as if the
cattle who range the woods are very partial to take their naps on the
roads probably from their being drier than the other portions of the
soil  It is impossible to say how many cows have been cut into atoms by
the trains in America but the frequent accidents arising from these
causes has occasioned the Americans to invent a sort of shovel attached
to the front of the locomotive which takes up a cow tossing her off
right or left  At every fifteen miles of the railroads there are
refreshment rooms the cars stop all the doors are thrown open and out
rush the passengers like boys out of school and crowd round the tables
to solace themselves with pies patties cakes hardboiled eggs ham
custards and a variety of railroad luxuries too numerous to mention
The bell rings for departure in they all hurry with their hands and
mouths full and off they go again until the next stopping place
induces them to relieve the monotony of the journey by masticating
without being hungry
The Utica railroad is the best in the United States  The general
average of speed is from fourteen to sixteen miles an hour but on the
Utica they go much faster  See note 1 A gentleman narrated to me a
singular specimen of the ruling passion which he witnessed on an
occasion when the railcars were thrown off the road and nearly one
hundred people killed or injured in a greater or less degree
On the side of the road lay a man with his leg so severely fractured
that the bone had been forced through the skin and projected outside
his trowsers  Over him hung his wife with the utmost solicitude the
blood running down from a severe cut received on her head and kneeling
by his side was his sister who was also much injured  The poor women
were lamenting over him and thinking nothing of their own hurts and
he it appears was also thinking nothing about his injury but only
lamenting the delay which would be occasioned by it
Oh my dear dear Isaac what can be done with your leg exclaimed the
wife in the deepest distress
What will become of my leg cried the man  Whats to become of my
business I should like to know
Oh dear brother said the other female dont think about your
business now think of getting cured
Think of getting curedI must think how the bills are to be met and I
not there to take them up  They will be presented as sure as I lie
here
Oh never mind the bills dear husbandthink of your precious leg
Not mind the bills but I must mind the billsmy credit will be
ruined
Not when they know what has happened brother  Oh dear dearthat
leg that leg
Dn the leg whats to become of my business groaned the man
falling on his back from excess of pain
Now this was a specimen of true commercial spirit  If this man had not
been nailed to the desk he might have been a hero
I shall conclude this chapter with an extract from an American author
which will give some idea of the indifference as to loss of life in the
United States
Every now and then is a tale of railroad disaster in some part of the
country at inclined planes or intersecting points or by running off
the track making splinters of the cars and of mens bones and
locomotives have been known to encounter head to head like two rams
fighting  A little while previous to the writing of these lines a
locomotive and tender shot down the inclined plain at Philadelphia like
a falling star  A woman with two legs broken by this accident was put
into an omnibus to be carried to the hospital but the driver in his
speculations coolly replied to a man who asked why he did not go on
that he was waiting for a full load
Note 1  The railroads finished in America in 1835 amounted in length to
1600 miles those in progress and not yet complete to 1270 miles
more  The canals completed were in length 2500 miles unfinished 687
miles
VOLUME ONE CHAPTER THREE

The most general the most rapid the most agreeable and at the same
time the most dangerous of American travelling is by steam boats  It
will be as well to give the reader an idea of the extent of this

Voice from America
Many of the largest of these rivers are at present running through
desertsothers possess but a scanty population on their banks but as
the west fills up they will be teeming with life and the harvest of
industry will freight many more hundreds of vessels than those which at
present disturb their waters
The Americans have an idea that they are very far ahead of us in steam
navigation a great error which I could not persuade them of  In the
first place their machinery is not by any means equal to ours in the
next they have no seagoing steam vessels which after all is the great
desideratum of steam navigation  Even in the number and tonnage of
their mercantile steam vessels they are not equal to us as I shall
presently show nor have they yet arrived to that security in steam
navigation which we have
The return of vessels belonging to the Mercantile Steam Marine of Great
Britain made by the Commissioners on the Report of steamvessel
accidents in 1839 is number of vessels 810 tonnage 157840 horse
power 63250
Mr Levi Woodburys Report to Congress in December 1838 states the
number of American steam vessels to be 800 and the tonnage to be
155473 horse power 57019
It is but fair to state that the Americans have the credit of having
sent the first steam vessel across the Atlantic  In 1819 a steam
vessel built at New York crossed from Savannah to Liverpool in
twentysix days
The number of seagoing steam vessels in England is two hundred and
eightytwo while in the United States they have not more than ten at
the outside calculation  In the size of our vessels also we are far
superior to them  I here insert a table shewing the dimensions of our
largest vessels as given in the Report to the House of Commons and
another of the largest American vessels collected from the Report of Mr
Levi Woodbury to Congress
Table shewing some of the Dimensions of the Hull and Machinery of the
five largest ships yet built or building
Table to be added in a later edition
But the point on which we are so vastly superior to the Americans is in
our steam vessels of war  They have but one in the United States named
the Fulton the Second  The following is a list of those belonging to
the Government of Great Britain with their tonnage
