RAMBLES OF AN ARCHAOLOGIST AMONG OLD BOOKS AND IN OLD PLACES
CHAPTER I
Long after the extinction of the practical artpower evolved from the
masterminds of Greece and Rome though rudely shattered by the northern
tribes it failed not to enforce from them an admission of its grandeur
Loving as all rude nations do so much of art as goes to the adornment
of life they also felt that there was a still higher aim in the
enlarged spirit of classic invention It is recorded that one of these
ancient chieftains gazed thoughtfully in Rome upon the noble statuary of
the fallen race and declared it the work of men superior to any then
remaining and that all the creations of such lost power should be
carefully preserved The quaint imaginings of uncivilised
artworkmanship bore the impress of a strong but ruder nature
elaboration took the place of elegance magnificence that of grandeur
Slowly as centuries evolved the artstudent came back to the purity of
antique taste but the process was a tardy one each era preferring the
impress of its own ideas and though the grotesque contortions of
mediAval statuary be occasionally modified by the influence of better
art on the Gothic mind it was not till the revival of the study of
classic literature in the fifteenth century that men began to inquire
into the art of the past ages and endeavoured to obtain somewhat of its
sacred fire for the use of their own time The study was rewarded and
the style popularly known as that of the Renaissance rapidly spread
its influence over the world of art sanctioned by the favour of such
masterminds as Raphael and the great men of his era
Illustration Fig 1
It was not however to be expected that any style should be
resuscitated in all its purity without the admixture of some peculiarity
emanating from the art which adopted it and which was more completely
the mode of the era The Renaissance is therefore a Gothic
classicality engrafting classic form and freedom on the decorative
quaintnesses of the middle ages Fig 1 is as pertinent a specimen as
could be obtained of this characteristic the Greek volute and the Roman
foliage are made to combine with the hideous inventions of monkery the
grotesque heads that are exhibited on the most sacred edifices and
which are simply the stone records of the strife and rivalry that
prevailed between monks and friars up to the date of the Reformation
and are therefore of great value to the student of ecclesiology and
ecclesiastical history In this instance they seem to typify death and
hell over whom the Saviour was victorious by his mortal agony the
emblems of which occupy the central shield and tell with much simple
force the story of manas redemption MediAval art has not unfrequently
the merit of much condensation of thought always particularly visible
in its choice of types by which to express in a simple form a precise
religious idea at once appealing to the mind of the spectator and
bringing out a train of thought singularly diffuse when its slight
origin is considered
Illustration Fig 2
The easy applicability of the revived art to the taste for fanciful
display which characterised the fifteenth century led to its universal
adoption in decoration but the wilder imaginings of the living artist
always tampered with the grand features of the design The panel Fig
2 is an instance The griffins have lost their classic character and
have assumed the Gothic the foliations are also subjected to the same
process The design is however on the whole an excellent example of
the mode in which the style appeared as a decoration in the houses of
the nobility whose love of heraldic display was indulged by the wood
carver in panelled rooms rich with similar compartments
Illustration Fig 3
Heraldry with all its adjuncts had become so great a passion with the
noble that the invention of the artist and student was taxed for badges
and mottoes by noble families The custom flourished most in Italy
where the impresa of a noble house spoke to the eye at once whether
it was found on a swordhilt or over a churchdoor We give as an
instance in Fig 3 that adopted by the bold Dukes of Burgundy
sovereigns in their own dominions and exciting much terror of rivalry
in the minds of the kings of France themselves Their badge or
impresa was indicative of their rude power a couple of knotted
clubs saltierwise help to support a somewhat conventional figure of
the steel used for striking the flint to produce fire the whole
surmounted by the crown and intended to indicate by analogous
reflection the vigour of the ducal house As a bold defiance a rival
house adopted the rabot or carpenteras plane by which they indicated
their determination to smooth by force the formidable knots from the
clubs of the proud rulers of Burgundy
Illustration Fig 4
Illustration Fig 5
The art of enamelling which had reached a high degree of perfection in
the Roman era was refined upon in the middle ages and ultimately its
character was so much altered thereby that it ended in rivalling
painting rather than retaining its own particular features as all arts
should do It may be fairly considered that originally it was used
simply to enrich by vitrified colour articles of use and ornament
Metal was incised and the ornamental spaces thus obtained filled with
one tint of enamel colour each compartment having its own By this
means very brilliant effects were often produced all the more striking
from the pure strength of their simplicity It was not till the twelfth
century that an attempt at floating colours together was made and this
led ultimately to a pictorial treatment of enamel which destroyed its
truest character The very old form was however practised in the
latest days of its use and our engraving of the very beautiful
knifehandle designed by Virgil Solis at the end of the sixteenth
century Figs 4 and 5 was intended to be filled with a dark blue
enamel in the parts here represented in black while the interstices of
the crossshaped ornaments above would receive some lighter tint of
warmer hue The birds and foliage would be carefully engraved the lines
of shadow filled with a permanent black thus assuring a general
brilliancy of effect Such knives were by no means an uncommon
decoration of the table at the period when this was designed it is now
a branch of art utilised until all trace of design has gone from it for
we cannot accept the slight scroll work and contour of a modern silver
knifehandle as a piece of artworkmanship when we remember the
beautiful objects of the kind produced in the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries gorgeous in design and colour and occasionally enriched by
jewels or amber

Illustration Fig 7
There is one class of ancient manufacturing art which has been revived
for the use of the modern world with considerable success We allude to
the Roman works in mosaic which have furnished designs for our
encaustic tilemanufacturers and our floorcloth painters Quaint and
peculiar in its necessary features it is singularly well adapted for
artisans in both materials There is also a great variety in the
ornamental details of ancient pavements at home and abroad the
geometric forms being at times very peculiar as in the specimen we give
in the previous page Fig 6 which has been selected from one
discovered at Aldborough in Yorkshire the Isurium Brigantum of the
Romans a lonely spot containing many traces of its ancient
importance and which has furnished an abundance of relics for the
notice of the antiquary from the days of Camden who describes it with
that happy brevity that accompanies full knowledge The pavement we
engrave may be seen in full coloured detail in Mr Ecroyd Smithas volume
on Isurium the borders placed on each side are portions of other
pavements from the same place selected as showing the commonest and the
most unusual patterns The variety and beauty of design and colour in
encaustic tiles adopted by mediAvalists may be slightly illustrated by
the quaint specimen of foliation copied in Fig 7 The conjunction of
four such tiles produces great variety in pattern and excellent
contrasts of colour
Illustration Figs 8 and 9
Geometric form in all its endless variety was particularly studied in
the Middle Ages and decorative enrichments of all kind subjected to its
ruling control We add two specimens of glasspainting Figs 8 and 9
which are in reality the same design slightly varied in the disposition
of the tints and the interlacing of the double or straplines of one
while the other has them single only The striking variety that any
given design may elicit by a mere rearrangement of this interlaced
work or by a different disposition of the coloured compartments will
at once be apparent it was worked out with singularly good effect by
the older artists in decoration of all kinds The key Fig 10 and the
latch Fig 11 are examples of quaint old Gothic metal works The
latter is copied from the old HA tel de Ville of Bruges the dragon is
used as a lever to lift the latch and is one of those grotesque
imaginings in which the old artworkmen frequently indulged
Illustration Fig 10
Illustration Fig 11
When the Dukes of Urbino dazzled with the brilliancy of the Moorish
potters had determined to rival their workmanship in manufactories
upon their own principality the socalled Raffaelleware soon
afterwards fascinated the Italians by the quaint design and beautiful
colour of the dishes and vases there produced Though popularly named
after the great painter it was unlikely that he had aught to do
therewith but his designs were occasionally adapted to its use by the
workmen The circular plateau Fig 12 is a good example of the bold
character and vigour of effect occasionally produced in these works
Illustration Fig 12
Wood panelling we have already alluded to and the large amount of
decoration it occasionally displayed Fig 13 is a beautiful instance of
the grace that characterised the style known as the Flamboyant from
the flowing or flamelike curve adopted for the leading lines In this
instance they are happily blended with the earlier Gothic cusps and
the quaint ivyleaves that spring easily out of the severer lines The
ease with which heraldry may be introduced in the design gave it a
peculiar charm to our ancestors in this instance the shields bear the
sacred monogramsa purpose to which they were very commonly devoted in
the church sometimes being further enriched with religious emblems as
terse and striking as the heraldic ones we have given in a previous
page

We give two small drawings of cabinethandles in Figs 14 and 15 part
of the elaborate fittings of a piece of furniture which occupied the
place of honour in the staterooms of the wealthy and upon which the
art of the day was generally lavished with a most liberal hand Ivory
ebony and the rarest woods were employed in their construction
occasionally plaques of lapis lazuli or coloured marbles were used
for the panels ultimately the whole surface became an encrusted mosaic
of figures birds and flowers in coloured wood and stone occasionally
framed in the precious metals The gorgeous taste of Louis Quatorze
excited the fancy of the Abenistes of his court to the most costly
invention Furniture inlaid with engraved metalwork or embossed with
coloured stones oppressed the sense of utility and when tables
chairs and pictureframes were made of silver chased and overloaded
with the scrollwork he so abundantly patronised common sense seems to
have yielded its place to mere display Despite of the costly character
of such works and their destination as the decoration of a palace they
are positive vulgarisms and we feel little regret when we read in
history of the disastrous wars at the close of the kingas career which
obliged him to melt down the silver furniture of Versailles and convert
it into cash for the payment of his soldiers
There was more honesty of purpose in the old artworkers who never
swerved from a leading principle Hence the educated eye can at once
detect a piece of genuine old decorative furniture from a Wardour Street
madeup bit of pseudoimitation It must be borne in mind that
specimens of genuine old work are by no means common the abundance
which this street and other localities can supply to order by the
cartload are ingenious adaptations of fragments of old work pieced and
placed together for a general effect but which are sometimes ludicrous
from the mixture of bits of all ages and style in one cabinet or
sideboard Some twenty years ago the city of Rouen was a mine of wealth
to furniture makers The elaborately carved panels and chimneypieces in
the stately houses of the old Norman capital were converted into all
kinds of articles for domestic display The progress of aimprovementa
as well as the slower process of decay have cleared that place of many
of its fine features of domestic architecture but its beauties have had
an enduring memento in the curious volumes by the artist Langlois of
PontdelaArche completed after his death by M DelaquArriA re In this
work every ancient building is carefully noted and described throughout
every street of the city and the finest or most curious examples
engraved with a minute truthfulness for which Langlois was justly
celebrated and which drew forth the plaudits of Dr Dibdin in the
sumptuous work devoted to his foreign tour in search of rarities15
We propose presently to follow the Doctor in his investigation of old
books and exhibit some few of the enrichments that artist and engraver
gave to the written or printed volumes which passed from their hands
at the same time we shall endeavour to take a more general survey of the
adaptation of art to works of ordinary use
Illustration Fig 16
The quaint manner in which letters were sometimes braced together may be
seen in Fig 16 Occasionally a name thus formed in monogram would
require much ingenuity to unravel inasmuch as the entire letters made
but one interlaced and closely compacted group each limb or portion of
a letter helping also to form part of another In the hospital founded
at Edinburgh by the famous goldsmith George Heriotthe favourite
goldsmith and jeweller of James I a monarch who fully appreciated his
artthe name of aJingling Geordiea as his majesty playfully called
him is sculptured in such a group which appears at first sight an
enigma few could unravel indeed without knowing what letters to look
for and how to arrange them it is a chance if they would be arranged
correctly Such a mode of marking would however have its advantages
for it would enable those who were in the secret to unravel the mystery
of the true proprietorship of any valuable article unfairly abstracted
The shields in Fig 13 are filled with monograms less elaborate but
bearing a sufficient affinity to those alluded to to aid in
understanding the rest

CHAPTER II
We owe the term illumination as applied to the decoration of old
manuscripts to the mediAval Latin name of the artist himself
alluminor the root of our English word limner and of the French
word enlumineur one who colours or paints upon paper or parchment
giving light and ornament to letters and figures The brilliancy and
beauty of much of this ancient art are marvellous to look upon but the
names of few of the patient artists who devoted their lives to book
illustration have descended to us There are however one or two names
wellknown to us a Julio Clovio and a Girolamo da Libri Jerome
Veronese affording a sufficient warrant of the highclass minds who
honoured their art by honouring literature There can be no greater
pleasure than in turning over the matchless pages of these old volumes
and seeing them reveal the passages of the poet or romancist as
understood by the men of the Middle Ages to whom they were addressed
or giving us pictures of life and manners of which we possess no other
record Their value as adjuncts to books when simply decorative is now
very generally acknowledged and the ladies of the present day rival the
cloistered recluses in labouring like them to enrich a cherished
volume It is however the art of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries that is now especially imitated and the reason is to be found
in its showy elaboration of design and colour There is an earlier
style that presents strong claims to attention that of the two
preceding centuries specimens of which are given in Figs 1721 In
them will be noticed the Orientalism that occasionally prevails and
shows its Byzantine parentage a trace of the Greek volute and acanthus
leaf is visible in Figs 20 and 21 in the others we seem to look on
Turkish design The applicability of such fragments of ornament is
manifold

When the art of engraving aided the press in producing works of a
decorative order we occasionally turn over pages in which the
masterminds of the day taxed their powers of invention The old
woodengravers were supplied by designers with drawings of the best
class and very quaint and original are the ornaments which embellish
the books of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuriesparticularly such
as were published in Germany or at Lyons the latter city being then
most eminent for the taste and beauty of its illustrated volumes the
former for a bolder but quainter character of art There are useful
hints to be had in the pages of all for such as would avail themselves
of minor bookornament To render our meaning more clear we select a
series of scrolls Figs 2225 for inscriptions from German books of
the early part of the sixteenth century and which might be readily and
usefully adapted to modern exigencies when dates or mottoes are
required either by the painter or sculptor Ornamental frameworks for
inscriptions abound in old books and are not unfrequently of striking
design and peculiar elaboration we give an example in Fig 26 from a
volume dated 1593 as an excellent specimen of this particular branch of
design Such tablets not unfrequently headed the first page of a
volume and received in the centre the title of the book The
woodengraver is thus the legitimate successor of the older illuminator
Illustration Fig 26
A large demand was made on the imaginative faculties of the designers of
that day by the metalworkers the gold and silversmiths the jewellers
and all connected with such decorative manufactures as the luxury of
wealth and taste calls into exertion The name of Cellini stands
prominently forth as the inventor and fabricator of much that was
remarkable the pages of his singular autobiography detail the peculiar
beauty of many of his designs the Viennese collection still boasts some
of the finest of the works so described particularly the golden
saltcellar he made for Francis I of France The high art which he
brought to bear on design applied to jewellery was followed by other
artistworkmen such as Stephanus of Paris and Jamnitzer of Nuremberg
The metalworkers of the latter city and of Augsburg had a universal
reputation at the close of the sixteenth century for their jewellery and
plate particularly the latter They kept in employ the best designers
of the day and such men as Hans Holbein Albert AldegrAf Virgilius
Solis and a host known as the alittle mastersa supplied the demand
with apparent abundance but it could only be satisfied by the
multiplication of these designs by means of the engraveras art Hence we
have at this period and the early part of the seventeenth century an
abundance of small engravings comprising a vast variety of designs for
all articles of ornament and from them we have selected in Figs 27
and 28 two specimens of those intended to be used in the manufacture of
the pendent jewels then so commonly worn on the breast of rich ladies
These jewels were sometimes elaborately modelled with scriptural and
other scenes in their centre chased in gold enriched by enamel
colours and resplendent with jewels The famed aGrA14ne GewAlbea at
Dresden have many fine examples in the Louvre are others and some few
of a good kind are to be seen in the Museum at South Kensington The
portraits of the age of Francis I and our Queen Elizabeth frequently
represent ladies in a superfluity of jewellery of a most elaborate
character The portrait of Mary Queen of Scots in our National
Portrait Gallery is loaded with chains brooches and pendants enough
to stock the showcase of a modern manufacturer This love of elaborate
jewellery was a positive mania with many nobles in the olden time
James I was childishly fond of such trinkets and most portraits
represent the king with hatbands of jewels or sprays of jewellery at
their sides His letters to his favourite Buckingham are often full of
details of the jewels in which his majesty delighted
Illustration Fig 27
Illustration Fig 28
Illustration Fig 29
Perhaps no article of personal ornament has exhibited a greater variety
of design and decorative enrichment than the cross It has at once been
made an embellishment and a badge of faith We select in Fig 29 one of
singular elaboration and beauty now the property of Lady Londesborough
It is a work of the early part of the sixteenth century the ground is
of frosted gold upon which is a foliated ornament in cloissonnA
enamel of various colours It is also enriched with pearl and crystal
the lower part of this cross is furnished with a loop from which a
jewel of value might be suspended
Illustration Figs 30 and 31
By way of curious contrast as well as to show the style of various ages
in the article of necklaces we give in Figs 30 and 31 two examples
of widely different eras The upper one is that of a Roman lady whose
entire collection of jewellery was accidentally discovered at Lyons in
1841 by some workmen who were excavating the southern side of the
heights of FourviA res on the opposite side of the Seine From an
inscribed ring and some coins deposited in the jewelbox the lady
appears to have lived in the time of the Emperor Severus and to have
been the wife of one of the wealthy traders who then as now were
enriched by the traffic of the Rhone The necklace we engrave is of
gold set with pearls and emeralds the cubical beads are cut in lapis
lazuli as are the pendants which hang from others This love of pendent
ornament was common to all antique necklaces from the days of ancient
Greece to the end of the sixteenth century Our second specimen is an
illustration of this it is copied from the portrait of a lady bearing
date 1593 and composed of a series of enamelled plaques with jewels
inserted connected with each other by an ornamental chain
Illustration Figs 32 and 33
We have already alluded to the constant demand on the inventive faculty
of the artworkman for articles of all kinds in the olden times nothing
was thought unworthy his attention We give a selection of articles of
ordinary use which have received a considerable amount of decorative
enrichment The spurrowels Figs 32 and 33 from the collection of M
Sauvageot of Paris are remarkable proofs of the faculty of invention
possessed by the ancient armourers So simple a thing as a spurrowel
in our days of utilitarianism would seem to be incapable of variety
or at least unworthy to receive much attention It was not so in past
times when workmen even delighted to adorn their own tools We engrave
an armoureras hammer Figs 34 and 35 from the collection of Lord
Londesborough which has received an amount of enrichment of a very
varied character The animals on one side and in foliated scrolls
connect the design across the summit of the implement with a totally new
composition on the opposite side We would not insist on any part of the
design as remarkable for high character it is simply given as an
instance of the love of decoration so prevalent in the sixteenth
century
Illustration Figs 34 and 35
The highlyenriched knocker and doorhandle Fig 36 were sketched from
the original on one of the ancient houses of the quaint city of
Nuremberg The bellpull beside it Fig 37 is also from the same
locality There is probably no town in Germany where more artistic old
ironwork is to be seen than in this placeonce the richest of trading
communities when Albert Durer flourished within its walls and the
Emperor Maximilian held royal state in its old castle To all who would
realise the chivalric days of the old German Empire we would say aGo
to Nuremberga
Illustration Figs 36 and 37
The bellows of carved chestnutwood Fig 39 is in the possession of
the Count de Courval It is of simpler and aseverera design than
common inasmuch as it was usual to enrich these useful domestic
implements with an abundance of elaborate designs and fill their
centres with scenes from sacred and profane history
Illustration Fig 38
When ladies delighted in laceworking and in starching and preparing
their produce most carefully they showed their good housewifery in
washing and ironing it with their own hands It was gallantry on the
part of their spouses to make befitting presents of all things requisite
for their labours and worthy their use The boxiron we engrave in Fig
39 is one which has thus been given it bears the monogram of the fair
lady who originally owned it engraved within a atrue loveras knota The
cupidons of the handle ending in flowers may be an emblem of Love and
Hymen forming an appropriate embellishment
Illustration Fig 39
CHAPTER III
Applicability is the most useful characteristic of the style popularly
known as the Renaissance it is confined to no one branch of art but is
capable of extension to all from the most delicate work of the jeweller
to the boldest scrollornament adopted by the sculptor in wood or stone
The Loggie of the Vatican is the best original example of the style as
perfected by Raffaelle and his scholars and applied to wallpainting
It was a free rendering of the antique fresco ornament then just
discovered in the Baths of Petus where extensive excavations were
undertaken in 1506 under the superintendence of the Papal authorities
The classic forms were aseverera than those in use by the artists who
resuscitated the style and were somewhat overlaid with ornament The
details of Raffaelleas own work will not always bear adverse criticism
inasmuch as there are heterogeneous features introduced occasionally
which are not visible in the purer style of antiquity As the fashion
for this decoration travelled northward it increased in freedom from
classic rule and more completely deserved the term agrotesquea which
it occasionally received a term derived from grotte an underground
room of the ancient baths and which we now use chiefly in the sense of
a ludicrous composition Such compositions were not unfrequent on the
walls of Greek and Roman buildings and the German and Flemish artists
with a nationally characteristic love of whimsical design occasionally
ran riot in invention having no rule beyond individual caprice This
unfortunate position offering too great a licence to mere whimsicality
was felt in ancient as well as in modern times Pliny objected on the
grounds of false or incongruous taste to the arabesques of Pompeii
though they approached nearer to the Greek model and Vitruvius with
that purity of taste which was his grand characteristic endorsed the
opinion and enforced it in his teaching We are often in error when we
blindly admire or unhesitatingly adopt the works of the ancients as
perfection In Athens and Rome in past time as in Paris and London at
present we may meet with instances of bad taste for vulgarity belongs
to no age or station and may be visible in the costly decoration of a
rich mansion whose owner is uneducated in art and insists on having
only what he comprehends
The decadence of the betterclass Renaissance design was a natural
consequence of the licence its features might assume and in the
progress of the sixteenth century it became thoroughly vitiated The
troubles which distracted Europe in the later part of that century and
which led to the devastating wars and revolutions of the earlier part of
the following one completed the debasement of artworkmanship Louis
XIV had the glory such as it was of its resuscitation but his taste
was merely that of an overwealthy display which not unfrequently
lapses into positive vulgarisms The style known distinctively by the
name of this monarchwith all its heterogeneous elements its scrolls
of the most obtrusive form fixed to ornament having no proper cohesion
and overlaid with festoons of flowers and fruitis more remarkable for
the oppressive ostentation which was the characteristic of the monarch
