through the Cevennes  A traveller of my sort was a thing hitherto
unheard of in that district  I was looked upon with contempt like a man
who should project a journey to the moon but yet with a respectful
interest like one setting forth for the inclement Pole  All were ready
to help in my preparations a crowd of sympathisers supported me at the
critical moment of a bargain not a step was taken but was heralded by
glasses round and celebrated by a dinner or a breakfast
It was already hard upon October before I was ready to set forth and at
the high altitudes over which my road lay there was no Indian summer to
be looked for  I was determined if not to camp out at least to have
the means of camping out in my possession for there is nothing more
harassing to an easy mind than the necessity of reaching shelter by dusk
and the hospitality of a village inn is not always to be reckoned sure by
those who trudge on foot  A tent above all for a solitary traveller is
troublesome to pitch and troublesome to strike again and even on the
march it forms a conspicuous feature in your baggage  A sleepingsack
on the other hand is always readyyou have only to get into it it
serves a double purposea bed by night a portmanteau by day and it
does not advertise your intention of camping out to every curious passer
by  This is a huge point  If a camp is not secret it is but a troubled
restingplace you become a public character the convivial rustic visits
your bedside after an early supper and you must sleep with one eye open
and be up before the day  I decided on a sleepingsack and after
repeated visits to Le Puy and a deal of high living for myself and my
advisers a sleepingsack was designed constructed and triumphantly
brought home
This child of my invention was nearly six feet square exclusive of two
triangular flaps to serve as a pillow by night and as the top and bottom
of the sack by day  I call it the sack but it was never a sack by
more than courtesy only a sort of long roll or sausage green waterproof
cartcloth without and blue sheeps fur within  It was commodious as a
valise warm and dry for a bed  There was luxurious turning room for
one and at a pinch the thing might serve for two  I could bury myself
in it up to the neck for my head I trusted to a fur cap with a hood to
fold down over my ears and a band to pass under my nose like a
respirator and in case of heavy rain I proposed to make myself a little
tent or tentlet with my waterproof coat three stones and a bent
branch
It will readily be conceived that I could not carry this huge package on
my own merely human shoulders  It remained to choose a beast of
burden  Now a horse is a fine lady among animals flighty timid
delicate in eating of tender health he is too valuable and too restive
to be left alone so that you are chained to your brute as to a fellow
galleyslave a dangerous road puts him out of his wits in short hes
an uncertain and exacting ally and adds thirtyfold to the troubles of
the voyager  What I required was something cheap and small and hardy
and of a stolid and peaceful temper and all these requisites pointed to
a donkey
There dwelt an old man in Monastier of rather unsound intellect
according to some much followed by streetboys and known to fame as
Father Adam  Father Adam had a cart and to draw the cart a diminutive
sheass not much bigger than a dog the colour of a mouse with a kindly
eye and a determined underjaw  There was something neat and highbred
a quakerish elegance about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot  Our
first interview was in Monastier marketplace  To prove her good temper
one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after
another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence
began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued
from a dearth of subjects  I was already backed by a deputation of my
friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came
round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and I and Father Adam
were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour  At length she passed
into my service for the consideration of sixtyfive francs and a glass of
brandy  The sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer
so that Modestine as I instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the
cheaper article  Indeed that was as it should be for she was only an
appurtenance of my mattress or selfacting bedstead on four castors
I had a last interview with Father Adam in a billiardroom at the
witching hour of dawn when I administered the brandy  He professed
himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often
bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black
bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have
been a flight of fancy  He had a name in the village for brutally
misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear
made a clean mark down one cheek
By the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for
me with rings to fasten on my bundle and I thoughtfully completed my kit
and arranged my toilette  By way of armoury and utensils I took a
revolver a little spiritlamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny
candles a jackknife and a large leather flask  The main cargo
consisted of two entire changes of warm clothingbesides my travelling
wear of country velveteen pilotcoat and knitted spencersome books
and my railwayrug which being also in the form of a bag made me a
double castle for cold nights  The permanent larder was represented by
cakes of chocolate and tins of Bologna sausage  All this except what I
carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by
good fortune I threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of
carriage than from any thought that I should want it on my journey  For
more immediate needs I took a leg of cold mutton a bottle of Beaujolais
an empty bottle to carry milk an eggbeater and a considerable quantity
of black bread and white like Father Adam for myself and donkey only
in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed
Monastrians of all shades of thought in politics had agreed in
threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures and with sudden death
in many surprising forms  Cold wolves robbers above all the nocturnal
practical joker were daily and eloquently forced on my attention  Yet
in these vaticinations the true patent danger was left out  Like
Christian it was from my pack I suffered by the way  Before telling my
own mishaps let me in two words relate the lesson of my experience  If
the pack is well strapped at the ends and hung at full lengthnot
doubled for your lifeacross the packsaddle the traveller is safe
The saddle will certainly not fit such is the imperfection of our
transitory life it will assuredly topple and tend to overset but there
are stones on every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting
any tendency to overbalance with a welladjusted stone
On the day of my departure I was up a little after five by six we began
to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust  The
pad would not stay on Modestines back for half a moment  I returned it
to its maker with whom I had so contumelious a passage that the street
outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and
listening  The pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be
more descriptive to say that we threw it at each others heads and at
any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of
freedom
I had a common donkey packsaddlea barde as they call itfitted upon
Modestine and once more loaded her with my effects  The doubled sack
my pilotcoat for it was warm and I was to walk in my waistcoat a
great bar of black bread and an open basket containing the white bread
the mutton and the bottles were all corded together in a very elaborate
system of knots and I looked on the result with fatuous content  In
such a monstrous deckcargo all poised above the donkeys shoulders
with nothing below to balance on a brandnew packsaddle that had not
yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brandnew girths that
might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless
traveller should have seen disaster brewing  That elaborate system of
knots again was the work of too many sympathisers to be very artfully
designed  It is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as
three at a time would have a foot against Modestines quarters and be
hauling with clenched teeth but I learned afterwards that one thoughtful
person without any exercise of force can make a more solid job than
halfadozen heated and enthusiastic grooms  I was then but a novice
even after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security
and I went forth from the stable door as an ox goeth to the slaughter
THE GREEN DONKEYDRIVER
The bell of Monastier was just striking nine as I got quit of these
preliminary troubles and descended the hill through the common  As long
as I was within sight of the windows a secret shame and the fear of some
laughable defeat withheld me from tampering with Modestine  She tripped
along upon her four small hoofs with a sober daintiness of gait from
time to time she shook her ears or her tail and she looked so small
under the bundle that my mind misgave me  We got across the ford without
difficultythere was no doubt about the matter she was docility
itselfand once on the other bank where the road begins to mount
through pinewoods I took in my right hand the unhallowed staff and
with a quaking spirit applied it to the donkey  Modestine brisked up her
pace for perhaps three steps and then relapsed into her former minuet
Another application had the same effect and so with the third  I am
worthy the name of an Englishman and it goes against my conscience to
lay my hand rudely on a female  I desisted and looked her all over from
head to foot the poor brutes knees were trembling and her breathing was
distressed it was plain that she could go no faster on a hill  God
forbid thought I that I should brutalise this innocent creature let
her go at her own pace and let me patiently follow
What that pace was there is no word mean enough to describe it was
something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run it
kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time in five
minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of
the leg  And yet I had to keep close at hand and measure my advance
exactly upon hers for if I dropped a few yards into the rear or went on
a few yards ahead Modestine came instantly to a halt and began to
browse  The thought that this was to last from here to Alais nearly
broke my heart  Of all conceivable journeys this promised to be the
most tedious  I tried to tell myself it was a lovely day I tried to
charm my foreboding spirit with tobacco but I had a vision ever present
to me of the long long roads up hill and down dale and a pair of
figures ever infinitesimally moving foot by foot a yard to the minute
and like things enchanted in a nightmare approaching no nearer to the
goal
In the meantime there came up behind us a tall peasant perhaps forty
years of age of an ironical snuffy countenance and arrayed in the green
tailcoat of the country  He overtook us hand over hand and stopped to
consider our pitiful advance
Your donkey says he is very old
I told him I believed not
Then he supposed we had come far
I told him we had but newly left Monastier
Et vous marchez comme ca cried he and throwing back his head he
laughed long and heartily  I watched him half prepared to feel
offended until he had satisfied his mirth and then You must have no
pity on these animals said he and plucking a switch out of a thicket
he began to lace Modestine about the sternworks uttering a cry  The
rogue pricked up her ears and broke into a good round pace which she
kept up without flagging and without exhibiting the least symptom of
distress as long as the peasant kept beside us  Her former panting and
shaking had been I regret to say a piece of comedy
My deus ex machina before he left me supplied some excellent if
inhumane advice presented me with the switch which he declared she
would feel more tenderly than my cane and finally taught me the true cry
or masonic word of donkeydrivers Proot  All the time he regarded me
with a comical incredulous air which was embarrassing to confront and
smiled over my donkeydriving as I might have smiled over his
orthography or his green tailcoat  But it was not my turn for the
moment
I was proud of my new lore and thought I had learned the art to
perfection  And certainly Modestine did wonders for the rest of the fore
noon and I had a breathing space to look about me  It was Sabbath the
mountainfields were all vacant in the sunshine and as we came down
through St Martin de Frugeres the church was crowded to the door there
were people kneeling without upon the steps and the sound of the
priests chanting came forth out of the dim interior  It gave me a home
feeling on the spot for I am a countryman of the Sabbath so to speak
and all Sabbath observances like a Scottish accent strike in me mixed
feelings grateful and the reverse  It is only a traveller hurrying by
like a person from another planet who can rightly enjoy the peace and
beauty of the great ascetic feast  The sight of the resting country does
his spirit good  There is something better than music in the wide
unusual silence and it disposes him to amiable thoughts like the sound
of a little river or the warmth of sunlight
In this pleasant humour I came down the hill to where Goudet stands in a
green end of a valley with Chateau Beaufort opposite upon a rocky steep
and the stream as clear as crystal lying in a deep pool between them
Above and below you may hear it wimpling over the stones an amiable
stripling of a river which it seems absurd to call the Loire  On all
sides Goudet is shut in by mountains rocky footpaths practicable at
best for donkeys join it to the outer world of France and the men and
women drink and swear in their green corner or look up at the snowclad
peaks in winter from the threshold of their homes in an isolation you
would think like that of Homers Cyclops  But it is not so the postman
reaches Goudet with the letterbag the aspiring youth of Goudet are
within a days walk of the railway at Le Puy and here in the inn you may
find an engraved portrait of the hosts nephew Regis Senac Professor
of Fencing and Champion of the two Americas a distinction gained by
him along with the sum of five hundred dollars at Tammany Hall New
York on the 10th April 1876
I hurried over my midday meal and was early forth again  But alas as
we climbed the interminable hill upon the other side Proot seemed to
have lost its virtue  I prooted like a lion I prooted mellifluously
like a suckingdove but Modestine would be neither softened nor
intimidated  She held doggedly to her pace nothing but a blow would
move her and that only for a second  I must follow at her heels
incessantly belabouring  A moments pause in this ignoble toil and she
relapsed into her own private gait  I think I never heard of any one in
as mean a situation  I must reach the lake of Bouchet where I meant to
camp before sundown and to have even a hope of this I must instantly
maltreat this uncomplaining animal  The sound of my own blows sickened
me  Once when I looked at her she had a faint resemblance to a lady of
my acquaintance who formerly loaded me with kindness and this increased
my horror of my cruelty
To make matters worse we encountered another donkey ranging at will
upon the roadside and this other donkey chanced to be a gentleman  He
and Modestine met nickering for joy and I had to separate the pair and
beat down their young romance with a renewed and feverish bastinado  If
the other donkey had had the heart of a male under his hide he would
have fallen upon me tooth and hoof and this was a kind of consolationhe
was plainly unworthy of Modestines affection  But the incident saddened
me as did everything that spoke of my donkeys sex
It was blazing hot up the valley windless with vehement sun upon my
shoulders and I had to labour so consistently with my stick that the
sweat ran into my eyes  Every five minutes too the pack the basket
and the pilotcoat would take an ugly slew to one side or the other and
I had to stop Modestine just when I had got her to a tolerable pace of
about two miles an hour to tug push shoulder and readjust the load
And at last in the village of Ussel saddle and all the whole hypothec
turned round and grovelled in the dust below the donkeys belly  She
none better pleased incontinently drew up and seemed to smile and a
party of one man two women and two children came up and standing
round me in a halfcircle encouraged her by their example
I had the devils own trouble to get the thing righted and the instant I
had done so without hesitation it toppled and fell down upon the other
side  Judge if I was hot  And yet not a hand was offered to assist me
The man indeed told me I ought to have a package of a different shape
I suggested if he knew nothing better to the point in my predicament he
might hold his tongue  And the goodnatured dog agreed with me
smilingly  It was the most despicable fix  I must plainly content
myself with the pack for Modestine and take the following items for my
own share of the portage a cane a quartflask a pilotjacket heavily
weighted in the pockets two pounds of black bread and an open basket
full of meats and bottles  I believe I may say I am not devoid of
greatness of soul for I did not recoil from this infamous burden  I
disposed it Heaven knows how so as to be mildly portable and then
proceeded to steer Modestine through the village  She tried as was
indeed her invariable habit to enter every house and every courtyard in
the whole length and encumbered as I was without a hand to help
myself no words can render an idea of my difficulties  A priest with
six or seven others was examining a church in process of repair and he
and his acolytes laughed loudly as they saw my plight
I remembered having laughed myself when I had seen good men struggling
with adversity in the person of a jackass and the recollection filled me
with penitence  That was in my old light days before this trouble came
upon me  God knows at least that I shall never laugh again thought I
But oh what a cruel thing is a farce to those engaged in it
A little out of the village Modestine filled with the demon set her
heart upon a byroad and positively refused to leave it  I dropped all
my bundles and I am ashamed to say struck the poor sinner twice across
the face  It was pitiful to see her lift her head with shut eyes as if
waiting for another blow  I came very near crying but I did a wiser
thing than that and sat squarely down by the roadside to consider my
situation under the cheerful influence of tobacco and a nip of brandy
Modestine in the meanwhile munched some black bread with a contrite
hypocritical air  It was plain that I must make a sacrifice to the gods
of shipwreck  I threw away the empty bottle destined to carry milk I
threw away my own white bread and disdaining to act by general average
kept the black bread for Modestine lastly I threw away the cold leg of
mutton and the eggwhisk although this last was dear to my heart  Thus
I found room for everything in the basket and even stowed the boating
coat on the top  By means of an end of cord I slung it under one arm
and although the cord cut my shoulder and the jacket hung almost to the
ground it was with a heart greatly lightened that I set forth again
I had now an arm free to thrash Modestine and cruelly I chastised her
If I were to reach the lakeside before dark she must bestir her little
shanks to some tune  Already the sun had gone down into a windylooking
mist and although there were still a few streaks of gold far off to the
east on the hills and the black firwoods all was cold and grey about
our onward path  An infinity of little country byroads led hither and
thither among the fields  It was the most pointless labyrinth  I could
see my destination overhead or rather the peak that dominates it but
choose as I pleased the roads always ended by turning away from it and
sneaking back towards the valley or northward along the margin of the
hills  The failing light the waning colour the naked unhomely stony
country through which I was travelling threw me into some despondency  I
promise you the stick was not idle I think every decent step that
Modestine took must have cost me at least two emphatic blows  There was
not another sound in the neighbourhood but that of my unwearying
bastinado
Suddenly in the midst of my toils the load once more bit the dust and
as by enchantment all the cords were simultaneously loosened and the
road scattered with my dear possessions  The packing was to begin again
from the beginning and as I had to invent a new and better system I do
not doubt but I lost half an hour  It began to be dusk in earnest as I
reached a wilderness of turf and stones  It had the air of being a road
which should lead everywhere at the same time and I was falling into
something not unlike despair when I saw two figures stalking towards me
over the stones  They walked one behind the other like tramps but their
pace was remarkable  The son led the way a tall illmade sombre
Scottishlooking man the mother followed all in her Sundays best with
an elegantly embroidered ribbon to her cap and a new felt hat atop and
proffering as she strode along with kilted petticoats a string of
obscene and blasphemous oaths
I hailed the son and asked him my direction  He pointed loosely west
and northwest muttered an inaudible comment and without slackening
his pace for an instant stalked on as he was going right athwart my
path  The mother followed without so much as raising her head  I
shouted and shouted after them but they continued to scale the hillside
and turned a deaf ear to my outcries  At last leaving Modestine by
herself I was constrained to run after them hailing the while  They
stopped as I drew near the mother still cursing and I could see she was
a handsome motherly respectablelooking woman  The son once more
answered me roughly and inaudibly and was for setting out again  But
this time I simply collared the mother who was nearest me and
apologising for my violence declared that I could not let them go until
they had put me on my road  They were neither of them offendedrather
mollified than otherwise told me I had only to follow them and then the
mother asked me what I wanted by the lake at such an hour  I replied in
the Scottish manner by inquiring if she had far to go herself  She told
me with another oath that she had an hour and a halfs road before her
And then without salutation the pair strode forward again up the
hillside in the gathering dusk
I returned for Modestine pushed her briskly forward and after a sharp
ascent of twenty minutes reached the edge of a plateau  The view
looking back on my days journey was both wild and sad  Mount Mezenc
and the peaks beyond St Julien stood out in trenchant gloom against a
cold glitter in the east and the intervening field of hills had fallen
together into one broad wash of shadow except here and there the outline
of a wooded sugarloaf in black here and there a white irregular patch
to represent a cultivated farm and here and there a blot where the
Loire the Gazeille or the Laussonne wandered in a gorge
Soon we were on a highroad and surprise seized on my mind as I beheld a
village of some magnitude close at hand for I had been told that the
neighbourhood of the lake was uninhabited except by trout  The road
smoked in the twilight with children driving home cattle from the fields
and a pair of mounted stridelegged women hat and cap and all dashed
past me at a hammering trot from the canton where they had been to church
and market  I asked one of the children where I was  At Bouchet St
Nicolas he told me  Thither about a mile south of my destination and
on the other side of a respectable summit had these confused roads and
treacherous peasantry conducted me  My shoulder was cut so that it hurt
sharply my arm ached like toothache from perpetual beating I gave up
the lake and my design to camp and asked for the auberge
I HAVE A GOAD
The auberge of Bouchet St Nicolas was among the least pretentious I have
ever visited but I saw many more of the like upon my journey  Indeed
it was typical of these French highlands  Imagine a cottage of two
stories with a bench before the door the stable and kitchen in a suite
so that Modestine and I could hear each other dining furniture of the
plainest earthern floors a single bedchamber for travellers and that
without any convenience but beds  In the kitchen cooking and eating go
forward side by side and the family sleep at night  Any one who has a
fancy to wash must do so in public at the common table  The food is
sometimes spare hard fish and omelette have been my portion more than
once the wine is of the smallest the brandy abominable to man and the
visit of a fat sow grouting under the table and rubbing against your
legs is no impossible accompaniment to dinner
But the people of the inn in nine cases out of ten show themselves
friendly and considerate  As soon as you cross the doors you cease to be
a stranger and although these peasantry are rude and forbidding on the
highway they show a tincture of kind breeding when you share their
hearth  At Bouchet for instance I uncorked my bottle of Beaujolais
and asked the host to join me  He would take but little
I am an amateur of such wine do you see he said and I am capable of
leaving you not enough
In these hedgeinns the traveller is expected to eat with his own knife
unless he ask no other will be supplied with a glass a whang of bread
and an iron fork the table is completely laid  My knife was cordially
admired by the landlord of Bouchet and the spring filled him with
wonder
I should never have guessed that he said  I would bet he added
weighing it in his hand that this cost you not less than five francs
When I told him it had cost me twenty his jaw dropped
He was a mild handsome sensible friendly old man astonishingly
ignorant  His wife who was not so pleasant in her manners knew how to
read although I do not suppose she ever did so  She had a share of
brains and spoke with a cutting emphasis like one who ruled the roast
My man knows nothing she said with an angry nod he is like the
beasts
And the old gentleman signified acquiescence with his head  There was no
contempt on her part and no shame on his the facts were accepted
loyally and no more about the matter
I was tightly crossexamined about my journey and the lady understood in
a moment and sketched out what I should put into my book when I got
home  Whether people harvest or not in such or such a place if there
were forests studies of manners what for example I and the master of
the house say to you the beauties of Nature and all that  And she
interrogated me with a look
It is just that said I
You see she added to her husband I understood that
They were both much interested by the story of my misadventures
In the morning said the husband I will make you something better
than your cane  Such a beast as that feels nothing it is in the
proverbdur comme un ane you might beat her insensible with a cudgel
and yet you would arrive nowhere
Something better  I little knew what he was offering
The sleepingroom was furnished with two beds  I had one and I will own
I was a little abashed to find a young man and his wife and child in the
act of mounting into the other  This was my first experience of the
sort and if I am always to feel equally silly and extraneous I pray God
it be my last as well  I kept my eyes to myself and know nothing of the
woman except that she had beautiful arms and seemed no whit embarrassed
by my appearance  As a matter of fact the situation was more trying to
me than to the pair  A pair keep each other in countenance it is the
single gentleman who has to blush  But I could not help attributing my
sentiments to the husband and sought to conciliate his tolerance with a
cup of brandy from my flask  He told me that he was a cooper of Alais
travelling to St Etienne in search of work and that in his spare
moments he followed the fatal calling of a maker of matches  Me he
readily enough divined to be a brandy merchant
I was up first in the morning Monday September 23rd and hastened my
toilette guiltily so as to leave a clear field for madam the coopers
wife  I drank a bowl of milk and set off to explore the neighbourhood
of Bouchet  It was perishing cold a grey windy wintry morning misty
clouds flew fast and low the wind piped over the naked platform and the
only speck of colour was away behind Mount Mezenc and the eastern hills
where the sky still wore the orange of the dawn
It was five in the morning and four thousand feet above the sea and I
had to bury my hands in my pockets and trot  People were trooping out to
the labours of the field by twos and threes and all turned round to
stare upon the stranger  I had seen them coming back last night I saw
them going afield again and there was the life of Bouchet in a nutshell
When I came back to the inn for a bit of breakfast the landlady was in
the kitchen combing out her daughters hair and I made her my
compliments upon its beauty
Oh no said the mother it is not so beautiful as it ought to be
Look it is too fine
Thus does a wise peasantry console itself under adverse physical
circumstances and by a startling democratic process the defects of the
majority decide the type of beauty
And where said I is monsieur
The master of the house is upstairs she answered making you a goad
Blessed be the man who invented goads  Blessed the innkeeper of Bouchet
St Nicolas who introduced me to their use  This plain wand with an
eighth of an inch of pin was indeed a sceptre when he put it in my
hands  Thenceforward Modestine was my slave  A prick and she passed
the most inviting stable door  A prick and she broke forth into a
gallant little trotlet that devoured the miles  It was not a remarkable
speed when all was said and we took four hours to cover ten miles at
the best of it  But what a heavenly change since yesterday  No more
wielding of the ugly cudgel no more flailing with an aching arm no more
broadsword exercise but a discreet and gentlemanly fence  And what
although now and then a drop of blood should appear on Modestines mouse
coloured wedgelike rump  I should have preferred it otherwise indeed
but yesterdays exploits had purged my heart of all humanity  The
perverse little devil since she would not be taken with kindness must
even go with pricking
It was bleak and bitter cold and except a cavalcade of stridelegged
ladies and a pair of postrunners the road was dead solitary all the way
to Pradelles  I scarce remember an incident but one  A handsome foal
with a bell about his neck came charging up to us upon a stretch of
common sniffed the air martially as one about to do great deeds and
suddenly thinking otherwise in his green young heart put about and
galloped off as he had come the bell tinkling in the wind  For a long
while afterwards I saw his noble attitude as he drew up and heard the
note of his bell and when I struck the highroad the song of the
telegraphwires seemed to continue the same music
Pradelles stands on a hillside high above the Allier surrounded by rich
meadows  They were cutting aftermath on all sides which gave the
neighbourhood this gusty autumn morning an untimely smell of hay  On
the opposite bank of the Allier the land kept mounting for miles to the
horizon a tanned and sallow autumn landscape with black blots of fir
wood and white roads wandering through the hills  Over all this the
clouds shed a uniform and purplish shadow sad and somewhat menacing
exaggerating height and distance and throwing into still higher relief
the twisted ribbons of the highway  It was a cheerless prospect but one
stimulating to a traveller  For I was now upon the limit of Velay and
all that I beheld lay in another countywild Gevaudan mountainous
uncultivated and but recently disforested from terror of the wolves
Wolves alas like bandits seem to flee the travellers advance and you
may trudge through all our comfortable Europe and not meet with an
adventure worth the name  But here if anywhere a man was on the
frontiers of hope  For this was the land of the evermemorable BEAST
the Napoleon Bonaparte of wolves  What a career was his  He lived ten
months at free quarters in Gevaudan and Vivarais he ate women and
