THE PRELUDE
SCENE A plantation of thin young trees in a misty and rainy
twilight some woodland blossom showing the patches on the earth
between the stems
THE STRANGER is discovered a cloaked figure with a pointed hood
His costume might belong to modern or any other time and the
conical hood is so drawn over the head that little can be seen of
the face
A distant voice a womans is heard halfsinging halfchanting
unintelligible words The cloaked figure raises its head and
listens with interest The song draws nearer and PATRICIA CARLEON
enters She is dark and slight and has a dreamy expression
Though she is artistically dressed her hair is a little wild She
has a broken branch of some flowering tree in her hand She does
not notice the stranger and though he has watched her with
interest makes no sign Suddenly she perceives him and starts
back
PATRICIA Oh Who are you
STRANGER Ah Who am I Commences to mutter to himself and maps out
the ground with his staff
I have a hat but not to wear
I wear a sword but not to slay
And ever in my bag I bear
A pack of cards but not to play
PATRICIA What are you What are you saying
STRANGER It is the language of the fairies O daughter of Eve
PATRICIA But I never thought fairies were like you Why you are taller
than I am
STRANGER We are of such stature as we will But the elves grow small
not large when they would mix with mortals
PATRICIA You mean they are beings greater than we are
STRANGER Daughter of men if you would see a fairy as he truly is look
for his head above all the stars and his feet amid the floors of the
sea Old women have taught you that the fairies are too small to be
seen But I tell you the fairies are too mighty to be seen For they are
the elder gods before whom the giants were like pigmies They are the
Elemental Spirits and any one of them is larger than the world And you
look for them in acorns and on toadstools and wonder that you never see
them
PATRICIA But you come in the shape and size of a man
STRANGER Because I would speak with a woman
PATRICIA Drawing back in awe I think you are growing taller as you
speak
The scene appears to fade away and give place to the milieu of
ACT ONE the Dukes drawingroom an apartment with open French
windows or any opening large enough to show a garden and one house
fairly near It is evening and there is a red lamp lighted in the
house beyond The REV CYRIL SMITH is sitting with hat and
umbrella beside him evidently a visitor He is a young man with
the highest of High Church dogcollars and all the qualities of a
restrained fanatic He is one of the Christian Socialist sort and
takes his priesthood seriously He is an honest man and not an
ass
To him enters MR HASTINGS with papers in his hand
HASTINGS Oh good evening You are Mr Smith Pause I mean you are
the Rector I think
SMITH I am the Rector
HASTINGS I am the Dukes secretary His Grace asks me to say that he
hopes to see you very soon but he is engaged just now with the Doctor
SMITH Is the Duke ill
HASTINGS Laughing Oh no the Doctor has come to ask him to help
some cause or other The Duke is never ill
SMITH Is the Doctor with him now
HASTINGS Why strictly speaking he is not The Doctor has gone over
the road to fetch a paper connected with his proposal But he hasnt far
to go as you can see Thats his red lamp at the end of his grounds
SMITH Yes I know I am much obliged to you I will wait as long as is
necessary
HASTINGS Cheerfully Oh it wont be very long
Exit
Enter by the garden doors DR GRIMTHORPE reading an open paper
He is an oldfashioned practitioner very much of a gentleman and
very carefully dressed in a slightly antiquated style He is about
sixty years old and might have been a friend of Huxleys
DOCTOR Folding up the paper I beg your pardon sir I did not
notice there was anyone here
SMITH Amicably I beg yours A new clergyman cannot expect to be
expected I only came to see the Duke about some local affairs
DOCTOR Smiling And so oddly enough did I But I suppose we
should both like to get hold of him by a separate ear
SMITH Oh theres no disguise as far as Im concerned Ive joined this
league for starting a model publichouse in the parish and in plain
words Ive come to ask his Grace for a subscription to it
DOCTOR Grimly And as it happens I have joined in the petition
against the erection of a model publichouse in this parish The
similarity of our position grows with every instant
SMITH Yes I think we must have been twins
DOCTOR More goodhumouredly Well what is a model publichouse Do
you mean a toy
SMITH I mean a place where Englishmen can get decent drink and drink it
decently Do you call that a toy
DOCTOR No I should call that a conjuring trick Or in apology to your
cloth I will say a miracle
SMITH I accept the apology to my cloth I am doing my duty as a priest
How can the Church have a right to make men fast if she does not allow
them to feast
DOCTOR Bitterly And when you have done feasting them you will
send them to me to be cured
SMITH Yes and when youve done curing them youll send them to me to
be buried
DOCTOR After a pause laughing Well you have all the old
doctrines It is only fair you should have all the old jokes too
SMITH Laughing also By the way you call it a conjuring trick that
poor people should drink moderately
DOCTOR I call it a chemical discovery that alcohol is not a food
SMITH You dont drink wine yourself
DOCTOR Mildly startled Drink wine Wellwhat else is there to
drink
SMITH So drinking decently is a conjuring trick that you can do
anyhow
DOCTOR Still goodhumouredly Well well let us hope so Talking
about conjuring tricks there is to be conjuring and all kinds of things
here this afternoon
SMITH Conjuring Indeed Why is that
Enter HASTINGS with a letter in each hand
HASTINGS His Grace will be with you presently He asked me to deal with
the business matter first of all
He gives a note to each of them
SMITH Turning eagerly to the DOCTOR But this is rather splendid
The Dukes given 50 to the new publichouse
HASTINGS The Duke is very liberal
Collects papers
DOCTOR Examining his cheque Very But this is rather curious He
has also given 50 to the league for opposing the new publichouse
HASTINGS The Duke is very liberalminded
Exit
SMITH Staring at his cheque Liberalminded Absentminded I
should call it
DOCTOR Sitting down and lighting a cigar Well yes The Duke does
suffer a little from absence puts his cigar in his mouth and pulls
during the pause of mind He is all for compromise Dont you know the
kind of man who when you talk to him about the five best breeds of dog
always ends up by buying a mongrel The Duke is the kindest of men and
always trying to please everybody He generally finishes by pleasing
nobody
SMITH Yes I think I know the sort of thing
DOCTOR Take this conjuring for instance You know the Duke has two
wards who are to live with him now
SMITH Yes I heard something about a nephew and niece from Ireland
DOCTOR The niece came from Ireland some months ago but the nephew
comes back from America tonight He gets up abruptly and walks about
the room I think I will tell you all about it In spite of your
precious publichouse you seem to me to be a sane man And I fancy I
shall want all the sane men I can get tonight
SMITH Rising also I am at your service Do you know I rather
guessed you did not come here only to protest against my precious
publichouse
DOCTOR Striding about in subdued excitement Well you guessed
right I was family physician to the Dukes brother in Ireland I knew
the family pretty well
SMITH Quietly I suppose you mean you knew something odd about the
family
DOCTOR Well they saw fairies and things of that sort
SMITH And I suppose to the medical mind seeing fairies means much the
same as seeing snakes
DOCTOR With a sour smile Well they saw them in Ireland I suppose
its quite correct to see fairies in Ireland Its like gambling at
Monte Carlo Its quite respectable But I do draw the line at their
seeing fairies in England I do object to their bringing their ghosts
and goblins and witches into the poor Dukes own back garden and within
a yard of my own red lamp It shows a lack of tact
SMITH But I do understand that the Dukes nephew and niece see witches
and fairies between here and your lamp
He walks to the garden window and looks out
DOCTOR Well the nephew has been in America It stands to reason you
cant see fairies in America But there is this sort of superstition in
the family and I am not easy in my mind about the girl
SMITH Why what does she do
DOCTOR Oh she wanders about the park and the woods in the evenings
Damp evenings for choice She calls it the Celtic twilight Ive no use
for the Celtic twilight myself It has a tendency to get on the chest
But what is worse she is always talking about meeting somebody some
elf or wizard or something I dont like it at all
SMITH Have you told the Duke
DOCTOR With a grim smile Oh yes I told the Duke The result was
the conjurer
SMITH With amazement The conjurer
DOCTOR Puts down his cigar in the ashtray The Duke is
indescribable He will be here presently and you shall judge for
yourself Put two or three facts or ideas before him and the thing he
makes out of them is always something that seems to have nothing to do
with it Tell any other human being about a girl dreaming of the fairies
and her practical brother from America and he would settle it in some
obvious way and satisfy some one send her to America or let her have
her fairies in Ireland Now the Duke thinks a conjurer would just meet
the case I suppose he vaguely thinks it would brighten things up and
somehow satisfy the believers interest in supernatural things and the
unbelievers interest in smart things As a matter of fact the
unbeliever thinks the conjurers a fraud and the believer thinks hes a
fraud too The conjurer satisfies nobody That is why he satisfies the
Duke
Enter the DUKE with HASTINGS carrying papers The DUKE is
a healthy hearty man in tweeds with a rather wandering eye In
the present state of the peerage it is necessary to explain that
the DUKE though an ass is a gentleman
DUKE Goodmorning Mr Smith So sorry to have kept you waiting but
were rather in a rush today Turns to HASTINGS who has gone over
to a table with the papers You know Mr Carleon is coming this
afternoon
HASTINGS Yes your Grace His train will be in by now I have sent the
trap
DUKE Thank you Turning to the other two My nephew Dr
Grimthorpe Morris you know Miss Carleons brother from America I
hear hes been doing great things out there Petrol or something Must
move with the times eh
DOCTOR Im afraid Mr Smith doesnt always agree with moving with the
times
DUKE Oh come come Progress you know progress Of course I know how
busy you are you mustnt overwork yourself you know Hastings was
telling me you laughed over those subscriptions of mine Well well I
believe in looking at both sides of a question you know Aspects as
old Buffle called them Aspects With an allembracing gesture of the
arm You represent the tendency to drink in moderation and you do
good in your way The Doctor represents the tendency not to drink at
all and he does good in his way We cant be Ancient Britons you
know
A prolonged and puzzled silence such as always follows the more
abrupt of the DUKES associations or disassociations of thought
SMITH At last faintly Ancient Britons
DOCTOR To SMITH in a low voice Dont bother Its only his
broadmindedness
DUKE With unabated cheerfulness I saw the place youre putting up
for it Mr Smith Very good work Very good work indeed Art for the
people eh I particularly liked that woodwork over the west doorIm
glad to see youre using the new sort of graining  why it all
reminds one of the French Revolution
Another silence As the DUKE lounges alertly about the room
SMITH speaks to the DOCTOR in an undertone
SMITH Does it remind you of the French Revolution
DOCTOR As much as of anything else His Grace never reminds me of
anything
A young and very high American voice is heard calling in the
garden Say could somebody see to one of these trunks
MR HASTINGS goes out into the garden He returns with MORRIS
CARLEON a very young man hardly more than a boy but with very
grownup American dress and manners He is dark smallish and
active and the racial type under his Americanism is Irish
MORRIS Humorously as he puts in his head at the window See here
does a Duke live here
DOCTOR Who is nearest to him with great gravity Yes only one
MORRIS I reckon hes the one I want anyhow Im his nephew
The DUKE who is ruminating in the foreground with one eye
rather off turns at the voice and shakes MORRIS warmly by the
hand
DUKE Delighted to see you my dear boy I hear youve been doing very
well for yourself
MORRIS Laughing Well pretty well Duke and better still for Paul
T Vandam I guess I manage the old mans mines out in Arizona you
know
DUKE Shaking his head sagaciously Ah very goahead man Very
goahead methods Im told Well I dare say he does a great deal of
good with his money And we cant go back to the Spanish Inquisition
Silence during which the three men look at each other
MORRIS Abruptly And hows Patricia
DUKE A little hazily Oh shes very well I think She
He hesitates slightly
MORRIS Smiling Well then wheres Patricia
There is a slightly embarrassed pause and the DOCTOR speaks
DOCTOR Miss Carleon is walking about the grounds I think
MORRIS goes to the garden doors and looks out
MORRIS Its a mighty chilly night to choose Does my sister commonly
select such evenings to take the airand the damp
DOCTOR After a pause If I may say so I quite agree with you I
have often taken the liberty of warning your sister against going out in
all weathers like this
DUKE Expansively waving his hands about The artist temperament
What I always call the artistic temperament Wordsworth you know and
all that
Silence
MORRIS Staring All what
DUKE Continuing to lecture with enthusiasm Why everythings
temperament you know Its her temperament to see the fairies Its my
temperament not to see the fairies Why Ive walked all round the
grounds twenty times and never saw a fairy Well its like that about
this wizard or whatever she calls it For her there is somebody there
For us there would not be somebody there Dont you see
MORRIS Advancing excitedly Somebody there What do you mean
DUKE Airily Well you cant quite call it a man
MORRIS Violently A man
DUKE Well as old Buffle used to say what is a man
MORRIS With a strong rise of the American accent With your
permission Duke I eliminate old Buffle Do you mean that anybody has
had the tarnation coolness to suggest that some man
DUKE Oh not a man you know A magician something mythical you
know
SMITH Not a man but a medicine man
DOCTOR Grimly I am a medicine man
MORRIS And you dont look mythical Doc
He bites his finger and begins to pace restlessly up and down the
room
DUKE Well you know the artistic temperament
MORRIS Turning suddenly See here Duke In most commercial ways
were a pretty forward country In these moral ways were content to be
a pretty backward country And if you ask me whether I like my sister
walking about the woods on a night like this Well I dont
DUKE I am afraid you Americans arent so advanced as Id hoped Why as
old Buffle used to say
As he speaks a distant voice is heard singing in the garden it
comes nearer and nearer and SMITH turns suddenly to the DOCTOR
SMITH Whose voice is that
DOCTOR It is no business of mine to decide
MORRIS Walking to the window You need not trouble I know who it
is
Enter PATRICIA CARLEON
Still agitated Patricia where have you been
PATRICIA Rather wearily Oh in Fairyland
DOCTOR Genially And whereabouts is that
PATRICIA Its rather different from other places Its either nowhere
or its wherever you are
MORRIS Sharply Has it any inhabitants
PATRICIA Generally only two Oneself and ones shadow But whether he
is my shadow or I am his shadow is never found out
MORRIS He Who
PATRICIA Seeming to understand his annoyance for the first time and
smiling Oh you neednt get conventional about it Morris He is not
a mortal
MORRIS Whats his name
PATRICIA We have no names there You never really know anybody if you
know his name
MORRIS What does he look like
PATRICIA I have only met him in the twilight He seems robed in a long
cloak with a peaked cap or hood like the elves in my nursery stories
Sometimes when I look out of the window here I see him passing round
this house like a shadow and see his pointed hood dark against the
sunset or the rising of the moon
SMITH What does he talk about
PATRICIA He tells me the truth Very many true things He is a wizard
MORRIS How do you know hes a wizard I suppose he plays some tricks on
you
PATRICIA I should know he was a wizard if he played no tricks But once
he stooped and picked up a stone and cast it into the air and it flew
up into Gods heaven like a bird
MORRIS Was that what first made you think he was a wizard
PATRICIA Oh no When I first saw him he was tracing circles and
pentacles in the grass and talking the language of the elves
MORRIS Sceptically Do you know the language of the elves
PATRICIA Not until I heard it
MORRIS Lowering his voice as if for his sister but losing patience
so completely that he talks much louder than he imagines See here
Patricia I reckon this kind of thing is going to be the limit Im just
not going to have you let in by some blamed tramp or fortuneteller
because you choose to read minor poetry about the fairies If this gipsy
or whatever he is troubles you again
DOCTOR Putting his hand on MORRISS shoulder Come you must
allow a little more for poetry We cant all feed on nothing but petrol
DUKE Quite right quite right And being Irish dont you know Celtic
as old Buffle used to say charming songs you know about the Irish
girl who has a plaid shawland a Banshee Sighs profoundly Poor
old Gladstone
Silence as usual
SMITH Speaking to DOCTOR I thought you yourself considered the
family superstition bad for the health
DOCTOR I consider a family superstition is better for the health than a
family quarrel He walks casually across to PATRICIA Well it must
be nice to be young and still see all those stars and sunsets We old
buffers wont be too strict with you if your view of things sometimes
gets a bitmixed up shall we say If the stars get loose about the
grass by mistake or if once or twice the sunset gets into the east
We should only say Dream as much as you like Dream for all mankind
Dream for us who can dream no longer But do not quite forget the
difference
PATRICIA What difference
DOCTOR The difference between the things that are beautiful and the
things that are there That red lamp over my door isnt beautiful but
its there You might even come to be glad it is there when the stars
of gold and silver have faded I am an old man now but some men are
still glad to find my red star I do not say they are the wise men
PATRICIA Somewhat affected Yes I know you are good to everybody
But dont you think there may be floating and spiritual stars which will
last longer than the red lamps
SMITH With decision Yes But they are fixed stars
DOCTOR The red lamp will last my time
DUKE Capital Capital Why its like Tennyson Silence I remember
when I was an undergrad
The red light disappears no one sees it at first except
PATRICIA who points excitedly
MORRIS Whats the matter
PATRICIA The red star is gone
MORRIS Nonsense Rushes to the garden doors Its only somebody
standing in front of it Say Duke theres somebody standing in the
garden
PATRICIA Calmly I told you he walked about the garden
MORRIS If its that fortuneteller of yours
Disappears into the garden followed by the DOCTOR
DUKE Staring Somebody in the garden Really this Land
Campaign
Silence
MORRIS reappears rather breathless
MORRIS A spry fellow your friend He slipped through my hands like a
shadow
PATRICIA I told you he was a shadow
MORRIS Well I guess theres going to be a shadow hunt Got a lantern
Duke
PATRICIA Oh you need not trouble He will come if I call him
She goes out into the garden and calls out some halfchanted and
unintelligible words somewhat like the song preceding her
entrance The red light reappears and there is a slight sound as
of fallen leaves shuffled by approaching feet The cloaked
STRANGER with the pointed hood is seen standing outside the garden
doors
PATRICIA You may enter all doors
The figure comes into the room
MORRIS Shutting the garden doors behind him Now see here wizard
weve got you And we know youre a fraud
SMITH Quietly Pardon me I do not fancy that we know that For
myself I must confess to something of the Doctors agnosticism
MORRIS Excited and turning almost with a snarl I didnt know you
parsons stuck up for any fables but your own
SMITH I stick up for the thing every man has a right to Perhaps the
only thing that every man has a right to
MORRIS And what is that
SMITH The benefit of the doubt Even your master the petroleum
millionaire has a right to that And I think he needs it more
MORRIS I dont think theres much doubt about the question Minister
Ive met this sort of fellow often enoughthe sort of fellow who
wheedles money out of girls by telling them he can make stones
disappear
DOCTOR To the STRANGER Do you say you can make stones disappear
STRANGER Yes I can make stones disappear
MORRIS Roughly I reckon youre the kind of tough who knows how to
make a watch and chain disappear
STRANGER Yes I know how to make a watch and chain disappear
MORRIS And I should think you were pretty good at disappearing
yourself
STRANGER I have done such a thing
MORRIS With a sneer Will you disappear now
STRANGER After reflection No I think Ill appear instead He
throws back his hood showing the head of an intellectuallooking man
young but rather worn Then he unfastens his cloak and throws it off
emerging in complete modern evening dress He advances down the room
towards the DUKE taking out his watch as he does so Goodevening
your Grace Im afraid Im rather too early for the performance But
this gentleman with a gesture towards MORRIS seemed rather impatient
for it to begin
DUKE Rather at a loss Oh goodevening Why reallyare you
the
STRANGER Bowing Yes I am the Conjurer
There is general laughter except from PATRICIA As the others
mingle in talk the STRANGER goes up to her
STRANGER Very sadly I am very sorry I am not a wizard
PATRICIA I wish you were a thief instead
STRANGER Have I committed a worse crime than thieving
PATRICIA You have committed the cruellest crime I think that there
is
STRANGER And what is the cruellest crime
PATRICIA Stealing a childs toy
STRANGER And what have I stolen
PATRICIA A fairy tale
CURTAIN
ACT II
The same room lighted more brilliantly an hour later in the
evening On one side a table covered with packs of cards pyramids
etc at which the CONJURER in evening dress is standing quietly
setting out his tricks A little more in the foreground the DUKE
and HASTINGS with a number of papers
HASTINGS There are only a few small matters Here are the programmes of
the entertainment your Grace wanted Mr Carleon wishes to see them very
much
DUKE Thanks thanks Takes the programmes
HASTINGS Shall I carry them for your Grace
DUKE No no I shant forget I shant forget Why youve no idea how
businesslike I am We have to be you know Vaguely I know youre a
bit of a Socialist but I assure you theres a good deal to dostake
in the country and all that Look at remembering faces now The King
never forgets faces Waves the programmes about I never forget
faces Catches sight of the CONJURER and genially draws him into the
discussion Why the Professor here who performs before the King
puts down the programmesyou see it on the caravans you
knowperforms before the King almost every night I suppose
CONJURER Smiling I sometimes let his Majesty have an evening off
And turn my attention of course to the very highest nobility But
naturally I have performed before every sovereign potentate white and
black There never was a conjurer who hadnt
DUKE Thats right thats right And youll say with me that the great
business for a King is remembering people
CONJURER I should say it was remembering which people to remember
DUKE Well well now Looks round rather wildly for something
Being really businesslike
HASTINGS Shall I take the programmes for your Grace
DUKE Picking them up No no I shant forget Is there anything
else
HASTINGS I have to go down the village about the wire to Stratford The
only other thing at all urgent is the Militant Vegetarians
DUKE Ah The Militant Vegetarians Youve heard of them Im sure
Wont obey the law to the CONJURER so long as the Government serves
out meat
CONJURER Let them be comforted There are a good many people who dont
get much meat
DUKE Well well Im bound to say theyre very enthusiastic Advanced
toooh certainly advanced Like Joan of Arc
Short silence in which the CONJURER stares at him
CONJURER Was Joan of Arc a Vegetarian
DUKE Oh well its a very high ideal after all The Sacredness of
Life you knowthe Sacredness of Life Shakes his head But they
carry it too far They killed a policeman down in Kent
CONJURER Killed a policeman How Vegetarian Well I suppose it was so
long as they didnt eat him
HASTINGS They are asking only for small subscriptions Indeed they
prefer to collect a large number of halfcrowns to prove the popularity
of their movement But I should advise
