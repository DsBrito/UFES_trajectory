Prefatory Note
In the Metropolitan Magazine where this novel originally appeared
Sep 1834Jan 1836 Marryat prepared his readers for its reception in
the following words
And having now completed Jacob Faithful we trust to the satisfaction
of our readers we will make a few remarks We commenced writing on our
own profession and having completed four tales novels or whatever you
may please to call them viz Frank Mildmay The Kings Own Newton
Forster Peter Simple in Jacob Faithful we quitted the salt water
for the fresh From the wherry we shall now step on shore and in our
next number we shall introduce to our readers The Adventures of
Japhet in search of his Father
The promise was faithfully kept and Japhet with all his varied
experience never went to sea There were indeed few companies on land
to which he did not penetrate Reared in a foundling hospital and
apprenticed to a Smithfield apothecary his good looks impulsive
selfconfidence and unbounded talent for lying carried him with eclat
through the professions of quack doctor juggler and mountebank
gentleman about town tramp and quaker to emerge triumphantly at last
as the only son of a wealthy AngloIndian general or Bengal tiger as
his friends preferred to call him
Japhets adventures of course are shared by a faithful friend and
ally Timothy Oldmixon the Sancho to his Quixote originally an orphan
pauper like himself composed of two qualitiesfun and affection He
encounters villains lawyers kindhearted peers rooks and pigeons
gipsies leaders of fashion fair maidensenough and to spare In a
word Marryat here makes use of wellworn material and uses it well He
has constructed a tale of private adventure on the old familiar lines
in which the local colouracquired from other booksis admirably laid
on and the interest sustained to the end The story is well told
enlivened by humour and very respectably constructed
The reader will find Japhet thoroughly exciting and will have no
difficulty in believing that while it was running in the pages of the
Metropolitan an American vessel meeting an English one in the broad
Atlantic instead of a demand for water or supplies ran up the question
to her masthead Has Japhet found his father yet
Japhet in search of a Father is here reprinted with a few
corrections from the first edition in 3 vols Saunders  Otley 1836
On page 360 a few words enclosed in square brackets have been
inserted from the magazine version as the abbreviated sentence always
hitherto reproduced from the first edition is unintelligible

Japhet in Search of a Father
Chapter I
Like most other children who should be my godfather is decided by
MammonSo precocious as to make some noise in the world and be
hung a few days after I was bornCut down in time and produce a
scene of bloodshedMy early propensities fully developed by the
choice of my profession
Those who may be pleased to honour these pages with a perusal will not
be detained with a long introductory history of my birth parentage and
education The very title implies that at this period of my memoirs I
was ignorant of the two first and it will be necessary for the due
development of my narrative that I allow them to remain in the same
state of bliss for in the perusal of a tale as well as in the
pilgrimage of life ignorance of the future may truly be considered as
the greatest source of happiness The little that was known of me at
this time I will however narrate as concisely and as correctly as I am
able It was on theI really forget the date and must rise from my
chair look for a key open a closet and then open an iron safe to hunt
over a pile of papersit will detain you too longit will be
sufficient to say that it was on a nightbut whether the night was
dark or moonlit or rainy or foggy or cloudy or fine or starlight I
really cannot tell but it is of no very great consequence Well it was
on a night about the hourthere again Im puzzled it might have been
ten or eleven or twelve or between any of these hours nay it might
have been past midnight and far advancing to the morning for what I
know to the contrary The reader must excuse an infant ofthere again
I am at a nonplus but we will assume of some days oldif when wrapped
up in flannel and in a covered basket and moreover fast asleep at the
time he does not exactly observe the state of the weather and the time
by the church clock I never before was aware of the great importance of
dates in telling a story but it is now too late to recover these facts
which have been swept away into oblivion by the broad wing of Time I
must therefore just tell the little I do know trusting to the readers
good nature and to blanks It is as followsthat at the hourof
the nightthe state of the weather being alsoI an infant of a
certain agewas suspended by somebody or somebodiesat the knocker
of the Foundling Hospital Having made me fast the said somebody or
somebodies rang a peal upon the bell which made the old porter start up
in so great a hurry that with the back of his hand he hit his better
half a blow on the nose occasioning a great suffusion of blood from
that organ and a still greater pouring forth of invectives from the
organ immediately below it
All this having been effected by the said peal on the bell the said
somebody or somebodies did incontinently take to their heels and
disappear long before the old porter could pull his legs through his
nether garments and obey the rude summons At last the old man swung
open the gate and the basket swung across his nose he went in again
for a knife and cut me down for it was cruel to hang a baby of a few
days old carried me into the lodge lighted a candle and opened the
basket Thus did I metaphorically first come to light
When he opened the basket I opened my eyes and although I did not
observe it the old woman was standing at the table in very light
attire sponging her nose over a basin
Verily a pretty babe with black eyes exclaimed the old man in a
tremulous voice
Black eyes indeed muttered the old woman I shall have two
tomorrow
Beautiful black eyes indeed continued the old man
Terrible black eyes for sartain continued the old woman as she
sponged away
Poor thing it must be cold murmured the old porter
Warrant I catch my death acold muttered the wife
But dear me heres a paper exclaimed the old man
Vinegar and brown paper echoed the old woman
Addressed to the governors of the hospital continued the porter
Apply to the dispenser of the hospital continued his wife
And sealed said he
Get it healed said she
The linen is good it must be the child of no poor people Who
knowssoliloquised the old man
My poor nose exclaimed the old woman
I must take it to the nurses and the letter I will give tomorrow
said the old porter winding up his portion of this double soliloquy
and tottering away with the basket and your humble servant across the
courtyard
There it will do now said the old wife wiping her face on a towel
and regaining her bed in which she was soon joined by her husband and
they finished their nap without any further interruption during that
night
The next morning I was reported and examined and the letter addressed
to the governors was opened and read It was laconic but still as most
things laconic are very much to the point
This child was born in wedlockhe is to be named Japhet When
circumstances permit he will be reclaimed
But there was a postscript by Abraham Newlands Esq promising to pay
the bearer on demand the sum of fifty pounds In plainer terms there
was a bank note to that amount inclosed in the letter As in general
the parties who suspend children in baskets have long before suspended
cash payments or at all events forget to suspend them with the
baskets my arrival created no little noise to which I added my share
until I obtained a share of the breast of a young woman who like
Charity suckled two or three babies at one time
We have preparatory schools all over the kingdom for young gentlemen
from three to five years of age under ladies and from four to seven
under either or both sexes as it may happen but the most preparatory
of all preparatory schools is certainly the Foundling Hospital which
takes in its pupils if they are sent from one to three days old or
even hours if the parents are in such extreme anxiety about their
education Here it commences with their weaning when they are
instructed in the mystery of devouring pap next they are taught to
walkand as soon as they can walkto sit still to talkand as soon
as they can talkto hold their tongues thus are they instructed and
passed on from one part of the establishment to another until they
finally are passed out of its gates to get on in the world with the
advantages of some education and the still further advantage of having
no father or mother to provide for or relatives to pester them with
their necessities It was so with me I arrived at the age of fourteen
and notwithstanding the promise contained in the letter it appeared
that circumstances did not permit of my being reclaimed But I had a
great advantage over the other inmates of the hospital the fifty pounds
sent with me were not added to the funds of the establishment but
generously employed for my benefit by the governors who were pleased
with my conduct and thought highly of my abilities Instead of being
bound prentice to a cordwainer or some other mechanic by the influence
of the governors added to the fifty pounds and interest as a premium
I was taken by an apothecary who engaged to bring me up to the
profession And now that I am out of the Foundling we must not travel
quite so fast
The practitioner who thus took me by the hand was a Mr Phineas Cophagus
whose house was most conveniently situated for business one side of
the shop looking upon Smithfield Market the other presenting a surface
of glass to the principal street leading out of the same market It was
a corner house but not in a corner On each side of the shop were
two gin establishments and next to them were two publichouses and then
two eatinghouses frequented by graziers butchers and drovers Did
the men drink so much as to quarrel in their cups who was so handy to
plaister up the broken heads as Mr Cophagus Did a fat grazier eat
himself into an apoplexy how very convenient was the ready lancet of Mr
Cophagus Did a bull gore a man Mr Cophagus appeared with his diachylon
and lint Did an ox frighten a lady it was in the back parlour of Mr
Cophagus that she was recovered from her syncope Market days were a
sure market to my master and if an overdriven beast knocked down
others it only helped to set him on his legs Our windows suffered
occasionally but whether it were broken heads or broken limbs or
broken windows they were well paid for Every one suffered but Mr
Phineas Cophagus who never suffered a patient to escape him The shop
had the usual allowance of green yellow and blue bottles and in hot
weather from our vicinity we were visited by no small proportion of
bluebottle flies We had a white horse in one window and a brown horse
in the other to announce to the drovers that we supplied
horsemedicines And we had all the patent medicines in the known world
even to the allsufficient medicine for mankind of Mr Enouy having
which I wondered on my first arrival why we troubled ourselves about
any others The shop was large and at the back part there was a most
capacious iron mortar with a pestle to correspond The first floor was
tenanted by Mr Cophagus who was a bachelor the second floor was let
the others were appropriated to the housekeeper and to those who formed
the establishment In this wellsituated tenement Mr Cophagus got on
swimmingly I will therefore for the present sink the shop that my
master may rise in the estimation of the reader when I describe his
person and his qualifications
Mr Phineas Cophagus might have been about fortyfive years of age when I
first had the honour of an introduction to him in the receiving room of
the Foundling Hospital He was of the middle height his face was thin
his nose very much hooked his eyes small and peering with a
goodhumoured twinkle in them his mouth large and drawn down at one
corner He was stout in his body and carried a considerable
protuberance before him which he was in the habit of patting with his
left hand very complacently but although stout in his body his legs
were mere spindles so that in his appearance he reminded you of some
bird of the crane genus Indeed I may say that his whole figure gave
you just such an impression as an orange might do had it taken to
itself a couple of pieces of tobacco pipes as vehicles of locomotion He
was dressed in a black coat and waistcoat white cravat and high collar
to his shirt blue cotton net pantaloons and Hessian boots both fitting
so tight that it appeared as if he was proud of his spindle shanks His
hat was broadbrimmed and low and he carried a stout black cane with a
gold top in his right hand almost always raising the gold top to his
nose when he spoke just as we see doctors represented at a consultation
in the caricature prints But if his figure was strange his language
and manners were still more so He spoke as some birds fly in jerks
intermixing his words for he never completed a whole sentence with
umumand ending it with so on leaving his hearers to supply
the context from the heads of his discourse Almost always in motion he
generally changed his position as soon as he had finished speaking
walking to any other part of the room with his cane to his nose and
his head cocked on one side with a selfsufficient tiptoe gait When I
was ushered into his presence he was standing with two of the
governors This is the lad said one of them his name is Japhet
Japhet replied Mr Cophagus um scripturalShem Ham umand so
on Boy reads
Very well and writes a very good hand He is a very good boy Mr
Cophagus
Readwritespellgood and so on Bring him
uprudimentsspatulawrite labelsumMD one of these daysmake a
man of himand so on said this strange personage walking round and
round me with his cane to his nose and scrutinising my person with his
twinkling eyes I was dismissed after this examination and approval and
the next day dressed in a plain suit of clothes was delivered by the
porter at the shop of Mr Phineas Cophagus who was not at home when I
arrived
Chapter II
Like all Tyros I find the rudiments of learning extremely
difficult and laborious but advance so rapidly than I can do
without my Master
A tall freshcoloured but hectic looking young man stood behind the
counter making up prescriptions and a dirty lad about thirteen years
old was standing near with his basket to deliver the medicines to the
several addresses as soon as they were ready The young man behind the
counter whose name was Brookes was within eighteen months of serving
his time when his friends intended to establish him on his own account
and this was the reason which induced Mr Cophagus to take me that I
might learn the business and supply his place when he left Mr Brookes
was a very quiet amiable person kind to me and the other boy who
carried out the medicines and who had been taken by Mr Cophagus for
his food and raiment The porter told Mr Brookes who I was and left me
Do you think that you will like to be an apothecary said Mr Brookes
to me with a benevolent smile
Yes I do not see why I should not replied I
Stop a moment said the lad who was waiting with the basket lookly
archly at me you havnt got through your rudimans yet
Hold your tongue Timothy said Mr Brookes That you are not very
fond of the rudiments as Mr Cophagus calls them is very clear Now
walk off as fast as you can with these medicines sir14 Spring
Street 16 Cleaver Street as before and then to John Street 55 Mrs
Smiths Do you understand
To be sure I docant I read I reads all the directions and all your
Latin stuff into the bargainall your summen dusses horez diez
cockly hairy I mean to set up for myself one of these days
Ill knock you down one of these days Mr Timothy if you stay so long
as you do looking at the print shops that you may depend upon
I keep up all my learning that way replied Timothy walking off with
his load turning his head round and laughing at me as he quitted the
shop Mr Brookes smiled but said nothing
As Timothy went out in came Mr Cophagus Heh JaphetI see said he
putting up his cane nothing to dobadmust workumand so on Mr
Brookesboy learn rudimentsgoodand so on Hereupon Mr Cophagus
took his cane from his nose pointed to the large iron mortar and then
walked away into the back parlour Mr Brookes understood his master if
I did not He wiped out the mortar threw in some drugs and showing me
how to use the pestle left me to my work In half an hour I discovered
why it was that Timothy had such an objection to what Mr Cophagus
facetiously termed the rudiments of the profession It was dreadful
hard work for a boy the perspiration ran down me in streams and I
could hardly lift my arms When Mr Cophagus passed through the shop and
looked at me as I continued to thump away with the heavy iron pestle
Goodsaid he byandbyeMDand so on I thought it was a very
rough road to such preferment and I stopped to take a little breath
BythebyJaphetChristian nameand so onsirnameheh
Mr Cophagus wishes to know your other name said Mr Brookes
interpreting
I have omitted to acquaint the reader that sirnames as well as Christian
names are always given to the children at the Foundling and in
consequence of the bank note found in my basket I had been named after
the celebrated personage whose signature it bore Newland is my other
name sir replied I
Newlandhehvery good nameevery body likes to see that nameand
have plenty of them in his pockets tooumvery comfortableand so
on replied Mr Cophagus leaving the shop
I resumed my thumping occupation when Timothy returned with his empty
basket He laughed when he saw me at work Well how do you like the
rudimansand so onheh said he mimicking Mr Cophagus
Not overmuch replied I wiping my face
That was my job before you came I have been more than a year and
never have got out of those rudimans yet and I suppose I never shall
Mr Brookes perceiving that I was tired desired me to leave off an
order which I gladly obeyed and I took my seat in a corner of the shop
There said Timothy laying down his basket no more work for me
hanty prandium is there Mr Brookes
No Tim but post prandium youll post off again
Dinner being ready and Mr Cophagus having returned he and Mr Brookes
went into the back parlour leaving Timothy and me in the shop to
announce customers And I shall take this opportunity of introducing Mr
Timothy more particularly as he will play a very conspicuous part in
this narrative Timothy was short in stature for his age but very
strongly built He had an oval face with a very dark complexion grey
eyes flashing from under their long eyelashes and eyebrows nearly
meeting each other He was marked with the smallpox not so much as to
disfigure him but still it was very perceptible when near to him His
countenance was always lighted up with merriment there was such a
happy devilmaycare expression in his face that you liked him the
first minute that you were in his company and I was intimate with him
immediately
I say Japhet said he where did you come from
The Foundling replied I
Then you have no friends or relations
If I have I do not know where to find them replied I very gravely
Pooh dont be grave upon it I havent any either I was brought up by
the parish in the workhouse I was found at the door of a gentlemans
house who sent me to the overseersI was about a year old then They
call me a foundling but I dont care what they call me so long as they
dont call me too late for dinner Father and mother whoever they were
when they ran away from me didnt run away with my appetite I wonder
how long master means to play with his knife and fork As for Mr
Brookes what he eats wouldnt physic a snipe Whats your other name
Japhet
Newland
Newlandnow you shall have mine in exchange Timothy Oldmixon at your
service They christened me after the workhouse pump which had Timothy
Oldmixon fecit on it and the overseers thought it as good a name to
give me as any other so I was christened after the pumpmaker with some
of the pump water As soon as I was big enough they employed me to pump
all the water for the use of the workhouse I worked at my papa as I
called the pump all day long Few sons worked their father more or
disliked him so much and now Japhet you see from habit Im pumping
you
Youll soon pump dry then for Ive very little to tell you replied
I but tell me what sort of a person is our master
Hes just what you see him never alters hardly ever out of humour
and when he is he is just as odd as ever He very often threatens me
but I have never had a blow yet although Mr Brookes has complained once
or twice
But surely Mr Brookes is not cross
No he is a very good gentleman but sometimes I carry on my rigs a
little too far I must say that For as Mr Brookes says people may die
for want of the medicines because I put down my basket to play Its
very true but I cant give up peg in the ring on that account But
then I only get a box of the ear from Mr Brookes and that goes for
nothing Mr Cophagus shakes his stick and says Bad boybig
stickumwont forgetnext timeand so on continued Timothy
laughing and it is so on to the end of the chapter
By this time Mr Cophagus and his assistant had finished their dinner
and came into the shop The former looked at me put his stick to his
nose Little boysalways hungryumlike good dinnerroast
beefYorkshire puddingand so on and he pointed with the stick to
the back parlour Timothy and I understood him very well this time we
went into the parlour when the housekeeper sat down with us and helped
us She was a terribly cross little old woman but as honest as she was
cross which is all that I shall say in her favour Timothy was no
favourite because he had such a good appetite and it appeared that I
was not very likely to stand well in her good opinion for I also ate a
great deal and every extra mouthful I took I sank in her estimation
till I was nearly at the zero where Timothy had long been for the same
offence but Mr Cophagus would not allow her to stint him saying
Little boys must eator wont growand so on
I soon found out that we were not only well fed but in every other
point well treated and I was very comfortable and happy Mr Brookes
instructed me in the art of labelling and tying up and in a very short
time I was very expert and as Timothy predicted the rudiments were
once more handed over to him Mr Cophagus supplied me with good clothes
but never gave me any pocketmoney and Timothy and I often lamented
that we had not even a halfpenny to spend
Before I had been many months in the shop Mr Brookes was able to leave
when any exigence required his immediate attendance I made up the
pills but he weighed out the quantities in the prescriptions if
therefore any one came in for medicines I desired them to wait the
return of Mr Brookes who would be in very soon One day when Mr
Brookes was out and I was sitting behind the counter Timothy sitting
on it and swinging his legs to and fro both lamenting that we had no
pocketmoney Timothy said Japhet Ive been puzzling my brains how we
can get some money and Ive hit it at last let you and I turn doctors
we wont send all the people away who come when Mr Brookes is out but
well physic them ourselves
I jumped at the idea and he had hardly proposed it when an old woman
came in and addressing Timothy said That she wanted something for
her poor grandchilds sore throat
I dont mix up the medicines maam replied Timothy you must apply
to that gentleman Mr Newland who is behind the counterhe understands
what is good for every bodys complaints
Bless his handsome faceand so young too Why be you a doctor sir
I should hope so replied I what is it you requirea lotion or an
embrocation
I dont understand those hard words but I want some doctors stuff
Very well my good woman I know what is proper replied I assuming
an important air Here Timothy wash out this vial very clean
Yes sir replied Timothy very respectfully
I took one of the measures and putting in a little green a little
blue and a little white liquid from the medicine bottles generally used
by Mr Brookes filled it up with water poured the mixture into the
vial corked and labelled it haustus statim sumendus and handed it
over the counter to the old woman
Is the poor child to take it or is it to rub outside inquired the
old woman
The directions are on the labelbut you dont read Latin
Deary me no Latin and do you understand Latin What a nice clever
boy
I should not be a good doctor if I did not replied I On second
thoughts I considered it advisable and safer that the application
should be external so I translated the label to herHaustus rub
it instatim on the throatsumendus with the palm of the hand
Deary me and does it mean all that How much have I to pay sir
Embrocation is a very dear medicine my good woman it ought to be
eighteenpence but as you are a poor woman I shall only charge you
ninepence
Im sure I thank you kindly replied the old woman putting down the
money and wishing me a good morning as she left the shop
Bravo cried Timothy rubbing his hands its halves Japhet is it
not
Yes I replied but first we must be honest and not cheat Mr
Cophagus the vial is sold you know for one penny and I suppose the
stuff I have taken is not worth a penny more Now if we put aside
twopence for Mr Cophagus we dont cheat him or steal his property
the other sevenpence is of course our ownbeing the profits of the
profession
But how shall we account for receiving the twopence said Timothy
Selling two vials instead of one they are never reckoned you know
That will do capitally cried Timothy and now for halves But this
could not be managed until Timothy had run out and changed the sixpence
we then each had our threepence halfpenny and for once in our lives
could say that we had money in our pockets
Chapter III
I perform a wonderful cure upon St John Longs principle having
little or no principle of my ownI begin to puzzle my head with a
problem of all others most difficult to solve
The success of our first attempt encouraged us to proceed but afraid
that I might do some mischief I asked of Mr Brookes the nature and
qualities of the various medicines as he was mixing the prescriptions
that I might avoid taking any of those which were poisonous Mr Brookes
pleased with my continual inquiries gave me all the information I could
desire and thus I gained not only a great deal of information but
also a great deal of credit with Mr Cophagus to whom Mr Brookes had
made known my diligence and thirst for knowledge
Goodvery good said Mr Cophagus fine boylearns his
businessMD one of these daysride in his coachum and so on
Nevertheless at my second attempt I made an awkward mistake which
