Baird their uncles medical attendant and a stranger whom they had
never seen beforea tall gravelooking man of about thirtyfour
whose mourning was new and who showed a deep interest in what was
going on
Both the man of law and the man of medicine looked nervous and
embarrassed and delayed proceeding to business as long as they
possibly could fumbling with knots of red tape opening the closed
curtains to admit a little more light and then closing them again as
if the light was too strong so that the sisters had time to look at
the stranger and to wonder who he was and what his business could be
there He also seemed to be taking notes of the young ladies in a
quiet timid manner
At last the will was opened and after the usual preamble the lawyers
voice seemed to break a little He cleared his throat and continued in
a lower tone
As I have come to the conclusion that the minds of men and women are
radically the same and as I believe that if the latter are trained in
the same way as the former they will be equally capable of making their
own way in the world I have acted upon this principle in the education
of my two beloved nieces Jane and Alice Melville the only surviving
children of my sister Mary Hogarth and as I foresee that if I were to
leave them wealthy heiresses my purpose would be completely thwarted
by Jane losing her independent character and Alice sinking into a
confirmed invalid and by both being to a dead certainty picked up by
needy spendthrifts who will waste their fortunes and break their
hearts as their father George Melville served my poor foolish
sister I hereby convey and dispose all my property whatsoever and
wheresoever heritable and moveable to Francis Ormistown otherwise
Hogarth at present head clerk in the Bank of Scotland who is my son
by a private irregular marriage contracted with Elizabeth Ormistown on
the ninth day of July 18 and who is my heiratlaw though he would
find it difficult to prove his claim as he knows nothing of the
relation between us and as the only party besides myself cognizant of
the marriage dares not come forward to prove it but whose progress I
have watched with interest who has made an honourable position for
himself without any assistance from me beyond a good education who
has served faithfully and who is likely to rule uprightly who has
raised himself from nameless poverty and whom therefore I judge to
be worthy of wealth and honour Provided always that he shall pay to
Jane and Alice Melville my beloved nieces aforesaid the sum of twelve
pounds a year each in quarterly payments in advance for three years
following my decease when such payments shall cease as by that time I
believe they will be independent in circumstances Provided also that
he shall give to the said Jane and Alice Melville the furniture and
personal effects belonging to them as mentioned more particularly in
the schedule marked A appended to this instrument and that he shall
give to the said Jane and Alice Melville no further assistance either
in money or in moneys worth directly or indirectly whatsoever Also
providing that the said Francis Ormistown otherwise Hogarth shall not
marry either of his cousins the marriage of such near relations being
mischievous and improper
In case of any of these provisions being disregarded by the said
Francis Ormistown otherwise Hogarth all my heritable and moveable
property shall be divided among certain benevolent institutions in the
order and manner set forth in the schedule marked with the letter B
All these provisions I have made as being the best for my surviving
relatives and I believe they will eventually acknowledge them to be
such
It would be hard to say which of the three parties interested felt
most astonishment at this extraordinary will Jane Melville stood rigid
and silent with her face flushed and her eyes filled with tears which
she would not let fall Alices face lost all colour and she seemed
ready to faint But the greatest excitement was shown by the fortunate
legatee He shook from head to foot steadying himself on the
tablelooked from the two girls to the two gentlemen with bewildered
eyesand said at last with difficulty in a low soft tremulous
voice
Was Mr Hogarth in his senses when he made this will
A little excited but indisputably in full possession of his senses
strange as the will appears said Mr MacFarlane the lawyer and Mr
Baird will corroborate my opinion
Mr Baird bowed his head affirmatively Quite truehis head was quite
clear at the time The will was made six weeks ago and you Miss
Melville know how well he was then Very grieved indeedmost
inconceivable conductcruelinconsiderate I feel deeply for your
disappointment Try not to give way Miss Aliceor perhaps you had
better give way it may relieve you Mr MacFarlane tells me that he
remonstrated with Mr Hogarth Most painful dutymust obey
instructions of course Your uncle seemed like adamant I pity you
with all my heart
And so do I with all my heart said Mr MacFarlane
And does no one pity me said the low voice of the heir to all but
it was unheeded for Alice had fainted Her sister and Mr Baird laid
her on the sofa and applied the usual restoratives
Mr MacFarlane began to speak in an undertone to the new master of
the extent and value of the property he had thus suddenly come into
possession of and congratulated him rather stiffly on the turn of
fortune that had raised him from a life of labour and comparative
poverty to ease and affluence but his embarrassment was nothing
compared to that of the man whom he addressed Francis Hogarth looked
round the spacious room and out of the window to the pleasant
shrubbery and smoothshaven lawn and shuddered when he thought of the
two young cousins brought up apparently in the lap of luxury who were
to be turned out upon the world with 12 pounds ayear for three years
The elder sister seemed to have a vigorous and robust constitution but
the younger looked delicate He saw in his minds eye two
governesses dragging out a weary and monotonous existence far from
each other while he possessed of superabundance was debarred from
helping them
He advanced timidly to the sofa Alice who had recovered
consciousness covered her face with both her hands and sobbed aloud
Jane turned towards him a glance not of reproach but of pity He felt
it and took her hand
Believe me Miss Melville no one can regret this extraordinary will
as I do I will overturn it if I possibly can
You cannot said Jane it is quite in keeping with all my uncles
ideasquite consistent with all he has told us over and over again He
had many strange notions but he was generally in the right and it MAY
prove to be so now The sigh that accompanied these words told how
faint her hopes were
It has been positive unkindness to bring you up as he did and now to
throw you upon the world My beginning was different How could he
expect the same success for youwomen too
And are women so inferior then It was my uncles cherished belief
that they were not He said he never saw a woman take up mans work
without succeeding in it I must try to show that I will be no
exception He was not unkind to take us on our mothers death from a
careless and unprincipled father to bring us into a quiet and happy
home to educate us to the best of his judgment to be always kind
always reasonable Ah no my dear uncle though this seems very hard
it was not meant for unkindness
It is cruel cruel said Alice He must have been mad What will
become of us What will become of us
At this burst of despair from Alice Janes courage gave way and the
heavy tears rolled down her cheeks Elsie darling at the worst we
can only die and we are not afraid of death But no we shall live to
conquer all this yet
You cannot as yet lay any plan said Mr Macfarlane Mr
OrmistownMr Hogarth I should sayis in no hurry to take
possession You can have a month to look about you and there is no
saying what may turn up in a month
Certainly said the new cousin I am sure I should be most happy to
give the young ladies accommodation in this large house for as long as
they please if that is not forbidden by the will
A permanent residence is clearly forbidden for no assistance beyond
the small money payment specified Can be offered or accepted but I
think a month to remain and to collect all their wardrobe and personal
property may be permitted
I ought to return to the bank and work till they find a substitute
and will leave my cousins the undisturbed possession of Cross Hall for
a month In the meantime I feel as if my presence must be a painful
intrusion I must leave you
Perhaps said Jane though you cannot give us money you may be able
to give us advice You are going to Edinburgh you may see or hear of
something we could do
I should be most happy to do so What line of life should you like to
enter on
Anything we could make a living by
Then I suppose a governesss situation
I might teach boys but I have not learned what would qualify me to
instruct girls But I do thoroughly understand bookkeeping write a
good hand have gone through Euclid and know as much of the classics
as nine out of ten young men in my rank of life But my uncle cared
very little for the classics I know a good deal of chemistry and
mineralogy but uncle was most pleased with my bookkeeping How did you
get on when you began to work for yourself
I entered the bank as a junior clerk at the age of sixteen and got
30 pounds for the first two years An unknown friendI know now who he
waswho had paid for my education and all other expenses previously
sent me 12 pounds a year for three years to help out my earnings
And you could live on that said Jane
I did live on it somehow said Francis My coats were very
threadbare and my meals scanty but I weathered these three years and
then I got a good step and crept up gradually I have been now in this
same bank for seventeen years and am at present in the receipt of 250
pounds a year thinking myself rich and fortunatenow I am rich and
unfortunate Why did not my father leave me to the career I had made
for myself and you to the inheritance you had been brought up to
expect
Thirty pounds a year to begin with said Jane half aloud 250
pounds after seventeen years work Very sweetall ones own earning
I am not afraid only let Elsie keep up heart
I cannot said Elsie Ill be dead long before seventeen years are
over
I will take good care of you said Jane
How are you to take good care either of yourself or of me if we are
starving said Elsie with a fresh burst of tears
We will do our best So you are going Mr Hogarth Write to me if you
can hear of anything for me I will be much obliged to you Goodbye
Jane shook hands with her cousin kindly and soon after Mr MacFarlane
and Mr Baird also withdrew leaving the sisters alone Elsie wept
till she was completely exhausted while her sister sat at the table
with pen and ink and paper before her but writing nothing
After a while Elsie started up from the sofa Jane said she if we
were to marry it would put an end to all this perplexity It was
strange that uncle put in the clause forbidding us to marry that man
Neither of us would demean ourselves so much but uncle disliked the
marriage of near relatives How strange that so little is said about
the mother I could not look at him but you did Is he like his
father My uncle was a very handsome man I fancy this man is plain
I see little or no likeness to my uncle but he is by no means
plainlooking
Will he get into society Do they consider such people legitimate
The marriage was irregular but legal said Jane I see now the
cause my uncle had to dislike the Scotch marriage law He must have
been made very miserable from some unguarded words spoken or written
but this does not prevent his son taking the position of a legitimate
heir He is quiet and unassuming and will take a very good place in
society
It was well said Elsie with a faint laugh that this clause was
inserted for you seem to be in some danger
Not at all but we were thrown together in very extraordinary
circumstances and I could not help feeling for his position as he felt
for ours Nor could I help asking for advice from him I agree with my
uncle about cousins He was right there as he always used to be At
least he brought me up to think like him and I can scarcely believe
that what he has now done is wrong
But Jane setting this cousin out of the way what do you think of
William Dalzell
I was just thinking of him when you spoke said Jane resolutely
Uncle must have had him in his mind when he mentioned fortunehunters
in his will for he never seemed to like him coming here so often and
just six weeks ago I had been going out riding with him every day You
said you were not well and would not accompany us I suppose I was
giving him what people consider a great deal of encouragement If my
uncle had said plainly that he disapproved of the intimacy I wonder if
I would have given it up Perhaps notone does not like to be dictated
to It appeared to myself so strange that he should prefer me to you
And now I recollect that my uncle must have paid his last visit to
Edinburgh just before he made his will and there he would see this
young man filling his place in the world so well while I was behaving
so foolishly The contrast must have struck him and he certainly has
put an end to everything between Mr Dalzell and myself
Oh Jane he is no fortunehunter this will make no change If you
marry him you must take me home with you and tell him it is what I
deserve for standing his friend so well
My dearest Elsie you have talked a great deal about Mr Dalzell and
I have rather foolishly listened to it but that must be stopped now I
know he is poor he thought to better himself by a wealthy marriage
and perhaps if I had been left now with 20000 pounds with nothing to
do and nothing to think of his agreeable qualities
Well you own he has agreeable qualities
Yes I have always owned itthey might have induced me to marry him
and you as the possessor of other 20000 pounds would have been a
most welcome inmate of our house until you chose for yourself your own
home But now Elsie I know William Dalzell is not the man to encumber
himself with a penniless wife and a penniless sisterinlaw
He is not mercenaryI am sure he is not said Elsie with animation
Perhaps he is not positively mercenary but after all am I worthy of
the sacrifice Look at me Elsie even your sisterly partiality cannot
make a beauty of me My turn of mind is not suited to his I have
always felt that and above all I am not very fond of him
Not very
No I have liked him a good deal but now in this crisis when we have
to begin life in earnestwhen I am puzzling myself how to find food
and clothing and shelter for you and meI feel as if Mr Dalzells
past attentions belonged to another world altogether so I am putting
them aside completely
Ah but Jane only listen to me If he were to come now and lay
himself and all that he has at your feet that would prove that he was
no fortunehunter but a real true lover as I always believed him to
be
He will not do it said Jane quietly and she now began to make some
memoranda
We have no ornaments Elsie said she sadly
No I never heard you regret the want of them before
I should like to have something to sell Emilia Chalmers has 200
pounds worth of jewellery most of it left by her aunt If we had so
much we might convert it into money and might stock a little shop
A shop said Elsie shuddering
Why not One is more independent keeping a shop than in a governesss
situation and there my business knowledge would be of use It is wrong
and absurd to have a terror of a shop
I cannot help feeling a great repugnance to shopkeeping
Then would you rather be a governess supposing you were capable
Oh Jane that is such a hard life I should be separated from you
and then one is worried by the children and snubbed by the parents
sneered at by servants and ignored by visitors
Then dressmaking You work beautifully
The late hours and the close rooms do you think I could stand it
I am a little afraid for you said Jane thoughtfully What would
you like to do
Why I have never thought of doing anything but being with you
working a little reading a little going out a little and having
nobody over me but you my own darling sister It stuns me to be told
that I must go to work for a livelihood
I hope we may be able to live together as you hoped eventually but
in the meantime we must both put our shoulders to the wheel
Have we no friends who would give us a homeat least for a while
till we get accustomed to the thought of hard work said Elsie
We have no relations and we have made but few friends I fear no one
would come forward to help us now that we need help so much It is a
pity that my uncle kept us so much to himself and that we were so
fully occupied with our own home duties that we had little or no time
for society Now we have no capital for a start and no friends to help
us on only our talents and our educationa small stockintrade I
fear
In the course of the afternoon the manservant James announced that
Mr Dalzell was below and that he sent his compliments and wished to
know how the young ladies were
It was not the first visit since Mr Hogarths death He had paid a
visit of condolence on the following day and had never been so
affectionate or impressive in his manner to Jane as on that occasion
Show Mr Dalzell upstairs James said Jane I think I should like
to see him
The man looked somewhat intelligent and obeyed
I cannot see anybodyI am not fit to be seen said Elsie retreating
in haste from the room and indeed Jane I wonder at you wishing to
see him so soon after this dreadful news
He has been at the funeral I suppose It is very proper of him to
inquire for us and very imperative that we should understand each
otherthe sooner the better But do not stay if you do not like I
should prefer to see him alone
Mr Dalzell was shown into the darkened drawingroom where he was some
time in discovering that Miss Melville was alone A few of the kind
commonplaces which had been so successful on his previous
visitremarks on the loss she had sustained on the excellent
character of her deceased uncle and on the necessity of bearing the
blow with fortitude which her strong mind was quite capable ofwere
made by Mr Dalzell in unconsciousness that they fell very differently
on Janes ears now Jane asked for his mother and heard that she was
very well and sent her kindest regards and condolences and hoped that
the Misses Melville would be able to see her on the following day
Were there many people at the funeral asked Jane
Oh yes a great man Mr Hogarth was so extensively known and so much
respected
Were there any strangers
Severalto me said Dalzell
Did you observe no one in particular
Yes a gentleman from Edinburgh said to be a PROTEGE of your uncles
who took rather a prominent place on account of there being no male
relative surviving
Have you heard said Jane with an efforthave you heard anything
of the will
Nothing whateverdid not think it proper or delicate to inquire
though I saw Mr MacFarlane after it had been read It is a matter of
no consequence to me how Mr Hogarth has left his property My feelings
will be quite the same towards
Stop said Jane my uncle has left his entire fortune to this
stranger from Edinburgh who is his son by a private marriage Elsie
and I have had an education and must make the best we can of it
Miss Melville this is incrediblequite incredible You are merely
trying me Mr Hogarth was incapable of such madness and injustice It
is not treating me well to play upon me in this way
In proof of what I say here is a certified copy of the willthe
final willexecuted six weeks ago when as you know my uncle was
perfectly well both in body and mind It is incontestable
The bewildered young man tried to read the paper put into his hand but
he could not follow the written words Janes sad face and her manner
convinced him however that she was telling him the truth
Now said Jane kindly you have talked a great deal of nonsense to
me when my position was very different but I am quite aware that
things are altogether changed I will not feel at all hurt or angry
about it We part perfectly good friends But you cannot afford to
marry a wife without money and I should be sorry to be a burden to any
man
William Dalzell looked at the girl he had fancied himself in love with
for the last few months and felt that his love had not been of a very
deep or absorbing character If the two girls had been equal favourites
of their uncles his choice would have fallen on Elsie who was
prettier more elegant more yielding and as he thought more
affectionate Her impulsive and confiding manner her little
enthusiasms her blunders were to him more charming than Janes steady
good sense and calm temper Jane never wanted advice or assistance she
was too independent in mind and too robust in body to care much about
little attentions though she had become accustomed to his in the
course of time and as there was no other person to compare him with
had allowed herself to think a good deal of him Mr Hogarth had always
shown so marked a preference for Jane and had so often expressed
displeasure and impatience at Elsies deficiencies his property not
being entailed was entirely at his own disposal so that it was
probable that Jane would be left the larger share of it while if he
made love to Alice it was quite possible that she would be disinherited
altogether for he knew that he was not a favourite with the old
gentleman He did not think that anything could shake Mr Hogarths
confidence in Jane and he had been very careful in feeling his ground
sure before he made a formal proposal He had tried to persuade himself
that Janes face was charming though not regularly handsome so it was
to some people but he had not eyes to see the charm Her figure was
undeniably fine her temper good her principles to be depended on Her
education had been peculiar and singularly secularhis mother had
felt a little shocked at her want of religionbut then Mr Hogarth was
very odd and when she was married she would see things differently
and on the whole Mrs Dalzell felt that her handsome son had chosen
with great prudence and good sense in fixing his affections upon the
elder and the favorite niece His small property was heavily
encumbered and such a marriage would make him hold up his head again
in the country Mrs Dalzells attentions to Jane had been nearly as
assiduous as her sons and to the motherless girl they were quite as
welcome and she had shown so much affection for Alice too that both
sisters had been very much captivated with her
William Dalzell felt Janes kindlymeant speech as a sort of reproach
He would have preferred to make a speech himself and to have seen her
more agitated Though he had never thought himself very much in love
he believed he had inspired a strong love and that it would be very
hard for Jane to give him up But things were completely taken out of
his hands she did not even now in the first pain of parting dream of
breaking her heart She was his superior painfully his superior and
he did not like it
You are quite right Miss Melville said he what you say is quite
true I am involved and embarrassed and could not offer you anything
worth having
And I will make my own way in the world said Jane and William
Dalzell do not be hurt if I give you one friendly piece of advice on
partingtry to make your own way in the world too Shake yourself
clear of your own embarrassments by your own industrya far better way
than by marrying a rich wife
She looked very kindly at the young man as she spoke but he did not
take the advice in the friendly spirit in which it was given He
answered rather shortly that he dared to say he would do as well as
other people and then began to ask what she knew about the heir if
she had ever seen him before or heard Mr Hogarth speak of him She
answered
No never but I cannot answer questions I cannot converse rationally
any longer You had better go away Mr Dalzell and let me have a
little rest for I am rather weary
The young gentleman stumbled down stairs and rode home ruminating over
the downfall of all his cherished expectations while Jane said to
herself It is over and it is better so He really is a smaller
character than I thought he was
Chapter II
Disappointment and Hope Prose and Poetry
When Jane Melville told her cousin that her uncle had been always kind
and always reasonable she expressed her own opinion for she had loved
and honoured him so much that she felt no hardship in doing everything
he wished but no one else in the house or in the neighbourhood would
have endorsed that opinion When the rumour spread far and wide that he
had disinherited his nieces in the expectation that the education he
had given them would enable them to provide handsomely for themselves
the servants and workpeople about shook their heads and said it was
aye weel kenned that the auld laird had a bee in his bonnet while
the class with whom Mr Hogarth associated on more equal terms
declared that this last eccentricity of affection for it was all done
out of pure love surpassed all his other oddities with regard to the
girls which had long been the talk of the whole country
They had as Jane sadly confessed made but few friends Their uncles
reasonable prejudices extended to morning visits which he called a
frivolous waste of time and he had a similar dislike to evening
parties not on account of a puritanic disapproval of dancing or of
young people of different sexes meeting and having opportunities of
getting acquainted with each other but the hours were so irrational
and the conventional dress so unbecoming and dangerous to health that
he had prohibited Jane and Elsie from accepting the invitations that
were showered on them when they had given up lessons and were supposed
to be ready to come out If people would meet at six and break up
before twelve and wear dresses fashioned like their ordinary attire
Mr Hogarth saw no objection to evening parties He had invited the
neighbours to such a party and mentioned in his note of invitation the
conditions on which it was to be attended A good many had accepted
partly from curiosity and partly from a wish to be friendly but in
spite of really good arrangements and an excellent supper the party
was not such a success as to be repeated often by Mr Hogarth and was
never imitated by any of his guests
The Misses Melville danced well walked well and rode admirably they
spent several hours every day in the open air had learnt to swim and
to shoot both with bow and arrow and with rifle Their physical
education had been excellent and had probably saved Elsies life for
she was extremely delicate when young but had gained strength as she
grew up
Their book education had been chiefly conducted by an old gentleman
who had lived for eight years in their house as tutor and they had
spent several winters in Edinburgh to attend classes and lectures No
money no care and no time had been spared on their education so that
it was rather a pity that in the eyes of the world it was so
unsatisfactory when completed Both had gone through the same routine
for Mr Hogarth seemed to think that education made characters instead
of merely drawing out what there is in the original material and he
was disappointed that the uniformity of the training had not produced
two characters more similar than those of Jane and Elsie Janes
tendencies were to the practical and the positive and she gladly
availed herself of her uncles whim to educate her like a man of
business regretting none of the accomplishments and showy acquirements
which are too apt to be considered the principal part of female
education Expecting that she would be left in possession of
considerable property and virtually the guardian of her younger
sister she saw a fitness and propriety in her being taught the
management of money the science of agriculture the care of an
establishment and the accurate keeping of accounts
Elsie would have preferred another training but it was not given to
her and though she made but a lame attempt to follow Janes footsteps
and acquired only a superficial knowledge of what her sister was the
perfect mistress of her uncle believed that bad as she was she would
have been much worse if she had not been forced into rational studies
Though she was not a marvel of solidity she still had as good a
knowledge of accounts general information history and science as is
possessed by many boys who get on very well in business or in
professions when once set fairly to work
Mr Hogarth had no great opinion of the value of teaching languages
and thought that a knowledge of things was of far more importance than
a knowledge of the names of things The girls had learned however a
good deal of Latin and Greek from Mr Wilson their tutor who thought
it a pity that Janes fine abilities should not have a classical
education and he had induced Mr Hogarth to agree to it by the
argument that these languages are invaluable for the ready and correct
understanding of all scientific terms French and Italian the girls
themselves were anxious to learn and as they had been promised a
continental tour some fine summer their uncle thought they might be
useful acquirements then so they had lessons from the best masters in
Edinburgh and profited by them And here for the first time Elsies
progress had been far greater than Janes Mr Hogarth had himself
spent a good deal of time in his youth in France but he had a higher
opinion of French society than of French literature and he thought
that from the lips of brilliant Parisian women they would learn more of
the spirit of the language and of the people than from the books they
studied in classes or read at home
Elsie had a natural taste for music and a remarkably sweet voice in
speaking which if it had been cultivated would have made her an
excellent singer but her uncle was sure that to indulge her with a
musical education would only weaken her mind Mr Hogarth had seen no
good come of music A taste for singing and a fine voice had been the
