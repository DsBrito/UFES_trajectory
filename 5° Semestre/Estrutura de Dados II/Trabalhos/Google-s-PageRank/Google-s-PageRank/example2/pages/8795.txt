Descended like his locks which parting fell
Upon his breast in double fold  The beams
Of those four luminaries on his face
So brightly shone and with such radiance clear
Deckd it that I beheld him as the sun
Say who are ye that stemming the blind stream
Forth from th eternal prisonhouse have fled
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes
Who hath conducted or with lantern sure
Lights you emerging from the depth of night
That makes the infernal valley ever black
Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss
Broken or in high heaven new laws ordaind
That thus condemnd ye to my caves approach
My guide then laying hold on me by words
And intimations given with hand and head
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay
Due reverence then thus to him replied
Not of myself I come a Dame from heaven
Descending had besought me in my charge
To bring  But since thy will implies that more
Our true condition I unfold at large
Mine is not to deny thee thy request
This mortal neer hath seen the farthest gloom
But erring by his folly had approachd
So near that little space was left to turn
Then as before I told I was dispatchd
To work his rescue and no way remaind
Save this which I have taen  I have displayd
Before him all the regions of the bad
And purpose now those spirits to display
That under thy command are purgd from sin
How I have brought him would be long to say
From high descends the virtue by whose aid
I to thy sight and hearing him have led
Now may our coming please thee  In the search
Of liberty he journeys that how dear
They know who for her sake have life refusd
Thou knowest to whom death for her was sweet
In Utica where thou didst leave those weeds
That in the last great day will shine so bright
For us the eternal edicts are unmovd
He breathes and I am free of Minos power
Abiding in that circle where the eyes
Of thy chaste Marcia beam who still in look
Prays thee O hallowd spirit to own her shine
Then by her love we implore thee let us pass
Through thy sevn regions for which best thanks
I for thy favour will to her return
If mention there below thou not disdain
Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found
He then to him rejoind while I was there
That all she askd me I was fain to grant
Now that beyond the accursed stream she dwells
She may no longer move me by that law
Which was ordaind me when I issued thence
Not so if Dame from heaven as thou sayst
Moves and directs thee then no flattery needs
Enough for me that in her name thou ask
Go therefore now and with a slender reed
See that thou duly gird him and his face
Lave till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence
For not with eye by any cloud obscurd
Would it be seemly before him to come
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven
This islet all around there far beneath
Where the wave beats it on the oozy bed
Produces store of reeds No other plant
Coverd with leaves or hardend in its stalk
There lives not bending to the waters sway
After this way return not but the sun
Will show you that now rises where to take
The mountain in its easiest ascent
He disappeard and I myself upraisd
Speechless and to my guide retiring close
Toward him turnd mine eyes  He thus began
My son observant thou my steps pursue
We must retreat to rearward for that way
The champain to its low extreme declines
The dawn had chasd the matin hour of prime
Which deaf before it so that from afar
I spyd the trembling of the ocean stream
We traversd the deserted plain as one
Who wanderd from his track thinks every step
Trodden in vain till he regain the path
When we had come where yet the tender dew
Strove with the sun and in a place where fresh
The wind breathd oer it while it slowly dried
Both hands extended on the watery grass
My master placd in graceful act and kind
Whence I of his intent before apprizd
Stretchd out to him my cheeks suffusd with tears
There to my visage he anew restord
That hue which the dun shades of hell conceald
Then on the solitary shore arrivd
That never sailing on its waters saw
Man that could after measure back his course
He girt me in such manner as had pleasd
Him who instructed and O strange to tell
As he selected every humble plant
Wherever one was pluckd another there
Resembling straightway in its place arose
CANTO II
Now had the sun to that horizon reachd
That covers with the most exalted point
Of its meridian circle Salems walls
And night that opposite to him her orb
Sounds from the stream of Ganges issued forth
Holding the scales that from her hands are droppd
When she reigns highest so that where I was
Auroras white and vermeiltincturd cheek
To orange turnd as she in age increasd
Meanwhile we lingerd by the waters brink
Like men who musing on their road in thought
Journey while motionless the body rests
When lo as near upon the hour of dawn
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam
Glares down in west over the ocean floor
So seemd what once again I hope to view
A light so swiftly coming through the sea
No winged course might equal its career
From which when for a space I had withdrawn
Thine eyes to make inquiry of my guide
Again I lookd and saw it grown in size
And brightness thou on either side appeard
Something but what I knew not of bright hue
And by degrees from underneath it came
Another  My preceptor silent yet
Stood while the brightness that we first discernd
Opend the form of wings then when he knew
The pilot cried aloud Down down bend low
Thy knees behold Gods angel fold thy hands
Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed
Lo how all human means he sets at naught
So that nor oar he needs nor other sail
Except his wings between such distant shores
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them reard
Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change
As more and more toward us came more bright
Appeard the bird of God nor could the eye
Endure his splendor near I mine bent down
He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
And light that in its course no wave it drank
The heavnly steersman at the prow was seen
Visibly written blessed in his looks
Within a hundred spirits and more there sat
In Exitu Israel de Aegypto
All with one voice together sang with what
In the remainder of that hymn is writ
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross
He blessd them they at once leapd out on land
The swiftly as he came returnd The crew
There left appeard astounded with the place
Gazing around as one who sees new sights
From every side the sun darted his beams
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heavn
Had chasd the Capricorn when that strange tribe
Lifting their eyes towards us If ye know
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount
Them Virgil answerd  Ye suppose perchance
Us well acquainted with this place but here
We as yourselves are strangers  Not long erst
We came before you but a little space
By other road so rough and hard that now
The ascent will seem to us as play  The spirits
Who from my breathing had perceivd I livd
Grew pale with wonder  As the multitude
Flock round a herald sent with olive branch
To hear what news he brings and in their haste
Tread one another down een so at sight
Of me those happy spirits were fixd each one
Forgetful of its errand to depart
Where cleansd from sin it might be made all fair
Then one I saw darting before the rest
With such fond ardour to embrace me I
To do the like was movd  O shadows vain
Except in outward semblance thrice my hands
I claspd behind it they as oft returnd
Empty into my breast again  Surprise
I needs must think was painted in my looks
For that the shadow smild and backward drew
To follow it I hastend but with voice
Of sweetness it enjoind me to desist
Then who it was I knew and prayd of it
To talk with me it would a little pause
It answered Thee as in my mortal frame
I lovd so loosd forth it I love thee still
And therefore pause but why walkest thou here
Not without purpose once more to return
Thou findst me my Casella where I am
Journeying this way I said but how of thee
Hath so much time been lost  He answerd straight
No outrage hath been done to me if he
Who when and whom he chooses takes me oft
This passage hath denied since of just will
His will he makes  These three months past indeed
He whose chose to enter with free leave
Hath taken whence I wandring by the shore
Where Tybers wave grows salt of him gaind kind
Admittance at that rivers mouth towrd which
His wings are pointed for there always throng
All such as not to Archeron descend
Then I If new laws have not quite destroyd
Memory and use of that sweet song of love
That while all my cares had power to swage
Please thee with it a little to console
My spirit that incumberd with its frame
Travelling so far of pain is overcome
Love that discourses in my thoughts  He then
Began in such soft accents that within
The sweetness thrills me yet  My gentle guide
And all who came with him so well were pleasd
That seemd naught else might in their thoughts have room
Fast fixd in mute attention to his notes
We stood when lo that old man venerable
Exclaiming How is this ye tardy spirits
What negligence detains you loitring here
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal
As a wild flock of pigeons to their food
Collected blade or tares without their pride
Accustomd and in still and quiet sort
If aught alarm them suddenly desert
Their meal assaild by more important care
So I that newcome troop beheld the song
Deserting hasten to the mountains side
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not
Nor with less hurried step did we depart
CANTO III
Them sudden flight had scatterd over the plain
Turnd towrds the mountain whither reasons voice
Drives us I to my faithful company
Adhering left it not  For how of him
Deprivd might I have sped or who beside
Would oer the mountainous tract have led my steps
He with the bitter pang of selfremorse
Seemd smitten  O clear conscience and upright
How doth a little fling wound thee sore
Soon as his feet desisted slackning pace
From haste that mars all decency of act
My mind that in itself before was wrapt
Its thoughts expanded as with joy restord
And full against the steep ascent I set
My face where highest to heavn its top oerflows
The sun that flard behind with ruddy beam
Before my form was broken for in me
His rays resistance met  I turnd aside
With fear of being left when I beheld
Only before myself the ground obscurd
When thus my solace turning him around
Bespake me kindly Why distrustest thou
Believst not I am with thee thy sure guide
It now is evening there where buried lies
The body in which I cast a shade removd
To Naples from Brundusiums wall  Nor thou
Marvel if before me no shadow fall
More than that in the sky element
One ray obstructs not other  To endure
Torments of heat and cold extreme like frames
That virtue hath disposd which how it works
Wills not to us should be reveald  Insane
Who hopes our reason may that space explore
Which holds three persons in one substance knit
Seek not the wherefore race of human kind
Could ye have seen the whole no need had been
For Mary to bring forth  Moreover ye
Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly
To whose desires repose would have been givn
That now but serve them for eternal grief
I speak of Plato and the Stagyrite
And others many more  And then he bent
Downwards his forehead and in troubled mood
Broke off his speech  Meanwhile we had arrivd
Far as the mountains foot and there the rock
Found of so steep ascent that nimblest steps
To climb it had been vain  The most remote
Most wild untrodden path in all the tract
Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this
A ladder easy and open of access
Who knows on which hand now the steep declines
My master said and pausd so that he may
Ascend who journeys without aid of wine
And while with looks directed to the ground
The meaning of the pathway he explord
And I gazd upward round the stony height
Of spirits that toward us movd their steps
Yet moving seemd not they so slow approachd
I thus my guide addressd Upraise thine eyes
Lo that way some of whom thou mayst obtain
Counsel if of thyself thou findst it not
Straightway he lookd and with free speech replied
Let us tend thither they but softly come
And thou be firm in hope my son belovd
Now was that people distant far in space
A thousand paces behind ours as much
As at a throw the nervous arm could fling
When all drew backward on the messy crags
Of the steep bank and firmly stood unmovd
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look
O spirits perfect  O already chosen
Virgil to them began by that blest peace
Which as I deem is for you all prepard
Instruct us where the mountain low declines
So that attempt to mount it be not vain
For who knows most him loss of time most grieves
As sheep that step from forth their fold by one
Or pairs or three at once meanwhile the rest
Stand fearfully bending the eye and nose
To ground and what the foremost does that do
The others gathring round her if she stops
Simple and quiet nor the cause discern
So saw I moving to advance the first
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait
When they before me had beheld the light
From my right side fall broken on the ground
So that the shadow reachd the cave they stoppd
And somewhat back retird the same did all
Who followd though unweeting of the cause
Unaskd of you yet freely I confess
This is a human body which ye see
That the suns light is broken on the ground
Marvel not but believe that not without
Virtue derivd from Heaven we to climb
Over this wall aspire  So them bespake
My master and that virtuous tribe rejoind
Turn and before you there the entrance lies
Making a signal to us with bent hands
Then of them one began  Whoeer thou art
Who journeyst thus this way thy visage turn
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen
I towrds him turnd and with fixd eye beheld
Comely and fair and gentle of aspect
He seemd but on one brow a gash was markd
When humbly I disclaimd to have beheld
Him ever Now behold  he said and showd
High on his breast a wound then smiling spake
I am Manfredi grandson to the Queen
Costanza whence I pray thee when returnd
To my fair daughter go the parent glad
Of Aragonia and Sicilias pride
And of the truth inform her if of me
Aught else be told  When by two mortal blows
My frame was shatterd I betook myself
Weeping to him who of free will forgives
My sins were horrible but so wide arms
Hath goodness infinite that it receives
All who turn to it  Had this text divine
Been of Cosenzas shepherd better scannd
Who then by Clement on my hunt was set
Yet at the bridges head my bones had lain
Near Benevento by the heavy mole
Protected but the rain now drenches them
And the wind drives out of the kingdoms bounds
Far as the stream of Verde where with lights
Extinguishd he removd them from their bed
Yet by their curse we are not so destroyd
But that the eternal love may turn while hope
Retains her verdant blossoms  True it is
That such one as in contumacy dies
Against the holy church though he repent
Must wander thirtyfold for all the time
In his presumption past if such decree
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss
Revealing to my good Costanza how
Thou hast beheld me and beside the terms
Laid on me of that interdict for here
By means of those below much profit comes
CANTO IV
When by sensations of delight or pain
That any of our faculties hath seizd
Entire the soul collects herself it seems
She is intent upon that power alone
And thus the error is disprovd which holds
The soul not singly lighted in the breast
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turnd
Time passes and a man perceives it not
For that whereby he hearken is one power
Another that which the whole spirit hash
This is as it were bound while that is free
This found I true by proof hearing that spirit
And wondring for full fifty steps aloft
The sun had measurd unobservd of me
When we arrivd where all with one accord
The spirits shouted Here is what ye ask
A larger aperture ofttimes is stoppd
With forked stake of thorn by villager
When the ripe grape imbrowns than was the path
By which my guide and I behind him close
Ascended solitary when that troop
Departing left us  On Sanleos road
Who journeys or to Noli low descends
Or mounts Bismantuas height must use his feet
But here a man had need to fly I mean
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire
Conducted by his aid who gave me hope
And with light furnishd to direct my way
We through the broken rock ascended close
Pent on each side while underneath the ground
Askd help of hands and feet  When we arrivd
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank
Where the plain level opend I exclaimd
O master say which way can we proceed
He answerd Let no step of thine recede
Behind me gain the mountain till to us
Some practisd guide appear  That eminence
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point
And the side proudly rising more than line
From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn
I wearied thus began Parent belovd
Turn and behold how I remain alone
If thou stay not My son  He straight replyd
Thus far put forth thy strength and to a track
Pointed that on this side projecting round
Circles the hill  His words so spurrd me on
That I behind him clambring forcd myself
Till my feet pressd the circuit plain beneath
There both together seated turnd we round
To eastward whence was our ascent and oft
Many beside have with delight lookd back
First on the nether shores I turnd my eyes
Then raisd them to the sun and wondring markd
That from the left it smote us  Soon perceivd
That Poet sage now at the car of light
Amazd I stood where twixt us and the north
Its course it enterd  Whence he thus to me
Were Ledas offspring now in company
Of that broad mirror that high up and low
Imparts his light beneath thou mightst behold
The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears
Wheel if its ancient course it not forsook
How that may be if thou wouldst think within
Pondring imagine Sion with this mount
Placd on the earth so that to both be one
Horizon and two hemispheres apart
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew
To guide his erring chariot thou wilt see
How of necessity by this on one
He passes while by that on the other side
If with clear view shine intellect attend
Of truth kind teacher  I exclaimd so clear
Aught saw I never as I now discern
Where seemd my ken to fail that the mid orb
Of the supernal motion which in terms
Of art is called the Equator and remains
Ever between the sun and winter for the cause
Thou hast assignd from hence toward the north
Departs when those who in the Hebrew land
Inhabit see it towrds the warmer part
But if it please thee I would gladly know
How far we have to journey for the hill
Mounts higher than this sight of mine can mount
He thus to me Such is this steep ascent
That it is ever difficult at first
But more a man proceeds less evil grows
When pleasant it shall seem to thee so much
That upward going shall be easy to thee
As in a vessel to go down the tide
Then of this path thou wilt have reachd the end
There hope to rest thee from thy toil  No more
I answer and thus far for certain know
As he his words had spoken near to us
A voice there sounded Yet ye first perchance
May to repose you by constraint be led
At sound thereof each turnd and on the left
A huge stone we beheld of which nor I
Nor he before was ware  Thither we drew
find there were some who in the shady place
Behind the rock were standing as a man
Thru idleness might stand  Among them one
Who seemd to me much wearied sat him down
And with his arms did fold his knees about
Holding his face between them downward bent
Sweet Sir  I cryd behold that man who shows
Himself more idle than if laziness
Were sister to him  Straight he turnd to us
And oer the thigh lifting his face observd
Then in these accents spake Up then proceed
Thou valiant one  Straight who it was I knew
Nor could the pain I felt for want of breath
Still somewhat urgd me hinder my approach
And when I came to him he scarce his head
Uplifted saying Well hast thou discernd
How from the left the sun his chariot leads
His lazy acts and broken words my lips
To laughter somewhat movd when I began
Belacqua now for thee I grieve no more
But tell why thou art seated upright there
Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence
Or blame I only shine accustomd ways
Then he My brother of what use to mount
When to my suffering would not let me pass
The bird of God who at the portal sits
Behooves so long that heavn first bear me round
Without its limits as in life it bore
Because I to the end repentant Sighs
Delayd if prayer do not aid me first
