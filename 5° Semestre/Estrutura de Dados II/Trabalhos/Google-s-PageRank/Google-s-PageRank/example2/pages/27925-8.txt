DISAPPEARANCE
THE ART OF DISAPPEARING
CHAPTER I
THE HOLY OILS
Horace Endicott once believed that life began for him the day he married
Sonia Westfield The ten months spent with the young wife were of a hue
so roseate as to render discussion of the point foolish His youth had
been a happy one of the roystering innocent kind noisy with yachting
baseball and a moderate quantity of college beer but clean as if his
mother had supervised it yet he had never really lived in his
twentyfive years until the blessed experience of a long honeymoon and
a little housekeeping with Sonia had woven into his life the light of
sun and moon and stars together However as he admitted long
afterwards his mistake was as terrible as convincing Life began for
him that day he sat in the railway carriage across the aisle from
distinguished Monsignor ODonnell prelate of the Popes household
doctor in theology and vicargeneral of the New York diocese The train
being on its way to Boston and the journey dull Horace whiled away a
slow hour watching the Monsignor and wondering what motives govern the
activity of the priests of Rome The priest was a handsome man of fifty
darkhaired of an ascetic pallor but undoubtedly practical as his
quick and businesslike movements testified His dark eyes were of fine
color and expression and his manners showed the gentleman
Some years ago thought Horace I would have studied his person for
indications of hoofs and hornsso strangely was I brought up He is
just a poor fellow like myselfit is as great a mistake to make these
men demigods as to make them demidevilsand he denies himself a wife
as a Prohibitionist denies himself a drink He goes through his
mummeries as honestly as a parson through his sermons or a dervish
through his dancesits all one and we must allow for it in the
makeup of human nature One man has his parson another his priest a
third his dervishand I have Sonia
This satisfactory conclusion he dwelt upon lovingly unconscious that
the Monsignor was now observing him in turn
A fine boy the priest thought with man written all over him
Honest face virtuous expression daring too lovinghearted lovable
clever Im sure and his life has been too easy to develop any marked
character Too young to have been in the war but you may be sure he
wanted to go and his mother had to exercise her authority to keep him
at home He has been enjoying me for an hour Im as pleasant as a
puzzle to him  he preferred to read me rather than Dickens and I
gather from his expression that he has solved me By this time I am
rated in his mind as an impostor Oh the children of the Mayflower how
hard for them to see anything in life except through the portholes of
that ship
With a sigh the priest returned to his book and the two gentlemen
having had their fill of speculation forgot each other directly and
forever At this point the accident occurred The slow train ran into a
train ahead which should have been farther on at that moment All the
passengers rose up suddenly without any ceremony quite speechless and
flew up the car like sparrows Then the car turned on its left side and
Horace rolled into the outstretched arms and elevated legs of Monsignor
ODonnell He was kicked and embraced at the same moment receiving
these attentions in speechless awe as he could not recall who was to
blame for the introduction and the attitude For a moment he reasoned
that they had become the object of most outrageous ridicule from the
other passengers for these latter had suddenly set up a shouting and
screeching very scandalous Horace wondered if the priest would help him
to resent this storm of insult and he raised himself off the
Monsignors face and removed the rest of his person from the
Monsignors body in order the more politely to invite him to the
battle Then he discovered the state of things in general The
overthrown car was at a standstill That no one was hurt seemed happily
clear from the vigorous yells of everybody and the fine scramble
through the carwindows The priest got up leisurely and felt himself
Next he seized his satchel eagerly
Now it was more than an accident that I brought the holy oils along
said he to Horace I was vexed to find them where they shouldnt be
yet see how soon I find use for them Someone must be badly hurt in this
disaster and of course itll be one of my own
I hope said the other politely that I did you no harm in falling on
you I could not very well help it
Fortune was kinder to you than if the train rolled over the other way
Dont mention it my son Ill forgive you if you will find me the way
out and learn if any have been injured
The window was too small for a man of the Monsignors girth but through
the rear door the two crawled out comfortably Monsignor dragging the
satchel and murmuring cheerfully How lucky the holy oils It was
just sundown and the wrecked train lay in a meadow with a pretty
stream running by whose placid ripplings mocked the tumult of the
mortals examining their injuries in the field Yet no one had been
seriously injured Bruises and cuts were plentiful some fainted from
shock but each was able to do for himself not so much as a bone having
been broken For a few minutes the Monsignor rejoiced that he would have
no use for what he called the holy oils Then a trainman came running
white and brokentongued crying out There was a priest on the
trainwho has seen him It turned out that the fireman had been caught
in the wrecked locomotive and crushed to death
And its a priest hes cryin for sir groaned the trainman as he
came up to the Monsignor The dying man lay in the shade of some trees
beside the stream and a lovely woman had his head in her lap and wept
silently while the poor boy gasped every now and then mother and the
priest She wiped the deathdew from his face from which the soot had
been washed with water from the stream and moistened his lips with a
cordial He was a youth of the kind that should not die too early so
vigorous was his young body so manly and true his dear face but it was
only a matter of ten minutes stay beside the little stream for Tim
Hurley The group about him made way for Monsignor who sank on his
knees beside him and held up the boys face to the fading light
The priest is here Tim he said gently and Endicott saw the receding
life rush back with joy into the agonized features With something like
a laugh he raised his inert hands and seized the hands of the priest
which he covered with kisses
I shall die happy thanks be to God he said weakly and father
dont forget to tell my mother Its her last consolation poor dear
And I have the holy oils Tim said Monsignor softly
Another rush of light to the darkening face
Tell her that too father dear said Tim
With my own lips answered Monsignor
The bystanders moved away a little distance and the lady resigned her
place while Tim made his last confession Endicott stood and wondered
at the sight the priest holding the boys head with his left arm close
to his bosom and Tim grasping lovingly the hand of his friend while he
whispered in little gasps his sins and his repentance briefly for time
was pressing Then Monsignor called Horace and bade him support the
lads head and also the lovely lady and gave her directions for his
mothers sake She was woman and mother both no doubt by the way she
served another womans son in his fatal distress The men brought her
water from the stream With her own hands she bared his feet bathed and
wiped them washed his hands and cried tenderly all the time Horace
shuddered as he dried the boys sweating forehead and felt the chill of
that death which had never yet come near him He saw now what the priest
meant by the holy oils Out of his satchel Monsignor took a golden
cylinder unscrewed the top dipped his thumb in what appeared to be an
oily substance and applied it to Tims eyes to his ears his nose his
mouth the palms of his hands and the soles of his feet distinctly
repeating certain Latin invocations as he worked Then he read for some
time from a little book and finished by wiping his fingers in cotton
and returning all to the satchel again There was a look of supreme
satisfaction on his face
You are all right now Tim he said cheerfully
All right father repeated the lad faintly and dont forget to tell
mother everything and say I died happy praising God and that she
wont be long after me And let Harry Cutlerthe engineer came forward
and knelt by his sidetell her everything She knew how he liked me
and a word from him was more
His voice faded away
Ill tell her murmured the engineer brokenly and slipped away in
unbearable distress The priest looked closer into Tims face
Hes going fast he said and Ill ask you all to kneel and say amen
to the last prayers for the boy
The crowd knelt by the stream in profound silence and the voice of the
priest rose like splendid music touching sad yet to Horace
unutterably pathetic and grand
Go forth O Christian soul the Monsignor read in the name of God
the Father Almighty who created thee in the name of Jesus Christ Son
of the living God who suffered for thee in the name of the Holy Ghost
who was poured forth upon thee in the name of the Angels and
Archangels in the name of the Thrones and Dominations in the name of
the Principalities and Powers in the name of the Cherubim and Seraphim
in the name of the Patriarchs and Prophets in the name of the holy
Apostles and Evangelists in the name of the holy Martyrs and
Confessors in the name of the holy Monks and Hermits in the name of
the holy Virgins and of all the Saints of God may thy place be this day
in peace and thy abode in holy Sion Through Jesus Christ our Lord
Amen
Then came a pause and the heavy sigh of the dying one shook all hearts
Endicott did not dare to look down at the mournful face of the fireman
for a terror of death had come upon him that he should be holding the
head of one condemned to the last penalty of nature at the same moment
he could not help thinking that a king might not have been more nobly
sent forth on his journey to judgment than humble Tim Hurley Monsignor
took another look at the lads face then closed his book and took off
the purple ribbon which had hung about his neck
Its over The mans dead he announced to the silent crowd There was
a general stir and a movement to get a closer look at the quiet body
lying on the grass Endicott laid the head down and rose to his feet
The woman who had ministered to the dying so sweetly tied up his chin
and covered his face murmuring with tears His poor mother
Ah there is the heart to be pitied sighed the Monsignor This heart
aches no more but the mothers will ache and not die for many a year
perhaps
Endicott heard his voice break and looking saw that the tears were
falling from his eyes he wiping them away in the same matteroffact
fashion which had marked his ministrations to the unfortunate fireman
Death is terrible only to those who love he added and the words sent
a pang into the heart of Horace It had never occurred to him that death
was loves most dreaded enemythat Sonia might die while love was
young
CHAPTER II
THE NIGHT AT THE TAVERN
The travelers of the wrecked train spent the night at the nearest
village whither all went on foot before darkness came on Monsignor
took possession of Horace also of the affections of the tavernkeeper
and of the best things which belonged to that yokel and his hostelry It
was prosperity in the midst of disaster that he and Endicott should have
a room on the first floor and find themselves comfortable in ten
minutes after their arrival By the time they had enjoyed a refreshing
meal and discussed the accident to the roots Horace Endicott felt that
his soul was at ease with the Monsignor who at no time had displayed
any other feeling than might arise from a long acquaintance with the
young man One would have pronounced the two men as they settled down
into the comfort of their room two collegians who had traveled much
together
It was an excellent thing that I brought the holy oils along
Monsignor said as if Endicott had no other interest in life than this
particular form of excellence To a polite inquiry he explained the
history nature and use of the mysterious oils
I can understand how a ceremony of that kind would soothe the last
hours of Tim Hurley said the pagan Endicott but I am curious if you
will pardon me to know if the holy oils would have a similar effect on
Monsignor ODonnell
The same old supposition chuckled the priest that there is one law
for the crowd the mob the diggers and another for the illuminati
Now let me tell you Mr Endicott that with all his faith Tim Hurley
could not have welcomed priest and oils more than I shall when I need
them The anguish of death is very bitter which you are too young to
know and it is a blessed thing to have a sovereign ready for that
anguish in the Sacrament of Extreme Unction The Holy Oils are the thing
which Macbeth desired when he demanded so bitterly of the physician
Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased
Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow
That is my conviction So if you are near when I am going to judgment
come in and see how emphatically I shall demand the holy oils even
before a priest be willing to bring them
It seems strange Horace commented very strange I cannot get at
your point of view at all
Then he went on to ask questions rapidly and Monsignor had to explain
the meaning of his title a hundred things connected with his
priesthood and to answer many objections to his explanations until the
night had worn on to bedtime and the crowd of guests began to depart
from the verandahs It was all so interesting to Horace In the priest
and his conversation he had caught a glimpse of a new world both strange
and fascinating Curious too was the profound indifference of men like
himselfcollege mento its existence It did not seem possible that
the Roman idea could grow into proportions under the bilious eyes of the
omniscient Saxon and not a soul be aware of its growth However
Monsignor was a pleasant man a true college lad an interesting talker
with music in his voice and a sincere eye He was not a
controversialist but a critic and he did not seem to mind when Horace
went off into a dream of Sonia and asked questions far from the
subject
Long afterwards Endicott recalled a peculiarity of this night which
escaped his notice at the time his sensitiveness to every detail of
their surroundings to the colors of the room to the shades of meaning
in the words of the Monsignor to his tricks of speech and tone quite
unusual in Horaces habit Sonia complained that he never could tell her
anything clear or significant of places he had seen The room which had
been secured from the landlord was the parlor of the tavern long and
low colonial in the very smell of the tapestry carpet with doors and
mantel that made one think of John Adams and General Washington The
walls had a certain terror in them a kind of suspense as when a jury
sits petrified while their foreman announces a verdict of death A long
line of portraits in oil produced this impression The faces of ancient
neighbors of the Adams the Endicotts the Bradburys severe Puritans
for whom the name of priest meant a momentary stoppage of the heart
looked coldly and precisely straight out from their frames on the
Monsignor Horace fancied that they exchanged glances What fun it would
have been to see the entire party move out from their frames and put
the wearer of the Roman purple to shameful flight
Ill bet they dont let you sleep tonight he said to the priest who
laughed at the conceit
A cricket came out on the windowsill chirped at Horaces elbow and
fled at the sound of near voices Through the thick foliage of the
chestnut trees outside he could see stars at times that made him think
of Sonias eyes The wind shook the branches gently and made little
moans and whispers in the corners as if the ghosts of the portraits
were discussing the sacrilege of the Monsignors presence Horace
thought at the time his nerves were strung tight by the incidents of the
day and his interest deeply stirred by the conversation of the priest
since hitherto he had always thought of wind as a thing that blew
disagreeably except at sea noisy insects as public nuisances to be
caught and slain and family portraits the last praiseworthy attempt of
ancestors to disturb the sleep of their remote heirs When he had
somewhat tired of asking his companion questions it occurred to him
that the Monsignor had asked none in return and might waive his right
to this privilege of goodfellowship He mentioned the matter
Thank you said Monsignor but I know all about you See now if I
give you a good account of your life and descent
He was promenading the room before the picturejury frowning on him He
looked at them a moment solemnly
Indeed I know what I would have to expect from you he said to the
portraits if you were to sit upon my case tonight Your descendant
here is more merciful
They laughed together
Well to Horace you asked me many questions because you know
nothing about me or mine although we have been on the soil this half
century The statesmen of your blood disdain me This scorn is in the
air of New England and is part of your marrow Here is an example of
it Once on a vacation I spent a few weeks in the house of a Puritan
lady who learned of my faith and blood only a week before my leaving
She had been very kind and when I bade her goodby I assured her that I
would remember her in my prayers You neednt mind she replied my
own prayers are much better than any you can say This temper explains
why you have to ask questions about me and I have none to ask
concerning you
Horace had to admit the contention
Life began for you near the river that turned the wheel of the old
sawmill Ah that river It was the beginning of history of time of
life It came from the beyond and it went over the rim of the wonderful
horizon singing and laughing like a child How often you dreamed of
following it to its end where you were certain a glory felt only in
your dreams filled the land The fishes only could do that for they
had no feet to be tired by walking Your first mystery was that wheel
which the water turned a monstrous thing a giant ugly and deadly
whose first movement sent you off in terror How could it be that the
gentle smiling yielding water which took any shape from a baby hand
had power to speed that giant The time came when you bathed in the
stream mastered it in spite of the terror which it gave you one day
when it swallowed the life of a comrade Do you remember this
Monsignor held up his hand with two fingers stretched out beyond the
others and gave a gentle warwhoop Horace laughed
I suppose every boy in the country invited his chums to a swim that
way he said
Just so The sign language was universal The old school on the village
green succeeded the river and the mill in your history Miss Primby
taught it dear old soul gentler than a mother even and you laughed at
her curls and her funny ways which hid from childs eyes a noble
heart It was she who bound up your black eye after the battle with
Bouncer the bully whose face and reputation you wrecked in the same
hour for his oppression of the most helpless boy in school That feat
made you the leader of the secret society which met at awful hours in
the deserted shanty just below the sawmill What a creep went up and
down your spine as in the chill of the evening the boys came stealing
out of the undergrowth one by one and greeted their chief with the
password known by every parent in town The stars looked down upon you
as they must have looked upon all the great conspirators of time since
the world began You felt that the life of the government hung by a
thread when such desperate characters took the risk of conspiring
against it What a day was July the Fourthwhat wretches were the
Britishwhat a hero was General Washington What land was like this
country of the West Its form on the globe was a promontory while all
others lay very low on the plane
In that spirit you went to Harvard and ran full against some great
questions of life The war was on and your father was at the front
Only your age your fathers orders and your mothers need held you
back from the fight You were your mothers son It is written all over
youand me And your father loved you doubly that you were his son and
owned her nature He fell in battle and she was slain by a crueller
foe the grief that seizing us will not let us live even for those we
love God rest the faithful dead give peace to their souls and
complete their love and their labors My father and mother are living
yetthe sweetest of blessings at my time of life You grieved as youth
grieves but life had its compensations You are a married man and you
love as your parents loved with the fire and tenderness of both Happy
man Fortunate woman
He stopped before the nearest portrait and stared at it
Well what do you think of my acquaintance with your history he
asked
Very clever Monsignor answered Horace impressed It is like
necromancy though I see how the trick is done
Precisely It is my own story It is the story of thousands of boys
whom your set will not regard as American boys unless when they are
looking for fighting material Everything and anything that could carry
a gun in the recent war was American with a vengeance The Boston
Coriolanus kissed such an one and swore that he must have come over in
the Mayflower But enoughI am not holding a brief for anybody The
description I have just given you of your life and mine is also
One momentpardon me said Horace how did you know I was married
And happy said Monsignor Well that was easy When we were talking
tonight at tea about the hanging of Howard Tims what disgust in your
tone when you cried out there should be no pity for the wretch that
kills his wife
And there should not
Of course But I knew Tims I met him for an hour and I did not feel
like hanging him
You are a celibate
Therefore unprejudiced But he was condemned by a jury of unmarried
men A clever fellow he is and yet he made some curious blunders in his
attempt to escape the other night I would like to have helped him I
have a theory of disappearing from the sight of men which would help
the desperate much This Tims was a lad of your own appearance
disposition history even I had a feeling that he ought not to die
What a pity we are too wise to yield always to our feelings
But about your theory Monsignor said Horace A theory of
disappearing
A few nights ago some friends of mine were discussing the possible
methods by which such a man as Tims might make his escape sure You know
that the influences at his command were great and tremendous efforts
were made to spare his family the disgrace of the gallows The officers
of the law were quite determined that he should not escape If he had
escaped the pursuit would have been relentless and able He would have
been caught And as I maintained simply because he would never think of
using his slight acquaintance with me You smile at that So did my
friends I have been reading up the escapes of famous criminalsit is
quite a literature I learned therein one thing that they were all
caught again because they could not give up connection with their past
with the people the scenes the habits to which they had been
accustomed So they left a little path from their hidingplace to the
past and the clever detectives always found it Thinking over this
matter I discovered that there is an art of disappearing a real art
which many have used to advantage The principle by which this art may
be formulated is simple the person disappearing must cut himself off
from his past as completely as if he had been secretly drowned in
midocean
They all seem to do that said Horace and yet they are caught as
easily as rats with traps and cheese
I see you think this art means running away to Brazil in a wig and blue
spectacles as they do in a play Let me show some of the consequences a
poor devil takes upon himself who follows the art like an artist He
must escape not only from his pursuersthats easybut from his
friendsnot so easyand chiefly from himselftheres the rub He who
flies from the relentless pursuit of the law must practically die He
must change his country never meet friend or relative again get a new
language a new trade a new place in society in fact a new past
peopled with parents and relatives a new habit of body and life a new
appearance the color of hair eyes skin must be changed and he must
eat and drink walk sleep think and speak differently He must become
another man almost as if he had changed his nature for anothers
I understand said Horace interested but the theory is impossible
No one could do that even if they desired
Tims would have desired it and accomplished it had I thought of
suggesting it to him Here is what would have happened He escapes from
the prison which is easy enough and comes straight to me We never met
but once Therefore not a man in the world would have thought of looking
for him at my house A week later he is transferred to the house of Judy
Trainor who has been expecting a sick son from California a boy who
disappeared ten years previous and is probably dead I arrange her
expectation and the neighbors are invited to rejoice with her over the
finding of her son He spends a month or two in the house recovering
from his illness and when he appears in public he knows as much about
the past of Tommy Trainor as Tommy ever knew He is welcomed by his old
friends They recognize him from his resemblance to his father old
Micky Trainor He slips into his position comfortably and in five years
the whole neighborhood would go to court and swear Tims into a lunatic
asylum if he ever tried to resume his own personality
The two men set up a shout at this sound conclusion
After all there are consequences as dark as the gallows said Horace
For instance said the priest with a wave of his hand sleeping under
the eyes of these painted ghosts
Poor Tim Hurley said Horace little he thought hed be a ghost
tonight
Hes not to be regretted replied the other except for the heart
that suffers by his absence He is with God Death is the one moment of
our career when we throw ourselves absolutely into the arms of God
The two were getting ready to slip between the sheets of the pompous
colonial bed when Horace began to laugh softly to himself He kept up
the chuckling until they were lying side by side in the darkened room
I am sure I have a share in that chuckle said Monsignor
Shades of my ancestors murmured Horace forgive this insult to your
pious memorythat I should occupy one bed with an idolatrous priest
They have got over all that In eternity there is no bigotry But what
a pity that two fine boys like us should be kept apart by that awful
spirit which prompts men to hate one another for the love of God and to
lie like slaves for the pure love of truth
I am cured said Horace placing his hand on the Monsignors arm I
shall never again overlook the human in a man Let me thank you
Monsignor for this opening of my eyes I shall never forget it This
night has been Arabian in its enchantment I dont like the idea of
tomorrow
No more do I Life is tiresome in a way For me it is an everlasting
job of beating the air with truth because others beat it with lies We
cant help but rejoice when the time comes to breathe the eternal airs
where nothing but truth can live
Horace sighed and fell asleep thinking of Sonia rather than the
delights of eternity The priest slept as soundly No protest against
this charming and manly companionship stirred the silence of the room
The ghosts of the portraits did not disturb the bold cricket of the
windowsill He chirped proudly pausing now and then to catch the
breathing of the sleepers and to interpret their unconscious movings
The trained and spiritual ear might have caught the faint sighs and
velvet footsteps of longdeparted souls or interpreted them out of the
sighing and whispering of the leaves outside the window and the tread
of nervous mice in the fireplace The dawn came and lighted up the faces
of the men faces rising out of the heavy dark like a revelation of
another world the veil of melancholy which Sleep borrows from its
brother Death resting on the head which Sonia loved and deepening the
shadows on the serious countenance of the priest They lay there like
brothers of the same womb and one might fancy the great mother Eve
stealing in between the two lights of dawn and day to kiss and bless her
justunited children
When they were parting after breakfast Monsignor said gayly
If at any time you wish to disappear command me
Thanks but I would rather you had to do the act that I might see you
carry out your theory Where do you go now
To tell Tim Hurleys mother hes dead and thus break her heart he
replied sadly and then to mend it by telling her how like a saint he
died
Add to that said Horace with a sudden rush of tears which for his
life he could not explain the comfort of a sure support from me for
the rest of her life
They clasped hands with feeling and their eyes expressed the same
