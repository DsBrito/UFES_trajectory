flowerpots in which on this occasion some asters and other autumn
flowers were growing
Within the largest sittingroom was collected a formal group awaiting
the arrival of visitors  Lord Carses sister Lady Rachel Ballino was
there surrounded by her nephews and nieces  As they came in one after
another dressed for company and made their bow or curtsey at the door
their aunt gave them permission to sit down till the arrival of the
first guest after which time it would be a matter of course that they
should stand  Miss Janet and her brothers sat down on their low stools
at some distance from each other but little Miss Flora had no notion of
submitting to their restraints at her early age and she scrambled up
the windowseat to look abroad as far as she could which was through
the high iron gates to the tall houses on the other side the Wynd
Lady Rachel saw the boys and Janet looking at each other with smiles
and this turned her attention to the child in the window who was
nodding her little curly head very energetically to somebody outside
Come down Flora said her aunt
But Flora was too busy nodding to hear that she was spoken to
Flora come down  Why are you nodding in that way
Lady nods said Flora
Lady Rachel rose deliberately from her seat and approached the window
turning pale as she went  After a single glance in the courtyard she
sank on a chair and desired her nephew Orme to ring the bell twice
Orme who saw that something was the matter rang so vigorously as to
bring the butler in immediately
John you see said the pale lips of Lady Rachel while she pointed
with a trembling finger to the courtyard
Yes my lady the doors are fastened
And Lord Carse not home yet
No my lady  I think perhaps he is somewhere near and cannot get
home
John looked irresolutely towards the child in the window  Once more
Flora was desired to come down and once more she only replied Lady
nods at me
Janet was going towards the window to enforce her aunts orders but she
was desired to keep her seat and John quickly took up Miss Flora in his
arms and set her down at her aunts knee  The child cried and
struggled said she would see the lady and must infallibly have been
dismissed to the nursery but her eye was caught and her mind presently
engaged by Lady Rachels painted fan on which there was a burning
mountain and a blue sea and a shepherdess and her lamball very gay
Flora was allowed to have the fan in her own handsa very rare favour
But presently she left off telling her aunt what she saw upon it
dropped it and clapped her hands saying as she looked at the window
Lady nods at me
It is mamma cried the elder ones starting to their feet as the lady
thrust her face through the flowers and close to the windowpane
Go to the nursery children said Lady Rachel making an effort to
rise  I will send for you presently  The elder ones appeared glad to
escape and they carried with them the struggling Flora
Lady Rachel threw up the sash crossed her arms and said in the most
formal manner What do you want Lady Carse
I want my children
You cannot have them as you well know  It is too late  I pity you
but it is too late
I will see my children  I will come home and live  I will make that
tyrant repent setting up anyone in my place at home  I have it in my
power to ruin him  I
Abstain from threats said Lady Rachel shutting the window and
fastening the sash
Lady Carse doubled her fist as if about to dash in a pane but the iron
gates behind her creaked on their hinges and she turned her head  A
chair was entering on each side of which walked a footman whose livery
Lady Carse well knew  Her handsome face red before was now more
flushed  She put her mouth close to the window and said If it had
been anybody but Lovat you would not have been rid of me this evening
I would have stood among the chairmen till midnight for the chance of
getting in  Be sure I shall tomorrow or some day  But now I am off
She darted past the chair her face turned away just as Lord Lovat was
issuing from it
Ho ho cried he in a loud and mocking tone  Ho there my Lady
Carse  A word with you  But she ran up the Wynd as fast as she could
go
You should not look so white upon it Lord Lovat observed to Lady
Rachel as soon as the door was shut  Why do you let her see her power
over you
God knows replied Lady Rachel  But it is not her threats alone that
make us nervous  It is the being incessantly subject
She cleared her throat but she could not go on
Lord Lovat swore that he would not submit to be tormented by a virago in
this way  If Lady Carse were his wife
Well what would you do asked Lady Rachel
I would get rid of her  I tell your brother so  I would get rid of
her in one way if she threatened to get rid of me in another  She may
have learned from her father how to put her enemies out of the way
Lady Rachel grew paler than ever  Lord Lovat went on
Her father carried pistols in the streets of Edinburgh and so may she
Her father was hanged for it and it is my belief that she would have no
objection to that end if she could have her revenge first  Ay you
wonder why I say such things to you frightened as you are already  I
do it that you may not infuse any weakness into your brothers purposes
if he should think fit to rid the town of her one of these days  Come
come  I did not say rid the world of her
Merciful Heaven no
There are places you know where troublesome people have no means of
doing mischief  I could point out such a place presently if I were
askeda place where she might be as safe as under lock and key without
the trouble and risk of confining her and having to consider the law
You do not mean a prison then
No  She has not yet done anything to make it easy to put her in prison
for life and anything short of that would be more risk than comfort
If Carse gives me authority I will dispose of her where she can be free
to rove like the wild goats  If she should take a fancy to jump down a
precipice or drown herself that is her own affair you know
The door opened for the entrance of company  Lord Lovat whispered once
more Only this  If Carse thinks of giving the case into my hands
dont you oppose it  I will not touch her life I swear to you
Lady Rachel knew like the rest of the world that Lord Lovats swearing
went for no more than any of his other engagements  Though she would
have given all she had in the world to be freed from the terror of Lady
Carse and to hope that the children might forget their unhappy mother
she shrank from the idea of putting any person into the hands of the
hard and mocking and plotting Lord Lovat  As for the legality of
doing anything at all to Lady Carse while she did not herself break the
law that was a consideration which no more occurred to Lady Rachel than
to the violent Lord Lovat himself
Lady Rachel was exerting herself to entertain her guests and had sent
for the children when to her inexplicable relief the butler brought
her the news that Lord Carse and his son Willie were home and would
appear with all speed  They had been detained two hours in a tavern
John said
In a tavern
Yes my lady  Could not get out  Did not wish to collect more people
to cause a mob  It is all right now my lady
When Lord Carse entered he made formal apologies to his guests first
and his sister afterwards for his late appearance  He had been delayed
by an affair of importance on his way home  His rigid countenance was
somewhat paler than usual and his manner more dictatorial  His hard
and unwavering voice was heard all the evening prosing and explaining
The only tokens of feeling were when he spoke to his eldest son Willie
who was spiritless and as the close observer saw tearful and when he
took little Flora in his arms and stroked her shining hair and asked
her if she had been walking with the nurse
Flora did not answer  She was anxiously watching Lady Rachels
countenance  Her papa bade her look at him and answer his question
She did so after glancing at her aunt and saying eagerly in a loud
whisper I am not going to say anything about the lady that came to the
window and nodded at me
It did not mend the matter that her sister and brothers all said at
once in a loud whisper Hush  Flora
Her father sat her down hastily  Lord Carses domestic troubles were
pretty wellknown throughout Edinburgh and the company settled it in
their own minds that there had been a scene this afternoon
When they were gone Lord Carse gave his sister his advice not to
instruct any very young child in any part to be acted  He assured her
that very young children have not the discretion of grown people and
gave it as his opinion that when the simplicity which is extremely
agreeable by the domestic fireside becomes troublesome or dangerous in
society the child is better disposed of in the nursery
Lady Rachel meekly submitted only observing what a singular and painful
case was that of these children who had to be so early trained to avoid
the very mention of their mother  She believed her brother to be the
most religious man she had ever known yet she now heard him mutter
oaths so terrible that they made her blood run cold
Brother my dear brother she expostulated
Ill tell you what she has done he said from behind his set teeth
She has taken a lodging in this very Wynd directly opposite my gates
Not a child not a servant not a dog or cat can leave my house without
coming under her eye  She will be speaking to the children out of her
window
She will be nodding at Flora from the courtyard as often as you are
out cried Lady Rachel  And if she should shoot you from her window
brother
She hints that she will and there are many things more unlikely
considering as she herself says whose daughter she isBut no he
continued seeing the dreadful alarm into which his sister was thrown
This will not be her method of revenge  There is another that pleases
her better because she suspects that I dread it moreYou know what I
mean
Political secrets  Lady Rachel whisperednot in Floras kind of
whisper but quite into her brothers ear
He nodded assent and then he gravely informed her that his
acquaintance Duncan Forbes had sent a particular request to see him in
the morning  He should go he said  It would not do to refuse waiting
on the President of the Court of Session as he was known to be in
Edinburgh  But he wished he was a hundred miles off if he was to hear
a Hanoverian lecture from a man so good natured and so dignified by his
office that he must always have his own way
Lady Rachel went to bed very miserable this night  She wished that Lady
Carse and King George and all the House of Brunswick had never existed
or that Prince Charlie or some of the exiled royal family would come
over at once and take possession of the kingdom that her brother and
his friends might no longer be compelled to live in a state of suspicion
and dreadevery day planning to bring in a new king and every day
obliged to appear satisfied with the one they had their secret or some
part of it being all the while at the mercy of a violent woman who
hated them all
CHAPTER TWO
THE TURBULENT
When Lord Carse issued from his own house the next morning to visit the
President he had his daughter Janet by his side and John behind him
He took Janet in the hope that her presence while it would be no
impediment to any properly legal business would secure him from any
political conversation being introduced and there was no need of any
apology for her visit as the President usually asked why he had not the
pleasure of seeing her if her father went alone  Duncan Forbess good
nature to all young people was known to everybody but he declared
himself an admirer of Janet above all others and Janet never felt
herself of so much consequence as in the Presidents house
John went as an escort to his young lady on her return
Janet felt her fathers arm twitch as they issued from their gates and
looking up to see why she saw that his face was twitching too  She did
not know how near her mother was nor that her father and John had their
ears on the stretch for a hail from the voice they dreaded above all
others in the world  But nothing was seen or heard of Lady Carse and
when they turned out of the Wynd Lord Carse resumed his usual air and
step of formal importance and Janet held up her head and tried to take
steps as long as his
All was right about her going to the Presidents  He kissed her
forehead and praised her father for bringing her and picked out for
her the prettiest flowers from a bouquet before he sat down to business
and then he rose again and provided her with a portfolio of prints to
amuse herself with and even then he did not forget her but glanced
aside several times to explain the subject of some print or to draw
her attention to some beauty in the one she was looking at
My dear lord said he I have taken a liberty with your time but I
want your opinion on a scheme I have drawn out at length for Government
for preventing and punishing the use of tea among the common people
Very good very good observed Lord Carse greatly relieved about the
reasons for his being sent for  It is high time if our agriculture is
to be preserved that the use of malt should be promoted to the utmost
by those in power
I am sure of it said the President  Things have got to such a pass
that in towns the meanest people have tea at the mornings meal to the
discontinuance of the ale which ought to be their diet and poor women
dank this drug also in the afternoons to the exclusion of the
twopenny
It is very bad very unpatriotic very immoral declared Lord Carse
Such people must be dealt with outright
The President put on his spectacles and opened his papers to explain
his planthat plan which it now appears almost incredible should have
come from a man so wise so liberal so kindhearted as Duncan Forbes
He showed how he would draw the line between those who ought and those
who ought not to be permitted to drink tea how each was to be
described and how when anyone was suspected of taking tea when he
ought to be drinking beer he was to tell on oath what his income was
that it might be judged whether he could pay the extremely high duty on
tea which the plan would impose  Houses might be visited and cupboards
and cellars searched at all hours in cases of suspicion
These provisions are pretty severe the President himself observed
But
But not more than is necessary declared Lord Carse  I should say
they are too mild  If our agriculture is not supported if the malt tax
falls off what is to become of us
And he sighed deeply
If we find this scheme work well as far as it goes observed the
President cheerfully we can easily render it as much more stringent
as occasion may require  And now what can Miss Janet tell us on this
subject  Can she give information of any tea being drunk in the nursery
at home
Oh to be sure said Janet  Nurse often lets me have some with her
and Katie fills Floras dolls teapot out of her own almost every
afternoon
Bless my soul cried Lord Carse starting from his seat in
consternation  My servants drink tea in my house  Off they shall go
every one of them who does it
Oh papa  No pray papa implored Janet  They will say I sent them
away  Oh  I wish nobody had asked me anything about it
It was my doing said the President  My dear lord I make it my
request that your servants may be forgiven
Lord Carse bowed his acquiescence but he shook his head and looked
very gloomy about such a thing happening in his house  The President
agreed with him that it must not happen again on pain of instant
dismissal
The President next invited Janet to the drawingroom to see a grey
parrot brought hither since her last visita very entertaining
companion in the evenings the President declared  He told Lord Carse
he would be back in three minutes and so he waswith a lady on his
arm and that lady wasLady Carse
She was not flushed now nor angry nor forward  She was quiet and
ladylike while in the house of one of the most gentlemanly men of his
time  If her husband had looked at her he would have seen her so much
like the woman he wooed and once dearly loved that he might have
somewhat changed his feelings towards her  But he went abruptly to the
window when he discovered who she was and nothing could make him turn
his head  Perhaps he was aware how pale he was and desired that she
should not see it
The President placed the lady in a chair and then approached Lord
Carse and laid his hand on his shoulder saying You will forgive me
when you know my reasons  I want you to join me in prevailing on this
good lady to give up a design which I think imprudentI will say
wrong
It was surprising but Lady Carse for once bore quietly with somebody
thinking her wrong  Whatever she might feel she said nothing  The
President went on
Lady Carse
He felt as his hand lay on his friends shoulder that he winced as if
the very name stung him
Lady Carse continued the President cannot be deterred by any
account that can be given her of the perils and hardships of a journey
to London  She declares her intention of going
I am no baby I am no coward declared the lady  The coach would not
have been set up and it would not continue to go once a fortnight if
the journey were not practicable and where others go I can go
Of the dangers of the road I tell this good lady resumed the
President she can judge as well as you or I my lord  But of the
perils of the rest of her errand she must I think admit that we may be
better judges
How can you let your Hanoverian prejudices seduce you into
countenancing such a devil as that woman and believing a word that she
says muttered Lord Carse in a hoarse voice
Why my good friend replied the President it does so vex my very
heart every day to see how the ladies whom I would fain honour for
their discretion as much as I admire them for their other virtues are
wild on behalf of the Pretender or eager for a desperate and
treasonable war that you must not wonder if I take pleasure in meeting
with one who is loyal to her rightful sovereign  Loyal I must suppose
at home and in a quiet way for she knows that I do not approve of her
journey to London to see the minister
The minister faltered out Lord Carse
He heard or fancied he heard his wife laughing behind him
Come now my friends said the President with a goodhumoured
seriousness let me tell you that the position of either of you is no
joke  It is too serious for any lightness and for any passion  I do
not want to hear a word about your grievances  I see quite enough  I
see a lady driven from home deprived of her children and tormenting
herself with thoughts of revenge because she has no other object  I see
a gentleman who has been cruelly put to shame in his own house and in
the public street worn with anxiety about his innocent daughters and
with natural fearsinevitable fears of the mischief that may be done
to his character and fortunes by an ill use of the confidence he once
gave to the wife of his bosom
There was a suppressed groan from Lord Carse and something like a
titter from the lady  The President went on even more gravely
I know how easy it is for people to make each other wretched and
especially for you two to ruin each other  If I could but persuade you
to sit down with me to a quiet discussion of a plan for living together
or apart abstaining from mutual injury
Lord Carse dissented audibly from their living together and the lady
from living apart
Why remonstrated the President things cannot be worse than they are
now  You make life a hell
I am sure it is to me sighed Lord Carse
It is not yet so to me said the lady  I
It is not thundered her husband turning suddenly round upon her
Then I will take care it shall be
For Gods sake hush exclaimed the President shocked to the soul
Do your worst said the lady rising  We will try which has the most
power  You know what ruin is
Stop a moment said the President  I dont exactly like to have this
quiet house of mine made a hell of  I cannot have you part on these
terms
But the lady had curtseyed and was gone  For a minute or two nothing
was said  Then a sort of scream was heard from upstairs
My Janet cried Lord Carse
I will go and see said the President  Janet is my especial pet you
know
He immediately returned smiling and said There is nothing amiss with
Janet  Come and see
Janet was on her mothers lap her arms thrown round her neck while the
mothers tears streamed over them both  Can you resist this the
President asked of Lord Carse  Can you keep them apart after this
I can he replied  I will not permit her the devilish pleasure she
wantsof making my own children my enemies
He was going to take Janet by force but the President interfered and
said authoritatively to Lady Carse that she had better go her time was
not yet come  She must wait and his advice was to wait patiently and
harmlessly
It could not have been believed how instantaneously a woman in such
emotion could recover herself
She put Janet off her knee  In an instant there were no more traces of
tears and her face was composed and her manner hard
Goodbye my dear she said to the weeping Janet  Dont cry so my
dear  Keep your tears for you will have something more to cry for
soon  I am going home to pack my trunk for London  Have my friends any
commands for London
And she looked round steadily upon the three faces
The President was extremely grave when their eyes met but even his eye
sank under hers  He offered his arm to conduct her downstairs and took
leave of her at the gate with a silent bow
He met Lord Carse and Janet coming downstairs and begged them to stay
awhile dreading perhaps a street encounter  But Lord Carse was bent
on being gone immediatelyand had not another moment to spare
CHAPTER THREE
THE WRONG JOURNEY
Lady Carse and her maid Bessiean elderly woman who had served her from
her youth up bearing with her temper for the sake of that family
attachment which exists so strongly in Scotlandwere busy packing
trunks this afternoon when they were told that a gentleman must speak
with Lady Carse below stairs
There will be no peace till we are off observed the lady to her maid
In answer to which Bessie only sighed deeply
I want you to attend me downstairs observed the lady  But this
provoking nonsense of yours this crying about going a journey has made
you not fit to be seen  If any friend of my lords saw your red eyes
he would go and say that my own maid was on my lords side  I must go
down alone
Pray madam let me attend you  The gentleman will not think of
looking at me and I will stand with my back to the light and the room
is dark
No your very voice is full of tears  Stay where you are
Lady Carse sailed into the room very grandly not knowing whom she was
to see  Nor was she any wiser when she did see him  He was muffled up
and wore a shawl tied over his mouth and kept his hat on so that
little space was left between hat periwig and comforter  He
apologised for wearing his hat and for keeping the lady standinghis
business was shortin the first place to show her Lord Carses ring
which she would immediately recognise
She glanced at the ring and knew it at once
On the warrant of this ring continued the gentleman I come from
your husband to require from you what you cannot refuseeither as a
wife or consistent with your safety  You hold a documenta letter
from your husband written to you in conjugal confidence five years ago
from Londona letter
You need not describe it further said the lady  It is my chief
treasure and not likely to escape my recollection  It is a letter from
Lord Carse containing treasonable expressions relating to the royal
family
About the treason we might differ madam but my business is not to
argue that but to require of you to deliver up that paper to me on
this warrant again producing the ring
The lady laughed and asked whether the gentleman was a fool or took her
to be one that he asked her to give up what she had just told him was
the greatest treasure she had in the worldher sure means of revenge
upon her enemies
You will not asked the gentleman
I will not
Then hear what you have to expect madam  Hear it and then take time
to consider once more
I have no time to spare she replied  I start for London early in
the morning and my preparations are not complete
You must hear me however said the gentleman  If you do not yield
your husband will immediately and irrevocably put you to open shame
He cannot she replied  I have no shame  I have the advantage of
him there
You have however personal liberty at present  You have that to
loseand life madam  You have that to lose
Lady Carse caught at the table and leaned on it to support herself  It
was not from fear about her liberty or life but because there was a
cruel tone in the utterance of the last words which told her that it
was Lord Lovat who was threatening her and she was afraid of him
I have shaken you now said he  Come give me the letter
It is not fear that shakes me she replied  It is disgust  The
disgust that some feel at reptiles I feel at you my Lord Lovat
She quickly turned and left the room  When he followed she had her foot
on the stairs  He said aloud You will repent madam  You will
repent
That is my own affair
True madam most true  I charge you to remember that you have
yourself said that it is your own affair if you find you have cause to
repent
Lady Carse stood on the stairs till her visitor had closed the house
door behind him struggled up to her chamber and fainted on the
threshold
This journey will never do madam said Bessie as her mistress
revived
It is the very thing for me protested the lady  In twelve hours
more we shall have left this town and my enemies behind us and then I
shall be happy
Bessie sighed  Her mistress often talked of being happy but nobody had
ever yet seen her so
This fainting is nothing said Lady Carse rising from the bed  It
is only that my soul sickens when Lord Lovat comes near and the visitor
below was Lord Lovat
Mercy on us exclaimed Bessie  What next
Why that we must get this lock turned said her lady kneeling on the
lid of a trunk  Now try again  There it is  Give me the key  Get
me a cup of tea and then to bed with you  I have a letter to write
Call me at four to a minute  Have you ordered two chairs to save all
risk
Yes madam and the landlord will see your things to the coach office
tonight
Lady Carse had sealed her letter and was winding up her watch with her
eyes fixed on the decaying fire when she was startled by a knock at the
house door  Everybody else was in bed  In a vague fear she hastened to
her chamber and held the door in her hand and listened while the
landlord went down  There were two voices besides his and there was a
noise as of something heavy brought into the hall  When this was done
and the bolts and bars were again fastened she went to the stairhead
and saw the landlord coming up with a letter in his hand  The letter
was for her  It was heavy  Her trunks had come back from the coach
office  The London coach was gone
The letter contained the money paid for the fare of Lady Carse and her
maid to London and explained that a person of importance having
occasion to go to London with attendants and it being necessary to use
haste the coach was compelled to start six hours earlier than usual
and Lady Carse would have the first choice of places next timethat is
in a fortnight
Bessie had never seen her mistress in such a rage as now and poor
Bessie was never to see it again  At the first news she was off her
guard and thanked Heaven that this dangerous journey was put off for a
fortnight and much might happen in that time  Her mistress turned
round upon her said it was not put offshe would go on horseback
aloneshe would go on footshe would crawl on her knees sooner than
give up  Bessie was silent well knowing that none of these ways would
or could be tried and thankful that there was only this one coach to
England  Enraged at her silence her mistress declared that no one who
was afraid to go to London was a proper servant for her and turned her
off upon the spot  She paid her wages to the weeping Bessie and with
the first light of morning sent her from the house herself closing the
door behind her  She then went to bed drawing the curtains close round
it remaining there all the next day and refusing food
In the evening she wearily rose and slowly dressed herselffor the
first time in her life without help  She was fretted and humbled at the
little difficulties of her toilet and secretly wished many times that
Bessie would come back and offer her services though she was resolved
to appear not to accept them without a very humble apology from Bessie
for her fears about London  At last she was ready to go down to tea
dressed in a wrappinggown and slippers  When halfway down she heard a
step behind her and looked round  A Highlander was just two stairs
