their affairs and as any child would bitterly resented it
Why dont you go downstairs Jane she said at last when she could
endure it no longer you know mother doesnt allow gossiping in the
nursery
But she had only a shaking from nurse and a rude answer from Jane which
made her anger burn hotter than ever  She lay awake a long time that
night trying to make sense of what they had been saying but it was not
until years later that she really understood
The next day Jane had had a months notice given her not because she
gossiped in the nursery or was rude to EstherEsther never told tales
about the servantsbut because Mr Carroll said briefly that they must
manage with fewer servants and cut down all expenses  For that same
reason the childrens pony was taken away and sold a few days later
and from that time it seemed to Esther it had been nothing but cutting
down and giving up and doing with less and less  It was only a few
months after the pony was sold that Poppy was born and soon after that
they left their old home and went to live in a little house where they had
no library and no nursery and no stables or horses and the children had
to play in the diningroom and Esthers chief recollection of this time
was her constant struggle to prevent Penelope and Angela and the new baby
from crying or making too much noise for she knew by the frown on her
fathers face that he was worried and bothered by it and she could not
bear to see him looking gloomy or to hear the children scolded
Having no nursery they had no nurseno real nurse they had a
cookgeneral and a nursehousemaid as the advertisements put it and
in common with most persons who profess to be able to turn their hands to
anything they could do few things and nothing well  So it fell to
Esther and her mother to take care of the babies and as Mrs Carroll had
not yet learnt to take care of herself even a very heavy burden rested on
little seriousfaced Esther
It was better when the summer came though for then the family made
another move  True it was to a yet smaller house and more things had to
be given up but the smaller house was in a little village called Framley
and the little village had woods lying behind it and here was nursery
large enough for any number of children to laugh in or cry to their
hearts content without disturbing any one and Esthers heart was
relieved of one big worry and the children soon learnt to laugh a again
and play and make as much noise as their hearts desired
Summer though cannot last for ever and woods do not make an ideal
nursery in winter  The perplexed frown was beginning to pucker Esthers
brow again when once more they were called on to relinquish something
The nursehousemaid had to be sent away and they had to learn how to
manage with one servant and it was just about that time that she heard
her father say one day It will really be easier for you dear when I am
gone at which her mother burst into tears and wailed something Esther
could not quite understand about being left to bear all the worries
alone  It is much worse for those who are left than for those who go
she cried
But you will have the children Mr Carroll said sadly
Yes four of them to feed and bring up on two hundred a year and only
one servant to help me  I dont know how any one can expect me to do it
Ive not had a new gown myself for nearly a year
It shall not be for long dear if I can help it her husband had said
very patiently  As soon as possible I will send for you and the
children  But it is no use to take you all out until I have a home of
some sort ready for you it would be greater misery than this
But Mrs Carroll had only wept more and more until the children began to
weep too though they did not know for what
Soon after that there had been a great deal of upset and excitement in the
house  big boxes stood about on the landing and the children were told
that daddy was packinghe was going away to Canada where they were all
to join him soon  For a few days this news filled them with a pleasant
excitement and for months after their father had gone Esther and Penelope
talked and talked of what they would do when they got to Canada and
Penelope dragged out an old trunk and began to pack a curious assortment
of things that she thought peculiarly suitable for that country
But as time went on she found she needed the things and by degrees the
thought of Canada became dim and of no immediate interest to them
They were excited at first when their fathers letters came because they
thought each one would bring the longedfor summons then they grew almost
to dread them for their mother always broke out into tears and wailings
on reading them finally locking herself in her room for the rest of the
day and the children were left to themselves to try to throw off the load
of oppression and wretchedness which weighed on them even while they
played  The memory of the wretchedness of those days remained with them
to the end of their lives
Two three four years passed by and gradually they forgot Canada and
Mrs Carroll ceased to weep on receipt of a letter from her husband but
whether it was that she grew more used to her trouble or that the news
was better the children did not know though Esther often longed to
So things were on that sunny May day when Penelope lay dreaming and
watching the butterflies in the neglected garden and Esther made a milk
pudding in the kitchen and the two younger children played about the
house while nearer and nearer came the postman bearing the letter that
was to alter all their lives for them
Esther had just finished making her pudding and Poppy had that moment
succeeded in inveigling Angela into the cupboard under the stairs and
turning the key on her when footsteps came up the path a letter dropped
in through the letterbox and a postmans rattat sounded to the
furthermost corner of the little house
The post was the principal excitement of the day to the little Carrolls
and there was usually a race to the door to try to be first to seize the
letters  This time Poppy had a clear start for Esther was in the
kitchen and Angela was safely under lock and key
A letter from daddy she shouted recognising the stamp and in she flew
with it to her mother
Mrs Carroll roused from her reading laid aside her novel and bottle of
smellingsalts to take the letter  Having secured and handed over the
prize Poppy danced off again  She was far more interested at that
moment in her prisoner whose kicks on the door and screams of rage had
brought Esther to her rescue
Esther having released one sister strolled wearily out into the garden
to seek another and a little rest  She was very tired and very depressed
but the garden did not look inviting when she got there
How can you like this untidy old place she cried as she made her way
through the long rank grass
Oh Esther come gently do  Look oh do look at that lovely dragonfly
Did you ever see such a beauty  Dont disturb him  Oh do be careful
But Esther looked with only halfinterest at the gorgeous insect then
turning away a little impatiently I dont know how you can be out here
so much and not try to make it a little tidier she said vexedly
I only wish I had a machine or shears or something and more time and I
would do something to it
Esther was by nature a very neat and dainty little person with none of
Penelopes dreamy indifference to her surroundings  The untidy garden
with its air of neglect would have been irritating to her if it had
belonged to some one else but being their own and feeling responsible
for it it vexed her so she could hardly endure to stay in it
If the others could have had their way they would have had all their
meals out there but not so Esther the sight of the poor neglected spot
would have quite destroyed her appetite though no one loved having meals
outofdoors better than she did  She often took the children to tea in
the woods but that was different the woods were always lovely and
just what they should be
Esthers earlier years had given her a brief experience of how things
should be done and how they should look and she had never forgotten
Penelope on the other hand had forgotten or never noticed Angela and
Poppy fired by Esthers example had spasmodic passions for improving the
house or garden during which every one suffered more or less and they
themselves were exhausted long before the huge tasks they had undertaken
were half completed
So here and there the garden showed cleared and scarred patches where the
children had worked which meant that they had begun to tidy by
pulling up everything that grew after which they would scrape the bed
over with a rake and replace in a prim row as many of the plants as they
could get in and a day or two later the eye would be caught by a square
of brown earth broken by a row of sorrylooking dead or dying plants
standing conspicuous and solitary against the wild untrained vegetation
round about while a later search would perhaps reveal under the tangled
litter in the path one of the best dinnerknives covered with rust and
other lost treasures such as a trowel scissors and occasionally a
silver fork
To Esther these attempts were merely depressing and irritating they
seemed only to emphasise their helplessness and the uselessness of trying
to make things better
Nothing is right here somehow she complained to Penelope now
neither the house nor the garden nor ourselves  Look at us throwing
out her hands dramatically  We arent educated or dressed properly
oror anything  Look at that stretching out her foot and eyeing
disdainfully the clumsy shoe which disfigured it  We arent fit to go
anywhere and we cant ask any one here because the house is never fit to
be seen or the meals or
Never mind said Penelope placidly  She was used to Esthers outbursts
but though quite unable to sympathise she was ready with attempts at
comfort  You dont want to know any one but ourselves do you
I dont
Noo admitted Esther  But we ought to  Itwell it is always
supposed to be right  We shall grow up like savages Aunt Julia says and
not be fit to talk to any one or go anywhere and we shant have any
friends and every one ought to make nice friends it looks so bad if
one has none
Miss Esther  Miss Esther called a sharp voice from the kitchen door
You must all come in at once  Your ma wants you immejutlyall of you
Esther rose a little anxious pucker gathering on her brow as she
remembered the Canadian letter
Come along Pen she said impatiently  I wonder what it is  Bad news
from father I expect
Praps its good news said Penelope hopefully rising with a sigh of
regret at having to leave her nest and the sunshine and the butterflies
Somehow though she did not really expect any such thing  Praps we
are to go at last  Oh with sudden excitement wouldnt it be
perfectly lovely  Oh Essie wouldnt it be splendid  Do lets run in
and see if that is what it is mother wants us for
CHAPTER II
Children do make haste  How long you do take coming when I send for
you  And Ive had such news I am really quite bewildered and havent a
moment to spare  All my plans are changed in a minute and I can hardly
realise all I have to do  I have heard from your father  He wants me to
come out to him and I am going at once of course I must go
I couldnt refuse to andyou must all go to live with your Aunt Julia
I know you dont like herand it is very naughty and ungrateful of you
but I cant do anything else and you must make up your minds to behave
Mrs Carroll paused at last from want of breath and the children gasped
in sympathy
They had barely entered the diningroom when this cataract of speech was
turned on them by their mother with every appearance of excitement and
gratification  All her usual melancholy apathy was thrown aside her face
was alight with pleasure her eyes bright with excitement  Mrs Carroll
loved to be the bearer of startling news to spring a surprise on people
just as she loved to have a pleasant one sprung on herself  She adored
excitement and under its influence saw nothing but the one thing that
appealed to her at the moment
Now after hastily scanning her husbands letter she grasped the one fact
that he thought she might come out to him very soon  What the change
might mean to others never occurred to her that it might be for the
worse never entered her head  She saw simply a chance of a change an
escape from the monotony and sordidness of her present life  She would
have a new outfit and travel and meet new people and escape from that
dreadful little cheap house and dull village not to speak of other
tiresome things which had been thrusting themselves on her attention for a
long time but had been put aside and aside for consideration some day
The children stood just within the door startled and bewilderedtoo
bewildered for the moment to move or speak  Going away they gasped at
last andand we are to be left behind  Oh mother you cant mean
it
They loved their careless easygoing mother very dearly and in spite of
her neglect of them were as a rule very happy  She was the one person
in the world too that they knew well and were accustomed to and to be
thus suddenly bereft of her and left entirely to strangers or worse was
a prospect too appalling almost to be credited  In spite of her neglect
they loved her in fact it was only as they grew older that they realised
that she did neglect them or was not to them all she might have been
Esther was beginning to realise it but Esther in spite of her odd sharp
temper and reserved manner had a great love for her mother she loved her
so much that she wanted her to be different to be more what the ideal
mother wassuch a one as she had read of in books
Oh mother you arent really going away and going to leave us cried
Angela again  Mother you cant  We cant be left  At the thought of
it Poppy began to cry
Yes your father wants me to come and I must go as soon as I can make
arrangements  Of course I cant take you all with me so I am going to
ask your Aunt Julia to let you go and live with her
What Esther had been on the point of saying was never saidher mothers
apparent indifference to their separation hurt her too deeply
Oh then Aunt Julia does not know it yet she remarked shrewdly
No your father has left all the arrangements to me to make and I am to
come as soon as I like so as I see no use in delaying I shall try to
get away as soon as I possibly can
Mrs Carrolls brain could work very quickly under certain circumstances
Now though only a few moments had elapsed since the momentous letter had
arrived she had formed plans innumerable to be carried out at once in
spite of all obstacles  She would give Lydia a months notice this very
day and the landlord notice that she was going to leave the house and
her sister Julia that she was about to send the four children to take up
their abode with her at onceshe would feel so much freer when they were
settled and she was alone
But perhaps Aunt Julia will not have us said Penelope joyfully
clutching at the hope  They none of them loved their Aunt Julia
Not to be going to Canada was bad enough but to have to go and live with
Aunt Julia for no one knew how long was too dreadful to contemplate
Oh mother dont send us to her do take us with you mother dear
pleaded Angela tearfully  Doesnt father say we are to come  I am sure
he wants us too
Dont bother me now child said Mrs Carroll not crossly but with a
distracted air pushing aside Angelas clinging eager arms
Ive got more than enough to think of as it is  Of course you cant go
now
Why mother  Cant we afford it asked straightforward Penelope
Oh do be quiet  Dont bother any more cried Esther bitterly
Dont you see that mother doesnt want us and Aunt Julia wont want us
nobody wants us  And in a tumult of pain and anger she flung herself out
of the room to hide the tears that made her eyes smart and tingle
I really think your Aunt Julia would refuse to have Esther if she knew
how bad her temper has become said Mrs Carroll with a sigh
She seems quite to have forgotten the respect due to her mother and to
think I may be spoken to in any way she chooses  I am sure no other
mother would endure such behaviour from their children as I have to
Esther didnt mean to be rude mother pleaded Penelope  I expect she
is upset cause daddy didnt send for us too  He said he would you
know and we always thought we should go too when you went  It is an
awful disappointment sadly
Mother pleaded Angela wistfully it isnt true what Esther said is
it  You do want us dont you
I certainly do not want children with me who dont know how to behave
said Mrs Carroll in a quick reproving tone never dreaming of the love
and longing in the childs heart  A few words of explanation of love
and sorrow for the parting of hope of a speedy reuniting would have
relieved all their young hearts of a load would have banished that
chilling feeling of being unloved unwanted would have filled them with
hope and patience and have bound their young hearts to their absent
parents for ever  Instead of which they felt rebuffed and unloved they
were turned in on themselves until such time as some other love should
warm their chilled hearts and expand their natures and a stranger maybe
should mean more to them than a parent
Of all the little brood Angela was the most affectionate the most
clinging little homebird  She loved her mother passionately and her
home too in spite of its unattractiveness for the flaws she saw in
persons or things only made her love with a deeper more sympathetic
desire to help  It was always to the most unlovable and unattractive that
Angelas heart went out  If people or animals had no one else to care for
them she felt they might be glad of her
She turned away from her mother with a little sigh  She did not blame her
for her want of feeling she only winced as at a new revelation of her own
unlovableness
Poppy who all this while had been standing mute and considering was at
that moment struck by an inspiriting idea
But mother she said gravely if we dont know how to behave properly
Aunt Julia wont want us either and then what shall we do  You will
have to take us with you with rising hope in her voice and I am
sure daddy would be glad and I do want to go in the big ship and see
daddy with a deep sigh  Oh I do pathetically want to see daddy
so badly
Dont talk nonsense child  You cant remember your father  Why should
you want to see him
I do  I want to see what he is like  Esther remembers him and she
wants to see him too  Do take us with you mother  Well beoh ever
so good  I dont like Aunt Julia she is always cross and I dont
like cross people
Poppy had no fear or awe of any one  Every one but Aunt Julia had loved
her always and done their best to make her happy even cross Lydia and
she in return rewarded them by a placid sweet acceptance of their
efforts and allowing them to love her
Mother burst out Penelope eagerly couldnt we all go to
boardingschool while you are away  It would be jolly and ever so much
nicer than living with Aunt Julia  I know we shall always be getting into
scrapes if we go to her and no one could please her Lydia said so
Nonsense said Mrs Carroll warmly Lydia is a very rude girl to speak
so of a lady and my sister and if I were remaining here I should not
allow you all to go into the kitchen so much  It will be very good for
you to try to please your aunt  Children dont know what is best for
them andand they should learn to consider others before themselves
A grownup observer might have smiled satirically at Mrs Carrolls
theories so easily preached so neglected in practice
Now run away  I have so much to think of my poor head is quite
bewildered  I think I must have a cup of tea at oncewill you tell
Esther or Lydia to make it for meor I shall have a dreadful headache
and I must think out what outfit I shall require or it will never be
ready in time and I must try to let the house or we shall have to pay
another quarters rent and there is the furniture to get rid of andoh
dear oh dear my poor head feels quite bewildered already however
shall I manage it all and by myself too  It is really too much to face
alonenow children dont make a noise or you will drive me distracted
Without another word the three walked away in search of Esther and to
talk over the dreadful and bewildering change the last hour had wrought in
their outlook but Esther sitting whitefaced and angryeyed on her bed
could not be brought to discuss anything  She was bitterly disappointed
not to be going to Canada furiously angry at having to go to Aunt Julia
who treated them all invariably as though they were naughty or going to be
naughty cruelly hurt that her mother showed so little feeling at being
parted from them all and curiously full of pain at the thought of
parting from that mother
Poor Esther could not see of course that this same parting was really
for her good that there under the strain and discord of her home she was
allowing herself to become irritable and captious despondent and
sharptongued  She knew she always felt cross and injured and sore
but she never set herself to face the reason and combat it
Two days later a reply came from Miss Julia Foster and a frown sat
heavily on Mrs Carrolls brow  Aunt Julia firmly refused to take over at
a moments notice the burden her sister was so calmly laying on her
shoulders
People who have children must expect to give up something for them she
wrote  You really must not expect to throw off your responsibilities in
this way  It is your duty to stay with them if you cannot take them with
you  I observe you say nothing as to the provision you are prepared to
make for their board and clothing and education  I presume you dont
expect me to take over the responsibility of providing all that too
Miss Foster wrote as she talked very candidly
Mrs Carrolls face flushed with anger and annoyance
Julia never would do anything to oblige any one she said sharply
She has always been the same  I only wonder I thought of asking her
It never occurred to her to think what it would mean to a person
unaccustomed to children to have four suddenly introduced into a quiet
home hitherto occupied only by one very prim and particular lady and two
equally prim servants who did not know what real work was
Miss Fosters first thought had been Neither of the maids would stay
and she could not contemplate the terrors of changing  Her second
thought Who is to provide for the children  She felt quite certain
that that important point had never entered into their mothers
calculations and she felt distinctly annoyed with her sister for the
abrupt and casual way in which she threw such a great responsibility on
others shoulders and in her letter she made her feelings plain
For a few moments Mrs Carroll sat considering  One by one all her
relations and friends were passed in review before her minds eye
There seems she said at last in a musing tone no one but Cousin
Charlotte  I wonder
There was not much doubt as to what Mrs Carroll was wondering  Her face
lightened determination shone in her eye
Cousin Charlotte or Miss Charlotte Ashe was a cousin of Mrs Carrolls
mother  In her earlier years she had kept a girls school in London but
when she found herself growing old she sold it and retired to a little
house in her native village in Devonshire  Schoolmistresses do not as a
rule grow rich and Miss Ashe was the last person to save money for
herself while there was any one else wanting it she managed however to
save enough to keep herself and Anna her former cook in their little
house in comfort and put a trifle by for an emergency
It was to this quiet modest little home that Mrs Carrolls thoughts now
flew without the slightest feeling of compunction at invading it as she
meant it to be invaded  Her letter to Miss Ashe was a masterpiece of
pathetic pleading  Miss Charlotte read it with tears of pity for the poor
mother reduced from affluence and luxury to poverty and the position of
an emigrants wife torn from her children by stress of circumstance
Then she read it again to Anna and Annas eyes filled too but it was for
the children that Anna wept  Both kind hearts agreed though that they
could not refuse to give the homeless ones a home and a letter was
despatched at once full of warm hospitality and affection and almost
before it was posted a perfect fury of cleaning planning rearranging
burst over Moor Cottage in preparation for the four new inhabitants
Children cried Mrs Carroll delightedly when the letter arrived
your dear Cousin Charlotte is quite anxious to have you in her charming
little home in Devonshire  I know you will be happy there she is so
sweet and kind  I was always very fond of her and so will you be I
know and you must do all you can to help her and not be too troublesome
She says she can have you at any time so I think you really had better go
as soon as I can get you ready  I shall be able to see to things better
and pay a few farewell visits when I am quite free  It will be a great
relief to know you are comfortably settled
Esther listened in silence  She was terribly sensitive  She was
interested but troubled  Did Cousin Charlotte really want them she
wondered or had mother forced them on her
Penelope knew no qualms she simply danced with delight at the thought of
going to Devonshire and to live on a moor  I always wanted to go
there she cried  I know I shall love it
Angela wept quietly at the thought of leaving Framley and her mother and
the house and the woods  Poppy stood gazing eagerly from one to the
other prepared to do whatever her sisters did but puzzled to know which
to copy
Cousin Charlotte will want a big house she remarked gravely if she
has all of us to live with her  I wonder if she is glad we are comingor
sorry she added as an afterthought
What about our clothes and food and everything asked Esther presently
nervously summoning up courage to put the great question that had troubled
her most ever since the move was first mooted  She knew from bitter
experience that the very last person to trouble about such details was her
mother
Really Esther you are very inquisitive and interfering said Mrs
Carroll deeply annoyed because the question was one of the most
embarrassing that could have been put to her  Who do you consider is the
right person to attend to such matters myself or yourself
Esther sighed but made no answer  She had no doubt as to who was the
right person her doubt was as to the right persons doing it
The matter though was too important for her to be easily daunted
She felt she must know or she could not go
Andand what about our education she asked  She meant so well but
she spoke in that sullen aggressive tone that always put her in the wrong
and made her mother angry  It was purely the result of nervousness
She did so hate to have to be disagreeable and say these things making
herself seem so forward and important when she really felt just the
reverse  There was no one else though to do it so she had to
Is there a school there  We all ought to go to school now even Poppy
I am thirteen andand I dont know as much as the village children
and IIm ashamed to go anywhere or meet any one  Every one sees how
stupid and ignorant we are  A great sob clutched her throat and choked
the rest of her words tears of mortification and bitterness filled her
eyes  She was painfully conscious of her own ignorance and had an
exaggerated idea of the contempt others must feel for her  And some day
the others would come to feel the same she told herself resentfully
if nothing was done for them  It was cruel  No one seemed to care for
them or how they grew up
And then again she would hate herself for her bad temper and the nasty
things she said  She knew she was making herself unlovable and she did
so long for love
Mrs Carroll looked somewhat taken aback at this new question
Oh she stammered I suppose I must arrange something  I must talk to
your father about it when I get out to him  In the meantime I daresay
Cousin Charlotte will be able to help you a little with a few lessons
She has been a schoolmistress all her life she had a splendid school
such nice girls too  She must miss them so  She will probably be quite
glad to do a little teaching
I wonder what she will think of us said Esther if she has been
accustomed to wellbroughtup girls
Well cried Mrs Carroll turning on her sharply surely if you are so
anxious to learn you might have been studying by yourself all this time
I am sure there are books enough in the house and you knew there was no
money to spare for education
Yes there are books said Esther quietly  Fathers books that he
brought from Oxford but I cant understand them  It is books for quite
little children that I want her face flushing hotly
Well I daresay Cousin Charlotte will have loads of old schoolbooks
andand well at any rate Esther reproachfully you know how to read
and write and you might have been teaching Angela and Poppy to do so you
really might have done that
I have said Esther
Oh well that is something  When one can read there is no excuse for
ignorance in a place where there are books  There are lots of people who
have set to work and taught themselves when they have been too poor to go
to school and have doneoh marvels responded Mrs Carroll relieving
herself of any feeling of selfreproach  Because a few rare geniuses had
done so by facing difficulties and selfsacrifices such as she could not
even imagine she felt there was nothing to prevent every ordinary child
from pursuing the same course
Esther said no more a sense of hopelessness and helplessness seized her
a feeling common to most who had to do with Mrs Carroll but Esther as
yet did not know that  She walked away out of the room and the house
she felt she must get away somewhere by herself
She hurried on quickly till she came to the woods  There at any rate
there was peace and rest and no bickerings  But oh she thought as
she flung herself down on the soft springy pineneedles which lay so
thickly everywhere what shall I do when I havent the woods to come to
and she put out her hand and patted tenderly the rough trunk of the
nearest pinetree
Half an hour later she rose as bewildered and vexed as ever  Her thoughts
had led her nowhere instead of finding some way to surmount her troubles
she had just brooded and brooded and nursed her grievances until they
were larger than ever  She could not go home yet she felt too depressed
and miserable so she wandered on and on
In one little hollow in the woods was a spot they called their house
where they spent long days playing all sorts of lovely games and very
often when their mother or Lydia wanted to have a free day they had
their dinner and tea there too  Making for this place now Esther came
upon Penelope perched in the forked trunk of an old tree a book in her
hand  She was so absorbed she gave quite a start when Esther called to
her What are you doing Pen
Penelope had a deep pucker in her forehead and a very grave face
I am trying to educate myself she said soberly  I thought if I could
learn even only a little before I went to Cousin Charlottes it would not
seem so bad  But I dont seem able to get on very well  I cant
quite make out what it is all about and the words are very long
I thought Id try though  I only wish Id thought of it sooner
Esther felt a twinge of shame  She had thought of it but she had done
nothing and her inmost conscience told her she might have spent her time
