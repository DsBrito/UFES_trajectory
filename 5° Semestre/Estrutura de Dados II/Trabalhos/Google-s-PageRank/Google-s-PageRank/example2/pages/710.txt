free hand while he reeled as though seeking support against the air
When he had steadied himself he stepped forward but reeled again and
nearly fell  Then he stood still and looked at the other man who had
never turned his head
The man stood still for fully a minute as though debating with himself
Then he called out
I say Bill Ive sprained my ankle
Bill staggered on through the milky water  He did not look around  The
man watched him go and though his face was expressionless as ever his
eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer
The other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on
without looking back  The man in the stream watched him  His lips
trembled a little so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered
them was visibly agitated  His tongue even strayed out to moisten them
Bill he cried out
It was the pleading cry of a strong man in distress but Bills head did
not turn  The man watched him go limping grotesquely and lurching
forward with stammering gait up the slow slope toward the soft skyline
of the lowlying hill  He watched him go till he passed over the crest
and disappeared  Then he turned his gaze and slowly took in the circle
of the world that remained to him now that Bill was gone
Near the horizon the sun was smouldering dimly almost obscured by
formless mists and vapors which gave an impression of mass and density
without outline or tangibility  The man pulled out his watch the while
resting his weight on one leg  It was four oclock and as the season
was near the last of July or first of Augusthe did not know the
precise date within a week or twohe knew that the sun roughly marked
the northwest  He looked to the south and knew that somewhere beyond
those bleak hills lay the Great Bear Lake also he knew that in that
direction the Arctic Circle cut its forbidding way across the Canadian
Barrens  This stream in which he stood was a feeder to the Coppermine
River which in turn flowed north and emptied into Coronation Gulf and
the Arctic Ocean  He had never been there but he had seen it once on
a Hudson Bay Company chart
Again his gaze completed the circle of the world about him  It was not a
heartening spectacle  Everywhere was soft skyline  The hills were all
lowlying  There were no trees no shrubs no grassesnaught but a
tremendous and terrible desolation that sent fear swiftly dawning into
his eyes
Bill he whispered once and twice Bill
He cowered in the midst of the milky water as though the vastness were
pressing in upon him with overwhelming force brutally crushing him with
its complacent awfulness  He began to shake as with an aguefit till
the gun fell from his hand with a splash  This served to rouse him  He
fought with his fear and pulled himself together groping in the water
and recovering the weapon  He hitched his pack farther over on his left
shoulder so as to take a portion of its weight from off the injured
ankle  Then he proceeded slowly and carefully wincing with pain to
the bank
He did not stop  With a desperation that was madness unmindful of the
pain he hurried up the slope to the crest of the hill over which his
comrade had disappearedmore grotesque and comical by far than that
limping jerking comrade  But at the crest he saw a shallow valley
empty of life  He fought with his fear again overcame it hitched the
pack still farther over on his left shoulder and lurched on down the
slope
The bottom of the valley was soggy with water which the thick moss held
spongelike close to the surface  This water squirted out from under his
feet at every step and each time he lifted a foot the action culminated
in a sucking sound as the wet moss reluctantly released its grip  He
picked his way from muskeg to muskeg and followed the other mans
footsteps along and across the rocky ledges which thrust like islets
through the sea of moss
Though alone he was not lost  Farther on he knew he would come to where
dead spruce and fir very small and weazened bordered the shore of a
little lake the titchinnichilie in the tongue of the country the
land of little sticks  And into that lake flowed a small stream the
water of which was not milky  There was rushgrass on that streamthis
he remembered wellbut no timber and he would follow it till its first
trickle ceased at a divide  He would cross this divide to the first
trickle of another stream flowing to the west which he would follow
until it emptied into the river Dease and here he would find a cache
under an upturned canoe and piled over with many rocks  And in this
cache would be ammunition for his empty gun fishhooks and lines a
small netall the utilities for the killing and snaring of food  Also
he would find flournot mucha piece of bacon and some beans
Bill would be waiting for him there and they would paddle away south
down the Dease to the Great Bear Lake  And south across the lake they
would go ever south till they gained the Mackenzie  And south still
south they would go while the winter raced vainly after them and the
ice formed in the eddies and the days grew chill and crisp south to
some warm Hudson Bay Company post where timber grew tall and generous
and there was grub without end
These were the thoughts of the man as he strove onward  But hard as he
strove with his body he strove equally hard with his mind trying to
think that Bill had not deserted him that Bill would surely wait for him
at the cache  He was compelled to think this thought or else there
would not be any use to strive and he would have lain down and died  And
as the dim ball of the sun sank slowly into the northwest he covered
every inchand many timesof his and Bills flight south before the
downcoming winter  And he conned the grub of the cache and the grub of
the Hudson Bay Company post over and over again  He had not eaten for
two days for a far longer time he had not had all he wanted to eat
Often he stooped and picked pale muskeg berries put them into his mouth
and chewed and swallowed them  A muskeg berry is a bit of seed enclosed
in a bit of water  In the mouth the water melts away and the seed chews
sharp and bitter  The man knew there was no nourishment in the berries
but he chewed them patiently with a hope greater than knowledge and
defying experience
At nine oclock he stubbed his toe on a rocky ledge and from sheer
weariness and weakness staggered and fell  He lay for some time without
movement on his side  Then he slipped out of the packstraps and
clumsily dragged himself into a sitting posture  It was not yet dark
and in the lingering twilight he groped about among the rocks for shreds
of dry moss  When he had gathered a heap he built a firea
smouldering smudgy fireand put a tin pot of water on to boil
He unwrapped his pack and the first thing he did was to count his
matches  There were sixtyseven  He counted them three times to make
sure  He divided them into several portions wrapping them in oil paper
disposing of one bunch in his empty tobacco pouch of another bunch in
the inside band of his battered hat of a third bunch under his shirt on
the chest  This accomplished a panic came upon him and he unwrapped
them all and counted them again  There were still sixtyseven
He dried his wet footgear by the fire  The moccasins were in soggy
shreds  The blanket socks were worn through in places and his feet were
raw and bleeding  His ankle was throbbing and he gave it an
examination  It had swollen to the size of his knee  He tore a long
strip from one of his two blankets and bound the ankle tightly  He tore
other strips and bound them about his feet to serve for both moccasins
and socks  Then he drank the pot of water steaming hot wound his
watch and crawled between his blankets
He slept like a dead man  The brief darkness around midnight came and
went  The sun arose in the northeastat least the day dawned in that
quarter for the sun was hidden by gray clouds
At six oclock he awoke quietly lying on his back  He gazed straight up
into the gray sky and knew that he was hungry  As he rolled over on his
elbow he was startled by a loud snort and saw a bull caribou regarding
him with alert curiosity  The animal was not mere than fifty feet away
and instantly into the mans mind leaped the vision and the savor of a
caribou steak sizzling and frying over a fire  Mechanically he reached
for the empty gun drew a bead and pulled the trigger  The bull snorted
and leaped away his hoofs rattling and clattering as he fled across the
ledges
The man cursed and flung the empty gun from him  He groaned aloud as he
started to drag himself to his feet  It was a slow and arduous task
His joints were like rusty hinges  They worked harshly in their sockets
with much friction and each bending or unbending was accomplished only
through a sheer exertion of will  When he finally gained his feet
another minute or so was consumed in straightening up so that he could
stand erect as a man should stand
He crawled up a small knoll and surveyed the prospect  There were no
trees no bushes nothing but a gray sea of moss scarcely diversified by
gray rocks gray lakelets and gray streamlets  The sky was gray  There
was no sun nor hint of sun  He had no idea of north and he had
forgotten the way he had come to this spot the night before  But he was
not lost  He knew that  Soon he would come to the land of the little
sticks  He felt that it lay off to the left somewhere not farpossibly
just over the next low hill
He went back to put his pack into shape for travelling  He assured
himself of the existence of his three separate parcels of matches though
he did not stop to count them  But he did linger debating over a squat
moosehide sack  It was not large  He could hide it under his two
hands  He knew that it weighed fifteen poundsas much as all the rest
of the packand it worried him  He finally set it to one side and
proceeded to roll the pack  He paused to gaze at the squat moosehide
sack  He picked it up hastily with a defiant glance about him as though
the desolation were trying to rob him of it and when he rose to his feet
to stagger on into the day it was included in the pack on his back
He bore away to the left stopping now and again to eat muskeg berries
His ankle had stiffened his limp was more pronounced but the pain of it
was as nothing compared with the pain of his stomach  The hunger pangs
were sharp  They gnawed and gnawed until he could not keep his mind
steady on the course he must pursue to gain the land of little sticks
The muskeg berries did not allay this gnawing while they made his tongue
and the roof of his mouth sore with their irritating bite
He came upon a valley where rock ptarmigan rose on whirring wings from
the ledges and muskegs  Kerkerker was the cry they made  He threw
stones at them but could not hit them  He placed his pack on the ground
and stalked them as a cat stalks a sparrow  The sharp rocks cut through
his pants legs till his knees left a trail of blood but the hurt was
lost in the hurt of his hunger  He squirmed over the wet moss
saturating his clothes and chilling his body but he was not aware of it
so great was his fever for food  And always the ptarmigan rose
whirring before him till their kerkerker became a mock to him and
he cursed them and cried aloud at them with their own cry
Once he crawled upon one that must have been asleep  He did not see it
till it shot up in his face from its rocky nook  He made a clutch as
startled as was the rise of the ptarmigan and there remained in his hand
three tailfeathers  As he watched its flight he hated it as though it
had done him some terrible wrong  Then he returned and shouldered his
pack
As the day wore along he came into valleys or swales where game was more
plentiful  A band of caribou passed by twenty and odd animals
tantalizingly within rifle range  He felt a wild desire to run after
them a certitude that he could run them down  A black fox came toward
him carrying a ptarmigan in his mouth  The man shouted  It was a
fearful cry but the fox leaping away in fright did not drop the
ptarmigan
Late in the afternoon he followed a stream milky with lime which ran
through sparse patches of rushgrass  Grasping these rushes firmly near
the root he pulled up what resembled a young onionsprout no larger than
a shinglenail  It was tender and his teeth sank into it with a crunch
that promised deliciously of food  But its fibers were tough  It was
composed of stringy filaments saturated with water like the berries and
devoid of nourishment  He threw off his pack and went into the
rushgrass on hands and knees crunching and munching like some bovine
creature
He was very weary and often wished to restto lie down and sleep but he
was continually driven onnot so much by his desire to gain the land of
little sticks as by his hunger  He searched little ponds for frogs and
dug up the earth with his nails for worms though he knew in spite that
neither frogs nor worms existed so far north
He looked into every pool of water vainly until as the long twilight
came on he discovered a solitary fish the size of a minnow in such a
pool  He plunged his arm in up to the shoulder but it eluded him  He
reached for it with both hands and stirred up the milky mud at the
bottom  In his excitement he fell in wetting himself to the waist  Then
the water was too muddy to admit of his seeing the fish and he was
compelled to wait until the sediment had settled
The pursuit was renewed till the water was again muddied  But he could
not wait  He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool  He
baled wildly at first splashing himself and flinging the water so short
a distance that it ran back into the pool  He worked more carefully
striving to be cool though his heart was pounding against his chest and
his hands were trembling  At the end of half an hour the pool was nearly
dry  Not a cupful of water remained  And there was no fish  He found a
hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the
adjoining and larger poola pool which he could not empty in a night and
a day  Had he known of the crevice he could have closed it with a rock
at the beginning and the fish would have been his
Thus he thought and crumpled up and sank down upon the wet earth  At
first he cried softly to himself then he cried loudly to the pitiless
desolation that ringed him around and for a long time after he was
shaken by great dry sobs
He built a fire and warmed himself by drinking quarts of hot water and
made camp on a rocky ledge in the same fashion he had the night before
The last thing he did was to see that his matches were dry and to wind
his watch  The blankets were wet and clammy  His ankle pulsed with
pain  But he knew only that he was hungry and through his restless
sleep he dreamed of feasts and banquets and of food served and spread in
all imaginable ways
He awoke chilled and sick  There was no sun  The gray of earth and sky
had become deeper more profound  A raw wind was blowing and the first
flurries of snow were whitening the hilltops  The air about him
thickened and grew white while he made a fire and boiled more water  It
was wet snow half rain and the flakes were large and soggy  At first
they melted as soon as they came in contact with the earth but ever more
fell covering the ground putting out the fire spoiling his supply of
mossfuel
This was a signal for him to strap on his pack and stumble onward he
knew not where  He was not concerned with the land of little sticks nor
with Bill and the cache under the upturned canoe by the river Dease  He
was mastered by the verb to eat  He was hungermad  He took no heed
of the course he pursued so long as that course led him through the
swale bottoms  He felt his way through the wet snow to the watery muskeg
berries and went by feel as he pulled up the rushgrass by the roots
But it was tasteless stuff and did not satisfy  He found a weed that
tasted sour and he ate all he could find of it which was not much for
it was a creeping growth easily hidden under the several inches of snow
He had no fire that night nor hot water and crawled under his blanket
to sleep the broken hungersleep  The snow turned into a cold rain  He
awakened many times to feel it falling on his upturned face  Day camea
gray day and no sun  It had ceased raining  The keenness of his hunger
had departed  Sensibility as far as concerned the yearning for food
had been exhausted  There was a dull heavy ache in his stomach but it
did not bother him so much  He was more rational and once more he was
chiefly interested in the land of little sticks and the cache by the
river Dease
He ripped the remnant of one of his blankets into strips and bound his
bleeding feet  Also he recinched the injured ankle and prepared himself
for a day of travel  When he came to his pack he paused long over the
squat moosehide sack but in the end it went with him
The snow had melted under the rain and only the hilltops showed white
The sun came out and he succeeded in locating the points of the compass
though he knew now that he was lost  Perhaps in his previous days
wanderings he had edged away too far to the left  He now bore off to
the right to counteract the possible deviation from his true course
Though the hunger pangs were no longer so exquisite he realized that he
was weak  He was compelled to pause for frequent rests when he attacked
the muskeg berries and rushgrass patches  His tongue felt dry and
large as though covered with a fine hairy growth and it tasted bitter
in his mouth  His heart gave him a great deal of trouble  When he had
travelled a few minutes it would begin a remorseless thump thump thump
and then leap up and away in a painful flutter of beats that choked him
and made him go faint and dizzy
In the middle of the day he found two minnows in a large pool  It was
impossible to bale it but he was calmer now and managed to catch them in
his tin bucket  They were no longer than his little finger but he was
not particularly hungry  The dull ache in his stomach had been growing
duller and fainter  It seemed almost that his stomach was dozing  He
ate the fish raw masticating with painstaking care for the eating was
an act of pure reason  While he had no desire to eat he knew that he
must eat to live
In the evening he caught three more minnows eating two and saving the
third for breakfast  The sun had dried stray shreds of moss and he was
able to warm himself with hot water  He had not covered more than ten
miles that day and the next day travelling whenever his heart permitted
him he covered no more than five miles  But his stomach did not give
him the slightest uneasiness  It had gone to sleep  He was in a strange
country too and the caribou were growing more plentiful also the
wolves  Often their yelps drifted across the desolation and once he saw
three of them slinking away before his path
Another night and in the morning being more rational he untied the
leather string that fastened the squat moosehide sack  From its open
mouth poured a yellow stream of coarse golddust and nuggets  He roughly
divided the gold in halves caching one half on a prominent ledge
wrapped in a piece of blanket and returning the other half to the sack
He also began to use strips of the one remaining blanket for his feet  He
still clung to his gun for there were cartridges in that cache by the
river Dease
This was a day of fog and this day hunger awoke in him again  He was
very weak and was afflicted with a giddiness which at times blinded him
It was no uncommon thing now for him to stumble and fall and stumbling
once he fell squarely into a ptarmigan nest  There were four newly
hatched chicks a day oldlittle specks of pulsating life no more than a
mouthful and he ate them ravenously thrusting them alive into his mouth
and crunching them like eggshells between his teeth  The mother
ptarmigan beat about him with great outcry  He used his gun as a club
with which to knock her over but she dodged out of reach  He threw
stones at her and with one chance shot broke a wing  Then she fluttered
away running trailing the broken wing with him in pursuit
The little chicks had no more than whetted his appetite  He hopped and
bobbed clumsily along on his injured ankle throwing stones and screaming
hoarsely at times at other times hopping and bobbing silently along
picking himself up grimly and patiently when he fell or rubbing his eyes
with his hand when the giddiness threatened to overpower him
The chase led him across swampy ground in the bottom of the valley and
he came upon footprints in the soggy moss  They were not his ownhe
could see that  They must be Bills  But he could not stop for the
mother ptarmigan was running on  He would catch her first then he would
return and investigate
He exhausted the mother ptarmigan but he exhausted himself  She lay
panting on her side  He lay panting on his side a dozen feet away
unable to crawl to her  And as he recovered she recovered fluttering
out of reach as his hungry hand went out to her  The chase was resumed
Night settled down and she escaped  He stumbled from weakness and
pitched head foremost on his face cutting his cheek his pack upon his
back  He did not move for a long while then he rolled over on his side
wound his watch and lay there until morning
Another day of fog  Half of his last blanket had gone into
footwrappings  He failed to pick up Bills trail  It did not matter
His hunger was driving him too compellinglyonlyonly he wondered if
Bill too were lost  By midday the irk of his pack became too
oppressive  Again he divided the gold this time merely spilling half of
it on the ground  In the afternoon he threw the rest of it away there
remaining to him only the halfblanket the tin bucket and the rifle
An hallucination began to trouble him  He felt confident that one
cartridge remained to him  It was in the chamber of the rifle and he had
overlooked it  On the other hand he knew all the time that the chamber
was empty  But the hallucination persisted  He fought it off for hours
then threw his rifle open and was confronted with emptiness  The
disappointment was as bitter as though he had really expected to find the
cartridge
He plodded on for half an hour when the hallucination arose again  Again
he fought it and still it persisted till for very relief he opened his
rifle to unconvince himself  At times his mind wandered farther afield
and he plodded on a mere automaton strange conceits and whimsicalities
gnawing at his brain like worms  But these excursions out of the real
were of brief duration for ever the pangs of the hungerbite called him
back  He was jerked back abruptly once from such an excursion by a sight
that caused him nearly to faint  He reeled and swayed doddering like a
drunken man to keep from falling  Before him stood a horse  A horse  He
could not believe his eyes  A thick mist was in them intershot with
sparkling points of light  He rubbed his eyes savagely to clear his
vision and beheld not a horse but a great brown bear  The animal was
studying him with bellicose curiosity
The man had brought his gun halfway to his shoulder before he realized
He lowered it and drew his huntingknife from its beaded sheath at his
hip  Before him was meat and life  He ran his thumb along the edge of
his knife  It was sharp  The point was sharp  He would fling himself
upon the bear and kill it  But his heart began its warning thump thump
thump  Then followed the wild upward leap and tattoo of flutters the
pressing as of an iron band about his forehead the creeping of the
dizziness into his brain
His desperate courage was evicted by a great surge of fear  In his
weakness what if the animal attacked him  He drew himself up to his
most imposing stature gripping the knife and staring hard at the bear
The bear advanced clumsily a couple of steps reared up and gave vent to
a tentative growl  If the man ran he would run after him but the man
did not run  He was animated now with the courage of fear  He too
growled savagely terribly voicing the fear that is to life germane and
that lies twisted about lifes deepest roots
The bear edged away to one side growling menacingly himself appalled by
this mysterious creature that appeared upright and unafraid  But the man
did not move  He stood like a statue till the danger was past when he
yielded to a fit of trembling and sank down into the wet moss
He pulled himself together and went on afraid now in a new way  It was
not the fear that he should die passively from lack of food but that he
should be destroyed violently before starvation had exhausted the last
particle of the endeavor in him that made toward surviving  There were
the wolves  Back and forth across the desolation drifted their howls
weaving the very air into a fabric of menace that was so tangible that he
found himself arms in the air pressing it back from him as it might be
the walls of a windblown tent
Now and again the wolves in packs of two and three crossed his path
But they sheered clear of him  They were not in sufficient numbers and
besides they were hunting the caribou which did not battle while this
strange creature that walked erect might scratch and bite
In the late afternoon he came upon scattered bones where the wolves had
made a kill  The debris had been a caribou calf an hour before
squawking and running and very much alive  He contemplated the bones
cleanpicked and polished pink with the celllife in them which had not
yet died  Could it possibly be that he might be that ere the day was
done  Such was life eh  A vain and fleeting thing  It was only life
that pained  There was no hurt in death  To die was to sleep  It meant
cessation rest  Then why was he not content to die
But he did not moralize long  He was squatting in the moss a bone in
his mouth sucking at the shreds of life that still dyed it faintly pink
The sweet meaty taste thin and elusive almost as a memory maddened him
He closed his jaws on the bones and crunched  Sometimes it was the bone
that broke sometimes his teeth  Then he crushed the bones between
rocks pounded them to a pulp and swallowed them  He pounded his
fingers too in his haste and yet found a moment in which to feel
surprise at the fact that his fingers did not hurt much when caught under
the descending rock
Came frightful days of snow and rain  He did not know when he made camp
when he broke camp  He travelled in the night as much as in the day  He
rested wherever he fell crawled on whenever the dying life in him
flickered up and burned less dimly  He as a man no longer strove  It
was the life in him unwilling to die that drove him on  He did not
suffer  His nerves had become blunted numb while his mind was filled
with weird visions and delicious dreams
But ever he sucked and chewed on the crushed bones of the caribou calf
the least remnants of which he had gathered up and carried with him  He
crossed no more hills or divides but automatically followed a large
stream which flowed through a wide and shallow valley  He did not see
this stream nor this valley  He saw nothing save visions  Soul and body
walked or crawled side by side yet apart so slender was the thread that
bound them
He awoke in his right mind lying on his back on a rocky ledge  The sun
was shining bright and warm  Afar off he heard the squawking of caribou
calves  He was aware of vague memories of rain and wind and snow but
whether he had been beaten by the storm for two days or two weeks he did
not know
For some time he lay without movement the genial sunshine pouring upon
him and saturating his miserable body with its warmth  A fine day he
thought  Perhaps he could manage to locate himself  By a painful effort
he rolled over on his side  Below him flowed a wide and sluggish river
Its unfamiliarity puzzled him  Slowly he followed it with his eyes
winding in wide sweeps among the bleak bare hills bleaker and barer and
lowerlying than any hills he had yet encountered  Slowly deliberately
without excitement or more than the most casual interest he followed the
course of the strange stream toward the skyline and saw it emptying into
a bright and shining sea  He was still unexcited  Most unusual he
thought a vision or a miragemore likely a vision a trick of his
disordered mind  He was confirmed in this by sight of a ship lying at
anchor in the midst of the shining sea  He closed his eyes for a while
then opened them  Strange how the vision persisted  Yet not strange  He
knew there were no seas or ships in the heart of the barren lands just
as he had known there was no cartridge in the empty rifle
He heard a snuffle behind hima halfchoking gasp or cough  Very
slowly because of his exceeding weakness and stiffness he rolled over
on his other side  He could see nothing near at hand but he waited
patiently  Again came the snuffle and cough and outlined between two
jagged rocks not a score of feet away he made out the gray head of a
wolf  The sharp ears were not pricked so sharply as he had seen them on
other wolves the eyes were bleared and bloodshot the head seemed to
droop limply and forlornly  The animal blinked continually in the
sunshine  It seemed sick  As he looked it snuffled and coughed again
This at least was real he thought and turned on the other side so
that he might see the reality of the world which had been veiled from him
before by the vision  But the sea still shone in the distance and the
ship was plainly discernible  Was it reality after all  He closed his
eyes for a long while and thought and then it came to him  He had been
making north by east away from the Dease Divide and into the Coppermine
Valley  This wide and sluggish river was the Coppermine  That shining
sea was the Arctic Ocean  That ship was a whaler strayed east far
east from the mouth of the Mackenzie and it was lying at anchor in
Coronation Gulf  He remembered the Hudson Bay Company chart he had seen
long ago and it was all clear and reasonable to him
He sat up and turned his attention to immediate affairs  He had worn
through the blanketwrappings and his feet were shapeless lumps of raw
meat  His last blanket was gone  Rifle and knife were both missing  He
had lost his hat somewhere with the bunch of matches in the band but
the matches against his chest were safe and dry inside the tobacco pouch
and oil paper  He looked at his watch  It marked eleven oclock and was
still running  Evidently he had kept it wound
He was calm and collected  Though extremely weak he had no sensation of
pain  He was not hungry  The thought of food was not even pleasant to
him and whatever he did was done by his reason alone  He ripped off his
pants legs to the knees and bound them about his feet  Somehow he had
succeeded in retaining the tin bucket  He would have some hot water
before he began what he foresaw was to be a terrible journey to the ship
His movements were slow  He shook as with a palsy  When he started to
collect dry moss he found he could not rise to his feet  He tried again
and again then contented himself with crawling about on hands and knees
Once he crawled near to the sick wolf  The animal dragged itself
reluctantly out of his way licking its chops with a tongue which seemed
hardly to have the strength to curl  The man noticed that the tongue was
not the customary healthy red  It was a yellowish brown and seemed
coated with a rough and halfdry mucus
After he had drunk a quart of hot water the man found he was able to
stand and even to walk as well as a dying man might be supposed to walk
Every minute or so he was compelled to rest  His steps were feeble and
uncertain just as the wolfs that trailed him were feeble and uncertain
and that night when the shining sea was blotted out by blackness he
knew he was nearer to it by no more than four miles
Throughout the night he heard the cough of the sick wolf and now and
then the squawking of the caribou calves  There was life all around him
but it was strong life very much alive and well and he knew the sick
wolf clung to the sick mans trail in the hope that the man would die
first  In the morning on opening his eyes he beheld it regarding him
with a wistful and hungry stare  It stood crouched with tail between
its legs like a miserable and woebegone dog  It shivered in the chill
morning wind and grinned dispiritedly when the man spoke to it in a
voice that achieved no more than a hoarse whisper
The sun rose brightly and all morning the man tottered and fell toward
the ship on the shining sea  The weather was perfect  It was the brief
Indian Summer of the high latitudes  It might last a week  Tomorrow or
next day it might he gone
