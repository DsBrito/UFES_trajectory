WILLIAM II
AND
FRANCISJOSEPH
CHAPTER I
If only Emperor William would be true to himselfbe natural
in fact exclaimed Count S a Prussian nobleman high in the
diplomatic service of his country with whom I was discussing the
German Emperor a year or so ago Then my friend who had a short
time previously been brought into frequent personal contact with his
sovereign in connection with his official duties went on to say
There are really two distinct characters one might almost say
two personalities in the kaiser When he is himself he is the most
charming companion that it is possible to conceive His manners are as
genial and as winning as those of his father and grandfather both
of whom he surpasses in brilliancy of intellect and in quickness
of repartee as well as in a keen sense of humor He gives one
the impression of possessing a heart full of the most generous
impulsesaye of a generosity carried even to excess and this
together with a species of indescribable magnetism which appears to
radiate from him in these moments contributes to render him a most
sympathetic man
But interposed an Englishman who was present that is not how he
is portrayed to the outer world Nor is that the impression which he
made upon me and upon others when he was at Cowes
That is precisely why I deplore so much that the emperor should
fail to appear in his true colors continued Count S All
the qualities which I have just now ascribed to him are too often
concealed beneath a mantle of reserve selfconsciousness nay
even pose During my recent interviews with his majesty whenever we
happened to be alone he would show himself in the light which I
have just described to you But let a third person appear upon the
scenebe it even a mere servantat once his entire manner would
change The magnetic current so pleasantly established between us
would be cut through his eyes would lose their kindly friendly
light and become hard his attitude selfconscious and constrained
the very tone of his speech sharp abrupt commanding I would almost
say arrogant In fact he would give one the impression that he was
playing a rolethe role of emperorthat he was in one word posing
even if it were only for the benefit of the menial who had interrupted
us But when the intruder had vanished William would like a flash
become his own charming self again That is what made me exclaim just
now if only the kaiser would be true to himselfbe natural in
fact
I fully agree with you my dear S I remarked after a short
pause If the emperor has remained anything like what he was prior
to his ascension to the throne your estimate of his character is
correct And I went on to relate a little incident which occurred on
the occasion of my first meeting with the emperor many years ago
This meeting took place on that particular spot where the empires of
Germany Austria and Russia may be said to meet the frontier guards
of each of those three nations being within hail of one another
The great autumnal military manoeuvres were in progress and a merry
party including a number of ladies were riding home from the mimic
battlefield We passed through a narrow lane bordered on each side by
groups of stunted willows and birch trees under the sparse shadow of
which nestled a few cottages painted in blue pink or yellow in
true Polish fashion Suddenly our progress was arrested by terrifying
screams proceeding from one of these hovels Several of us were out of
our saddles in an instant and rushed in at the low door
Before the hearth where a huge peatfire was burning stood a young
peasant woman her face distorted with agonized grief and holding in
her arms a bundle of blackened rags We found that her baby had fallen
into the glowing embers while she herself was occupied out of doors
and the poor mite was so badly burned that there seemed but little
hope of its ever reviving from its state of almost complete coma We
were all busying ourselves eagerly about the child and its distraught
mother when raising my eyes from the palpitating form of the child
I caught sight of Prince William as the kaiser was then called
standing near the door apparently quite undisturbed and unmoved by
this tragedy in lowly life It even seemed to me in the dim light as
if he were smiling derisively at our efforts to relieve the sufferings
of the little one and to soothe the grief of its mother But my
indignation vanished quickly when a slanting ray of the setting sun
piercing through the grime of the little window revealed the presence
on his cheek of two very large and bonafide tears which had
welled up in his eyes to which the lad was endeavoring to impart an
expression of callous indifference and when at last we left the hut
to seek a doctor for the tiny sufferer it was Prince Williams own
military coat none too new and even to say the truth much worn
that remained as an additional coverlet upon the roughlyhewn wooden
cot over which the sobbing mother was bending
Nobody I added will therefore make me believe that Emperor
William has not got a very soft spot in his heart and that beneath
the mannerisms which he considers it necessary to affect in order to
maintain the dignity of his position as emperorthose mannerisms
which have given rise to so much misapprehension about his
characterthere is not concealed a very kindly spirit literally
brimming over with generous impulses which if more widely known
would serve to render the kaiser the most popular as he is the most
interesting figure of Old World royalty
It is because Emperor FrancisJoseph and the veteran King of Saxony
are so thoroughly acquainted with his real nature that they are truly
and honestly fond of him Both of them old men with no sons in whom
to seek support for the eventide of lives that have been saddened by
many a public and private sorrow they entertain a fatherly affection
for William who as emperor treats them in public as brother
sovereigns and as equals but accords to them in private the most
touching filial deference and regard remembering full well the
kindness which both of them showed to him when he was still the
muchsnubbed and not altogether justlytreated Prince William They
on their side are led by his behavior towards them to regard him in
the light of a son Of course they cannot be blind to his faults but
they are disposed to treat them with an indulgence that is even more
than paternal and to see in them relatively trivial defects due
to the manner in which he was brought up and which are certain to
disappear with advancing years and experience
During his early manhood Prince William was by no means a favorite
either at his grandfathers court or at that of any other foreign
sovereign which he was occasionally allowed to visit Palefaced and
delicatelooking very severely treated by his mother who is what one
is bound to call une maitresse femme the boy at seventeen was by no
manner of means prepossessing and his efforts to assert himself and
to crush down a good deal of natural awkwardness and timidity added to
his singularly unlikeable appearance
In those days it could clearly be seen that everything that he did or
said was meant to create an impression of dignity and of grandeur to
which his physique did not lend itself very easily and the contrast
between him and his bosom friend the courteous graceful and dashing
Crown Prince of Austria was very marked
Goodhearted and endowed with a great many truly generous instincts
the young fellow was however sorely handicapped by his education
the abnormal strictness displayed towards him at the Court of Berlin
and also by a continually and most distressingly empty purse It is a
hard and almost pitiful thing for the heir apparent of a great empire
to find himself often without the necessary amount with which to cut
the figure which his social rank forces him to adopt and it must have
been especially galling to the overbearing and proud nature of this
boy to be continually obliged to borrow from his friends nay even
from his aides de camp small sums wherewith to pay his way wherever
he went Nevertheless his father and mother then Crown Prince and
Crown Princess of Germany believed it to be a thoroughly wholesome
thing for the young man to have to humble his pride should he not be
content with the very small allowance made to him this unfortunate
idea being however the cause of a great deal of bitterness which to
this day has not completely faded from the heart of the now omnipotent
ruler of the German Empire
It is undeniable that many eccentricities and false moves on the part
of William II have been grossly exaggerated and placed before the
public in a false light showing him up as a conceited bumptious
and silly person whereas not only his state of health but his
entourage should have been blamed for whatever he did that was out
of place During a great many years the young prince suffered from
what is called technically otitis media namely a disease of the
middle ear very painful exasperating and even somewhat humiliating
to endure and which he must have inherited in some extraordinary way
from his greatuncle King William IV of Prussia who died insane
There are certainly some traits of resemblance between this hapless
monarch and the present occupant of the German throne for in both
there exists and has existed the same exaggerated and narrowminded
religious beliefs bordering on mysticism and also an allembracing
faith in their absolute and unquestionable infallibility
It has long since become a wellanchored creed that William II has
occasional fits of insanity This is by no means the case but it must
be admitted that the peculiar malady to which I referred above and
which is as yet not eradicated from his system causes him at times
days of the most excruciating pains all over the back and side of his
head and it is scarcely surprising that at such moments the emperor
should act in a way which astonishes the uninitiated Indeed William
II displays extraordinary force of character in suppressing physical
agony when the duties he owes to the state force him to come forward
when unfit for anything else but the sick room
The truth of the matter is that there are but few who can boast of
knowing him well and the masses as well as the classes both at home
and abroad seem to take a peculiarly keen delight in accepting for
gospel truth any sweeping statements made about him by the press of
all civilized countries
Although twentynine years of age when he ascended the throne on June
15 1888 he may be said to have been at that time still but a raw
youth continually kept in the background and treated more or less
like a child without any consequence or weight It is therefore
not remarkable that the first years of his reign should have been
signalized by many errors of judgment for it is not with impunity
that one suddenly releases a person locked up for years in a dark
room and drives him into dazzlinglylighted spaces without a guide
a philosopher or a friend by his side to lead him on the way
The mental as well as the physical optic has to gradually become
accustomed to so complete a change and this fact was not sufficiently
taken into consideration by all the detractors of the young monarch
when he to speak very familiarly leaped over the saddle in his
anxiety to secure for himself a firm seat on the throne of his
forefathers
It is well to mention also that Emperor Frederick III who reigned
alas but for a few weeks was positively worshipped by the German
people and not without cause for he was undoubtedly one of the
finest personalities of this century His appearance his demeanor
his unaffected dignity kindness of heart and loftiness of purpose
were difficult to surpass and it was a bitter disappointment to his
subjects when death snatched him away before he had had time to carry
out the grand plans and ideas which he had long cherished and reserved
for the time when he would have the reins of government in his own
hands
Speaking with all kindness and goodwill one cannot but after
a fashion understand the disappointment of the Germans when this
towering military figure this magnificent specimen of perfect
physical and mental manhood vanished from their ken to be replaced
by the slender palefaced somewhat arrogant and despotic young man
who resembled this father so little
Emperor William II is an extremely intelligent personage in spite
of all that may have been said to the contrary He thinks for himself
when he has a mind to do so and what is more thinks logically and
is quite capable of following a thus logicallyattained conclusion to
its furthermost point He feels keenly his enormous responsibilities
and the tremendous international importance of his position as the
ruler of over 50000000 people for he well knows that any man
wearing on his head the double crown of King of Prussia and of German
Emperor is a being endowed with powers which are bound to compel
attention from every point of the European Continent Being given as
I have just remarked that his health and his physique are neither of
them of a kind to aid him in the tremendous task which belongs to him
by right of birth it is easily explainable that his selfassertive
ways and imperious manners should often be mistaken for posing and
posturing Moreover his imperfect left arma misfortune which has
been a source of great distress to him ever since his birthis but
another one of those physical troubles which his pride makes him
anxious to conceal this only adding to his stilted and repellent
attitude In spite of all these drawbacks the emperor fences
exceedingly well rides with pluck and even skill managing to hold
his reins with his poor withered left hand when in uniform in order
to keep his swordarm free and during his visit to Austrian Poland
which I referred to at the beginning of this chapter I more than once
saw him with my own eyes whilst we were riding across country take
obstacles which would have made a far older and more experienced
hunter pause and reflect on
Nobody even the bestintentioned can deny that Emperor William has
many faults those are however either ignored altogether or else
exaggerated to an extent that eclipses all his good qualities by his
various biographers Very few penportraits of royal personages that
pass through the hands of the publishers can be said to present a true
picture of their subject Either the writer holds up the object of his
literary effort as a person so blameless as to suggest the idea that
he is an impossible prig or else every piece of malevolent gossip is
construed into a positive fact his shortcomings magnified until they
lose all touch of resemblance while every word and action capable of
misrepresentation is construed in the manner most detrimental to his
reputation In one word he is either glorified as a preposterous
saint or else held up to public execration as an equally impossible
villain Now in pictorial art a portrait in order to present a
satisfactory and successful resemblance to its subject must contain
lights and shadows You cannot have all light or all shadow but it
is necessary to have a judicious mixture of both So it is with the
art of biography If one wishes to give in print a true and above
all a human picture of ones subject it is necessary to mingle the
shadows with the lights In fact the former may be said to set off
the latter and there are many shortcomings especially those
which the French so graphically describe as petits vicessmall
viceswhich resulting from a generous and impulsive temperament
serve like the Rembrandt shadow of a portrait to render the subject
more attractive to the eye
It is my object not to give a definitive biography of either of the
two kaisers or even a mere record of their vie intime but rather
to present to my readers a series of incidents full of lights and
full of shadows showing their surroundings describing as far as
possible the atmosphere in which they move the conditions of life
which they are obliged to consider the temptations to which they
are exposedand to which they sometimes succumband when I have
completed my task I venture to believe that the readers of these
volumes while they may find the two emperors neither quite so
blameless nor yet quite so bad as they expected may nevertheless
experience a greater degree of sympathy and regard for them as being
after all so extremely human
CHAPTER II
While Emperor FrancisJoseph is justly reputed to have played sad
havoc with the hearts of the fair sex in his dominions especially in
his younger days having inherited that frivolity with regard to women
which is a traditional characteristic of the illustrious House of
Hapsburg he has never at any moment during his long reign permitted
his susceptibility to feminine charms to go to the length of
influencing his political conduct or the action of his government
Emperor William on the other hand whose married life has been from
a domestic point of view singularly blameless and who has been
an exceptionally faithful husband has in at least two instances
permitted himself to be swayed in his role of sovereign by ladies
who for a time figured as his Egerias One of them was a woman of
extraordinary cleverness and an American by birth who while she has
long since ceased to exercise any influence upon him has retained the
affection and the regard of both his consort and himself She is the
Countess Waldersee daughter of the late David Lee a wholesale
grocer of New York and who at the time that she became the wife of
Fieldmarshal Count Waldersee was the widow of the present German
empresss uncle Prince Frederick of SchleswigHolstein The latter
abandoned his royal rank and titles and assumed the merely nobiliary
status of a Prince of Noer in order to make her his consort
The countess is treated as an aunt by both William and the kaiserin
and she may be said to have swayed her imperial nephew by her
cleverness and intellectual brilliancy rather than by her looks for
she is a woman already welladvanced in years
Different in this respect was the influence of the emperors other
Egeria namely the Polish baroness Jenny Koscielska a woman of rare
elegance and beauty whose political importance during the time
she reigned supreme at the Court of Berlin was attributable to her
personal fascination rather than to her sagacity or statecraft She
is the wife of that Baron KosciolKoscielski who was one of the most
celebrated leaders of the Polish party in the Russian House of Lords
and perhaps also the most popular of all modern Polish poets and
playwrights
It would be going too far to assert that William was infatuated by her
loveliness Yet there Is no doubt that as long as she figured at the
Court of Berlin he not only paid her the most marked attention but
likewise allowed himself to be advised by her in political matters
It was during the socalled reign of the baroness that the kaiser
showed such an extraordinary degree of favor to his Polish subjects as
to excite the jealousy and illwill of the people in many other parts
of his dominions He reestablished the Polish language in the schools
and churches of Posen that is of PrussianPoland nominated a Polish
ecclesiastic to the archbishopric of that province and conferred so
many court dignities government offices and decorations upon the
compatriots of the fair Jenny as to give rise to the remark that the
best road to imperial preferment at Berlin was to add the Polish and
feminine termination of ska to ones name Old Prince Bismarck who
was at the time at daggersdrawn with his young sovereign at length
gave public utterance to the popular illwill excited by the role
of Egeria which the baroness was accused of playing to the Numa
Pompilius of Emperor William For in the course of an address
delivered by the old exchancellor at Friedrichsruh and reproduced in
extenso in the press he declared among other things that The Polish
influence in political affairs increases always in the measure that
some Polish family obtains of more or less influence at Court I need
not allude here to the role formerly played by the princely house of
Radziwill Today we have exactly the same state of affairs which
is to be deplored Bismarcks allusion to the Radziwills was an
ungenerous reference to the romantic attachment of old Emperor William
for that Princess Elize Radziwill whom he was so determined to marry
that he offered his father to abandon his rights of succession to the
throne on her account This King FrederickWilliam would not permit
and William was compelled to wed Goethes pupil Princess Augusta
of SaxeWeimar A loveless match in every sense of the word for he
remained until the day of Princess Elizes death her most devoted
friend and admirer seeking her advice in many a difficulty to the
great annoyance of Prince Bismarck who detested her and after her
death the old emperor continued to show the utmost favor and goodwill
to the members of her family in honor of her memory Of course this
speech of Prince Bismarck created no end of a sensation throughout the
empire as well as abroad the press being encouraged thereby to
print in cold type what had until that time been merely whispered
in official and court circles It is possible that the young emperor
might have remained indifferent to popular clamor about the matter
had not two other incidents occurred about the same time to cool his
liking for the fair Jenny
In the first place she felt herself so much encouraged by the
influence which she believed that she exercised over the emperor that
when during the annual army manoeuvres Field Marshal Prince George of
Saxony and other Prussian and foreign royalties were quartered under
her roof she absolutely declined to hoist either the German flag or
the Royal Saxon standard but insisted upon flying the national
colors of Poland from the flag staff that surmounted the turret of
her chateau Naturally Prince George and his fellow royal guests
complained of this breach of etiquette to the kaiser and protested
strongly against it
Almost at the same time her husband the baron having been invited
to attend the opening of a provincial exhibition in the neighboring
Empire of Austria was so carried away by enthusiasm due to the
kindness with which the Poles present were treated by Emperor
FrancisJoseph that forgetting all he owed to Emperor William
he publicly hailed FrancisJoseph as sole sovereign of all Polish
hearts and as Polands future king About this time too the
empress paid a couple of rather mysterious visits to her motherinlaw
at Friedrichkron Court gossip ascribed these hurried trips to
the fact that the empress had been prompted by her jealousy of the
baroness to invoke the intervention of the strongminded widow of
Frederick the Noble But it is far more likely that the empress
visited the Dowager Kaiserin in order that she should call the
attention of her son to the harm which the association of the name of
the baroness with his own was doing him in a political sense both at
home and abroad
Whatever the cause of these consultations between the two
empresses may have been the fact remains that almost immediately
afterwards Baron and Baroness Koscielski received from the
GrandMasteroftheCourt Count Eulenburg an official intimation
that their presence at court was not desired in highest quarters until
further notice and that under the circumstances they would do well
to remain at their country seat In fact they were virtually banished
and when both husband and wife travelled all the way to Berlin with
the object of asking for an explanation from the emperor he declined
to receive either the one or the other He had apparently come to the
conclusion that the game was not worth the candle and that in view
of the fact that his intimacy with the baroness had never gone beyond
platonic friendship and mild flirtation it was ridiculous to incur
the illwill of his subjects and expose himself to slanderous stories
concocted by his enemies on her account
The influence of the American born Countess Waldersee was of a far
more lasting character and may be said to have been inaugurated
very shortly after his marriage Prior to becoming a benedict Prince
William was as gay as his very limited financial means would permit
In fact he was charged with playing the role of Don Juan to at least
half a dozen beauties of the Prussian Court while at Vienna he became
involved in a scandal of a feminine character from which he was only
extricated with the utmost difficulty by the then German Ambassador to
the Austrian Court namely Prince Reuss The presumption is that he
had allowed himself to become the prey of an adventuress and with the
object of avoiding publicity he was practically compelled to provide
for the welfare and future of a child which may or may not have been
his offspring But as soon as he married he turned over a new leaf
and became the very model of husbands
It has always been my conviction that this was due in part to the
influence of the Countess Waldersee and largely also to the unkindly
treatment which his consort received during the early years of
her marriage at the hands of his family Although a nice and
gentlelooking girl AugustaVictoria was far from shining either by
her beauty or her elegance at a court which is one of the most cruelly
critical and satirical in all Europe Moreover she labored under the
disadvantage of being the daughter of the Duchess of Augustenburg who
is not credited with a robust intellect and in fact has passed
the greater part of her life in retirement and of the Duke of
Augustenburg who was famed thirty years ago for the dullness of his
mind In fact after Prussia had undertaken in his behalf the conquest
of the Duchy of SchleswigHolstein to which he was entitled by right
of inheritance and which had been unlawfully seized by Denmark
Prince Bismarck refused to permit the duke to assume the sovereignty
thereof on the publicly expressed ground that it would be an act of
the most outrageous tyranny to subject any state to the rule of so
intensely stupid a man as the duke
This utterance on the part of Bismarck which may be found in most
of the German histories printed prior to the accession of the present
Emperor was naturally recalled to mind at the Court of Berlin when
the daughter of the duke became the bride of Prince William and the
widespread belief in her inherited dullness of intellect was further
increased by the mingled impatience and pity which characterized the
behavior of her husbands mother and sisters towards her
There is much that is chivalrous in the nature of the present German
emperor and it was precisely the unkindness and slights to which his
bride was subjected that had the effect of drawing him more closely
to her He did not conceal the fact that he strongly resented the
attitude of his family towards her and his friendship with Countess
Waldersee owes its origin to the motherly way in which she behaved
to his wife acting as her mentor as her adviser and guide in the
intricate maze of Berlin society and of court life Debarred from all
intimacy with her sistersinlaw who were ever ready to scoff at and
to make fun of her AugustaVictoria was wont to have recourse to
the countess in all her difficulties and inasmuch as Count Waldersee
himself is the most brilliant soldier of the German army and was
designated at the time by the great Moltke as his successor and his
principal lieutenant Prince William and his wife ended by becoming
very intimate indeed with the Waldersees and almost daily visitors at
their house
The countess is of a deeply religious turn of mind with a strong
disposition towards evangelism and already before the marriage
of Prince William she had become conspicuous as one of the most
influential leaders of the antiSemite party in Prussia It was in her
salons at Berlin that the great Jewbaiter Stoecker was wont to hold
his politicoreligious meetings denouncing the Jews and it was
through her influence too that he obtained appointment as court
chaplain in spite of the opposition of the father and the mother of
Prince William It was also under the roof of the Countess Waldersee
that the present emperor became imbued with that very religiousone
might almost say pietistdisposition which has since been so marked
a feature of his character
True the hereditary tendency of the sovereign house of Prussia is
distinctly religious leaning in fact towards fanaticism and King
FrederickWilliam III his son FrederickWilliam IV and likewise
old Emperor William entertained the most extraordinary ideas on the
subject of Providence with which they believed themselves to be in
constant communion as well as its principal agent here on earth
In fact there is hardly a public utterance of any of these three
sovereigns which is not marked throughout by a deep religious tone
and by a degree of familiarity with the Almighty which would be
blasphemous were it not so manifestly sincere This hereditary
tendency towards religion was to a certain extent obliterated by the
education which William received and which was of a nature to dispose
him to be both a materialist and a freethinker He may be said
in fact to have been brought up in an atmosphere of Renanism and
Straussism for which his extraordinary and mercilessly clever
mother Empress Frederick was largely responsible and at the moment
of his marriage it looked as if he were destined to figure in history
as quite as much of a philosopher and even atheist as Frederick the
Great for whom he professed the most profound veneration
It was Countess Waldersee who revived all the inherited and latent
religious tendencies of his character
Up to the time when he ascended the throne Prince William and his
consort were constant and devout attendants at the prayermeetings
held in the salons of the countess and if he remains to this day
a remarkably religious man with a sufficient regard for scriptural
commands to have shown himself a more faithful husband than any other
prince of his house either living or deadif today piety is
fashionable at the court of Berlin instead of being bad form if the
building or endowment of a church or of a charitable institution
is regarded as the surest road to imperial favor it is due to the
influence of Williams American aunt the daughter of that New
York grocer the first Princess Noer and who is today Countess of
Waldersee
It is natural that the influence exercised over William and his
wife by the countess should have given rise to the utmost jealousy
especially on the part of his mother Empress Frederick and during
the hundred days reign of her lamented husband she availed herself
of her brief spell of power to secure the virtual banishment of the
count and the countess from Berlin by causing the field marshal to
be transferred from the chieftaincy of the headquarter staff to
the command of the army stationed in Altona Moreover she did not
hesitate to denounce the influence of the Waldersees as disastrous
as illiberal and in every sense of the word reactionary and if her
husband Emperor Frederick was led to share her views concerning
them it was because of his disapproval of the movement against the
Jews in which the countess had figured so conspicuously It is a
peculiar fact that although Emperor William has always remained on
