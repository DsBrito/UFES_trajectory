Especially if it is a good story or a bit of lovely poetry she
added
Yes he said well have both those in turn and some solid reading
besides
I dont like solid reading she returned with a charming pout
One may cultivate a taste for it I think he answered pleasantly
But you cant cultivate what you havent got she objected
True enough he said laughing Well then well try to get a little
first and cultivate it carefully afterward I must go now love he
added releasing her the men need some directions from me in regard
to their work
And the women some from me said Zoe Oh you neednt laugh Ned
shaking her finger at him as he turned in the doorway to give her an
amused glance perhaps some of these days youll find out that I am
really an accomplished housewife capable of giving orders and
directions too
No doubt my dear for I am already proud of you in that capacity he
said throwing her a smiling kiss then hurrying away
Zoe summoned Aunt Dicey the housekeeper gave her orders for the day
and the needed supplies from pantry and storeroom they went to the
sewingroom to give some directions to Christine and Alma
She lingered there for a little trying on a morningdress they were
making for her then repaired to her boudoir intent upon beginning her
studies which had been rather neglected of late in the excitement of
the preparations for the departure of the greater part of the family for
a winter at Viamede
But she had scarcely taken out her books when the sound of wheels on
the avenue attracted her attention and glancing from the window she
saw the Roselands carriage draw up at the front entrance and Ella Conly
alight from it and run up the veranda steps
There Ill not do much studying today Im afraid said Zoe half
aloud for even if its only a call she has come for shell not leave
under an hour
She hastily replaced the books in the drawer from which she had taken
themfor she had a feeling only half acknowledged even to herself of
repugnance to having Ella know of her studiesElla who had graduated
from boardingschool and evidently felt herself thoroughly
educatedand hurried down to meet and welcome her guest
I told Cal and Art I thought youd be sure to feel dreadfully lonely
today after seeing everybody but Ned start off on a long journey and
so Id come and spend the day with you said Ella when the two had
exchanged kisses and inquiries after each others health
It was very kind and thoughtful in you returned Zoe leading the way
into the parlor usually occupied by the family where an open wood fire
blazed cheerily on the hearth
Take this easychair wont you she said wheeling it a little
nearer the grate and Dinah shall carry away your wraps when it suits
you to doff them I wish cousins Cal and Art would invite themselves to
dine with us too
Arts very busy just now said Ella theres a good deal of sickness
and I dont believe hes spent a whole night at home for the last week
or more
Dear me I wouldnt be a doctor for any thing nor a doctors wife
exclaimed Zoe
Well I dont know theres something to be said on both sides of that
question laughed Ella I can tell you Art would make a mighty good
husband and its very handy in ease of sickness to have the doctor in
the house
Yes but according to your account hes generally somewhere else than
in his own house returned Zoe playfully
Ella laughed Yes she said doctors do have a hard life but if you
say so to Art he always says he has never regretted having chosen the
medical profession because it affords so many opportunities for doing
good Its plain he makes that the business of his life Im proud of
Art I dont believe theres a better man anywhere I was sick last
summer and you wouldnt believe how kindly he nursed me
You cant tell me any thing about him that I should think too good to
believe said Zoe Hes our family doctor you remember and of
course we are all attached to him on that account as well as because
of the relationship
Yes to be sure There Dinah you may carry away my hat and cloak
Ella said divesting herself of them as she spoke but leave the
satchel I brought my fancywork Zoe one has to be industrious now as
Christmas is coming I decided to embroider a pair of slippers for each
of my three brothers Walter does not expect to get home so I made his
first as they had to travel so far Im nearly done with Arts and
then I have Cals to do
Oh how pretty exclaimed Zoe examining the work and thats a new
stitch wont you teach it to me
Yes indeed with pleasure And I want you to teach me how to crochet
that lace I saw you making the other day I thought it so pretty
The two spent a pleasant morning chatting together over their
fancywork saying nothing very wise perhaps but neither did they say
any thing harmful an innocent jest now and again somethingusually
laudatoryabout some member of the family connection and remarks and
directions about their work formed the staple of their talk
Oh how did it come that you and Ned staid behind when all the rest
went to Viamede for the winter asked Ella
Business kept my husband and love for him and his society kept me
returned Zoe with a look and smile that altogether belied any suspicion
Ella might have had that she was fretting over the disappointment
Didnt you want to go
Yes indeed if Edward could have gone with me but any place with him
is better than any other without him
Well I dont believe I should have been willing to stay behind even
in your place Ive always had a longing to spend a winter there
visiting my sister Isa and my cousins Elsie and Molly Cal and Art say
perhaps one or both of them may go on to spend two or three weeks this
winter and in that case I shall go along
Perhaps we may go at the same time and what a nice party we will
make said Zoe There glancing from the window I see my husband
coming and I want to run out and speak to him Will you excuse me a
moment and scarcely waiting for a reply she ran gayly away
Meeting Edward on the threshold I have no lessons to recite this
time she said but you are not to scold because Ive been prevented
from studying by company Ella is spending the day with me
Ah I hope you have had a pleasant time togethernot too much troubled
by fear of a lecture from the old tyrant who bears your lessons he
said laughingly as he bent his head to press a kiss of ardent affection
upon the rosy lips she held up to him
No she laughed in return Im not a bit afraid of him
Zoe had feared the hours when Edward was unavoidably absent from her
side would be very lonely now while the other members of the Ion family
were away but she did not find it so her studies and the work of
making various pretty things for Christmas gifts keeping her very busy
And when he was with her time flew on very rapid wings She had grown
quite industrious and generally plied her needle in the evenings while
he read or talked to her But occasionally he would take the embroidery
or whatever it was out of her hands and toss it aside saying she was
trying her eyes by such constant use and besides he wanted her
undivided attention
And she would resign herself to her fate nothing loath to be drawn
close to his side or to a seat upon his knee to be petted and
caressed like a child which indeed he persisted in calling her
This was when they were alone but very frequently they had company to
spend the day afternoon or evening for Ion had always been noted for
its hospitality and scarcely a week passed in which they did not pay a
visit to the Oaks the Laurels the Pines or Roselands
Also a brisk correspondence was carried on with the absent members of
the family And Zoes housekeeping cares and duties were just enough to
be an agreeable variety in her occupations every day too when the
weather permitted she walked or rode out with her husband
And so the time passed quite delightfully for the first two months after
the departure of the Viamede party
It was a disappointment that Edward found himself too busy to make the
hopedfor trip to Viamede at Christmastime yet Zoe did not fret over
it and really enjoyed the holidays extremely giving and receiving
numerous handsome presents and with Edwards assistance making it a
merry and happy time for the servants and other dependants as well as
for the relatives and friends still in the neighborhood
The necessary shopping with Edward to help her and the packing
and sending off of the Christmasboxes to Viamede to the
collegeboysHerbert and Haroldand numerous other relatives and
friends far and near Zoe thought altogether the most delightful
business she had ever taken in hand
A very merry happy little woman she was through all those weeks and
months Edward as devoted as any lover and as gay and lighthearted as
herself
Zoe darling Edward said one day at dinner I must drive over into
our little village of Unionby the way do you know that we have more
than a hundred towns of that name in these United States
No I did not know or suspect that we had nearly so many she
interrupted laughing no wonder letters go astray when people are not
particular to give the names of both county and State But what were you
going to say about driving over there
I must see a gentleman on business who will be there to meet the
fiveoclock train and leave on it and in order to be certain of
seeing him I must be there at least fifteen or twenty minutes before it
is due Shall I have the pleasure of my wifes company in the carriage
I have ordered it to be at the door by fifteen or twenty minutes past
four which will give us plenty of time as it is an easy matter to
drive from here to Union in ten minutes
Thank you she said I accept the invitation with pleasure and
promise to be ready at the minute
You are the best little woman about that he returned with an
appreciative look and smile I dont remember that you have ever yet
kept me waiting when told beforehand at what time I intended to start
Of course not she said with a pleased laugh because I was afraid
if I did I shouldnt be invited so often and Im always so glad to go
with you
Not gladder than I am to have you he said with a very loverlike
glance and smile I always enjoy your society and am always proud to
show my friends and acquaintances what a dear little wife I have I dare
say Im looked upon as a very fortunate fellow in that respect and
sometimes envied on account of having drawn such a prize in the
matrimonial lottery
They had left the table while he spoke and with the last words he
passed his arm round her waist
Dear me Ned what a gallant speech she said flushing with delight
you deserve a reward and she held up her face for a kiss
I am overpaid he said when he had bestowed it
In spite of the coin being such as you have a right to help yourself
to whenever you will she returned with a merry laugh O Ned my
loverhusband she added laying her head on his breast I am so happy
in belonging to you and I can never love you enough for all your
goodness to me
Darling are you not equally good and loving to me he asked in tender
tones and holding her close
But I owe every thing to you she responded with emotion If you had
not come to my aid when my dear father was taken from me what would
have become of me a mere child without a near relative in the world
alone and destitute in a foreign land
But I loved you dearest I sought my own happiness as well as yours
in asking you to be my wife So you need never feel burdened by the idea
that you are under any special obligation to me to whom you are the
very sunshine of life
Dear Ned how very kind in you to say so she responded gazing with
ardent affection into his eyes but it isnt burdensome to be under
obligation to you any more than it is a trial to be ruled by you she
added with playful tenderness and I love to think of all your
goodness to me
It was five minutes past four by Zoes watch and she just about to go
to her dressingroom to put on her hat and cloak when visitors were
announcedsome ladies who always made a lengthened call at Ion so
she at once resigned herself to the loss of her anticipated drive with
her husband
O Ned she whispered in a hasty vexed aside youll have to go
alone
Yes dear he returned but Ill try to get back in time to take you
a drive in the other direction
They stepped forward and greeted their guests with hospitable
cordiality
They were friends whose visits were prized and enjoyed though their
coming just at this time was causing Zoe a real disappointment However
Edwards promise of a drive with him at a later hour so far made amends
for it that she could truthfully express pleasure in seeing her guests
Edward chatted with them for a few moments then excusing himself on
the plea of business that could not be deferred left them to be
entertained by Zoe while he entered his waiting carriage and went on
his way to the village where he expected to meet his business
acquaintance
CHAPTER II
The truth you speak doth lack some gentlenessSHAKSPEARE
Edward had met and held his desired interview with his business
acquaintance seen him aboard his train and was standing watching it as
it steamed away and disappeared in the distance when a feminine voice
close at hand suddenly accosted him
O Mr Travilla how are you I consider myself very fortunate in
finding you here
He turned toward the speaker and was not too greatly pleased at sight
of her
Ah goodevening Miss Deane he said taking her offered hand and
speaking with gentlemanly courtesy In what can I be of service to
you
By inviting me to Ion to spend the night she returned laughingly
Ive missed my train and was quite in despair at the thought of
staying alone over night in one of the miserable little hotels of this
miserable little village So I was delighted to see your carriage
standing there and you yourself beside it for knowing you to be one
of the most hospitable of men I am sure you will be moved to pity and
take me home with you
Edwards heart sank at thought of Zoe but seeing no way out of the
dilemma Certainly he said and helped his selfinvited guest to a
seat in his carriage placed himself by her side and bade the coachman
drive on to Ion
Now really this is very good in you Mr Travilla remarked Miss
Deane there is no place I like better to visit than Ion and I begin
to think it was rather a fortunate mishapmissing my train
Very unfortunate for me I fear sighed Edward to himself The loss
of her drive will be a great disappointment to Zoe and the sight of
such a guest far from making it up to her I am thankful the visit is to
be for only a night
Aloud he said I fear you will find it less pleasant than on former
occasionsin fact rather lonely as all the family are
absentspending the winter at Viamede my mothers Louisiana
plantationexcept my wife and myself
Ah but your wife is a charming little girlI never can think of her
as a woman you knowand you are a host in yourself returned the
lady laughingly
Zoes callers had left and she having donned hat and cloak not to
keep her husband a single moment was at the window watching for his
coming when the carriage came driving up the avenue and drew up at the
door
She hurried out expecting to find no one there but himself and to be
at once handed to a seat in the vehicle and the next minute be speeding
away with him enjoying her drive all the more for the little
disappointment that had preceded it
What then was her chagrin to see a visitor handed out and that
visitor the woman for whom she had conceived the most violent antipathy
Miss Deane my dear Edward said with an entreating look at Zoe
which she did not see her eyes being at that instant fixed upon the
face of her uninvited and unwelcome guest
How do you do my dear Mrs Travilla I hope you are glad to see me
laughed the intruder holding out a delicately gloved hand your
husband has played the Good Samaritan to me tonightsaving me from
having to stay in one of those wretched little hotels in the village
till two oclock tomorrow morning
I am in usual health thank you Will you walk in returned Zoe in a
freezing tone and utterly ignoring the offered hand Will you step
into the parlor or would you prefer being shown to your room first
The latter if you please Miss Deane answered sweetly apparently
quite unaware that Zoes manner was in the least ungracious
Dinah said Zoe to a maidinwaiting show Miss Deane to the room
she occupied on her last visit Carry up her satchel and see that she
has every thing she wants
Having given the order Zoe stepped out to the veranda where Edward
still was having staid behind to give directions in regard to the
horses
Zoe love I am very sorry he said as the man turned his horses
heads and drove away toward the stables
O Edward how could you she exclaimed reproachfully tears of
disappointment and vexation springing to her eyes
Darling I really could not help it he replied soothingly drawing
her to him with a caress and went on to tell exactly what had occurred
She is not a real lady said Zoe or she never would have done a
thing like that
I agree with you love he said but I was sorry your reception of
her was so extremely ungracious and cold
Would you have had me play the hypocrite Ned she asked indignantly
No Zoe I should be very far from approving of that he answered
gravely but while it was right and truthful not to express pleasure
which you did not feel at her coming you might on the other hand
have avoided absolute rudeness you might have shaken hands with her
and asked after her health and that of her fathers family
I treated her as well as she deserved and it does not make her any the
more welcome to me that she has already been the means of drawing down
upon me a reproof from my husbands lips Zoe said in tremulous tones
and turning away from him with her eyes full of tears
My words were hardly intended as that little wife Edward responded
in a kindly tone following her into the hall catching her in his arms
and imprinting a kiss on her ruby lips
And I wanted my drive with you so badly she murmured half hiding her
face on his breast but she has robbed us of that andO Ned is she
to come between us again and make us quarrel and be so dreadfully
unhappy Her voice was full of tears and sobs before she had ended
No no I could not endure that any more than you he said with
emotion and clasping her very close and it is only for tonight you
will have to bear the annoyance of her presence she is to leave in the
morning
Is she that is some comfort I hope somebody will come in for the
evening and share with us the infliction of her society Zoe said
concluding with a forlorn attempt at a laugh
Wont you take off that very becoming hat and cloak Mrs Travilla and
spend the evening asked Edward playfully
Thank you I believe I will if you will accompany me to the
dressingroom she returned with a smiling look up into his face
That I will with pleasure he said provided you will reward me with
some assistance with my toilet
Such as brushing your hair and tying your cravat Yes sir I will
its a bargain
And so laughing and chatting they went up to their own private
apartments
Halt an hour later they came down again together to find Miss Deane in
the parlor seated by a window overlooking the avenue
Theres a carriage just drawing up before your front entrance she
remarked the Roselands family carriage I think it is
Zoe gave her husband a bright pleased look It seemed her wish for an
addition to their party for the evening had been granted
The next moment the roomdoor was thrown open and Dr Conly and Miss
Ella were announced
They were cordially welcomed asked to tea and staid the evening
greatly relieving Zoe in the matter of entertaining her unwelcome guest
who devoted herself to the doctor and left Edward to his wife and
cousin a condition of things decidedly agreeable to Zoe
A little after nine the Roselands carriage was announced and the doctor
and Ella took their departure Edward and Zoe accompanying them to the
outer door
The sky was black with clouds and the wind roaring through the trees on
the lawn
We are going to have a heavy storm I think remarked Arthur glancing
upward there is not a star to be seen and the wind blows almost a
gale I hope no patient of mine will want the doctor very badly
tonight he added with a slight laugh Step in out of the wind
cousin Zoe or you may be the very one to send for me
Doing as directed No indeed she said Im sure I couldnt have the
heart to call anybody up out of a warm bed to face such a cutting wind
as this
No no never hesitate when there is a real necessity he returned
speaking from his seat in the carriage where he had already taken his
place beside his sister whom Edward had handed in Goodnight and
hurry in both of you for my sake if not for your own
But they lingered a moment till the carriage turned and drove swiftly
down the avenue
I am so glad they came remarked Zoe as Edward shut the door and
locked it for the night
Yes he said they added a good deal to the pleasure of the evening
As we couldnt be alone together three guests were more acceptable than
one
Decidedly and that one was delighted Im sure to have an opportunity
to exercise her conversational gifts for the benefit of a single man
instead of a married one
Zoe love dont allow yourself to grow bitter and sarcastic Edward
said turning toward her laying a hand lightly affectionately upon
her shoulder and gazing down into her eyes with a look of grave
concern
She colored under it and turned away with a pout that almost spoiled
the beauty of her fair face She was more than ever impatient to be rid
of their selfinvited guest
She always sets Ned to scolding me was the bitter thought in her
heart as she went slowly back to the parlor where they had left Miss
Deane Edward following sighing inwardly at the change in his darling
always wrought by that unwelcome presence in the house
How the wind roars down the chimney Miss Deane remarked as her host
and hostess reentered the room where she was comfortably seated in an
easychair beside the glowing grate I fear tomorrow will prove a
stormy day but in that case I shall feel all the more delighted with my
comfortable quarters hereall the more grateful to you Mr Travilla
for saving me from a long detention in one of those miserable little
country taverns where I should have died of ennui
You seem kindly disposed my dear madam to make a great deal of a
small service returned Edward gallantly
But Zoe said not a word She stood gazing into the fire apparently lost
in thought but the color deepened on her cheek and a slight frown
contracted her brows
Presently she turned to her guest saying courteously You must be
weary with your journey Miss Deane would you like to retire
Thank you I should was the reply and thereupon the goodnights were
said and they sought their respective rooms
You are not displeased with me dear Zoe asked lifting her eyes
inquiringly to her husbands face as she stood before their
dressingroom fire with his arm about her waist you are looking so
very grave
No dearest I am not disposed to find fault with you he said softly
caressing her hair and cheek with his disengaged hand though I should
be glad if you could be a trifle more cordial to our uninvited guest
Its my nature to act just as I feel and if theres a creature on
earth I thoroughly detest it is she returned the childwife with
almost passionate vehemence I know she hates mefor all her purring
manner and sweet tones and wordsand that she likes nothing better
than to make trouble between my husband and me
My dear child you really must try not to be so uncharitable and
suspicious Edward said in a slightly reproving tone I do not
perceive any such designs or any hypocrisy in her conduct toward you
No men are as blind as a bat in their intercourse with such women
never can see through their designs always take them to be as sweet and
amiable as they pretend to be It takes a woman to understand her own
sex
Maybe so he said soothingly but we will leave the disagreeable
subject for tonight at least shall we not
Yes and oh I do hope the weather tomorrow will not be such as to
afford her an excuse for prolonging her stay
I hope not indeed love he responded but let us resolve that if
it does we will try to bear the infliction patiently and give our
selfinvited guest no right to accuse us of a lack of hospitality toward
her Let us not forget or disobey the Bible injunction to use
hospitality one to another without grudging
Ill try not to Ill be as good to her as I can without feeling that
I am acting insincerely
And that is all I ask love Your perfect freedom from any thing
approaching to deceit is one of your greatest charms in your husbands
eyes he said tenderly caressing her It would I am sure be quite
impossible for me to love a wife in whose absolute truth and sincerity I
had not entire confidence
And you do love me your foolish faulty little wife she said in a
tone that was a mixture of assertion and inquiry while her lovely eyes
gazed searchingly into his
Dearly dearly my sweet he said smiling fondly down upon her And
now to bed lest these bright eyes and rosy cheeks should lose something
of their brilliance and beauty
Suppose they should she said turning slightly pale as with sudden
pain O Ned if I live I must some day grow old and gray and wrinkled
my eyes dim and sunken shall you love me then darling
Better than ever love he whispered holding her closer to his heart
for how long we shall have lived and loved together We shall have come
to be as one indeed each with hardly a thought or feeling unshared by
the other
CHAPTER III
One woman reads anothers character without the tedious trouble of
decipheringJONSON
Zoes sleep that night was profound and refreshing and she woke in
perfect health and vigor of body and mind but the first sound that
smote upon her earthe dashing of sleet against the windowpanesent
a pang of disappointment and dismay to her heart
She sprang from her bed and running to the window drew aside the
curtain and looked out
O Ned she groaned the ground is covered with sleet and snowabout
a foot deep I should thinkand just hear how the wind shrieks and
howls round the house
Well love he answered in a cheery tone we are well sheltered and
supplied with all needful things for comfort and enjoyment
And one that will destroy every bit of my enjoyment in any or all the
others she sighed but eagerly and half hopefully do you think it
is quite certain to be too bad for her to go
Quite I am afraid If she should offer to go he added mischievously
we will not be more urgent against it than politeness demands and if
she persists will not refuse the use of the close carriage as far as
the depot
She offer to go exclaimed Zoe scornfully you may depend shell
stay as long as she has the least vestige of an excuse for doing so
Oh now little woman dont begin the day with being quite so hard and
uncharitable Edward said half seriously half laughingly
Zoe was not far wrong in her estimate of her guest Miss Deane was both
insincere and a thoroughly selfish person caring nothing for the
comfort or happiness of others She had perceived Zoes antipathy from
the first day of their acquaintance and took a revengeful malicious
delight in tormenting her and she had sufficient penetration to see
that the most effectual way to accomplish her end was through Edward
The young wifes ardent and jealous affection for her husband was very
evident plainly it was pain to her to see him show Miss Deane the
slightest attention or seem interested in any thing she did or said
therefore the intruder put forth every effort to interest him and
monopolize his attention and at the same time contrived to draw out
into exhibition the most unamiable traits in Zoes character doing it
so adroitly that Edward did not perceive her agency in the matter and
thought Zoe alone to blame To him Miss Deanes behavior appeared
unexceptionable her manner most polite and courteous Zoes just the
reverse
It was so through all that day and week for the storm continued and
the uninvited guest never so much as hinted at a wish to leave the
shelter of their hospitable roof
Zoe began each day with heroic resolve to be patient and forbearing
sweettempered and polite toward her tormentor and ended it with a
deep sense of humiliating failure and of having lost something of the
high esteem and admiration in which her almost idolized husband had been
wont to hold her
Feeling that more or less of change in her manner toward him was
inevitable less sure than formerly of his entire approval and ardent
affection a certain timidity and hesitation crept into her manner of
approaching him even when they were quite alone together she grew sad
silent and reserved and he thinking her sullen and jealous without
