VOL XLII  JULY 1888  No 7
American Missionary Association
It gives us great pleasure to announce that at a recent meeting of
our Executive Committee Rev Wm M Taylor DD Pastor of the
Broadway Tabernacle New York was elected President of the American
Missionary Association
The death of our late honored President exGovernor Washburn
occurred so short a time before our last Annual Meeting that no
attempt was there made to elect his successor but the matter was
referred according to the Constitution to the Executive Committee
After mature deliberation and with great unanimity Dr Taylor was
elected A brief extract from his letter accepting the position will
indicate his sympathy with our work and his heartiness in
cooperating with us in this new relation
Your Association alike by its history in the past and its work in
the present has a strong hold on my heart It is doing a work much
needed one too which is intimately connected with the welfare of
the nation as well as with the future of the races among whom it
specially labors It has always been a joy to me to plead for it with
my people from my pulpit and I regard your selection of me as your
President as one of the highest honors of my life
We are glad to be able to mention also the election of Mr Charles
A Hull as a member of our Executive Committee in place of the
honored and respected AS Barnes deceased Mr Hull was formerly a
member of the committee but was compelled to retire on account of
pressure of business He now returns to his place cheerfully and to
our great satisfaction
Who reads Missionary MagazinesWe are glad to know that THE
AMERICAN MISSIONARY has appreciative readers with quick eyes From the
last numbers we have noticed extracts and quotations in the New York
Observer the Religious Herald the Advance the New York
Tribune and the New York Times We are more than willing

THE INDIAN PROBLEM
A good deal of ingenious ciphering has been done in endeavoring to
solve this problem and withal there has been a good deal of honest
and efficient work The Government has largely increased its
appropriations from year to year the Dawes Bill and other valuable
legislation have been secured so that steps looking towards the
citizenship of the Indian have been attained Appropriations have been
granted to aid him in farming and other industrial pursuits and it is
not unlikely that in a short time provision will be made for the
education in the common English branches of every Indian child
But all this is not sufficient The Indian may have lands and
citizenship and an English education and yet if he has no strong
impulse towards civilization no motive in his heart impelling him to
be an industrious selfsupporting citizenin short if he has not a
new heart looking to a new life as a citizen and a man he will become
a vagabond on the land granted him and a skeptic in the school in
which he is taught The next few years will constitute a crisis in the
rapidly changing condition of the Indian and it is precisely at this
point where the vital element of the Christian life must be infused
into his character To the Christian public all other questions
subordinate themselves to this and this needs not speculation but
hard work legislation cannot do it the church must time will not do
it Christian teaching and example alone can The vernacular question
so much agitated recently is important only as it may hinder this
practical work
The Indian problem is not perpetual The Indian must soon be merged
into the American and whether this shall be for good or for ill the
church must decide and decide speedily We trust therefore that our
constituents will aid us to extend as rapidly as possible that part
of the work entrusted to us We do not ask for expensive buildings or
costly plant We ask for the means to push forward with the teacher
and the preacher among these uncivilized people till when they come
forth from their present anomalous condition they shall come forth
practical Christians as well as intelligent and industrious citizens
AN OUTRAGE
Prof GW Lawrence teacher of our school at Jellico Tenn a
gentleman of quiet and unobtrusive manners was brutally assaulted by
a man of that place and was shot in three places one ball entered
the wrist and followed up the arm coming out near the shoulder a
second went into the back of the shoulder and a third is probably
lodged in the lungs The assault occurred May 18th in the church in
which Mr Lawrence was holding the school in the presence of his wife
and scholars The only provocation pg 197 alleged was that he had
gone the night before to ask for the tuition of one of his scholars
He was met in an angry way by the woman and the next day the husband
who does not live with his wife came to the school and fired the
shots Prof Lawrence is the brotherinlaw of our highly esteemed and
active Christian worker Rev AA Myers who has not only done so
much in promoting school and church work in Kentucky and Tennessee
but who has also been so zealous in promoting the cause of temperance
Prof Lawrence sympathized and cooperated with Mr Myers in this good
work and it is believed that liquor and liquor influence had much to
do in inspiring the deed As all the parties in this transaction were
white it is not at all probable that the colorline question had
anything to do with it
The community was moved with intense indignation and the assassin was
speedily taken to the county jail to escape a lynching A large
meeting was subsequently held in the Baptist Church and a committee
was appointed to prosecute the perpetrator Mr Lawrence at this
writing is in a very critical condition but hopes are entertained of
his ultimate recovery
WADE HAMPTON
We opened the June number of the Forum with the confident
expectation that the article on What Negro Supremacy Means by
Senator Wade Hampton would furnish some wellconsidered and
statesmanlike views on that important topic We expected to find a
fair if not an encouraging statement of the changes that twenty
years have wrought in the educational and property qualifications of
the Negro But we confess our utter disappointment in finding that
Senator Wade devotes his entire article to details of the Acts of the
South Carolina Legislature from 1868 to 1876 in other words to the
reconstruction or carpetbag period He adds it is true a quotation
from an address of Abraham Lincoln but that dates back into the still
remoter past 1859 Mr Lincoln learned something better before he
died
We make no defence of that carpetbag Legislature but does not
Senator Wade recognize the change that has taken place in the
condition of the Negroa change that is going on at an increased
ratio Would an article be worth much on What AngloSaxon Supremacy
Means based on extracts from Roman histories in regard to the
ancient Germans True the comparison is an extreme one but it must
be remembered that more progress is now made in human civilization
in one year than in a century then But let us confine ourselves
to the facts as they now stand The present generation of Negroes
in the South has had the aid of the public schools limited and
inadequate as they are and it has had the still more valuable aid
of schools sustained by Northern benevolence supplemented in some
cases pg 198 by aid from the Southern States that have furnished
instruction of the best quality in all ranges of study from primary
to college and professional From Hampton Va to Austin Texas
these schools supported by various religious denominations with
carefully selected and thoroughly competent teachers from the North
have been sending forth their graduates as teachers preachers
professional and business men These schools of all grades number more
than two hundred and a large per cent of their graduates become
teachers who are giving a mighty uplift to their people A colored
editor could say truthfully two years ago We have preachers learned
and eloquent we have professors in colleges by hundreds and
schoolmasters by thousands successful farmers merchants ministers
lawyers editors educators and physicians To all this it may be
added that careful estimates place the amount of property on which the
Negroes in the Southern States pay taxes at one hundred millions of
dollars Surely this race could now furnish legislators more
intelligent and more interested in the assessment of taxes than in
1868 and the number and quality will be rapidly increased every year
Senator Hampton might have looked around and ahead and not backward
only His article as it stands stamps him as a veritable Bourbon
he has forgotten nothing and he has learned nothing
MR CABLES PAMPHLET
A COLORED MANS VIEW OF IT
Mr Cables Pamphlet The Negro Question was sent to an
educated Christian colored man in the South We make some
brief extracts from his letter acknowledging the receipt of
the pamphlet He says
I have read The Negro Question by Geo W Cable and appreciate
it highly It is the ablest treatment of the subject intellectually
morally and judicially that I ever saw Mr Cable has dealt with that
great question with the insight of a statesman and a thinker and
the candor of a true Christian Oh how I am vexed and do smart when I
think of the wicked treatment I and my people are subjected to on
account of the Godgiven color and by a people claiming and
professing to be Christians I can hardly believe that any other
people ever bore the names freemen and citizens and at the same time
were shut out from so many of their rights and liberties as we are
Our manhood is outraged our civil and political rights are abused
our women are robbed of their womanhood and their chastity is
insulted our aspirations are banded and proscription is held up to
our eyes wherever we go and enforced against us with Egyptian
exactness and Spartan severity and the most vexatious and grievous
fact of all is that the strong arm of the law of the land loses its
power when it comes our turn to receive justice The law either plays
truant or openly acknowledges that it has no power to defend us But
the God of law and pg 199 justice who broke down one form of
slavery will break down this too Still there is a part for us to
do On this line as on others the man who needs help must help
himself while he asks for help
MRS WARE
We honor the memory of the early and selfdenying workers
among the Freedmen They were ostracised at the South and
were scarcely appreciated at the North Many of them have laid
down their lives in the service others were compelled to
return home on account of illhealth but others still are
toiling on seeing the fruits of their labors in the new
impulse given to the Negro in his great race struggle Among
the earliest and most efficient of these workers was President
Ware of Atlanta now gone to his reward Mrs Ware is still
at the post of duty and though in feeble health clings with
undiminished interest to her chosen lifework
At the recent anniversary of the Atlanta University the
meeting of the Alumni May 28th was made pleasant and
memorable by the presentation to Mrs Ware of a large portrait
of herself It was wholly unexpected to her and her impromptu
acknowledgment of the gift was made in the vein of her
characteristic vivacity and kindness Among the addresses made
at the presentation was one by Mrs Chase herself one of our
earliest and most honored laborers From this address we are
permitted to make a few extracts
It is very significant that at any time during these twenty years of
your life here it would have been just as delightful to meet and say
the pleasant words that leap to our lips as it is to say them today
You whom we delight to honor this afternoon have held the same post
of honor all these years but many of us do not know how delightfully
you hold that place so I who have known you so long am asked to
explain and if this hasty sketch seems too flattering to be given in
your presence I fear you alone are responsible If you had put less
into your life for us to admire we could put less into our expression
of admiration
We know how you lost early a good mother and that your father was
taken when you were only eighteen but the missionary spirit of that
father was repeated in the daughter We know of your being discouraged
by a missionary Board because applying so young but of your being
finally accepted and going to Hampton reaching that now famous
school even before the veteranGeneral Armstrong
Then came the year of teaching at Charleston a year so full of
privations in those pioneer days that though repeated calls came to
you from Florida and Georgia as well as the old fields you shrank
from farther hardships and decided to remain at home till one Sunday
morning in Connecticut twenty years ago these words were unfolded in
a sermon Simon Son of Jonas lovest thou me Yea Lord thou
knowest that I love thee He saith unto him Feed my Lambs How easy
it is for us now to see the beautiful Providence of those wonderful
words finding a swift response in your heart and bringing you at once
to Atlanta There are those before me now that greeted you then in
Storrs School How pg 200 much we might say of that eventful year
when you worked beyond your strength to fit the A class for Atlanta
University We can hardly see how it could have been otherwise than
that the next year you should come to us the bride of our beloved
President But position brought no exemption from hard work to either
of you royal workers
We shall never forget what hosts of friends have been won for the
school by your ready pen and stirring words And during those sixteen
memorable foundation years of our school which are so rapidly passing
into history who can ever know how much of their grand success was
due to you for your devotion to him who created Atlanta University
and made it what it is We may know in that day when He makes up his
jewels
THREE COMMENCEMENTS
BY A VISITOR
It has been my privilege to attend in succession the anniversary
exercises at Hampton Va Atlanta Ga and Howard University
Washington DC Hampton as usual welcomed a crowd of visitors and
among these a number of distinguished menGovernor Lee of Virginia
and Senator Dawes being those most widely known The visitor sees
here the magical touch of genius in these large and commodious
buildings the schools the shops the houses the cottages and
crowning all the stately chapel The plat of the village in which
these are congregated realizes the words
A mighty maze and not without a plan
The effect of the whole threaded by winding roads shaded by trees
and interspersed with gardens and shrubs is picturesque and
practically convenient The main value of Hampton however is found
in what is done within these buildingsthe teaching the
industries the making of character
The graduating exercises were the great attraction The addresses and
papers of the pupils did not perhaps as a whole quite come up to
what we have heard in other years but all were good and some of them
of great excellence One is always impressed at Hampton with the tone
and local coloring of the addresses They are tinged and touched by
the work done here and the races for and by whom it is done The
titles of some of the pieces show this What is expected of a Hampton
Graduate Hampton Girls Mission Work in Tennessee Way down in
Georgia Progress of the Oneidas Of the same sort was the closing
tableau The Great Father and his Children a representation by
Indian students with the implements or products of the industries
they have learned applying to the Great Father for admission to his
country The exercises were closed by eloquent addresses given by
Rev Dr Parkhurst of New York one of the Trustees Governor Lee of
Virginia and Senator Dawes
pg 201
Atlanta University now welcomes its visitors to its
beautiful green lawns and fields which were once red clay washed into
deep gullies The buildings are convenient and wellkept The
Baccalaureate sermon delivered by Professor Francis was very
appropriate and touching The commencement exercises were held on
Monday May 28th and were attended by a vast concourse of people
many going away because the building though large could not give
them room The aisles were crowded through all the services The
audiences were as usual made up mostly of colored people
Heretofore at times the dignitaries of the State and city have
graced the platform but Governor Gordon was out of town and
perhaps if he had been at home he would not have attended The
recent excitement about the Glenn Bill and the withdrawal of the
8000 the annual grant of the State have left the relations
somewhat strained There is however no excitement on that subject
The State authorities have not yet decided what to do with the fund
and in the meantime the University goes quietly forward with its
work Prof Bumstead has just succeeded in raising the 16000
necessary to meet the current expenses of the year
At the anniversary exercises there were no graduates from the college
department this year Thirteen pupils all girls from the normal
department read their essays and received their certificates of
graduation The number of the class is supposed to be unfortunate
but there was nothing amiss in the quality of the essays they read
They were all good but the absence of any male voice left the class
somewhat in the condition of a choir without a baas There was a
noticeable difference in one respect between the essays on this
occasion and those at Hampton Here there was no local or race
tone If I had closed my eyes I might have thought myself at the
anniversary of a Ladies Seminary at the North Scarcely a word or
allusion indicated that these girls belonged to the colored race and
for that matter their faces scarcely showed it for the white blood
largely preponderated in most of them I can well understand why these
pupils should prefer to stand forth not as a distinct race but as
American and Christian girls Perhaps that is the higher wisdom but
it makes the anniversary less distinctive and inspires less sympathy
and enthusiasm These girls were plainly dressed and in that respect
would differ greatly from the graduating class in a Northern Female
Seminary but they would have no occasion to shrink from a comparison
with their Northern sisters if propriety of deportment and
excellence and force of writing were considered
At the Howard University we had the opportunity of attending only the
exercises of the graduating class in college This institution has a
good claim to its title as a University for it has collegiate
medical theological law and normal departments The anniversaries of
the theological and medical departments had been held a few days
previously in pg 202 churches down in the city and were attended
as we understand by large audiences The college anniversary on the
other hand was held in the college chapel which while it was well
filled contained a relatively small audience and this was made up
mostly of colored people We hardly appreciate this discrimination as
to the places of holding these anniversaries for the orations in the
chapel were of a high order and might well have attracted the
attention of members of Congress and of the numerous visitors in the
crowded city The graduating class consisted of six persons one being
a lady and she the only one of the class without apparent admixture of
white blood The addresses were all orations and resembled somewhat
the essays in the Atlanta school in presenting almost no touch or
tone of race or local surroundings the ladys being almost the
only exception I could not avoid the conviction that if these
welltrained minds had thrown themselves into topics more nearly
related to their own life and race struggle there would have been
more fervor in the oratory But some of these graduates will yet be
heard from as useful laborers in some fields of active Christian work
THE SOUTH
NOTES IN THE SADDLE
BY REV CJ RYDER DISTRICT SECRETARY
I promised in my February Notes in the Saddle to give a brief
account of the mountain campaign which had then just closed It was
full of most interesting experiences We began the series of meetings
in the Congregational Church Jellico Tenn The Association was
represented by one of its Corresponding Secretaries a District
Secretary and the writer Beside these brethren from abroad the
local force of AMA workers was large and several neighboring
churches of our Congregational faith sent their pastors
At Jellico the AMA has planted both a church and a school and
built a meeting house The interesting series of meetings which began
at Jellico was for the purpose of dedicating the neat Congregational
churches recently built by the Association along this line of
railroad Preaching services were held every afternoon and evening
the company of ministers taking turns as they pushed on from one
church to another These churches are at Jellico Pleasant View
South Williamsburg Williamsburg Woodbine Rockhold and Corbin
Congregationalism through the AMA has taken possession of this
whole region in the name of Christ We can easily hold it in the
interests of broad and evangelical Christianity if our older
Congregational churches in the East and North arouse themselves to
meet the pressing exigencies and realize the splendid pg 203
possibilities that lie before them in this field today but which
will be denied them in the near future
One very interesting feature of these meetings was the dedication of
a chapel which has been recently added to the Williamsburg church
and which is used for the infant class of the Sundayschool This
class had outgrown all the accommodations of the church in connection
with the other departments of the Sundayschool It had become a
Sundayschool of itself This chapel was therefore built and
publicly set aside for the service of these little folks
During these meetings our honored Corresponding Secretary and
District Secretary pushed through the storms and forded mountain
streams together with the other brethren that they might keep the
appointments which had been made for them Dr Roys stereopticon
views which have interested and instructed so many audiences in the
North he used with great profit during this mountain campaign
Two men called upon Brother Myers our general missionary in this
mountain region and requested that he and the writer visit the field
some fourteen miles away from which they had come that morning They
told a thrillingly interesting story of how Gods Spirit had entered
their hearts and stirred them up to desire better things for their
children and their community than they had enjoyed One of them was a
son of a French Catholic mother and had early adopted her faith His
life had been wild and reckless until he found the Saviour in a
meeting led by an AMA missionary He was an intelligent man of some
education He found others ready to join him in a movement for the
elevation of the people They established a church and organized a
Sundayschool We pushed over the mountain on horseback after the
other visiting brethren had left the mountain region to inspect
personally this field We found it even as the men had represented it
to be A little church had been organized and Sundayschool gathered
I could learn of no other Sundayschool in that region I heard
afterwards that one of the oldtime preachers warned the people
against the Sundayschool saying It war a heap worse than a dancing
place This same preacher had a vision and gave an account of it to
his people Two devils he said had been in that country getting
up some sort of an institution that they called a church He warned
his people against them
The two men who visited us at Jellico together with others who had
joined with them in this effort to Christianize and educate this
community we found busy on a hillside laying the foundations of the
new church house They were enthusiastic in this new movement which
promised so much to their community They had drawn up a confession of
faith and covenant which were evangelical and Congregational They
reported pg 204 three thousand people living in the coves and
valleys radiating from the point upon which they had planted their
church house absolutely without intelligent Christian instruction
of any kind There were hundreds of square miles without a church
building of any denomination This little company had been stirred up
by Gods Spirit and were almost starving for spiritual food There
was a pathos even in their peculiar mountain vernacular as one of
them said to me I dont understand scarcely a word you uns say Im
too old to larn now Ise done left But I does want my chilluns to
know somethin I tell you Id sell my old farm down in the cove sos
to help my chilluns to know somethin What a tremendous appeal this
is from the very heart of our country All they asked was one hundred
dollars to help them build this Congregational church house by the
side of Hickory Creek
While writing these Notes there comes flashing over the wires
the news of this horrible crime committed upon the person of Prof
GW Lawrence at Jellico I remember a conversation I had with Mr
Lawrence during this campaign of which I have been writing He had
just been offered an important and lucrative position as teacher in
the North He was a young man of only limited means and felt almost
that he must go I told him we could not offer him financial
inducements to remain but it seemed to me that the Lord had called
him to that work and I did not know where we could find a man to fill
his place Very well he replied I will remain The Christian
hero that he was he went patiently forward in this selfsacrificing
labor Now he has fallen by the hand of a brutal assassin This awful
crime emphasizes the importance of this work and calls aloud to us to
send more Christian missionaries into this field until Christian
light shall displace the darkness of semibarbarism
Turning a moment from the field in which our missions are planted
to that from which they are supported I give three interesting
incidents In a New England church two young girls came forward after
hearing the story of the AMA work in the dark places of our
country and pledged fourteen dollars which they had themselves
gathered by the sale of articles which they had made A good example
Another little girl not ten years old had one dollar which she had
been saving for sometime It was her total bank credit When she heard
of our pressing needs she slipped her dollar into my hand asking
that it be spent for the poor children in our field
A woman for years an AMA teacher but now a bedridden invalid
pledges 100 to the work of the Association What can we not do when
there is so much of Christian selfsacrifice in both departments of
our field

WILMINGTON NC
Our anniversary really began May 18 for on the evening of that date
