THE STORY OF THE GUIDES
CHAPTER I
FIRST STEPS IN WAR
It is given to some regiments to spread their achievements over the
quiet centuries while to the lot of others it falls to live for a
generation or two in an atmosphere of warlike strife and ever present
danger The Guides have been from a soldiers point of view somewhat
fortunate in seeing much service during the past sixty years and thus
their history lends itself readily to a narrative which is full of
adventure and stirring deeds The story of those deeds may perchance
be found of interest to those at home who like to read the gallant
record of the men who fight their battles in remote and unfamiliar
corners of the Empire across the seas
To Sir Henry Lawrence the preux chevalier who died a soldiers death
in the hallowed precincts of Lucknow the Guides owe their name and
origin At a time when soldiers fought and marched and lived in tight
scarlet tunics high stocks trousers tightly strapped over Wellington
boots and shakos which would now be looked on as certain death Sir
Henry evolved the startling heresy that to get the best work out of
troops and to enable them to undertake great exertions it was
necessary that the soldier should be loosely comfortably and suitably
clad that something more substantial than a pillbox with a
pockethandkerchief wrapped round it was required as a protection from a
tropical sun and that footgear must be made for marching and not for
parading round a bandstand
Martinets of the old school gravely shook their heads and trembled for
the discipline of men without stocks and overalls Men of the Irregular
Cavalry almost as much trussed and padded as their Regular comrades
who were often so tightly clad as to be unable to mount without
assistance looked with goodnatured tolerance on a foredoomed failure
But Sir Henry Lawrence had the courage of his opinions and determined
to put his theories to practice though at first on a small scale
Not only were the Guides to be sensibly clothed but professionally also
they were to mark a new departure In 1846 the Punjab was still a Sikh
province and the administration was only thinly strengthened by a
sprinkling of British officers Men half soldiers half civilians and
known in India under the curious misnomer of Political Officersa
class to whom the British Empire owes an overwhelming debtwere
scattered here and there hundreds of miles apart and in the name of
the Sikh Durbar practically ruled and administered provinces as large as
Ireland or Scotland The only British troops in the country were a few
of the Companys regiments quartered at Lahore to support the authority
of the Residenta mere coral island in the wide expanse What Sir
Henry Lawrence felt was the want of a thoroughly mobile body of troops
both horse and foot untrammelled by tradition ready to move at a
moments notice and composed of men of undoubted loyalty and devotion
troops who would not only be of value in the rough and tumble of a
soldiers trade but would grow used to the finer arts of providing
skilled intelligence
The title selected for the corps was in itself a new departure in the
British Army and history is not clear as to whether its preordained
duties suggested the designation to Sir Henry Lawrence or whether in
some back memory its distinguished predecessor in the French army stood
sponsor for the idea Readers of the Napoleonic wars will remember that
after the battle of Borghetto the Great Captain raised a Corps des
Guides and that this was the first inception of the Corps dElite
which later grew into the Consular Guard and later still expanded into
the worldfamed Imperial Guard ten thousand strong
But whatever the history of the inception of its title the duties of
the Corps of Guides were clearly and concisely defined in accordance
with Sir Henrys precepts It was to contain trustworthy men who
could at a moments notice act as guides to troops in the field men
capable too of collecting trustworthy intelligence beyond as well as
within our borders and in addition to all this men ready to give
and take hard blows whether on the frontier or in a wider field A
special rate of pay was accorded to all ranks And finally fortunate as
Sir Henry Lawrence had been in the inspiration that led him to advocate
this new departure he was no less fortunate in his selection of the
officer who was destined to inaugurate a new feature in the fighting
forces of the Empire
Even from among officers of proved experience and ability it is by no
means easy to select the right man to inaugurate and carry through
successfully an experimental measure much more difficult is it to do so
when the selection lies among young officers who have still to win their
spurs Yet from among old or young experienced or inexperienced it
would have been impossible to have selected an officer with higher
qualifications for the work in hand than the young man on whom the
choice fell
Born of a soldier stock and already experienced in war Harry Lumsden
possessed all the finest attributes of the young British officer He was
a man of strong character athletic brave resolute cool and
resourceful in emergency a man of rare ability and natural aptitude for
war and possessed moreover of that magnetic influence which
communicates the highest confidence and devotion to those who follow
In addition he was a genial comrade a keen sportsman and a rare friend
to all who knew him Such then was the young officer selected by Sir
Henry Lawrence to raise the Corps of Guides
That the commencement should be not too ambitious it was ruled that the
first nucleus should consist only of one troop of cavalry and two
companies of infantry with only one British officer But as this story
will show as time and success hallowed its standards this modest squad
expanded into the corps which now with twentyseven British officers
and fourteen hundred men holds an honoured place in the ranks of the
Indian Army
Following out the principle that the corps was to be for service and not
for show the timehonoured scarlet of the British Army was laid aside
for the dustcoloured uniform which half a century later under the now
wellknown name of khaki became the fighting dress of the whole of
the land forces of the Empire
The spot chosen for raising the new corps was Peshawur then the extreme
outpost of the British position in India situated in the land of men
born and bred to the fighting trade freelances ready to take service
wherever the rewards and spoils of war were to be secured While fully
appreciating the benefits of accurate drill and the minute attention to
technical detail bequeathed as a legacy by the school of Wellington
Lumsden upheld the principle that the greatest and best school for war
is war itself He believed in the elasticity which begets individual
selfconfidence and preferred a body of men taught to act and fight
with personal intelligence to the highlytrained impersonality which
requires a sergeants order before performing the smallest duty and an
officers fostering care to forestall its every need
Holding such views it is with no surprise we read that while his men
were still under the elementary training of drill instructors borrowed
from other regiments Lumsden led them forth to learn the art of war
under the blunt and rugged conditions of the Indian frontier To march
not through peaceful lanes but with all the care and precautions which
a semihostile region necessitated to encamp not on the quiet village
green where sentrygo might appear an unmeaning farce but in close
contact with a vigilant and active race of hard fighters especially
skilled in the arts of surprises and nightattacks to be ready always
ready with the readiness of those who meet difficulties half waysuch
were the precepts which the hardy recruits of the Guides imbibed
simultaneously with the automatic instruction of the drillsergeant
Nor was it long before Lumsden had an opportunity of practically
demonstrating to the young idea his methods of making war The corps
barely seven months old was encamped at Kalu Khan in the plain of
Yusafzai when sudden orders came directing it to make a nightmarch
with the object of surprising and capturing the village of Mughdara in
the Panjtar Hills In support of the small band of Guides was sent a
troop of Sikh cavalry seasoned warriors to stiffen the young endeavour
and hearten the infant warrior Marching all night half an hour before
daylight the force arrived at the mouth of a narrow defile
threefourths of a mile long leading to the village and along which
only one horseman could advance at a time Nothing dismayed and led by
the intrepid Lumsden in single file the Guides dashed at full gallop
through the defile fell with fury on the awakening village captured
and disarmed it and brought away as trophies of war its chief and
three hundred head of cattle To add to the modest pride taken in this
bright initial feat of arms it was achieved singlehanded for the
supporting troop of Sikhs failed to face the dark terrors of the defile
and remained behind This opening skirmish was the keynote to many an
after success It helped to foster a spirit of alert preparedness
readiness to seize the fleeting opportunity and courage and
determination when once committed to action These seeds thus planted
grew to be some of the acknowledged attributes of the force as it
blossomed into maturity under its gallant leader
During the first year of its existence the young corps was engaged in
several more of the same class of enterprise and in all acquitted
itself with quiet distinction As however the history of one is in
most particulars that of another it will not be necessary to enter into
a detailed account of each
The British in the Peshawur Valley as elsewhere in the Punjab were in
a somewhat peculiar position They were not administering or policing
the country on behalf of the British Government but in the name of the
Sikh Durbar In the Peshawur Valley in which broad term may be included
the plains of Yusafzai the Sikh rule was but feebly maintained amidst a
warlike race of an antagonistic faith In the matter of the collection
of revenue therefore the ordinary machinery of government was not
sufficiently strong to effect regular and punctual payment and
consequently when any village or district was much in arrears it
became customary to send a body of troops to collect the revenue If the
case was merely one of dilatoriness unaccompanied by hostile intent
the case was sufficiently met by the payment of the arrears due and by
bearing the cost of feeding the troops while the money was being
collected But more often dealing as they were with a weak and
discredited government the hardy warriors of the frontier sending
their wives and cattle to some safe glen in the distant hills openly
defied both the taxcollector and the troops that followed him It then
became a case either of coercion or of leaving it alone An effete
administration like that of the Sikhs if thus roughly faced as often
as not let the matter rest But with the infusion of British blood a
new era commenced and the principle was insisted on that where revenue
was due the villagers must pay or fight And further if they chose the
latter alternative a heavy extra penalty would fall on them such as
the confiscation of their cattle the destruction of their strongholds
and the losses inevitable when the appeal is made to warlike
arbitration
It was on such an expedition that one of the Guides had a curious and
fatal adventure Colonel George Lawrence who was the British
Representative in Peshawur was out in Yusafzai with a brigade of Sikh
troops collecting revenue and generally asserting the rights of
government Cooperating with him was Lumsden with the Guides Among the
recalcitrants was the village of Babuzai situated in a strong position
in the Lundkwar Valley and Lawrence determined promptly to coerce it
His plan of operation was to send the Guides infantry by night to work
along the hills so that before daylight they would be occupying the
commanding heights behind the village and thus cut off escape into the
mountains He himself at dawn would be in position with the Sikh
brigade to attack from the open plain while the Guides cavalry were
disposed so as to cut off the retreat to the right up the valley
In pursuance of their portion of the plan of operations as the Guides
infantry were cautiously moving along the hills towards their allotted
position in the growing light they suddenly came upon a picquet of the
enemy placed to guard against this very contingency To fire was to give
the alarm so with exceeding promptness the picquet was charged with the
bayonet and overpowered At the head of the small storming party
charged a duffadar1 of the Guides cavalry by name Fatteh Khan
Fatteh Khan was one of those men to whom it was as the breath of life to
be in every brawl and fight within a reasonable ride On this occasion
he was of opinion that the cavalry would see little or no fighting
whereas the infantry might well be in for a pretty piece of handtohand
work To what purpose therefore Sahib should I waste my day he said
to Lumsden With your Honours permission I will accompany my infantry
comrades on foot Are we not all of one corps And so he went keeping
well forward and handy for the first encounter
1 Duffadar a native noncommissioned officer of cavalry
answering to the naik corporal of infantry
As the gallant duffadar sword in hand dashed at the picquet he was
from a side position shot through both arms but not a whit dismayed or
hindered he hurled himself with splendid courage at the most brawny
opponent he could single out A short sharp conflict ensued Fatteh Khan
with his disabled arm using his sword while his opponent with an
Affghan knife in one hand was busy trying to induce the glow on his
matchlock to brighten up that the gun might definitely settle the
issue In the course of the skirmishing between the two men a curious
accident however occurred The tribesman as was usual in those days
was carrying under his arm a goatskin bag full of powder for future
use In aiming a blow at him Fatteh Khan missed his man but cut a hole
in the bag the powder began to run out and as ill chance would have
it some fell on the glowing ember of the matchlock This weapon
pointed anywhere and anyhow at the moment went off with a terrific
report which was followed instantaneously by a still greater explosion
The flame had caught the bag of powder and both the gallant duffadar
and his staunch opponent were blown to pieces
So died a brave soldier But lest the noise should have betrayed them
his comrades hurried on with increased eagerness and as good fortune
would have it arrived in position at the very nick of time The
operation was completely successful In due course the Sikhs attacked in
front and when the enemy tried to escape up the hills behind their
village they found retreat cut off by the Guides infantry Turning
back they essayed to break away to the right but the intention being
signalled to the Guides cavalry who were placed so as to intercept the
fugitives these fell with great vigour on the tribesmen and gave them a
much needed lesson It was now no longer an effete Sikh administration
that breakers of the law had to deal with but the strong right arm and
warlike guile of the British officer backed up by men who meant
fighting
It was now the spring of 1848 and great events were brewing in the
Punjab It was the lull between the two stormy gusts of the First and
Second Sikh Wars To us at this date it does not seem to require the
omniscience of a prophet prophesying after the event to discover that
the settlement arrived at after the First Sikh War contained most of the
possible elements of an unpermanent nature The Punjab was to remain a
Sikh province with the infant son of the Lion of the Punjab as its
Sovereign but the real ruler of the kingdom of the Sikhs was a British
officer Henry Lawrence at the head of a council of regency To support
his authority British bayonets overawed the capital of the Punjab and
assumed the mien of those who hold their place by right of conquest
Attached to but really at the head of the minor centres of
administration were men like Herbert Edwardes Abbott Taylor George
Lawrence Nicholson and Agnew the stamp of highsouled pioneer who
though alone unguarded and hundreds of miles from succour by sheer
force of character makes felt the weight of British influence in favour
of just and cleanly government And acting thus honourably they were
naturally detested by the lower class of venal rulers whose idea of
government was and is at all times and on all occasions by persuasion
force or oppression to squeeze dry the people committed to their
charge Ready to the hand of a discontented satrap sighing for the
illicit gains of a less austere rule were the bands of discharged
soldiers their occupation gone who crowded every village It was easy
to show as was indeed the case that these discontented warriors owed
their present plight to the hated English For while one of the
conditions of peace after the First Sikh War insisted on the
disbandment of the greater portion of the formidable Sikh army the
enlightened expedient of enlisting our late enemies into our own army
had not yet been acted upon to any great extent To add to the danger
every town and hamlet harboured the chiefs and people of only a
halflost cause
Thus the train of revolt was laid with an almost fatal precision
throughout the province and only required the smallest spark to set it
alight At the head of the incendiary movement was the Maharani the
wife of the late and mother of the present infant king Some inkling of
the plot as could hardly fail came to the British Residents ears the
primary step contemplated being to seduce from their allegiance the
Companys troops quartered at Lahore
It was at this stage that a summons reached Lumsden to march with all
despatch to Lahore a distance of two hundred and fifty miles Here was
an opportunity of testing the value of a corps whose loyalty was above
question and which from its composition could have no sympathy with the
movement Consequently to Lumsden and his men was assigned the difficult
and unaccustomed duty of unravelling the plot and bringing the
conspirators to justice Setting to work with his accustomed readiness
and aided by one of his ressaldars2 Fatteh Khan Khuttuk of whose
prowess on many a bloody field the story will in due course be told
Lumsden with characteristic alacrity undertook this intricate and
dangerous duty His tracks covered so to speak by the unsuspicious
bearing of a blunt soldier in command of a corps of rugged transborder
warriors the unaccustomed role of a skilled detective was carried out
with promptness and success In the course of a very few days some of
the Guides had obtained conclusive proof regarding three matters that
the Maharani was at the head of the movement that her chief agent was
the Sikh general Khan Singh and that the Companys troops had already
been tampered with
2 Ressaldar a native commissioned officer of cavalry
As the plot thickened it was discovered that a meeting of the
conspirators including fifty or sixty men of various regiments was to
take place on a certain night at a certain place Lumsden patiently
awaited the event intending with the Guides to surround and capture the
conspirators redhanded But on the night fixed for the meeting a
retainer of General Khan Singh came to visit one of the Guides with
whom he was on friendly terms and in the course of conversation made it
evident that his master was not easy in his mind why not no one could
say and that he had half determined on flight The man of the Guides
leaving his friend in charge of a comrade with commendable acumen
hastened to Lumsden and told him the story That officer at once saw
that the moment had come to strike lest the prey escape He therefore
immediately clapped the Sikh generals retainer into the quarterguard
much to that individuals astonishment and promptly parading the
Guides hurried down to the city and surrounded Khan Singhs house
It was now past eleven oclock the house was in darkness and strongly
barricaded all round the city was that of a foreign power and no
police or other warrant did Lumsden hold But he was no man to stand
on ceremony or shirk responsibility nor was he one for a moment to
count on the personal risks he ran Finding the doors stouter than they
expected his men burst in a window and headed by their intrepid
officer dashed into the building There overcoming promptly any show of
resistance they seized General Khan Singh his munshi3 and a
confidential agent together with a box of papers and under close guard
carried them back to the Guides camp In due course the prisoners were
tried and conclusive evidence being furnished and confirmed by the
incriminating documents found in the box General Khan Singh and his
munshi were sentenced to be hanged This prompt dealing served at once
to check rebellion in the vicinity of Lahore and placed the Companys
troops beyond the schemes of conspirators
3 Munshi a secretary or clerk
Amongst other papers found in Khan Singhs box were some which clearly
inculpated the Maharani and it was at once decided to deport her beyond
the region of effective intrigue The lady was under arrangements made
for her by the Government at this time residing in one of the late
Maharajas palaces at Sheikapura about twentythree miles from Lahore
To Lumsden and his men was entrusted the duty of arresting and deporting
the firebrand princess As taking part in this mission first appears in
the annals of the Guides the name of Lieutenant WSR Hodson
afterwards famous for his many deeds of daring and whose name still
lives as the intrepid and dashing leader of Hodsons Horse Appointed as
adjutant and secondincommand to a born exponent of sound yet daring
