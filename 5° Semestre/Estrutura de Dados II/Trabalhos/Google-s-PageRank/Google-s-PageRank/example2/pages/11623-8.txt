The first part of the plan requires no further remarks and the last not
much No literary work of Drydens of any great importance has been
discovered since Scotts edition appeared A few letters will have to be
added though I am sorry to say that I cannot promise my readers the
satisfaction which Dryden students chiefly desirethe satisfaction of
reading or at least knowing the contents of the Knole correspondence
In reply to a request of mine Lord Sackville has positively though
very courteously refused to lift the embargo which his predecessors
have placed on this nor have my inquiries succeeded as yet in
discovering any hitherto unpublished letters though the present
collection will for the first time present those which have been
published in a complete form I think that it may not be uninteresting
for readers to have an opportunity of comparing with the undoubted work
two plays The Mistaken Husband and The Modish Lovers which good
authorities have suspected to be possibly Drydens These will
accordingly be given in the last volume of the plays A bibliography of
Dryden and writers on Dryden and a certain number of pieces
justificatives of various kinds will also be added as well as
notes and where the subject seems to demand them appendices on points
of importance These additional notes and appendices will be bracketed
and signed ED Drydens own notes which are rare will be indicated by
a D and Scotts will stand without indication
The principles upon which I have proceeded in reediting the text
require somewhat fuller explanation Dryden never superintended any
complete edition of his works but on the other hand there is evidence
in his letters that he bestowed considerable pains on them when they
first passed through the press The first editions have therefore in
every case been followed though they have been corrected in case of
need by the later ones But the adoption of this standard leaves
unsettled the problem of orthography punctuation etc I have adopted a
solution of this which will not I fear be wholly agreeable to some of
my friends Capital letters apostrophes and the like will be looked
for in vain It would I need hardly say have been much less trouble to
put copies of the original editions into the hands of the printers to
bid them follow copy and to content myself with seeing that the
reprint was faithful The result would have been to a very small number
of professed students of English literature an interesting example of
the changes which printers spelling underwent in the last forty years
of the seventeenth century But it would have been a nuisance and a
stumblingblock to the ordinary reader in whose way it is certainly not
the business of the editor of a great English classic to throw stones of
offence Where a writer has written in a distinctly archaic form of
language as in the case of all English writers before the Renaissance
adherence to the original orthography is necessary and right Even in
the socalled Elizabethan age where a certain archaism of phrase
survives the appreciation of temporal and local colour may be helped by
such an adherence But Dryden is in every sense a modern His list of
obsolete words is insignificant of archaic phrases more insignificant
still of obsolete constructions almost a blank If any journalist or
reviewer were to write his tomorrows leader or his next weeks article
in a style absolutely modelled on Dryden no one would notice anything
strange in it except perhaps that the English was a good deal better
than usual There can therefore be no possible reason for erecting an
artificial barrier between him and his readers of today especially as
that barrier would be not only artificial but entirely arbitrary I
shall however return to this point in some prefatory remarks to the
dramas
Another problem which presented itself was the question of retaining the
irregular stichometric division in some plays and passages which are not
in verse Scott has in such case generally printed them in prose and
with some hesitation I have though not uniformly followed him
I have already received much help from divers persons and I trust
dis faventibus to acknowledge this and more at the end of my
journey in to use a word for which a great writer of French fought
hard a postface In a work of magnitude such as the present which
can only be proceeded with pedetentim the proverb about the
relations of beginner and finisher is peculiarly applicable For the
present I shall confine myself to mentioning with the utmost
thankfulness the kindness of Mr EW Gosse who has placed at my
disposal an almost complete set of first editions of the plays and
poems One word must be said as to the Life which fills this first
volume Except in minor details there is little to add to it Any
biographer of Dryden who is not carried away by the desire to magnify
his office must admit that Johnsons opening sentence as to the paucity
of materials is still applicable
In conclusion I have but to repeat that in this edition it is not my
ambition to put myself or my own writing forward even to the extent
ordinarily possible to an editor In particular my plan excludes
indulgence in critical disquisitions however tempting they may be For
such I must refer my readers to the monograph already mentioned
Occasionally where critical opinions of Scotts are advanced which seem
demonstrably erroneous or imperfect something of this nature will be
found but on the whole my object is to give the reader my author and
not what I have to say about him The office of Greek neokoros is a
comparatively humble one in itself but it is honourable enough when the
shrine is at once the work and the monument of two such masters of
English as Scott and Dryden

Prefaced to Edition issued in 1808 edited by Sir Walter
Scott
After the lapse of more than a century since the authors death the
Works of Dryden are now for the first time presented to the public in
a complete and uniform edition In collecting the pieces of one of our
most eminent English classicsone who may claim at least the third
place in that honoured list and who has given proofs of greater
versatility of talent than either Shakespeare or Milton though justly
placed inferior to them in their peculiar provincesthe Editor did not
feel himself entitled to reject any part of his writings even of those
which reflect little honour on the age by whose taste they were
dictated Had a selection been permitted he would have excluded several
of the Comedies and some part of the Translations but this is a
liberty which has not lately been indulged to editors of classical
poetry Literary history is an important step in that of man himself
and the unseductive coarseness of Dryden is rather a beacon than a
temptation
In commencing this task the Editor had hopes of friendly assistance
which might have rendered his toil more easy and the result more
accurate Deprived of this by a concurrence of unlucky circumstances he
has both to dread the imperfection of his labours and the consequence
of perhaps an overzeal to render his edition complete In the first
respect although he has many thanks to return for information readily
afforded it has sometimes been received after the irrevocable
operations of the printer had taken place1 On the second point he
may have been too lavish in historical notes and entered too deeply
into the secret history of the persons and times to which Drydens
satirical poems refer But he has endeavoured to avail himself of all
information so soon as communicated whether corrective or
corroborative of his prior opinions and the wish not only to render
intelligible blanks allusions and feigned names but to present if
possible the very spirit and political character of Drydens
contemporaries must be the excuse for intruding a few pages of
political history and personal anecdote which after all they whose
memory does not require such refreshment may easily dispense with
reading In this last part of his task the Editor has been greatly
assisted by free access to a valuable collection of the fugitive pieces
of the reigns of Charles II James II William III and Queen Anne
This curious collection was made by Narcissus Luttrell Esq under
whose name the Editor usually quotes it The industrious collector seems
to have bought every poetical tract of whatever merit which was hawked
through the streets in his time marking carefully the price and date of
the purchase His collection contains the earliest editions of many of
our most excellent poems bound up according to the order of time with
the lowest trash of Grub Street It was dispersed on Mr Luttrells
death but a number of the volumes referring chiefly to the latter part
of Charles the Seconds reign have fortunately become the property of
Mr James Bindley of Somerset Place who with the utmost urbanity
permitted the Editor the unlimited use of these and other literary
curiosities in his valuable libraryIt is so much a matter of course
with every adventurer in the field of antiquities to acknowledge the
liberality and kindness of Mr Richard Heber that the public would
probably be surprised had his extensive literary treasures escaped
contribution on this occasion particularly as it contains several
additional volumes of the Luttrell collection To both gentlemen the
Editor has to offer his public thanks nor will he be tempted to dilate
further on the liberality of the one and the tried friendship of the
other It is possible that these researches may by their very nature
have in some degree warped the Editors taste and induced him to
consider that as curious which was only scarce and to reprint
quotations from the adversaries or contemporaries of Dryden of a
length more than sufficient to satisfy the reader of their unworthiness
But as the painter places a human figure to afford the means of
computing the elevation of the principal object in his landscape it
seemed that the giantheight of Dryden above the poets of his day
might be best ascertained by extracts from those who judged themselves
and were sometimes deemed by others his equals or his superiors For
the same reason there are thrown into the Appendix a few indifferent
verses to the poets memory which while they show how much his loss
was felt point out at the same time the impossibility of supplying
it
In the Biographical Memoir it would have been hard to exact that the
Editor should rival the criticism of Johnson or produce facts which had
escaped the accuracy of Malone While however he has availed himself
of the labours of both particularly of the latter whose industry has
removed the cloud which so long hung over the events of Drydens life
he has endeavoured to take a different and more enlarged view of the
subject than that which his predecessors have presented The general
critical view of Drydens works being sketched by Johnson with
unequalled felicity and the incidents of his life accurately discussed
and ascertained by Malone something seemed to remain for him who should
consider these literary productions in their succession as actuated by
and operating upon the taste of an age where they had so predominant
influence and who might at the same time connect the life of Dryden
with the history of his publications without losing sight of the fate
and character of the individual How far this end has been attained is
not for the Editor to guess especially when as usual at the close of a
work he finds he is possessed of double the information he had when he
commenced it The kindness of Mr Octavius Gilchrist who undertook a
journey to Northamptonshire to examine the present state of Rushton
where Dryden often lived and of Mr Finlay of Glasgow who favoured the
Editor with the use of some original editions falls here to be
gratefully acknowledged
In collecting the poetry of Dryden some hymns translated from the
service of the Catholic Church were recovered by the favour of Captain
MacDonogh of the Inverness Militia2 As the body of the work was then
printed off they were inserted in the Life of the Author but should a
second impression of this edition be required by the public they shall
be transferred to their proper place To the Letters of Dryden
published in Mr Malones edition of his prose works the Editor has
been enabled to add one article by the favour of Mrs White of
Bownanhall Gloucestershire Those preserved at Knowles were examined at
the request of a noble friend and the contents appeared unfit for
publication Drydens translations of Fresnoys Art of Painting and of
the Life of Xavier are inserted without abridgment for reasons which
are elsewhere alleged3 From the version of Maimbourgs History of
the League there is an extract given which may be advantageously read
along with the Duke of Guise and the Vindication of that play The
prefaces and dedications are of course prefixed to the pieces to which
they belong but those who mean to study them with reference to
theatrical criticism will do well to follow the order recommended by
Mr Malone4
Several pieces published in Derricks edition of Drydens poetry being
obviously spurious are here published separately from his authentic
poetry and with a suitable note of suspicion prefixed to each They
might indeed have been altogether discarded without diminishing the
value of the work Some account might be here given of the various
editions of Drydens poems but notices of this kind have been liberally
scattered through the Life and preliminary matter
Upon the whole it is hoped that as the following is the first complete
edition of the Works of Dryden it will be found in accuracy of text
and copiousness of illustration not altogether unworthy of the time
labour and expense which have been ungrudgingly bestowed upon an object
so important to English literature

VOL I
THE LIFE OF JOHN DRYDEN
SECTION I
Preliminary Remarks on the Poetry of England before the Civil Wars
The Life of Dryden from his Birth till the RestorationHis early Poems
including the Annus Mirabilis
The Life of Dryden may be said to comprehend a history of the Literature
of England and its changes during nearly half a century While his
great contemporary Milton was in silence and secrecy laying the
foundation of that immortal fame which no poet has so highly deserved
Drydens labours were ever in the eye of the public and he maintained
from the time of the Restoration till his death in 1700 a decided and
acknowledged superiority over all the poets of his age As he wrote from
necessity he was obliged to pay a certain deference to the public
opinion for he whose bread depends upon the success of his volume is
compelled to study popularity but on the other hand his better
judgment was often directed to improve that of his readers so that he
alternately influenced and stooped to the national taste of the day If
therefore we would know the gradual changes which took place in our
poetry during the above period we have only to consult the writings of
an author who produced yearly some new performance allowed to be most
excellent in the particular style which was fashionable for the time It
is the object of this memoir to connect with the account of Drydens
life and publications such a general view of the literature of the time
as may enable the reader to estimate how far the age was indebted to the
poet and how far the poet was influenced by the taste and manners of
the age A few preliminary remarks on the literature of the earlier part
of the seventeenth century will form a necessary introduction to this
biographical memoir
1When James I ascended the throne of England he came to rule a court
and people as much distinguished for literature as for commerce and
arms Shakespeare was in the zenith of his reputation and England
possessed other poets inferior to Shakespeare alone or indeed the
higher order of whose plays may claim to be ranked above the inferior
dramas ascribed to him Among these we may reckon Massinger who
approached to Shakespeare in dignity Beaumont and Fletcher who
surpassed him in drawing female characters and those of polite and
courtly life and Jonson who attempted to supply by depth of learning
and laboured accuracy of character the want of that flow of
imagination which nature had denied to him Others who flourished in
the reign of James and his son though little known to the general
readers of the present age even by name had a just claim to be
distinguished from the common herd of authors Ford Webster Marston
Brome Shirley even Chapman and Decker added lustre to the stage for
which they wrote The drama it is true was the branch of poetry most
successfully cultivated for it afforded the most ready appeal to the
public taste The number of theatres then open in all parts of the city
secured to the adventurous poet the means of having his performance
represented upon one stage or other and he was neither tired nor
disgusted by the difficulties and disagreeable observances which must
now be necessarily undergone by every candidate for dramatic laurels2
But although during the reigns of Queen Elizabeth and James I the
stage seems to have afforded the principal employment of the poets
there wanted not many who cultivated with success the other
departments of Parnassus It is only necessary to name Spenser whose
magic tale continues to interest us in despite of the languor of a
continued allegory Drayton who though less known possesses perhaps
equal powers of poetry Beaumont the elder whose poem on Bosworth Field
carries us back to the days of the Plantagenets Fairfax the translator
of Tasso the melody of whose numbers became the model of Waller
besides many others who ornamented this era of British literature
Notwithstanding the splendour of these great names it must be
confessed that one common fault in a greater or less degree pervaded
the most admired poetry of Queen Elizabeths age This was the fatal
propensity to false wit to substitute namely strange and
unexpected connections of sound or of idea for real humour and even
for the effusions of the stronger passions It seems likely that this
fashion arose at court a sphere in which its denizens never think they
move with due lustre until they have adopted a form of expression as
well as a system of manners different from that which is proper to
mankind at large In Elizabeths reign the court language was formed on
the plan of one Lillie a pedantic courtier who wrote a book entitled
Euphues and his England or the Anatomy of Wit3 which quality he
makes to consist in the indulgence of every monstrous and overstrained
conceit that can be engendered by a strong memory and a heated brain
applied to the absurd purpose of hatching unnatural conceits4 It
appears that this fantastical person had a considerable share in
determining the false taste of his age which soon became so general
that the tares which sprung from it are to be found even among the
choicest of the wheat Shakespeare himself affords us too many instances
of this fashionable heresy in wit and he who could create new worlds
out of his own imagination descended to low and often illtimed puns
and quibbles This was not an evil to be cured by the accession of our
Scottish James whose qualifications as a punster were at least equal to
his boasted kingcraft5 The false taste which had been
gaining ground even in the reign of Elizabeth now overflowed the whole
kingdom with the impetuosity of a landflood These outrages upon
language were committed without regard to time and place They were held
good arguments at the bar though Bacon sat on the woolsack and
eloquence irresistible by the most hardened sinner when King or Corbet
were in the pulpit6 Where grave and learned professions set the
example the poets it will readily be believed ran headlong into an
error for which they could plead such respectable example The
affectation of the word and of the letter for alliteration was
almost as fashionable as punning seemed in some degree to bring back
English composition to the barbarous rules of the ancient AngloSaxons
the merit of whose poems consisted not in the ideas but in the quaint
arrangement of the words and the regular recurrence of some favourite
sound or letter
This peculiar taste for twisting and playing upon words instead of
applying them to their natural and proper use was combined with the
similar extravagance of those whom Dr Johnson has entitled Metaphysical
Poets This class of authors used the same violence towards images and
ideas which had formerly been applied to words in truth the two styles
were often combined and even when separate had a kindred alliance with
each other It is the business of the punster to discover and yoke
together two words which while they have some resemblance in sound
the more exact the better convey a totally different signification The
metaphysical poet on the other hand piqued himself in discovering
hidden resemblances between ideas apparently the most dissimilar and in
combining by some violent and compelled association illustrations and
allusions utterly foreign from each other Thus did the metaphysical
poet resemble the quibbler exercising precisely the same tyranny over
ideas which the latter practised upon sounds only
Jonson gave an early example of metaphysical poetry indeed it was the
natural resource of a mind amply stored with learning gifted with a
tenacious memory and the power of constant labour but to which was
denied that vivid perception of what is naturally beautiful and that
happiness of expression which at once conveys to the reader the idea of
the poet These latter qualities unite in many passages of Shakespeare
of which the reader at once acknowledges the beauty the justice and
the simplicity But such Jonson was unequal to produce and he
substituted the strange forced and most unnatural though ingenious
analogies which were afterwards copied by Donne and Cowley7 In
reading Shakespeare we often meet passages so congenial to our nature
and feelings that beautiful as they are we can hardly help wondering
they did not occur to ourselves in studying Jonson we have often to
marvel how his conceptions could have occurred to any human being The
one is like an ancient statue the beauty of which springing from the
exactness of proportion does not always strike at first sight but rises
upon us as we bestow time in considering it the other is the
representation of a monster which is at first only surprising and
ludicrous or disgusting ever after When the taste for simplicity
however is once destroyed it is long ere a nation recovers it and the
metaphysical poets seem to have retained possession of the public favour
from the reign of James I till the beginning of the Civil Wars silenced
the muses The universities were perhaps to blame during this period of
usurpation for which it may be admitted in excuse that the
metaphysical poetry could only be practised by men whose minds were
deeply stored with learning and who could boldly draw upon a large fund
of acquired knowledge for supplying the expenditure of farfetched and
extravagant images which their compositions required The book of
Nature is before all men but when her limits are to be overstepped the
acquirement of adventitious knowledge becomes of paramount necessity
and it was but natural that Cambridge and Oxford should prize a style of
poetry to which depth of learning was absolutely indispensable
I have stated that the metaphysical poetry was fashionable during the
early part of Charles the Firsts reign It is true that Milton
descended to upbraid that unfortunate prince that the chosen companion
of his private hours was one William Shakespeare a player but
Charles admitted less sacred poets to share his partiality Ben Jonson
supplied his court with masques and his pageants with verses and
notwithstanding an illnatured story shared no inconsiderable portion
of his bounty8 Donne a leader among the metaphysical poets with
whom King James had punned and quibbled in person9 shared in a
remarkable degree the good graces of Charles I who may therefore be
supposed no enemy to his vein of poetry although neither his sincere
piety nor his sacred office restrained him from fantastic indulgence in
extravagant conceit even upon the most solemn themes which can be
selected for poetry10 Cowley who with the learning and acuteness of
Donne possessed the more poetical qualities of a fertile imagination
and frequent happiness of expression and who claims the highest place
of all who ever plied the unprofitable trade of combining dissimilar and
repugnant ideas was not indeed known to the king during his prosperity
but his talents recommended him at the military court of Oxford and the
Transcribers note word missing here in the original ingenious poet
of the metaphysical class enjoyed the applause of Charles before he
shared the exile of his consort Henrietta Cleveland also was honoured
with the early notice of Charles11 one of the most distinguished
metaphysical bards who afterwards exerted his talents of wit and satire
upon the royal side and strained his imagination for extravagant
invective against the Scottish army who sold their king and the
parliament leaders who bought him All these and others unnecessary to
mention were read and respected at court being esteemed by their
contemporaries and doubtless believing themselves the wonder of their
own and the pattern of succeeding ages and however much they
Transcribers note fragment of word only in original presume might
differ from each other in parts and genius they sought the same road to
poetical fame by starting the most unnatural images which their
imaginations could conceive or by hunting more common allusions through
the most minute and circumstantial particulars and ramifications
Yet though during the age of Charles I the metaphysical poets enjoyed
the larger proportion of public applause authors were not wanting who
sought other modes of distinguishing themselves Milton who must not be
named in the same paragraph with others although he had not yet
meditated the sublime work which was to carry his name to immortality
disdained even in his lesser compositions the preposterous conceits
and learned absurdities by which his contemporaries acquired
distinction Some of his slighter academic prolusions are indeed
tinged with the prevailing taste of his age or perhaps were written
in ridicule of it but no circumstance in his life is more remarkable
than that Comus the Monody on Lycidas the Allegro and Penseroso
and the Hymn on the Nativity are unpolluted by the metaphysical
jargon and affected language which the age esteemed indispensable to
poetry This refusal to bend to an evil so prevailing and which held
out so many temptations to a youth of learning and genius can only be
ascribed to the natural chastity of Miltons taste improved by an
earnest and eager study of the purest models of antiquity
But besides Milton who stood aloof and alone there was a race of
lesser poets who endeavoured to glean the refuse of the applause reaped
by Donne Cowley and their followers by adopting ornaments which the
latter had neglected perhaps because they could be attained without
much labour or abstruse learning The metaphysical poets in their
slipshod pindarics had totally despised not only smoothness and
elegance but the common rhythm of versification Many and long passages
may be read without perceiving the least difference between them and
barbarous jingling illregulated prose and in appearance though the
lines be divided into unequal lengths the eye and ear acknowledge
little difference between them and the inscription on a tombstone In a
word not only harmony of numbers but numbers themselves were
altogether neglected or if an author so far respected ancient practice
as to make lines which could be scanned like verse he had done his
part and was perfectly indifferent although they sounded like
prose12 But as melody will be always acceptable to the ear some
poets chose this neglected road to fame and gained a portion of public
favour by attending to the laws of harmony which their rivals had
discarded Waller and Denham were the first who thus distinguished
themselves but as Johnson happily remarks what was acquired by
Denham was inherited by Waller Something there was in the situation of
both these authors which led them to depart from what was then the
beaten path of composition They were men of rank wealth and fashion
and had experienced all the interruptions to deep study with which such
elevated station is naturally attended It was in vain for Waller a
wit a courtier and a politician or for Denham who was only
distinguished at the university as a dreaming dissipated gambler to
attempt to rival the metaphysical subtleties of Donne and Cowley who
had spent serious and sequestered lives in acquiring the knowledge and
