There were two little birds that built the nest
One sat and sung upon the garden wall
The other with her warm and downy breast
Covered the eggs so beautiful and small
Lullaby lullaby
One day some little birds came peeping out
And then they opened wide their mouths for food
The yellow birds flew down and skipped about
And brought them something very nice and good
Lullaby lullaby
And so they grew and grew till puss one day
Tore down the pretty nest with sudden rush
But Johnny saw and took the birds away
And placed them in the nest back on the bush
Lullaby lullaby
The old ones found them safe poor trembling things
They smoothed and fed them and that very day
They taught them how to spread their little wings
And mong the garden trees to soar away
Lullaby lullaby
SNOW
The snow the snow is coming
So graceful and light
All over every thing
Beautiful and white
A thousand thousand snowflakes
Theyre swimming in the air
They fall upon the cherrytrees
And hang like blossoms there
They are coming coming coming
As far as I can see
They light like little fairy birds
Upon the old oak tree
Each flake of snow is pretty
A spangle or a gem
But they melt away in dewdrops
I can not treasure them
They melt beneath the sunbeam
They sink into the ground
And where they vanish byandby
Sweet flowers will be found
And I am told they moisten
And make the flowrets grow
So welcome very welcome
Are the gentle flakes of snow
Poor lammie what a pity
One little foot is hurt
And the face that was so pretty
Is covered with the dirt
But up and never mind it
A little brook is near
Among the grass youll find it
The waters cool and clear
I guess you will feel better
Step in and take a drink
That shallow brook of water
With flowers around the brink
LULLABY
A woman gently rocks her easy chair
With a sweet infant lying on her breast
The gentle motion waving her long hair
As thus she sings her little one to rest
Lullaby lullaby
Another twilight and my heart is thrilled
Still with thy living beauty angel feet
This day have trod our threshold but to shield
And not to bear thee hence my baby sweet
Lullaby lullaby
One radiant star is shining in the west
A softer radiance is in thine eyes
Upon the slender stalk the blossoms rest
A sweeter blossom on my bosom lies
Lullaby lullaby
All thou mayest be I dare not image now
As thou in life shalt bear an earnest part
Only I pray that on thy spotless brow
The seal of heaven be set and true thy heart
Lullaby lullaby
The dew is falling and the leaves are stirred
With a low whispering of love and power
And thou art sleepy now my nestling bird
Shut thy blue eyes as softly shuts the flower
Lullaby lullaby
HYMN
God who is in heaven
Made all the pretty flowers
He sends the pleasant sunshine
And sends the dripping showers
He made all living creatures
And the earth to bring forth food
And we will love and praise him
For he is very good
2
Keep us in the midnight
Saviour dear
Through the hours of darkness
Oh be thou near
Powerless and lowly
We lean on thy arm
Watcher of Israel
Keep us from harm
WELCOME
There comes a little bird
In at the door
Do see Upon my word
Its on the floor
Little bird come and stay
Here you are welcome
Or you may fly away
To your own home
I will give you bread
Much as you say
After you have fed
You may skip away
There on the cherrytree
Build your downy nest
Or in any other
That you like best
Little birds pretty birds
Come to my door
If you have no words
Sing out for more

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate
International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works
Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBooks
eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII
compressed zipped HTML and others
Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number  The replaced older file is renamed
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
httpwwwgutenbergnet
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
EBooks posted prior to November 2003 with eBook numbers BELOW 10000
are filed in directories based on their release date  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year
httpwwwgutenbergnetetext06
Or etext 05 04 03 02 01 00 99
98 97 96 95 94 93 92 92 91 or 90
EBooks posted since November 2003 with etext numbers OVER 10000 are
filed in a different way  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path  The path is based on the etext number which is
identical to the filename  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergnet102310234
or filename 24689 would be found at
httpwwwgutenbergnet246824689
