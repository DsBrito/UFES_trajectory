PREFACE
This volume concludes the series begun in 1903 which was intended to
comprise all the best traditional ballads of England and Scotland The
scheme of classification by subjectmatter arbitrary and haphazard as
it may seem to be at one point or another has IA think proved more
satisfactory than could have been anticipated and in the end I have
omitted no ballad without due justification
In the fourteen years which have elapsed since the completion of
Professor Childas collection there has been discovered so far as I
know only one ballad that can claim the right to be added to his roll
of 305 aEnglish and Scottish Popular Balladsa That one is the carol of
The Bitter Withy which I was fortunate enough to recover in 1905
which my friend Professor Gerould of Princeton University has annotated
with an erudition worthy of Child and the genuineness of which has been
sponsored by Professor Gummere1 IA should perhaps have included this
in its place in my Second Series had I known of it in time but I still
hope to treat the traditional English Carols separately IA ought to
admit here that the confidence with which I claimed in my Third Series
aA place on the roll for The Jolly Juggler has abated and I now
consider it to be no more than a narrative lyric without any definitely
apopulara characteristics
These four volumes contain in all 143 ballads four of which are not to
be found in Childas collection2 Thus out of his 305 IA have omitted
more than half but it must be remembered that his work was a
collection and minesi parva licet componere magnishas been
selection The omitted ballads are either
i Fragmentary or mutilated
ii Closely related to ballads which I include
iii Uninteresting eg as dealing with obscure history
iv Degenerate
The last reason for exclusion particularly affects the Robin Hood
ballads among which Child prints thirtythree late broadsides and
fragments which I omit He preferred to err by inclusion rather than
exclusion and states that he has admitted more than one ballad
aactually worthless and manifestly spurious because of a remote
possibility that it might contain relics or be a debased
representative of something genuine and bettera3
I cannot take leave of nine yearsa intermittent work on this selection
without remembering that its aonly begettera was Mr AA H Bullen with
whom I published the first three volumes While I regret to think how
different it is in the result from the edition he then envisaged
IA gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to him for the inoculation The
anthologist is strictly a plucker of the flowers of literature but the
ballads are not literaturethey are lore and therefore of warmer human
interest

INTRODUCTION TO THE ROBIN HOOD BALLADS
aIt is our olde mannera sayd Robyn
aTo leve but lytell behyndea
aIt will scarcely be expected that one should be able to offer an
authentic narrative of the life and transactions of this extraordinary
personage The times in which he lived the mode of life he adopted
and the silence or loss of contemporary writers are circumstances
sufficiently favourable indeed to romance but altogether inimical to
historical trutha In these words Joseph Ritson the first and most
painstaking of those wellmeaning scholars who have tried to associate
the outlaw with ahistorical trutha begins his aLife of Robin Hooda
an account which occupies ten pages of his book and is annotated and
illustrated through the following one hundred and five pages The
Dictionary of National Biography includes Robin Hood as it includes
King Arthur but it is better to face the truth and to state boldly
that Robin Hood the yeoman outlaw never existed in the flesh As the
goddess Athena sprang from the head of Zeus Robin Hood sprang from the
imagination of the English people
That being so he is a creation of whom the English people who have
kept him so long alive where he was born and bred should be proud and
after reflecting on his essential characteristicshis love of the poor
his courteous robbery of the higher orders both spiritual and temporal
his loyalty to the king his freedom with the kingas deer and his
esteem of all women for the sake of the Virginan Englishman should be
the first to resent any attempt to identify so truly popular a hero
either with one of several historical nonentities or with a member of
the aristocracy or worst of all with an Aryan sunmyth
All these attempts have been made at one time or another but not until
the spirit which begot him had begun to dwindle in the English heart If
King Arthur is the ideal knight of Celtic chivalry Robin is the ideal
champion of the popular cause under feudal conditions his enemies are
bishops fat monks and the sheriff who would restrain his liberty It
is natural that an enfranchised yeoman who took toll of the oppressors
and so effected what we still call a redistribution of wealth should be
the hero of the oppressed and the lawabiding poor and it is natural
that as social conditions altered for better or for worse with the
national prosperity under Elizabeth and classes and masses reconsidered
their relative positions Robin should fall from the popular pantheon
and should degenerate as we find him degenerated in the broadsides of
the Reformation hacks into a swashbuckler unheroic enough to be
defeated in quarterstaff bouts and so undemocratic as to find for
himself a noble title and a wife of high degree
There are then four Robin Hoods
i The popular outlaw of the greenwood as revealed to us in the
older ballads
ii The quasihistorical Robin the outlaw ennobled by a
contradiction in terms as the Earl of Huntingdon Robert Fitzooth
etc and the husband of Matilda
iii One of a number of actual Robert Hoods whose existence
and insignificance has been proved from historical documents
iv Robin Hood or Robin oa Wood explained by German scholars as
the English representative of Woden or a woodgod or some other
mythical personage
We will now investigate these in turn attempting so far as may be
possible to keep them distinct
I THE BALLAD HERO ROBIN HOOD
The earliest known reference to Robin Hood the outlaw was first pointed
out by Bishop Percy the editor of the Reliques in Piers Plowman
the poem written by Langland about 1377 where Sloth says BA text
passus v 401
aBut I can know rymes of Robyn hood and Randolf erle of Chestrea
Observing that this first mention of Robin is as the subject of ballads
and that he is coupled with another popular hero one of the
twelfthcentury Earls of Chester we pass to the next reference
aLytill Ihon and Robyne Hude
Waythmen ware commendyd gude
In Yngilwode and Barnysdale
Thai oysyd all this tyme thare trawalea
This passage from Wyntounas Chronicle of Scotland about 1420 is
referred to the year 1283 and means that Robin and his man Little John
were known as good hunters cfA awight yeomena constantly in the
ballads and they carried on their business in Inglewood and Barnsdale
at this time
In 1439 a petition was presented to Parliament concerning a certain
Piers Venables of whom it is stated that having no other livelihood
he agadered and assembled unto him many misdoersa and awente into the
wodes in that contrA like as it hadde be Robynhode and his meynAa
About the same time c 1437 a longer description is given in Fordunas
Scotichronicon which was revised and continued by Bower where the
latter states that Robin Hood athat most celebrated robbera was one
of the dispossessed and banished followers of Simon de Montfort
He proceeds however to couple with him aLitill Johannea and their
associates aof whom the foolish vulgar in comedies and tragedies make
lewd entertainment and are delighted to hear the jesters and minstrels
sing them above all other balladsa4 and to describe briefly one of
the atragediesa
An extract from one more chronicler will suffice and it should be noted
that these three Wyntoun Bower and Major are all Scottish John
Major orA Mair was born about 1450 and his Historia Maioris
BritanniA was published in 1521 In the part dealing with the reign of
Richard I lib iv capA ii we find
aAbout this time it was as I conceive that there flourished those most
famous robbers Robert Hood an Englishman and Little John who lay in
wait in the woods but spoiled of their goods those only who were
wealthy They took the life of no man unless either he attacked them or
offered resistance in defence of his property Robert supported by his
plundering a hundred bowmen ready fighters every one with whom four
hundred of the strongest would not dare to engage in combat The feats
of this Robert are told in song all over Britain He would allow no
woman to suffer injustice nor would he spoil the poor but rather
enriched them from the plunder taken from abbots The robberies of this
man I condemn but of all thieves he was the prince and the most gentle
thiefa5 This is repeated almost verbatim in Stowas Annales 1681
These five references show that Robin Hood was popular in ballads for at
least a century before the date at which we find those ballads in print
and apart from the fact that printing is usually the last thing that
happens to a ballad of the folk the language in which they are written
is unmistakably Middle Englishthat is to say the Gest of Robyn Hode
atA least may be dated nearer 1400 than 1500 But Langlandas evidence
is clear arymesa of Robin Hood were widely known by 1377 Neither Bower
nor Major know anything of Robin except what they learnt from the
ballads about him
Footnote 4 So translated by Ritson aComedies and tragediesa is
an ambiguous phrase in the fifteenth century and may mean either
the dramatised Maygames or ballads Cf Chambers MediAval
Stage ii 211
Footnote 5 Translation except the last phrase by AA Constable
Edinburgh 1892
II ROBIN HOOD EARL OF HUNTINGDON
In attempting to provide Robin Hood with a noble ancestry Ritson
quotes amongst other authorities aA manuscript life of Robin which as
it supplied him with other errors had best be put out of court at once
This is Sloane MS 780 Ritson calls it 715 which is due to the fact
that in his time Sloane MSS 7157 7201 and 7801 were bound up
together it is of the early seventeenth century which is much too
late for any faith to be put in its statements
No allusion to the noble descent of Robin Hood has been found earlier
than one in Graftonas Chronicle 1569 where the author alleges that he
takes this information from aan olde and auncient pamphleta As Child
says we must ainvoke the spirit of Ritson to pardon the taking of no
very serious notice of Robin Hoodas noble extractiona
Stukely an antiquary who published his PalAographia Britannica in
1746 derived aRobert Fitzooth commonly called Robin Hood pretended
Earl of Huntingdona from a series of AngloNorman lords
It would be almost unnecessary to mention the two Elizabethan plays
concerning Robert the Earl were it not for an ingenious suggestion made
in connection with them The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntington
and The Death of the same were written by Anthony Munday and Henry
Chettle and are first mentioned in Hensloweas Diary in 1598 The
Earl being outlawed flies to Sherwood Forest accompanied by Matilda
daughter of Lord Fitzwater and there he assumes the style and title of
Robin Hood and calls Matilda Maid Marian This plot is introduced by an
induction in which John Skelton the poet appears as stagemanager and
it has been suggested that Mundayas play may be founded on a nowlost
interlude or pageant of Skeltonas composing Robert Lord FitzWalter
aA descendant from the original Earls of Huntingdon was patron of the
living at Diss in Norfolk which Skelton helda6

III HISTORICAL ROBIN HOODS
In 1852 Joseph Hunter issued as No 4 of his aCritical and Historical
Tractsa The Great Hero of the ancient Minstrelsy of England Robin
Hood Amongst other discoveries he found in an Exchequer document of
expenses in the royal household of Edward II the name of aRobyn Hodea
occurring several times as a avadleta or aporteur de la chambrea at the
salary of threepence per diem between March and November of 1324
Various other researchers have succeeded in tracing half a dozen people
all named Robin or Robert Hood within a period of some forty years of
the fourteenth century but few have pressed identification with Robin
Hood the outlaw so far as Hunter awhoa says Professor Child acould
have identified Pigrogromitus and Quinapalus if he had given his mind
to ita Working on the above datum Hunter shows how probable it is that
Robin Hood the outlaw entered the service of Edward II at Nottingham
where the king was from November 923 in 1323 But the Robin whose
fortunes Hunter raked up was a very bad servant and within a year from
the alleged date was ignominiously dismissed from the kingas service
with a present of 5s abecause he was no longer able to worka Was this
the invincible champion of English yeomen Was this the hand that
launched a thousand shafts
The only point to which attention need be called is the obvious fact
that aRobert Hooda was not an uncommon combination of names at least in
fourteenthcentury England
IV ROBIN HOOD THE MYTH
In 1845 Adalbert Kuhn in Hauptas Zeitschrift v 47294 attempted to
show that Robin Hood was a mythological figure representing one of the
manifestations of Woden as a vegetation deity and half a century later
Sir JA H Ramsay suggested that he was a woodspirit corresponding to
the Hodeken of German tradition Theories such as this7 seem to be
fascinating to all sorts of scholars perhaps because they involve
continually a minute appreciation of fine shades of probability In the
present instance they reach a point at which it is suggested that the
rosegarland worn by the Potternot in the ballad of Robin Hood and
the Potter but in the later playis a survival of the Strife between
Summer and Winter Certainly there is no need to seek a mythological
origin for the Robin Hood of the ballads but we must proceed to
consider the Robin of folkdrama
To do this it is necessary to go back some centuries before the time at
which we first hear of Robin Hood the outlaw and to follow the
development of the English folkas summer festival from song and dance to
drama and from the folkgamesthe aInduction of Maya the aInduction
of Autumna the aPlay of the King and the Queena which separately or
together were performed at least as early as the thirteenth centuryto
the aMaygamea or aKingas gamea of the middle of the fifteenth century
Going back again to the thirteenth century and crossing over to France
we find in the fAates du maiwhich were evolved with the help of the
minstrels from the French folkas summer festivalthe names of Robin
and Marion customarily appropriated to the king and queen of these
fAates
Now between 1450 and 1500 the Maygame becomes associated in England
with Robin Hood setting aside the possibility that Boweras reference
mentioned above to acomedies and tragediesa may allude to the
Maygame we can find many entries in parish records from all parts of
England which show that the summer folkfestival has developed into a
play of Robin Hood Further it has been very plausibly suggested8
that about the same time the French Robin becoming confused with the
English one brought in Marion aA French name and thus supplied our
Robin Hood with his Maid Marian who has no place in the true ballads of
the outlaw
In 1473 Sir John Paston wrote a letter in which he refers to a servant
of whom he says aIA have kepyd hym this iii yer to pleye Saynt Jorge and
Robyn Hod and the Shryff of Nottynghama There has also survived a leaf
of manuscriptperhaps it is only an accident that it was formerly in
the possession of the first editor of the Paston Lettersof about the
same date which contains a portion of the play to which Sir John
refers that of Robin Hood and the Sheriff of Nottingham9 which is
founded upon a story similar to that of the ballad of Robin Hood and
Guy of Gisborne see pA 128 Besides this fragment we have in William
Coplandas edition of the Gest a dramatic appendix of athe playe of
Robyn Hoode verye proper to be played in Maye gamesa printed c
1560 this in fact consists of two plays carelessly tagged together
first Robin Hood and the Friar who is distinctly called Friar Tuck
and second Robin Hood and the Potter partly founded on the ballad of
that name Friar Tuck it should be noted occurs also in the earlier
fragmentary play but there is no friar in Robin Hoodas ameyniea in any
of the older ballads and no Maid Marian in either the older ballads or
the above plays
These complications of Robin Hoodas company are further confused by the
fact that the morrisdance which was universally affiliated to the
Maygame borrowed therefrom not only Maid Marian but Robin Hood Little
John and Friar Tuck so that amongst the later ballads and broadsides we
find Robinas company increased However by that time Robin himself had
degenerated from the fine character exhibited in the earlier ballads
given in this volume

made in the Gentlemanas Magazine for March 1793 over the
signature DA H

Trinity College Cambridge by Mr Aldis Wright It may be seen in

mentioned above are also reprinted

TOPOGRAPHY OF ROBIN HOODaS HAUNTS
Although Robin Hood belongs in legend no more exclusively to any
definite district than his noble forerunner King Arthur yet like King
Arthur he has become associated particularly with one or two haunts
and it is no easiernor in the end more profitableto reconcile
Lyonnesse with Carlisle and Inglewood10 than to disentangle Robin Hood
of Barnsdale from Robin Hood of Sherwood Forest
The simplest way to begin is to eliminate from our consideration the
numerous Robin Hoodas Hills Wells Stones Oaks or Butts some of
which may be found as far distant as Gloucestershire and Somerset
for many of these probably bear his name in much the same way as other
natural freaks bear the Devilas name AA large number can be found in
what may be called Robin Hoodas homecounties Yorkshire and those which
touch YorkshireLancashire Derby Nottingham and Lincoln shires
Undoubtedly the evidence of the best ballads goes to show that at one
time there must have been at least two cycles of Robin Hood ballads
one placing him in Barnsdale the other allotting him headquarters in
Sherwood but it appears that even the ballads of the fifteenth century
make little effort to discriminate between the two Robin Hood and the
Monk MS of c 1450 introduces us in its first five lovely
stanzas to Sherwood in Robin Hood and the Potter MS of c 1500
the scene is Nottingham in the Sherwood district Little John refers to
Wentbridge which lies in the heart of Barnsdale yet knows every path
in merry Sherwood
In the Gest compiled as it is from ballads of both cycles no attempt
was made to reconcile their various topographies but it can be seen
that the general geography of the first division of the Gest Fyttes
I II and IV is that of Barnsdale while the second division Fyttes
III V and VI dealing with the Sheriff of Nottingham mainly centres
round Sherwood In the seventh Fytte the King goes presumably from
London 3223 to Nottingham via Lancashire and the eighth jumps
from Nottingham to Kirksley11
In Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne certainly an early ballad although
the Percy Folio which supplies the only text is c 1650 the scene
is specified as Barnsdale yet at the end the Sheriff of Nottingham
flees to his house as if it were hard by whereas he had a fiftymile
run before him The later ballads forget Barnsdale altogether
Footnote 10 It should be remembered that Wyntoun says that Robin
Hood plied his trade in Inglewood and Barnsdale see ante
pA xiv
Footnote 11 Child in saying that aRobin Hood has made a vow to
go from London to Barnsdalea vA 51 seems to assume that the
akingas courta Gest 433 implies London which however
is not specified
BARNSDALE
Illustration
ROBIN HOODaS HAUNTS in the West Riding of YORKSHIRE
The majority of the places mentioned in the northern or Barnsdale cycle
will be found in the south of the West Riding of Yorkshire aA district
bounded by the East Riding and Lincolnshire to the east Derby and
Nottingham shires to the south and the river Calder to the north To
the west the natural boundary is the high ground of the Peak which
divides Manchester from Sheffield
The town of Barnsley lies slightly to the east of a line joining Leeds
and Sheffield Barnsdale itself is east and north of Barnsley where the
high backbone of the Pennines drops towards the flats surrounding the
river Humber The great North Road aWatling Streeta Gest 182
between Doncaster and Pontefract crosses the small slow river Went at
Wentbridge probably referred to in st 135 of the Gest which may be
taken as the northern boundary of Barnsdale That this part of the North
Road was considered unsafe for travellers as early as Edward Ias reign
is shown by the fact that a party going from Scotland to Winchester and
for most of the journey guarded by a dozen archers saw fit to increase
their number of guards to twenty between Pontefract and Tickhill
the latter being on the border of Yorkshire and Nottingham south of
Doncaster
The remaining places except those explained in the footnotes may be
dealt with here
aBlytha Gest 274 2594 twice mentioned as a place at which to
dine is a dozen miles south of Doncaster and in Nottingham it is
almost exactly halfway between Barnsdale and Sherwood
aVerysdalea Gest 1264 may be Wyersdale aA wild tract of the old
Forest of Lancashire near Lancaster
aHoldernessa Gest 1491 is the nose of Yorkshire between the
southeasterly turn of the Humber below Hull and the North Sea
aKyrkeslya Gest 4513 4543 or aChurchleesa Robin Hoodas
Death 13 Kirklees Priory is on the left or north bank of the river
Calder aA few miles north of Huddersfield
aSt Mary Abbeya is ahere besydea Gest 544 and in York 844
SHERWOOD
The name of Sherwood is not mentioned in the Gest though that of
Nottingham is frequent The old forest was a district about twentyfive
miles square lying to the north of Nottingham between that town and
Worksop including Mansfield and to the north the district now known
as athe Dukeriesa ie the parks of Welbeck Clumber and Rufford
There is a village of Sherwood aA northern suburb of Nottingham and a
Sherwood Hall near Mansfield between the two may be found Friar Tuckas
Well Robin Hoodas Well Robin Hoodas Stable and a Robin Hood Hill
But as has been pointed out above these names have little significance
in view of the fact that similarlynamed objects can be found in other
counties
It is more interesting to note that a pasture called aRobynhode Clossea
ie close is mentioned in the Nottingham Chamberlainas accounts as
early as 1485 and a aRobynhode Wella in 1500

A GEST OF ROBYN HODE
aRebus huius Roberti gestis tota Britannia in cantibus utitura
MAJOR
The TextThere are seven texts of the Gest to be distinguished as
follows
i begins aHere begynneth a gest of Robyn Hodea an undated printed
fragment preserved with other early pieces in a volume in the Advocatesa
Library Edinburgh It was reprinted in 1827 by David Laing who then
supposed it to be from the press of Chepman and Myllar Edinburgh
printers of the early sixteenth century but he afterwards had reason to
doubt this opinion It is now attributed to Jan van Doesborch aA printer
from Antwerp The extent of this fragment is indicated below Internal
evidence collected by Child iiiA 40 shows it to be an older text than
ii aHere begynneth a lytell geste of Robyn hodeaso runs the
titlepage at the head of the poem are added the wordsaand his meyne
A meinie company And of the proude Sheryfe of Notynghama The
colophon runs aExplycit kynge Edwarde and Robyn hode and Lytell Johan
Enprented at London in fletestrete at the sygne of the sone By Wynken de
Wordea This also is undated and Child says it amay be anywhere from
1492 to 1534a Recent bibliographical research shows that Wynkyn de
Worde moved to Fleet Street at the end of the year 1500 which gives the
downward limit and as the printer died in 1584 the Lytell Geste must
be placed between those dates1 The text is complete save for two
lines 71 and 3391 which have also dropped from the other early
texts The only known copy is in the Cambridge University Library
iii iv and v Three mutilated printed fragments containing about
thirtyfive seventy and fifteen stanzas respectively preserved
amongst the Douce fragments in the Bodleian the last presented by JA O
HalliwellPhillipps The first was lent to Ritson in or before 1790 by
Farmer who thought it to be Rastellas printing in Ritsonas second
edition 1836 he says he gave it to Douce and states without reason
that it is of de Wordeas printing aprobably in 1489a
vi A mery geste of Robyn Hoode etc aA quarto preserved in the
British Museum not dated but printed aat London vpon the thre Crane
wharfe by wyllyam Coplanda who printed there about 1560 This edition
also contains aaA newe playe for to be played in Maye games very
plesaunte and full of pastymea
vii A Merry Iest of Robin Hood etc printed at London for Edward
White no date but perhaps the apastorall plesant commediea entered to
White in the Stationersa Registers May 14 1594 There is a copy of
this in the Bodleian and another was in the Huth Library
The Text here given is mainly the Wynkyn de Worde text except where
the earlier Edinburgh fragment is available the stanzas which the
latter preserves are here numbered 1833 11341241 12741332
