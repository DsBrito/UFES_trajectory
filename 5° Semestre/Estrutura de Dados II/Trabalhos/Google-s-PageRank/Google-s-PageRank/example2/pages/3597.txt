for it would methinks be against reason to punish little
inconveniences whilst we are infested with the greater  As the
physician Philotimus said to one who presented him his finger to dress
and who he perceived both by his complexion and his breath had an ulcer
in his lungs Friend it is not now time to play with your nails
Plutarch How we may distinguish a Flatterer from a Friend
And yet I saw some years ago a person whose name and memory I have in
very great esteem in the very height of our great disorders when there
was neither law nor justice nor magistrate who performed his office no
more than there is now publish I know not what pitiful reformations
about cloths cookery and law chicanery  Those are amusements wherewith
to feed a people that are illused to show that they are not totally
forgotten  Those others do the same who insist upon prohibiting
particular ways of speaking dances and games to a people totally
abandoned to all sorts of execrable vices  Tis no time to bathe and
cleanse ones self when one is seized by a violent fever it was for the
Spartans alone to fall to combing and curling themselves when they were
just upon the point of running headlong into some extreme danger of their
life
For my part I have that worse custom that if my slipper go awry I let
my shirt and my cloak do so too I scorn to mend myself by halves
When I am in a bad plight I fasten upon the mischief I abandon myself
through despair I let myself go towards the precipice and as they say
throw the helve after the hatchet I am obstinate in growing worse and
think myself no longer worth my own care I am either well or ill
throughout  T is a favour to me that the desolation of this kingdom
falls out in the desolation of my age I better suffer that my ill be
multiplied than if my well had been disturbedThat being ill I
should grow worse than that being well I should grow illThe words
I utter in mishap are words of anger my courage sets up its bristles
instead of letting them down and contrary to others I am more devout
in good than in evil fortune according to the precept of Xenophon if
not according to his reason and am more ready to turn up my eyes to
heaven to return thanks than to crave  I am more solicitous to improve
my health when I am well than to restore it when I am sick
prosperities are the same discipline and instruction to me that
adversities and rods are to others  As if good fortune were a thing
inconsistent with good conscience men never grow good but in evil
fortune  Good fortune is to me a singular spur to modesty and
moderation an entreaty wins a threat checks me favour makes me bend
fear stiffens me
Amongst human conditions this is common enough to be better pleased with
foreign things than with our own and to love innovation and change
Ipsa dies ideo nos grato perluit haustu
Quod permutatis hora recurrit equis
The light of day itself shines more pleasantly upon us because it
changes its horses every hour  Spoke of a water hourglass
adds  Cotton
I have my share  Those who follow the other extreme of being quite
satisfied and pleased with and in themselves of valuing what they have
above all the rest and of concluding no beauty can be greater than what
they see if they are not wiser than we are really more happy I do not
envy their wisdom but their good fortune
This greedy humour of new and unknown things helps to nourish in me the
desire of travel but a great many more circumstances contribute to it
I am very willing to quit the government of my house  There is I
confess a kind of convenience in commanding though it were but in a
barn and in being obeyed by ones people but tis too uniform and
languid a pleasure and is moreover of necessity mixed with a thousand
vexatious thoughts one while the poverty and the oppression of your
tenants another quarrels amongst neighbours another the trespasses
they make upon you afflict you
Aut verberatae grandine vineae
Fundusque mendax arbore nunc aquas
Culpante nunc torrentia agros
Sidera nunc hyemes iniquas
Or hailsmitten vines and the deceptive farm now trees damaged
by the rains or years of dearth now summers heat burning up the
petals now destructive wintersHoratius Od iii I 29
and that God scarce in six months sends a season wherein your bailiff can
do his business as he should but that if it serves the vines it spoils
the meadows
Aut nimiis torret fervoribus aetherius sol
Aut subiti perimunt imbres gelidoeque pruinae
Flabraque ventorum violento turbine vexant
Either the scorching sun burns up your fields or sudden rains or
frosts destroy your harvests or a violent wind carries away all
before itLucretius V 216
to which may be added the new and neatmade shoe of the man of old that
hurts your foot
Leclerc maliciously suggests that this is a sly hit at Montaignes
wife the man of old being the person mentioned in Plutarchs Life
of Paulus Emilius c 3 who when his friends reproached him for
repudiating his wife whose various merits they extolled pointed to
his shoe and said That looks a nice wellmade shoe to you but I
alone know where it pinches
and that a stranger does not understand how much it costs you and what
you contribute to maintain that show of order that is seen in your
family and that peradventure you buy too dear
I came late to the government of a house they whom nature sent into the
world before me long eased me of that trouble so that I had already
taken another bent more suitable to my humour  Yet for so much as I
have seen tis an employment more troublesome than hard whoever is
capable of anything else will easily do this  Had I a mind to be rich
that way would seem too long I had served my kings a more profitable
traffic than any other  Since I pretend to nothing but the reputation of
having got nothing or dissipated nothing conformably to the rest of my
life improper either to do good or ill of any moment and that I only
desire to pass on I can do it thanks be to God without any great
endeavour  At the worst evermore prevent poverty by lessening your
expense tis that which I make my great concern and doubt not but to do
it before I shall be compelled  As to the rest I have sufficiently
settled my thoughts to live upon less than I have and live contentedly
Non aestimatione census verum victu atque cultu
terminantur pecunix modus
Tis not by the value of possessions but by our daily subsistence
and tillage that our riches are truly estimated
Cicero Paradox vi 3
My real need does not so wholly take up all I have that Fortune has not
whereon to fasten her teeth without biting to the quick  My presence
heedless and ignorant as it is does me great service in my domestic
affairs I employ myself in them but it goes against the hair finding
that I have this in my house that though I burn my candle at one end by
myself the other is not spared
Journeys do me no harm but only by their expense which is great and
more than I am well able to bear being always wont to travel with not
only a necessary but a handsome equipage I must make them so much
shorter and fewer I spend therein but the froth and what I have
reserved for such uses delaying and deferring my motion till that be
ready  I will not that the pleasure of going abroad spoil the pleasure
of being retired at home on the contrary I intend they shall nourish
and favour one another  Fortune has assisted me in this that since my
principal profession in this life was to live at ease and rather idly
than busily she has deprived me of the necessity of growing rich to
provide for the multitude of my heirs  If there be not enough for one
of that whereof I had so plentifully enough at his peril be it his
imprudence will not deserve that I should wish him any more  And every
one according to the example of Phocion provides sufficiently for his
children who so provides for them as to leave them as much as was left
him  I should by no means like Crates way  He left his money in the
hands of a banker with this conditionthat if his children were fools
he should then give it to them if wise he should then distribute it to
the most foolish of the people as if fools for being less capable of
living without riches were more capable of using them
At all events the damage occasioned by my absence seems not to deserve
so long as I am able to support it that I should waive the occasions of
diverting myself by that troublesome assistance
There is always something that goes amiss  The affairs one while of one
house and then of another tear you to pieces you pry into everything
too near your perspicacity hurts you here as well as in other things
I steal away from occasions of vexing myself and turn from the knowledge
of things that go amiss and yet I cannot so order it but that every
hour I jostle against something or other that displeases me and the
tricks that they most conceal from me are those that I the soonest come
to know some there are that not to make matters worse a man must
himself help to conceal  Vain vexations vain sometimes but always
vexations  The smallest and slightest impediments are the most piercing
and as little letters most tire the eyes so do little affairs most
disturb us  The rout of little ills more offend than one how great
soever  By how much domestic thorns are numerous and slight by so much
they prick deeper and without warning easily surprising us when least we
suspect them
Now Homer shews us clearly enough how surprise gives the advantage
who represents Ulysses weeping at the death of his dog and not
weeping at the tears of his mother the first accident trivial as
it was got the better of him coming upon him quite unexpectedly
he sustained the second though more potent because he was prepared
for it  Tis light occasions that humble our lives
I am no philosopher evils oppress me according to their weight and they
weigh as much according to the form as the matter and very often more
If I have therein more perspicacity than the vulgar I have also more
patience in short they weigh with me if they do not hurt me  Life is
a tender thing and easily molested  Since my age has made me grow more
pensive and morose
Nemo enim resistit sibi cum caeperit impelli
For no man resists himself when he has begun to be driven
forwardSeneca Ep 13
for the most trivial cause imaginable I irritate that humour which
afterwards nourishes and exasperates itself of its own motion attracting
and heaping up matter upon matter whereon to feed
Stillicidi casus lapidem cavat
The ever falling drop hollows out a stoneLucretius i 314
these continual tricklings consume and ulcerate me  Ordinary
inconveniences are never light they are continual and inseparable
especially when they spring from the members of a family continual and
inseparable  When I consider my affairs at distance and in gross I
find because perhaps my memory is none of the best that they have gone
on hitherto improving beyond my reason or expectation my revenue seems
greater than it is its prosperity betrays me but when I pry more
narrowly into the business and see how all things go
Tum vero in curas animum diducimus omnes
Indeed we lead the mind into all sorts of cares
AEneid v 720
I have a thousand things to desire and to fear  To give them quite over
is very easy for me to do but to look after them without trouble is
very hard  Tis a miserable thing to be in a place where everything you
see employs and concerns you and I fancy that I more cheerfully enjoy
the pleasures of another mans house and with greater and a purer
relish than those of my own  Diogenes answered according to my humour
him who asked him what sort of wine he liked the best That of another
said heDiogenes Laertius vi 54
My father took a delight in building at Montaigne where he was born and
in all the government of domestic affairs I love to follow his example
and rules and I shall engage those who are to succeed me as much as in
me lies to do the same  Could I do better for him I would and am
proud that his will is still performing and acting by me  God forbid
that in my hands I should ever suffer any image of life that I am able
to render to so good a father to fail  And wherever I have taken in
hand to strengthen some old foundations of walls and to repair some
ruinous buildings in earnest I have done it more out of respect to his
design than my own satisfaction and am angry at myself that I have not
proceeded further to finish the beginnings he left in his house and so
much the more because I am very likely to be the last possessor of my
race and to give the last hand to it  For as to my own particular
application neither the pleasure of building which they say is so
bewitching nor hunting nor gardens nor the other pleasures of a
retired life can much amuse me  And tis what I am angry at myself for
as I am for all other opinions that are incommodious to me which I would
not so much care to have vigorous and learned as I would have them easy
and convenient for life they are true and sound enough if they are
useful and pleasing  Such as hear me declare my ignorance in husbandry
whisper in my ear that it is disdain and that I neglect to know its
instruments its seasons its order how they dress my vines how they
graft and to know the names and forms of herbs and fruits and the
preparing the meat on which I live the names and prices of the stuffs I
wear because say they I have set my heart upon some higher knowledge
they kill me in saying so  It is not disdain it is folly and rather
stupidity than glory I had rather be a good horseman than a good
logician
Quin to aliquid saltem potius quorum indiget usus
Viminibus mollique paras detexere junco
Dost thou not rather do something which is required and make
osier and reed basketVirgil Eclog ii 71
We occupy our thoughts about the general and about universal causes and
conducts which will very well carry on themselves without our care and
leave our own business at random and Michael much more our concern than
man  Now I am indeed for the most part at home but I would be there
better pleased than anywhere else
Sit meae sedes utinam senectae
Sit modus lasso maris et viarum

I know not whether or no I shall bring it about  I could wish that
instead of some other member of his succession my father had resigned to
me the passionate affection he had in his old age to his household
affairs he was happy in that he could accommodate his desires to his
fortune and satisfy himself with what he had political philosophy may
to much purpose condemn the meanness and sterility of my employment if I
can once come to relish it as he did  I am of opinion that the most
honourable calling is to serve the public and to be useful to many
Fructus enim ingenii et virtutis omnisque praestantiae
tum maximus capitur quum in proximum quemque confertur

excellence is experienced when they are conferred on some one

for myself I disclaim it partly out of conscience for where I see the
weight that lies upon such employments I perceive also the little means
I have to supply it and Plato a master in all political government
himself nevertheless took care to abstain from it and partly out of
cowardice  I content myself with enjoying the world without bustle
onlyto live an excusable life and such as may neither be a burden to
myself nor to any other
Never did any man more fully and feebly suffer himself to be governed by
a third person than I should do had I any one to whom to entrust myself
One of my wishes at this time should be to have a soninlaw that knew
handsomely how to cherish my old age and to rock it asleep into whose
hands I might deposit in full sovereignty the management and use of all
my goods that he might dispose of them as I do and get by them what I
get provided that he on his part were truly acknowledging and a friend
But we live in a world where loyalty of ones own children is unknown
He who has the charge of my purse in his travels has it purely and
without control he could cheat me thoroughly if he came to reckoning
and if he is not a devil I oblige him to deal faithfully with me by so
entire a trust
Multi fallere do cuerunt dum timent falli
et aliis jus peccandi suspicando fecerunt
Many have taught others to deceive while they fear to be
deceived and by suspecting them have given them a title to do
illSeneca Epist 3
The most common security I take of my people is ignorance I never
presume any to be vicious till I have first found them so and repose the
most confidence in the younger sort that I think are least spoiled by
ill example  I had rather be told at two months end that I have spent
four hundred crowns than to have my ears battered every night with
three five seven and I have been in this way as little robbed as
another  It is true I am willing enough not to see it I in some sort
purposely harbour a kind of perplexed uncertain knowledge of my money
up to a certain point I am content to doubt  One must leave a little
room for the infidelity or indiscretion of a servant if you have left
enough in gross to do your business let the overplus of Fortunes
liberality run a little more freely at her mercy tis the gleaners
portion  After all I do not so much value the fidelity of my people as
I contemn their injury  What a mean and ridiculous thing it is for a man
to study his money to delight in handling and telling it over and over
again  Tis by this avarice makes its approaches
In eighteen years that I have had my estate in my own hands I could
never prevail with myself either to read over my deeds or examine my
principal affairs which ought of necessity to pass under my knowledge
and inspection  Tis not a philosophical disdain of worldly and
transitory things my taste is not purified to that degree and I value
them at as great a rate at least as they are worth but tis in truth
an inexcusable and childish laziness and negligence  What would I not
rather do than read a contract  or than as a slave to my own business
tumble over those dusty writings  or which is worse those of another
man as so many do nowadays to get money  I grudge nothing but care and
trouble and endeavour nothing so much as to be careless and at ease
I had been much fitter I believe could it have been without obligation
and servitude to have lived upon another mans fortune than my own and
indeed I do not know when I examine it nearer whether according to my
humour what I have to suffer from my affairs and servants has not in it
something more abject troublesome and tormenting than there would be in
serving a man better born than myself who would govern me with a gentle
rein and a little at my own case
Servitus obedientia est fracti animi et abjecti
arbitrio carentis suo
Servitude is the obedience of a subdued and abject mind wanting
its own free willCicero Paradox V I
Crates did worse who threw himself into the liberty of poverty only to
rid himself of the inconveniences and cares of his house  This is what I
would not do I hate poverty equally with pain but I could be content to
change the kind of life I live for another that was humbler and less
chargeable
When absent from home I divest myself of all these thoughts and should
be less concerned for the ruin of a tower than I am when present at
the fall of a tile  My mind is easily composed at distance but suffers
as much as that of the meanest peasant when I am at home the reins of my
bridle being wrongly put on or a strap flapping against my leg will
keep me out of humour a day together  I raise my courage well enough
against inconveniences lift up my eyes I cannot
Sensus o superi sensus
The senses O ye gods the senses
I am at home responsible for whatever goes amiss  Few masters I speak
of those of medium condition such as mine and if there be any such
they are more happy can rely so much upon another but that the greatest
part of the burden will lie upon their own shoulders  This takes much
from my grace in entertaining visitors so that I have peradventure
detained some rather out of expectation of a good dinner than by my own
behaviour and lose much of the pleasure I ought to reap at my own house
from the visitation and assembling of my friends  The most ridiculous
carriage of a gentleman in his own house is to see him bustling about
the business of the place whispering one servant and looking an angry
look at another it ought insensibly to slide along and to represent an
ordinary current and I think it unhandsome to talk much to our guests of
their entertainment whether by way of bragging or excuse  I love order
and cleanliness
Et cantharus et lanx
Ostendunt mihi me
The dishes and the glasses shew me my own reflection
Horace Ep i 5 23
more than abundance and at home have an exact regard to necessity
little to outward show  If a footman falls to cuffs at another mans
house or stumble and throw a dish before him as he is carrying it up
you only laugh and make a jest ont you sleep whilst the master of the
house is arranging a bill of fare with his steward for your morrows
entertainment  I speak according as I do myself quite appreciating
nevertheless good husbandry in general and how pleasant quiet and
prosperous household management carried regularly on is to some
natures and not wishing to fasten my own errors and inconveniences to
the thing nor to give Plato the lie who looks upon it as the most
pleasant employment to every one to do his particular affairs without
wrong to another
When I travel I have nothing to care for but myself and the laying out
my money which is disposed of by one single precept too many things are
required to the raking it together in that I understand nothing in
spending I understand a little and how to give some show to my expense
which is indeed its principal use but I rely too ambitiously upon it
which renders it unequal and difform and moreover immoderate in both
the one and the other aspect if it makes a show if it serve the turn
I indiscreetly let it run and as indiscreetly tie up my pursestrings
if it does not shine and does not please me  Whatever it be whether
art or nature that imprints in us the condition of living by reference
to others it does us much more harm than good we deprive ourselves of
our own utilities to accommodate appearances to the common opinion
we care not so much what our being is as to us and in reality as what
it is to the public observation  Even the properties of the mind and
wisdom itself seem fruitless to us if only enjoyed by ourselves and if
it produce not itself to the view and approbation of others  There is a
sort of men whose gold runs in streams underground imperceptibly others
expose it all in plates and branches so that to the one a liard is worth
a crown and to the others the inverse the world esteeming its use and
value according to the show  All overnice solicitude about riches
smells of avarice even the very disposing of it with a too systematic
and artificial liberality is not worth a painful superintendence and
solicitude he that will order his expense to just so much makes it too
pinched and narrow  The keeping or spending are of themselves
indifferent things and receive no colour of good or ill but according
to the application of the will
The other cause that tempts me out to these journeys is inaptitude for
the present manners in our state  I could easily console myself for this
corruption in regard to the public interest
Pejoraque saecula ferri
Temporibus quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa
Nomen et a nullo posuit natura metallo
And worse than the iron ages for whose crimes there is no
similitude in any of Natures metalsJuvenal xiii 28
but not to my own  I am in particular too much oppressed by them for
in my neighbourhood we are of late by the long licence of our civil
wars grown old in so riotous a form of state
Quippe ubi fas versum atque nefas
Where wrong and right have changed places
Virgil Georg i 504
that in earnest tis a wonder how it can subsist

In fine I see by our example that the society of men is maintained and
held together at what price soever in what condition soever they are
placed they still close and stick together both moving and in heaps as
ill united bodies that shuffled together without order find of
themselves a means to unite and settle often better than they could have
been disposed by art  King Philip mustered up a rabble of the most
wicked and incorrigible rascals he could pick out and put them all
together into a city he had caused to be built for that purpose which
bore their name I believe that they even from vices themselves erected
a government amongst them and a commodious and just society  I see not
one action or three or a hundred but manners in common and received
use so ferocious especially in inhumanity and treachery which are to
me the worst of all vices that I have not the heart to think of them
without horror and almost as much admire as I detest them the exercise
of these signal villainies carries with it as great signs of vigour and
force of soul as of error and disorder  Necessity reconciles and brings
men together and this accidental connection afterwards forms itself into
laws for there have been such as savage as any human opinion could
conceive who nevertheless have maintained their body with as much
health and length of life as any Plato or Aristotle could invent  And
certainly all these descriptions of polities feigned by art are found
to be ridiculous and unfit to be put in practice
These great and tedious debates about the best form of society and the
most commodious rules to bind us are debates only proper for the
exercise of our wits as in the arts there are several subjects which
have their being in agitation and controversy and have no life but
there  Such an idea of government might be of some value in a new world
but we take a world already made and formed to certain customs we do
not beget it as Pyrrha or Cadmus did  By what means soever we may have
the privilege to redress and reform it anew we can hardly writhe it from
its wonted bent but we shall break all  Solon being asked whether he
had established the best laws he could for the Athenians Yes said he
of those they would have received  Varro excuses himself after the
same manner that if he were to begin to write of religion he would say
what he believed but seeing it was already received he would write
rather according to use than nature
Not according to opinion but in truth and reality the best and most
excellent government for every nation is that under which it is
maintained its form and essential convenience depend upon custom
We are apt to be displeased at the present condition but I
nevertheless maintain that to desire command in a fewan oligarchy
in a republic or another sort of government in monarchy than that
already established is both vice and folly
Ayme lestat tel que to le veois estre
Sil est royal ayme la royaute
Sil est de peu ou biers communaute
Ayme laussi car Dieu ty a faict naistre
Love the government such as you see it to be  If it be royal
love royalty if it is a republic of any sort still love it for
God himself created thee therein
So wrote the good Monsieur de Pibrac whom we have lately lost a man of
so excellent a wit such sound opinions and such gentle manners  This
loss and that at the same time we have had of Monsieur de Foix are of
so great importance to the crown that I do not know whether there is
another couple in France worthy to supply the places of these two Gascons
in sincerity and wisdom in the council of our kings  They were both
variously great men and certainly according to the age rare and great
each of them in his kind but what destiny was it that placed them in
these times men so remote from and so disproportioned to our corruption
and intestine tumults
Nothing presses so hard upon a state as innovation change only gives
form to injustice and tyranny  When any piece is loosened it may be
proper to stay it one may take care that the alteration and corruption
natural to all things do not carry us too far from our beginnings and
principles but to undertake to found so great a mass anew and to change
the foundations of so vast a building is for them to do who to make
clean efface who reform particular defects by an universal confusion
and cure diseases by death
Non tam commutandarum quam evertendarum rerum cupidi
Not so desirous of changing as of overthrowing things
Cicero De Offic ii i
The world is unapt to be cured and so impatient of anything that presses
it that it thinks of nothing but disengaging itself at what price
soever  We see by a thousand examples that it ordinarily cures itself
to its cost  The discharge of a present evil is no cure if there be not
a general amendment of condition  The surgeons end is not only to cut
away the dead flesh that is but the progress of his cure he has a care
over and above to fill up the wound with better and more natural flesh
and to restore the member to its due state  Whoever only proposes to
himself to remove that which offends him falls short for good does not
necessarily succeed evil another evil may succeed and a worse as it
happened to Caesars murderers who brought the republic to such a pass
that they had reason to repent the meddling with the matter  The same
has since happened to several others even down to our own times the
French my contemporaries know it well enough  All great mutations
shake and disorder a state
Whoever would look direct at a cure and well consider of it before he
began would be very willing to withdraw his hands from meddling in it
Pacuvius Calavius corrected the vice of this proceeding by a notable
example  His fellowcitizens were in mutiny against their magistrates
he being a man of great authority in the city of Capua found means one
day to shut up the Senators in the palace and calling the people
together in the marketplace there told them that the day was now come
wherein at full liberty they might revenge themselves on the tyrants by
whom they had been so long oppressed and whom he had now all alone and
unarmed at his mercy  He then advised that they should call these out
one by one by lot and should individually determine as to each causing
whatever should be decreed to be immediately executed with this proviso
that they should at the same time depute some honest man in the place
of him who was condemned to the end there might be no vacancy in the
Senate  They had no sooner heard the name of one senator but a great cry
of universal dislike was raised up against him  I see says Pacuvius
that we must put him out he is a wicked fellow let us look out a good
