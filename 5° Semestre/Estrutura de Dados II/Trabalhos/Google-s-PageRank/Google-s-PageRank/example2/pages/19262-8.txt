sharppointed vigorous leaf of the Greeks Its lobes are divided into
three or five tines each sharp at the tip its centre lines radiating
from a central stem bend like flames its surfaces are concave with
deep V cutting and it has one very marked peculiarity that is that as
far as possible no tine is left displayed alone on the ground but the
tip of each is made to touch either the tip of a neighboring tine or the
ribbon or moulding bounding the space in which the ornament occurs The
tines are of nearly equal size throughout and the spaces of ground left
by the ornament are also of comparatively equal size and if possible
symmetrically grouped The one almost universal moulding is decorated
with acanthus units and the capitals have acanthus leaves around their
bells These caps are of two types One that is manifestly an
adaptation of a classic cap is a union of an Ionic and a Corinthian or
at other times of a Roman Doric and a Corinthian capital The other is
peculiar to Byzantine work and is that shown in Plates XXI to XXIV in
the last number This cap as at S Vitale is often supplemented by
another plainer cap above The lower cap has its faces decorated with
scrolls acanthus wreaths etc and usually the corners are
strengthened with a decorative unit leaf or other motive
The difference between the Byzantine and the Romanesque arises from the
differences of the races and their environments The art of seaport
towns when Commerce was most largely carried on by sea much more
nearly resembled the art of some great commercial centre on the
seaboard than it did that of its own neighbors inland
The art of the seaboard cities in Europe was then for many years a
borrowed art from the East as their people were to great extent Eastern
colonists It was carried on with a full knowledge of constructive
methods and a facility in obtaining materials that the inland towns did
not possess and in consequence it is along the seaboard that is to be
found the persistence of the Byzantine influence On the other hand the
interior was peopled by descendants of Ostrogothic tribes mingling with
numberless local peoples Whatever they touch is necessarily crude at
first but constantly gaining as they gain facility in working A
precedent of some kind they must have and they find it close at hand in
the Roman basilicas Uncertain from the result of woful experiments of
arches of great span they pack their columns close together and
surmount them with sturdy little arches that have scarcely any thrust
This arcade of heavy columns carrying absurdly disproportionate arches
is their only motive and applied inside between aisles and nave and
outside in successive stories rising one above another As the masons
begin better to understand their art the span of the arch increases
though a large arch for some time does duty merely as a discharging
arch and has smaller arches beneath and within it The capitals at
first crude imitations of classic prototypes soon become the field for
the grotesque imagination of the workmen and each differs from the
other and is a mass of light and shade shot with all sorts of uncouth
fancies Wherever for some constructive reason a column is omitted
against a wall the capital becomes a corbel carrying the arches In
many cases the corbels alone are used and an arcaded corbel course
becomes the favorite termination of a wall in the place of a classic
entablature Finally the arches are omitted and the corbels alone
support the eaves
It will be noticed that while the Byzantine decorated the interior of
the churches the Romanesque builder merely constructed the interior and
wrought out the most of his design upon the facade As a large arch was
to him for a long time a tour de force he naturally beautified the
necessarily large entrance and the beginning of the development of the
beautiful Gothic portals is seen in the early Romanesque churches
The Romanesque is an architecture of inertia with arches heavily
weighted by great masses of wall and with broadly contrasting masses of
light and shade It does not depend for its effect upon intellectual
quality beyond a rigorous sense of simplicity or upon refinement of
conception or detail but rather upon size picturesque mass and
staccato light and shade The proportion of capital to column in
quantity of surface was very slight The proportion of voussoirs to
arches naturally depended upon the size of the archlarge voussoirs to
large arches small voussoirs to small arches Columns were only grouped
around piers and on either side of openings and lastly the natural
development of the column in Romanesque work was toward
attenuationthe later and the better the work the more slender became
the columns until at last they were merged into the Gothic
multiplecolumned piers The carving upon the archmouldings is to a
great extent geometric consisting of numerous facets cut in the stone
lozenges etc the socalled dogtooth moulding is a very favorite form
of decoration All these carved mouldings were picked out in color
usually in red and green The acanthus in the Romanesque has lost much
of its vigor is flat heavytipped roundedged and scratched with
Vcuts and the vine is the leaf preferred by designers Frequently
masses of wall are cut in geometric diaper patterns also touched with
color Borders are not broad and circular forms except in the arches
are seldom used Romanesque was a barbaric art at the best and has the
usual virtue of the barbariana directness of attack at the problem in
hand and a simplicity in treating it which is invigorating to see

Illustration XXVI Window in the Church of S Teresia Trani Italy

WINDOWS IN THE CHURCH OF S TERESIA TRANI ITALY
These two windows have very little to suggest Byzantine influence in
their design The form and detail are essentially Romanesque although
there is a certain crispness and piquancy of treatment in the first
Plate XXV which belongs to the Byzantine work
Illustration XXVII Window in the Facade of the Basilica at Altamura
Italy
XXVII
WINDOW IN THE FACADE OF THE BASILICA AT ALTAMURA ITALY
The employment of grotesque beasts supporting the columns at each side
of this window is a very common device in the Italian Romanesque work
The use of a reversed capital in place of a base for the centre column
is also a peculiar treatment frequently found in Romanesque work

TRIFORIUM WINDOW IN THE CHURCH OF S GREGORIO BARI ITALY
The Byzantine architects used pierced stonework with great effect both
in exterior and interior detail The examples here shown are rather
crude but effective in the relative scale of parts
Illustration XXX Window in the Apse of the Cathedral Bari Italy

WINDOW IN THE APSE OF THE CATHEDRAL BARI ITALY
The ornament about this window especially that in the long panel below
it and upon the cyma of the soffit above is Byzantine in character
while the columns with the exception of the capital of the one at the
left are much more Romanesque

In this case the beautiful and delicate Byzantine leafage can be seen on

preceding examples there is a curious mixture of the two styles

The judges in the recent competition for the Rotch Travelling
Scholarship Messrs Cass Gilbert George B Post and Frank Miles Day
have awarded the scholarship to William S Aldrich Mr Aldrich has
taken the examinations this year for the first time although several of
his unsuccessful rivals for the honor have entered before in years past
He has been for some time in the office of Mr C H Blackall and has
been engaged upon important work such as the new Tremont Temple which
is now approaching completion
In 1884 he entered the Department of Architecture at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and completed the two years special course in
1887 and then went to the office of Mr John Calvin Stevens in
Portland Me He afterwards worked in the Boston office of McKim Mead
White and in the office of Peabody  Stearns where he was engaged upon
the drawings for the buildings at the Worlds Fair As will be seen he
has had a varied experience and is well equipped to make the best use of
his opportunities for the next two years
It has been the custom in recent years with the winners of the
scholarship to delay their departure until midsummer or early fall but
Mr Aldrich proposes to start in June His plan of work has not yet been
entirely fixed but he will probably spend a large part of his time in
Italy working in conjunction with the American atelier at Rome
The three other scholarships in which the same problem in design was
employed have also been awarded For the McKim Fellowship of Columbia
College ten designs were submitted The award was made to Mr John
Russell Pope of New York a graduate from the school in the class of
1894 The Roman Scholarship was also awarded to Mr Pope In the
competition for the latter twentythree designs were entered and
besides the first award honorable mention was given to Mr Henry E
Emery of Nyack N Y Mr Fellows of Chicago and Mr Bossange and Mr
Ayres of New York graduates of Columbia College and to Mr Percy Ash
of Philadelphia
In the University of Pennsylvania Scholarship in Architecture there were
six competitors and the award was made to Mr Percy Ash a graduate of
the University Mr Ash has also had several years practical experience
in the best offices of Philadelphia such as those of Cope  Stewardson
and Frank Miles Day  Bro
Mr H L Duhring Jr of the Senior class in the University was given
second place
The American Architect in an interesting notice of the recent
exhibition of the Boston Society of Architects and Boston Architectural
Club takes the occasion to comment unfavorably upon the disfigurement
of the catalogue by advertisements which it says are most excellent
things in their proper place but wholly out of place in an exhibition
catalogue Why this is so it is hard to see unless the Architect
believes that there is not advertising enough to go round and that it
should all be reserved for the trade and professional papers At all
events this is kicking against the pricks for it is well known that
the expenses of such exhibitions cannot be met without some outside
assistance and the most feasible plan that has been found for making
both ends meet is to interest the dealers in materials used in the
buildings represented in the exhibitions As these dealers are seldom
named on the drawings exhibited it seems proper that some return should
be made for their most valuable assistance without which the exhibition
would not be possible
The Architect further says The position taken by the St Louis
Chapter A I A was the proper and dignified one and it ought to be
followed elsewhere The catalogue of their recent exhibition although a
much more costly one than either the Boston or the League catalogue
contains not a line of advertising matter This is certainly an amusing
misstatement Instead of not a line this catalogue has more space
devoted to advertising than any of the others mentioned What it would
have been without its sixtyfour pages of advertising yielding an
income of at least 50 a page we leave others to figure out Some of
these pages we should prefer to see treated differently as they do
detract from the illustrations which they face and they are sprinkled
full of waterclosets radiators bathtubs and various other building
appliances not especially artistic in their suggestiveness Still there
is considerable taste and care evinced in the arrangement of many of the
pages and they are well printed on good paper Possibly this accounts
for the failure of the Architect to recognize them as advertisements
The dignified course it seems to us is that followed by the committee
of the Boston exhibition In this case a certain number of pages was
reserved in the catalogue to be devoted to advertising and the houses
to be represented were given to understand that all would be treated
alike No cuts would be used and the pages would all be set in type of
uniform style thus insuring a desirable ensemble We think that the
advertising when well presented adds to rather than detracts from the
interest of a catalogue Our only desire is to see it done in good
taste The display of plumbing apparatus and all manner of building
appliances we do not consider in good taste in this place
The secretaries of a number of the architectural clubs have very kindly
responded to our request for notices and reports of their meetings and
proceedings and we are pleased to be able to give short reports of such
occurrences as are of general interest There are some clubs however
from whom we have not yet heard and we would suggest that it will be a
help to all concerned if the secretaries of all the architectural clubs
will furnish us with short accounts of their regular meetings and of any
other occasions of importance We shall be pleased also to publish any
correspondence which will in any way further the interests of these
organizations We shall be glad to have THE BROCHURE SERIES considered
as the organ of communication between the various clubs and will place
our services at their command
Books
Examples of Colonial Architecture in Charleston S C and Savannah
Ga Compiled photographed and published by Edward A Crane and E E
Soderholtz Boston Architectural Club Boston 50 plates 11 x 14
1250
How much the revival of the classic influence of the early colonial and
the immediately succeeding period is going to prevail in the
establishment of a distinctive American style of architecture it is now
difficult or indeed impossible to determine but at all events the
reaction from the Queen Anne vagaries of ten years ago to the more
severe mass and chaste detail of the recent socalled colonial houses is
a step in the right direction and we have much to be thankful for in
the improvement which this tendency has wrought in our recent domestic
architecture Beautiful and admirable as some of the recent examples of
this work are very few show the subtle appreciation of design to be
found in many of the older buildings which until the last year or two
have been looked upon as merely the outgrown and castoff work of an age
much less refined than our own
With the very general adoption of this style there has been an
increased interest in the few remaining fine old examples which are
scattered over the Eastern and Middle States and the best of these are
now familiar to architects
Few however know anything of the development of this style in the
Southern States and the work now before us will be a revelation to
those who have not visited the neighborhood of Charleston and Savannah
A large proportion of the plates is devoted to Charleston which owes
its wealth and in fact the greater part of its existence to the
prosperous planters of former days who made the city a winter resort
The most notable house illustrated in the work is the William Bull
Pringle house built by Miles Brewton in 1760 It has long been famous
as one of the finest houses in the country Josiah Quincy who was
entertained by its first owner speaks in enthusiastic terms of its
beauty and the charm of its surroundings Fourteen plates are devoted to
illustrating its various features The twostory portico with a Doric
order below and Ionic above relieved against the brick front laid in
Flemish bond the simple but welldesigned iron fence flanked on either
side by a wall with massive brick posts covered with plaster and all
overgrown with a tangle of foliage make up a fascinating picture The
view of the side gateway and a group of darky boys is wonderfully
picturesque besides being very suggestive as an architectural fragment
The detail is delicate and refined but as a rule lacks the force and
vitality of the Northern work of the same period The interior detail
shows a marked French influence especially in the ceilings mantels
and stairway The drawingroom of which a double plate is given is
probably without doubt the finest colonial room in the country and is
certainly a fine piece of design all through
One feature in planning which seems to be peculiar to this region as it
is not found in the houses at the North is the location of the
drawingroom which is here on the second floor usually extending
entirely across the front of the house There is seldom however any
indication of this in the facade by a distinctive treatment of the
second story But the effect is seen in the interior by the greater
importance naturally given to the staircase hall
The Gibbs house built in 1752 which is shown by several plates is
also very attractive The two interior doorways shown on one plate are
among the most refined that we can remember
The entrance and staircase hall of the Gov Bennett house will bear
comparison with anything of its class to be found and the plates
showing it will be of especial value for interior work
The Bull house is of a type apparently common in the older work of this
region It is square and covered with a hip roof The front is divided
into three bays the centre and wider one crowned with a low gable or
pediment The main floor is high leaving a basement below and no
cellar and the front door an illustration of which we give herewith
is reached by a double flight of steps protected by an iron railing
Many of the houses are provided with high fences and massive gateposts
A number of the plates give fine examples of these and several very
interesting pieces of iron work
Illustration Doorway to the Bull House Charleston
Of the churches St Michaels and St Philips in Charleston are
selected The former was built in 1760 and is attributed to the English
architect Gibbs who is also credited with the old Archdale house with
how good authority we do not know
On the whole the choice of material is excellent There is a large
number of plates of detail which for architects use are always the most
valuable and the work of the photographer and printer has been done
unusually well
Catalogue of the Joint Exhibition of the Boston Society of Architects
and the Boston Architectural Club April 15 to 21 1895 Boston
Published for the exhibition by Bates  Guild 96 pp 36 illustrations
35 cents
A continuation of the general subject of exhibition catalogues touched
upon in our last issue as far as it relates to the catalogue of the
Boston Architectural Exhibition The exhibition itself is quite small
comparatively speaking including only three hundred and twentyfive
numbers but as the illustrations in the catalogue show is widely
representative and of a high grade of excellence The contributions are
very largely confined to members of the two societies under whose
management the exhibition is held This tends to give a somewhat local
character to the exhibition as a whole Still there is a sufficient
number of important contributions from outside to make a quite
respectable showing
The selection of illustrations the only ground upon which there is
excuse for reviewing the publication is unquestionably good There are
thirtysix in all covering a wide range of subjects treated in a
variety of ways The reproductions are unusually good and the book is
neatly and well printed on good paper The cover designed by Mr George
G Will is especially attractive and good in design
Club Notes
Recruits in the already very considerable list of architectural clubs
are still coming to the front The latest to be heard from is the
Architectural Club of San Francisco which was organized on Feb 26 with
fourteen members some of whom were members of the old Sketch Club of
San Francisco It is growing in membership and gives promise of a
bright future Rooms have been secured in the Menisini Building 231
Post Street Meetings are held on the first Monday of each month and a
paper is read and the designs submitted in the monthly competitions are
criticised and the awards announced The first club exhibition will be
held April 26 Mr Loring P Rixford Room 24 Menisini Building 231
Post Street San Francisco is secretary
Brochure Series Competitions
From time to time as opportunity offers competitions in design will be
conducted by THE BROCHURE SERIES An upright or cabinet piano case the
subject of the first one badly needs the attention of good designers
The Henry F Miller  Sons Piano Company of Boston have for several
years made steady advancement in the artistic qualities of their piano
cases They have equipped their factory with a view to special work and
have unusually good facilities for getting out pianos to order carrying
out architects sketches or those of their own designers to harmonize
with different styles of interior decoration
It is their idea to encourage the special designing of piano cases and
to this end they have placed with the publishers fifty dollars to be
divided into prizes for such designs Only sketches will be required
their object being not to use the designs further than to publish the
best but to get designers to give a little attention to this particular
problem and so do a little towards creating an interest in the better
design of piano cases Full particulars including a structural diagram
and a statement of the technical requirements and limitations will be
announced in our next issue
Personal
As usual at this season a number of architects and draughtsmen are
planning to go abroad some for only a few months and others for a
longer time Among these are Messrs H T Pratt Matthew Sullivan
C D Maginnis and H C Dunham of Boston and E K Taylor and H L
Jones of New York
