breadth of nostril His teeth were wide apart and his smile was broad
and constant Not that Emmy Lou could have told all this She only knew
that to her the knowledge of the little boy concerning the things
peculiar to the Primer World seemed limitless
And now the little boy was beckoning Emmy Lou She did not know him but
neither did she know any of the seventy other little boys and girls
making the Primer Class
Because of a popular prejudice against whoopingcough Emmy Lou had not
entered the Primer Class until late When she arrived the seventy
little boys and girls were well along in Alphabetical lore having long
since passed the a b c of initiation and become glibly eloquent to a
point where the l m n o p slipped off their tongues with the liquid
ease of repetition and familiarity
But Emmy Lou can catch up said Emmy Lous Aunt Cordelia a plump and
cheery lady beaming with optimistic placidity upon the infant populace
seated in parallel rows at desks before her
Miss Clara the teacher lacked Aunt Cordelias optimism also her
plumpness No doubt she can agreed Miss Clara politely but without
enthusiasm Miss Clara had stepped from the graduating rostrum to the
schoolroom platform and she had been there some years And when one has
been there some years and is already battling with seventy little boys
and girls one cannot greet the advent of a seventyfirst with acclaim
Even the fact that ones hair is red is not an always sure indication
that ones temperament is sanguine also
So in answer to Aunt Cordelia Miss Clara replied politely but without
enthusiasm No doubt she can
Then Aunt Cordelia went and Miss Clara gave Emmy Lou a desk And Miss
Clara then rapping sharply and calling some small delinquent to order
Emmy Lous heart sank within her
Now Miss Claras tones were tart because she did not know what to do
with this late comer In a class of seventy spare time is not offering
for the bringing up of the backward The way of the Primer teacher was
not made easy in a public school of twentyfive years ago
So Miss Clara told the new pupil to copy digits
Now what digits were Emmy Lou had no idea but being shown them on the
blackboard she copied them diligently And as the time went on Emmy
Lou went on copying digits And her one endeavor being to avoid the
notice of Miss Clara it happened the needs of Emmy Lou were frequently
lost sight of in the more assertive claims of the seventy
Emmy Lou was not catching up and it was January
But today was to be different The little boy was nodding and
beckoning So far the seventy had left Emmy Lou alone As a general
thing the herd crowds toward the leaders and the laggard brings up the
rear alone
But today the little boy was beckoning Emmy Lou looked up Emmy Lou
was pinkcheeked and chubby and in her heart there was no guile There
was an ease and swagger about the little boy And he always knew when to
stand up and what for Emmy Lou more than once had failed to stand up
and Miss Claras reminder had been sharp It was when a bell rang one
must stand up But what for Emmy Lou never knew until after the
others began to do it
But the little boy always knew Emmy Lou had heard him too out on the
bench glibly tell Miss Clara about the mat and a bat and a black rat
Today he stood forth with confidence and told about a fat hen Emmy Lou
was glad to have the little boy beckon her
And in her heart there was no guile That the little boy should be
holding out an end of a severed indiarubber band and inviting her to
take it was no stranger than other things happening in the Primer World
every day
The very manner of the infant classification breathed mystery the sheep
from the goats so to speak the little girls all one side the central
aisle the little boys all the otherand to overstep the line of
demarcation a thing too dreadful to contemplate
Many things were strange That one must get up suddenly when a bell
rang was strange
And to copy digits until ones chubby fingers tightly gripping the
pencil ached and then to be expected to take a sponge and wash those
digits off was strange
And to be told crossly to sit down was bewildering when in answer to
c a t one said Pussy And yet there was Pussy washing her face on
the chart and Miss Claras pointer pointing to her
So when the little boy held out the rubber band across the aisle Emmy
Lou took the proffered end
At this the little boy slid back into his desk holding to his end At
the critical moment of elongation the little boy let go And the
property of elasticity is to rebound
Emmy Lous heart stood still Then it swelled But in her filling eyes
there was no suspicion only hurt And even while a tear splashed down
and falling upon the laboriously copied digits wrought havoc she
smiled bravely across at the little boy It would have made the little
boy feel bad to know how it hurt So Emmy Lou winked bravely and smiled
Whereupon the little boy wheeled about suddenly and fell to copying
digits furiously Nor did he look Emmy Lous way only drove his pencil
into his slate with a fervor that made Miss Clara rap sharply on her
desk
Illustration Emmy Lou winked bravely and smiled
Emmy Lou wondered if the little boy was mad One would think it had
stung the little boy and not her But since he was not looking she felt
free to let her little fist seek her mouth for comfort
Nor did Emmy Lou dream that across the aisle remorse was eating into
a little boys soul Or that along with remorse there went the image
of one Emmy Lou defenceless pinkcheeked and smiling bravely
The next morning Emmy Lou was early She was always early Since
entering the Primer Class breakfast had lost its savor to Emmy Lou in
the terror of being late
But this morning the little boy was there before her Hitherto his tardy
and clattering arrival had been a daily happening provocative of
accents sharp and energetic from Miss Clara
But this morning he was at his desk copying from his Primer on to his
slate The easy ostentatious way in which he glanced from slate to book
was not lost upon Emmy Lou who lost her place whenever her eyes left
the rows of digits upon the blackboard
Emmy Lou watched the performance And the little boys pencil drove with
furious ease and its path was marked with flourishes Emmy Lou never
dreamed that it was because she was watching that the little boy was
moved to this brilliant exhibition Presently reaching the end of his
page he looked up carelessly incidentally It seemed to be borne to
him that Emmy Lou was there whereupon he nodded Then as if moved by
sudden impulse he dived into his desk and after ostentatious search
in on under it brought forth a pencil and held it up for Emmy Lou to
see Nor did she dream that it was for this the little boy had been
there since before Uncle Michael had unlocked the Primer door
Emmy Lou looked across at the pencil It was a slatepencil A fine
long new slatepencil grandly encased for half its length in gold
paper One bought them at the drugstore across from the school and one
paid for them the whole of five cents
Just then a bell rang Emmy Lou got up suddenly But it was the bell for
school to take up So she sat down She was glad Miss Clara was not yet
in her place
After the Primer Class had filed in with panting and frosty entrance
the bell rang again This time it was the right bell tapped by Miss
Clara now in her place So again Emmy Lou got up suddenly and by
following the little girl ahead learned that the bell meant go out to
the bench
The Primer Class according to the degree of its infant precocity was
divided in three sections Emmy Lou belonged to the third section It
was the last section and she was the last one in it though she had no
idea what a section meant nor why she was in it
Yesterday the third section had said over and over in chorus One and
one are two two and two are four etcbut today they said Two and
one are three two and two are four
Emmy Lou wondered four what Which put her behind so that when she
began again they were saying two and four are six So now she knew
Four is six But what is six Emmy Lou did not know
When she came back to her desk the pencil was there The fine new long
slatepencil encased in gold paper And the little boy was gone He
belonged to the first section and the first section was now on the
bench Emmy Lou leaned across and put the pencil back on the little
boys desk
Then she prepared herself to copy digits with her stump of a pencil
Emmy Lous were always stumps Her pencil had a way of rolling off her
desk while she was gone and one pencil makes many stumps The little
boy had generally helped her pick them up on her return But strangely
from this time her pencils rolled off no more
But when Emmy Lou took up her slate there was a whole side filled with
digits in soldierly rows across so her heart grew light and free from
the weight of digits and she gave her time to the washing of her desk
a thing in which her soul revelled and for which patterning after her
little girl neighbors she kept within that desk a bottle of soapy water
and rags of a gray and unpleasant nature that never dried because of
their frequent using When Emmy Lou first came to school her cleaning
paraphernalia consisted of a sponge secured by a string to her slate
which was the badge of the new and the unsophisticated comer Emmy Lou
had quickly learned that and no one now rejoiced in a fuller assortment
of soap bottle and rags than she nor did a sponge longer dangle from
the frame of her slate
On coming in from recess this same day Emmy Lou found the pencil on her
desk again the beautiful new pencil in the gilded paper She put it
back
But when she reached home the pencil the beautiful pencil that cost
all of five cents was in her companion box along with her stumps and
her sponge and her grimy little slate rags And about the pencil was
wrapped a piece of paper It had the look of the margin of a Primer
page The paper bore marks They were not digits
Emmy Lou took the paper to Aunt Cordelia They were at dinner
Cant you read it Emmy Lou asked Aunt Katie the prettiest aunty
Emmy Lou shook her head
Ill spell the letters said Aunt Louise the youngest aunty
But that did not help Emmy Lou one bit
Aunt Cordelia looked troubled She doesnt seem to be catching up she
said
No said Aunt Katie
No agreed Aunt Louise
Noron said Uncle Charlie the brother of the aunties lighting his
cigar to go downtown
Aunt Cordelia spread the paper out It bore the words
It is for you
Illustration Emmy Lou shook her head
So Emmy Lou put the pencil away in the companion and tucked it about
with the grimy slate rags that no harm might befall it And the next day
she took it out and used it But first she looked over at the little
boy The little boy was busy But when she looked up again he was
looking
The little boy grew red and wheeling suddenly fell to copying digits
furiously And from that moment on the little boy was moved to strange
behavior
Three times before recess did he boldly ignoring the preface of
upraised hand swagger up to Miss Claras desk And going and coming
the little boys boots with copper toes and rundown heels marked with
thumping emphasis upon the echoing boards his processional and
recessional And reaching his desk the little boy slammed down his
slate with clattering reverberations
Emmy Lou watched him uneasily She was miserable for him She did not
know that there are times when the emotions are more potent than the
subtlest wines Nor did she know that the male of some species is moved
thus to exhibition of prowess courage defiance for the impressing of
the chosen female of the species
Emmy Lou merely knew that she was miserable and that she trembled for
the little boy
Having clattered his slate until Miss Clara rapped sharply the little
boy arose and went swaggering on an excursion around the room to where
sat the bucket and dipper And on his return he came up the centre aisle
between the sheep and the goats
Emmy Lou had no idea what happened It took place behind her But there
was another little girl who did A little girl who boasted curls yellow
curls in tiered rows about her head A lachrymosal little girl who
affected great horror of the little boys
And what Emmy Lou failed to see was this the little boy in passing
deftly lift a cherished curl between finger and thumb and proceed on his
way
The little girl did not fail the little boy In the suddenness of the
surprise she surprised even him by her outcry Miss Clara jumped Emmy
Lou jumped And the sixtynine jumped And following this the little
girl lifted her voice in lachrymal lament
Miss Clara sat erect The Primer Class held its breath It always held
its breath when Miss Clara sat erect Emmy Lou held tightly to her desk
besides She wondered what it was all about
Then Miss Clara spoke Her accents cut the silence
Billy Traver
Billy Traver stood forth It was the little boy
Since you seem pleased to occupy yourself with the little girls Billy
go to the pegs
Emmy Lou trembled Go to the pegs What unknown inquisitorial terrors
lay behind those dread laconic words Emmy Lou knew not
She could only sit and watch the little boy turn and stump back down the
aisle and around the room to where along the wall hung rows of feminine
apparel
Here he stopped and scanned the line Then he paused before a hat It
was a round little hat with silky nap and a curling brim It had
rosettes to keep the ears warm and ribbon that tied beneath the chin It
was Emmy Lous hat Aunt Cordelia had cautioned her to care concerning
it
The little boy took it down There seemed to be no doubt in his mind as
to what Miss Clara meant But then he had been in the Primer Class from
the beginning
Illustration Emmy Lou did not laugh She made room for Billy
Having taken the hat down he proceeded to put it upon his own shock
head His face wore its broad and constant smile One would have said
the little boy was enjoying the affair As he put the hat on the
sixtynine laughed The seventieth did not It was her hat and besides
she did not understand
Miss Clara still erect spoke again And now since you are a little
girl get your book Billy and move over with the girls
Nor did Emmy Lou understand why when Billy having gathered his
belongings together moved across the aisle and sat down with her the
sixtynine laughed again Emmy Lou did not laugh She made room for
Billy
Nor did she understand when Billy treated her to a slow and
surreptitious wink his freckled countenance grinning beneath the
rosetted hat It never could have occurred to Emmy Lou that Billy had
laid his cunning plans to this very end Emmy Lou understood nothing of
all this She only pitied Billy And presently when public attention
had become diverted she proffered him the hospitality of a grimy little
slate rag When Billy returned the rag there was something in
itsomething wrapped in a beautiful glazed shining bronze paper It
was a candy kiss One paid five cents for six of them at the drugstore
On the road home Emmy Lou ate the candy The beautiful shiny paper she
put in her Primer The slip of paper that she found within she carried
to Aunt Cordelia It was sticky and it was smeared But it had reading
on it
But this is printing said Aunt Cordelia cant you read it
Emmy Lou shook her head
Try said Aunt Katie
The easy words said Aunt Louise
But Emmy Lou remembering cat Pussy shook her head
Aunt Cordelia looked troubled She certainly isnt catching up said
Aunt Cordelia Then she read from the slip of paper
Oh woman woman thou wert made
The peace of Adam to invade
The aunties laughed but Emmy Lou put it away with the glazed paper in
her Primer It meant quite as much to her as did the reading in that
Primer Cat a cat the cat The bat the mat a rat It was the jingle
to both that appealed to Emmy Lou
About this time rumors began to reach Emmy Lou She heard that it was
February and that wonderful things were peculiar to the Fourteenth At
recess the little girls locked arms and talked Valentines The echoes
reached Emmy Lou
The valentines must come from a little boy or it wasnt the real thing
And to get no valentine was a dreadfuldreadful thing And even the
timidest of the sheep began to cast eyes across at the goats
Emmy Lou wondered if she would get a valentine And if not how was she
to survive the contumely and shame
You must never never breathe to a living soul what was on your
valentine To tell even your best and truest little girl friend was to
prove faithless to the little boy sending the valentine These things
reached Emmy Lou
Not for the world would she tell Emmy Lou was sure of that so grateful
did she feel she would be to anyone sending her a valentine
And in doubt and wretchedness did she wend her way to school on the
Fourteenth Day of February The drugstore window was full of
valentines But Emmy Lou crossed the street She did not want to see
them She knew the little girls would ask her if she had gotten a
valentine And she would have to say No
She was early The big empty room echoed back her footsteps as she went
to her desk to lay down book and slate before taking off her wraps Nor
did Emmy Lou dream the eye of the little boy peeped through the crack of
the door from Miss Claras dressingroom
Emmy Lous hat and jacket were forgotten On her desk lay something
square and white It was an envelope It was a beautiful envelope all
over flowers and scrolls
Emmy Lou knew it It was a valentine Her cheeks grew pink
She took it out It was blue And it was gold And it had reading on it
Emmy Lous heart sank She could not read the reading The door opened
Some little girls came in Emmy Lou hid her valentine in her book for
since you must notshe would never show her valentinenever
The little girls wanted to know if she had gotten a valentine and Emmy
Lou said Yes and her cheeks were pink with the joy of being able to
say it
Through the day she took peeps between the covers of her Primer but no
one else might see it
It rested heavy on Emmy Lous heart however that there was reading on
it She studied it surreptitiously The reading was made up of letters
It was the first time Emmy Lou had thought about that She knew some of
the letters She would ask someone the letters she did not know by
pointing them out on the chart at recess Emmy Lou was learning It was
the first time since she came to school
But what did the letters make She wondered after recess studying the
valentine again
Then she went home She followed Aunt Cordelia about Aunt Cordelia was
busy
Illustration She sought the houseboy
What does it read asked Emmy Lou
Aunt Cordelia listened
B said Emmy Lou and e
Be said Aunt Cordelia
If B was Be it was strange that B and e were Be But many things were
strange
Emmy Lou accepted them all on faith
After dinner she approached Aunt Katie
What does it read asked Emmy Lou m and y
My said Aunt Katie
The rest was harder She could not remember the letters and had to copy
them off on her slate Then she sought Tom the houseboy Tom was out
at the gate talking to another houseboy She waited until the other boy
was gone
What does it read asked Emmy Lou and she told the letters off the
slate It took Tom some time but finally he told her
Just then a little girl came along She was a firstsection little girl
and at school she never noticed Emmy Lou
Now she was alone so she stopped
Get any valentines
Yes said Emmy Lou Then moved to confidence by the little girls
friendliness she added It has reading on it
Pooh said the little girl they all have that My mammas been
reading the long verses inside to me
Can you show themvalentines asked Emmy Lou
Of course to grownup people said the little girl
The gas was lit when Emmy Lou came in Uncle Charlie was there and the
aunties sitting around reading
I got a valentine said Emmy Lou
They all looked up They had forgotten it was Valentines Day and it
came to them that if Emmy Lous mother had not gone away never to come
back the year before Valentines Day would not have been forgotten
Aunt Cordelia smoothed the black dress she was wearing because of the
mother who would never come back and looked troubled
But Emmy Lou laid the blue and gold valentine on Aunt Cordelias knee
In the valentines centre were two hands clasping Emmy Lous
forefinger pointed to the words beneath the clasped hands
I can read it said Emmy Lou
They listened Uncle Charlie put down his paper Aunt Louise looked over
Aunt Cordelias shoulder
B said Emmy Lou eBe
The aunties nodded
M said Emmy Lou ymy
Emmy Lou did not hesitate V said Emmy Lou a l e n t i n
eValentine Be my Valentine
There said Aunt Cordelia
Well said Aunt Katie
At last said Aunt Louise
Hm said Uncle Charlie
A LITTLE FEMININE CASABIANCA
The close of the first week of Emmy Lous second year at a certain large
public school found her round chubby self like a pinkcheeked period
ending the long line of intermingled little boys and girls making what
was known twentyfive years ago as the FirstReader Class Emmy Lou
had spent her first year in the Primer Class where the teacher Miss
Clara by name had concealed the kindliest of hearts behind a brusque
and energetic manner and had possessed along with her red hair and a
temper tinged with that color also a sharp voice that by its
unexpected snap in attacking some small sinner had caused Emmy Lous
little heart to jump many times a day Here Emmy Lou had spent the year
in strenuously guiding a squeaking pencil across a protesting slate or
singing in chorus as Miss Claras long wooden pointer went up and down
the rows of words on the spellingchart At at bat bat cat
cat or an an ban ban can can Emmy Lou herself had so
little idea of what it was all about that she was dependent on her
neighbor to give her the key to the proper startingpoint heading the
various columnsat at or an an or et et or on on
after that it was easy sailing But one awful day while the class
stopped suddenly at Miss Claras warning finger as visitors opened the
door Emmy Lou her eyes squeezed tight shut her little body rocking to
and fro to the rhythm went right on man man pan panuntil
at the sound of her own singsong little voice rising with appalling
fervor upon the silence she stopped to find that the page in the
meantime had been turned and that the pointer was directed to a column
beginning oy oy
Illustration Guiding a squeaking pencil across a protesting slate
Among other things incident to that first year too had been Recess
At that time everybody was turned out into a brickpaved yard the boys
on one side of a high fence the girls on the other And here waiting
without the wooden shed where stood a row of buckets each holding a
shiny tin dipper Emmy Lou would stop on the sloppy outskirts for the
thirst of the larger girls to be assuaged that the little girls
opportunity might cometogether with the dregs in the buckets And at
Recess too along with the danger of being run into by the larger girls
at play and having the breath knocked out of ones little body which
made it necessary to seek sequestered corners and peep out thence there
was The Man to be watched for and avoidedthe low square
blackbrowed blackbearded Man who brandished a broom at the little
girls who dropped their applecores and crusts on the pavements and who
shook his fist at the jeering little boys who dared to swarm to the
forbidden top and sit straddling the dividing fence That Uncle Michael
the janitor was getting old and had rheumatic twinges was indeed Uncle
Michaels excuse but Emmy Lou did not know this and her fear of Uncle
Michael was great accordingly
But somehow the Primer year wore away and one day toward its close in
the presence of Miss Clara two solemnlooking gentlemen requested
certain little boys to cipher and several little girls to spell and
sent others to the blackboard or the chart while to Emmy Lou was handed
a Primer open at Page 17 which she was told to read Knowing Page 17
by heart and identifying it by its picture Emmy Lou arose and her
small voice droned forth in singsong fashion
How old are you Sue
I am as old as my cat
And how old is your cat
My cat is as old as my dog
And how old is your dog
My dog is as old as I am
Having so delivered herself Emmy Lou sat down not at all disconcerted
to find that she had been holding her Primer upside down
Following this Emmy Lou was told that she had passed and seeing from
the jubilance of the other children that it was a matter to be joyful
over Emmy Lou went home and told the elders of her family that she had
passed And these elders three aunties and an uncle an uncle who was
disposed to look at Emmy Lous chubby self and her concerns in jocular
fashion laughed and Emmy Lou went on wondering what it was all about
which never would have been the case had there been a mother among the
elders for mothers have a way of understanding these things But to
Emmy Lou mother had come to mean but a memory which faded as it came
a vague consciousness of encircling arms of a brooding tender face of
yearning eyes and it was only because they told her that Emmy Lou
remembered how mother had gone away South one winter to get well That
they afterward told her it was Heaven in no wise confused Emmy Lou
because for aught she knew South and Heaven and much else might be
included in these points of the compass Ever since then Emmy Lou had
lived with the three aunties and the uncle and papa had been coming a
hundred miles once a month to see her
When Emmy Lou went back to school for the second year she was told that
she was now in the First Reader If her heart had jumped at the sharp
accents of Miss Clara it now grew still within her at the slow awful
enunciation of the Large Lady in black bombazine who reigned over the
department of the First Reader pointing her morals with a heavy
forefinger before which Emmy Lous eyes lowered with every aspect of
conscious guilt Nor did Emmy Lou dream that the Large Lady whose black
bombazine was the visible sign of a loss by death that had made it
necessary for her to enter the schoolroom to earn a living was finding
the duties incident to the First Reader almost as strange and perplexing
as Emmy Lou herself
Emmy Lou from the first day found herself descending steadily to the
foot of the class and there she remained until the awful day at the
close of the first week when the Large Lady realizing perhaps that she
could no longer ignore such adherence to that lowly position made
discovery that while to Emmy Lou dog might spell dog and
frog might spell frog Emmy Lou could not find either on a
printed page and further could not tell wherein they differed when
found for her that also Emmy Lou made her figure 8s by adding one
uncertain little o to the top of another uncertain little o and that
while Emmy Lou might copy in smeary columns certain cabalistic signs
off the blackboard she could not point them off in tens hundreds
thousands or read their numerical values to save her little life The
Large Lady sorely perplexed within herself as to the proper course to
be pursued in the sight of the fiftynine other FirstReaders pointed a
condemning forefinger at the miserable little object standing in front
of her platform and said You will stay after school Emma Louise
that I may examine further into your qualifications for this grade
Illustration Sounds grew fewer fainter farther away  a door
slammed somewherethensilence
Now Emmy Lou had no idea what it meantexamine further into your
qualifications for this grade It might be the form of punishment in
vogue for the chastisement of the members of the First Reader But
stay after school she did understand and her heart sank and her
little breast heaved
It was then past the noon recess In those days in this particular
city school closed at halfpast one At last the bell for dismissal had
rung The Large Lady arms folded across her bombazine bosom had faced
the class and with awesome solemnity had already enunciated
Attention and sixty little people had sat up straight when the door
opened and a teacher from the floor above came in
At her whispered confidence the Large Lady left the room hastily while
the strange teacher with a hurried onetwothree march out quietly
children turned and followed her And Emmy Lou left sitting at her
desk saw through gathering tears the line of FirstReaders wind around
the room and file out the door the sound of their departing footsteps
along the bare corridors and down the echoing stairway coming back like
a knell to her sinking heart Then class after class from above marched
past the door and on its clattering way while voices from outside
shrill with the joy of the release came up through the open windows in
talk in laughter together with the patter of feet on the bricks Then
as these familiar sounds grew fewer fainter farther away some belated
footsteps went echoing through the building a door slammed
