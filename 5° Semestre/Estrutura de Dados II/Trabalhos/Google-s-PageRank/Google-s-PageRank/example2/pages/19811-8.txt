SIR THOMAS MALORY  15th century
DEATH OF SIR GAWAINE
And so as Sir Mordred was at Dover with his host there came King
Arthur with a great navy of ships galleys and carracks  And there
was Sir Mordred ready waiting upon his landing to let his own father
to land upon the land that he was king of  Then was there launching of
great boats and small and all were full of noble men of arms and
there was much slaughter of gentle knights and many a full bold baron
was laid full low on both parties  But King Arthur was so courageous
that there might no manner of knight let him to land and his knights
fiercely followed him and so they landed maugre Sir Mordred and all
his power and put Sir Mordred back that he fled and all his people
So when this battle was done King Arthur let bury his people that were
dead  And then was the noble knight Sir Gawaine found in a great boat
lying more than half dead  When King Arthur wist that Sir Gawaine was
laid so low he went unto him and there the king made sorrow out of
measure and took Sir Gawaine in his arms and thrice he swooned  And
when he came to himself again he said Alas my sisters son here
now thou liest the man in the world 2 that I loved most and now is
my joy gone  For now my nephew Sir Gawaine I will discover me unto
your person  In Sir Launcelot and you I most had my joy and mine
affiance and now have I lost my joy of you both wherefore all mine
earthly joy is gone from me  My uncle King Arthur said Sir
Gawaine wit you well that my deaths day is come and all is through
mine own hastiness and wilfulness for I am smitten upon the old wound
that Sir Launcelot du Lake gave me of the which I feel that I must
die and if Sir Launcelot had been with you as he was this unhappy war
had never begun and of all this I myself am causer for Sir Launcelot
and his blood through their prowess held all your cankered enemies in
subjection and danger  And now said Sir Gawaine ye shall miss Sir
Launcelot  But alas  I would not accord with him and therefore
said Sir Gawaine I pray you fair uncle that I may have paper pen
and ink that I may write unto Sir Launcelot a letter with mine own
hands  And when paper and ink was brought Sir Gawaine was set up
weakly by King Arthur for he had been shriven a little before and he
wrote thus unto Sir Launcelot Flower of all noble knights that ever I
heard of or saw in my days I Sir Gawaine King Lots son of Orkney
sisters son unto the noble King Arthur send unto thee greeting and
let thee have knowledge that the tenth day of May I was smitten upon
the old wound which thou gavest me before the city of Benwick and
through the same wound that thou gavest me I am come unto my death day
and I will that all the world wit that I Sir Gawaine Knight of the
Round Table sought my death and not through thy deserving 3 but it
was mine own seeking wherefore I beseech thee Sir Launcelot for to
return again unto this realm and see my tomb or pray some prayer more
or less for my soul  And that same day that I wrote this letter I was
hurt to the death in the same wound the which I had of thy hands Sir
Launcelot for of a more nobler man might I not be slain  Also Sir
Launcelot for all the love that ever was between us make no tarrying
but come over the sea in all the haste that thou mayst with thy noble
knights and rescue that noble king that made thee knight that is my
lord and uncle King Arthur for he is full straitly bestood with a
false traitor which is my halfbrother Sir Mordred and he hath let
crown himself king and he would have wedded my lady Queen Guenevere
and so had he done if she had not put herself in the Tower of London
And so the tenth day of May last past my lord and uncle King Arthur
and we all landed upon them at Dover and there we put that false
traitor Sir Mordred to flight  And there it misfortuned me for to be
stricken upon thy stroke  And the date of this letter was written but
two hours and a half before my death written with mine own hand and
so subscribed with part of my heartblood  And I require thee as thou
art the most famost knight of the world that thou wilt see my tomb
And then Sir Gawaine wept and also King Arthur wept and then they
swooned both  And when they awaked both the king made Sir Gawaine to
receive his Saviour  And then Sir Gawaine prayed the king to send for
Sir Launcelot and to cherish him above all other knights  And so at
the hour of noon Sir Gawaine betook his soul into the 4 hands of our
Lord God  And then the king let bury him in a chapel within the castle
of Dover and there yet unto this day all men may see the skull of Sir
Gawaine and the same wound is seen that Sir Launcelot gave him in
battle  Then it was told to King Arthur that Sir Mordred had pight a
new field upon Barendown  And on the morrow the king rode thither to
him and there was a great battle between them and much people were
slain on both parts  But at the last King Arthurs party stood best
and Sir Mordred and his party fled into Canterbury

THE QUEENS SPEECH TO HER LAST PARLIAMENT NOVEMBER 30 1601
Mr SpeakerWe perceive your coming is to present thanks unto us
Know I accept them with no less joy than your loves can desire to offer
such a present and do more esteem it than any treasure or riches for
those we know how to prize but loyalty love and thanks I account
them invaluable and though God hath raised me high yet this I account
the glory of my crown that I have reigned with your loves  This makes
that I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a queen as
to be a queen over so thankful a people and to be the means under God
to conserve you in safety and 5 preserve you from danger yea to be
the instrument to deliver you from dishonour from shame and from
infamy to keep you from out of servitude and from slavery under our
enemies and cruel tyranny and vile oppression intended against us
for the better withstanding whereof we take very acceptable your
intended helps and chiefly in that it manifesteth your loves and
largeness of hearts to your sovereign  Of myself I must say this I
never was any greedy scraping grasper nor a strict fastingholding
prince nor yet a waster my heart was never set upon any worldly
goods but only for my subjects good  What you do bestow on me I will
not hoard up but receive it to bestow on you again yea mine own
properties I account yours to be expended for your good and your eyes
shall see the bestowing of it for your welfare
Mr Speaker I would wish you and the rest to stand up for I fear I
shall yet trouble you with longer speech
Mr Speaker you give me thanks but I am more to thank you and I
charge you thank them of the Lower House from me for had I not
received knowledge from you I might a fallen into the lapse of an
error only for want of true information  Since I was queen yet did I
never put my pen to any grant but upon pretext and semblance made me
that it was for the good and avail of my subjects generally though a
private profit to some of my ancient servants who have deserved well
but that my grants shall be made grievances to my people and
oppressions to be privileged under colour of our patents our princely
dignity shall not suffer it
When I heard it I could give no rest unto my 6 thoughts until I had
reformed it and those varlets lewd persons abusers of my bounty
shall know I will not suffer it  And Mr Speaker tell the House from
me I take it exceeding grateful that the knowledge of these things is
come unto me from them  And though amongst them the principal members
are such as are not touched in private and therefore need not speak
from any feeling of the grief yet we have heard that other gentlemen
also of the House who stand as free have spoken freely in it which
gives us to know that no respects or interests have moved them other
than the minds they bear to suffer no diminution of our honour and our
subjects love unto us  The zeal of which affection tending to ease my
people and knit their hearts unto us I embrace with a princely care
far above all earthly treasures  I esteem my peoples love more than
which I desire not to merit and God that gave me here to sit and
placed me over you knows that I never respected myself but as your
good was conserved in me yet what dangers what practices what perils
I have passed some if not all of you know but none of these things
do move me or ever made me fear but its God that hath delivered me
And in my governing this land I have ever set the last judgment day
before mine eyes and so to rule as I shall be judged and answer before
a higher Judge to whose judgment seat I do appeal in that thought was
never cherished in my heart that tended not to my peoples good
And if my princely bounty have been abused and my grants turned to the
hurt of my people contrary to 7 my will and meaning or if any in
authority under me have neglected or have converted what I have
committed unto them I hope God will not lay their culps to my charge
To be a king and wear a crown is a thing more glorious to them that
see it than its pleasant to them that bear it for myself I never was
so much enticed with the glorious name of a king or the royal
authority of a queen as delighted that God hath made me his instrument
to maintain his truth and glory and to defend this kingdom from
dishonour damage tyranny and oppression  But should I ascribe any
of these things to myself or my sexly weakness I were not worthy to
live and of all most unworthy of the mercies I have received at Gods
hands but to God only and wholly all is given and ascribed
The cares and troubles of a crown I cannot more fitly resemble than to
the drugs of a learned physician perfumed with some aromatical savour
or to bitter pills gilded over by which they are made more acceptable
or less offensive which indeed are bitter and unpleasant to take and
for my own part were it not for conscience sake to discharge the duty
that God hath laid upon me and to maintain his glory and keep you in
safety in mine own disposition I should be willing to resign the place
I hold to any other and glad to be freed of the glory with the
labours for it is not my desire to live nor to reign longer than my
life and reign shall be for your good  And though you have had and may
have many mightier and wiser princes sitting in this seat yet you
never had or shall have any that will love you better

SIR THOMAS NORTH 15351601
DEATH OF CLEOPATRA
Shortly after Caesar came himself in person to see her and to comfort
her  Cleopatra being laid upon a little low bed in poor estate when
she saw Caesar come in to her chamber she suddenly rose up naked in
her smock and fell down at his feet marvellously disfigured both for
that she had plucked her hair from her head as also for that she had
martyred all her face with her nails and besides her voice was small
and trembling her eyes sunk into her head with continual blubbering
and moreover they might see the most part of her stomach torn in
sunder  To be short her body was not much better than her mind yet
her good grace and comeliness and the force of her beauty was not
altogether defaced  But notwithstanding this ugly and pitiful state of
hers yet she shewed herself within by her outward looks and
countenance  When Caesar had made her lie down again and sat by her
bedside Cleopatra began to clear and excuse herself for that she had
done laying all to the fear she had of Antonius  Caesar in contrary
manner reproved her in every point  Then she suddenly altered her
speech and prayed him to pardon her as though she were afraid to die
and desirous to live  At length she gave him a brief and memorial of
all the ready money and treasure she had  But by chance there stood
Seleucus by one of her treasurers who to seem a good servant came
straight to Caesar to disprove 9 Cleopatra that she had not set in
all but kept many things back of purpose  Cleopatra was in such a
rage with him that she flew upon him and took him by the hair of the
head and boxed him wellfavouredly  Caesar fell alaughing and
parted the fray  Alas said she O Caesar is not this a great
shame and reproach that thou having vouchsafed to take the pains to
come unto me and hast done me this honour poor wretch and caitiff
creature brought into this pitiful and miserable estate and that mine
own servants should come now to accuse me though it may be I have
reserved some jewels and trifles meet for women but not for me poor
soul to set out myself withal but meaning to give some pretty
presents and gifts unto Octavia and Livia that they making means and
intercession for me to thee thou mightest yet extend thy favour and
mercy upon me  Caesar was glad to hear her say so persuading himself
thereby that she had yet a desire to save her life  So he made her
answer that he did not only give her that to dispose of at her
pleasure which she had kept back but further promised to use her more
honourably and bountifully than she would think for and so he took his
leave of her supposing he had deceived her but indeed he was deceived
himself
There was a young gentleman Cornelius Dolabella that was one of
Caesars very great familiars and besides did bear no evil will unto
Cleopatra  He sent her word secretly as she had requested him that
Caesar determined to take his journey through Syria and that within
three days he would send her away before with her children  When this
was told Cleopatra she requested Caesar that 10 it would please him
to suffer her to offer the last oblations of the dead unto the soul of
Antonius  This being granted her she was carried to the place where
his tomb was and there falling down on her knees embracing the tomb
with her women the tears running down her cheeks she began to speak
in this sort O my dear Lord Antonius not long sithence I buried thee
here being a free woman and now I offer unto thee the funeral
sprinklings and oblations being a captive and prisoner and yet I am
forbidden and kept from tearing and murdering this captive body of mine
with blows which they carefully guard and keep only to triumph of
thee look therefore henceforth for no other honours offerings nor
sacrifices from me for these are the last which Cleopatra can give
thee sith now they carry her away  Whilst we lived together nothing
could sever our companies but now at our death I fear me they will
make us change our countries  For as thou being a Roman hast been
buried in Egypt even so wretched creature I an Egyptian shall be
buried in Italy which shall be all the good that I have received by
thy country  If therefore the gods where thou art now have any power
and authority sith our gods here have forsaken us suffer not thy true
friend and lover to be carried away alive that in me they triumph of
thee but receive me with thee and let me be buried in one self tomb
with thee  For though my griefs and miseries be infinite yet none
hath grieved me more nor that I could less bear withal than this
small time which I have been driven to live without thee  Then
having ended these doleful plaints and crowned the tomb with garlands
and sundry 11 nosegays and marvellous lovingly embraced the same
she commanded they should prepare her bath and when she had bathed and
washed herself she fell to her meat and was sumptuously served
Now whilst she was at dinner there came a countryman and brought her a
basket  The soldiers that warded at the gates asked him straight what
he had in his basket  He opened the basket and took out the leaves
that covered the figs and shewed them that they were figs he brought
They all of them marvelled to see so goodly figs  The countryman
laughed to hear them and bade them take some if they would  They
believed he told them truly and so bade him carry them in
After Cleopatra had dined she sent a certain table written and sealed
unto Caesar and commanded them all to go out of the tombs where she
was but the two women then she shut the doors to her  Caesar when
he received this table and began to read her lamentation and petition
requesting him that he would let her be buried with Antonius found
straight what she meant and thought to have gone thither himself
howbeit he sent one before in all haste that might be to see what it
was  Her death was very sudden  For those whom Caesar sent unto her
ran thither in all haste possible and found the soldiers standing at
the gate mistrusting nothing nor understanding of her death  But
when they had opened the doors they found Cleopatra stark dead laid
upon a bed of gold attired and arrayed in her royal robes and one of
her two women which was called Iras dead at her feet and her other
woman called Charmion half dead and trembling trimming the diadem
which 12 Cleopatra ware upon her head  One of the soldiers seeing
her angrily said unto her Is that well done Charmion  Very
well said she again and meet for a princess descended from the race
of so many noble kings  She said no more but fell down dead hard by
the bed
Plutarchs Lives
SIR WALTER RALEGH 15521618
THE VANITY OF GREATNESS
By this which we have already set down is seen the beginning and end of
the three first monarchies of the world whereof the founders and
erecters thought that they could never have ended  That of Rome
which made the fourth was also at this time almost at the highest  We
have left it flourishing in the middle of the field having rooted up
or cut down all that kept it from the eyes and admiration of the world
But after some continuance it shall begin to lose the beauty it had
the storms of ambition shall beat her great boughs and branches one
against another her leaves shall fall off her limbs wither and a
rabble of barbarous nations enter the field and cut her down
Now these great kings and conquering nations have been the subject of
those ancient histories which have been preserved and yet remain among
us and withal of so many tragical poets as in the persons of powerful
princes and other mighty men have complained against 13 infidelity
time destiny and most of all against the variable success of worldly
things and instability of fortune  To these undertakings these great
lords of the world have been stirred up rather by the desire of fame
which plougheth up the air and soweth in the wind than by the
affection of bearing rule which draweth after it so much vexation and
so many cares  And that this is true the good advice of Cineas to
Pyrrhus proves  And certainly as fame hath often been dangerous to
the living so it is to the dead of no use at all because separate
from knowledge  Which were it otherwise and the extreme ill bargain
of buying this lasting discourse understood by them which are
dissolved they themselves would then rather have wished to have stolen
out of the world without noise than to be put in mind that they have
purchased the report of their actions in the world by rapine
oppression and cruelty by giving in spoil the innocent and labouring
soul to the idle and insolent and by having emptied the cities of the
world of their ancient inhabitants and fitted them again with so many
and so variable sorts of sorrows
Since the fall of the Roman Empire omitting that of the Germans which
had neither greatness nor continuance there hath been no state fearful
in the east but that of the Turk nor in the west any prince that hath
spread his wings far over his nest but the Spaniard who since the
time that Ferdinand expelled the Moors out of Grenado have made many
attempts to make themselves masters of all Europe  And it is true that
by the treasures of both Indies and by the many kingdoms which they
possess in Europe they are at this day the most 14 powerful  But as
the Turk is now counterpoised by the Persian so instead of so many
millions as have been spent by the English French and Netherlands in
a defensive war and in diversions against them it is easy to
demonstrate that with the charge of two hundred thousand pound
continued but for two years or three at the most they may not only be
persuaded to live in peace but all their swelling and overflowing
streams may be brought back into their natural channels and old banks
These two nations I say are at this day the most eminent and to be
regarded the one seeking to root out the Christian religion
altogether the other the truth and sincere profession thereof the one
to join all Europe to Asia the other the rest of all Europe to Spain
For the rest if we seek a reason of the succession and continuance of
this boundless ambition in mortal men we may add to that which hath
been already said that the kings and princes of the world have always
laid before them the actions but not the ends of those great ones
which preceded them  They are always transported with the glory of the
one but they never mind the misery of the other till they find the
experience in themselves  They neglect the advice of God while they
enjoy life or hope it but they follow the counsel of Death upon his
first approach  It is he that puts into man all wisdom of the world
without speaking a word which God with all the words of His law
promises or threats doth not infuse  Death which hateth and
destroyeth man is believed God which hath him and loves him is
always deferred  I have considered saith Solomon all the works
that are wider the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of 15
spirit but who believes it till Death tells it us  It was Death
which opening the conscience of Charles the fifth made him enjoin his
son Philip to restore Navarre and King Francis the first of France to
command that justice should be done upon the murderers of the
Protestants in Merindol and Cabrieres which till then he neglected
It is therefore Death alone that can suddenly make man to know himself
He tells the proud and insolent that they are but abjects and humbles
them at the instant makes them cry complain and repent yea even to
hate their forepassed happiness  He takes the account of the rich and
proves him a beggar a naked beggar which hath interest in nothing but
in the gravel that fills his mouth  He holds a glass before the eyes
of the most beautiful and makes them see therein their deformity and
rottenness and they acknowledge it
O eloquent just and mighty Death whom none could advise thou hast
persuaded what none hath dared thou hast done and whom all the world
hath flattered thou only hast cast out of the world and despised
Thou hast drawn together all the farstretched greatness all the
pride cruelty and ambition of man and covered it all over with these
two narrow words Hic jacet

RICHARD HOOKER 15541600
THE LAW OF NATIONS
Now besides that law which simply concerneth men as men and that which
belongeth unto them as they are men linked with others in some form of
politic society there is a third kind of law which toucheth all such
several bodies politic so far forth as one of them hath public
commerce with another  And this third is the Law of Nations  Between
men and beasts there is no possibility of social communion because the
wellspring of that communion is a natural delight which man hath to
transfuse from himself into others and to receive from others into
himself especially those things wherein the excellency of his kind doth
most consist  The chiefest instrument of human communion therefore is
speech because thereby we impart mutually one to another the conceits
of our reasonable understanding  And for that cause seeing beasts are
not hereof capable forasmuch as with them we can use no such
conference they being in degree although above other creatures on
earth to whom nature hath denied sense yet lower than to be sociable
companions of man to whom nature hath given reason it is of Adam said
that amongst the beasts he found not for himself any meet companion
Civil society doth more content the nature of man than any private kind
of solitary living because in society this good of mutual
participation is so much larger than otherwise  Herewith
notwithstanding we are not satisfied but we covet 17 if it might
be to have a kind of society and fellowship even with all mankind
Which thing Socrates intending to signify professed himself a citizen
not of this or that commonwealth but of the world  And an effect of
that very natural desire in us a manifest token that we wish after a
sort an universal fellowship with all men appeareth by the wonderful
delight men have some to visit foreign countries some to discover
nations not heard of in former ages we all to know the affairs and
dealings of other people yea to be in league of amity with them and
this not only for traffics sake or to the end that when many are
confederated each may make other the more strong but for such cause
also as moved the Queen of Saba to visit Solomon and in a word
because nature doth presume that how many men there are in the world
so many gods as it were there are or at leastwise such they should be
towards men

FRANCIS BACON 15611626
OF STUDIES
Studies serve for delight for ornament and for ability  Their chief
use for delight is in privateness and retiring for ornament is in
discourse and for ability is in the judgment and disposition of
business  For expert men can execute and perhaps judge of
particulars one by one but the general counsels and the plots and
the marshalling of affairs come best from those that are learned  To
spend too much time in 18 studies is sloth to use them too much for
ornament is affectation to make judgment wholly by their rules is the
humour of a scholar  They perfect nature and are perfected by
experience for natural abilities are like natural plants that need
pruning by study and studies themselves do give forth directions too
much at large except they be bounded in by experience  Crafty men
contemn studies simple men admire them and wise men use them for
they teach not their own use but that is a wisdom without them and
above them won by observation  Read not to contradict and confute
nor to believe and take for granted nor to find talk and discourse
but to weigh and consider  Some books are to be tasted others to be
swallowed and some few to be chewed and digested that is some books
are to be read only in parts others to be read but not curiously and
some few to be read wholly and with diligence and attention  Some
books also may be read by deputy and extracts made of them by others
but that would be only in the less important arguments and the meaner
sort of books else distilled books are like common distilled waters
flashy things  Reading maketh a full man conference a ready man and
writing an exact man  And therefore if a man write little he had
need have a great memory if he confer little he had need have a
present wit and if he read little he had need have much cunning to
seem to know that he doth not  Histories make men wise poets witty
the mathematics subtle natural philosophy deep moral grave logic and
rhetoric able to contend Abeunt studia in mores  Nay there is no
stond or impediment in the wit but may be wrought 19 out by fit
studies like as diseases of the body may have appropriate exercises
Bowling is good for the stone and reins shooting for the lungs and
breast gentle walking for the stomach riding for the head and the
like  So if a mans wit be wandering let him study the mathematics
for in demonstrations if his wit be called away never so little he
must begin again  If his wit be not apt to distinguish or find
differences let him study the schoolmen for they are Cymini
sectores  If he be not apt to beat over matters and to call up one
thing to prove and illustrate another let him study the lawyers
cases  So every defect of the mind may have a special receipt

WILLIAM DRUMMOND 15851649
MEDITATION ON DEATH
If on the great theatre of this earth among the numberless number of
men to die were only proper to thee and thine then undoubtedly thou
had reason to repine at so severe and partial a law  But since it is a
necessity from which never any age bypast hath been exempted and
unto which they which be and so many as are to come are thralled no
consequent of life being more common and familiar why shouldst thou
with unprofitable and noughtavailing stubbornness oppose so
inevitable and necessary a condition  This is the highway of
morality and our general home Behold what millions have trod it
before thee what multitudes shall after thee with them which at that
same instant 20 run  In so universal a calamity if Death be one
private complaints cannot be heard with so many royal palaces it is
no loss to see thy poor cabin burn  Shall the heavens stay their
everrolling wheels for what is the motion of them but the motion of a
swift and everwhirling wheel which twineth forth and again uprolleth
our life and hold still time to prolong thy miserable days as if the
highest of their working were to do homage unto thee  Thy death is a
pace of the order of this All a part of the life of this world for
