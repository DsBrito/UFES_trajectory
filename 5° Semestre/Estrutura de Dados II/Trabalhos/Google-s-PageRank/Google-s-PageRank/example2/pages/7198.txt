Well hes mended kites for me Huck and knitted hooks on to my
line I wish we could get him out of there
My we couldnt get him out Tom And besides twouldnt do any
good theyd ketch him again
Yesso they would But I hate to hear em abuse him so like the
dickens when he never donethat
I do too Tom Lord I hear em say hes the bloodiest looking
villain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before
Yes they talk like that all the time Ive heard em say that if he
was to get free theyd lynch him
And theyd do it too
The boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort As the
twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood
of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that
something would happen that might clear away their difficulties But
nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in
this luckless captive
The boys did as they had often done beforewent to the cell grating
and gave Potter some tobacco and matches He was on the ground floor
and there were no guards
His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences
beforeit cut deeper than ever this time They felt cowardly and
treacherous to the last degree when Potter said
Youve been mighty good to me boysbettern anybody else in this
town And I dont forget it I dont Often I says to myself says I
I used to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where the
good fishin places was and befriend em what I could and now theyve
all forgot old Muff when hes in trouble but Tom dont and Huck
dontTHEY dont forget him says I and I dont forget them Well
boys I done an awful thingdrunk and crazy at the timethats the
only way I account for itand now I got to swing for it and its
right Right and BEST too I reckonhope so anyway Well we wont
talk about that I dont want to make YOU feel bad youve befriended
me But what I want to say is dont YOU ever get drunkthen you wont
ever get here Stand a litter furder westsothats it its a prime
comfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck of
trouble and there dont none come here but yourn Good friendly
facesgood friendly faces Git up on one anothers backs and let me
touch em Thats it Shake handsyournll come through the bars but
mines too big Little hands and weakbut theyve helped Muff Potter
a power and theyd help him more if they could
Tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of
horrors The next day and the day after he hung about the courtroom
drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself
to stay out Huck was having the same experience They studiously
avoided each other Each wandered away from time to time but the same
dismal fascination always brought them back presently Tom kept his
ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom but invariably
heard distressing newsthe toils were closing more and more
relentlessly around poor Potter At the end of the second day the
village talk was to the effect that Injun Joes evidence stood firm and
unshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what the
jurys verdict would be
Tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window He
was in a tremendous state of excitement It was hours before he got to
sleep All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning for
this was to be the great day Both sexes were about equally represented
in the packed audience After a long wait the jury filed in and took
their places shortly afterward Potter pale and haggard timid and
hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all
the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was Injun Joe
stolid as ever There was another pause and then the judge arrived and
the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court The usual whisperings
among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed These
details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation
that was as impressive as it was fascinating
Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potter
washing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder
was discovered and that he immediately sneaked away After some
further questioning counsel for the prosecution said
Take the witness
The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when
his own counsel said
I have no questions to ask him
The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse
Counsel for the prosecution said
Take the witness
I have no questions to ask him Potters lawyer replied
A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potters
possession
Take the witness
Counsel for Potter declined to question him The faces of the audience
began to betray annoyance Did this attorney mean to throw away his
clients life without an effort
Several witnesses deposed concerning Potters guilty behavior when
brought to the scene of the murder They were allowed to leave the
stand without being crossquestioned
Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the
graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was
brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were crossexamined
by Potters lawyer The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house
expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench
Counsel for the prosecution now said
By the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we
have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question
upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar We rest our case here
A groan escaped from poor Potter and he put his face in his hands and
rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned in
the courtroom Many men were moved and many womens compassion
testified itself in tears Counsel for the defence rose and said
Your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we
foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed
while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium
produced by drink We have changed our mind We shall not offer that
plea Then to the clerk Call Thomas Sawyer
A puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even
excepting Potters Every eye fastened itself with wondering interest
upon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand The boy looked
wild enough for he was badly scared The oath was administered
Thomas Sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of June about the
hour of midnight
Tom glanced at Injun Joes iron face and his tongue failed him The
audience listened breathless but the words refused to come After a
few moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and
managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house
hear
In the graveyard
A little bit louder please Dont be afraid You were
In the graveyard
A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joes face
Were you anywhere near Horse Williams grave
Yes sir
Speak upjust a trifle louder How near were you
Near as I am to you
Were you hidden or not
I was hid
Where
Behind the elms thats on the edge of the grave
Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start
Any one with you
Yes sir I went there with
Waitwait a moment Never mind mentioning your companions name We
will produce him at the proper time Did you carry anything there with
you
Tom hesitated and looked confused
Speak out my boydont be diffident The truth is always
respectable What did you take there
Only aadead cat
There was a ripple of mirth which the court checked
We will produce the skeleton of that cat Now my boy tell us
everything that occurredtell it in your own waydont skip anything
and dont be afraid
Tom beganhesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his
words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased
but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips
and bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of
time rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale The strain upon
pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said
and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fell
Injun Joe jumped with the knife and
Crash Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore his
way through all opposers and was gone
CHAPTER XXIV
TOM was a glittering hero once morethe pet of the old the envy of
the young His name even went into immortal print for the village
paper magnified him There were some that believed he would be
President yet if he escaped hanging
As usual the fickle unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosom
and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before But that sort
of conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to find
fault with it
Toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights
were seasons of horror Injun Joe infested all his dreams and always
with doom in his eye Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to
stir abroad after nightfall Poor Huck was in the same state of
wretchedness and terror for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyer
the night before the great day of the trial and Huck was sore afraid
that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding
Injun Joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court
The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of
that Since Toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the
lawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been
sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths Hucks
confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated
Daily Muff Potters gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken but nightly
he wished he had sealed up his tongue
Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured the
other half he was afraid he would be He felt sure he never could draw
a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse
Rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no Injun
Joe was found One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a
detective came up from St Louis moused around shook his head
looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of
that craft usually achieve That is to say he found a clew But you
cant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got
through and gone home Tom felt just as insecure as he was before
The slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension
CHAPTER XXV
THERE comes a time in every rightlyconstructed boys life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure This
desire suddenly came upon Tom one day He sallied out to find Joe
Harper but failed of success Next he sought Ben Rogers he had gone
fishing Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the RedHanded Huck
would answer Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to
him confidentially Huck was willing Huck was always willing to take a
hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no
capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time
which is not money Wherell we dig said Huck
Oh most anywhere
Why is it hid all around
No indeed it aint Its hid in mighty particular places Huck
sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a
limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but
mostly under the floor in hanted houses
Who hides it
Why robbers of coursewhod you reckon Sundayschool
suprintendents
I dont know If twas mine I wouldnt hide it Id spend it and have
a good time
So would I But robbers dont do that way They always hide it and
leave it there
Dont they come after it any more
No they think they will but they generally forget the marks or
else they die Anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by
and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the
marksa paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because its
mostly signs and hyroglyphics
HyroQwhich
Hyroglyphicspictures and things you know that dont seem to mean
anything
Have you got one of them papers Tom
No
Well then how you going to find the marks
I dont want any marks They always bury it under a hanted house or
on an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out
Well weve tried Jacksons Island a little and we can try it again
some time and theres the old hanted house up the StillHouse branch
and theres lots of deadlimb treesdead loads of em
Is it under all of them
How you talk No
Then how you going to know which one to go for
Go for all of em
Why Tom itll take all summer
Well what of that Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred
dollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of dimonds
Hows that
Hucks eyes glowed
Thats bully Plenty bully enough for me Just you gimme the hundred
dollars and I dont want no dimonds
All right But I bet you I aint going to throw off on dimonds Some
of ems worth twenty dollars apiecethere aint any hardly buts
worth six bits or a dollar
No Is that so
Certnlyanybodyll tell you so Haint you ever seen one Huck
Not as I remember
Oh kings have slathers of them
Well I don know no kings Tom
I reckon you dont But if you was to go to Europe youd see a raft
of em hopping around
Do they hop
Hopyour granny No
Well what did you say they did for
Shucks I only meant youd SEE emnot hopping of coursewhat do
they want to hop forbut I mean youd just see emscattered around
you know in a kind of a general way Like that old humpbacked Richard
Richard Whats his other name
He didnt have any other name Kings dont have any but a given name
No
But they dont
Well if they like it Tom all right but I dont want to be a king
and have only just a given name like a nigger But saywhere you
going to dig first
Well I dont know Spose we tackle that old deadlimb tree on the
hill tother side of StillHouse branch
Im agreed
So they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their
threemile tramp They arrived hot and panting and threw themselves
down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke
I like this said Tom
So do I
Say Huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your
share
Well Ill have pie and a glass of soda every day and Ill go to
every circus that comes along I bet Ill have a gay time
Well aint you going to save any of it
Save it What for
Why so as to have something to live on by and by
Oh that aint any use Pap would come back to thishyer town some
day and get his claws on it if I didnt hurry up and I tell you hed
clean it out pretty quick What you going to do with yourn Tom
Im going to buy a new drum and a surenough sword and a red
necktie and a bull pup and get married
Married
Thats it
Tom youwhy you aint in your right mind
Waityoull see
Well thats the foolishest thing you could do Look at pap and my
mother Fight Why they used to fight all the time I remember mighty
well
That aint anything The girl Im going to marry wont fight
Tom I reckon theyre all alike Theyll all comb a body Now you
better think bout this awhile I tell you you better Whats the name
of the gal
It aint a gal at allits a girl
Its all the same I reckon some says gal some says girlboths
right like enough Anyway whats her name Tom
Ill tell you some timenot now
All rightthatll do Only if you get married Ill be more lonesomer
than ever
No you wont Youll come and live with me Now stir out of this and
well go to digging
They worked and sweated for half an hour No result They toiled
another halfhour Still no result Huck said
Do they always bury it as deep as this
Sometimesnot always Not generally I reckon we havent got the
right place
So they chose a new spot and began again The labor dragged a little
but still they made progress They pegged away in silence for some
time Finally Huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from
his brow with his sleeve and said
Where you going to dig next after we get this one
I reckon maybe well tackle the old tree thats over yonder on
Cardiff Hill back of the widows
I reckon thatll be a good one But wont the widow take it away from
us Tom Its on her land
SHE take it away Maybe shed like to try it once Whoever finds one
of these hid treasures it belongs to him It dont make any difference
whose land its on
That was satisfactory The work went on By and by Huck said
Blame it we must be in the wrong place again What do you think
It is mighty curious Huck I dont understand it Sometimes witches
interfere I reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now
Shucks Witches aint got no power in the daytime
Well thats so I didnt think of that Oh I know what the matter
is What a blamed lot of fools we are You got to find out where the
shadow of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you dig
Then consound it weve fooled away all this work for nothing Now
hang it all we got to come back in the night Its an awful long way
Can you get out
I bet I will Weve got to do it tonight too because if somebody
sees these holes theyll know in a minute whats here and theyll go
for it
Well Ill come around and maow tonight
All right Lets hide the tools in the bushes
The boys were there that night about the appointed time They sat in
the shadow waiting It was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by
old traditions Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked
in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the
distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note The boys were
subdued by these solemnities and talked little By and by they judged
that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to
dig Their hopes commenced to rise Their interest grew stronger and
their industry kept pace with it The hole deepened and still deepened
but every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike upon
something they only suffered a new disappointment It was only a stone
or a chunk At last Tom said
It aint any use Huck were wrong again
Well but we CANT be wrong We spotted the shadder to a dot
I know it but then theres another thing
Whats that
Why we only guessed at the time Like enough it was too late or too
early
Huck dropped his shovel
Thats it said he Thats the very trouble We got to give this
one up We cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of
things too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts
afluttering around so I feel as if somethings behind me all the time
and Im afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in front
awaiting for a chance I been creeping all over ever since I got here
Well Ive been pretty much so too Huck They most always put in a
dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it
Lordy
Yes they do Ive always heard that
Tom I dont like to fool around much where theres dead people A
bodys bound to get into trouble with em sure
I dont like to stir em up either Spose this one here was to
stick his skull out and say something
Dont Tom Its awful
Well it just is Huck I dont feel comfortable a bit
Say Tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else
All right I reckon we better
Whatll it be
Tom considered awhile and then said
The hanted house Thats it
Blame it I dont like hanted houses Tom Why theyre a dern sight
worsen dead people Dead people might talk maybe but they dont come
sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your
shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does I
couldnt stand such a thing as that Tomnobody could
Yes but Huck ghosts dont travel around only at night They wont
hender us from digging there in the daytime
Well thats so But you know mighty well people dont go about that
hanted house in the day nor the night
Well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans been
murdered anywaybut nothings ever been seen around that house except
in the nightjust some blue lights slipping by the windowsno regular
ghosts
Well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around Tom
you can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it It stands to
reason Becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em
Yes thats so But anyway they dont come around in the daytime so
whats the use of our being afeard
Well all right Well tackle the hanted house if you say sobut I
reckon its taking chances
They had started down the hill by this time There in the middle of
the moonlit valley below them stood the hanted house utterly
isolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very
doorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the windowsashes vacant a
corner of the roof caved in The boys gazed awhile half expecting to
see a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone as
befitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to the
right to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their way
homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of Cardiff
Hill
CHAPTER XXVI
ABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they had
come for their tools Tom was impatient to go to the haunted house
Huck was measurably so alsobut suddenly said
Lookyhere Tom do you know what day it is
Tom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted
his eyes with a startled look in them
My I never once thought of it Huck
Well I didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was
Friday
Blame it a body cant be too careful Huck We might a got into an
awful scrape tackling such a thing on a Friday
MIGHT Better say we WOULD Theres some lucky days maybe but
Friday aint
Any fool knows that I dont reckon YOU was the first that found it
out Huck
Well I never said I was did I And Friday aint all neither I had
a rotten bad dream last nightdreampt about rats
No Sure sign of trouble Did they fight
No
Well thats good Huck When they dont fight its only a sign that
theres trouble around you know All we got to do is to look mighty
sharp and keep out of it Well drop this thing for today and play
Do you know Robin Hood Huck
No Whos Robin Hood
Why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in Englandand the
best He was a robber
Cracky I wisht I was Who did he rob
Only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like
But he never bothered the poor He loved em He always divided up with
em perfectly square
Well he must a been a brick
I bet you he was Huck Oh he was the noblest man that ever was
They aint any such men now I can tell you He could lick any man in
England with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow
and plug a tencent piece every time a mile and a half
Whats a YEW bow
I dont know Its some kind of a bow of course And if he hit that
dime only on the edge he would set down and cryand curse But well
play Robin Hoodits nobby fun Ill learn you
Im agreed
So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon now and then casting a
yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the
morrows prospects and possibilities there As the sun began to sink
into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of
the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of Cardiff
Hill
On Saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again
They had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in
their last hole not with great hope but merely because Tom said there
were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting
down within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and
turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel The thing failed this
time however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feeling
that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the
requirements that belong to the business of treasurehunting
When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and
grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun
and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the
place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in Then they
crept to the door and took a trembling peep They saw a weedgrown
floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a
ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and
abandoned cobwebs They presently entered softly with quickened
pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound
and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat
In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the
place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own
boldness and wondering at it too Next they wanted to look upstairs
This was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring
each other and of course there could be but one resultthey threw
their tools into a corner and made the ascent Up there were the same
signs of decay In one corner they found a closet that promised
mystery but the promise was a fraudthere was nothing in it Their
courage was up now and well in hand They were about to go down and
begin work when
Sh said Tom
What is it whispered Huck blanching with fright
Sh  There  Hear it
Yes  Oh my Lets run
Keep still Dont you budge Theyre coming right toward the door
The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to
knotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear
Theyve stopped Nocoming Here they are Dont whisper
another word Huck My goodness I wish I was out of this
Two men entered Each boy said to himself Theres the old deaf and
dumb Spaniard thats been about town once or twice latelynever saw
tother man before
Tother was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant
in his face The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white
whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore
green goggles When they came in tother was talking in a low voice
they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the
wall and the speaker continued his remarks His manner became less
guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded
