OUR CHURCHES AND CHAPELS  THEIR PARSONS PRIESTS AND
CONGREGATIONS
It is important that something should be known about our churches
and chapels it is more important that we should be acquainted with
their parsons and priests it is most important that we should have
a correct idea of their congregations for they show the
consequences of each and reflect the character and influence of
all We have a wide field before us The domain we enter upon is
unexplored Our streets with their midday bustle and midnight sin
our public buildings with their outside elaboration and inside
mysteries our places of amusement with their gilded fascinations
and shallow delusions our clubs bar parlours prisons cellars
and workhouses with their amenities frivolities and severities
have all been commented upon but the most important of our
institutions the best the queerest the solemnest the oddestthe
churches and chapels of the townhave been left out in the cold
entirely All our public functionaries have been viewed round
examined closely caressed mildly and sometimes genteely
maltreated our parochial divinities who preside over the fate of
the poor our municipal Gogs and Magogs who exhibit the extreme
points of reticence and garrulity in the council chamber our brandy
drinkers chronic carousers lackered swells pushing shopkeepers
otiose policemen and dimlooking cabdrivers have all been
photographed framed and hung up to dry long ago our workshops and
manufactories our operatives and artisans have likewise been duly
pictured and exhibited the Ribble has had its praises sung in
polite literary strains the parks have had their beauties depicted
in rhyme and blank verse naybut this is hardly necessarythe old
railway station that walhallah of the gods and paragon of the five
orders of architecture has had its delightful peculiarities set
forth all our public places and public bodies have been thrown upon
the canvas except those of the more serious typeexcept places of
worship and those belonging them These have been neglected nobody
has thought it worth while to give them either a special blessing or
a particular anathema
There are about 45 churches and chapels and probably 60 parsons and
priests in Preston but unto this hour they have been treated so
far as they are individually concerned with complete silence We
purpose remedying the defect supplying the necessary criticism and
filling up the hiatus The whole lot must have either something or
nothing in them must be either useful or useless parsons must be
either sharp or stupid sensible or foolish priests must be either
learned or illiterate either good bad or indifferent in all
from the rector in his silken gown to the back street psalmsinger
in his fustian there must be something worth praising or
condemning And the churches and chapels with their congregations
must likewise present some points of beauty or ugliness some traits
of grace or godlessness some features of excellence dignity
piety or sham There must be either a good deal of gilded
gingerbread or a great let of the genuine article at our places of
worship But whether there is or there is not we have decided to
say something about the church and the chapel the parson and the
priest of each district in the town This is a mere prologue and
we shall but hint at the general theme on this occasion
Churches and chapels are great institutions in the land Nobody
knows the exact time when the first was thought of and it has not
yet transpired when the last will be run up But this is certain we
are not improving much in the make of them The Sunday sanctums and
Sabbath conventicles of today may be mere ornate may be more
flashy and show more symptoms of polished bedizenment in their
construction but threefourths of them sink into dwarflings and
mediocrities when compared with the rare old buildings of the past
In strength and beauty in vastness of design and skill of
workmanship in nobility of outline and richness of detail the
religious fabrics of these times fall into insignificance beside
their grand old predecessors and the manner in which they are cut
up into patrician and plebeian quarters into fashionable coteries
for the perfumed portion of humanity and into halfstarved benches
with the brand of poverty upon them for the poor is nothing to the
credit of anybody
All the churches and chapels of the land may profess Christianity
but the game of the bulk has a powerful reference to money Those
who have got the most of the current coin of the realm receive the
blandest smile from the parson the politest nod from the beadle
the promptest attention from that strange mixture of piety and pay
called the chapelkeeper those who have not got it must take what
they can get and accept it with Christian resignation as St Paul
tells them This may be all right we have not said yet that it is
wrong but it looks suspicious doesnt itshows that in the arena
of conventional Christianity as in the seething maelstrom of
ordinary life money is the winner Our parsons and priests like
our ecclesiastical architecture and general church management do
not seem to have improved upon their ancestors Priests are not as
jolly as they once were In olden days holy fathers could wear
horsehair shirts and scarify their epidermis with a finer cruelty
than their modern successors and they could after all that make
the blithest songs sing the merriest melodies and quaff the oldest
port with an air of jocund conscientiousness making one slyly like
them however much inclined to dispute the correctness of their
theology And the parsons of the past were also a blithesome set of
individuals They were perhaps rougher than those mild and refined
gentlemen who preach nowadays but they were straightforward
thorough absolutely English well educated and stronger in the
brain than many of them In each Episcopalian Catholic and
Dissenting community there are new some most erudite most useful
men but if we take the great multitude of them and compare their
circumstancestheir facilities for education the varied channels
of usefulness they havewith those of their predecessors it will
be found that the latter were the cleverer often the wiser and
always the merrier men Plainness erudition blithesomeness were
their characteristics Aye look at our modern men given up largely
to threnodychiming and to polishing off tea and muffin with elderly
females and compare them say for instance with
The poet Praeds immortal Vicar
Who wisely wore the cleric gown
Sound in theology and liquor
Quite human though a true divine
His fellowmen he would not libel
He gave his friends good honest wine
And drew his doctrine from the Bible
Institute a comparison and then you will say that whilst modern men
may be very aesthetic and neatly dressed the ancient apostolic
successors though less refined had much more metal in them were
more kindly genial and told their followers to live well to eat
well and to mind none of the hairsplitting neological folly which
is now cracking up Christendom In old times the Lord did not call
so many parsons from one church to another as it is said He does
now in the days which have passed the bulk of subordinate parsons
did not feel a sort of conscientious hankering every three years for
an enlarged sphere of usefulness where the salary was
proportionately increased We have known multitudes of parsons in
our time who have been called to places where their salaries were
increased we know of but few who have gravitated to a church where
the salary was less than the one left Business enters largely
into the conceptions of clergymen As a rule no teachers of
religion except Catholic priests and Methodist ministers leave one
place for another where less of this worlds goods and chattels
predominate and THEY are COMPELLED to do so else the result might
be different When a priest gets his mittimus he has to budge it is
not a question of he said or she said but ofgo and when a
Wesleyan is triennially told to either look after the interests of a
fresh circuit or retire into space he has to do so It would be
wrong to say that lucre is at the bottom of every parsonic change
but it is at the foundation of the great majorityeh If it isnt
just make an inquiry as we have done This may sound like a
deviation from our textperhaps it is but the question it refers
to is so closely associated with the subject of parsons and priests
that we should have scarcely been doing justice to the matter if we
had not had a quiet fling at the money part of it In the letters
which will follow this we shall deal disinterestedly with all
shall give Churchmen Catholics Quakers Independents Baptists
Wesleyans Ranters and Calathumpians fair play Our object will be
to present a picture of things as they are and to avoid all
meddling with creeds People may believe what they like so far as
we are concerned if they behave themselves and pay their debts It
is utterly impossible to get all to be of the same opinion creeds
like faces must differ have differed always will differ and the
best plan is to let people have their own way so long as it is
consistent with the general welfare of social and civil life It
being understood that the milk of human kindness is within the PALE
of the Church we shall begin there The Parish Church of Preston
will constitute our first theme
No I
PRESTON PARISH CHURCH
It doesnt particularly matter when the building we call our Parish
Church was first erected and if it did the world would have to
die of literary inanition before it got the exact date None of the
larger sort of antiquaries agree absolutely upon the subject and
the smaller fry go in for all sorts of figures varying as to time
from about two years to one hundred and fifty This may be taken as
a homoeopathic dose in respect to its history built about 900
years since by Catholics and dedicated to St Wilfrid handed over
to Protestants by somebody who was perhaps acting on the very
generous principle of giving other folks property in the 16th
century rebuilt in 1581 and dedicated to St John rebuilt in
1770 enlarged elaborated and rejuvenised in 1853 plagued with
dry rot for a considerable time afterwards in a pretty good state
of architectural health now and likely to last out both this
generation and the next It looks rather genteel and stately
outside it has a good steeple kept duly alive by a congregation of
traditional jackdaws it has a capital set of bells which have put
in a good deal of overtime during the past five months through a
pressure of election business and in its entirety as Baines once
remarked the building looks like a good ordinary Parish Church
There is nothing either snobbish or sublime about it and speaking
after Josh Billings its a fair evengoing critter capable of
being either pulled down or made bigger That is about the length
and breadth of the matter and if we had to appeal to the
commonwealth as to the correctness of our position it would be found
that the ayes have it We dont believe in the Parish Church but
a good deal of people do and why shouldnt they have their way in a
small fight as well as the rest of folk All except Mormons and
Fenians who honestly believe in anything are entitled to respect
Our Parish Church has a good contour and many of its exterior
architectural details are well conceived and arranged but like
other buildings of the same order it has got a multiplicity of
strange hobgoblin figureheads about it which serve no purpose
either earthly or heavenly and which are understood by hardly one
out of five million We could never yet make it out why those
grotesque pieces of masonrygargoyles we believe they are called
were fixed to any place of worship Around our Parish Church and
halfway up the steeple there are at almost every angle and
prominence rudely carved monstrosities conspicuous for nothing but
their ineffable and heathenish ugliness Huge eyes great mouths
immense tooth savage faces and distorted bodies are their prime
characteristics The man who invented this species of ecclesiastical
decoration must have been either mad or in the horrors An evenly
balanced mind could never have thought of them and why they should
he specially tacked to churches is a mystery in accordance with
neither King Solomon nor Cocker The graveyard of our Parish Church
is we dare say something which very few people think of We have
seen many such places in our time but that in connection with our
Parish Church is about the grimmest specimen in the lot It has a
barren cold dingy unconsecrated look with it and why it should
have we cant tell Either ruffianism or neglect must at some time
have done a good stroke of business in it for many of the
gravestones are cracked in two some are nearly broken to pieces
and a considerable number of those in the principal parts of the
yard are being gradually worn out We see no fun for instance in
paving the entrances to the church with gravestones Somebody
must at some time have paid a considerable amount of money in
getting the gravestones of their relatives smoothed and lettered
and it could never have been intended that they should be flattened
down close as tile work for a promiscuous multitude of people to
walk over and efface The back of the churchyard is in a very weary
delapidated and melancholy state Why cant a few shrubs and flowers
be planted in it Why is not the ground trimmed up and made decent
From the time when the Egyptians worshipped cats and onions down to
the present hour religious folk have paid some special attention to
their grave spaces and we want to see the custom kept up Our
Parish Church yard has a sad forsaken appearance if it had run to
seed and ended in nothing or had been neglected and closed up by an
army of hypochondriacs it could not have been more gloomy barren
or disheartening The ground should be looked after and the stones
preserved as much as possible It is a question of shoes v
gravestones at present and if there is not some change of
position the shoes will in the end win
About the interior of our Parish Church there is nothing
particularly wonderful it has a respectable substantial
reverential appearance and that is quite as much as any church
should have There is no emblematic ritualistic moonshine in any
part of it we hope there never may be we are sure there never will
be so long as the men now at the helm are in office But let us
start at the beginning The principal entrance is through a massive
and somewhat dimlylighted porch which in its time has
necessarily like all church porches been the scene of much pious
gossip superstition and sanctimonious scandal It is rather a snug
place to halt in If you stand on one side of the large octagonal
font which is placed in the centre of the inner perch and
patronised by about 20 of the rising race every Sunday afternoon
you will be able to see everybody whilst nobody can distinctly see
you As a rule many people are too fired or too ill or too idle
to go to a place of worship on a Sunday morning and at our Parish
Church one may plainly notice this A certain number always put in a
regular appearance If they did not attend the Parish Church twice a
day they would become apprehensive as to both their temporal
respectability awl spiritual welfare They are descendants of the
old longhorned stock and have a mighty notion of the importance of
churchgoing Probably they dont care very profoundly for the
sermons but they have got into a safesided orthodox groove and
some of them have an idea that they will be saved as much by church
going as by faith The members of this class have a large notion of
the respectability of their individual pews and seats If they
belonged to a family of five hundred each and if every one of them
had to go to Church every Sunday they would want their respective
seats Prayer Books footstools and all that sort of thing They
dont like to see strangers rambling about in search of a resting
place they are particularly solemnlooking and give symptoms of
being on the border of some catastrophe if an unknown being shows
any disposition to enter their pews And some of them would see a
person a good deal beyond the ether side of Jordan before they would
think of handing him a Prayer Book We dont suppose any of them are
so precise as the old gentleman who once when a stranger entered
his pew doubled up the cushion sat upon it in a twofold state
and intimated that ordinary beards were good enough for interlopers
but after all there is much of the number one principle in the
devotion of these goodly followers of the saints and they have been
so long at the game that a cure is impossible
Taking the congregation of our Parish Church in the agregate it is a
fair sample of every class of human life You have the old maid in
her unspotted demurelycoloured moire antique carrying a Prayer
Book belonging to a past generation you have the ancient bachelor
with plenty of money and possessing a thorough knowledge as to the
safest way of keeping it his great idea being that the best way of
getting to heaven is to stick to his coins attend church every
Sunday and take the sacrament regularly you have the magistrate
whose manner if not his beard is of formal cut the retired
tradesman with his domestic looking wife and smartlydressed
daughters ten times finer than ever their mother was the
manufacturer absorbed in cotton and wondering when he will be able
to do a good stroke of business on change again the lawyer who
has carried on a decent business amongst fees during the week and
has perhaps turned up to join in the general confession the doctor
ready to give emphasis to that part of it which says And there is
no health in us the pushing tradesman who has to live by going to
church as well as by counter work the speculating shopkeeper who
has a connection to make the young finelyfeathered lady got up in
silk and velvet and carrying a chignon sufficient to pull her
cerebellum out of joint the dandy buttoned up to show his figure
and heavily dosed with scent the less developed young swell who is
always talking about his pa and his ma and has only just begun to
have his hair parted down the middle the broken down middleaged
man who was once in a good position but who years since went all in
a piece to pot the snuffloving old woman who curtsies before fine
folk who has always a long tale to tell about her sorrows and who
is periodically consoled by a trifle the working man who is
rather a scarce article except upon special occasions and the
representative of the poorest class living somewhere in that venal
slum of slime and misery behind the church A considerable number of
those floating beings called strags attend the Parish Church They
go to no place regularly they gravitate at intervals to the church
mainly on the ground that their fathers and mothers used to go
there and because they were christened there but they belong a
cunning race they can scent the battle from afar and they
generally keep about threequarters of a mile from the Parish Church
when a collection has to be made To the ordinary attendants
collections do not operate as deterrents but to the strags they
are frighteners Whats the reason there are so few people here
we said one day to the beadle and that most potent grave and
reverend seignior replied with a Rogersonian sparkle in his rolling
eye Theres a collection and the strags wont take the bait It
is the same more or less at every place of worship and to tell the
truth theres a sort of instinctive dislike of collections in
everybodys composition
The congregation of our Parish Church is tolerably numerous and
embraces many fine human specimens Money and fashion are well
represented at it and as Zadkiel and the author of Pogmoor Almanac
say those powers have to rule for a long time we may take it for
granted that the Parish Church will yet outlive many of the minor
raving academies in which they are absent There is touch more
generalisation than there used to be as to the sittings in our
Parish Church but birds of a feather flock together still The
rich know their quarters exquisite gentlemen and smart young ladies
with morroccobound giltedged Prayer Books still cluster in special
sections and although it is said that the poor have the best part
of the church allotted to them the conspicuousness of its position
gives a brand to it neither healthy nor pleasant They are seated
down the centre aisle but the place is too demonstrative of their
poverty If half the seats were empty situated excellently though
they may be you wouldnt catch any respectable weasle asleep on
them If some doctor or magistrate or private bibandtucker lady
had to anchor here supposing there were any spare place in any
other part of the house there would be a good deal of quizzing and
wonderment afloat If you dont believe it put on a highly refined
dress and try the experiment and if you are not very specially
spotted we wild give a fifty dollar greenback on behalf of the
society for converting missionary eaters in Chillingowullabadorie
We shall say nothing with regard to the ordinary service of the
Parish Church except this that it would look better of three
fourths of the congregation if they would not leave the responses to
a paid choir Lor bless yer as Betsy Jane Ward would say a
choir will sing anything put before them if it is set to music and
they think no more of getting through all that sad business about
personal sinfulness agonising repentance and a general craving for
forgiveness than the odd woman did when she used to kiss her cow
and say it was delicious There was once a period when all Parish
Church goers made open confession joined audibly in the prayers and
said Amen as if they meant it although we are doubtful about even
that Now the choir does all the work and the congregation are
left behind the distance post to think about the matter But if it
suits the people its quite right
There are three parsons at our Parish ChurchCanon Parr who is the
seventeenth vicar in a regular line of succession since the
Reformation and two curates As to the curates we shall say nothing
beyond this that one has got a better situation and is going to it
and that the other would like one if he could get itnot that the
present is at all bad only that there are others better We dont
know how many curates there have been at the Parish Church since the
Reformation but it may be safely said that in their turn they
have as a rule accepted with calm and Christian resignation better
paid places when they had a fair opportunity of getting them We are
not going to say very much about Cannon Parr and let nobody suppose
that we shall make an effort to tear a passion to tatters regarding
any of his peculiarities Canon Parr is an easygoing genial
educated man kindly disposed towards good living not blessed with
over much money fond of wearing a billycock and strongly in love
with a cloak He has seen much of the world is shrewd has a long
head has both studied and travelled for his learning and is the
smartest man Preston Protestants could have to defend their cause
But he has a certain amount of narrowness in his mental vision and
like the bulk of parsons can see his own way best He has a strong
temper within him and he can redden up beautifully all over when
his equanimity is disturbed If you tread upon his ecclesiastical
bunions he will give you either a dark mooner or an eye openerwe
use these classical terms in a figurative sense He will keep quiet
so long as you do but if you make an antagonistic move be will
punish you if possible He can wield a clever pen his style is
cogent scholarly and unless overburdened with temper dignified
He can fling the shafts of satire or distil the balm of pathos can
be bitter saucy and aggravating can say a hard thing in a cutting
style and if he does not go to the bone its no fault of his He
can also tone down his language to a point of elegance and
tenderness can express a good thing excellently and utter a fine
sentiment well His speaking is modelled after a good style but it
is inferior to his writing In the pulpit he expresses himself
easily often fervently never rantingly The pulpit of the Parish
Church will stand for ever before he upsets it and he will never
approach that altitude of polemical phrenitis which will induce him
to smash any part of it His pulpit language is invariably well
chosen some of his subjects may be rather commonplace or
inappropriate but the words thrown into their exposition are up to
the mark He seldom falters he has never above one and now
finally brethren in his concluding remarks he invariably gives
over when he has donea plan which John Wesley once said many
parsons neglected to observe and his congregation whether they
have been awake or fast asleep generally go away satisfied Canon
Parr has been at our Parish Church nine and twenty years and
although we dont subscribe to his ecclesiastical creed we believe
he has done good in his time He is largely respected he would have
been more respected if he had been less exacting towards Dissenters
and less violent in his hatred of Catholics Neither his Churchrate
nor Easter Due escapade improved his position and some of his
fierce antiPopery denunciations did not increase his circle of
friends But these things have gone by and let them be forgotten
In private life Canon Parr is essentially social  he can tell a
good tale is full of humour he knows a few things as well as the
rest of men and is charitably disposedindeed he is too
sympathetic and this causes hint to be pestered with rubbishy tales
from all sorts of individuals and sometimes to act upon them as if
they were true As a Protestant vicarand remembering that no
angels have yet been born in this country that everybody is
somewhat imperfect and that folk will differwe look upon Canon
Parr as above the average He has said extravagant and unreasonable
things in his time but he has rare properties qualities of sense
and erudition which are strangers to many pretentious men in his
line of business and on the whole he may be legitimately set
down in the language of the gods as OK
No II
ST WILFRIDS CATHOLIC CHURCH
It was at one time of the day a rather dangerous sort of thing for a
man or a woman or a mediumsized infant living in this highly
favoured land of ours to show any special liking for Roman
Catholicism But the days of religious bruising have perished and
Catholics are now in the main considered to be human as well as
other people and to have a right to live and put their Sunday
clothes on and go to their own places of worship like the rest of
mortals No doubt there are a few distempered adherents of the
immortal William school who would like to see Catholics driven
into a corner banished or squeezed into nothing probably there
are some of the highly sublimated no surrender gentlemen who would
be considerably pleased if they could galvanise the old penal code
and put a barrel able to play the air of Boyne Water into every
street organ but the great mass of men have learned to be tolerant
and have come to the conclusion that Catholics civilly and
religiously are entitled to all the liberty which a free and
enlightened constitution can conferto all the privileges which
fairplay and evenhanded justice call give and if these are not
fully granted now the day is coming when they will be possessed
Lancashire seems to be the great centre of Catholicism in England
and Preston appears to be its centre in Lancashire This benign town
of Preston with its fervent galaxy of lecturing curates and its
noble army of high falutin incumbents is the very fulcrum and
lever of northern Romanism If Catholics are wrong and on the way to
perdition and blisters there are 33000 of them here moving in that
very awkward direction at the present A number so large whether
right or wrong cannot he despised a body so great whether good or
evil will by its sheer inherent force persist in living moving
and having a fair share of being You cant evaporate 33000 of
anything in a hurry and you could no more put a nightcap upon the
Catholics of Preston than you could blacken up the eye of the sun
That stout old Vatican gentleman who storms this fast world of ours
periodically with his encyclicals and who is known by the name of
Pius IX must if he knows anything of England know something of
Preston and if he knows anything of it he will have long since
learned that wherever the faith over which he presides may be going
down the hill it is at least in Preston as well as can be
expected and likely for a period longer than be will live to
bloom and flourish
Our text isSt Wilfrids Catholic Church Preston This place of
worship is situated in a somewhat sanctified placeChapelstreet
but as about half of that locality is taken up with lawyers
offices and the centre of it by a police station we fancy that
this world rather than the next will occupy the bulk of its
attention It is to be hoped that St Wilfrids which stands on the
