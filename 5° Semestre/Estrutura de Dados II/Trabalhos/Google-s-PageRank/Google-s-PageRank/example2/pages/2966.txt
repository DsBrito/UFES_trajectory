begets assurance and the wish is father to the thought I cast a hungry
gaze on this young lady without more ado just as if all the women in
Europe were only a seraglio kept for my pleasures I told the baron I
should like to know her
She is a good girl said he who sees no company and is quite poor
Those are three reasons which make me the more anxious to know her
You will really find nothing to do in that quarter
Very good
There is her aunt I will introduce you to her as we leave the
concertroom
After doing me this service he came to sup with me The doorkeeper and
cook struck me as being very like Lebel He made his two pretty daughters
wait on me and I saw that Valenglard was delighted at having lodged me
to my satisfaction but he grumbled when he saw fifteen dishes
He is making a fool of you and me he said
On the contrary he has guessed my tastes Dont you think everything
was very good
I dont deny it but
Dont be afraid I love spending my money
I beg your pardon I only want you to be pleased
We had exquisite wines and at dessert some ratafia superior to the
Turkish visnat I had tasted seventeen years before at Yussuf Alis
When my landlord came up at the end of supper I told him that he ought
to be Louis XVs head cook
Go on as you have begun and do better if you can but let me have your
bill every morning
You are quite right with such an arrangement one can tell how one is
getting on
I should like you always to give me ices and you must let me have two
more lights But unless I am mistaken those are candles that I see I
am a Venetian and accustomed to wax lights
That is your servants fault sir
How is that
Because after eating a good supper he went to bed saying he was ill
Thus I heard nothing as to how you liked things done
Very good you shall learn from my own lips
He asked my wife to make chocolate for you tomorrow morning he gave her
the chocolate I will make it myself
When he had left the room M de Valenglard said in a manner that was at
the same time pleased and surprised that Madame dUrfe had been
apparently joking in telling him to spare me all expense
Its her goodness of heart I am obliged to her all the same She is an
excellent woman
We stayed at table till eleven oclock discussing in numerable pleasant
topics and animating our talk with that choice liqueur made at Grenoble
of which we drank a bottle It is composed of the juice of cherries
brandy sugar and cinnamon and cannot be surpassed I am sure by the
nectar of Olympus
I sent home the baron in my carriage after thanking him for his
services and begging him to be my companion early and late while I
stayed at Grenoblea re quest which he granted excepting for those days
on which he was on duty At supper I had given him my bill of exchange on
Zappata which I endorsed with the name de Seingalt which Madame dUrfe
had given me He discounted it for me next day A banker brought me four
hundred louis and I had thirteen hundred in my cashbox I always had a
dread of penuriousness and I delighted myself at the thought that M de
Valenglard would write and tell Madame dUrfe who was always preaching
economy to me what he had seen I escorted my guest to the carriage and
I was agreeably surprised when I got back to find the doorkeepers two
charming daughters
Le Duc had not waited for me to tell him to find some pretext for not
serving me He knew my tastes and that when there were pretty girls in a
house the less I saw of him the better I was pleased
The frank eagerness of the two girls to wait on me their utter freedom
from suspicion or coquetry made me determine that I would shew myself
deserving of their trust They took off my shoes and stockings did my
hair and put on my nightgown with perfect propriety on both sides When
I was in bed I wished them a goodnight and told them to shut the door
and bring me my chocolate at eight oclock next morning
I could not help confessing that I was perfectly happy as I reflected
over my present condition I enjoyed perfect health I was in the prime
of life I had no calls on me I was thoroughly independent I had a rich
store of experience plenty of money plenty of luck and I was a
favourite with women The pains and troubles I had gone through had been
followed by so many days of happiness that I felt disposed to bless my
destiny Full of these agreeable thoughts I fell asleep and all the
night my dreams were of happiness and of the pretty brunette who had
played with me at the concert
I woke with thoughts of her and feeling sure that we should become
acquainted I felt curious to know what success I should have with her
She was discreet and poor and as I was discreet in my own way she ought
not to despise my friendship
At eight oclock one of the doorkeepers daughters brought me my
chocolate and told me that Le Duc had got the fever
You must take care of the poor fellow
My cousin has just taken him some broth
What is your name
My name is Rose and my sister is Manon
Just then Manon came in with my shirt on which she had put fresh lace I
thanked her and she said with a blush that she did her fathers hair
very well
I am delighted to hear it and I shall be very pleased if you will be
kind enough to do the same offices for me till my servant recovers
With pleasure sir
And I said Rose laughing will shave you
I should like to see how you do it get the water
I rose hastily while Manon was preparing to do my hair Rose returned
and shaved me admirably As soon as she had washed off the lather I
said
You must give me a kiss presenting my cheek to her She pretended not
to understand
I shall be vexed said I gravely but pleasantly if you refuse to
kiss me
She begged to be excused saying with a little smile that it was not
customary to do so at Grenoble
Well if you wont kiss me you shant shave me
The father came in at that point bringing his bill
Your daughter has just shaved me admirably said I and she refuses to
kiss me because it is not the custom at Grenoble
You little silly said he it is the custom in Paris You kiss me fast
enough after you have shaved me why should you be less polite to this
gentleman
She then kissed me with an air of submission to the paternal decree which
made Manon laugh
Ah said the father your turn will come when you have finished doing
the gentlemans hair
He was a cunning fellow who knew the best way to prevent me cheapening
him but there was no need as I thought his charges reasonable and as I
paid him in full he went off in great glee
Manon did my hair as well as my dear Dubois and kissed me when she had
done without making as many difficulties as Rose I thought I should get
on well with both of them They went downstairs when the banker was
announced
He was quite a young man and after he had counted me out four hundred
Louis he observed that I must be very comfortable
Certainly said I the two sisters are delightful
Their cousin is better They are too discreet
I suppose they are well off
The father has two thousand francs a year They will be able to marry
welltodo tradesmen
I was curious to see the cousin who was said to be prettier than the
sisters and as soon as the banker had gone I went downstairs to satisfy
my curiosity I met the father and asked him which was Le Ducs room and
thereon I went to see my fine fellow I found him sitting up in a
comfortable bed with a rubicund face which did not look as if he were
dangerously ill
What is the matter with you
Nothing sir I am having a fine time of it Yesterday I thought I would
be ill
What made you think that
The sight of the three Graces here who are made of better stuff than
your handsome housekeeper who would not let me kiss her They are making
me wait too long for my broth however I shall have to speak severely
about it
Le Duc you are a rascal
Do you want me to get well
I want you to put a stop to this farce as I dont like it Just then
the door opened and the cousin came in with the broth I thought her
ravishing and I noticed that in waiting on Le Duc she had an imperious
little air which well became her
I shall dine in bed said my Spaniard
You shall be attended to said the pretty girl and she went out
She puts on big airs said Le Duc but that does not impose on me
Dont you think she is very pretty
I think you are very impudent You ape your betters and I dont approve
of it Get up You must wait on me at table and afterwards you will eat
your dinner by yourself and try to get yourself respected as an honest
man always is whatever his condition so long as he does not forget
himself You must not stay any longer in this room the doorkeeper will
give you another
I went out and on meeting the fair cousin I told her that I was jealous
of the honour which she had done my man and that I begged her to wait on
him no longer
Oh I am very glad
The doorkeeper came up and I gave him my orders and went back to my
room to write
Before dinner the baron came and told me that he had just come from the
lady to whom he had introduced me She was the wife of a barrister named
Morin and aunt to the young lady who had so interested me
I have been talking of you said the baron and of the impression her
niece made on you She promised to send for her and to keep her at the
house all day
After a dinner as good as the supper of the night before though
different from it in its details and appetising enough to awaken the
dead we went to see Madame Morin who received us with the easy grace of
a Parisian lady She introduced me to seven children of whom she was the
mother Her eldest daughter an ordinarylooking girl was twelve years
old but I should have taken her to be fourteen and said so To convince
me of her age the mother brought a book in which the year the month the
day the hour and even the minute of her birth were entered I was
astonished at such minute accuracy and asked if she had had a horoscope
drawn
No said she I have never found anybody to do it
It is never too late I replied and without doubt God has willed that
this pleasure should be reserved for me
At this moment M Morin came in his wife introduced me and after the
customary compliments had passed she returned to the subject of the
horoscope The barrister sensibly observed that if judicial astrology was
not wholly false it was nevertheless a suspected science that he had
been so foolish as once to devote a considerable portion of his time to
it but that on recognizing the inability of man to deal with the future
he had abandoned astrology contenting himself with the veritable truths
of astronomy I saw with pleasure that I had to deal with a man of sense
and education but Valenglard who was a believer in astrology began an
argument with him on the subject During their discussion I quietly
copied out on my tablets the date of Mdlle Morins birth But M Morin
saw what I was about and shook his head at me with a smile I
understood what he meant but I did not allow that to disconcert me as I
had made up my mind fully five minutes ago that I would play the
astrologer on this occasion
At last the fair niece arrived Her aunt introduced me to her as Mdlle
Roman Coupier her sisters daughter and then turning to her she
informed her how ardently I had been longing to know her since I had seen
her at the concert
She was then seventeen Her satin skin by its dazzling whiteness
displayed to greater advantage her magnificent black hair Her features
were perfectly regular and her complexion had a slight tinge of red her
fine eyes were at once sweet and sparkling her eyebrows were well
arched her mouth small her teeth regular and as white as pearls and
her lips of an exquisite rosy hue afforded a seat to the deities of
grace and modesty
After some moments conversation M Morin was obliged to go out on
business and a game of quadrille was proposed at which I was greatly
pitied for having lost a louis I thought Mdlle Roman discreet
judicious pleasant without being brilliant and still better without
any pretensions She was highspirited eventempered and had a natural
art which did not allow her to seem to understand too flattering a
compliment or a joke which passed in any way the bounds of propriety
She was neatly dressed but had no ornaments and nothing which shewed
wealth neither earrings rings nor a watch One might have said that
her beauty was her only adornment the only ornament she wore being a
small gold cross hanging from her necklace of black ribbon Her breast
was well shaped and not too large Fashion and custom made her shew half
of it as innocently as she shewed her plump white hand or her cheeks
whereon the lily and the rose were wedded I looked at her features to
see if I might hope at all but I was completely puzzled and could come
to no conclusion She gave no sign which made me hope but on the other
hand she did nothing to make me despair She was so natural and so
reserved that my sagacity was completely at fault Nevertheless a
liberty which I took at supper gave me a gleam of hope Her napkin fell
down and in returning it to her I pressed her thigh amorously and could
not detect the slightest displeasure on her features Content with so
much I begged everybody to come to dinner with me next day telling
Madame Morin that I should not be going out and that I was therefore
delighted to put my carriage at her service
When I had taken Valenglard home I went to my lodging building castles
in Spain as to the conquest of Mdlle Roman
I warned my landlord that we should be six at dinner and supper the
following day and then I went to bed As Le Duc was undressing me he
said
Sir you are punishing me but what makes me sorry you are punishing
yourself in depriving yourself of the services of those pretty girls
You are a rogue
I know it but I serve you with all my heart and I love your pleasure
as well as my own
You plead well for yourself I am afraid I have spoilt you
Shall I do your hair tomorrow
No you may go out every day till dinnertime
I shall be certain to catch it
Then I shall send you to the hospital
That is a fine prospect por Dios
He was impudent sly profligate and a rascally fellow but also
obedient devoted discreet and faithful and his good qualities made me
overlook his defects
Next morning when Rose brought my chocolate she told me with a laugh
that my man had sent for a carriage and after dressing himself in the
height of fashion he had gone off with his sword at his side to pay
calls as he said
We laughed at him
You were quite right my dear Rose
As I spoke Manon came in under some pretext or other I saw that the two
sisters had an understanding never to be alone with me I was displeased
but pretended not to notice anything I got up and I had scarcely put on
my dressinggown when the cousin came in with a packet under her arm
I am delighted to see you and above all to look at your smiling face
for I thought you much too serious yesterday
Thats because M le Duc is a greater gentleman than you are I should
not have presumed to laugh in his presence but I had my reward in seeing
him start off this morning in his gilded coach
Did he see you laughing at him
Yes unless he is blind
He will be vexed
All the better
You are really very charming What have you got in that parcel
Some goods of our own manufacture Look they are embroidered gloves
They are beautiful the embroidery is exquisitely done How much for the
lot
Are you a good hand at a bargain
Certainly
Then we must take that into account
After some whisperings together the cousin took a pen put down the
numbers of gloves added up and said
The lot will cost you two hundred and ten francs
There are nine louis give me six francs change
But you told us you would make a bargain
You were wrong to believe it
She blushed and gave me the six francs Rose and Manon shaved me and did
my hair giving me a kiss with the best grace imaginable and when I
offered my cheek to the cousin she kissed me on the mouth in a manner
that told me she would be wholly mine on the first opportunity
Shall we have the pleasure of waiting on you at the table said Rose
I wish you would
But we should like to know who is coming to dinner first as if it is
officers from the garrison we dare not come they make so free
My guests are Madame Morin her husband and her niece
Very good
The cousin said Mdlle Roman is the prettiest and the best girl in
Grenoble but she will find some difficulty in marrying as she has no
money
She may meet some rich man who will think her goodness and her beauty
worth a million of money
There are not many men of that kind
No but there are a few
Manon and the cousin went out and I was left alone with Rose who stayed
to dress me I attacked her but she defended herself so resolutely that
I desisted and promised it should not occur again When she had finished
I gave her a louis thanked her and sent her away
As soon as I was alone I locked the door and proceeded to concoct the
horoscope I had promised to Madame Morin I found it an easy task to fill
eight pages with learned folly and I confined myself chiefly to
declaring the events which had already happened to the native I had
deftly extracted some items of information in the course of conversation
and filling up the rest according to the laws of probability and dressing
up the whole in astrological diction I was pronounced to be a seer and
no doubts were cast on my skill I did not indeed run much risk for
everything hung from an if and in the judicious employment of ifs lies
the secret of all astrology
I carefully reread the document and thought it admirable I felt in the
vein and the use of the cabala had made me an expert in this sort of
thing
Just after noon all my guests arrived and at one we sat down to table I
have never seen a more sumptuous or more delicate repast I saw that the
cook was an artist more in need of restraint than encouragement Madame
Morin was very polite to the three girls whom she knew well and Le Duc
stood behind her chair all the time looking after her wants and dressed
as richly as the kings chamberlain When we had nearly finished dinner
Mdlle Roman passed a compliment on my three fair waitingmaids and this
giving me occasion to speak of their talents I got up and brought the
gloves I had purchased from them Mdlle Roman praised the quality of the
material and the work I took the opportunity and begged leave of the
aunt to give her and her niece a dozen pair apiece I obtained this
favour and I then gave Madame Morin the horoscope Her husband read it
and though an unbeliever he was forced to admire as all the deductions
were taken naturally from the position of the heavenly bodies at the
instant of his daughters birth We spent a couple of hours in talking
about astrology and the same time in playing at quadrille and then we
took a walk in the garden where I was politely left to enjoy the society
of the fair Roman
Our dialogue or rather my monologue turned solely on the profound
impression she had made on me on the passion she had inspired on her
beauty her goodness the purity of my intentions and on my need of
love lest I should go down to the grave the most hapless of men
Sir said she at last if my destiny points to marriage I do not deny
that I should be happy to find a husband like you
I was emboldened by this frank declaration and seizing her hand I
covered it with fiery kisses saying passionately that I hoped she would
not let me languish long She turned her head to look for her aunt It
was getting dark and she seemed to be afraid of something happening to
her She drew me gently with her and on rejoining the other guests we
returned to the diningroom where I made a small bank at faro for their
amusement Madame Morin gave her daughter and niece whose pockets were
empty some money and Valenglard directed their play so well that when
we left off to go to supper I had the pleasure of seeing that each of the
three ladies had won two or three louis
We sat at table till midnight A cold wind from the Alps stopped my plan
of proposing a short turn in the garden Madame Morin overwhelmed me with
thanks for my entertainment and I gave each of my ladyvisitors a
respectful kiss
I heard singing in the kitchen and on going in I found Le Duc in a high
state of excitement and very drunk As soon as he saw me he tried to
rise but he lost his centre of gravity and fell right under the kitchen
table He was carried away to bed
I thought this accident favourable to my desire of amusing myself and I
might have succeeded if the three Graces had not all been there Love
only laughs when two are present and thus it is that the ancient
mythology tells no story of the loves of the Graces who were always
together I had not yet found an opportunity of getting my three maids
one after the other and I dared not risk a general attack which might
have lost me the confidence of each one Rose I saw was openly jealous
of her cousin as she kept a keen lookout after her movements I was not
sorry for jealousy leads to anger and anger goes a long way When I was
in bed I sent them away with a modest good night
Next morning Rose came in by herself to ask me for a cake of chocolate
for as she said Le Duc was now ill in real earnest She brought me the
box and I gave her the chocolate and in doing so I took her hand and
shewed her how well I loved her She was offended drew back her hand
sharply and left the room A moment after Manon came in under the
pretext of shewing me a piece of lace I had torn away in my attempts of
the day before and of asking me if she should mend it I took her hand
to kiss it but she did not give me time presenting her lips burning
with desire I took her hand again and it was just on the spot when the
cousin came in Manon held the piece of lace and seemed to be waiting
for my answer I told her absently that I should be obliged if she would
mend it when she had time and with this she went out
I was troubled by this succession of disasters and thought that the
cousin would not play me false from the earnest of her affection which
she had given me the day before in that ardent kiss of hers I begged her
to give me my handkerchief and gently drew her hand towards me Her
mouth fastened to mine and her hand which she left to my pleasure with
all the gentleness of a lamb was already in motion when Rose came in
with my chocolate We regained our composure in a moment but I was
furious at heart I scowled at Rose and I had a right to do so after the
manner in which she had repulsed me a quarter of an hour before Though
the chocolate was excellent I pronounced it badly made I chid her for
her awkwardness in waiting on me and repulsed her at every step When I
got up I would not let her shave me I shaved myself which seemed to
humiliate her and then Manon did my hair Rose and the cousin then went
out as if to make common cause together but it was easy to see that
Rose was less angry with her sister than her cousin
As Manon was finishing my toilette M de Valenglard came in As soon as
we were alone the officer who was a man of honour and of much sense in
spite of his belief in astrology and the occult sciences said that he
thought me looking rather melancholy and that if my sadness had any
connection with the fair Roman he warned me to think no more of her
unless I had resolved to ask her hand in marriage I replied that to put
an end to all difficulties I had decided on leaving Grenoble in a few
days We dined together and we then called on Madame Morin with whom we
found her fair niece
Madame Morin gave me a flattering welcome and Mdlle Roman received me
so graciously that I was emboldened to kiss her and place her on my knee
The aunt laughed the niece blushed and then slipping into my hand a
little piece of paper made her escape I read on the paper the year day
Hour and minute of her birth and guessed what she meant She meant I
thought that I could do nothing with her before I had drawn up her
horoscope My resolve was soon taken to profit by this circumstance and
I told her that I would tell her whether I could oblige her or not next
day if she would come to a ball I was giving She looked at her aunt and
my invitation was accepted
Just then the servant announced The Russian Gentleman I saw a
wellmade man of about my own age slightly marked with the smallpox
and dressed as a traveller He accosted Madame Morin with easy grace was
welcomed heartily by her spoke well scarcely gave me a glance and did
not say a word to the nieces In the evening M Morin came in and the
Russian gave him a small phial full of a white liquid and then made as
if he would go but he was kept to supper
At table the conversation ran on this marvellous liquid of his M Morin
told me that he had cured a young man of a bruise from a billiard ball in
five minutes by only rubbing it with the liquid He said modestly that
it was a trifling thing of his own invention and he talked a good deal
about chemistry to Valenglard As my attention was taken up by the fair
Mdlle Roman I could not take part in their conversation my hope of
succeeding with her on the following day absorbed all my thoughts As I
was going away with Valenglard he told me that nobody knew who the
Russian was and that he was nevertheless received everywhere
Has he a carriage and servants
He has nothing no servants and no money
Where did he come from
From the skies
A fair abode certainly how long has he been here
For the last fortnight He visits but asks for nothing
How does he live
On credit at the inn he is supposed to be waiting for his carriage and
servants
He is probably a vagabond
He does not look like one as you saw for yourself and his diamonds
contradict that hypothesis
Yes if they are not imitation stones for it seems to me that if they
were real he would sell them
When I got home Rose came by herself to attend on me but she continued
to sulk I tried to rouse her up but as I had no success I ordered her
to go and tell her father that I was going to give a ball next day in the
room by the garden and that supper was to be laid for twenty
When the doorkeeper came to take my orders the following morning I told
him that I should like his girls to dance if he didnt mind At this Rose
condescended to smile and I thought it a good omen Just as she went out
with her father Manon came in under the pretext of asking me what lace I
would wear for the day I found her as gentle as a lamb and as loving as
a dove The affair was happily consummated but we had a narrow escape of
being caught by Rose who came in with Le Duc and begged me to let him
dance promising that he would behave himself properly I was glad that
everybody should enjoy themselves and consented telling him to thank
Rose who had got him this favour
I had a note from Madame Morin asking me if she might bring with her to
the ball two ladies of her acquaintance and their daughters I replied
that I should be delighted for her to invite not only as many ladies but
as many gentlemen as she pleased as I had ordered supper for twenty
people She came to dinner with her niece and Valenglard her daughter
being busy dressing and her husband being engaged till the evening She
assured me that I should have plenty of guests
The fair Mdlle Roman wore the same dress but her beauty unadorned was
dazzling Standing by me she asked if I had thought about her horoscope
I took her hand made her sit on my knee and promised that she should
have it on the morrow I held her thus pressing her charming breasts
with my left hand and imprinting fiery kisses on her lips which she
only opened to beg me to calm myself She was more astonished than afraid
to see me trembling and though she defended herself successfully she did
not lose countenance for a moment and in spite of my ardent gaze she did
not turn her face away I calmed myself with an effort and her eyes
expressed the satisfaction of one who has vanquished a generous enemy by
the force of reason By my silence I praised the virtue of this celestial
being in whose destiny I only had a part by one of those caprices of
chance which philosophy seeks to explain in vain
Madame Morin came up to me and asked me to explain some points in her
daughters horoscope She then told me that if I wanted to have four
beauties at my ball she had only to write a couple of notes
I shall only see one beauty said I looking at her niece
God alone knows said Valenglard what people will say in Grenoble
They will say it is your wedding ball said Madame Morin to her niece
Yes and they will doubtless talk of my magnificent dress my lace and
my diamonds said the niece pleasantly
They will talk of your beauty your wit and your goodness I replied
passionately goodness which will make your husband a happy man
There was a silence because they all thought I was alluding to myself I
was doing nothing of the sort I should have been glad to give five
hundred louis for her but I did not see how the contract was to be drawn
up and I was not going to throw my money away
We went to my bedroom and while Mdlle Roman was amusing herself with
looking at the jewellry on my toilettetable her aunt and Valenglard
examined the books on the table by my bedside I saw Madame Morin going
to the window and looking closely at something she held in her hand I
