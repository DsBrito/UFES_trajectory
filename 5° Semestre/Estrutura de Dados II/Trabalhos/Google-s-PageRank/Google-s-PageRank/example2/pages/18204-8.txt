be diverted into moneymaking purposes
So absorbing is the hobby that in stamp circles there is a saying
Once a stamp collector always a stamp collector

As a Pastime
According to the authorities the central idea of a pastime is that
it is so positively agreeable that it lets time slip by unnoticed as
to turn work into pastime And recreation is described as that sort
of play or agreeable occupation which refreshes the tired person
making him as good as new
Stamp collectors may fairly claim that their hobby serves the double
purpose of a pastime and a recreation As a pastime it certainly
makes time pass most agreeably for the true student of the postal
issues of the world it turns work into a pastime As a recreation it
is of such an engrossing character that it may be relied upon to
afford the pleasant diversion from business worries that so many tired
mental workers need nowadays
For nearly half a century it has maintained unbroken its hold as one
of the most popular of all forms of relaxation and its popularity
extends to all classes and to all countries
But this very devotion of stamp collectors to their hobby has puzzled
and excited the uninitiated The ordinary individual especially the
man who has no soul for a hobby of any kind regards it as a passing
fancy a harmless craze a fashion that must have its day and
disappear sooner or later But the passing fancy has endured for
nearly half a century the harmless craze still serves its useful
purpose and the fashion has acquired such a permanence as to convince
most people that it has come to stay
Of all pastimes and of all the forms of recreation not one can claim
more lifelong devotees than this same stamp collecting And where is
another pastime with such international ramifications In every
civilised country in every city and in every town of any importance
the wide world over thoughtful men and women are to be found formed
into sociable groups or societies quietly and pleasantly enjoying
themselves in the harmless and enduring pursuit of stamp collecting
There must be some reason for this popularity this devotion of all
classes to a pursuit this unbroken record of progress It cannot be
satisfactorily accounted for as a passing fancy or fashion It has too
long stood the test of years to be so easily explained away Fancies
and fashions come and go but stamp collecting flourishes from decade
to decade Princes and peers merchants and members of Parliament
solicitors and barristers schoolboys and octogenarians all follow
this postal Pied Piper of Hamelin
Grave old plodders gay young friskers Fathers mothers uncles
cousins
all bent upon the pursuit of this pleasureyielding hobby
Why is it Whence comes the fascination
To the unprejudiced inquirer the reply is simple To the leisured man
it affords a stimulating occupation with a spice of competition to
the busy professional man it yields the delight of a recreative
change to the studious an inexhaustible scope for profitable
research to the old the sociability of a pursuit popular with old
and young alike to the young a hobby prolific of novelty and one
moreover that harmonises with school studies in historical and
geographical directions to the money maker an opening for occasional
speculation and to all a satisfying combination of a safe investment
and a pleasureyielding study
Old postage stampsbits of paper as they are contemptuously called
by some peoplemay have no intrinsic value but they are
nevertheless rich in memories of history and of art they link the
past with the present they mark the march of empires and the
federation of states the rise and fall of dynasties and the peaceful
extension of postal communication between the peoples of the world
and some day in the distant future they may celebrate even yet more
important victories of peace

The Charm of Stamp Collecting
His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in a letter to a
correspondent referring to stamp collecting wrote It is one of the
greatest pleasures of my life and the testimony of the Prince of
Wales is the testimony of thousands who have taken up this engrossing
hobby
The pursuit of a hobby is very often a question of expense Many
interesting lines of collecting are practically closed to all but the
wealthy But stamp collecting is open to all for the expenditure may
in its case be limited at the will of the collector to shillings or
pounds Indeed the adaptability of this hobby is one of its chiefest
charms The rich collector may make his choice amongst the most
expensive countries whilst the man of moderate means will wisely
confine himself to equally interesting countries whose stamps have not
gone beyond the reach of the man who does not wish to make his hobby
an expensive one The schoolboy may get together a very respectable
little collection by the judicious expenditure of small savings from
his pocket money and the millionaire will find ample scope for his
surplus wealth in the fine range of varieties that gem the issues of
many of the oldest stampissuing countries and which only the
fortunate few can hope to possess
In all there are over three hundred countries from which to make a
selection In the early days collectors took all countries but as
country after country followed the lead of England in issuing adhesive
stamps for the prepayment of postage and as series followed series of
new designs in each country the task of covering the whole ground
became more and more hopeless and collector after collector began
first to restrict his lines to continents and then to groups or
countries till now only the wealthy and leisured few attempt to make
a collection of the worlds postal issues
This necessary restriction of collecting to groups and individual
countries has led to specialism The specialist concentrates his
attention upon the issues of a group or country and he prosecutes the
study of the stamps of his chosen country with all the thoroughness of
the modern specialist He unearths from forgotten State documents and
dusty files of official gazettes the official announcements
authorising each issue He inquires into questions surrounding the
choice of designs the why and wherefore of the chosen design the
name of the engraver the materials and processes used in the
production of the plates the size of the plates and the varying
qualities of the paper and ink used for printing the stampsin fact
nothing that can complete the history of an issue from its inception
to its use by the public escapes his attention He constitutes
himself in truth the historian of postal issues The scope for
interesting study thus opened up is almost boundless It includes
inquiries into questions of heraldry in designs of currency in the
denominations used of methods of engraving dies of the transference
of the die to plates of printing from steel plates and from
lithographic stones of the progress of those arts in various
countries of the manufacture the variety and the quality of the
paper usedfrom the excellent handmade papers of early days to the
commonest printing papers of the present dayof postal revenues and
postal developments of the crude postal issues of earliest times and
the exquisite machine engraving of many current issues
He who fails to see any justification for money spent and time given
up to the collecting of postage stamps will scarcely deny that these
lines of study which by no means exhaust the list can scarcely fail
to be both fascinating and profitable even when regarded from a
purely educational standpoint It is true it may be contended that all
collectors do not go thus deeply into stamp collecting as a study
nevertheless the tendency sets so strongly in the direction of
combining study with the pleasure of collecting that the man who
nowadays neglects to study his stamps is apt to fall markedly behind
in the competition that is ever stimulating the stamp collector in his
pleasant and friendly rivalry with his fellows
Then again an everincreasing supply of new issues from one or other
of the many groups of stampissuing countries periodically revives the
interest of the flagging collector and binds him afresh to the hobby
of his choice Old seasoned collectors whose interest once set never
flags from youth to age relegate new issues to a back seat They find
more than enough to engage their lifelong devotion in the grand old
issues of the early settlements But the collector of modern issues
who cannot afford to indulge in the great rarities finds new issues a
source of perpetual enjoyment They follow one another month after
month and infuse into the collectors life the irresistible charm of
novelty and every now and again an emergency issue comes as a
surprise There is a scramble for possession and a spice of
speculation in the possibility never absent from a makeshift and
emergency issue that the copies may be scarce and may some day ripen
into rarity

Its Permanence
Ever since the collection of postage stamps was first started it has
been sneered at as a passing craze and it has been going to die a
natural death for the past forty years But it is not dead yet
Indeed it is very much more alive than it has ever been Still the
sneerers sneer on and the false prophets continue to prophesy its
certain end
To the unsympathetic the ignoramus the lethargic the brainless
everything that savours of enthusiasm is a craze The politician who
throws himself heart and soul into a political contest is off his
head is seized with a craze The philanthropist who builds and
endows hospitals and churches is a crank following a mere craze
The earnest student of social problems is off the track on a craze
The man who seeks relaxation by any change of employment is certain to
be classed by some idiot as one who goes off on a craze You cannot
in fact step off the beaten track tramped by the common herd without
exciting some remark some sneer perchance at your singularity
The most ignorant are the most positive that stamp collecting is only
a passing fancy of which its votaries will tire sooner or later and
yet for the last forty years with a brief exception due to an
abnormal depression in trade it has always been on the increase
Indeed it has never in all those years been more popular with the
cultured classes than it is today The Philatelic Society of London
has an unbroken record of regular meetings of its members extending
over a quarter of a century The literature devoted to stamp
collecting is more abundant than that of any other hobby Its votaries
are to be found in every city and town of the habitable globe
All very fine say our bogey men our prophets of impending evil
but blue china has gone to the wall autographs are losing caste old
books and first editions are on the downgrade pipes are relegated to
the lumberroom metallurgical cabinets are coated with dust and even
walkingsticks survive only at Sandringham Just so We are
allGovernments people and weathergoing to the bad as fast as we
can go according to the croakers the wiseacres and the
selfappointed prophets Nevertheless stamp collecting has survived
the sneers and the evil prophecies of forty years and so far as human
foresight can penetrate the future it seems likely to survive for
many a generation yet
And why not In the busy contentious bustle of the competition of the
day the brain strained too often to its utmost tension demands the
relaxation of some absorbing pleasureyielding hobby Those who have
tried it attest the fact that few things more completely wean the
attention for the time being from the vexations and worries of the
day than the collection and arrangement of postage stamps In fact
stamp collecting has an everrecurring freshness all its own a scope
for research that is never likely to be exhausted a literature varied
and abundant and a close and interesting relation to the history and
progress of nations and peoples that insensibly widens the trend of
human sympathies and human knowledge
What more do we want of a hobby We cannot ensure even for the
British Empire an eternity of durability nations decay and fashions
change Some day even stamp collecting may be superseded by a more
engrossing hobby The indications however are all in favour of its
growing hold upon its universal public The wealth invested in it is
immense its trading interests are prosperous and international and
no fear of changing fashion disturbs either dealer or collector

Its Internationality
Wherever you go you find the stamp collector in evidence The hobby
has its devotees in every civilised country Its hold is in fact
international In Dresden there is a society with over two thousand
members upon its books in outoftheway countries like Finland there
are ardent collectors and flourishing philatelic societies The Prince
of Siam has been an enthusiastic collector for many years and even in
Korea there are followers of the hobby Australia numbers its
collectors by the thousand and many of its cities have their
philatelic societies all keen searchers for the muchprized rarities
of the various States of the Commonwealth In India despite the
difficulty of preserving stamps from injury by moisture there are
numbers of collectors one of the bestknown rajahs is collecting
stamps for a museum recently founded in his State and the Parsees
are keen dealers There are collectors throughout South Africa in
Rhodesia and even in Uganda Wherever a postage stamp is issued there
may be found a collector waiting for a copy for his album In no part
of the world can an issue of stamps be made that is not at once
partially bought up for collectors If any one of the Antarctic
expeditions were to reach the goal of its ambition and were to
celebrate the event there and then by an issue of postage stamps a
collector would be certain to be in attendance and would probably
endeavour to buy up the whole issue on the spot The United States
teems with collectors and they have their philatelic societies in the
principal cities and their Annual Congress From Texas to Niagara and
from New York to San Francisco the millionaire and the more humble
citizen vie with each other in friendly rivalry as stamp collectors
Many countries are now making an Official Collection and there is
every probability that some day in the near future most Governments
will keep a stamp collection of some sort for reference and
exhibition Under the rules of the Postal Union every state that
enters the Union is entitled to receive for reference purposes a
copy of every stamp issued by each country in the Postal Union Hence
every Government receives valuable contributions which should be
utilised in the formation of a National or Official Collection And
some day stamp collectors will be numerous and influential enough to
demand that such contributions shall not be buried in useless and
forgotten heaps in official drawers but shall be systematically
arranged for public reference and general study
Not a few countries are every year rescued from absolute bankruptcy by
the generosity with which collectors buy up their postal issues and
many other countries would have to levy a very much heavier burden of
taxation from their peoples if stamp collecting were to go out of
fashion
So widespread indeed is our hobby that a wellknown collector might
travel round the world and rely upon a cordial welcome at the hands of
fellowcollectors at every stoppingplace en route
International jealousies are forgotten and even the barriers of race
and creed and politics in the pleasant freemasonry of philatelic
friendships

Its Geographical Interest
A few years ago many heads of colleges prohibited stamp collecting
amongst their boys They found they were carrying it too far and were
being made the easy prey of a certain class of rapacious dealers Now
the pendulum is swinging in a more rational direction and many
masters themselves having become enthusiastic collectors judiciously
encourage the boys under their care to collect and study stamps as
interesting aids to their general studies They watch over their
collecting and protect them from wasteful buying In some schools the
masters have given or arranged lectures on stamps and stamp
collecting and the boys have voted such entertainments as ranking
next to a jolly holiday
The uptodate master who can associate work and play study and
entertainment is much more likely to register successes than the
frigid dominie who will hear of nothing but a rigid attention to the
tasks of the day In the one case the lessons are presented in their
most repellent form in the other they are made part and parcel of
each days pleasant round of interesting study
The genuine success of the Kindergarten system in captivating the
little ones lies in its association of play with work The same
principle holds good even to a much later age The more pleasant the
task can be made the more ready will be the obedience with which the
task will be performed The openings for the judicious and helpful
admixture of study and entertainment are so few that one wonders that
such a helpful form of play as stamp collecting has not become more
popular than it has in our colleges
Take for example the study of geography so important to the boys of
a great commercial nation The boy who collects stamps will readily
separate the great colonising powers and group and locate their
separate colonies How many other boys even after they have passed
through the last stage of their school life could do this
Littleknown countries and states are too often a puzzle to the
ordinary schoolboy which are familiar places to the stamp collecting
youth Ask the ordinary schoolboy in which continents are such places
as Angola Annam Curacao Funchal Holkar Ivory Coast Liberia
Nepaul Reunion St Lucia San Marino Sarawak Seychelles Sirmoor
Somali Coast Surinam Tahiti Tobago or Tonga and how many of all
these places so familiar to the young stamp collector will he
properly place Not many and the same question might probably be
asked of many an adult with even less satisfaction
The average series of used stamps are now so cheap that a lad may get
together a fairly representative collection for what he ordinarily
spends at the tuck shop Some educationists have advocated the making
and exhibiting of school collections of stamps as aids to study Such
collections would certainly be much more profitably studied than most
of the maps and diagrams that nowadays cover the walls
With few exceptions every stamp has the name of the country or
colony of its issue on its face and most colonial stamps bear some
family likeness to the stamps of the mother country Our British
colonial stamps are distinguished by their Queens heads the stamps
of Portugal and its colonies by the portraits of the rulers of
Portugal those of Germany by the German currency those of France
mostly by French heraldic designs those of Spain by the portraits of
the kings and queens of Spain So that the postage stamp is a key to
much definite valuable and practical information

Its Historical Finger Posts
When considered from the historical point of view postage stamps
attain their highest level of educational value They are finger posts
to most of the great events that have made the history of nations
during the last fifty years Here are a few out of many examples which
might be quoted
The introduction of adhesive stamps for the prepayment of postage
found France a Republic A provisional government had just been
established on the ruins of the monarchy which had been swept out of
existence in the revolution of 1848 As a consequence the first
postage stamp issued by France on New Years Day of 1849 bore the
head of Ceres emblematic of Liberty Three years later Louis Napoleon
seized the post of power and as President of the Republic his head
figures on a stamp issued in 1851 under the inscription REPUB
FRANC Two years later the Empire was reestablished and the words
REPUB FRANC were changed to EMPIRE FRANC over the same head In
1863 the customary laurel wreath to indicate the first victories of
the reign won in the war with Austria was added to the Emperors
head In 1870 the FrancoGerman War resulted in the downfall of the
monarchy and the head of Liberty reappears on a series of postage
stamps issued in Paris during its investment by the German army The
issue of the stamps of Alsace and Lorraine in 1870 marks the
annexation of the conquered territory
Italy in 1850 was a land of many petty states each more or less a law
unto itself and each in the fifties issuing its own separate series
of postage stamps The stamps of the Pontifical States are made
familiar by their typical design of a tiara and keys and pompous King
Bomba ordered the best engraver to be found to immortalise him in a
portrait for a series of stamps The other states had each its own
heraldic design till the foundations of the Kingdom of Italy were
laid in 185960 by the union of the LombardoVenetian States the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies the Grand Duchy of Tuscany the Duchies
of Parma and Modena the Romagna and the Roman or Pontifical States
with Piedmont The first issue of stamps of the newly formed kingdom
bore a portrait of King Victor Emmanuel II with profile turned to the
right In 1863 after the Kingdom of Sardinia had been merged in the
Kingdom of Italy a new series was issued for united Italy The same
kings portrait appears but turned to the left In 1879 King Humbert
succeeded Victor Emmanuel and his portrait appeared on an issue in
the year of his accession The assassination of King Humbert and the
accession of his son as Victor Emmanuel III are followed by the new
portrait of the new king on the current series of the stamps of Italy
The stamps of Germany tell a somewhat similar story They mark the
stages of gradual absorption into a confederation of states and the
ultimate creation of a German Empire The postal issues of Baden
ceased in 1871 when the Grand Duchy was incorporated in the Empire
Bavaria though also incorporated holds out in postal matters and
still issues its separate series Bergedorf was in 1867 placed under
the control of the free city of Hamburg and thereupon ceased issuing
stamps Bremen Brunswick Hamburg Lubeck MecklenburgStrelitz
Oldenburg Prussia Saxony and SchleswigHolstein formed the North
German Confederation and closed their postal accounts with collectors
in 1868 Hanover became a province of Prussia after the war of 1866
and thereupon ceased its separate issue of postage stamps and Thurn
and Taxis followed suit in 1867 In 1870 the North German
Confederation was merged in the German Empire which issued its first
postage stamp with the Imperial eagle in 1872 But the Empire is not
yet sufficiently united to place a portrait of the Emperor upon its
Imperial postal series
Indian postage stamps overprinted with the initials CEF for the
China Expeditionary Force ie the Indian troops sent to China in
1901 to relieve the besieged Embassies mark an historical event of no
small import
The early provisional issues of Crete of 1898 indicate the joint
interference of the Great Powers in its affairs and the later issues
in 1900 bear the portrait of Prince George of Greece as High
Commissioner of Crete
The Confederate locals of America issued in 18613 by the
postmasters of the Southern States when they were cut off by the war
from the capital and its supplies of postage stamps and each town was
thrown upon its own resources proclaim the period of the great
American Civil War
Collectors are all familiar with the long series of portraits of past
Presidents of the United States from Washington to Garfield
The stamps of Don Carlos mark the Carlist rising in Spain in 1873
But amongst the most interesting of all stamps that may be classed as
historical finger posts none equal in presentday interest the stamps
of the Transvaal for they tell of the struggle for supremacy in South
Africa In 1870 the Boers issued their first postage stamp and a
crude piece of workmanship it was designed and engraved in Germany
Till 1877 they printed their supplies of postage stamps in their own
crude way from the same crude plates Then came the first British
Occupation when the remainders of the stamps of the first South
African Republic were overprinted VR TRANSVAAL to indicate
British government Then in 1878 the stamps of the Republic were
replaced by our Queens Head In 1881 the country was given back to
the Boers when they in turn overprinted our Queens Head series in
Boer currency to indicate the restoration of Boer domination And
now finally in 1900 we have the second British Occupation and a
second overprinting of South African Republic stamps VRI to
signalise once more and finally the supremacy of British rule in
South Africa The Mafeking stamps are also interesting souvenirs of a
gallant stand in the same historical struggle
The war which Chili some years ago carried into Bolivia and Peru has
been marked in a special manner upon the postage stamps of Chili As
in the case of our own troops in South Africa so the Chilian troops
in Bolivia and Peru were allowed to frank their letters home with the
stamps of their own country So also the Chilians further overprinted
the stamps of Peru with the Chilian arms during their occupation of
the conquered country in the years 18812 Chilian stamps used along
the route of the conquering army and postmarked with the names of the
towns occupied are much sought after by specialists These postmarks
include Arica Callao Iquique Lima Paita Pisagua Pisco Tacna
Yca etc
And so the stamp collector may turn over the pages of his stamp album
and point to stamp after stamp that marks for him some development
of art some crisis in a countrys progress some struggle to be free
or some great upheaval amongst rival powers In fact every stamp
issued by a country is more or less a page of its history

Stamps with a History
There are numbers of stamps that have an interesting history of their
own They mark some official experiment some curious blunder or
accident some little conceit some historical event or some crude
and early efforts at stamp production
What is known as the VR Penny black English stamp is said to have
been designed as an experiment in providing a special stamp for
official use its official character being denoted by the initials
VR in the upper corners but the proposal was dropped and the VR
Penny black was never issued For a long time it was treasured up as a
rarity by collectors but now that its real claims to be regarded as
an issued stamp have been finally settled it is no longer included in
our stamp catalogues In the days of its popularity it fetched as much
as 14 at auction It is now relegated to the rank of an interesting
souvenir of the experimental stage in the introduction of Penny
Postage
Of curious blunders the Cape of Good Hope errors of colours are
amongst the most notable In 1861 the 1d and 4d triangular stamps
then current were suddenly exhausted and before a stock could be
obtained from the printers in England a temporary supply had to be
provided locally This was done by engraving imitations of the
originals Stereos were then taken and made up into plates for
printing By an oversight a stereo of the penny value was dropped into
the fourpenny plate and a fourpenny into the penny plate
Consequently each sheet printed in the required red ink from the
penny plate yielded a fourpenny wrongly printed in red instead of
blue its proper colour and every sheet of the fourpenny likewise
yielded a penny stamp printed in blue instead of red These errors are
highly prized by collectors and are now extremely scarce even poor
specimens fetching from 50 to 60 At the time copies were sold by
dealers for a few shillings each Similar errors are known in the
stamps of other countries
Now and again the sheets of a particular value have by some
extraordinary oversight been printed and issued in the wrong colour
In 1869 copies of the 1s of Western Australia were printed in bistre
instead of in green and a few years later the twopence was discovered
in lilac instead of yellow In 1863 a supply of shilling stamps was
sent out to Barbados printed in blue instead of black but this latter
error was according to Messrs Hardy and Bacon so promptly
discovered that it is doubtful if any of the wrong colour were issued
for postal use In 1896 the fastidiously careful firm of De la Rue and
Co printed off and despatched to Tobago a supply of 6000 one
shilling stamps in the colour of the sixpenny ie in orangebrown
instead of oliveyellow Several are said to have been issued to the
public before the error had been noticed Indeed the firm at home is
credited with having first discovered the mistake and is said to
have telegraphed to the colony in time to prevent their issue in any
quantity
Another and much more common error in the early days of stamp
production was the careless placing of one stamp on a plate upside
