I thought the cruel wound was whole
Which left my inside so dyspeptic
That Time had salved this tortured soul
Time and Oblivions antiseptic
That thirty years the period since
You showed a preference for Another
Had fairly schooled me not to wince
At being treated like a brother
When last I saw the shape I wooed
In coils of adipose embedded
Fondling its eldest offsprings brood
The image of the Thing you wedded
I placed my hand upon the seat
Of those affections you had riven
And gathered from its steady beat
That your offence had been forgiven
And now to my surprise and pain
Long past the stage of convalescence
The wound has broken out again
With symptoms of pronounced putrescence
And from the spot where once was laid
Your likeness treasured in a locket
The trouble threatens to invade
A tenderer placemy trouser pocket
For AUSTEN such is rumours tale
Faced with a rude financial deadlock
Is bent on mulcting every male
Who shirks the privilege of wedlock
With such a hurt Time cannot deal
And Lethe here affords no tonic
Nothing but Death can hope to heal
What looks as if it must be chronic
And yet a solace soothes my brow
Making my air a shade less gloomy
Six shillings in the pound is now
The figure out of which they do me
But were we man and wife today
So close the Treasury loves to link em
A grievous supertax theyd lay
On our coagulated income
I dare not even try to guess
What is the charge for being single
It may be more it may be less
Than if we twain had chanced to mingle
But though with thrice as heavy a fist
They fall on bachelors to bleed em
Yet when I think of what Ive missed
Ill gladly pay the cost of Freedom

STRANGE BIGAMY STORY
MUNITIONER SAID TO HAVE POSED AS A WEALTHY MAN
Evening News
The strange thing of course is that he should have needed to pose
THE TRAGEDY OF THE SUPERPATRIOT
If you happen to be standing upon the platform of Ealing Common
station at about nine oclock on a weekday morning you will see a
poor shrunken figure with a hunted expression upon his face come
creeping down the stairs And as the train comes in he will slink into
a carriage and hide himself behind his newspaper and great tears will
come into his eyes as he reads the correspondence column and thinks of
the days when his own letters used to be published over the signatures
of Volunteer Patriot or Special Constable of Two Years
Service And this sorry figure is Mr Coaster whose patriotism
proved his undoing
Before he lived in Ealing he had a little cottage at Ramstairs on the
Kentish coast Every morning he would travel up to the City and every
evening he would return to Ramstairs not to the carpet slippers and
the comforts of home but to the brassard and the rigorous routine of
the drillhall
And the little drillhall was filled with the noise of war as the Men
of Kent marched hither and thither lashed by the caustic tongue of
the Territorial sergeant with all the enthusiasm of the early Saxons
who flocked to HAROLDS standard in order to repel the Danes
For Mr Coaster was as great a patriot as any of the old Saxons In a
burst of enthusiasm he joined the Special Constables in an explosion
of wrath following the bombardment of Scarborough he enlisted in the
Kentish Fencibles and in a wave of selfsacrifice he enrolled himself
in the Old Veterans Fire Brigade And he had badges upon each lapel
of his coat and several dotted all over his waistcoat
He belonged to a noble company of patriots All true Men of Kent who
were past the fighting age joined one or other of these institutions
but luckily not more than one
On a certain fatal night a general alarm was given In due course a
notification of it was conveyed to Ramstairs and instantaneously the
members of the Special Constabulary the Kentish Fencibles and the
Veterans Fire Brigade were summoned from their beds Then did Mr
Coaster realise his terrible position Since he belonged to all three
to which of them should he now report After some agonising moments of
doubt he hung up his three types of headgear upon the hatstand and
shutting his eyes he twirled himself round twice and made a grab at
them His hand touched the helmet of the Veterans Fire Brigade Fate
had decided Seizing his firemans axe he rushed off down the street
The result of this was inevitable He was dismissed with ignominy
from the Special Constables and was condemned to death with a
recommendation to mercy by a courtmartial of the Kentish Fencibles
His old friends among the Men of Kent cut him dead the tradesmen of
his platoon refused to serve him He had to leave Ramstairs and he
retired to Ealing The catastrophe ruined his health But he still
gets a little solace when as he wipes the tears from his eyes after
reading the correspondence column of his penny paper he sees upon his
waistcoat the crossed axes surmounted by a fire bucket the emblem of
the Veterans Fire Brigade

ILLUSTRATION BATTALION INSPECTION IN FRANCE
MEN ARE BEING DEMOBILISED FASTER THAN OFFICERS
CLEAR THE GALLERIES
In response to the growth of dissatisfaction at the continued closing
of certain picture galleries and museums either wholly or in part
the Government has appointed a special commission to investigate the
matter under the presidency of Sir Tite Barnacle fifth baronet A
report of the first session follows during which the cases for the
public and culture and for the Government as against both were fully
stated
The first witness was Lord HARCOURT who said that he had done all he
could both in the House of Lords and in the columns of The Times
where he was glad to say large type was given him to bring the
Government to its senses on this matter So long as the War was on he
and his fellowcritics had refrained from interfering But now that
it was over they demanded that the museums and galleries should be
cleared at once of flappers and typewriters and thrown open again to
their rightful users the public
Sir Buffer Stayte KCB OBE speaking for his own Government
department said that although in a manner of speaking the War was
over it was also not over There was a heritage of trouble which
required endless attention and the best place to attend to it was in
the museums and galleries Experience had taught them that buildings
filled with works of art acquired by the nation either by purchase
or gift for the nation and held as a national trust were the most
suitable places in which a clerical staff could perform clerical
duties
Lord HARCOURT begged to suggest that such a disregard of a national
trust was a treachery
Sir Buffer Stayte said that although in ordinary times such might be
the case it was not so in wartime or while the Defence of the
Realm Act was in force Under Doras sanction all black was white
Personally he had every belief in the efficiency of the staffs now
employed in the various public galleries and museums He had seen them
arrive late and leave earlyhe meant arrive early and leave lateand
could not sufficiently admire their willingness to put up with the
dismal surroundings of pictures and curiosities
Mr ROBERT WITT one of the Trustees of the National Gallery said
that it was inconceivable to him as a business man that even if so
many clerks should still be required there was not a more reasonable
place for them than Trafalgar Square
Sir Thomas Tannin KBE speaking for his own Government department
said that it was evident that Mr WITT did not fully realise the
position These were historic and abnormal times and abnormal measures
were necessary We thought in high numbers and therefore high numbers
of clerks were needed Trafalgar Square was as conveniently central a
spot as could be found hence their presence there It had also been
pointed out by the chiefs of the Government Clerks Tea Advisory Board
that the facilities for obtaining more water for boiling were unusual
on account of the proximity of the two great fountains If anybody
could suggest a better place for the accommodation of all these young
ladies he would be glad to know of it The only suggestion yet made
had reference to buildings which having been designed for office
work were obviously unsuitable Another reason for keeping them on
was their cost Economy in one direction might lead to economy
in another and the whole fabric of the now bureaucracy would be
threatened It was therefore useless to hope for any early change
Sir SIDNEY LEE pointed out that owing to the occupation of a large
part of the National Gallery all the National Portrait Gallery all
the Tate Gallery and all Hertford House where the Wallace Collection
is by Government clerks these national institutions were not open
to our soldiers from the Dominions and the provinces who might never
again have the opportunity of refreshing their eyes by gazing upon
some of our most beautiful possessions In their interest alone he
pleaded for the rapid conversion of the buildings to their proper
ends
Sir Yutely Taryan KCVO speaking for his own Government
Department said that in his opinion a great deal of nonsense was
talked about art both its educational value and its power of giving
pleasure Speaking for himself even in normal times he would rather
see a picture gallery given up to living clerks than to dead canvases
If he had his way there should be no pictures but those that
stimulated people to greater activity He had for example never seen
any beauty in WHISTLERS portrait of his WHISTLERS mother until it
was reproduced as a Warsavings poster with words scrawled across it
A few of the placards which American business men pinned up in their
offices such as To Hell with Yesterday were better than all the
Old Masters
Continuing Sir Yutely said that he could not permit himself to accept
the view that any privation was being suffered by our brave lads from
overseas From conversations that he had had with some of them he
found that the only pictures that they knew anything of or cared about
were those in the cinemas From his own recollections of his only
visit to the National Gallery some years ago he should say that these
noble fellows were better outside that place than in One painting
that he saw there was so scandalous in its nudity that he blushed even
now when he thought of it Better far that our defenders from the
Dominions should continue to walk up and down the Strand
On the motion of the Chairman who said that he thought the case for
the Government and the continued closing of the galleries and museums
had been adequately made out the Commission adjourned sine die and
Lord HARCOURT Sir SIDNEY LEE and Mr WITT were left sharpening their
pens

THE MUD LARKS
The Visiting Brigadier cracked a walnut and glanced towards the
General I wonder if you remember a French interpreter by the name of
de Blavincourt Sir He was with you once I believe
The APM across the way paused in the act of tapping a cigarette on
his case Little gunner man wore red plush bags and a blue velvet
hat Yes up in the salient in 17
The General puffed three perfect smoke rings towards the chandelier
an accomplishment he had acquired thirtyfive years previously at the
Shop and was still proud of and smiled De Blavincourt why yes
I remember him He knew more about cooking than all the chefs in
Europe and taught my poisoner to make rations taste like food Of
course I remember him Why
Because he came my way just at the end of the War and had rather
a curious adventure said the Brigadier stirring his coffee I
thought you might be interested
I am the General replied What happened
The Brigadier cleared his throat We were in front of Tournai at the
time scrapping our way from house to house through Faubourg de Lille
the citys western suburb My Brigade Major stumped into HQ one
afternoon looking pretty grim Wed best move out of here Sir said
he before were wafted
Whats the matter now I asked
That unutterable little fool de Blavincourt has walked into Germany
with a large scalemap in his hand showing every HQ mess and
billet He tapped a despatch from the forward battalion
De Blavincourt it appeared had been at work all the morning
evacuating unfortunate civilians from the cellars At noon or
thereabouts he sidled along the wall past a Lewis gun detachment
that was holding the street The corporal shouted a warning but de
Blavincourt sidled on saying that he was only going to the first
house round the corner to rescue some old women he heard were in it
And that was the last of him Seeing that the Bosch opened fire from
the said house seven minutes later his fate was obvious
It was also obvious what our fate would be if we continued in those
marked billets so we moved out bag and baggage into a sunken road
near by and spent the night there in the rain and muck and were most
uncomfortable What puzzled us rather was that the Hun did not shell
our old billets that nightthat is nothing out of the ordinary But
thats only his cunning we consoled ourselves he knows we know he
knows and hes trying to lure us back Ah no old friend
So we camped miserably on in that sunken sewer He dropped a lucky
one through a barn the same afternoon and lobbed a few wides over
during the next night but again nothing out of the ordinary
