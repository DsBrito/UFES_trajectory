CHAPTER I
ON BOARD THE CORMORANT SLOOP
Midway in that period of Irelands history during which according to
historians the distressful country had noneto be more precise on a
spring morning early in the eighteenth century and the reign of George
the First a sloop of about seventy tons burthen was beating up Dingle
Bay in the teeth of a stiff easterly breeze The sun was two hours
high and the grey expanse of the bay was flecked with white horses
hurrying seaward in haste to leap upon the Blasquets or to disport
themselves in the field of ocean From the heaving deck of the vessel
the mountains that shall not be removed were visibleon the northerly
tack Brandon on the southerly Carntual the former sunlit with
patches of moss gleaming like emeralds on its breast the latter dark
and melancholy clothed in the midst of tradition and fancy that in
those days garbed so much of Irelands bog and hill
The sloop had missed the tide and close hauled to the wind rode deep
in the ebb making little way with each tack The breeze hummed through
the rigging The man at the helm humped a shoulder to the sting of the
spray and the rest of the crew seven or eight in numbertarry
pigtailed outlandish sailor mencrouched under the windward rail The
skipper sat with a companion on a coil of rope on the dry side of the
skylight and at the moment at which our story opens was oblivious
alike of the weather and his difficulties He sat with his eyes fixed
on his neighbour and in those eyes a wondering fatuous admiration So
might a mortal look if some strange hap brought him face to face with a
centaur
Never he murmured respectfully
Never his companion answered
My faith Captain Augustin rejoined He was a cross between a
Frenchman and an Irishman For twenty years he had carried wine to
Ireland and returned laden with wool to Bordeaux or Cadiz He knew
every inlet between Achill Sound and the Head of Kinsale and was so
far a Jacobite that he scorned to pay duty to King George Never My
faith he repeated staring if possible harder than ever
No said the Colonel Under no provocation thank God
But its drole Captain Augustin rejoined It would bother me
sorely to know what you do
What we all should do his passenger answered gently Our duty
Captain Augustin Our duty Doing which we are men indeed Doing which
we have no more to do no more to fear no more to question And
Colonel John Sullivan threw out both his hands as if to illustrate the
freedom from care which followed See it is done
But west of Shannon where there is no law Augustin answered Eh
Colonel And in Kerry where well be the saints helping before
noonwhich is all one with Connaught No in Kerry what with
Sullivans and Mahonies and OBeirnes that wear coats only for a
gentleman to tread upon and would sooner shoot a friend before
breakfast than spend the day idle par ma foi Im not seeing what
youll be doing there Colonel
A man may protect himself from violence the Colonel answered
soberly and yet do his duty What he may not dois this He may not
go out to kill another in cold blood for a point of honour or for
revenge or to sustain what he has already done amiss No nor for
vanity or for the hundred trifles for which men risk their lives and
seek the lives of others I hope I make myself clear Captain
Augustin he added courteously
He asked because the skippers face of wonderment was not to be
misread And the skipper answered Quite clear meaning the reverse
Clear indeed Yonder were the hills and bogs of Kerrylawless
impenetrable abominablea realm of Tories and rapparees On the sloop
itself was scarce a man whose hands were free from blood He Augustin
mildmannered as any smuggler on the coast had spent his life between
fleeing and fighting with his four carronades ever crammed to the
muzzle and his cargo ready to be jettisoned at sight of a cruiser And
this man talked as if he were in church Talkedtalkedthe skipper
fairly gasped Oh quite clear he mumbled Quite clear he
replied But its an odd creed
Not a creed my friend Colonel Sullivan replied precisely But the
result of a creed The result thank God of more creeds than one
Captain Augustin cast a wild eye at the straining shrieking rigging
the sloop was lurching heavily But whether he would or no his eye
fluttered back and rested fascinated on the Colonels face Indeed
from the hour ten days earlier which had seen him mount the side in
the Bordeaux river Colonel John Sullivan had been a subject of growing
astonishment to the skipper Captain Augustin knew his world tolerably
In his time he had conveyed many a strange passenger from strand to
strand haggard men who ground their shoulders against the bulkhead
and saw things in corners dark downlooking adventurers whose hands
flew to hilts if a gentleman addressed them suddenly gay young sparks
bound on foreign service and with the point of honour on their lips or
their like returning old and broken to beg or cut throats on the
highwaythese and men who carried their lives in their hands and men
who went cloaked on mysterious missions and men who wept as the
Irish coast faded behind them and men more numerous who wept when
they saw it againhe knew them all All he had carried them talked
with them learned their secrets and more often their hopes
But such a man as this he had never carried A man who indeed wore
outlandish furtrimmed clothes and had seen if his servants sparse
words went for aught outlandish service but who neither swore nor
drank above measure nor swaggered nor threatened Who would not dice
nor gamesave for trifles Who on the contrary talked of duty and
had a peaceful word for all and openly condemned the duello and was
mild as milk and as gentle as an owl Such a one seemed indeed the
fabled phaynix or a bat with six wings or any other prodigy which
the fancy Irish or foreign could conceive
Then to double the marvel the Colonel had a servant a closetongued
fellow William Bale by name and reputed an Englishman who if he was
not like his master was as unlike other folk He was as quietspoken
as the Colonel and as precise and as peaceable He had even been
heard to talk of his duty But while the Colonel was tall and spare
with a gentle eye and a long kindly face and was altogether of a
pensive cast Bale was short and stout of a black pallor and very
forbidding His mouth when he opened itwhich was seldomdropped
honey But his brow scowled his lip sneered and his silence invited
no confidence
Such being the skippers passenger and such his man the wonder was
that Captain Augustins astonishment had not long ago melted into
contempt But it had not For one thing a seaman had been hurt and
the Colonel had exhibited a skill in the treatment of wounds which
would not have disgraced an experienced chirurgeon Then in the Bay the
sloop had met with half a gale and the passenger in circumstances
which the skipper knew to be more trying to landsmen than to himself
had maintained a serenity beyond applause He had even clinging to the
same ringbolt with the skipper while the southwester tore overhead
and the gallant little vessel lay over wellnigh to her beamends
praised with a queer condescension the conduct of the crew
This is the finest thing in the world he had shouted amid the roar
of things to see men doing their duty I would not have missed this
for a hundred crowns
Id give as much to be safe in Cherbourg had been the skippers grim
reply as he watched his mast
But Augustin had not forgotten the Colonels coolness A landsman for
whom the trough of the wave had no terrors and the leeward breakers
falling mountain high on Ushant no message was not a man to be
despised
Indeed from that time the skipper had begun to find a charm in the
Colonels gentleness and courtesy He had fought against the feeling
but it had grown upon him Something that was almost affection began to
mingle with and augment his wonder Hence the patience with which with
Kerry on the beam he listened while the Colonel sang his siren song
He will be one of the people called Quakers the skipper thought
after a while Ive heard of them but never seen one Yes he will be
a Quaker
Unfortunately as he arrived at this conclusion a cry from the
steersman roused him He sprang to his feet Alas the sloop had run
too far on the northerly tack and simultaneously the wind had shifted
a point to the southward In the open water this had advantaged her
but she had been allowed to run into a bight of the north shore and a
line of foam cut her off to the eastward leaving small room to tack
She might still clear the westerly rocks and run out to sea but the
skipper sawwith an oaththat this was doubtful and with a seamans
quickness he made up his mind
Keep her onkeep her on he roared you son of a maudite mere
Child of the accursed We must run into Skull haven And if the men of
Skull take so much as an iron bolt from us and I misdoubt them Ill
keelhaul you son of the Diable Ill not leave an inch of skin upon
you
The man cowering over the wheel obeyed and the little vessel ran up
the narrowing waterin which she had become involvedon an even keel
The crew were already on their feet they had loosened the sheet and
squared the boom they stood by to lower the yard Allthe skipper
with a grim facestood looking forward as the inlet narrowed the
green banks closed in the rocks that fringed them approached Silently
and gracefully the sloop glided on more smoothly with every moment
until a turn in the passage opened a small landlocked haven At the
head of the haven barely a hundred yards above highwater mark stood
a ruined towerthe Tower of Skulland below this a long house of
stone with a thatched roof
It was clear that the sloops movements had been watched from the
shore for although the melancholy waste of moor and mountain disclosed
no other habitation a score of halfnaked barefoot figures were
gathered on the jetty while others could be seen hurrying down the
hillside These cried to one another in an unknown tongue and with
shrill eldritch voices which vied with the screams of the gulls
swinging overhead
Stand by to let go the kedge Augustin cried eyeing them gloomily
We are too far in now Let golet go
But the order and the ensuing action at once redoubled the clamour on
shore A dozen of the foremost natives flung themselves into crazy
boats that seemed as if they could not float long enough to reach the
vessel But the men handled them with consummate skill and with equal
daring In a twinkling they were within hail and a man wearing a long
frieze coat a fishermans red cap and little besides stood up in the
bow of the nearest
You will be coming to the jetty Captain he cried in imperfect
English
The skipper scowled at him but did not answer
You will come to the jetty Captain the man repeated in his high
singsong voice Sure and youve come convenient for theres no one
here barring yourselves
And youre wanting brandy Augustin muttered bitterly under his
breath He glanced at his men as if he meditated resistance
But Kerry law Kerry law the man cried You know it well Captain
Its not Ill be answerable if you dont come to the jetty
The skipper who had fallen ill at Skull once before and got away with
some loss hoping that he might never see the place again knew that he
was in the mens power True a single discharge of his carronades
would blow the boats to pieces but he could not in a moment warp his
ship out through the narrow passage And if he could he knew that the
act would be bloodily avenged if he ever landed again in that part of
Ireland He swore under his breath and the steersman who had wrought
the harm by holding on too long wilted under his eye The crew looked
other ways
At length he yielded and sulkily gave the order the windlass was
manned and the kedge drawn up Fenders were lowered and the sloop
slid gently to the jetty side
In a twinkling a score of natives swarmed aboard The man in the frieze
coat followed more leisurely and with such dignity as became the owner
of a stonewalled house He sauntered up to the skipper a leer in his
eye You will have lost something the last time you were here
Captain he said It is not I that will be responsible this time
unless the stuff is landed
Augustin laughed scornfully The cargo is for Crosby of Castlemaine
he said And he added various things which he hoped would happen to
himself if he landed so much as a single tub
Its little we know of Crosby here the other replied and he spat on
the deck And less well be caring my dear I say it shall be landed
Here you Darby Sullivan off with the hatch
Augustin stepped forward impulsively as if he had a mind to throw the
gentleman in the frieze coat into the sea But he had not armed himself
before he came on deck the men of Skull outnumbered his crew two to
one and savage and halfnaked as they were were furnished to a man
with long sharp skenes and the skill to use them If resistance had
been possible at any time he had let the moment pass The nearest
Justice lived twelve Irish miles away and had he been on the spot he
would since he was of necessity a Protestant have been as
helplessunless he brought the garrison of Tralee at his backas a
churchwarden in a Synod of Cardinals The skipper hesitated and while
he hesitated the hatches were off and the Sullivans swarmed down like
monkeys Before the sloop could be made fast the smaller kegs were
being tossed up and passed over the side a line was formed on land
and the cargo which had last seen the sun on the banks of the Garonne
was swiftly vanishing in the maw of the stone house on the shore
The skippers rage was great but he could only swear and OSullivan
Og the man in the frieze coat who bore him an old grudge grinned in
mockery For better custody Captain he said For better custody
Under my roof bien And when you will to go again there will be the
dues to be paid the little dues over which we quarrelled last time
And all will be rendered to a stave
You villain the Captain muttered under his breath I understand
Turningfor the sight was more than he could bearhe found his
passenger at his elbow
The Colonel if his face went for anything liked the proceedings
almost as little as the skipper His lips were tightly closed and he
frowned
Ay Augustin cried bitterlyfor the first instinct of the man who is
hurt is to hurt anothernow you see what it is youve come back to
Its rob or be robbed this side of Tralee and as far as the devil
could kick you beyond it I wish you well out of it But I suppose it
would take more than this to make you draw that long hanger of yours
The Colonel cast a troubled eye on him Beyond doubt he said it is
the duty of a man to assist in defending the house of his host And in
a sense and measure the goods of his hostwith an uneasy look at the
fastvanishing cargo which was leaping from hand to hand so swiftly
that the progress of a tub from the hold to the house was as the flight
of a swalloware the house of his host I do not deny that he
continued precisely but
But in this instance the seacaptain struck in with a sneer
contempt for the first time mastering wonder in this instance
In this instance the Colonel repeated with an unmistakable blush I
am not very free to act The truth is Captain Augustin these folk are
of my kin I was born not many miles from herehis eye measured the
lonely landscape as if he compared it with more recent scenesand
wrong or right blood is thicker than wine So that frankly I am not
clear that for the sake of your Bordeaux Im tied to shed blood that
might be my forbears
Or your grandmothers Augustin cried with an open sneer
Or my grandmothers Very true But if a word to them in season
Oh dn your words the skipper retorted disdainfully
He would have said more but at that moment it became clear that
something was happening on shore On the green brow beside the tower a
girl mounted on horseback had appeared at a cry from her the men had
stopped work The next moment her horse came cantering down the slope
and with uplifted whip she rode in among the men The whip fell twice
and down went all the tubs within reach Her voice speaking now Erse
now Kerry English could be heard upbraiding the nearest commanding
threatening denouncing Then on the brow behind her appeared in turn a
mana man who looked gigantic against the sky and who sat a horse to
match He descended more slowly and reached the girls side as
OSullivan Og in his frieze coat came to the front in support of his
men
For a full minute the girl vented her anger on Og while he stood sulky
but patient waiting for an opening to defend himself When he obtained
this he seemed to the two on the deck of the sloop to appeal to the
big man who said a word or two but was cut short by the girl Her
voice passionate and indignant reached the deck but not her words
That should be Flavia McMurrough the Colonel murmured thoughtfully
And Uncle Ulick Hes little changed whoevers changed She has a
will it seems and good impulses
The big man had begun by frowning on OSullivan Og But presently he
smiled at something the latter said then he laughed at last he made a
joke himself At that the girl turned on him but he argued with her A
man held up a tub for inspection and though she struck it pettishly
with her whip it was plain that she was shaken OSullivan Og pointed
to the sloop pointed to his house grinned The listeners on the deck
caught the word Dues and the peal of laughter that followed
Captain Augustin understood naught of what was going forward But the
man beside him who did touched his sleeve It were well to speak to
her he said
Who is she the skipper asked impatiently What has she to do with
it
They are her people the Colonel answered simplyor they should be
If she says yea it is yea and if she says nay it is nay Or so it
should beas far as a league beyond Morristown
Augustin waited for no more He was still in a fog but he saw a ray of
hope this was the Chatelaine it seemed He bundled over the side
Alas he ventured too late As his feet touched the slippery stones of
the jetty the girl wheeled her horse about with an angry exclamation
shook her whip at OSullivan Ogwho winked the moment her back was
turnedand cantered away up the hill On the instant the men picked up
the kegs they had dropped a shrill cry passed down the line and the
work was resumed
But the big man remained and the skipper with the Colonel at his
elbow made for him through the halfnaked kernes He saw them coming
however guessed their errand and with the plain intention of
avoiding them he turned his horses head
But the skipper springing forward was in time to seize his stirrup
Sir he cried this is robbery Nom de Dieu it is thievery
The big man looked down at him with temper Oh by Gd you must pay
your dues he said Oh yes you must pay your dues
But this is robbery
Sure its not that you must be saying
The Colonel put the skipper on one side By your leave he cried
one word You dont know sir who I am but
I know you must pay your dues Uncle Ulick answered parrotlike Oh
yes you must pay your dues He was clearly ashamed of his role
however for as he spoke he shook off the Colonels hold with a pettish
gesture struck his horse with his stick and cantered away over the
hill In a twinkling he was lost to sight
Vaurien cried Captain Augustin shaking his fist after him But he
might as well have sworn at the moon
CHAPTER II
MORRISTOWN
It was not until the Colonel had passed over the shoulder above the
stonewalled house that he escaped from the jabber of the crowd and the
jeers of the younger members of this savage tribe who noting
something abnormal in the fashion of the strangers clothes followed
him a space On descending the farther slope however he found himself
alone in the silence of the waste Choosing without hesitation one of
two tracks illtrodden but such as in that district and at that
period passed for roads he took his way along it at a good pace
A wide brown basin bog for the most part but rising here and there
into low mounds of sward or clumps of thorntrees stretched away to
the foot of the hills He gazed upon it with eyes which had been
strained for years across the vast unbroken plains of Central Europe
the sandy steppes of Poland the frozen marshes of Lithuania and
beside the majesty of their boundless distances this view shrank to
littleness But it spoke to more than his eyes it spoke to the heart
to feelings and memories which time had not blunted nor could blunt
The tower on the shoulder behind him had been raised by his wild
forefathers in the days when the Spaniard lay at Smerwick and mean
and crumbling still gave rise to emotions which the stern battlements
of Stralsund or of Rostock had failed to evoke Soil and sky the lark
which sang overhead the dark peatwater which rose under foot the
scent of the moist air the cry of the curlew all spoke of homethe
home which he had left in the gaiety of youth to return to it a grave
man older than his years and with grey hairs flecking the black No
wonder that he stood more than once and absorbed in thought gazed on
this or that on crag and moss on the things which time and experience
had so strangely diminished
The track after zigzagging across a segment of the basin that has
been described entered a narrow valley drained by a tolerable stream
After ascending this for a couple of miles it disclosed a view of a
wider vale enclosed by gentle hills of no great height In the lap of
this nestled a lake on the upper end of which some beauty was
conferred by a few masses of rock partly clothed by birchtrees
through which a stream fell sharply from the upland Not far from these
rocks a long low house stood on the shore
The stranger paused to take in the prospect nor was it until after the
lapse of some minutes spent in the deepest reverie that he pursued
his way along the lefthand bank of the lake Byandby he was able to
discern amid the masses of rock at the head of the lake a grey tower
the twin of that Tower of Skull which he had left behind him and a
hundred paces farther he came upon a near view of the house
Twoandtwenty years he murmured There is not even a dog to bid me
welcome
The house was of two stories with a thatched roof Its back was to the
slopes that rose by marshy terraces to the hills Its face was turned
to the lake and between it and the water lay a walled forecourt the
angle on each side of the entrance protected by a tower of an older
date than the house The entrance was somewhat pretentious and
mightfor each of the pillars supported a heraldic beasthave seemed
to an English eye out of character with the thatched roof But as if
to correct this one of the beasts was headless and one of the gates
had fallen from its hinges In like manner the dignity of a tolerably
spacious garden laid out beside the house was marred by the proximity
of the foldyard which had also trespassed in the shape of sundry
offices and hovels on the forecourt
On the lower side of the road opposite the gates half a dozen stone
steps that like the heraldic pillars might have graced a more stately
mansion led down to the water They formed a restingplace for as many
beggars engaged in drawing at empty pipes while twice as many old
women sat against the wall of the forecourt and with their drugget
cloaks about them kept up a continual whine Among these turning
herself now to one now to another moved the girl whom the Colonel had
seen at the landingplace She held her ridingskirt uplifted in one
hand her whip in the other and she was bareheaded At her elbow
whistling idly and tapping his boots with a switch lounged the big
man of the morning
As the Colonel approached taking these things in with his eyes and
making Heaven knows what comparisons in his mind the man and the maid
turned and looked at him The two exchanged some sentences and the man
came forward to meet him
Sir he said not without a touch of rough courtesy if it is for
hospitality you have come you will be welcome at Morristown But if it
is to start a cry about this mornings business youve travelled on
your ten toes to no purpose and so I warn you
The Colonel looked at him Cousin Ulick he said I take your
welcome as it is meant and I thank you for it
The big mans mouth opened wide By the Holy Cross he said if Im
not thinking it is John Sullivan
It is the Colonel answered smiling And he held out his hand
Uncle Ulick grasped it impulsively And its Im the one thats glad
to see you he said By Heaven I am Though I didnt expect you no
more than I expected myself And faith he continued grinning as if
he began to see something humorous as well as surprising in the
arrival Im not sure that you will be as welcome to all John
Sullivan as you are to me
You were always easy Ulick the other answered with a smile when
you were big and I was little
Ay Well in size were much as we were ButFlavia
The girl scenting something strange was already at his elbow What
is it she asked her breath coming a little quickly Who is it
fixing her eyes on the newcomers face
Uncle Ulick chuckled Its your guardian my jewel he said No
less And what hell say to whats going on Ill not be foretelling
My guardian she repeated the blood rising abruptly to her cheek
Just that Ulick Sullivan answered humorously Just that my
darling Its John Sullivan come back from Sweden And as Ive told
him Im not sure that all at Morristown will be as glad to see him as
I am At which Uncle Ulick went off into a peal of Titanic laughter
But that which amused him did not appear to amuse his niece She stood
staring at Colonel Sullivan as if she were far more surprised than
pleased At length and with a childish dignity she held out her hand
If you are Colonel John Sullivan she said in a thin voice you are
welcome at Morristown
He might have laughed at the distance of her tone But he merely bowed
and with the utmost gravity I thank you he answered And then
addressing Ulick Sullivan I need not say that I had your
communication he continued with the news of Sir Michaels death and
of the dispositions made by his will I could not come at once but
when I could I did and I am here Having said so much he went on
turning to the girl and looking at her with serious kindness may I
add that I think it will be well if we leave matters of business on one
side until we know one another
Well faith I think wed better Ulick Sullivan replied And he
chuckled I do think so bedad
The girl said nothing and when he had chuckled his fill restraint fell
upon the three They turned from one another and looked across the
lake which the wind brisk at sea barely ruffled Colonel Sullivan
remarked that they had a little more land under tillage than he
remembered and Ulick Sullivan assented And then again there was
silence until the girl struck her habit with her whip and cried
flippantly Well to dinner if we are to have dinner To dinner She
turned and led the way to the gate of the forecourt
The man who followed was clever enough to read defiance in the pose of
her head and resentment in her shoulders When a beggarwoman more
importunate than the rest caught hold of her skirt and Flavia flicked
her with the whip as she would have flicked a dog he understood And
when the dogs in the court fell upon her in a troop and were kicked to
right and left and when a babe that clothed in a single shift was
crawling on hands and knees upon the threshold was removed in the same
mannerbut more gentlystill he understood
There were other dogs in the stonepaved hall a hen too finding its
food on the floor and strutting here and there as if it had never known
another home On the left of the door an oak table stood laid for the
midday meal on the right before a carved stone chimneypiece under
which a huge log smouldered on the andirons two or three men were
seated These rose on the entrance of the young mistressthey were
dependants of the better class for whom open house was kept at
Morristown when business brought them thither And so far all was
well Yet it may be that on the instant eyes which had been blind to
defects were opened by the presence of this stranger from the outer
world For Flavias voice was hard as she asked old Darby the butler
if The McMurrough was in the house
Faith I believe not said he His honour nor the other quality
