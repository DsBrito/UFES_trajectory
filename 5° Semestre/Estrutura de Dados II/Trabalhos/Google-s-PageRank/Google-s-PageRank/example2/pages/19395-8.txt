CHAPTER I
THE NEW HEAVENS
Go out under the open sky on a clear and moonless night and try
to count the stars If your station lies well beyond the glare of
cities which is often strong enough to conceal all but the brighter
objects you will find the task a difficult one Ranging through
the six magnitudes of the Greek astronomers from the brilliant
Sirius to the faintest perceptible points of light the stars are
scattered in great profusion over the celestial vault Their number
seems limitless yet actual count will show that the eye has been
deceived In a survey of the entire heavens from pole to pole
it would not be possible to detect more than from six to seven
thousand stars with the naked eye From a single viewpoint even
with the keenest vision only two or three thousand can be seen
So many of these are at the limit of visibility that Ptolemys
Almagest a catalogue of all the stars whose places were measured
with the simple instruments of the Greek astronomers contains
only 1022 stars
Back of Ptolemy through the speculations of the Greek philosophers
the mysteries of the Egyptian sungod and the observations of the
ancient Chaldeans the rich and varied traditions of astronomy stretch
far away into a shadowy past All peoples in the first stirrings
of their intellectual youth drawn by the nightly splendor of the
skies and the ceaseless motions of the planets have set up some
system of the heavens in which the sense of wonder and the desire
for knowledge were no less concerned than the practical necessities
of life The measurement of time and the needs of navigation have
always stimulated astronomical research but the intellectual demand
has been keen from the first Hipparchus and the Greek astronomers
of the Alexandrian school shaking off the vagaries of magic and
divination placed astronomy on a scientific basis though the
reaction of the Middle Ages caused even such a great astronomer
as Tycho Brahe himself to revert for a time to the practice of
astrology
EARLY INSTRUMENTS
The transparent sky of Egypt rarely obscured by clouds greatly
favored Ptolemys observations Here was prepared his great star
catalogue based upon the earlier observations of Hipparchus and
destined to remain alone in its field for more than twelve centuries
until Ulugh Bey Prince of Samarcand repeated the work of his
Greek predecessor Throughout this period the stars were looked
upon mainly as points of reference for the observation of planetary
motions and the instruments of observation underwent little change
The astrolabe which consists of a circle divided into degrees
with a rotating diametral arm for sighting purposes embodies their
essential principle In its simple form the astrolabe was suspended
in a vertical plane and the stars were observed by bringing the
sights on the movable diameter to bear upon them Their altitude
was then read off on the circle Ultimately the circle of the
astrolabe mounted with one of its diameters parallel to the earths
axis became the armillary sphere the precursor of our modern
equatorial telescope Great stone quadrants fixed in the meridian
were also employed from very early times Out of such furnishings
little modified by the lapse of centuries was provided the elaborate
instrumental equipment of Uranibourg the great observatory built
by Tycho Brahe on the Danish island of Huen in 1576 In this City
of the Heavens still dependent solely upon the unaided eye as a
collector of starlight Tycho made those invaluable observations
that enabled Kepler to deduce the true laws of planetary motion But
after all these centuries the sidereal world embraced no objects
barring an occasional comet or temporary star that lay beyond
the vision of the earliest astronomers The conceptions of the
stellar universe except those that ignored the solid ground of
observation were limited by the small aperture of the human eye
But the dawn of another age was at hand
Illustration Fig 2 The Great Nebula in Orion Pease
Photographed with the 100inch telescope This shortexposure photograph
shows only the bright central part of the nebula A longer exposure
reveals a vast outlying region
The dominance of the sun as the central body of the solar system
recognized by Aristarchus of Samos nearly three centuries before
the Christian era but subsequently denied under the authority of
Ptolemy and the teachings of the Church was reaffirmed by the
Polish monk Copernicus in 1543 Keplers laws of the motions of the
planets showing them to revolve in ellipses instead of circles
removed the last defect of the Copernican system and left no room for
its rejection But both the world and the Church clung to tradition
and some visible demonstration was urgently needed This was supplied
by Galileo through his invention of the telescope
Illustration Fig 3 Model by Ellerman of summit of Mount Wilson
showing the observatory buildings among the trees and bushes
The 60foot tower on the extreme left which is at the edge of
a precipitous canon 1500 feet deep is the vertical telescope
of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Above it are the
Monastery and other buildings used as quarters by the astronomers
of the Mount Wilson Observatory while at work on the mountain The
offices computingrooms laboratories and shops are in Pasadena
Following the ridge we come successively to the dome of the 10inch
photographic telescope the powerhouse laboratory Snow horizontal
telescope 60foottower telescope and 150foottower telescope
these last three used for the study of the sun The dome of the
60inch reflecting telescope is just below the 150foot tower
while that of the 100inch telescope is farther to the right The
altitude of Mount Wilson is about 5900 feet
The crystalline lens of the human eye limited by the iris to a
maximum opening about onequarter of an inch in diameter was the
only collector of starlight available to the Greek and Arabian
astronomers Galileos telescope which in 1610 suddenly pushed
out the boundaries of the known stellar universe and brought many
thousands of stars into range had a lens about 214 inches in
diameter The area of this lens proportional to the square of
its diameter was about eightyone times that of the pupil of the
eye This great increase in the amount of light collected should
bring to view stars down to magnitude 105 of which nearly half
a million are known to exist
It is not too much to say that Galileos telescope revolutionized
human thought Turned to the moon it revealed mountains plains
and valleys while the sun previously supposed immaculate in its
perfection was seen to be blemished with dark spots changing from
day to day Jupiter shown to be accompanied by four encircling
satellites afforded a picture in miniature of the solar system
and strongly supported the Copernican view of its organization
which was conclusively demonstrated by Galileos discovery of the
changing phases of Venus and the variation of its apparent diameter
during its revolution about the sun Galileos proof of the Copernican
theory marked the downfall of medivalism and established astronomy on
a firm foundation But while his telescope multiplied a hundredfold
the number of visible stars more than a century elapsed before
the true possibilities of sidereal astronomy were perceived
Illustration Fig 4 The 100inch Hooker telescope
STRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSE
Sir William Herschel was the first astronomer to make a serious
attack upon the problem of the structure of the stellar universe
In his first memoir on the Construction of the Heavens read
before the Royal Society in 1784 he wrote as follows
Hitherto the sidereal heavens have not inadequately for the purpose
designed been represented by the concave surface of a sphere in
the centre of which the eye of an observer might be supposed to be
placed In future we shall look upon those regions into which we
may now penetrate by means of such large telescopes as a naturalist
regards a rich extent of ground or chain of mountains containing
strata variously inclined and directed as well as consisting of
very different materials
On turning his 18inch reflecting telescope to a part of the Milky
Way in Orion he found its whitish appearance to be completely
resolved into small stars not separately seen with his former
telescopes The glorious multitude of stars of all possible sizes
that presented themselves here to my view are truly astonishing but
as the dazzling brightness of glittering stars may easily mislead
us so far as to estimate their number greater than it really is
I endeavored to ascertain this point by counting many fields and
computing from a mean of them what a certain given portion of
the Milky Way might contain By this means applied not only to
the Milky Way but to all parts of the heavens Herschel determined
the approximate number and distribution of all the stars within
reach of his instrument
By comparing many hundred gauges or counts of stars visible in
a field of about onequarter of the area of the moon Herschel
found that the average number of stars increased toward the great
circle which most nearly conforms with the course of the Milky Way
Ninety degrees from this plane at the pole of the Milky Way only
four stars on the average were seen in the field of the telescope
In approaching the Milky Way this number increased slowly at first
and then more and more rapidly until it rose to an average of
122 stars per field
Illustration Fig 5 Erecting the polar axis of the 100inch
telescope
These observations were made in the northern hemisphere and
subsequently Sir John Herschel using his fathers telescope at
the Cape of Good Hope found an almost exactly similar increase
of apparent star density for the southern hemisphere According to
his estimates the total number of stars in both hemispheres that
could be seen distinctly enough to be counted in this telescope
would probably be about five and onehalf millions
The Herschels concluded that the stars of our firmament instead
of being scattered in all directions indifferently through space
form a stratum of which the thickness is small in comparison with
its length and breadth and in which the earth occupies a place
somewhere about the middle of its thickness between the point
where it subdivides into two principal lamin inclined at a small
angle to each other This view does not differ essentially from our
modern conception of the form of the Galaxy but as the Herschels
were unable to see stars fainter than the fifteenth magnitude
it is evident that their conclusions apply only to a restricted
region surrounding the solar system in the midst of the enormously
extended sidereal universe which modern instruments have brought
within our range
MODERN METHODS
The remarkable progress of modern astronomy is mainly due to two
great instrumental advances the rise and development of the
photographic telescope and the application of the spectroscope to
the study of celestial objects These new and powerful instruments
supplemented by many accessories which have completely revolutionized
observatory equipment have not only revealed a vastly greater
number of stars and nebul they have also rendered feasible
observations of a type formerly regarded as impossible The chemical
analysis of a faint star is now so easy that it can be accomplished
in a very short timeas quickly in fact as an equally complex
substance can be analyzed in the laboratory The spectroscope also
measures a stars velocity the pressure at different levels in
its atmosphere its approximate temperature and now by a new
and ingenious method its distance from the earth It determines
the velocity of rotation of the sun and of nebul the existence
and periods of orbital revolution of binary stars too close to
be separated by any telescope the presence of magnetic fields
in sunspots and the fact that the entire sun like the earth is
a magnet
Illustration Fig 6 Lowest section of tube of 100inch telescope
ready to leave Pasadena for Mount Wilson
Such new possibilities with many others resulting from the application
of physical methods of the most diverse character have greatly
enlarged the astronomers outlook He may now attack two great
problems 1 The structure of the universe and the motions of
its constituent bodies and 2 the evolution of the stars their
nature origin growth and decline These two problems are intimately
related and must be studied as one
Footnote  A third great problem open to the astronomer the
study of the constitution of matter is described in Chapter III
If space permitted it would be interesting to survey the progress
already accomplished by modern methods of astronomical research
Hundreds of millions of stars have been photographed and the boundaries
of the stellar universe have been pushed far into space but have not
been attained Globular star clusters containing tens of thousands
of stars are on so great a scale according to Shapley that light
travelling at the rate of 186000 miles per second may take 500
years to cross one of them while the most distant of these objects
may be more than 200000 lightyears from the earth The spiral
nebul more than a million in number are vast whirling masses
in process of development but we are not yet certain whether they
should be regarded as island universes or as subordinate to the
stellar system which includes our minute group of sun and planets
the great star clouds of the Milky Way and the distant globular
star clusters
Illustration Fig 7 Section of a steel girder for dome covering
the 100inch telescope on its way up Mount Wilson
These few particulars may give a slight conception of the scale
of the known universe but a word must be added regarding some
of its most striking phenomena The great majority of the stars
whose motions have been determined belong to one or the other of
two great star streams but the part played by these streams in the
sidereal system as a whole is still obscure The stars have been
grouped in classes presumably in the order of their evolutional
development as they pass from the early state of gaseous masses of
low density through the successive stages resulting from loss of
heat by radiation and increased density due to shrinkage Strangely
enough their velocities in space show a corresponding change
increasing as they grow older or perhaps depending upon their mass
It is impossible within these limits to do more than to give some
indication of the scope of the new astronomy Enough has been said
however to assist in appreciating the increased opportunity for
investigation and the nature of the heavy demands made upon the
modern observatory But before passing on to describe one of the
latest additions to the astronomers instrumental equipment a
word should be added regarding the chief classes of telescopes
REFRACTORS AND REFLECTORS
Astronomical telescopes are of two types refractors and reflectors
A refracting telescope consists of an objectglass composed of
two or more lenses mounted at the upper end of a tube which is
pointed at the celestial object The light after passing through
the lenses is brought to a focus at the lower end of the tube where
the image is examined visually with an eyepiece or photographed
upon a sensitive plate The largest instruments of this type are
the 36inch Lick telescope and the 40inch refractor of the Yerkes
Observatory
Illustration Fig 8 Erecting the steel building and revolving
dome that cover the Hooker telescope
Reflecting telescopes which are particularly adapted for photographic
work though also excellent for visual observations are very
differently constructed No lens is used The telescope tube is
usually built in skeleton form open at its upper end and with
a large concave mirror supported at its base This mirror serves
in place of a lens Its upper surface is paraboloidal in shape
as a spherical surface will not unite in a sharp focus the rays
coming from a distant object The light passes through no glassa
great advantage especially for photography as the absorption
in lenses cuts out much of the blue and violet light to which
photographic plates are most sensitive The reflection occurs on
the upper surface of the mirror which is covered with a coat of
pure silver renewed several times a year and always kept highly
burnished Silvered glass is better than metals or other substances
for telescope mirrors chiefly because of the perfection with which
glass can be ground and polished and the ease of renewing its
silvered surface when tarnished
The great reflectors of Herschel and Lord Rosse which were provided
with mirrors of speculum metal were far inferior to much smaller
telescopes of the present day With these instruments the star images
were watched as they were carried through the field of view by the
earths rotation or kept roughly in place by moving the telescope
with ropes or chains Photographic plates which reveal invisible
stars and nebul when exposed for hours in modern instruments were
not then available In any case they could not have been used
in the absence of the perfect mechanism required to keep the star
images accurately fixed in place upon the sensitive film
Illustration Fig 9 Building and revolving dome 100 feet in
diameter covering the 100inch Hooker telescope
Photographed from the summit of the 150foottower telescope
It would be interesting to trace the long contest for supremacy
between refracting and reflecting telescopes each of which at
certain stages in its development appeared to be unrivalled In
modern observatories both types are used each for the purpose for
which it is best adapted For the photography of nebul and the
study of the fainter stars the reflector has special advantages
illustrated by the work of such instruments as the Crossley and Mills
reflectors of the Lick Observatory the great 72inch reflector
recently brought into effective service at the Dominion Observatory
in Canada and the 60inch and 100inch reflectors of the Mount
Wilson Observatory
The unaided eye with an available area of onetwentieth of a square
inch permits us to see stars of the sixth magnitude Herschels
18inch reflector with an area 5000 times as great rendered
visible stars of the fifteenth magnitude The 60inch reflector
with an area 57600 times that of the eye reveals stars of the
eighteenth magnitude while to reach stars of about the twentieth
magnitude photographic exposures of four or five hours suffice
with this instrument
Every gain of a magnitude means a great gain in the number of stars
rendered visible Stars of the second magnitude are 34 times as
numerous as those of the first those of the eighth magnitude are
three times as numerous as those of the seventh while the sixteenth
magnitude stars are only 17 as numerous as those of the fifteenth
magnitude This steadily decreasing ratio is probably due to an
actual thinning out of the stars toward the boundaries of the stellar
universe as the most exhaustive tests have failed to give any
evidence of absorption of light in its passage through space But
in spite of this decrease the gain of a single additional magnitude
may mean the addition of many millions of stars to the total of those
already shown by the 60inch reflector Here is one of the chief
sources of interest in the possibilities of a 100inch reflecting
telescope
100INCH TELESCOPE
Illustration Fig 10 Onehundredinch mirror just silvered
rising out of the silveringroom in pier before attachment to lower
end of telescope tube Seen above
In 1906 the late John D Hooker of Los Angeles gave the Carnegie
Institution of Washington a sum sufficient to construct a telescope
mirror 100 inches in diameter and thus large enough to collect
160000 times the light received by the eye Fig 10 The casting
and annealing of a suitable glass disk 101 inches in diameter
and 13 inches thick weighing four and onehalf tons was a most
difficult operation finally accomplished by a great French glass
company at their factory in the Forest of St Gobain A special
optical laboratory was erected at the Pasadena headquarters of
the Mount Wilson Observatory and here the long task of grinding
figuring and testing the mirror was successfully carried out by
the observatory opticians This operation which is one of great
delicacy required years for its completion Meanwhile the building
dome and mounting for the telescope were designed by members of
the observatory staff and the working drawings were prepared An
opportune addition by Mr Carnegie to the endowment of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington of which the observatory is a branch
permitted the necessary appropriations to be made for the completion
and erection of the telescope Though delayed by the war during
which the mechanical and optical facilities of the observatory
shops were utilized for military and naval purposes the telescope
is now in regular use on Mount Wilson
The instrument is mounted on a massive pier of reinforced concrete
33 feet high and 52 feet in diameter at the top A solid wall extends
south from this pier a distance of 50 feet on the west side of
which a very powerful spectrograph for photographing the spectra
of the brightest stars will be mounted Within the pier are a
photographic dark room a room for silvering the large mirror which
can be lowered into the pier and the clockroom where stands
the powerful drivingclock with which the telescope is caused
to follow the apparent motion of the stars Fig 11
Illustration Fig 11 The drivingclock and wormgear that cause
the 100inch Hooker telescope to follow the stars
The telescope mounting is of the English type in which the telescope
tube is supported by the declination trunnions between the arms of
the polar axis built in the form of a rectangular yoke carried by
bearings on massive pedestals to the north and south These bearings
must be aligned exactly parallel to the axis of the earth and must
support the polar axis so freely that it can be rotated with perfect
precision by the drivingclock which turns a wormwheel 17 feet in
diameter clamped to the lower end of the axis As this motion
must be sufficiently uniform to counteract exactly the rotation
of the earth on its axis and thus to maintain the star images
accurately in position in the field of view the greatest care
had to be taken in the construction of the drivingclock and in
the spacing and cutting of the teeth in the large wormwheel Here
as in the case of all of the more refined parts of the instrument
the work was done by skilled machinists in the observatory shops in
Pasadena or on Mount Wilson after the assembling of the telescope
The massive sections of the instrument some of which weigh as
much as ten tons each were constructed at Quincy Mass where
machinery sufficiently large to build battleships was available
They were then shipped to California and transported to the summit
of Mount Wilson over a road built for this purpose by the construction
division of the observatory which also built the pier on which the
telescope stands and erected the steel building and dome that
cover it
Illustration Fig 12 Large irregular nebula and star cluster
in Sagittarius Duncan
Photographed with the 60inch telescope
Illustration Fig 13 Faint spiral nebula in the constellation
of the Hunting Dogs Pease
Photographed with the 60inch telescope
The parts of the telescope which are moved by the drivingclock
weigh about 100 tons and it was necessary to provide means of
reducing the great friction on the bearings of the polar axis To
accomplish this large hollow steel cylinders floating in mercury
held in castiron tanks were provided at the upper and lower ends
of the polar axis Almost the entire weight of the instrument is
thus floated in mercury and in this way the friction is so greatly
reduced that the drivingclock moves the instrument with perfect
ease and smoothness
The 100inch mirror rests at the bottom of the telescope tube on
a special support system so designed as to prevent any bending of
the glass under its own weight Electric motors forty in number are
provided to move the telescope rapidly or slowly in right ascension
east or west and in declination north or south for focussing
the mirrors and for many other purposes They are also used for
rotating the dome 100 feet in diameter under which the telescope
is mounted and for opening the shutter 20 feet wide through
which the observations are made
A telescope of this kind can be used in several different ways
The 100inch mirror has a focal length of about 42 feet and in
one of the arrangements of the instrument the photographic plate
is mounted at the centre of the telescope tube near its upper end
where it receives directly the image formed by the large mirror In
another arrangement a silvered glass mirror with plane surface
is supported near the upper end of the tube at an angle of 45 so
as to form the image at the side of the tube where the photographic
plate can be placed In this case the observer stands on a platform
which is moved up and down by electric motors in front of the opening
in the dome through which the observations are made
Illustration Fig 14 Spiral nebula in Andromeda seen edge on
Ritchey
Photographed with the 60inch telescope
Other arrangements of the telescope for which auxiliary convex
mirrors carried near the upper end of the tube are required permit
the image to be photographed at the side of the tube near its lower
end either with or without a spectrograph or with a very powerful
spectrograph mounted within a constanttemperature chamber south
of the telescope pier In this last case the light of a star is
so reflected by auxiliary mirrors that it passes down through a
hole in the south end of the polar axis and brings the star to
