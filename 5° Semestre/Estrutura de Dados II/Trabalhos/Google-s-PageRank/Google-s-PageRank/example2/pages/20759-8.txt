themselves into the slumbers of sportsmen who have not treated them as
they deserved I have suffered from it myself It was only last week
that having said something derogatory to the dignity of my second gun
I woke with a start at two oclock in the morning and found its wraith
going through the most horrible antics in a patch of moonlight on my
bedroom floor I shot with that gun on the following day and missed
nearly everything I shot at Could there be a more convincing proof
Take my advice therefore and abstain from abusing your gun
Now your typical smokingroom conversation ought always to include the
following subjects1 The wrongheaded unpopular man whom every
district possesses and who is always at loggerheads with somebody 2
The best shot in England who is to be found in every countryside
and in whose achievements all the sportsmen of his particular district
take a patriotic pride 3 the folly and wickedness of those who talk
or write ignorantly against any kind of sport 4 the deficiency of
hares due to the rascally provisions of the Hares and Rabbits Act 5 a
few reminiscences slightly glorified of the particular days sport
and 6 a prolonged argument on the relative merits of the old plan of
shooting birds over dogs and the modern methods of walking them up or
driving These are not the only but certainly the chief ingredients
Let me give you an example drawn from my notebook
SCENEThe Smokingroom of a Countryhouse in December Six Sportsmen
in Smokingcoats Time 1115 PM
First Sportsman concluding a harangue All I can say is I never
read such rot in all my life Why the fellow doesnt know a gun from a
cartridgebag Im perfectly sick of reading that everlasting rubbish
about pampered minions of the aristocracy slaughtering the unresisting
pheasant in his thousands at battues I wonder what the beggars imagine
a rocketing pheasant is like I should like to have seen one of em
outside Chivy Wood today I never saw taller birds in my life Talk of
them being easy Why a pheasant gets ever so much more show for his
money when hes beaten over the guns If they simply walk him up he
hasnt got a thousand to one chance Bah
Drinks from a long glass
Second Sportsman I saw in some paper the other day what the President
of the United States thought about English battueshooting Seemed to
think we shot pheasants perched in the trees and went on to say that
wasnt the sport for him he liked to go after his game and find it
for himself Who the deuce cares if he does If he cant talk better
sense than that no wonder CLEVELAND beat him in the election
Third Sp Pure rubbish of course Still I must say apart from
pheasants I like the old plan of letting your dogs work Its far more
sport than walking up partridges in line or getting them driven at you
First Sp My dear fellow I dont agree with you a bit In the first
place as to drivingdriven birds are fifty times more difficult and
whats the use of wasting time with setters or pointers in ordinary
rootfields Its all sentiment
A long and animated discussion ensues This particular
subject never fails to provoke a tremendous argument
A few minutes later
Second Sp to the host What was the bag today CHALMERS
Chalmers A hundred and fortyfive pheasants fiftysix rabbits
eleven hares three pigeons and a woodcock We should have got a
hundred and eighty pheasants if they hadnt dodged us in the big wood I
cant make out where they went
Second Sp Its a deuced difficult wood to beat that is I thought we
should have got more hares all the same
Chalmers Hares I think Im precious lucky to get so many nowadays
There wont be a hare left in a year or two
The discussion proceeds
Third Sp Hows old JOHNNY RAIKES shooting this year I never saw such
a chap for rocketers They cant escape him
Chalmers I asked him today but he couldnt come I think for
pheasants hes quite the best shot in England Nobody can beat him at
that game
Fourth Sp Hasnt he got some row or other on with Crackside
Chalmers Yes That makes fourteen rows Crackside has got going on
all at once He seems to revel in them His latest move was to refuse to
pay tithe and when the parson levied a distress he made all his
tenants drunk and walked at their head blowing a posthorn Hes as mad
as a hatter
So there you have a sample conversation sketched in outline You will
find it accurate enough All you have to do is to select for yourself
the part you mean to play in it

TAXES A HOARDING AND SAVING CLAUSEA propos of an article in the
Times on this subject and a paragraph of Mr Punchs last week
anent Hoardings we may now put a supplementary question in this form
As Government taxes Savings would it not be quite consistent to tax
Hoardings Since the answer must logically be in the affirmative
let Government begin at once with all the Hoardings displaying any kind
of hideous pictorial advertisement
HE rumbles so in his conversation observed Mrs R of an orator whose
sentences were considerably involved that I can seldom catch the grist
of what he says
PRACTICAL THEOSOPHY
MRS BESANT is said to have told a representative of a daily paper that
an adept in Theosophy uses his supernatural powers solely for his own
convenience just as ordinary people avail themselves of a messenger or
the telephone or telegraph
We have it on the very best of authority that the discharge of handbills
from aerial bombs is to be entirely surpassed as a method for
advertising a commodity by a new and protected process
A Company is being formed so runs the prospectus for the express
purpose of importing Mahatmas of the very best vintage guaranteed
extra sec direct from Thibet where an exceptionally luxuriant crop
has been produced during past years
They will be shipped to any port in the United Kingdom and delivered
to any address carriage free at prices which will compare most
favourably with those quoted by foreign firms for inferior articles
The trade supplied by special contract
They will prove invaluable to advertisers and others
No family should be without one Order early
They can be used for a variety of purposes but they will be found most
particularly serviceable for distributing handbills and posters
especially in inaccessible places
Domestic servants entirely superseded by them
Prompt and accurate delivery of any object may be effected by their
agency owing to their marvellous powers of precipitation
Full instructions for working and instruments for repairing supplied
with each specimen
Not liable to get out of order
Safe in the hands of a child Yet they are not toys
Procurable of any respectable Lunatic Asylum
Ask for Our Brand and see that you get none other
Beware of worthless foreign imitations which dishonest dealers will
try to foist upon you
Of Mahatmas young and Mahatmas old
Of Mahatmas meek and Mahatmas bold
Of Mahatmas gentle and Mahatmas rough
We lay long odds that well sell enough
The financial column of the Journal of the Future we may expect will
read somewhat as followsMahatmas opened weak but slowly advanced a
third Later they became stronger and closed firm at 814
LatestMahatmas fell rapidly
Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis
CHARITY BEGINS ABROADThe following advertisement which recently
appeared in the Times has been sent for solution
GENTLEMAN with knowledge of business and disposing of
100000 francs is desirous of REPRESENTING either in
Europe Africa America or elsewhere a serious FIRM
capable of giving important profits Offers to be
addressed c
In reply to this appeal Mr Punch begs to say that the gentleman
with knowledge of business seems to be anxious to act as an alter ego
to a serious not a jocular firm capable of giving profits
GENTLEMAN does not specify whose profits the serious firm is capable
of giving and thus it may be presumed that the 100000 francs would
form the capital with which the charitable transaction would be
conducted This is the more probable as GENTLEMAN says he knows how to
dispose of them

The Irish Giant Baby At Home
The exterior of the Show is painted to represent a
Cottage and bears the highly improbable name of Polly
OGracious with an even less credible announcement
that this is the identical little cot where she was
born Inside is an ordinary tent with a rough platform
at the further end whereon is an empty chair at which
a group of small Boys two or three young Women and
some middleaged Farmlabourers have been solemnly and
patiently staring for the last quarter of an hour
First Farm Labourer to Second I bin in ere bout erf an hour I
hev and aint seed nowt so fur
Second F L Same ere Seems to take em a proper good time agittin
o this ere baby claned up
First F L Ah it do But look at the size on her
Second F L Size They cudnt be no slower not with a hellyphant
The tedium is relieved by a very audible dispute
outside between the Driver of the Babys Caravan and the
Wife of the Conjuror next door who appears to have
excited the Drivers displeasure by consenting to take
the money in the absence of the Babys proprietress
The Driver with dignity I consider it a bloomin liberty and a
downright piece of himpertinence you comin ere interferin with with
my businessand so I tell yer
The Lady with more dignity Im not taking no liberties with
nobodyshe ast me to it or I shoudnt be ereI dont want to
take the money not without bein ast to do so She come and ast me to
take her place while she was away and in course I wasnt goin to say
no
Driver Dont you tork to me I know what you are puttin yerself
forward whenever yer cana goin tellin the people on the road as you
was the Babys mother
The Lady I never said no such thing Why should I want to tell sech a
story for
Driver Arsk yourselfnot me And praps you never said you ad
valuable property in our waggin neither
Lady apparently cut to the heart by this accusation Its a
falseood I never ad no valuable property in your waggin nor yet
nobody elses and Ill thank you to keep your distance and not go
raggin me
Driver edging nearer Ill keep my distance But dont you make
no mistakeIm not to be played with Im sick o your goins on And
thenreviving a rankling and mysterious grievance to think o you a
comin mincin up on the road with yermimicking Oh yus Mrs
FAIRCHILD theres a blacksmith jest across the way What call ad you
got to shove your nose in like that eh youre a interferin cat
thats what you are
The Conjurors Lady is moved to the verge of tears and
assault and her wrath is only assuaged by the arrival
of the missing Proprietress who patches up a temporary
peace presently the hangings at the back are parted
and an immensely stout child dressed in an infants
frock waddles in hoists herself on the platform and
into the chair from which she regards the Spectators
with stolid composure the small boys edge back nudge
one another and snigger furtively the girls say Oh
lor in a whisper and a painful silence follows
A Middleaged Labourer feeling the awkwardness of the situation
Ow old may you be Missy
The Giant Baby with a snap Ten
She gazes all round with the hauteur peculiar to a
phenomenon and her visitors are only relieved from the
strain by the timely appearance of the Exhibitor a
Mulatto lady who gives a brief biographical sketch of
the Infants career with details of her weight and
measurements Then Miss POLLY sings a stanza
of Little Annie Rooney in a phonographic manner
dances a few ponderous steps and identifies the most
sheepish youth in the audiencemuch to his
embarrassmentas her sweetheart after which her
audience is permitted to shake hands with her and
depart

THE SINS OF SOCIETY
READ yesterday in the Fortnightly this article by OUIDA Resolved to
follow her teachings at once Changed my frightful grotesque and
disgraceful male costume for the most picturesque garments I hada
kilt a blue blazer and a yellow turban which I once wore at a fancy
dress ball Then strolled along Piccadilly to the Club Rather cool
Having abandoned the most vulgar form of salutation the shakehands
bowed distantly to several men I had known for yearsbut they looked
another way Met a policeman Hullo he said Come out o that Your
place is in the road He mistook me for a sandwichman Explained that
I was advocating a new style of dress Wheres yer trousers he asked
Trousers I cried Why OUIDAbut it was useless to explain to such
a foolso I left him
At the Club immense astonishment Again explained Members tapped their
foreheads and said I had better see the Doctor Why Then they all
avoided me Grand chance to show my ability to support solitude and to
endure silence Deuced dull but it saved me from the poisoned
atmosphere of crowded rooms Began to feel hungry about lunchtime but
happily remembered that it is not luxury which is enervating it is
overeating Exhausted but virtuous Remembered that I had to dine at
my aunts Awkward Could I go in that dress She is so prim and so
prejudiced in favour of trousers Also she is so rich and I was her
heir It needs money to obtain the luxury which the great teacher
advocates Hurried home and put on hateful evening dress Avoided
hansoms they being too much connected with one ugly hurryskurry and
drove to my aunts in a damp dirty fourwheeler Even the new moralist
herself would have been satisfied with the slowness of that
At dinner sat between two charming women evidently as clever as they
were beautiful Suddenly remembered that we lose the subtle and fine
flavours of our best dishes because we consider ourselves obliged to
converse with somebody and after that did not speak a word Charming
women stared and then each turned towards me a beautiful shoulder and
I saw her face no more Was just enjoying the flavours when I
recollected that nothing can make even tolerable artistically
speaking the sight of men and women sitting bolt upright close together
taking their soup We were long past the soup but it was not too late
I left the table at once and reclined elegantly on the floor with my
plate by my side AUGUSTUS said my Aunt are you ill I shook my
head I could not speak for I was just enjoying an unusually subtle
flavour Then one of the guests a member of my Club whispered to my
aunt and tapped his forehead Then she tapped her forehead and all the
guests tapped their foreheads I had finished that flavour so I said
My dear Aunt I am not mad I Then said she you must be
intoxicated Leave the house And with the butler and the footmen
escorting me to the streetdoor I was obliged to do so
It is all over I know that my Aunt will bequeath her fortune to the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ancient Buildings among the
Jews but I am consoled by the thought that I at least have followed
the noble teachings of the New Morality

Whats in a name not the first time this question has been asked and
answeredbut tis impossible for the Baron to avoid quoting it now
when in consequence of its title he was within an ace of putting aside
The Germ Growers under the impression that it was a scientific work
on Bacillus and Phylloxera On taking it up however the Baron soon
became deeply interested but was subsequently annoyed to find how the
artful author had beguiled him by leading up to a kind of imitation of
the In hoc Signo vinces legend and had somewhat adroitly adapted to
his purpose the imagery of one of the most poetic and sublime of ancient
Scripture narratives ie where the prophet sees the chariots of
Israel in the air One remarkable thing about the romance is the absence
of lovemotive and indeed the absence of all female interest Here
and there the Canon writes carelessly as instance the following
paragraph
Then he got a little glasstube into which he put
something out of a very small bottle which he took from
a number of others which lay side by side in a little
case which he took out of a pocket in the side of the
car
Apart from other faults there are too many whiches here and unlike
his malignant hero Davoli the Canon doesnt seem to be well up in
his whichcraft Clever Canon POTTER must turn out from his Potteries
