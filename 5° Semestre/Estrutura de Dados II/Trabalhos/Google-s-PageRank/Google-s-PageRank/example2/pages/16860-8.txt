A Strange Presentiment                170
A Memorable Dinner                    184
A Lover in Homespun
Onesime Charest farmer of LOrignal was a happy man As he drove
through the quaint little FrenchCanadian village on his way to the
railway station he was saluted by the villagers with much ceremony
Everyone knew perfectly well just what it was that was taking farmer
Charest to the station this beautiful hazy afternoon Over a week had
now elapsed since he received the letter from his son Zotique in the
United States saying he would be home on September 10th
Before the important communication had been in the village a day it
was common property and had been read and reread until almost every
soul in the place knew it off by heart
The wanderers return was to be made more momentous by Madame Charest
inviting a large number of guests to a party to be given by her the
evening he returned
If these worthy people were in a joyous mood the night of the party
nature appeared equally so for by the time the first haycart with
its burden of guests drove up to the scene of the festivities the
moon as though specially engaged to do duty on this honored occasion
stood right over farmer Charests house and with jovial countenance
beamed into the faces of the arriving guests and threw such a kindly
light over the farmers rough nondescript garments as to make them
look almost like good soft broadcloth It also paid flattering
attention to Madame Charest and so beautified her thin face and
silvered her grey hair as she stood in the door and welcomed the
arrivals as to make the neighbors affirmand that in a manner that
it would have been utterly useless to try and gainsaythat she looked
far younger than she did ten years ago
The lion of the hour of course was the wanderer Zotique He stood in
the main room of the house the kitchen near the long improvised
table with its burden of seductive viands and shook hands with the
guests without even the slightest tinge of the superiority which it
was thought he would and that justly assume
Notwithstanding his graciousness however he was looked upon with no
little awe He had grown so tall got so broadshouldered become the
owner of such a soft curling moustache and wore such fine clothes
and white linen as to quite throw in the shade his elder brother
Vital and the other men present who wore as was customary on all
occasionsstate or otherwisethe dark woollen suits and grey woollen
shirts with the long pointed attached collars
Had Zotique not been a sensible fellow he would surely have had his
head turned by the many flattering things said to him
It so chanced too that remarks were passed about him to his parents
and brother sotto voce which strange as it may appear managed in
some unaccountable manner always to reach his ears
He certainly has grown goodlooking very goodlooking thought
Vital as he hovered about his younger brother Although he was
sincerely glad to see him he could not altogether drive away the
shameful wish that he had been less handsome When he thought of what
it was that gave rise to the wish he felt ill at ease
Vital in every way was different from his tall younger brother He
was slimly built scarcely the average height and not prone to many
words He was given to daydreams too and often did such
absentminded things as to cause his father much mental perturbation
and at times to wish that he had not given him so much schooling but
had trained him for a farmer instead of a schoolteacher Still he was
immensely proud of his two sons and as he saw them standing together
he decided that they looked far superior to the other farmers sons
who had been given little or no education
The wanderer Zotique was only twentytwo years of age while Vital had
turned thirty
As the minutes stole by and the babel of tongues increased it might
have been noticed that both the brothers stole anxious glances at the
door Every time it opened they invariably turned to see who the
arrival was There must have been some weighty reasons for the
frequent disappointed looks which stole across their faces
At last the guests had nearly all arrived and farmer Charest his
goodnatured face all aglow intimated by much hammering on the table
that it was time they sat down to supper There being no dissenting
voice to this popular proposition a general move was made to the
benches ranged on both sides of the table By a strange coincidence
Zotique and Vital instead of going to the table with the others
gravitated toward the door
Just thought I would have a look out it is such a fine night said
Zotique as he took a long breath of fresh air
Vital looked at his robust brother in a queer constrained manner and
said that it was indeed a beautiful evening Now instead of looking
up at the queen of the night as one would naturally have expected
after such flattering comments they both as though by common
consent treated her with the most marked disrespect not once looking
toward her but bestowing all their attention on a certain little
whitewashed cottage down the road from a window of which streamed a
light
I think we had better go in said Zotique presently in a slightly
disappointed tone
Yes yes Zotique what you say is right there never was a finer
night answered Vital dreamily his eyes still fixed thoughtfully on
the cottage He was in one of his absent moods and had not heard
what his brother had said
Zotique turned looked sharply at him and then broke into a hearty
laugh You are as absentminded as ever Vital he said jestingly
as he seized him by the arm and marched him into the room
The guests were seated but there was still room for four or five
more After jeering them both for being moongazers farmer Charest
called Zotique to come and sit by his side Vital thus being left
alone wandered off to the foot of the table and sat down by the side
of an old farmer where there was plenty of room What made him go so
far for a seat when there were others nearer though not so roomy
will presently be seen Hardly had he seated himself when he did an
unaccountable thing Sitting as close as he could get to the farmer on
his right he stealthily ran his hand along the bench till it reached
his neighbor on his left The intervening space evidently was
satisfactory for a look of content came over his face and he turned
and looked once more expectantly at the door
Scarcely had the repast begun when the door was quickly opened and a
young woman clad in a bewitching white dress burst into the room
She was out of breath and had evidently been running
Do you know Madame Charest she said laughingly as she advanced
the reason I am late isbecausewell becausethe color rushed
into her face as she hesitated for a few momentsbecause it took me
so long to dress There now I have told you Father said he would
tell you all when he came just what did keep me although I coaxed him
not to Now I have spoiled the joke he was going to have on me and we
can laugh at him
This audacious thwarting of parental plans caused much laughter
during which Zotique sprang to his feet and going over to where she
was standing and laughing merrily held out his hand and said Have
you no word of welcome for me Katie White
She put her hand into the outstretched one and looking up into his
face with her bright blue eyes told him that she was very much
pleased to see him
Vital who had seen her the very moment the door opened had risen
with alacrity and in the hope that she would see the vacant seat by
his side was unconsciously crushing the hapless farmer on his right
into a most uncomfortable position The hopeful expectant look on
Vitals face deserved far better recognition than it was awarded
Despite the fact that there was but little room where Zotique was
sitting the shameless prevaricating fellow impressed upon her that
seats in that particular quarter were actually going begging
For a few moments Katie hesitated as though she hardly knew what to
do Absentminded Vital was still standing and looking at her his
whole heart in his eyes
Yes I will sit next to you it was very kind of you to take such
interest in getting me a seat
Poor Vital As he heard these ominous words saw her look up and smile
at Zotique and after great crushing sit down by his side all the
pleasure of eating left him entirely
As the good things began to disappear and tongues were loosened
unobtrusive Vital seemed to be entirely forgotten except by the
neighbor whom he had so cruelly crowded Had it not been for this
kindly unrevengeful soul Vitals inner man would have been in as
beggarly a condition at the conclusion of the meal as at the
beginning As it was it received but scant attention Seeing the
poverty of his plate without asking leave the farmer generously
filled it
This act of kindness brought Vitals thoughts to a sudden halt and
made him feel ashamed of the interest he had been displaying in all
the young woman seated at his brothers side had been doing and
saying With a firm determination no longer to slight his plate he
turned his attention to it but had scarcely eaten two mouthfuls when
his treacherous thoughts stole off to Katie again Absently laying his
knife and fork down he was soon unconscious of all that was going on
around him
His friendly neighbor decided it would be a most opportune time to
pass the salt and thus give him another hint that he was losing much
valuable time
Oh thank you said Vital absently as he took the salt and
proceeded to distribute it over his meat in such reckless quantities
as to completely entomb the latter For a space the farmer looked
aghast and then with a mystified shake of his head turned his
attention to his own affairs and did not look at him again till the
time for speechmaking had arrived Then to his consternation he saw
Vital had not made the slightest effort to extricate the hapless meat
from its strange covering Besides the farmer another person had
witnessed the adventures of Vitals plate
After considerable solicitation and stimulating applause farmer
Charest rose to deliver the first speech As dare are he began in
broken English a few farmer here who not spick de French lanwige I
will try for spick a few words in Anglish I know I not spick de
lanwige vary much but my son Zotique who just come from de States
he spick Anglish just so well as de Anglish and so he mak you spich
better dan I mak
He turned and laid his hand affectionately on Zotiques head Zotique
colored at the unexpected compliment and looking down into Miss Katie
Whites bright blue eyes smiled and shook his head deprecatingly
She looked up smiled and nodded her compact little head as though
she thought the compliment was fully deserved
Vital who had eyes for only one person in the room saw the look
Zotique gave her and her apparent appreciation of it and longed to
be out in the little garden at the back of the house
I not mak some vary long spich went on the orator as I know dat
you all rather have de dance Den I see too dat my friend Magloire
Meloche down dare he look many time at de fiddle he brought and hang
on de wall This bantering allusion to the veteran fiddleplayer of
the district caused a hearty outburst of laughter and applause
All I want for say continued the speaker rubbing his hands briskly
with gratified pride is dat me and my femme we both glad dat my
son Zotique he come from de States to pay us de visit My son he do
well in de States where dare is vary much place for work When he
write to say dat he pay us de visit my femme she say she mak dis
little pleasure so dat you all see him My son Zotique he now spick
Had farmer Charest been a second Mark Antony the recognition of his
oratorical ability could not have been more marked Certain it is that
that renowned orator could not have borne more becomingly the honors
showered upon him
Very handsome Zotique looked as he rose and he spoke in English which
fully justified the goodly remarks passed upon it by his father
Vitals heart beat fast with pride as he looked at his handsome
brother until it occurred to him how insignificant Katie White must
think him in comparison
Before Zotique had spoken many words he had completely won the hearts
of his hearers Quite fluently he told them of the cities he had
visited in the States and how a grocery clerks life was one much to
be desired He interspersed little jokes in his speech at which he
laughed just as heartily and sincerely as his listeners More than
once he was on the point of concluding when a glance at Katie Whites
sweet face incited him to fresh efforts
It was a speech remembered and spoken of for many days
Before the dancing began farmer Charest declared despite the
increasing and obvious restlessness of Magloire Meloche to get at the
fiddle that they must have a speech in English from his eldest son
Vital And my son Vital he has mak me a good son if he do like to
tink alone too much and sometime do forgetful ting Very
affectionate was the look he gave Vital who had been with him always
and for whom it was not necessary to kill the fatted calf
If there was anything Vital was an adept at not doing it was making a
speech in English He was considered quite clever at playing the organ
in the little village church singing the mass teaching school and a
hundred other things but at speaking English he was known as an
arrant failure
For a few moments he stood struggling hard to regain his composure
and ardently wishing that Katie were at his side to inspire him as she
had inspired his brother Finally he launched forth to the quiet
amusement of the few English farmers present Truly he took liberties
with the language seldom attempted even by FrenchCanadians to whom
the Saxon tongue appears to have no terrors Yet had he spoken in
Dutch he would have been listened to just as patiently for all
present knew and appreciated his quiet worth After accomplishing the
feat of letting them know at least half a dozen times that he was
glad once more to see his brother with them he got hopelessly
wrecked and gazed hard at his plate for inspiration Finding no
succor there his thoughts again galloped off to the young woman who
had come late where they evidently delighted to linger A peaceful
smile stole over the speakers worried face and absently taking up
his fork he began to drum contentedly on the table with it utterly
forgetful of those who were waiting anxiously for the remainder of his
remarks
With a broad smile farmer Charest began to applaud loudly receiving
generous aid from the guests
This unexpected appreciation caused Vital to color painfully well
intentioned though he knew the applause to be The thought that Katie
must be again contrasting him with Zotique kept the crimson hue on his
face long after he sat down The few remaining words which he spoke
were in continued praise of his brother of whose cleverness both he
and his parents were very proud
After the clapping of hands had subsided the table was carried away
to make room for the dancing
Feeling that he had utterly disgraced himself in Katies eyes Vital
wandered off to a quiet corner where he could see her without
attracting attention It seemed to him once or twice that she looked
over inquiringly in his direction but the thought that it was
presumptuous of him to imagine she would think of him now made him
quickly decide that he had been mistaken as to the direction of her
glances He was also convinced now that he had made a still more
serious mistake when he allowed himself to hope that she had
cherished tender thoughts of the many walks they had taken along the
quiet country road and of the evenings he had spent with her
Fearing to be thought unsociable he rose hastily and was soon
talking to the guests with unusual eagerness His sudden lapses into
thought however created the impression in the minds of some of his
listeners that he was laboring under suppressed excitement
At times when he found himself drifting unconsciously toward Katie
it was amusing to see what a hasty retreat he would beat
As for Zotique he had never enjoyed himself more Scarcely for a
moment did he leave Katies side Brightly he talked to her of their
schooldays and of the many pleasant parties they had met at before he
went away When presently he asked her about a certain little
present which he had sent her a few months before his voice grew very
tender as also indeed did his eyes It took considerable questioning
before she admitted that she had not parted with it After this slight
admission he grew more chatty than ever and failed to notice that her
manner was growing a little constrained
Finally the floor was cleared and Magloire Meloche with much
dignity took down the doughty fiddle seated himself cast his eyes
calmly over the expectant guests and began slowly to tune up From
the expression of his face it was quite apparent that he had a keen
appreciation of the important part he had been called upon to occupy
in the evenings festivities Besides constituting the entire
orchestra he was floor manager and called out the figures The gusto
with which he cried out Swing your pardner Now tak de hand all
round etc and beat time with his huge moccasined foot added in no
inconsiderable degree to the excitement
It being well known that Vital did not dance no comments were passed
upon his absence The poor fellow had tried to stay and watch the
dancing but the pain at his heart had grown so on seeing Zotiques
arm around her waist that he really could not endure it and so had
gone out to the little garden at the back of the house and was
sitting on his favorite seat under a huge birch tree whose thick
foliage the inquisitive moon could scarcely pierce
Through the open kitchen door there floated to him at intervals the
playing of the fiddle and the commanding tones of Magloire Meloche
Finally the music ceased and some of the dancers came out into the
garden to view the beauty of the night Vital was just in the act of
rising when a couple whom he recognized as his brother and Katie
White came within a few yards of him Where he sat the shadows were
too deep for them to see him
Before he could escape they paused for a few moments near the outer
branches of the great birch where the lavish moon beamed clear as
noonday Their faces were distinctly revealed Zotiques bore an
intensely eager look while Katies was strangely agitated They were
talking earnestly Dreading they might think he was eavesdropping
Vital was about to make his presence known when they began slowly to
move away and there fell upon his ears words that bereft him of
speech It was his brothers voice low and pleading Before I went
away I loved you and I have loved you ever since I was so anxious to
see you that I came back You are surprised at me telling you
tonight but I can only stay a few days If you will only give me
your promise I
The voice died away in the distance
The shadows where Vital stood suddenly assumed a more sombre hue and
widened and deepened and spread until the whole garden was enveloped
in a funereal pall
The ancient garden seat groaned audibly as he sank back heavily upon
it the shock drove the gathering blackness away Never in his life
before had he been so sorely moved his pale face had almost a ghastly
hue while his hands shook painfully He rose mechanically and passed
out into the moonlight and looked around absently There was no one
in sight and all was quiet He began to move in the direction of the
house He appeared to have forgotten all about the festivities he was
simply weary and was going home to rest
Tak your pardners for de nex waltz A moment of preliminary
scraping then the tune and finally the muffled scuffling of feet
fell upon his ears Then it all came back to him and turning
hurriedly he walked away from the house to the far end of the garden
Resting his arms on the fence he stood bathed in the moonlight
trying to think it all out calmly and get courage to return and act
as though nothing had happened While he stood battling with his
rebellious heart he might have noticed had he been facing the house
a young woman dressed in white come to the door soon after the dance
had started and look around the garden as if searching for someone
Finally her eyes travelled to the far end of the garden where a
lonely despondentlooking figure was standing and then she started
eagerly forward Very lovely was the color in her cheeks as she sped
toward him As she was about to lay her hand on his arm she appeared
to grow irresolute She paused and looked back at the house as though
meditating upon the advisability of returning and actually did take a
few steps towards it but again hesitated and looked back the
pathetic droop of his shoulders affected her keenly and she stole
back to him again Bending her little head till it was near his she
said softly Dreaming again Vital
The foolish fellow turned and looked at her as though he had utterly
abandoned all faith in the veracity of his hitherto faithful eyes
Katie Katie White he exclaimed
She laughed outright Yes Katie White Did you think it was my
ghost Of course if you are not glad to see me and would rather be
alone I can go back to the house again
Sly Katie
It was marvellous the way the look of misery fled from his face while
the sudden growth of his friendliness was nothing less than
astounding Taking her little hand in his he shook it repeatedly and
impressed upon her over and over again that he had never been more
surprised in his life
Suddenly she put on a most serious look and leaning back against the
fence looked up into his face and said gravely Even if you dont
dance Vital I think it was a little rude of you to leave the house
for so long and scarcely speak to anyone the whole evening And the
way you acted too at dinner Vital I cant understand it
In the happiness of having Katie near him he had forgotten all about
the scene he had witnessed near the great birch tree and the dreadful
words that had floated to him and had almost stopped the beating of
his heart Of course she was his brothers now How foolishly he had
been acting and how painful to her must have been his extravagant joy
at seeing her The reference she had made to the dinner made his
humiliation still keener to bear for he thought she alluded to his
unhappy speech
The sudden flight of happiness from his face made her own grow grave
and she drew a little closer to him but in his humiliation he did not
notice it He thought she was haughtily waiting for him to speak In
his quaint halting English he began to tell her that he feared he had
been most discourteous The truth was he had not meant to stay away
so long but had got thinking ofof
Thinking of what Vital
Was he mistaken Was not that a kindly ring in her voice It was hard
to keep his eyes from her face Then he thought of his brother and he
was sure his ears had deceived him After a painful pause he answered
that he had been thinking of many things Not for a moment did he
dream of letting her know that she had been the magnet around which
all his thoughts had revolved Then he began to explain about that
speech Hardly had he begun to apologize for his lack of oratorical
ability when a pained expression swept across Katies face and she
was about to reproach him for thinking she would be so ungenerous as
to upbraid him for such a thing when a spirit of mischief entered her
heart and putting on a serious air she let him continue He finally
wound up by praising his brothers wonderful gift of speech
Oh yes she replied warmly Zotique is a great speaker and such a
dancer She stole a swift glance at him His eyes were still fixed on
the trees in the distance A queer little smile stole around the
corners of her mouth He admitted with a valiant effort to throw a
little enthusiasm into his voice that Zotique was indeed a grand
dancer The smile which was in no way scornful deepened on her face
And he is so polite to ladies and takes such trouble to provide them
with seats at crowded tables Katie went on reflectively
He stole a hasty glance at her face but quick as he was she was
quicker the smile had vanished He saw only a deeply thoughtful
expression
To think of Katie praising Zotique for providing her with a seat If
she only knew how she was wounding him but he was sure she did not
He wondered what she would think if she only knew that the failure of
his speech had been largely due to not having had the privilege of
providing her with a seat He thought of how anxiously he had watched
the door for her and how Zotique had upset all his plans by going so
fearlessly up to her and taking her to the seat at his side He
wondered she had not noticed how he had stood up all the time she had
been talking to his brother and how in that way he had tried to get
her to notice the generous vacant space at his side There was nothing
to be done now but to let Katie misunderstand him to let her know the
true state of his feelings would be treachery to Zotique
In a low voice he admitted Zotiques superiority over him also in the
capacity of politeness
It is wonderful how cruel maidens can be at times In a tone in which
there was just the slightest shade of reproach Katie told him that
she really had expected him to show her a little more attention
considering how very long they had been friends Perhaps however his
lack of attention had been due to his feeling unwell she had seen how
he had hardly eaten anything Illhealth would account too for the
tremendous covering of salt he had put over his meat
Poor Vital This was dreadful she had misunderstood him in
everything She would never know that his prodigality with the salt
had been due to the perversity of his heart in longing for what it
would now never possess Manfully he stuck to the thankless part he
had to play and admitted that illhealth had something to do with his
strange behavior
The trees were beginning to assume gigantic shapes and to get mixed up
with the horizon and his eyes were aching He was suffering keenly
Finally his eyes rested on the ground A new trouble had arisen and
was torturing him he thought it was his duty to congratulate her on
her engagement with his brother If he wished her happiness without
waiting for her to tell him about the engagement she perhaps would
see that he was not quite so impolite as she had thought him It was
hard to commence Distressfully his hand caressed the rough fence
Katie glanced at him stealthily the troubled look on his face smote
her to the heart She was ashamed of her cruelty
Trying to piece his barren English so it would not offend Vital
finally told her how glad he was that she was going to be his
brothers wife He dwelt upon Zotiques manliness and how he was
quite sure she would never be sorry that she had chosen him
She gazed at him in amazement Marry Zotique she queried aghast
He thought her surprise was due to his knowledge of the engagement so
he hastened with much delicacy to explain that he had not meant to
listen Zotique of course had been very much in earnest and had
spoken a little loudly to her as they passed the birch tree that was
how he came to know so soon
As Katie noted Vitals innate tact and delicacy and saw how bravely
he was suffering and knew that it was all due to her cruelty her
lips began to tremble pitifully and her eyes filled with tears She
tried hard not to break down but her heart reproached her so fiercely
that there was no use struggling and so resting her arms on the fence
she buried her face in them and burst into remorseful tears
Had the earth yawned and swallowed the trees in the distance Vitals
consternation could not have been greater Had Katie laughed he would
not have been surprised but to break into such heartrending sobs He
was by her side in an instant his sensitive face all aglow with
sympathy Laying his hand lightly on her arm he told her how sorry he
was for having caused her such bitter grief He should have known
better and not have mentioned her engagement until she had first told
him of it He only now realized how embarrassing his conversation must
have been to her
Instead of diminishing her sorrow these kindly words caused Katies
shoulders to heave still more quickly and made the sobs more bitter
Miserably Vital stood by her side utterly at a loss to know what to
do everything he had done and said had given her pain For the first
time in his life he wished he never had been born
He did not again attempt to speak but stood quietly at her side At
last the sobs ceased and then with downcast eyes Katie stepped to his
side and slipped her arm hesitatingly through his The touch of her
hand thrilled him Thinking that she wanted him to take her back to
the house and was too angry to speak to him he turned and with the
moon full in their faces they began silently to walk toward the house
As they neared it the sounds of the violin and the merrymaking grew
more distinct He thought of the happiness awaiting her there and the
bitterness for him and his heart rebelled fiercely
Near the house partly shaded by a friendly appletree was a bench
where Vital often sat When they reached it Katie let go of his arm
and seated herself upon it
She wants to be alone until she can compose herself to go into the
house he thought and was hurrying away when she called to him He
retraced his steps and stood before her
Sit down Vital
This time he had not made a mistake there was something in the tone
of her voice which made him tremble with happiness Willingly he
obeyed the invitation
For a few moments she sat and twined her fingers together nervously
She knew how dear she was to him and wanted to make amends
I have been very cruel to you tonight Vital she began in a low
uneven tone
Wrathfully he began to deny such an outrageous statement
I thought you would like to know she continued falteringly when
his indignation had somewhat subsided that you are mistaken in that
about Zotique and me we are not engaged IItold him no It was
hard to tell him this but she had treated him so very badly and had
taken such an unfair advantage of his trusting nature
The sudden relief from the restraint he had borne so long made him
lose command of himself altogether He sprang quickly to his feet and
looking down at the fair averted face said with the lovelight
beaming in his eyes I love you too Katie It was only after the
words were spoken that he realized his amazing boldness As he stood
abashed a warm sweet hand crept into his The daring fellow held it
tightly
I cant tell you how glad I am that you love me for I love you
