the mansionseat of a family and answers to what we call in English
DEMESNES It is in France computed at about 1600 feet round the house
that being supposed to be the extent of the capons flight from la basse
cour This little district must go along with the mansionseat however
the rest of the estate may be divided
I do not mean that you should be a French lawyer but I would not have
you unacquainted with the general principles of their law in matters
that occur every day Such is the nature of their descents that is the
inheritance of lands Do they all go to the eldest son or are they
equally divided among the children of the deceased In England all lands
unsettled descend to the eldest son as heiratlaw unless otherwise
disposed of by the fathers will except in the county of Kent where a
particular custom prevails called Gavelkind by which if the father
dies intestate all his children divide his lands equally among them In
Germany as you know all lands that are not fiefs are equally divided
among all the children which ruins those families but all male fiefs of
the empire descend unalienably to the next male heir which preserves
those families In France I believe descents vary in different
provinces
The nature of marriage contracts deserves inquiry In England the
general practice is the husband takes all the wifes fortune and in
consideration of it settles upon her a proper pinmoney as it is called
that is an annuity during his life and a jointure after his death In
France it is not so particularly at Paris where la communaute des
biens is established Any married woman at Paris IF YOU ARE ACQUAINTED
WITH ONE can inform you of all these particulars
These and other things of the same nature are the useful and rational
objects of the curiosity of a man of sense and business Could they only
be attained by laborious researches in foliobooks and wormeaten
manuscripts I should not wonder at a young fellows being ignorant of
them but as they are the frequent topics of conversation and to be
known by a very little degree of curiosity inquiry and attention it is
unpardonable not to know them
Thus I have given you some hints only for your inquiries lEtat de la
France lAlmanach Royal and twenty other such superficial books will
furnish you with a thousand more Approfondissez
How often and how justly have I since regretted negligences of this
kind in my youth And how often have I since been at great trouble to
learn many things which I could then have learned without any Save
yourself now then I beg of you that regret and trouble hereafter Ask
questions and many questions and leave nothing till you are thoroughly
informed of it Such pertinent questions are far from being illbred or
troublesome to those of whom you ask them on the contrary they are a
tacit compliment to their knowledge and people have a better opinion of
a young man when they see him desirous to be informed
I have by last post received your two letters of the 1st and 5th of
January N S I am very glad that you have been at all the shows at
Versailles frequent the courts I can conceive the murmurs of the French
at the poorness of the fireworks by which they thought their king of
their country degraded and in truth were things always as they should
be when kings give shows they ought to be magnificent
I thank you for the These de la Sorbonne which you intend to send me
and which I am impatient to receive But pray read it carefully yourself
first and inform yourself what the Sorbonne is by whom founded and for
what puraoses
Since you have time you have done very well to take an Italian and a
German master but pray take care to leave yourelf time enough for
company for it is in company only that you can learn what will be much
more useful to you than either Italian or German I mean la politesse
les manieres et les graces without which as I told you long ago and I
told you true ogni fatica a vana Adieu
Pray make my compliments to Lady Brown
LETTER CLVI
LONDON January 6 O S 1752
MY DEAR FRIEND
I recommended to you in my last some inquiries into the constitution of
that famous society the Sorbonne but as I cannot wholly trust to the
diligence of those inquiries I will give you here the outlines of that
establishment which may possibly excite you to inform yourself of
particulars which you are more a portee to know than I am
It was founded by Robert de Sorbon in the year 1256 for sixteen poor
scholars in divinity four of each nation of the university of which it
made a part since that it hath been much extended and enriched
especially by the liberality and pride of Cardinal Richelieu who made it
a magnificent building for sixandthirty doctors of that society to live
in besides which there are six professors and schools for divinity
This society has long been famous for theological knowledge and
exercitations There unintelligible points are debated with passion
though they can never be determined by reason Logical subtilties set
common sense at defiance and mystical refinements disfigure and disguise
the native beauty and simplicity of true natural religion wild
imaginations form systems which weak minds adopt implicitly and which
sense and reason oppose in vain their voice is not strong enough to be
heard in schools of divinity Political views are by no means neglected
in those sacred places and questions are agitated and decided according
to the degree of regard or rather submission which the Sovereign is
pleased to show the Church Is the King a slave to the Church though a
tyrant to the laity The least resistance to his will shall be declared
damnable But if he will not acknowledge the superiority of their
spiritual over his temporal nor even admit their imperium in imperio
which is the least they will compound for it becomes meritorious not
only to resist but to depose him And I suppose that the bold
propositions in the thesis you mention are a return for the valuation of
les biens du Clerge
I would advise you by all means to attend to two or three of their
public disputations in order to be informed both of the manner and the
substance of those scholastic exercises Pray remember to go to all those
kind of things Do not put it off as one is too apt to do those things
which one knows can be done every day or any day for one afterward
repents extremely when too late the not having done them
But there is another socalled religious society of which the minutest
circumstance deserves attention and furnishes great matter for useful
reflections You easily guess that I mean the society of les R R P P
Jesuites established but in the year 1540 by a Bull of Pope Paul III
Its progress and I may say its victories were more rapid than those of
the Romans for within the same century it governed all Europe and in
the next it extended its influence over the whole world Its founder was
an abandoned profligate Spanish officer Ignatius Loyola who in the
year 1521 being wounded in the leg at the siege of Pampeluna went mad
from the smart of his wound the reproaches of his conscience and his
confinement during which he read the lives of the Saints Consciousness
of guilt a fiery temper and a wild imagination the common ingredients
of enthusiasm made this madman devote himself to the particular service
of the Virgin Mary whose knighterrant he declared himself in the very
same form in which the old knighterrants in romances used to declare
themselves the knights and champions of certain beautiful and
incomparable princesses whom sometimes they had but oftener had not
seen For Dulcinea del Toboso was by no means the first princess whom her
faithful and valorous knight had never seen in his life The enthusiast
went to the Holy Land from whence he returned to Spain where he began
to learn Latin and philosophy at threeandthirty years old so that no
doubt but he made great progress in both The better to carry on his mad
and wicked designs he chose four disciples or rather apostles all
Spaniards viz Laynes Salmeron Bobadilla and Rodriguez He then
composed the rules and constitutions of his order which in the year
1547 was called the order of Jesuits from the church of Jesus in Rome
which was given them Ignatius died in 1556 aged sixtyfive thirtyfive
years after his conversion and sixteen years after the establishment of
his society He was canonized in the year 1609 and is doubtless now a
saint in heaven
If the religious and moral principles of this society are to be detested
as they justly are the wisdom of their political principles is as justly
to be admired Suspected collectively as an order of the greatest
crimes and convicted of many they have either escaped punishment or
triumphed after it as in France in the reign of Henry IV They have
directly or indirectly governed the consciences and the councils of all
the Catholic princes in Europe they almost governed China in the reign
of Cangghi and they are now actually in possession of the Paraguay in
America pretending but paying no obedience to the Crown of Spain As a
collective body they are detested even by all the Catholics not
excepting the clergy both secular and regular and yet as individuals
they are loved respected and they govern wherever they are
Two things I believe contribute to their success The first that
passive implicit unlimited obedience to their General who always
resides at Rome and to the superiors of their several houses appointed
by him This obedience is observed by them all to a most astonishing
degree and I believe there is no one society in the world of which so
many individuals sacrifice their private interest to the general one of
the society itself The second is the education of youth which they have
in a manner engrossed there they give the first and the first are the
lasting impressions those impressions are always calculated to be
favorable to the society I have known many Catholics educated by the
Jesuits who though they detested the society from reason and
knowledge have always remained attached to it from habit and prejudice
The Jesuits know better than any set of people in the world the
importance of the art of pleasing and study it more they become all
things to all men in order to gain not a few but many In Asia Africa
and America they become more than half pagans in order to convert the
pagans to be less than half Christians In private families they begin by
insinuating themselves as friends they grow to be favorites and they
end DIRECTORS Their manners are not like those of any other regulars in
the world but gentle polite and engaging They are all carefully bred
up to that particular destination to which they seem to have a natural
turn for which reason one sees most Jesuits excel in some particular
thing They even breed up some for martyrdom in case of need as the
superior of a Jesuit seminary at Rome told Lord Bolingbroke E abbiamo
anche martiri per il martirio se bisogna
Inform yourself minutely of everything concerning this extraordinary
establishment go into their houses get acquainted with individuals
hear some of them preach The finest preacher I ever heard in my life is
le Pere Neufville who I believe preaches still at Paris and is so
much in the best company that you may easily get personally acquainted
with him
If you would know their morale read Pascals Lettres Provinciales in
which it is very truly displayed from their own writings
Upon the whole this is certain that a society of which so little good
is said and so much ill believed and that still not only subsists but
flourishes must be a very able one It is always mentioned as a proof of
the superior abilities of the Cardinal Richelieu that though hated by
all the nation and still more by his master he kept his power in spite
of both
I would earnestly wish you to do everything now which I wish that I had
done at your age and did not do Every country has its peculiarities
which one can be much better informed of during ones residence there
than by reading all the books in the world afterward While you are in
Catholic countries inform yourself of all the forms and ceremonies of
that tawdry church see their converts both of men and women know their
several rules and orders attend their most remarkable ceremonies have
their terms of art explained to you their tierce sexte nones
matines vepres complies their breviares rosaires heures
chapelets agnus etc things that many people talk of from habit
though few people know the true meaning of anyone of them Converse with
and study the characters of some of those incarcerated enthusiasts
Frequent some parloirs and see the air and manners of those Recluse
who are a distinct nation themselves and like no other
I dined yesterday with Mrs Fd her mother and husband He is an
athletic Hibernian handsome in his person but excessively awkward and
vulgar in his air and manner She inquired much after you and I
thought with interest I answered her as a Mezzano should do Et je
pronai votre tendresse vos soins et vos soupirs
When you meet with any British returning to their own country pray send
me by them any little brochures factums theses etc qui font du
bruit ou du plaisir a Paris Adieu child
LETTER CLVII
LONDON January 23 O S 1752
MY DEAR FRIEND Have you seen the new tragedy of VaronWritten by the
Vicomte de Grave and at that time the general topic of conversation at
Parisand what do you think of it Let me know for I am determined to
form my taste upon yours I hear that the situations and incidents are
well brought on and the catastrophe unexpected and surprising but the
verses bad I suppose it is the subject of all conversations at Paris
where both women and men are judges and critics of all such performances
such conversations that both form and improve the taste and whet the
judgment are surely preferable to the conversations of our mixed
companies here which if they happen to rise above bragg and whist
infallibly stop short of everything either pleasing or instructive
I take the reason of this to be that as women generally give the ton
to the conversation our English women are not near so well informed and
cultivated as the French besides that they are naturally more serious
and silent
I could wish there were a treaty made between the French and English
theatres in which both parties should make considerable concessions The
English ought to give up their notorious violations of all the unities
and all their massacres racks dead bodies and mangled carcasses which
they so frequently exhibit upon their stage The French should engage to
have more action and less declamation and not to cram and crowd things
together to almost a degree of impossibility from a too scrupulous
adherence to the unities The English should restrain the licentiousness
of their poets and the French enlarge the liberty of theirs their poets
are the greatest slaves in their country and that is a bold word ours
are the most tumultuous subjects in England and that is saying a good
deal Under such regulations one might hope to see a play in which one
should not be lulled to sleep by the length of a monotonical declamation
nor frightened and shocked by the barbarity of the action The unity of
time extended occasionally to three or four days and the unity of place
broke into as far as the same street or sometimes the same town both
which I will affirm are as probable as fourandtwenty hours and the
same room
More indulgence too in my mind should be shown than the French are
willing to allow to bright thoughts and to shining images for though
I confess it is not very natural for a hero or a princess to say fine
things in all the violence of grief love rage etc yet I can as well
suppose that as I can that they should talk to themselves for half an
hour which they must necessarily do or no tragedy could be carried on
unless they had recourse to a much greater absurdity the choruses of the
ancients Tragedy is of a nature that one must see it with a degree of
selfdeception we must lend ourselves a little to the delusion and I am
very willing to carry that complaisance a little farther than the French
do
Tragedy must be something bigger than life or it would not affect us In
nature the most violent passions are silent in tragedy they must speak
and speak with dignity too Hence the necessity of their being written in
verse and unfortunately for the French from the weakness of their
language in rhymes And for the same reason Cato the Stoic expiring at
Utica rhymes masculine and feminine at Paris and fetches his last
breath at London in most harmmonious and correct blank verse
It is quite otherwise with Comedy which should be mere common life and
not one jot bigger Every character should speak upon the stage not only
what it would utter in the situation there represented but in the same
manner in which it would express it For which reason I cannot allow
rhymes in comedy unless they were put into the mouth and came out of
the mouth of a mad poet But it is impossible to deceive ones self
enough nor is it the least necessary in comedy to suppose a dull rogue
of an usurer cheating or gross Jean blundering in the finest rhymes in
the world
As for Operas they are essentially too absurd and extravagant to
mention I look upon them as a magic scene contrived to please the eyes
and the ears at the expense of the understanding and I consider
singing rhyming and chiming heroes and princesses and philosophers
as I do the hills the trees the birds and the beasts who amicably
joined in one common country dance to the irresistible turn of Orpheuss
lyre Whenever I go to an opera I leave my sense and reason at the door
with my half guinea and deliver myself up to my eyes and my ears
Thus I have made you my poetical confession in which I have acknowledged
as many sins against the established taste in both countries as a frank
heretic could have owned against the established church in either but I
am now privileged by my age to taste and think for myself and not to
care what other people think of me in those respects an advantage which
youth among its many advantages hath not It must occasionally and
outwardly conform to a certain degree to establish tastes fashions
and decisions A young man may with a becoming modesty dissent in
private companies from public opinions and prejudices but he must not
attack them with warmth nor magisterially set up his own sentiments
against them Endeavor to hear and know all opinions receive them with
complaisance form your own with coolness and give it with modesty
I have received a letter from Sir John Lambert in which he requests me
to use my interest to procure him the remittance of Mr Spencers money
when he goes abroad and also desires to know to whose account he is to
place the postage of my letters I do not trouble him with a letter in
answer since you can execute the commission Pray make my compliments to
him and assure him that I will do all I can to procure him Mr Spencers
business but that his most effectual way will be by Messrs Hoare who
are Mr Spencers cashiers and who will undoubtedly have their choice
upon whom they will give him his credit As for the postage of the
letters your purse and mine being pretty near the same do you pay it
over and above your next draught
Your relations the Princes B will soon be with you at Paris for
they leave London this week whenever you converse with them I desire it
may be in Italian that language not being yet familiar enough to you
By our printed papers there seems to be a sort of compromise between the
King and the parliament with regard to the affairs of the hospitals by
taking them out of the hands of the Archbishop of Paris and placing them
in Monsieur dArgensons if this be true that compromise as it is
called is clearly a victory on the side of the court and a defeat on
the part of the parliament for if the parliament had a right they had
it as much to the exclusion of Monsieur dArgenson as of the Archbishop
Adieu
LETTER CLVIII
LONDON February 6 O S 1752
MY DEAR FRIEND Your criticism of Varon is strictly just but in truth
severe You French critics seek for a fault as eagerly as I do for a
beauty you consider things in the worst light to show your skill at
the expense of your pleasure I view them in the best that I may have
more pleasure though at the expense of my judgment A trompeur trompeur
et demi is prettily said and if you please you may call Varon un
Normand and Sostrate un Manceau qui vaut un Normand et demi and
considering the denouement in the light of trick upon trick it would
undoubtedly be below the dignity of the buskin and fitter for the sock
But let us see if we cannot bring off the author The great question upon
which all turns is to discover and ascertain who Cleonice really is
There are doubts concerning her etat how shall they be cleared Had
the truth been extorted from Varon who alone knew by the rack it would
have been a true tragical denouement But that would probably not have
done with Varon who is represented as a bold determined wicked and at
that time desperate fellow for he was in the hands of an enemy who he
knew could not forgive him with common prudence or safety The rack
would therefore have extorted no truth from him but he would have died
enjoying the doubts of his enemies and the confusion that must
necessarily attend those doubts A stratagem is therefore thought of to
discover what force and terror could not and the stratagem such as no
king or minister would disdain to get at an important discovery If you
call that stratagem a TRICK you vilify it and make it comical but call
that trick a STRATAGEM or a MEASURE and you dignify it up to tragedy
so frequently do ridicule or dignity turn upon one single word It is
commonly said and more particularly by Lord Shaftesbury that ridicule
is the best test of truth for that it will not stick where it is not
just I deny it A truth learned in a certain light and attacked in
certain words by men of wit and humor may and often doth become
ridiculous at least so far that the truth is only remembered and
repeated for the sake of the ridicule The overturn of Mary of Medicis
into a river where she was halfdrowned would never have been
remembered if Madame de Vernuel who saw it had not said la Reine
boit Pleasure or malignity often gives ridicule a weight which it does
not deserve The versification I must confess is too much neglected and
too often bad but upon the whole I read the play with pleasure
If there is but a great deal of wit and character in your new comedy I
will readily compound for its having little or no plot I chiefly mind
dialogue and character in comedies Let dull critics feed upon the
carcasses of plays give me the taste and the dressing
I am very glad you went to Versailles to see the ceremony of creating the
Prince de Conde Chevalier de l Ordre and I do not doubt but that upon
this occasion you informed yourself thoroughly of the institution and
rules of that order If you did you were certainly told it was
instituted by Henry III immediately after his return or rather his
flight from Poland he took the hint of it at Venice where he had seen
the original manuscript of an order of the St Esprit ou droit desir
which had been instituted in 1352 by Louis dAnjou King of Jerusalem
and Sicily and husband to Jane Queen of Naples Countess of Provence
This Order was under the protection of St Nicholas de Bari whose image
hung to the collar Henry III found the Order of St Michael prostituted
and degraded during the civil wars he therefore joined it to his new
Order of the St Esprit and gave them both together for which reason
every knight of the St Esprit is now called Chevalier des Ordres du Roi
The number of the knights hath been different but is now fixed to ONE
HUNDRED exclusive of the sovereign There are many officers who wear
the riband of this Order like the other knights and what is very
singular is that these officers frequently sell their employments but
obtain leave to wear the blue riband still though the purchasers of
those offices wear it also
As you will have been a great while in France people will expect that
you should be au fait of all these sort of things relative to that
country But the history of all the Orders of all countries is well worth
your knowledge the subject occurs often and one should not be ignorant
of it for fear of some such accident as happened to a solid Dane at
Paris who upon seeing LOrdre du St Esprit said Notre St Esprit
chez nous cest un Elephant Almost all the princes in Germany have
their Orders too not dated indeed from any important events or
directed to any great object but because they will have orders to show
that they may as some of them who have the jus cudendae monetae
borrow ten shillings worth of gold to coin a ducat However wherever you
meet with them inform yourself and minute down a short account of them
they take in all the colors of Sir Isaac Newtons prisms N B When you
inquire about them do not seem to laugh
I thank you for le Mandement de Monseigneur lArcheveyue it is very well
drawn and becoming an archbishop But pray do not lose sight of a much
more important object I mean the political disputes between the King and
the parliament and the King and the clergy they seem both to be
patching up but however get the whole clue to them as far as they
have gone
I received a letter yesterday from Madame Monconseil who assures me you
have gained ground du cote des maniires and that she looks upon you to
be plus qua moitie chemin I am very glad to hear this because if
you are got above half way of your journey surely you will finish it
and not faint in the course Why do you think I have this affair so
extremely at heart and why do I repeat it so often Is it for your sake
or for mine You can immediately answer yourself that question you
certainly haveI cannot possibly have any interest in it If then you
will allow me as I believe you may to be a judge of what is useful and
necessary to you you must in consequence be convinced of the infinite
importance of a point which I take so much pains to inculcate
I hear that the new Duke of Orleans a remercie Monsieur de Melfort and
I believe pas sans raison having had obligations to him mais il ne
la pas remercie en mari poli but rather roughly Il faut que ce soit
un bourru I am told too that people get bits of his fathers rags by
way of relies I wish them joy they will do them a great deal of good
See from hence what weaknesses human nature is capable of and make
allowances for such in all your plans and reasonings Study the
characters of the people you have to do with and know what they are
instead of thinking them what they should be address yourself generally
to the senses to the heart and to the weaknesses of mankind but very
rarely to their reason
Goodnight or goodmorrow to you according to the time you shall receive
this letter from Yours
LETTER CLIX
LONDON February 14 O S 1752
MY DEAR FRIEND In a months time I believe I shall have the pleasure of
sending you and you will have the pleasure of reading a work of Lord
Bolingbrokes in two volumes octavo Upon the Use of History in
several letters to Lord Hyde then Lord Cornbury It is now put into the
press It is hard to determine whether this work will instruct or please
most the most material historical facts from the great era of the
treaty of Munster are touched upon accompanied by the most solid
reflections and adorned by all that elegance of style which was peculiar
to himself and in which if Cicero equals he certainly does not exceed
him but every other writer falls short of him I would advise you almost
to get this book by heart I think you have a turn to history you love
it and have a memory to retain it this book will teach you the proper
use of it Some people load their memories indiscriminately with
historical facts as others do their stomachs with food and bring out
the one and bring up the other entirely crude and undigested You will
find in Lord Bolingbrokes book an infallible specific against that
epidemical complaintIt is important to remember that at this time
Lord Bolingbrokes philosophical works had not appeared which accounts
for Lord Chesterfields recommending to his son in this as well as in
some foregoing passages the study of Lord Bolingbrokes writings
I remember a gentleman who had read history in this thoughtless and
undistinguishing manner and who having traveled had gone through the
Valtelline He told me that it was a miserable poor country and
therefore it was surely a great error in Cardinal Richelieu to make
such a rout and put France to so much expense about it Had my friend
read history as he ought to have done he would have known that the great
object of that great minister was to reduce the power of the House of
Austria and in order to that to cut off as much as he could the
communication between the several parts of their then extensive
dominions which reflections would have justified the Cardinal to him in
the affair of the Valtelline But it was easier to him to remember facts
than to combine and reflect
One observation I hope you will make in reading history for it is an
obvious and a true one It is that more people have made great figures
and great fortunes in courts by their exterior accomplishments than by
their interior qualifications Their engaging address the politeness of
their manners their air their turn hath almost always paved the way
for their superior abilities if they have such to exert themselves
They have been favorites before they have been ministers In courts an
universal gentleness and douceur dans les manieres is most absolutely
necessary an offended fool or a slighted valet de chambre may very
possibly do you more hurt at court than ten men of merit can do you
good Fools and low people are always jealous of their dignity and
never forget nor forgive what they reckon a slight on the other hand
they take civility and a little attention as a favor remember and
acknowledge it this in my mind is buying them cheap and therefore
they are worth buying The prince himself who is rarely the shining
genius of his court esteems you only by hearsay but likes you by his
senses that is from your air your politeness and your manner of
addressing him of which alone he is a judge There is a court garment
as well as a wedding garment without which you will not be received
That garment is the volto sciolto an imposing air an elegant
politeness easy and engaging manners universal attention an
insinuating gentleness and all those je ne sais quoi that compose the
GRACES
I am this moment disagreeably interrupted by a letter not from you as I
expected but from a friend of yours at Paris who informs me that you
have a fever which confines you at home Since you have a fever I am
glad you have prudence enough in it to stay at home and take care of
yourself a little more prudence might probably have prevented it Your
blood is young and consequently hot and you naturally make a great deal
by your good stomach and good digestion you should therefore
necessarily attenuate and cool it from time to time by gentle purges
or by a very low diet for two or three days together if you would avoid
fevers Lord Bacon who was a very great physician in both senses of the
word hath this aphorism in his Essay upon Health Nihil magis ad
Sanitatem tribuit quam crebrae et domesticae purgationes By
domesticae he means those simple uncompounded purgatives which
everybody can administer to themselves such as sennatea stewed prunes
and senria chewing a little rhubarb or dissolving an ounce and a half
of manna in fair water with the juice of a lemon to make it palatable
Such gentle and unconfining evacuations would certainly prevent those
feverish attacks to which everybody at your age is subject
By the way I do desire and insist that whenever from any
indisposition you are not able to write to me upon the fixed days that
Christian shall and give me a TRUE account how you are I do not expect
from him the Ciceronian epistolary style but I will content myself with
the Swiss simplicity and truth
I hope you extend your acquaintance at Paris and frequent variety of
companies the only way of knowing the world every set of company
differs in some particulars from another and a man of business must in
the course of his life have to do with all sorts It is a very great
advantage to know the languages of the several countries one travels in
and different companies may in some degree be considered as different
countries each hath its distinctive language customs and manners know
