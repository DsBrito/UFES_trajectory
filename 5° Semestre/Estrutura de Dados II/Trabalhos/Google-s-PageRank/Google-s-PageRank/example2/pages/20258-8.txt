nothing could ever comfort her again
O Silky she moaned if you only knew you would be so sorry for me
The faithful dog knew that something very serious was the matter with
his young mistress but he could only lick her hands and wag his tail as
well as he was able with her weight upon his body
A fresh burst of grief shook the girl and Silky puzzled by this
unusual behaviour on Marjorys part began to make little low whines
himself Suddenly the whines were changed to growls the dog shook
himself free from the girls clasping arms and stood erect staring into
the wood beyond
Marjory was too much overcome by her grief to notice Silkys doings and
it was not until she heard a voice quite close to her saying You poor
little thing what is the matter that she realized that she was not
alone
She looked up startled wondering who this stranger could be making
free of her uncles woods She saw a lady tall and fair looking kindly
at her and a girl who might have stepped out of a picture so sweet and
fresh and pretty she looked in her white frock and shady hat
For one minute Marjory gazed at her in admiration and then conscious
of her tearstained face and tumbled dress let her head droop again and
sobbed afresh
The lady spoke again My dear child what is wrong
Nothing sobbed Marjorynothing that I can tell you
She felt ashamed of being seen in such a plight and had an instinctive
dislike of showing her feelings to a stranger for Marjory was an
extremely shy girl
But my dear remonstrated the lady I cannot leave you like this
besides with a smile most winning if only Marjory could have seen it
I believe you are trespassing upon our newlyacquired property
Marjory raised her head at this and said quickly and perhaps just a
little proudly
Oh no Im not this is my uncles ground
Oh dear then Blanche and I are the trespassers though quite innocent
ones And you must be Marjory Davidson I thinkDr Hunters niece and
if so I know a great deal about you and we are going to be friends
and you must let me begin by helping you now
So saying the lady seated herself on the ground beside Marjory her
daughter looking on at the same time stroking and patting Silky who
seemed much more disposed to be friendly than his mistress
Cant you tell me what the trouble is Marjory I am Mrs Forester and
this is my daughter Blanche We have just come to live at Braeside Your
uncle called on us today and told us about you Blanche and I have
been looking forward to seeing you and making friendsHavent we
Blanche
Yes Ive thought of nothing else since I heard about you said the
girl rather shyly the colour coming into her face as she spoke
Marjory stole another glance at her and she thought she had never seen
or imagined any one so sweet and pretty as this girl
Blanche she thoughtthat means white I know it from the names of
roses and hyacinths Ive seen it on the labels And she is just like
her namelike a beautiful white rose with the tiniest bit of pink in
it
Come now Marjory dear coaxed Mrs Forester wont you take us for
friends and tell me a little about this trouble of yours Wont you let
me try to help you out of it
No you cant help me nobody can Its very kind of you stammered
Marjory but its no use
Suppose you tell me and let me judge whether I can help you or not
And Mrs Forester took hold of one of Marjorys little brown hands and
stroked it gently
The soft touch and the gentle voice won Marjorys heart at last and she
said brokenly between her sobs
Its aboutlearning thingsand going to schooland unclewont let
me andand he wont tell me about my father and I dont belong to
anybody
Poor child poor little one dont cry so Try to tell me all about it
I dont quite understand but I am sure I shall be able to help you
Bit by bit the story came out The poor little heart unburdened itself
to sympathetic ears and the girl could hardly believe that it was
sheMarjory Davidsonwho was talking like this to a stranger She felt
for the first time in her life the relief of confiding in some one who
really understands and she experienced the comfort that sympathy can
give She felt as though she were dreaming and that this gentle woman
whose touch was so loving and whose voice was so tender might be the
mother whom alas she had never seen but in her dreams
Marjorys mother had died when her baby was only a few days old and all
that the child had ever been told about her father was that he was away
in foreign parts at the time of her mothers death and that he had
never been seen or heard of since Many and many a time did she think of
this unknown father Was he still alive Did he never give a thought to
his little girl Would he ever come home to see her
The true story was this Dr Hunter had been devotedly fond of his
sister Marjorythe only one amongst several brothers and sisters who
had lived to grow up Many years younger than himself she had been more
like a daughter to him than a sister On the death of their parents he
had been left her sole guardian and she had lived with him and been the
light and joy of his home The doctor might seem hard and cold to
outsiders wrapped up in his scientific studies and pursuits giving
little thought or care to any other affairs but he had an intense
capacity for loving and he lavished his affection upon his young
sister leaving nothing undone that might increase her happiness or her
comfort
All went well until she married Hugh Davidson handsome careless and
of a roving disposition as the doctor pronounced him to be They loved
each other and the doctor had to take the second place
Mr and Mrs Davidson made their home in England for a few months after
their marriage then he received an imperative summons from the other
side of the world requiring his presence He was needed to look after
some mining property in the far away NorthWest in the interests of a
company to which he belonged He bade a hurried farewell to his wife
promising to be back in six months She went home to her brother at
Hunters Brae and lived with him until her death She never recovered
from the shock of the parting Her husbands letters were of necessity
few and far between She had no idea of the difficulties and hardships
of his life and although she defended his long silences when the doctor
made comment upon them still she felt it was very hard that he should
write so seldom and when he did write that the letters should be so
short Could she have seen him struggling through an icebound country
enduring hardships and even privations such as are unknown to the
traveller of today could she have seen all this she could never have
blamed him she could only have praised him for his faithful service to
those who had sent him and the cheerful tone of his letters to her
with no word of personal complaint
But Mrs Davidson slowly lost her strength She faded away as a
beautiful fragile lily might and Hunters Brae was once more left
desolateyet not quite desolate for there was the baby girl and
thinking of her the doctor resolved that she should take her mothers
place with him He would devote himself to her he would try to avoid
all the mistakes he had made with his sister and above all her father
should not even know of her existence He would keep her all to himself
she should know no other care but his and thus her whole affection
should be his alone
It must be owned that jealousy had blinded Dr Hunter to his
brotherinlaws good qualities He had never troubled to inquire into
the circumstances of his going abroad Enough for him that the man had
left his wife alone only a few months after their marriage and he
obstinately refused to hear one word in his defence and would believe
no good of him He was quite honest in his desire to do the best that
was possible for the child and in the feeling that it would be better
to keep all knowledge of her father from her He looked upon Hugh
Davidson as a black sheep A black sheep could do no good to any one
therefore he argued he should not come near this precious child
Acting upon this determination he wrote a very curt note to Mr
Davidson acquainting him with the fact of his wifes death and telling
him that it was entirely his faultthat he had practically killed her
by leaving her alonebut making no mention of the child
Poor Mr Davidson received this letter just at a time when he dared to
hope that his work was nearly done and he could allow himself to think
of going home and his grief was pitiable He had no near relatives
having been the only child of his parents who had been dead many years
His wandering life had cut him adrift from the acquaintances and
surroundings of his youth He and his wife had lived in a world of their
own during those few short months and she had been his only
correspondent in the old country when he left it Thus it came about
that there was no one to give him the information which Dr Hunter
withheld and the poor man thinking himself alone in the world with no
ties no friends never had the heart to return home to the scenes of
his former happiness and thus it was that he never knew never thought
of his little girl growing up in that remote Scottish home lonely like
himself longing for and dreaming of things that seemed beyond her
reach
In the first weeks after his sisters death Dr Hunter derived much
consolation from the thought of the child He had named her Marjory
after her mother and took it for granted that she would be just such
another Marjoryfairhaired and blueeyedand he pictured her growing
up gentle and quiet as her mother had been Certainly the infants
eyes were blue at first and there was no hair to be seen on her head to
trouble the doctors visions by its unexpected colour but slowly and
surely it showed itself darkblack as nightcrisp and curly like her
fathers The eyes deepened and deepened till they too were dark
liquid and shining with a look of appeal in them even in those early
days
To say that Dr Hunter was disappointed would be a most inadequate
description of his feelings He was dismayed at first when he realized
the total reversal of his expectations and finally enraged to think
that this living image of the man he disliked and whom his conscience
at times would insist he had wronged would be constantly before him to
remind him of things he would prefer to forget
But these feelings passed and the child soon found her way into her
uncles heartthe heart that was really so big and so loving though
the way to it might be hard and rough The little toddling child knew no
fear of her stern old uncle it was only as she grew up that shyness
restraint and awkwardness in his presence took possession of Marjory
Dr Hunter had looked after her education himself She had been a
delicate little child and he had not troubled about any lessons in the
ordinary sense of the word for some years He wished her body to grow
strong first so she had spent her days in the garden on the hills or
on the lake with him she had learned the ways of birds and flowers and
animals and meanwhile had grown sturdy and healthy Her uncle had not
allowed her to make friends with any of the children in the
neighbourhood he himself was intimate with none of his neighbours
except the minister Mr Mackenzie and the doctor Dr Morison The
minister had no children and the doctors two boys were at school so
that Marjory only saw them occasionally in the holidays She had no
playmates of her own age and the children of the village looked upon
her as an alien amongst them regarding her almost with dislike
although it was not her fault that she was obliged to hold aloof from
them
Dr Hunter had a theory that his sister had been too dreamy and
romantic that he had petted her and given in to her too much instead
of insisting upon her learning to be more practical He blamed the fairy
tales of her childhood the influence of her school companions the
poetry and novels of later years as the chief causes of what he called
her dreamy ways and romantic nonsense and he determined that Marjory
should be very differently brought up She must learn to cook and to sew
and to be useful in the house She should not be allowed to read fairy
tales or poetry nor should she be sent to school he himself would
teach her what it was necessary for her to learn he would be very
careful before allowing her to make any friendships and with all these
precautionary measures he felt that she must grow into a good strong
sensible capable girl
So Lisbeth the housekeeper was ordered to teach the child to dust and to
sew and other useful things and Peter her husband must teach her to
hoe and to rake to sow seeds in her little garden and keep it tidy The
doctors own part in the programme was to teach her to read and write
and cast up figures That would be enough he considered for the
present Music languages and poetry were to be left out as being
likely to lead to romantic ideas and dreams and unrealities Time
enough for them when she is older he decided When the foundation of
commonsense has been laid there will be no danger Till then I shall
keep her to facts and nothing else
The doctor did his best to carry out these plans which he honestly
believed to be for the childs good in every possible way Lisbeth and
Peter grown old in service at Hunters Brae were warned on no account
to talk to Marjory about her father or old times or to encourage her in
doing so and they tried hard to do as their master bade them though it
was difficult sometimes to resist those pleading eyes when the child
would say Wont you tell me about my father Lisbeth dear or Peter
darling as the case might be Peter was a gardener and
manofallwork and his hands were sometimes very dirty but he was a
darling all the same to Marjory and indeed he was a good old man If he
and his wife had known the truth that Mr Davidson had never been told
about his child it is likely that Peters strict sense of justice would
have prompted him to right that wrong But like every one else he took
it for granted that the news had gone to Mr Davidson and in his kind
old heart was often tempted to blame the seemingly careless father
Could he but see the bonnie lamb he would say sometimes to his wife
the vera picter o himsel he wouldna hae the heart to leave her Ive
wondered whiles if the doctor wouldna send him a bit photograph just to
show him what like she is
Lisbeth would reply Peter its just nae manner o use thinkin o ony
sic a thing The doctor hes that set against Mr Davidson that ye micht
as weel try to move Ben Lomond itsel as to move him
These conversations usually ended in an admonition from Lisbeth to Peter
to eat his meat and no blether The suggestion was never made to the
doctor no word ever reached Mr Davidson and things went on much in
the same way year after year and although at times the doctor would
question the efficacy of his plans for Marjorys education on the
whole he was fairly satisfied with them
The day on which this story opens had seen the doctor take a most
unusual step Hearing from an old acquaintance in Londona scientific
man and student like himself whose opinion he considered worth
somethingthat some friends of his had bought Braeside the property
adjoining Hunters Brae he determined to do his duty as a neighbour
and go to welcome the newcomers as soon as they arrived His friend had
written Mrs Forester is a most charming woman Forester himself a
thoroughly good fellow and their little girl Blanche one of the
sweetest children I have ever seen She will make a good companion for
your niece poor little thing
This letter had set the doctor thinking First he was nettled by his
friends use of the words poor little thing Why should Marjory be
pitied as a poor little thing Had he not done everything he possibly
could for her Then came one of those painful stabs of conscience which
insisted now and then on being felt What about her father Have you
done right in that matter
He salved his conscience for the time being by making up his mind to go
and see the Foresters and if they were indeed all that his friend had
said there could be no reason why he should not encourage a friendship
between the two girls Marjory certainly had been very quiet and
inclined to mope of late and it would be a good thing for her to be
roused by this new interest The child was seldom out of his thoughts
for long together he loved her as his own and yet Marjory was not
happyshe was lonely she did not understand her uncle and misjudged
him and he found her cold and unresponsive There was something wanting
between them both were conscious of this want yet neither knew how to
supply it and so mend matters
CHAPTER II
A FRIEND IN NEED
Have hope though clouds environ now
And gladness hides her face in scorn
Put thou the shadow from thy brow
No night but has its mornSCHILLER
Things had come to a climax that afternoon Marjory had driven by
herself to the village to get some things that Lisbeth wanted and also
to buy some stamps for her uncle Peter usually accompanied her on these
expeditions but today he was busy in the vinehouse and excused
himself from attending upon his little mistress She was quite
accustomed to driving however and Brownie the pony was a very
steady wellbehaved little animal and a great pet of Marjorys so she
started off in good spirits Silky running beside the cart as usual She
did her errands in the village finishing up at the post office which
was also the bakery and the most important building in the place Mrs
Smylie the bakers wife and postmistress served her with the stamps
and Marjory was about to say goodafternoon and leave the shop when
Mrs Smylie opened a door and called out
Mary Ann heres Hunters Marjory maybe yed like to see her And
turning to Marjory she explained Mary Anns just hame frae the schule
for a wee bit
The Smylies were the most important people in the village of
Heathermuir Their mills supplied the countryside with flour and their
bakery was the only one of any size in the district They had built
their own house it had a garden attached to it and a greenhouse and
to crown all their only child Mary Ann was to be brought up as a lady
With this object in view the ambitious parents had sent the girl to a
Seminary for Young Ladies at Morristown some twenty miles away and
were greatly pleased with the result feeling that Mary Ann was really
quite a lady That young person was delighted to come home and be
worshipped by her admiring parents and their idea that a real lady
should never soil her fingers by household work or indeed by work of
any kind suited her very well
Mrs Smylie bursting with pride as her daughter appeared watched the
meeting between the two girls Mary Anns dress was very much
overtrimmed her hair was frizzed into a spiky bush across her forehead
and her somewhat freckled face was composed into an expression of serene
selfcomplacency She was the only girl in the village who was at a
boardingschool not even Hunters Marjory with all her airs could
boast this advantage she thought and Mary Ann felt her superiority
and gloried in it
Mrs Smylie noted with great pride that the hand her daughter held out
to Marjory was white and delicatein great contrast to Marjorys brown
one But then she reflected the puir bairn hasna got her mither to
watch her like oor Mary Ann has Bless me how the lassie glowers Mary
Ann has the biggest share o manners onyways
It must be confessed that Marjory was glowering She regarded the
overdressed girl with aversion answered her mincinglyspoken How do
you do Marjory very curtly and continued to glower as Mrs Smylie
described it without saying another word
Wont you come into the house asked Mary Ann and Marjory went
She did not care about these people she had never liked Mary Ann and
could hardly bear to look at her now or listen to her affected way of
talking Still she did not wish to be rude so she followed Mary Ann
through the shop into the house and was ushered into the sittingroom
or parlour as it was called The room was like Mary Anns dressfull of
all sorts of bright colours and gaudy ornaments of poor quality
There was one thing about Mary Ann which interested Marjory profoundly
and that was her school experience She felt that she would like to
question the girl about it and yet was too proud to betray her
curiosity by bringing up the subject Mary Ann however saved her the
trouble for as soon as they were seated she began at once
Why dont your uncle send you to school Any one would think a great
girl like you ought to be sent to school Why dont he send you
Uncle doesnt wish me to go to school
Maybe he dont want to pay the fees said Mary Ann
Marjory said nothing
I learn French and German and music Im getting on fine with the
piano and papas going to buy me one of my own soon You havent got a
piano at Hunters Brae have you
No said Marjory shortly
As a matter of fact there was a piano at Hunters Brae but it was kept
in the room that had been her mothersa room that Marjory was not
allowed to enter For reasons of his own the doctor had forbidden
Marjory to go into it She should do so on her fifteenth birthday but
not before Lisbeth went in once a week with pail broom and duster
but she always carefully locked the door behind her and Marjory knew
nothing of the room or its contents Some bonnie day was all that the
old woman would say when she questioned her
Mary Ann continued
It seems a shame you cant be made a lady of too
I can be a lady without going to school said Marjory sulkily
The other looked at her in surprise
Oh no you cant Who is there to teach you You have to learn manners
and deportment and accomplishments and all that sort of thing first I
dont see that youve got any chance here you poor little thing
patronizingly
I dont care said Marjory knowing in her heart that she did care
beyond everything and that her greatest desire was to learn all sorts
of things I dont care a pin she repeated
Yes you do or you wouldnt get so red said Mary Ann provokingly
Then she continued Your uncles queer isnt he
What do you mean by queer
Wellqueerin his head you know People say he is and anyhow he
does queer thingskeeping that room shut up and all that I should say
he must be a little bit mad
He isnt indignantly Hes a very clever celebrated man
Mary Ann went off into peals of laughter
Oh dear who told you that she cried at last
Lisbeth defiantly
Another peal of laughter greeted this statement
It really is too funny you little simpleton to believe such a thing
Why if he was celebrated he would be rich enough to send you to
school and he wouldnt let you sew and dust the way you do just like
any village girl I never dust mamma doesnt wish me to And Mary
Ann looked at her white hands admiringly and shot a glance which
Marjory felt rather than saw at the brown ones nervously clasping and
unclasping themselves
I wonder continued her tormentor that you dont insist on being
sent to school so that you could learn to earn your own living Ive
heard mamma say your uncle gets no money for your keep no letters ever
come from foreign parts from your father It must be strange to have a
father youve never seen It must be horrid to be like you because
really when you come to think of it you are no better off than a
charity child are you
But Mary Ann had gone too far A tempest was raging in Marjorys heart
and as soon as she could find her voice which seemed suddenly to have
deserted her she cried
You are a beast Mary Ann Smylie and I hate you and although I
havent been to school I dont say if he was and dont instead of
doesnt And with this parting shot Marjory rushed through the shop and
jumped into the cart and Brownie infected by his mistresss
excitement galloped nearly all the way home his unusual haste and
Silkys sympathetic barking causing quite a commotion in the sleepy
quiet village
Arrived home Marjory ran to her uncles study knocked loudly at the
door and hardly waiting for permission went in leaving Silky
breathless and panting outside
The doctor was sitting in his armchair in his favourite attitudehis
legs crossed the tips of his fingers meeting his eyes fixed upon them
but his thoughts far away As a matter of fact he was thinking of
Marjory at this very moment of his visit to the Foresters and the
plans they had been making for the two girls
Well Marjory what is it he asked kindly as the excited girl stood
before him She was trembling with agitation her cheeks were scarlet
and her dark eyes flashed upon her uncle as she replied
I want you to send me to school I dont want to live on your charity
any longer I never knew I was till today with a sob then
piteously Wont you send me to school Uncle George
My dear child exclaimed the doctor what is all this Who has been
talking to you and putting such nonsense into your head looking at his
niece in astonishment
The quiet usually almost sullen girl was transformed into a passionate
little fury for the time being and her uncle hardly recognized her She
burst out again
Mary Ann Smylie looks down on me because I dont go to school She says
I cant ever be a lady and she says that you get no money for my keep
and that I am no better than a charity child I want to learn what other
girls learn I want you to send me to school and I want you to tell me
about my father and to let me go into my mothers room
The child almost screamed these last words and stamped upon the floor
to emphasize them
The doctor now thoroughly aroused rose from his chair saying very
sternly
Marjory I cannot alter my decision upon these matters I do not wish
you to go to school I refuse to tell you any more than you have already
been told about your father I have promised that you shall go into your
mothers room and take possession of it on your fifteenth birthday That
is enough I am grieved that you should have listened to vulgar gossip
about our affairs but I may tell you that your mother left money to
provide for you ten times over if need be
Then you are unkind and cruel not to use it to send me to school and
let me have what other girls have cried Marjory passionately
Marjory said her uncle quietly I cannot listen to you while you are
in this mood You had better go and come back again when you can talk
more reasonably
Yes I will go and I wish I need never come back I hate everything
and I wish I were dead
With these words she flung out of the room rushed blindly through the
house into the garden and on into the wood where she threw herself down
under a tree and sobbed out her grief to the faithful Silky until Mrs
Forester found her
Dr Hunter was very much troubled and puzzled by his nieces behaviour
Never before had she given way to such an outburst He had not believed
her capable of such a storm of passion and felt himself quite at a
loss He was grieved and shocked beyond measure by Marjorys words
Unkind cruel he muttered to himself Surely not I love the little
thing as though she were my own And while Marjory was weeping bitterly
under the tree in the wood her uncle very sorrowful and thoughtful
was pacing up and down his study wondering what he could do for the
best It seemed all the more grievous as only that afternoon he had
been making plans for Marjory with Mrs Foresterthat she should share
Blanches lessons and enjoy her companionship
Mrs Forester had heard much of the doctor and his niece from the mutual
friend in London who had written to the doctor and she knew exactly how
to manage things so that in the course of one short hour plans were
made which were to alter Marjorys whole existence
But she poor child knew nothing of this and her grief was bitterthe
more so as she slowly realized that she had been wrong to give way to
her passion First she had called Mary Ann Smylie a beast Well she
had been very much shocked once to hear a child in the street use that
word to another but she herself had used it quite easily and still
felt as if she would like to use it again but worst of all she had
called her uncle unkind and cruel Thinking over the scene in the study
she remembered the look on his face as she said these words It was as
if I had struck him she thought and then came more tears and sobs
Mrs Foresters motherly heart yearned over the girl as she made her
confession Brokenly and with many tears the story was told and relief
came to Marjory in the telling of it Blanche with instinctive tact
had walked away a little distance with Silky so that Marjory should
feel free to talk to her mother When the recital was over Mrs
Forester said cheerfully I told you I thought I should be able to help
you First of all I have got some delightful news for you Only today
your uncle and I have been making plans for you to share in Blanches
lessons You are to learn everything that she does including French
and music with a smile at the recollection of her battle against the
doctors prejudices
A breathless oh was all that Marjory could say
Mrs Forester continued
Blanche has a very good kind governess Unfortunately she has rather
an ugly name and it may make you smile It is WaspeW a s p
enot pretty is it But she is as sweet as she can be and very
accomplished and Blanche gets on nicely with her It will be much more
interesting for Blanche to have some one to share her lessons with and
good for you too wont it
Oh indeed it will replied Marjory bewildered by this wonderful
piece of news
And in return for this I want you to teach Blanche all you can
I asked Marjory in surprise
Yes you with a smile at the girls puzzled expression Blanche is a
little too much like her name at present she isnt very strong Living
in London didnt suit her and it is for her sake that we have come to
live here I want you to show her all your favourite nooks and corners
to teach her all you know about the birds and flowers and to let her
help you in your garden Will you do this and keep her out of doors as
much as you can
I shall love it cried Marjory emphatically Its like a dream and
seems too good to be true
Now my child continued Mrs Forester seriously listen to me I
think you have been doing your uncle a great injustice You say you
called him unkind and cruel he is neither the one nor the other
I know replied Marjory in a low voice
He is very fond of you said Mrs Forester
