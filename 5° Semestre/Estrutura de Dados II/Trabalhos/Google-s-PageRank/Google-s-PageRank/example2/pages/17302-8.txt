of concrete walls 1320000 lb of structural steel 638000 ft BM of
framed timber etc etc
This contract was divided into two parts Work In and Under Ninth Avenue
and Work Between Ninth and Tenth Avenues and unit prices were quoted for
the various classes of work in each of these divisions The prices quoted
for excavation included placing the material on scows supplied by the
Railroad Company at the pier at the foot of West 32d Street on the North
River there was a clause in the contract however by which the contractor
could be required to make complete disposal of all excavated material at an
additional unit price and this clause was enforced on January 1st 1909
when about 94 of the excavation had been done
For the purpose of disposing of the excavated material in the easterly
portion of the Terminal the New York Contracting CompanyPennsylvania
Terminal had excavated under Ninth Avenue a cut which came to the grade of
32d Street about midway between Ninth and Tenth Avenues and a trestle was
constructed from this point over Tenth Avenue and thence to the disposal
pier at the foot of West 32d Street
On May 11th 1906 the work of excavation was commenced on the east side of
Ninth Avenue and on July 9th 1906 on the south side of 31st Street
between Ninth and Tenth Avenues From the beginning the excavation was
carried on by day and night shifts except on Sundays and holidays until
January 1909 except that during the period from November 1907 to
October 1908 the night shift was discontinued
GeologyThe rock encountered may be classed as gneiss its character
varied from granite to mica schist It was made up of quartz feldspar and
mica and there were also some isolated specimens of pyrites hornblend
tourmaline and serpentine On the south side of the work just west of
Ninth Avenue there were excellent examples of contortions of veins of
quartz in the darker rock On the east side of Ninth Avenue near the north
end of the work glacial marks were found on the rock surface The general
direction of the stratification was north 5 west and the general incline
about 60 with the horizontal As a rule the rock broke sharply along the
line of stratification On the south side it broke better than on the north
side where it was usually softer and more likely to slide and this
together with the fact that in winter it was subject to alternate freezing
and thawing and in summer to the direct rays of the sun made it rather
difficult to get a good foundation for the retaining walls
WORK IN AND UNDER NINTH AVENUE
General DescriptionThe work involved the excavation of about 375 ft
of the full width of Ninth Avenue to an average depth of about 58 ft and
the construction over this area of a steel viaduct the deck of which was
about 24 ft below the surface for the ultimate support of the Ninth
Avenue structures
The following estimated quantities appear in the contract Excavation of
rock 72600 cu yd excavation of all materials except rock 9300 cu
yd concrete 136 in abutments etc 1680 cu yd timber 504000
ft BM structural steel 1320000 lb etc
While this excavation was being done it was necessary to support and
maintain the threetrack elevated railway structure of the Interborough
Rapid Transit Company of which 18 columns or a length of about 340 ft
were affected the twotrack surface railway structure of the New York City
Railway Company and various pipes sewers and conduits and to maintain
all surface vehicular and pedestrian traffic All structures were left in
place with the exception of the pipes most of which were temporarily cut
out The 48in brick sewer in the center of Ninth Avenue was broken and
the sewage was pumped across the excavation through a smaller pipe
The general method adopted was as follows The east and west sides of the
avenue were closed vehicular traffic was turned into the center and a
trestle for pedestrians was constructed west of the westerly elevated
railway columns All structures were then supported on transverse girders
running across the avenue below the surface and these rested on concrete
piers on the central rock core The sides of the avenue were then excavated
to subgrade and the permanent steel viaduct was erected on both sides of
the avenue as close as possible to the central rock core The weight of all
structures was then transferred to the permanent steel viaduct erected on
the sides of the avenue by timber bents under the transverse girders
resting on the permanent steel viaduct and all weight was thus taken off
the central rock core This core was then excavated to subgrade the
permanent viaduct was completed and all structures were placed on its
deck using concrete piers and timber bents
The design and erection of the permanent steel viaduct and the permanent
foundations on its deck were done under another contract apart from the
North River Division work and are not described in this paper
Elevated Railway Structure of the Interborough Rapid Transit
CompanyThe Ninth Avenue Elevated Railway was built between 1877 and
1880 as a twotrack structure the design being such as to permit a third
or central track to be added later and this was built in 1894 It is
supported on columns under the outside tracks about 43 ft from center to
center longitudinally and 22 ft 3 in from center to center transversely
the central track being carried by transverse girders between the columns
The columns carrying the structure are of fan top design with the points
of bearing near the extremities at the top each of the outside tracks is
supported on two longitudinal latticed girders and the central track on
two plate girders between the columns transverse girders are spliced to
the outside track crossframes and carry the central track system It was
not thought desirable to put brackets on the columns near the street level
to support the structure temporarily and as there is an expansion joint
at each column and as the transverse girders carrying the central track
system are not rigidly attached to the longitudinal girders carrying the
outside tracks the central track could not be supported by supporting the
outside tracks therefore independent supports for each track in the form
of overhead girders had to be provided The columns rest on brick piers
each having four 2in anchorbolts The brick foundations on the west side
are wide in order to allow a 24in water main to pass directly beneath the
columns The foundations are usually on rock

The east track is used for northbound local trains the west track for
southbound local trains and the central track for southbound express
trains between 7 and 930 AM and for northbound express trains between
230 and 7 PM It is said that an average of 90000 passengers are carried
over this structure every 24 hours
Surface Railway Structure of the New York City Railway CompanyThis is
an electric surface railway of the ordinary type the rail and slot being
bedded in concrete with castiron yokes every 5 ft There are manholes
every 100 ft and cleaningout holes every 15 ft Power conduits are
bedded in the concrete on the east side of the east track
FortyeightInch Brick SewerThis sewer was in the center of Ninth
Avenue with the invert about 12 ft below the surface and manholes about
100 ft apart and had to be abandoned in this position to allow the
transverse girders to be put in place to carry all structures while the
excavation was being done
TwentyfourInch CastIron Water MainThis water main was laid under
the west elevated railway columns with its top about 3 ft below the
surface a space being left for it in the brick foundations and a large
column base casting being used to span it Valves were installed one north
of 33d Street and one south of 31st Street prior to excavating near the
pipe so that if it was broken the water could be shut off promptly
Street SurfaceIt was the original intention to close and excavate the
east side of the avenue and to erect there a streettraffic trestle before
closing the west side but at the contractors request both sides were
closed and all vehicular traffic was turned into the center A light
trestle on the west side of the avenue provided for pedestrian traffic
Other Subsurface StructuresThere were various gas mains water mains
electric conduits manholes hydrants etc in the avenue and most of
these were cut out temporarily at the contractors request to be replaced
subsequently
Supports for Elevated Railway StructureAs stated previously the
central track had to be supported independently
The overhead girders known as girders B were therefore designed as
shown on Fig 1 and put in place as shown on Figs 2 and 3 The outside
tracks were blocked directly on these girders and the central track was
supported by blocking up the transverse girders on Ibeams placed between
the girders B and no blocking was placed between the girders B and the
longitudinal girders carrying the central track The weight on each column
was assumed to be 172000 lb

DETAILS OF STEEL GIRDERS ETC SUPPORTING NINTH AVENUE STRUCTURES
Supports for Surface Railway StructureA uniform load of 3000 lb per
lin ft of single track with the weight of a car at 39000 lb was
assumed Several feet of earth between the structure and the rock were
mined out and the structure was supported on Ibeams and posts and
ultimately on the transverse girders by using timber bents under the
Ibeams as shown on Fig 3
Water Mains and SewerCradles were designed for the support of the
48in and 24in water mains resting on the transverse girders and the
48in castiron sewer on the east side of the avenue was carried on
Ibeams bracketed to the ends of the transverse girders as shown on Figs
1 and 2

Girders CThe transverse girders below the street surface referred
to above were known as girders C and they were put in place at first
resting on concrete piers on the central core the weight of all structures
was placed on them while the sides of the avenue were being excavated and
the sides of the viaduct were being built The ends of these girders were
then picked up on the sides of the viaduct and spanning the central rock
core carried all structures while the core was being excavated and the
viaduct completed New foundations were then placed on the deck of the
viaduct to carry all structures
Fiftyfour of these girders were required each weighing about 19000 lb
The bents carrying the ends of these girders on the sides of the viaduct
are shown on Fig 2 They were of longleaf yellow pine These girders were
located so that a cradle could be laid on them east of the elevated railway
structure to carry a proposed 48in castiron water main
Girders BEighteen of these girders were required each weighing
about 6000 lb The timber bents supporting these girders shown on Fig 2
were of longleaf yellow pine
The total weight including the elevated railway structure surface railway
structure pipes etc supported during the work amounted to about 5000
tons
Details of the WorkThe method in general is shown on Figs 4 and 5 At
first the east side of the avenue was closed and excavated down to rock
the earth was mined out under alternate yokes of the surface railway
structure and temporary posts were placed under the yokes to support the
structure while the remainder of the earth was being removed Then
needlebeams and posts were placed under each yoke The concrete forming
the track structure was then enclosed with planking to prevent it from
cracking and falling Ibeams were then placed under the needlebeams
carrying the structures and these were carried on posts they were changed
alternately until the excavation had been taken out to a depth of about 16
ft below the surface In placing these Ibeams heavier blocking was used
in the center of the span than at the ends where the bents would come to
prevent the subsidence of the track owing to the sag in the Ibeams As
much excavation to a depth of about 20 ft was taken out adjoining the
elevated railway foundations as could be done with safety Fig 2 Plate
XLVII shows this condition of the work The 48in brick sewer was broken
and the sewage was pumped across the excavation
The overhead girders B were then put in place and two of the girders C
were used as temporary shoring girders at each column These as shown by
Fig 3 Plate XLVII were placed parallel to the elevated railway with
blocking between them and the girders B Double bents independent
of each other were placed under the ends of these temporary shoring
girders and these were braced securely to prevent possible dislodgment
during the removal of the rock The weight of the structure was then taken
by jacking up the girders near the bents until the column was lifted off
the old foundation blocking was put in between the girders and the bents
during the jacking so that when the jacks were released the base of the
column was still clear of the old foundation One 80ton jack was used for
this purpose and the general method is shown by Fig 1 Plate LII

Excavation Completed
Temporary raker braces were placed against the structure to prevent lateral
movement Four sets of these temporary shoring girders were used in this
manner two sets starting at the north end and two sets at about the middle
of the work and these sets were moved south as they were released
The columns being thus supported on temporary shoring girders the old
foundations were removed and the excavation was taken down to a level about
16 ft below the surface
Two sets of three of the girders C were then put in place under the
avenue at each column each set being placed on four concrete piers 6 ft
square with spaces of 4 ft between them so that the outside of the
outside pier would be 18 ft from the center of the avenue and 32 ft from
the house line This is shown on Fig 5 and on Fig 3 Plate XLVII Four
small piers were used as they could be more easily removed than one
continuous pier The girders C were set to line and grade and the piers
were built under them great care being taken to get the concrete well
under the girders so as to give a firm bearing
After these girders C were in place it was necessary to remove the
temporary shoring girders before the bents could be erected on girders C
to support girders B being in the same plane and provision had to be
made to support the structure while this was being done Therefore double
bents were erected directly beneath the columns as shown by Figs 2 4
and 5 and by Fig 3 Plate XLVII These were built with their sills
resting on the girders C and blocking was put in between the sills and
the rock to carry the full weight of the structure Later when the weight
of the structure was carried on the permanent bents this blocking was
knocked out but the bents were left in to carry the weight of the column
itself which was swinging more or less from the structure above The
weight of the structure was placed on these bents directly beneath the
columns by jacking up the temporary girders again putting blocking between
the bents and the base of the columns and taking out the blocking which
had been put in previously under the temporary shoring girders The 24in
water main was carried over the excavation on cables from the temporary
shoring girders except when they were being jacked up at which time posts
were placed beneath it
Anchorbolts were put in place between the column bases and the bents
directly beneath in order to increase the lateral stiffness and raker
braces were also used This having been done the temporary shoring girders
were moved south to the next column where the process was repeated The
timber bents shown in detail by Fig 2 were then put in place as shown by
Figs 4 and 5 and by Fig 3 Plate XLVII These bents were framed as
tightly as possible using generally a 20ton jack and they were erected
simultaneously at each pair of columns The weight was taken on these
columns by jacking up directly beneath the column base and taking out the
blocking between this base and the bent directly beneath the column On
releasing the jack the weight was transferred to the permanent timber
bents and the east and west columns of each pair were transferred on the
same day One 80ton jack was used on the easterly columns and two were
necessary on the westerly columns one on each side of the 24in water
main The raker braces of these permanent bents were not framed as tightly
as the main posts in order that the main post should carry the entire
weight and the raker braces merely steady the structure
Timber bents were erected on girders C to carry the Ibeams under the
surface railway structure as shown on Fig 3 and all temporary posts
under these Ibeams were removed The bents were framed with a jack as
tightly as possible and very little settlement of the track occurred
A cradle was then built under the 24in water main and placed on girders
C and as a temporary footwalk had been constructed on the west side of
the avenue it will be seen that all structures were thus carried on
girders C
All structures were put on the girders C before continuing the excavation
on the sides of the avenue because in case of a slide of rock there would
be less danger than to individual structures The outside piers on
which the girders C rested might even be lost without affecting the
stability of the structure and posting could readily be done beneath these
girders in case of necessity
A very careful record of levels taken on the elevated railway columns was
kept observations being made during each jacking up and at least twice a
week during the progress of the work The columns were usually kept about
12 in high so as to allow for compression in the timber bents
As a rule no jacking of the elevated railway structure was done while
trains were passing over and trains were flagged during the operation
There was generally very little delay as all jacking was done between
1030 AM and 230 PM when the traffic was lightest and frequently the
jacking was done between trains causing no delay whatever Steel clamps
were placed three on the top and three on the bottom of each set of the
girders C to bind them together and cause them to act as a unit
All structures then being supported on girders C which were carried on
four concrete piers resting on the central rock core the excavation on the
sides of the avenue was continued down to subgrade and the east and west
portions of the concrete north abutment were constructed The central rock
core was about 36 ft wide on the top and 45 ft wide on the bottom and at
the center of 32d Street it was about 42 ft high
It was the original intention to excavate a sufficient width of the sides
of the avenue to erect six rows of the permanent steel viaduct 5 ft from
center to center and this was done on the south portion of the work On
the north portion however the rock was of poor quality and it was
thought best to excavate for only five rows at first to erect the five
rows of permanent steel and put the timber bents in place under the ends of
the girders C in order to give them some support while the outside
concrete piers were being removed and the excavation was being widened out
to permit the erection of the sixth row Additional raker braces were put
in these bents temporarily and were removed when the sixth row of steel
had been erected This is shown on Figs 4 and 5

The excavation of the sides of the avenue having been completed and six

shown on Figs 2 4 5 and 6 were erected on this steel to support the
ends of the girders C and carry the structure while the rock core was
being excavated Fig 3 Plate XLVIII shows the method of taking the
weight on these bents Four 80ton jacks were used and oak blocks were
placed on the top of each jack to transmit pressure to a temporary oak cap
under the girders C independent of the bents all four of these jacks
were operated simultaneously and the girders C were lifted off the bents
and clear of the concrete piers Oak filling pieces were then inserted
between the bents and the girders C so that when the jacks were released
the girders C were clear of the concrete piers Fig 3 Plate XLVIII
shows that the girders have been lifted off the piers Elevations were
taken on each set of girders during each operation and careful
observations were made on the elevated railway columns Where the rock was
very close to these bents the open space between the posts was filled with
blocking so that there would be less danger of the bent shifting if struck
by blasted materials Fig 3 Plate XLVIII shows one of these bents filled
with blocking
All structures being carried on girders C which in turn were carried
on the sides of the permanent viaduct the central core was excavated Fig

GENERAL ARRANGEMENT OF TEMPORARY AND PERMANENT STRUCTURES
During the latter part of 1908 a 48in castiron water main was laid by
the city on a cradle built by the Railroad Company on girders C on the
east side of the avenue This is part of the highpressure system and the
location and elevation of this water main were taken into consideration
when the underpinning was designed This main and the 48in castiron
sewer bracketed to girders C are shown on Fig 4 Plate XLVIII
Elevations had been taken on marks on the elevated railway columns
between 30th and 34th Streets at the time the original surveys were made
in 1902 and these marks were used to test the level of the structure
during the progress of the excavation
At the extreme south end of the work the procedure was changed The east
side was excavated down to subgrade the east portion of the south
abutment was constructed and six rows of the permanent steel viaduct were
erected Very little excavation had been done on the west side of the
avenue at the south end of the work and it would have delayed the
completion of the work to have waited for the excavation for and the
construction of the west portion of the south abutment and the erection of
the steel therefore instead of supporting the girders C on the central
rock core the east ends were taken up on the permanent viaduct girders
and the west ends were supported on a concrete pier on the rock The
central portion of the avenue was excavated in advance of the west portion
The permanent viaduct girders were put in place from east to west across
the avenue and the girders C were supported on the deck of the permanent
viaduct approximately under the west elevated railway columns before the
west portion of the avenue was excavated the central portion of the south
abutment having been constructed before the west portion This procedure
was adopted only at the north girders C at elevated railway column No
488 the south set of girders C being on the rock immediately south of
the south abutment Figs 2 and 4 Plate XLIX and Fig 2 Plate LII show
various stages of the work at the south end

It was made a practice all through the work to transfer the weight of the
structures very positively from one support to another by lifting them
bodily by jacks and putting in filler pieces before releasing the jacks
not trusting to wedging to transfer the loads In fact apart from the
boxingin of the surface railway concrete no wedges whatever were used
This appears to have been a decided advantage for with the constant
pounding of trains on the elevated railway and the jarring due to heavy
trucks on the pavement blocks it is very likely that wedging would have
become loosened and displaced whereas with blocking there was little or
no tendency toward displacement due to vibration Although the vibration of
the structure when a long length was supported on girders C resting on
the permanent viaduct girders on the sides of the avenue appeared to be
considerable not only vertically but transversely very careful
observation showed that the sag in the girder C due a live load of three
elevated railway trains one surface railway car and one heavy truck
amounted to 18 in The sideway vibration did not amount to more than 132
in on either side of the normal position More vibration was caused by
heavy trucks and wagons going over the stone pavement than by the elevated
railway trains or surface cars
No blasting was done near the supports of the elevated railway structure
while trains were passing over it and occasionally trains were stopped
during a heavy or uncertain blast A watchman on the surface day and
night and at first one and later two flagmen on the elevated railway
structure were on duty at all times reporting to the Interborough Rapid
Transit Company by whom they were employed Log mats and timber protection
for the girders and the columns of the permanent viaduct were used as
shown by Figs 1 and 4 Plate XLIX during the excavation of the rock core
and timber was also used to protect the face of the completed portions of
the concrete abutments
In excavating the sides of the avenue the rock broke better on the east
than on the west side where large seams developed and some slides
occurred
AbutmentsAs shown on Fig 7 the face of the north abutment has a
batter of 2 in to the foot and the face of the south abutment has a
variable batter the base being on a grade and the bridge seat being level
and both maintaining a uniform distance from the center of the Terminal
Yard The back walls of the abutments were not built until the steel had
been put in place
No attempt was made to waterproof these abutments but in the rear of the
wall open spaces were left about 6 ft from center to center which were
connected with drain pipes at the base of and extending through the wall
for the purpose of carrying off any water that might develop in the rock
These drains were formed by building wooden boxes with the side toward the
rock open and the joints in the boxes and against the rock plastered with
mortar in advance of the wall A hose was used to run water through these
drains during the placing of the concrete for the purpose of washing out
any grout which might run into them Each box was washed out at frequent
intervals and there was no clogging of the drains whatever This method
of keeping the drains open was adopted and used successfully for the entire
work The abutments were built of concrete and the mixture was 1 part of
cement 3 parts of sand and 6 parts of broken stone
The concrete was mixed in a No 3 Ransome mixer and was placed very wet
No facing mixture or facing diaphragms were used but the stone was spaded
away from the face of the wall as the concrete was laid Chutes were used
inside the form if the concrete had to drop some distance Work was
continued day and night without any intermission from the time of
commencement to the time of completion of each section
The face of the concrete wall was rubbed and finished in a manner similar
to that used on the walls between Ninth and Tenth Avenues as described
later

abutment completed and carrying the permanent viaduct and the excavation

WORK BETWEEN NINTH AND TENTH AVENUES
General DescriptionThe work involved the excavation of about 54
acres between the west house line of Ninth Avenue and the east house line
of Tenth Avenue to an average depth of about 50 ft the construction of a
stone masonry portal at Tenth Avenue leading to the River Tunnels and the
construction around the site of the concrete retaining and face walls
