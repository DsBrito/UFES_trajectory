And a tiger shouted a young lieutenant in a bulllike voice
that was heard over the racket
Colonel Cleaves though he did not unbend much before the tumult
permitted a gleam of satisfaction to show itself in his fine
rugged features
Good he said quietly in a firm voice  I feel assured that
we shall all pull together for the common weal and for the abiding
glory of American arms
Gathering up the papers that he had during his speech laid out
on the table before him the colonel stepped briskly down the
central aisle of the messroom  As it was a confidential meeting
of regimental officers and no enlisted man was present one of
the second lieutenants succeeded in being first to reach the door
Throwing it open he came smartly to attention saluting as the
commanding officer passed through the doorway  Then the door
closed
Good cried Captain Dick Prescott  That was straight talk
all the way through
Hit the mark or leave the regiment voiced Captain Greg Holmes
enthusiastically
Be a one hundred per cent officer or get out of the service
agreed another comrade
The tumult had already died down  The officers from LieutenantColonel
Graves down to the newest shavetail or second lieutenant acted
as by common impulse when they pivoted slowly about on their heels
glancing at each other with earnest smiles
Gentlemen our job has been cut out for us  We know the price
of success and we know what failure would mean for us personally
or collectively  Going over to quarters Sands
Thrusting a hand through the arm of Major Sands LieutenantColonel
Graves started down the aisle  Little groups followed and the
messroom of that company barracks was speedily emptied
Hard work not age had brought the gray frosting into the hair
of Colonel Cleaves he was fortyseven years old and not many
months before he had been only a major
The time was early in September in the year 1917  War had been
declared against Germany on April 6th  In the middle of July
the Ninetyoninth Infantry had been called into existence  Regiments
were then being added to the Regular Army  Two or three hundred
trained soldiers and several hundred recruits had made up the
beginnings of the regiment  Prescott and Holmes had been among
the latest of the captains sent to the regiment arriving in August
And now Colonel Cleaves had just joined his command on orders
from Washington
With forty men in the headquarters company and some fifty in the
machinegun company the rifle companies on this September day
averaged about seventy men  Nor had a full complement of officers
yet arrived
Dick Prescott and Greg Holmes lately first lieutenants as readers
of former volumes of this series are aware had received their
commissions as captains just before joining the Ninetyninth
This regiment is scheduled to go over at an early date Colonel
Cleaves had informed his regimental officers at the conference
of which we have just witnessed the close  Headquarters and
machinegun companies must be raised to their respective quotas
of men and each rifle company must be increased from seventy
to two hundred and fifty men each  New recruits will arrive every
week  These men must be whipped into shape  Gentlemen I expect
your tireless aid in making this the finest infantry regiment in
the American line
One or two glances at Colonel Cleaves when he was talking earnestly
were enough to show the observer that this officer meant all he
said  Shirkers among either officers or men would receive scant
consideration in his regiment
Camp Berry at which the Ninetyninth and the Hundredth were stationed
lay in one of the prettiest parts of Georgia  Needless to say
the day was one of sweltering heat and the regimental officers
as they filed out of the company barracks that had been used for
holding the conference fanned themselves busily with their campaign
hats  Each however as he struck the steps leading to the ground
placed his campaign hat squarely on his head
Some pace the KO has set for us murmured Greg as he and
Dick started to walk down the company street
And we must keep that pace if we hope to last in Colonel Cleavess
regiment Dick declared with conviction  Time was when an
officer in the Regular Army could look forward to remaining an
officer as long as he was physically fit and did not disgrace
himself  But in this war any officer regular or otherwise will
find himself laid on the shelf whenever he fails to produce his
full share of usefulness
Do you think its really as bad as that Prescott demanded
Captain Cartwright who was walking just behind them
Worse Dick replied dryly and briefly
Cartwright sighed then took a tighter grip on the swagger stick
that he carried jauntily in his right hand  Cartwright was a smart
soldierly looking chap but was well known as an officer who was
not addicted to hard work
Past three or four barrack buildings on the street the chums walked
Cartwright still keeping just behind them
Look at the work of Sergeant Mock will you demanded Greg
halting short as they came to the edge of one of the drill grounds
Mock belonged to Gregs own company  At this moment the sergeant
was busy or should have been drilling what was supposed to be
a platoon though today it consisted of only two corporals squads
or sixteen men in all
Greg Holmess eyes opened wide with disgust as he watched the
drilling unseen by the sergeant
The platoon had just wheeled and marched off by fours  The cadence
was too slow the men looked slouchy and showed no signs whatever
of spirit
Perhaps the sergeant isnt feeling well remarked Dick with
a smile
He wont be feeling well after he has talked with me Greg uttered
between his teeth
To the further limit of the drill ground the sergeant marched
his platoon then wheeled them and brought them back again  As
he came about the sergeant caught sight of his company commander
In an undertone he gave an order that brought his men along at
greater speed than they had gone
Halt ordered the sergeant and brought up his hand in salute
to the officers
Sergeant Mock called Holmes in a low even voice turn the
men over to a corporal and come here
Hastily and flushing Sergeant Mock came forward
How are the men feeling Greg inquired after signaling the
corporal now in charge to continue the drilling
Tired sir replied Mock with a shamefaced look
And how is the sergeant feeling Greg went on as the corporal
led the men across the drill ground this time at a sharper pace
and correcting any fault in soldierly bearing that he observed
All right sir replied the sergeant
Then if youre feeling all right Sergeant Mock Greg continued
in as even a voice as before explain to me why you were marching
the platoon at a cadence of about ninety instead of the regulation
hundred and twenty steps per minute  Tell me why the alignment
of the fours was poor and why the men were allowed to march without
paying the slightest heed to their bearing
Though there was nothing at all sharp in the company commanders
voice Mock knew that he was being called and in fact was
perilously close to being cussed out
Thethe day is hot sir andand I knew the men were about
played out stammered Mock
How long have you been in the Army sergeant Greg continued
About two years and a half sir
In all that time did you ever know officers or enlisted men to be
excused from full performance of ordered duty on account of the
weather
Nnno sir
Then why did you start a new system on your own authority Greg
asked quietly
Mock tried to answer opened his mouth in fact and uttered a
few incoherent sounds which quickly died in his throat
Sergeant Mock said Greg we have just heard from our commanding
officer  He demands the utmost from every officer noncom and
private  Are you prepared and resolved from this moment to give
the utmost that is in you at all times
Yes sir replied Mock with great emphasis
You mean what you are saying Sergeant
Yes sir
Very good then continued the young captain  I am going to
take your word for it this time  But if I ever find you slacking
or shirking again I am going to go to the colonel immediately and
ask him to break you back to the ranks
Yes sir assented Mock saluting
Are you fully familiar with all your drill work
Yes sir
Then remember that our enemies the German soldiers are men
who are drilled and drilled until they are perfect in their work
and that their discipline is amazing  Keep the fact in mind that
we can hardly hope to whip our enemies unless we are at least as
good soldiers as they  That is all  Go back to your men Sergeant
Standing stiffly erect Sergeant Mock brought up his right hand
in a crisp salute then wheeled and walked briskly back to join
his men  Greg turned as if to say that he did not feel the need
of remaining to watch the rebuked sergeant
By Jove uttered Captain Cartwright  I do wish Holmes youd
come over and dress down some of my noncoms  Ive been trying
for three days to put pep into some of them and the KO frowned
at me this morning
Noncom is the Army abbreviation for noncommissioned
officerscorporals and sergeantswhile KO is Army slang
for commanding officer
Arrived at an unpainted wooden barracks in size and appearance
just like those of the enlisted men the three captains entered
and walked up a flight of stairs to the floor above  Here they
passed through a narrow corridor with doors on both sides that
bore the cards of the officers who slept behind the respective
doors  Cartwright went to his own room while Greg followed Dick
into the latters quarters
Plain enough was the room seven and a half feet wide and ten
feet in length with a single sliding window at the front  Walls
and ceiling like the floor were of pine boards  There were
shelves around two sides of the room with clothing hooks underneath
Under the window was a desk with a cot to one side the rest
of the furniture consisted of two folding camp chairs
Entering Dick hung up his campaign hat on one of the hooks Greg
doing the same  On account of the heat of the day neither young
captain wore a tunic  Each unbuttoned the top button of his olive
drab Army shirt before he dropped into a chair
What do you think of the new KO Dick asked as he picked a
newspaper up from the desk and started to fan himself
He means business Greg returned  I am glad he does Dick
went on  This is no time for slack soldiering  Greg Ill feel
consoled for working eighteen hours a day if it results in making
the Ninetyninth the best infantry regiment of the line
Can it be done Greg inquired
Yes
But Ive a hunch that every other regiment is striving for the
same honor Captain Holmes continued  Ours isnt the only KO
who covets the honor of commanding the best regiment of em all
It can be done Dick insisted and I say it must be done
Yet other regiments would be so close to us in excellence that
it would be hard to name the one that is really best
In that case we wouldnt have won the honor Dick smilingly
insisted
Then consider that fellow Cartwright Greg added lowering his
voice a bit  Hes a born shirker and one weak company would make
a regiment that much poorer
If Cartwright shirks then mark my word that hell be dropped
Dick rejoined quickly  But Greg man this is wartime and
the biggest and most serious war in which we were ever engaged
There must be no doubtsno ifs or buts  We must have a regiment
one hundred per cent perfect  Im going to do my share with
a company one hundred percent good even if I dont find time
for any sleep
Up the corridor there sounded a knock at a door  Something was
said in a low voice  Then the knock was repeated on Prescotts
door
Come in called Dick
An orderly entered saluting
Orders from the adjutant sir said the soldier handing Prescott
a folded paper  He handed one like it to Greg then saluted and
left the room knocking at the next door
Company drill from one to twothirty summarized Prescott glancing
through the typewritten words on the unfolded sheet  Practice
march by battalions from twofortyfive to threefortyfive
Squad drill from four oclock until retreat  That looks brisk Greg
Doesnt it asked Holmes without too plain signs of enthusiasm
Company drill and the hike call for our presence preferably
and yet Ive paper work enough to keep me busy until evening mess
Paper work socalled is the bane of life for the company commander
It consists of keeping making and signing records of the keeping
and inspection of accounts it deals with requisitions for supplies
and an endless number of reports
I have a barrelful of paper work too Dick admitted  But
Im going to see everything going well on the drill ground before I
go near company office
All good things must end grunted Greg rising to his feet even
this rest  Mess will be on in eight minutes
The instant that the door had closed Dick drew off his olive drab
shirt drew out a lidded box from under the bed and deposited
the shirt therein next restoring the box to place bring out a
basin from under the bed and placing it on a chair he found towel
and soap and busied himself with washing up  His toilet completed
he took a clean shirt from a bundle on one of the neatly arranged
shelves and donned the garment  A few more touches and spickandspan
clean and very soldierly looking he descended to the ground floor
A glance into the messroom showed him that the noon meal was not
yet ready so be sauntered to the doorway remaining just inside
out of the suns rays
Other officers gathered quickly  A waiter from mess appeared at
the inner doorway speaking a quiet word that caused the regiments
officers except the colonel and his staff to file inside
Plain pine tables without cloths long pine benches nailed to
the floorofficers mess was exactly like that of the enlisted
men save that officers mess was provided with heavy crockery
while in the company messrooms the men ate from aluminum messkits
Most of the food was already in place on the table  The meal
began with a lively hum of conversation  Occasionally some merry
officer called out jokingly to some officer at another table
there was no special effort at dignified silence
The KO has our number exclaimed an irrepressible lieutenant
How so demanded Noll Terry Prescotts first lieutenant
He knows us for a bunch of shirkers and so he gave us the pep
talk this morning
Is the pep going to work with you asked Noll laughingly
Surely  I wouldnt dare be slow even in drawing my breath
after hearing the KO talk in that fashion
Same here Noll nodded
Ive been working sixteen hours a day ever since I hit camp chimed
in another lieutenant  Whats the new system going to be  Eighteen
hours a day
Twenty perhaps said Gregs first lieutenant cheerfully
The meal had been under way for fifteen minutes when Captain Cartwright
entered leisurely
I suppose you fellows have eaten all the best stuff he called
as he looked about and found a vacant seat though he paused as
if in no great haste to occupy it
Same old Cartwright observed Greg in an undertone to Dick
Hes late even at mess formation
But Cartwright heard and wheeled about looking halfangrily
at young Captain Holmes
Say Holmes youre as free as ever with your tongue
Yes Greg answered unconcernedly  Using it to taste my food
and Ive been finding the taste uncommonly pleasant
You use your tongue in more ways than that snapped Captain
Cartwright  I happened to hear what you said about me in Prescotts
room a few minutes ago
Eavesdropping queried Greg calmly
Whats that snapped Cartwright and his flush deepened  See
here Holmes I dont want any trouble with you
That shows a lively sense of discretion smiled Greg turning
to face the other
But I want you to stop picking on me  Talk about somebody else
for a change
With pleasure nodded Greg as he shrugged his shoulders and
turned to drop a spoonful of sugar in his second cup of coffee
There are lots of agreeable subjects for conversation in Camp
Berry
Meaning demanded Cartwright still standing and scowling
for out of the corners of his eyes he saw that several of his
brother officers were smiling
Meaning almost anything that you wish continued Captain Holmes
serenely as he stirred his coffee
Sit down Cartwright urged a low voice  This is a gentlemans
outfit declared another voice perhaps not intended to reach
Cartwrights ears  But he heard the words and his mounting rage
caused him to take a step nearer to Greg at the same time clenching
his fists
Greg though he realized what was taking place did not bother to
turn but coolly raised his cup to his lips
Sit down called another voice  Youre rocking the boat
But Cartwright took a second step  It is impossible to say what
would have happened but Dick Prescott half turning in his seat
caught the angry captains nearer wrist in a grip of steel and
fairly swang Cartwright into a vacant seat at his left  Greg
was sitting at his right
Dont be foolish Cartwright and dont let the days heat go
to your head Prescott advised  Dont do anything youd regret
Though Captain Cartwrights blood was boiling there was a sense
of quiet mastery in Prescotts manner and voice combined with
a quality of leadership that restrained the angry man for the
next few seconds during which Dick turned to a waiter to say
This meat is cold  Bring some hot meat for Captain Cartwright
and more vegetables  Try some of this salad Cartwrightits
good
Instantly the officers looking eagerly on turned their glances
away and began general conversation again for they were quick
to see that Dicks usual tact was at least postponing a quarrel
It will be a hot afternoon for drill wont it Dick asked
in the next breath and in a low tone
Maybe grunted Cartwright  But perhaps I shall find still
hotter work before the drillcall sounds
Nonsense said Dick quickly  After the KOs talk this morning
dont start anything that will take our mind off our work
Ive got to have a bit more than an explanation from Holmes
the sulky captain continued though in a low voice
Cartwright said Dick in an authoritative undertone I dont
want you to start anything in that direction until youve had a
good talk with me
There the matter ended for the moment  Dick joined in the general
conversation  Presently Cartwright tried to but the officers
to whom he addressed his remarks replied either so briefly or
so coolly that the captain realized that he was not popular at
the present time
Holmes will make trouble for any one who doesnt toady to him
thought Captain Cartwright moodily  I can see that Ive got
to make it my business to take the conceit and arrogance out of him
At almost the same moment over in a company barracks Sergeant
Mock as he chewed his food gloomily was reflecting
So Captain Holmes will call me down before a lot of officers
will he  Hell order me to show more pep will he the
slavedriver  And if I dont hell break me eh
Breaking a noncommissioned officer is securing his reduction
to the grade of private
The captain is so lazy himself that he doesnt know a good man
when he sees one Mock told himself angrily
Then he added threateningly to himself
Hed better not try it  If he does hell sure wish he hadnt
Since this war began even the officers are only on probation and
Ive brains enough to find a way to put him in bad with the
regimental KO
Whats the matter Mock dont you like your food asked the
sergeant seated at his left  Youre scowling something fierce
It isnt the chow Sergeant Mock retorted gruffly
Must be the heat thenor a calldown observed his brother
sergeant
Never you mind retorted Mock  And Im not talking much now
I want to think
Must have been a real cussingout that you got grinned the
other sergeant unconcernedly
Bending over a passing soldier murmured to Mock
Top wants to see you in the company office when youre through
eating
The first sergeant of a company is also known in Army parlance
as the top sergeant or the top cutter
Though he dawdled with his meal Mock did not eat much more  Finally
he rose stalking sulkily from the messroom and across the central
corridor  Thrusting out a hand he turned the knob of the door
of the company office and almost flung the door open stepping
haughtily inside
Mock said First Sergeant Lund looking up youre too old
in the service to enter in that fashion  You know as well as
I do that there is a knock sign painted on the door and that
only an officer is privileged to enter without knocking  Suppose
the captain had been in here when you flung in in that fashion
Hes no better than any one else retorted Mock
Facing about in his chair Sergeant Lund briefly rested one hand
on his desk then sprang to his feet
Attention he commanded sharply
Mock obeyed throwing his head up his chest out and squaring his
shoulders as he dropped his hands straight along either trousers
seam though he sneered
Putting on officers airs are you Lund
No I appear to be talking to a rookie recruit who happens
to be wearing a sergeant chevrons retorted the top sternly
Sergeant Mock in this office or anywhere in my presence you
will refrain from making disrespectful remarks about your officers
And Id advise you to adopt that as your standard at all times
and in all places  Do you get that
I hear you Mock rejoined standing at ease again  You wanted
to see me
Yes  Shortly before recall sounded I looked out of the window
and noticed that you were handling the second platoon in anything
but a soldierly manner  I was about to come out and speak to
you when I observed the captain call you to him  He corrected
your method of handling the platoon didnt he
He thought he did Sergeant Mock responded his lips quivering
But the tone he took or rather the words he said to me arent
the kind that make better soldiers of noncoms
So demanded Sergeant Lund looking sharply into his subordinates
eyes
No Mock snapped sullenly  When an officer wants me to do
my best bes got to treat me like the gentleman that hes supposed
to be
For twenty seconds Sergeant Lund continued his staring at Mock
Then he rested a hand heavily on the others shoulder as he said
Sergeant Mock this is a mans army training to do a nations
share in the biggest war in history  None but a man can do a
mans work and nothing but an army of real men can do the nations
work  If you fit yourself into your place work hard enough and
forget all about yourself except your oath to serve the Flag and
obey your officers I believe that you can do a real mans work
If you do anything different from that Ill knock your block off
without a second word on the subject
A hotly angry reply leaped to Sergeant Mocks lips but he was
wise enough to choke it back  For Sergeant Lund a real man
a real soldier and a loyal American stood before him regarding
him with a look in which there was no faltering nor any doubt as
to his intentions
Thats all Sergeant Mock said the top an instant later
Im going to keep an eye on you and I want to be able to say
a word of praise to you this evening
Two of a kindthe top and the company commander Mock growled
under his breath as he went up the stairs to a squad room above
CHAPTER II
GREG HAS TO BE STERN
A full minute before the bugler sounded the call Captain Dick
Prescott was on hand standing in the shadow of the end of the
barracks of his company  Among other reasons he was there to
note the alacrity with which his men came out of the building
Before the notes of the call had died away most of the men of
his company were on hand his lieutenants among the first  Within
saving time all the rest had appeared except those who had been
excused for one reason or another
A company fall in directed First Sergeant Kelly promptly
As the men fell in in double rank there were a few cases of confusion
for some of the men were rookies who had joined only recently
Sergeant Kelly instruct the other sergeants to see to it that
each man knows his exact place in company formation Dick ordered
Yes sir replied Kelly
The corporals reported briskly the absentees if any in their
squads  The counting of fours sounded next after inspection of
arms
A little more snap in answering when fours are counted Dick
called loudly enough for all the company to hear  Let every
man call his own number instantly and clearly  For instance
when one man has called two let the man at his left call three
without a seconds delay  In the way of good soldiering this
is more important than most of you new men realize  Lieutenant
Terry
Sir the first lieutenant responded stepping forward saluting
Take the company  Drill in dressings facings the manual of
arms wheeling and marching by twos and fours
Then stepping to one side Prescott let his gaze rove over the
company from one file or rank to another  Everything that was
done badly he noted  Presently when the men were standing at
ease he related his observations to Lieutenant Noll Terry who
thereupon gave the company further instruction
Finally when the company started across the drill ground in column
of fours Dick walked briskly into the barracks building going
to the company office whither Sergeant Kelly had preceded him
Kelly and a corporal and private who were there on clerical duty
rose and stood at attention as the captain entered
Rest Dick commanded briefly whereupon the corporal and the
private returned to the desk at which they were working while
Dick crossed to the sergeants desk  Seating himself there he
gave close attention to the papers that Sergeant Kelly handed
him  Such as required signature Captain Prescott signed  Then
for fifteen minutes he busied himself with requisitions for clothing
and equipment  After that other papers required close attention
Following that several matters of company administration had
to be taken up  Finally Sergeant Kelly handed Dick a list on
which names had been written
These seven men have applied for pass from retreat this afternoon
until reveille tomorrow morning reported Dicks top  I have
approved them subject to your action
Reading quickly through the names Prescott replied
Give six of them pass but refuse it to Private Hartley  This
forenoon I observed that he saluted officers very indifferently
when passing them and once Hartley had to be spoken to by an
officer whom he did not see in time to salute him  In whose squad
is Hartley
In Corporal Aspens sir
Then direct Corporal Aspen to take Hartley aside at any time
suited to the corporals convenience this evening  Have the corporal
drill Private Hartley at least twenty minutes in saluting with
of course proper intervals for arm rest
Yes sir  May I offer the captain a suggestion
Yes
