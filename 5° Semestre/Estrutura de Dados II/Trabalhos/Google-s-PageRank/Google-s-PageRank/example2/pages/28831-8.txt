DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
IN CONGRESS July 4 1776
By the Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled
A DECLARATION
When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another
and to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal
station to which the laws of nature and of natures God entitle them a
decent respect for the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation
We hold these truths to be selfevidentthat all men are created
equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of
happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among
men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that
whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is
the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute a
new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing
its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their safety and happiness Prudence indeed will dictate that
governments long established should not be changed for light and
transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind
are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right
themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed But
when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the
same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism
it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and
to provide new guards for their future security Such has been the
patient sufferance of these colonies and such is now the necessity
which constrains them to alter their former system of government The
history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated
injuries and usurpations all having in direct object the establishment
of an absolute tyranny over these States To prove this let facts be
submitted to a candid world
He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for
the public good
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing
importance unless suspended in their operation till his assent should
be obtained and when so suspended he has utterly neglected to attend
to them
He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large
districts of people unless those people would relinquish the right of
representation in the legislaturea right inestimable to them and
formidable to tyrants only
He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual
uncomfortable and distant from the depository of their public records
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
measures
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with
manly firmness his invasions on the right of the people
He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause others
to be elected whereby the legislative powers incapable of
annihilation have returned to the people at large for their exercise
the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the danger of
invasion from without and convulsions within
He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States for that
purpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners refusing
to pass others to encourage their migration hither and raising the
conditions of new appropriations of lands
He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent
to laws for establishing judiciary powers
He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their
offices and the amount and payment of their salaries
He has erected a multitude of new offices and sent hither swarms of
officers to harass our people and eat out their substance
He has kept among us in times of peace standing armies without the
consent of our legislatures
He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to
the civil power
He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to
our constitution and unacknowledged by our laws giving his assent to
their acts of pretended legislation
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us
For protecting them by a mock trial from punishment for any murders
which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States
For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world
For imposing taxes on us without our consent
For depriving us in many cases of the benefits of trial by jury
For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offences
For abolishing the free system of English law in a neighboring province
establishing therein an arbitrary government and enlarging its
boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for
introducing the same absolute rule into these colonies
For taking away our charters abolishing our most valuable laws and
altering fundamentally the forms of our government
For suspending our own legislatures and declaring themselves invested
with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever
He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection
and waging war against us
He has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burned our towns and
destroyed the lives of our people
He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to
complete the works of death desolation and tyranny already begun
with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the
most barbarous ages and totally unworthy the head of a civilized
nation
He has constrained our fellowcitizens taken captive on the high seas
to bear arms against their country to become the executioners of their
friends and brethren or to fall themselves by their hands
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us and has endeavored to
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages
whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all
ages sexes and conditions
In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in
the most humble terms our petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may
define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people
Nor have we been wanting in attention to our British brethren We have
warned them from time to time of attempts made by their legislature to
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us We have reminded them of
the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here We have
appealed to their native justice and magnanimity and we have conjured
them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations
which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence
They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity We
must therefore acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our
separation and hold them as we hold the rest of mankind enemies in
warin peace friends
We therefore the representatives of the United States of America in
General Congress assembled appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world
for the rectitude of our intentions do in the name and by the
authority of the good people of these colonies solemnly publish and
declare that these United Colonies are and of good right ought to be
free and independent States that they are absolved from all allegiance
to the British crown and that all political connection between them and
the State of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved and
that as free and independent States they have full power to levy war
conclude peace contract alliances establish commerce and to do all
other acts and things which independent States may of right do And for
the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection
of Divine Providence we mutually pledge to each other our lives our
fortunes and our sacred honor
