VEDIC HYMNS
Translation by F Max Muller
INTRODUCTION
The Vedic Hymns are among the most interesting portions of Hindoo
literature In form and spirit they resemble both the poems of the
Hebrew psalter and the lyrics of Pindar They deal with the most
elemental religious conceptions and are full of the imagery of nature
It would be absurd to deny to very many of them the possession of the
truest poetic inspiration The scenery of the Himalayas ice and snow
storm and tempest lend their majesty to the strains of the Vedic poet
He describes the storm sweeping over the whitecrested mountains till
the earth like a hoary king trembles with fear The Maruts or
stormgods are terrible glorious musical riding on stronghoofed
neverwearying steeds There is something Homeric Pindaric in these
epithets Yet Soma and Rudra are addressed though they wield sharp
weapons and sharp bolts ie those of the lightning are spoken of as
kind friends Deliver us says the poet from the snare of Varuna
and guard us as kindhearted gods One of the most remarkable of these
hymns is that addressed to the Unknown God The poet says In the
beginning there arose the Golden Child As soon as he was born he alone
was the lord of all that is He established the earth and this heaven
The hymn consists of ten stanzas in which the Deity is celebrated as
the maker of the snowy mountains the sea and the distant river who
made fast the awful heaven He who alone is God above all gods before
whom heaven and earth stand trembling in their mind Each stanza
concludes with the refrain Who is the God to whom we shall offer
sacrifice
We have in this hymn a most sublime conception of the Supreme Being and
while there are many Vedic hymns whose tone is pantheistic and seems to
imply that the wild forces of nature are Gods who rule the world this
hymn to the Unknown God is as purely monotheistic as a psalm of David
and shows a spirit of religious awe as profound as any we find in the
Hebrew Scriptures
It is very difficult to arrive at the true date of the Vedas The word
Veda means knowledge and is applied to unwritten literature The Vedas
are therefore the oldest Sanscrit writings which exist and stand in the
same class with regard to Hindoo literature as Homer does with regard to
Greek literature Probably the earliest Vedas were recited a thousand
years before Christ while the more recent of the hymns date about five
hundred before Christ We must therefore consider them to be the most
primitive form of Aryan poetry in existence
There is in the West a misunderstanding as to the exact meaning of
Vedic and Sanscrit for the latter is often used as if it were
synonymous with Indian whereas only the later Indian literature can be
classed under that head and Vedic is often used to indicate only the
Vedic Hymns whereas it really denotes Hymns Brahmanas Upanishads and
Sutras in fact all literature which orthodox Hindoos regard as sacred
The correct distinction then between the Vedic and the Sanscrit writings
is that of holy writ and profane literature

VEDIC HYMNS
TO THE UNKNOWN GOD
In the beginning there arose the Golden Child As soon as born he alone
was the lord of all that is He established the earth and this
heavenWho is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
He who gives breath he who gives strength whose command all the bright
gods revere whose shadow is immortality whose shadow is deathWho is
the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
He who through his might became the sole king of the breathing and
twinkling world who governs all this man and beastWho is the God to
whom we shall offer sacrifice
He through whose might these snowy mountains are and the sea they say
with the distant river he of whom these regions are indeed the two
armsWho is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
He through whom the awful heaven and the earth were made fast he
through whom the ether was established and the firmament he who
measured the air in the skyWho is the God to whom we shall offer
sacrifice
He to whom heaven and earth standing firm by his will look up
trembling in their mind he over whom the risen sun shines forthWho
is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
When the great waters went everywhere holding the germ and generating
light then there arose from them the breath of the godsWho is the
God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
He who by his might looked even over the waters which held power and
generated the sacrifice he who alone is God above all godsWho is the
God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
May he not hurt us he who is the begetter of the earth or he the
righteous who begat the heaven he who also begat the bright and mighty
watersWho is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice
Pragapati no other than thou embraces all these created things May
that be ours which we desire when sacrificing to thee may we be lords
of wealth
TO THE MARUTS1
I
Come hither Maruts on your chariots charged with lightning resounding
with beautiful songs stored with spears and winged with horses Fly to
us like birds with your best food you mighty ones They come
gloriously on their red or it may be on their tawny horses which
hasten their chariots He who holds the axe is brilliant like
goldwith the tire of the chariot they have struck the earth On your
bodies there are daggers for beauty may they stir up our minds as they
stir up the forests For yourselves O wellborn Maruts the vigorous
among you shake the stone for distilling Soma Days went round you and
came back O hawks back to this prayer and to this sacred rite the
Gotamas making prayer with songs pushed up the lid of the cloud to
drink No such hymn was ever known as this which Gotama sounded for you
O Maruts when he saw you on golden wheels wild boars rushing about
with iron tusks This comforting speech rushes sounding towards you
like the speech of a suppliant it rushed freely from our hands as our
speeches are wont to do
II
Let us now proclaim for the robust host for the herald of the powerful
Indra their ancient greatness O ye strongvoiced Maruts you heroes
prove your powers on your march as with a torch as with a sword Like
parents bringing a dainty to their own son the wild Maruts play
playfully at the sacrifices The Rudras reach the worshipper with their
protection strong in themselves they do not fail the sacrificer For
him to whom the immortal guardians have given fulness of wealth and who
is himself a giver of oblations the Maruts who gladden men with the
milk of rain pour out like friends many clouds You who have stirred
up the clouds with might your horses rushed forth selfguided All
beings who dwell in houses are afraid of you your march is brilliant
with your spears thrust forth When they whose march is terrible have
caused the rocks to tremble or when the manly Maruts have shaken the
back of heaven then every lord of the forest fears at your racing each
shrub flies out of your way whirling like chariotwheels You O
terrible Maruts whose ranks are never broken favorably fulfil our
prayer Wherever your glorytoothed lightning bites it crunches cattle
like a wellaimed bolt The Maruts whose gifts are firm whose bounties
are never ceasing who do not revile and who are highly praised at the
sacrifices they sing their song for to drink the sweet juice they know
the first manly deeds of the hero Indra The man whom you have guarded
O Maruts shield him with hundredfold strongholds from injury and
mischiefthe man whom you O fearful powerful singers protect from
reproach in the prosperity of his children On your chariots O Maruts
there are all good things strong weapons are piled up clashing against
each other When you are on your journeys you carry the rings on your
shoulders and your axle turns the two wheels at once In their manly
arms there are many good things on their chests golden chains flaring
ornaments on their shoulders speckled deerskins on their fellies
sharp edges as birds spread their wings they spread out splendors
behind They mighty by might allpowerful powers visible from afar
like the heavens with the stars sweettoned softtongued singers with
their mouths the Maruts united with Indra shout all around This is
your greatness O wellborn Marutsyour bounty extends far as the
sway of Aditi Not even Indra in his scorn can injure that bounty on
whatever man you have bestowed it for his good deeds This is your
kinship with us O Maruts that you immortals in former years have
often protected the singer Having through this prayer granted a hearing
to man all these heroes together have become well known by their
valiant deeds That we may long flourish O Maruts with your wealth O
ye racers that our men may spread in the camp therefore let me achieve
the rite with these offerings May this praise O Maruts this song of
Mandarya the son of Mana the poet ask you with food for offspring for
ourselves May we have an invigorating autumn with quickening rain
III
For the manly host the joyful the wise for the Maruts bring thou O
Nodhas a pure offering I prepare songs like as a handy priest wise
in his mind prepares the water mighty at sacrifices They are born
the tall bulls of heaven the manly youths of Rudra the divine the
blameless pure and bright like suns scattering raindrops full of
terrible designs like giants The youthful Rudras they who never grow
old the slayers of the demon have grown irresistible like mountains
They throw down with their strength all beings even the strongest on
earth and in heaven They deck themselves with glittering ornaments for
a marvellous show on their chests they fastened gold chains for beauty
the spears on their shoulders pound to pieces they were born together
by themselves the men of Dyu They who confer power the roarers the
devourers of foes they made winds and lightnings by their powers The
shakers milk the heavenly udders they sprinkle the earth all round with
milk The bounteous Maruts pour forth water mighty at sacrifices the
fat milk of the clouds They seem to lead about the powerful horse the
cloud to make it rain they milk the thundering unceasing spring
Mighty they are powerful of beautiful splendor strong in themselves
like mountains yet swiftly gliding alongyou chew up forests like
wild elephants when you have assumed your powers among the red flames
Like lions they roar the wise Maruts they are handsome like gazelles
the allknowing By night with their spotted rainclouds and with their
spearslightningsthey rouse the companions together they whose ire
through strength is like the ire of serpents You who march in
companies the friends of man heroes whose ire through strength is
like the ire of serpents salute heaven and earth On the seats on your
chariots O Maruts the lightning stands visible like light
Allknowing surrounded with wealth endowed with powers singers men
of endless prowess armed with strong rings they the archers have
taken the arrow in their fists The Maruts who with the golden tires of
their wheels increase the rain stir up the clouds like wanderers on the
road They are brisk indefatigable they move by themselves they throw
down what is firm the Maruts with their brilliant spears make
everything to reel We invoke with prayer the offspring of Rudra the
brisk the pure the worshipful the active Cling for happinesssake to
the strong company of the Maruts the chasers of the sky the powerful
the impetuous The mortal whom ye Maruts protected he indeed
surpasses people in strength through your protection He carries off
booty with his horses treasures with his men he acquires honorable
wisdom and he prospers Give O Maruts to our lords strength glorious
invincible in battle brilliant wealthacquiring praiseworthy known
to all men Let us foster our kith and kin during a hundred winters
Will you then O Maruts grant unto us wealth durable rich in men
defying all onslaughtswealth a hundred and a thousandfold always
increasingMay he who is rich in prayers come early and soon
IV
Sing forth O Kanvas to the sportive host of your Maruts brilliant on
their chariots and unscathedthey who were born together
selfluminous with the spotted deer the spears the daggers the
glittering ornaments I hear their whips almost close by when they
crack them in their hands they gain splendor on their way Sing forth
the godgiven prayer to the wild host of your Maruts endowed with
terrible vigor and strength Celebrate the bull among the cows for it
is the sportive host of the Maruts he grew as he tasted the rain Who
O ye men is the strongest among you here ye shakers of heaven and
earth when you shake them like the hem of a garment At your approach
the son of man holds himself down the gnarled cloud fled at your fierce
anger They at whose racings the earth like a hoary king trembles for
fear on their ways their birth is strong indeed there is strength to
come forth from their mother nay there is vigor twice enough for it
And these sons the singers stretched out the fences in their racings
the cows had to walk kneedeep They cause this long and broad unceasing
rain to fall on their ways O Maruts with such strength as yours you
have caused men to tremble you have caused the mountains to tremble As
the Maruts pass along they talk together on the way does anyone hear
them Come fast on your quick steeds there are worshippers for you
among the Kanvas may you well rejoice among them Truly there is enough
for your rejoicing We always are their servants that we may live even
the whole of life
V
To every sacrifice you hasten together you accept prayer after prayer
O quick Maruts Let me therefore bring you hither by my prayers from
heaven and earth for our welfare and for our great protection the
shakers who were born to bring food and light selfborn and
selfsupported like springs like thousandfold waves of water aye
visibly like unto excellent bulls those Maruts like Somadrops which
squeezed from ripe stems dwell when drunk in the hearts of the
worshippersee how on their shoulders there clings as if a clinging
wife in their hands the quoit is held and the sword Lightly they have
come down from heaven of their own accord Immortals stir yourselves
with the whip The mighty Maruts on dustless paths armed with brilliant
spears have shaken down even the strong places O ye Maruts who are
armed with lightningspears who stirs you from within by himself as
the jaws are stirred by the tongue You shake the sky as if on the
search for food you are invoked by many like the solar horse of the
day Where O Maruts is the top where the bottom of the mighty sky
where you came When you throw down with the thunderbolt what is strong
like brittle things you fly across the terrible sea As your conquest
is violent splendid terrible full and crushing so O Maruts is your
gift delightful like the largess of a liberal worshipper
widespreading laughing like heavenly lightning From the tires of
their chariotwheels streams gush forth when they send out the voice of
the clouds the lightnings smiled upon the earth when the Maruts shower
down fatness Prisni brought forth for the great fight the terrible
train of the untiring Maruts when fed they produced the dark cloud and
then looked about for invigorating food May this praise O Maruts this
song of Mandarya the son of Mana the poet ask you with food for
offspring for ourselves May we have an invigorating autumn with
quickening rain
VI
The Maruts charged with rain endowed with fierce force terrible like
wild beasts blazing in their strength brilliant like fires and
impetuous have uncovered the raingiving cows by blowing away the
cloud The Maruts with their rings appeared like the heavens with their
stars they shone wide like streams from clouds as soon as Rudra the
strong man was born for you O goldenbreasted Maruts in the bright
lap of Prisni They wash their horses like racers in the courses they
hasten with the points of the reed on their quick steeds O goldenjawed
Maruts violently shaking your jaws you go quick with your spotted
deer being friends of one mind Those Maruts have grown to feed all
these beings or it may be they have come hither for the sake of a
friend they who always bring quickening rain They have spotted horses
their bounties cannot be taken away they are like headlong charioteers
on their ways O Maruts wielding your brilliant spears come hither on
smooth roads with your fiery cows whose udders are swelling being of
one mind like swans toward their nests to enjoy the sweet offering O
oneminded Maruts come to our prayers come to our libations like Indra
praised by men Fulfil our prayer like the udder of a barren cow and
make the prayer glorious by booty to the singer Grant us this strong
horse for our chariot a draught that rouses our prayers from day to
day food to the singers and to the poet in our homesteads luck
wisdom inviolable and invincible strength When the goldbreasted
Maruts harness the horses to their chariots bounteous in wealth then
it is as if a cow in the folds poured out to her calf copious food to
every man who has offered libations Whatever mortal enemy may have
placed us among wolves shield us from hurt ye Vasus Turn the wheels
with burning heat against him and strike down the weapon of the impious
fiend O Rudras Your march O Maruts appears brilliant whether even
friends have milked the udder of Prisni or whether O sons of Rudra
you mean to blame him who praises you and to weaken those who are
weakening Trita O unbeguiled heroes We invoke you the great Maruts
the constant wanderers at the offering of the rapid Vishnu holding
ladles and prayerful we ask the goldencolored and exalted Maruts for
glorious wealth The Dasagvas carried on the sacrifice first may they
rouse us at the break of dawn Like the dawn they uncover the dark
nights with the red rays the strong ones with their brilliant light
as with a sea of milk With the morning clouds as if with glittering
red ornaments these Maruts have grown great in the sacred places
Streaming down with rushing splendor they have assumed their bright and
brilliant color Approaching them for their great protection to help us
we invoke them with this worship they whom Trita may bring near like
the five Hotri priests for victory descending on their chariot to help
May that grace of yours by which you help the wretched across all
anguish and by which you deliver the worshipper from the reviler come
hither O Maruts may your favor approach us like a cow going to her
calf
VII
I come to you with this adoration with a hymn I implore the favor of
the quick Maruts O Maruts you have rejoiced in it clearly put down
then all anger and unharness your horses This reverent praise of yours
O Maruts fashioned in the heart has been offered by the mind O gods
Come to it pleased in your mind for you give increase to our worship
May the Maruts when they have been praised be gracious to us and
likewise Indra the best giver of happiness when he has been praised
May our lances through our valor stand always erect O Maruts I am
afraid of this powerful one and trembling in fear of Indra For you the
offerings were preparedwe have now put them away forgive us Thou
through whom the Manas see the mornings whenever the eternal dawns
flash forth with power O Indra O strong hero grant thou glory to us
with the Maruts terrible with the terrible ones strong and a giver of
victory O Indra protect thou these bravest of men let thy anger be
turned away from the Maruts for thou hast become victorious together
with those brilliant heroes May we have an invigorating autumn with
quickening rain
VIII
O Maruts that man in whose dwelling you drink the Soma ye mighty sons
of heaven he indeed has the best guardians You who are propitiated
either by sacrifices or from the prayers of the sage hear the call O
Maruts Aye the powerful man to whom you have granted a sage he will
live in a stable rich in cattle On the altar of this strong man Soma is
poured out in daily sacrifices praise and joy are sung To him let the
mighty Maruts listen to him who surpasses all men as the flowing
rainclouds pass over the sun For we O Maruts have sacrificed at many
harvests through the mercies of the stormgods May that mortal be
blessed O chasing Maruts whose offerings you carry off You take
notice either of the sweat of him who praises you ye men of true
strength or of the desire of the suppliant O ye of true strength make
this manifest with might strike the fiend with your lightning Hide the
hideous darkness destroy every tusky fiend Make the light which we
long for
IX
Endowed with exceeding vigor and power the singers the never
flinching the immovable the impetuous the most beloved and most
manly have decked themselves with their glittering ornaments a few
only like the heavens with the stars When you have seen your way
through the clefts like birds O Maruts on whatever road it be then
the clouds on your chariots trickle everywhere and you pour out the
honeylike fatness for him who praises you At their racings the earth
shakes as if broken when on the heavenly paths they harness their deer
for victory They the sportive the roaring with bright spears the
shakers of the clouds have themselves glorified their greatness That
youthful company with their spotted horses moves by itself hence it
exercises lordship invested with powers Thou indeed art true thou
searchest out sin thou art without blemish Therefore the manly host
will help this prayer We speak after the kind of our old father our
tongue goes forth at the sight of the Soma when the singers had joined
Indra in deed then only they took their holy namesthese Maruts
armed with beautiful rings obtained splendors for their glory they
obtained rays and men to celebrate them nay armed with daggers
speeding along and fearless they found the beloved domain of the
Maruts
X
What then now When will you take us as a dear father takes his son by
both hands O ye gods for whom the sacred grass has been trimmed Where
now On what errand of yours are you going in heaven not on earth
Where are your cows sporting Where are your newest favors O Maruts
Where the blessings Where all delights If you sons of Prisni were
mortals and your praiser an immortal then never should your praiser be
unwelcome like a deer in pasture grass nor should he go on the path of
Yama Let not one sin after another difficult to be conquered overcome
us may it depart together with greed Truly they are terrible and
powerful even to the desert the Rudriyas bring rain that is never dried
up The lightning lows like a cow it follows as a mother follows after
her young when the shower of the Maruts has been let loose Even by day
the Maruts create darkness with the waterbearing cloud when they
drench the earth Then from the shouting of the Maruts over the whole
space of the earth men reeled forward Maruts on your stronghoofed
neverwearying steeds go after those bright ones which are still locked
up May your fellies be strong the chariots and their horses may your
reins be wellfashioned Speak forth forever with thy voice to praise
the Lord of prayer Agni who is like a friend the bright one Fashion
a hymn in thy mouth Expand like the cloud Sing a song of praise
Worship the host of the Maruts the terrible the glorious the musical
May they be magnified here among us
XI
Let your voiceborn prayers go forth to the great Vishnu accompanied by
the Maruts Evayamarut and to the chasing host adorned with good
rings the strong in their jubilant throng to the shouting power of
the Maruts O Maruts you who are born great and proclaim it yourselves
by knowledge Evayamarut that power of yours cannot be approached by
wisdom that power of theirs cannot be approached by gift or might they
are like unapproachable mountains They who are heard with their voice
from the high heaven the brilliant and strong Evayamarut in whose
council no tyrant reigns the rushing chariots of these roaring Maruts
come forth like fires with their own lightning The widestriding
Vishnu strode forth from the great common seat Evayamarut When he has
started by himself from his own place along the ridges O ye striving
mighty Maruts he goes together with the heroes conferring blessings
Impetuous like your own shout the strong one made everything tremble
the terrible the wanderer the mighty Evayamarut strong with him you
advanced selfluminous with firm reins golden colored well armed
speeding along Your greatness is infinite ye Maruts endowed with full
power may that terrible power help Evayamarut In your raid you are
indeed to be seen as charioteers deliver us therefore from the enemy
like shining fires May then these Rudras lively like fires and with
vigorous shine help Evayamarut The seat of the earth is stretched out
far and wide when the hosts of these faultless Maruts come quickly to
the races Come kindly on your path O Maruts listen to the call of him
who praises you Evayamarut Confidants of the great Vishnu may you
together like charioteers keep all hateful things far by your
wonderful skill Come zealously to our sacrifice ye worshipful hear
our guileless call Evayamarut Like the oldest mountains in the sky O
wise guardians prove yourselves for him irresistible to the enemy
XII
O Syavasva sing boldly with the Maruts the singers who worthy
themselves of sacrifice rejoice in their guileless glory according to
their nature They are indeed boldly the friends of strong power they
on their march protect all who by themselves are full of daring Like
rushing bulls these Maruts spring over the dark cows and then we
perceive the might of the Maruts in heaven and on earth Let us boldly
offer praise and sacrifice to your Maruts to all them who protect the
generation of men who protect the mortal from injury They who are
worthy bounteous men of perfect strength to those heavenly Maruts who
are worthy of sacrifice praise the sacrifice The tall men coming near
with their bright chains and their weapon have hurled forth their
spears Behind these Maruts there came by itself the splendor of heaven
like laughing lightnings Those who have grown up on earth or in the
wide sky or in the realm of the rivers or in the abode of the great
heaven praise that host of the Maruts endowed with true strength and
boldness whether those rushing heroes have by themselves harnessed
their horses for triumph or whether these brilliant Maruts have in the
speckled cloud clothed themselves in wool or whether by their strength
they cut the mountain asunder with the tire of their chariot call them
comers or goers or enterers or followers under all these names they
watch on the straw for my sacrifice The men watch and their steeds
watch Then so brilliant are their forms to be soon that people say
Look at the strangers In measured steps and wildly shouting the gleemen
have danced towards the cloud They who appeared one by one like
thieves were helpers to me to see the light Worship therefore O
seer that host of Maruts and keep and delight them with your voice
they who are themselves wise poets tall heroes armed with
lightningspears Approach O seer the host of Maruts as a woman
approaches a friend for a gift and you Maruts bold in your strength
