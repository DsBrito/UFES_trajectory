CHAPTER I
A NEW BOY
Whats your name
Diggory Trevanock
The whole class exploded
Now then said Mr Blake looking up from his markbook with a broad
grin on his own facenow then theres nothing to laugh atLook
here he added turning to the new boy how dyou spell it
Instead of being at all annoyed or disconcerted at the mirth of his
classmates the youngster seemed rather to enjoy the joke and
immediately rattled out a semihumorous reply to the masters
question
D I G dig G O R Y goryDiggory T R E tre VAN van O C K
ockTrevanock  Then turning round he smiled complacently at the
occupants of the desks behind as much as to say There Ive done
all I can to amuse you and I hope youre satisfied
This incident one of the little pleasantries occasionally permitted by
a class master and which like a judges jokes in court are always
welcomed as a momentary relief from the depressing monotony of the
serious business in handthis little incident I say happened in the
second class of a small preparatory school situated on the outskirts of
the market town of Chatford and intended according to the wording of a
standing advertisement in the Denfordshire Chronicle for the sons of
gentlemen
This establishment which bore the somewhat suggestive name of The
Birches was owned and presided over by Mr Welsby who with an
unmarried daughter  Miss Eleanor acting as housekeeper and his
nephew Mr Blake performing the duties of assistantmaster undertook
the preliminary education of about a dozen juveniles whose ages ranged
between ten and fourteen
On the previous evening returning from the Christmas holidays exactly
twelve had mustered round the big table in the diningroom no new
faces had appeared and Fred Acton a big strong youngster of fourteen
and a half was undisputed cock of the walk
The school was divided into two classes  The first containing the five
elder scholars went to sit at the feet of Mr Welsby himself while the
second remained behind in what was known as the schoolroom and received
instruction from Mr Blake
It was while thus occupied on the first morning of the term that the
lower division were surprised by the sudden appearance of a new boy
Miss Eleanor brought him into the room and after a few moments
whispered conversation with her cousin smiled round the class and then
withdrew  Every one worshipped Miss Eleanor but thats neither here
nor there  A  moment later Mr Blake put the question which stands
at the commencement of this chapter
The newcomers answer made a favourable impression on the minds of his
companions and as soon as the mornings work was over they set about
the task of mutual introduction in a far more friendly manner than was
customary on these occasions  He was a wiry little chap with bright
eyes for ever on the twinkle and black hair pasted down upon his head
so as not to show the slightest vestige of curl while the sharp
mischievous look on his face and the quick comical movements of his
body suggested something between a terrier and a monkey
There was never very much going on in the way of regular sports or
pastimes at The Birches the smallness of numbers made it difficult to
attempt proper games of cricket or football and the boys were forced to
content themselves with such substitutes as prisoners base cross tag
etc or in carrying out the projects of Fred Acton who was constantly
making suggestions for the employment of their time and compelling
everybody to conform to his wishes
Mr Welsby had been a widower for many years he was a grave scholarly
man who spent most of his spare time in his own library  Mr Blake was
supposed to take charge out of school hours he was as every one said
a jolly fellow and the fact that his popularity extended far and wide
among a large circle of friends and acquaintances caused him to have a
good many irons in the fire of one sort and another  During their hours
of leisure therefore the Birchites were left pretty much to their own
devices or more often to those of Master Fred Acton who liked as has
already been stated to assume the office of bellwether to the little
flock
At the time when our story commences the ground was covered with snow
but Acton was equal to the occasion and as soon as dinner was over
ordered all hands to come outside and make a slide
The garden was on a steep slope along the bottom of which ran the brick
wall bounding one side of the playground a straight steep path lay
between this and the house and the youthful dux with his usual
disregard of life and limb insisted on choosing this as the scene of
operations
What he cried in answer to a feeble protest on the part of Mugford
make it on level ground  Of course not when weve got this jolly hill
to go down not if I know it  Well open the door at the bottom and go
right on into the playground
But how if any one goes a bit crooked and runs up against the bricks
Well theyll get pretty well smashed or he will  You must go
straight thats half the fun of the thingitll make it all the more
exciting  Come on and begin to tread down the snow
Without daring to show any outward signs of reluctance but with
feelings very much akin to those of men digging their own graves before
being shot the company set about putting this fearful project into
execution  In about half an hour the slide was in good working order
and then the fun began
Mugford and one or two others whose prudence exceeded their valour
made a point of sitting down before they had gone many yards preferring
to take the fall in a milder form than it would have assumed at a later
period in the journey  To the bolder spirits however every trip was
like leading a forlorn hope none expecting to return from the
enterprise unscathed  The pace was terrific on nearing the playground
wall all the events of a lifetime might have flashed across the memory
as at the last gasp of a drowning man and if fortunate enough to whiz
through the doorway and pull up all standing on the level stretch
beyond it was to draw a deep breath and regard the successful
performance of the feat as an escape from catastrophe which was nothing
short of miraculous  The unevenness of the ground made it almost
impossible to steer a straight course  A boy might be halfway down the
path when suddenly he felt himself beginning to turn round an agonized
look spread over his face he made one frantic attempt to keep as it
were head to the sea there was an awful moment when house garden
sky and playground wall spun round and round and then the little group
of onlookers their hearts hardened by their own sufferings burst into
a roar of laughter while Acton slapped his leg crying Hes over
What a stunning lark  Whos next
At the end of an hour and a half most of the company were temporarily
disabled and even their chief had not escaped scot free
Now then for a regular spanker he cried rushing at the slide
A spanker it certainly was six yards from the commencement his legs
flew from under him he soared into the air like a bird and did not
touch the ground again until he sat down heavily within twenty paces of
the bottom of the slope
One might have supposed that this catastrophe would have somewhat damped
the sufferers ardour but instead of that he only seemed fired with a
fresh desire to break his neck
He hobbled up the hill and pausing for a moment at the top to take
breath suddenly exclaimed Look here Im going down it on skates
Every one stood aghast at this rash determination but Acton hurried off
into the house and soon returned with the skates  He sat down on a
bank and was proceeding to put them on when he discovered that
by some oversight he had brought out the wrong pair  Bother it these
arent mine theyre too short whose are they
I think theyre mine faltered Mugford
Well put em on
But I dont want to
But I say you must
Oh please Acton I really cant I
Shut up Look here some ones got to go down that slide on skates so
just put em on
It was at this moment that Diggory Trevanock stepped forward and
remarked in a casual manner that if Mugford didnt wish to do it but
would lend him the skates he himself would go down the slide
His companions stared at him in astonishment coupled with which was a
feeling of regret he was a nice little chap and they had already begun
to like him and did not wish to see him dashed to pieces against the
playground wall before their very eyes  Acton however had decreed
that some one had got to go down that slide on skates and it seemed
only meet and right that if a victim had to be sacrificed it should be a
new boy rather than an old stager
Bravo cried the dux heres one chap at least whos no funk
Put em on sharp the bell ll ring in a minute
Several willing hands were stretched out to assist in arming Diggory for
the enterprise and in a few moments he was assisted to the top of the
slide
All right he said let go
The spectators held their breath hardly daring to watch what would
happen  But fortune favours the brave  The adventurous juvenile rushed
down the path shot like an arrow through the doorway and the next
instant was seen ploughing up the snow in the playground and eventually
disappearing head first into the middle of a big drift
His companions all rushed down in a body to haul him out of the snow
Acton smacked him on the back and called him a trump while Jack Vance
presented him on the spot with a mincepie which had been slightly
damaged in one of the donors many tumbles but was as he remarked
just as good as new for eating
From that moment until the day he left there was never a more popular
boy at The Birches than Diggory Trevanock
I say remarked Mugford as they met a short time later in the
cloakroom that was awfully good of you to go down the slide instead
of me what ever made you do it
Well answered the other calmly I thought it would save me a lot of
bother if I showed you fellows at once that I wasnt a muff  I dont
mind telling you I was in rather a funk when it came to the start but
Id said Id do it and of course I couldnt draw back
The numerous stirring events which happened at The Birches during the
next three terms and which it will be my pleasing duty to chronicle in
subsequent chapters gave the boys plenty of opportunity of testing the
character of their new companion or in plainer English of finding out
the stuff he was made of and whatever his other faults may have been
this at least is certain that no one ever found occasion to charge
Diggory Trevanock with being either a muff or a coward
One might have thought that the slide episode would have afforded
excitement enough for a new boys first day at school yet before it
closed he was destined to be mixed up in an adventure of a still
more thrilling character
The Birches was an old house and though its outward appearance was
modern enough the interior impressed even youthful minds with a feeling
of reverence for its age  The heavy timbers the queer shape of some of
the bedrooms and attics the narrow crooked passages and the little
unexpected flights of stairs were all things belonging to a bygone age
of which the pupils were secretly proud and which caused them to
remember the place and think of it at the time as being in some way
different from an ordinary school
I say Diggy exclaimed Jack Vance addressing the new boy by the
friendly abbreviation which seemed by mutual consent to have been
bestowed upon him in recognition of his daring exploitI say Diggy
youre in my bedroom theres you and me and Mugford  Mugs an awful
chump but hes a goodnatured old duffer and you and Ill do the
fighting
What do you mean
Why sometimes when Blake is out spending the evening and old Welsby
is shut up in his library the different rooms make raids on one
another  It began the term before last  Blake had been teaching us all
about how the Crusaders used to go out every now and then and make war
in Palestine and so the fellows on the west side of the house called
themselves the Crusaders and we were Infidels and theyd come over and
rag us and we should drive them back  Miss Eleanor came up one night
and caught us in the middle of a battle  O Diggy she is a trump
Blake asked her next day before us all which boys had been out on the
landing because he meant to punish them and she laughed and said
Im sure I cant tell you  Why when I saw they were all in their
nightshirts I shut my eyes at once  Of course it was all an excuse
for not giving us away  She doesnt mind seeing chaps in their
nightshirts when theyre ill we all know that and once or twice
when for some reason or other she told us on the quiet that there
mustnt be any disturbance that evening no one ever went crusading
Acton would have licked them if they had  Actons going to propose to
Miss Eleanor some day he told us so and
But what about the bedrooms interrupted Diggory have you given up
having crusades
Yes but we have other things instead  We call our rooms by different
names and its all against all one lot come and make a raid on you
and then you go and pay them out  This term Kennedy and Jacobs sleep in
the room above ours and next to the big attic  Theyre always reading
sea stories and they call their room the Maintop because its so
high up  Then at the end of the passage are Acton Shaw and Morris
and theyre the House of Lords and next to them is the Dogs Home
where all the other fellows are put
A few hours later Diggory and his two roommates were standing at the
foot of their beds and discussing the formation of a few simple rules
for conducting a race in undressing the last man to put the candle out
You neednt bother to race said Mugford Ill do itIm sure to be
the last
No you arent answered Vance  Well give you coat and waistcoat
start itll be good fun
At this moment the door was suddenly flung open two halfdressed
figures sprang into the room and discharged a couple of snowballs
pointblank at its occupants  One of the missiles struck Diggory on the
shoulder and the other struck Mugford fair and square on the side of
the head the fragments flying all over the floor  There was a subdued
yell of triumph the door was slammed to with a bang and the muffled
sound of stockinged feet thudding up the neighbouring staircase showed
that the enemy were in full retreat
Its those confounded Maintop men cried Jack Vance I will pay them
out  I wonder where the fellows got the snow from
Oh I expect they opened the window and took it off the ledge
answered Diggory  Look herelets sweep it up into this piece of
paper before it melts
This having been done the three friends hastily threw off their clothes
and scrambled into bed forgetting all about the proposed race in their
eagerness to form some plan for an immediate retaliation on the
occupants of the Maintop
I wonder if theyll hear anything of the ghost again this term said
Mugford
What ghost asked Diggory
Oh its nothing really answered Vance only somebody said once
that the house is haunted and Kennedy and Jacobs say the ghost must be
in the big attic next their room  They hear such queer noises sometimes
that they both go under the bedclothes
Do they always do that
Yes so they say whenever there is a row
Well then said Diggory Ill tell you what well do well go very
quietly up into that attic and groan and knock on the wall until you
think theyve both got their heads well under the clothes and then
well rush in and bag their pillows or drag them out of bed or
something of that sort  You arent afraid to go into the attic are
you he continued seeing that the others hesitated  Why of course
there are no such things as ghosts  Or look here Ill go in and
you can wait outside
Nno I dont mind answered Vance and itll be an awful lark
catching them with their heads under the clothes
All right then lets do it though I suppose wed better wait till
every ones in bed
The last suggestion was agreed upon and the three friends lay talking
in an undertone until the sound of footsteps and the gleam of a candle
above the door announced the fact that Mr Blake was retiring to rest
Hes always last said Vance we must give him time to undress and
then well start
A quarter of an hour later the three boys in semiundress were
creeping in single file up the narrow staircase
Be careful whispered Vance there are several loose boards and they
crack like anything
The small landing was reached in safety and the moon shining faintly
through a little skylight formed of a single pane of glass enabled them
to distinguish the outline of two doors
Now it was a very different matter when lying warm and snug in bed to
talk about acting the ghost from what it was when standing shivering
in the cold and darkness to put the project into execution  During the
period of waiting the conversation had turned on haunted houses and no
one seemed particularly anxious to claim as it were the post of honour
and be the first to enter the big attic
Go on whispered Mugford nudging Vance
Go on repeated the latter giving Diggorys arm a gentle push
The new boy had certainly undertaken to play the part of the ghost and
there was no excuse for his backing out of it at the last moment
All right he muttered Ill go
Just then a terrible thing happened  Diggory clutched the doorknob as
though it were the handle of a galvanic battery while Mugford and Vance
seized each other by the arm and literally gasped for breath
The stillness had been broken by a slight sound as of something falling
inside the attic and this was followed a moment later by a shrill
unearthly scream
For five seconds the three companions stood petrified with horror not
daring to move then followed another scream if anything more horrible
than the last and accompanied this time by the clanking rattle of a
chain being dragged across the floor
That was enough  Talk about a sauve qui peut the wonder is that any
one survived the stampede which followed  The youngsters turned and
flew down the stairs at breakneck speed and hardly had they started
when the door of the Maintop was flung open and its two occupants
rushed down after them  As though to ensure the retreat being nothing
less than a regular rout Mugford who was leading missed his footing
on the last step causing every one to fall over him in turn until all
five boys were sprawling together in a mixed heap upon the floor
Freeing themselves with some little difficulty from the general
entanglement they rose to their feet and after surveying each other
for a moment in silence gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of
The ghost
What were you fellows doing up there asked Kennedy
Why we came up to have a joke with you answered Vance but just
when we got up to the landing itit made that noise
There was the sound of the key turning in the lock of Mr Blakes door
Cave whispered Mugford
Tell him about it added Vance and giving Diggory a push they all
three darted into their room just as the master emerged from his
arrayed in dressinggown and slippers
Now then exclaimed the latter holding his candle above his head
and peering down the passage whats the meaning of this disturbance
I thought the whole house was falling downCome here you two and
explain yourselves
Please sir answered Kennedy and Jacobs in one breath its the
ghost
The ghost  What ghost  What dyou mean
The two Maintop men began a hasty account of the cause of their
sudden fright taking care however to make no mention of the three
hostile visitors who had shared in the surprise
Mr Blake listened to their story in silence then all at once he burst
out laughing and without a word turned on his heel and went quickly
upstairs  He entered the attic and in about half a minute they heard
him coming back
Ha ha  Ive got your ghost Ive been trying to lay him for some time
past
The jingle of a chain was distinctly audible Mr Blake was evidently
bringing the spectre down in his arms  Diggory and Vance could no
longer restrain their curiosity they hopped out of bed and glanced
round the corner of the door  The master held in his hand a rusty old
gin the iron jaws of which were tightly closed upon the body of an
enormous rat
Theres a monster for you he said I think its the biggest I ever
saw  Hed carried the trap chain and all right across the room but
that finished him he was as dead as a stone when I picked him up
Now get back to bed I should think youre both nearly frozen
Diggory and Jack Vance followed the advice given to Kennedy and Jacobs
and did so rather sheepishly  They felt they had been making tools of
themselves yet it would never have done to own to such a thing
What a lark said the new boy after a few moments silence
Wasnt it returned Jack Vance its the best joke Ive had for a
long time  But we didnt pay those fellows out for throwing those
snowballs we must do it some other night  And now we three must swear
to be friends and stand by each other against all the world and
whatever happens  What shall we call our room
I know answered Diggory well call it The Triple Alliance
CHAPTER II
THE PHILISTINES
The Triple Alliance the formation of which has just been described was
destined to be no mere form of speech or empty display of friendship
The members had solemnly sworn to stand by one another whatever
happened and the manner in which they carried out their resolve and
the important consequences which resulted from their concerted actions
will be made known to the reader as our story progresses
Poor Mugford certainly seemed likely to be a heavy drag on the
association he was constantly tumbling into trouble and needing to be
pulled out again by those who had promised to be his friends
An instance of this occurred on the day following Diggorys arrival at
The Birches  He and Vance had gone down after morning school into what
was called the playroom to partake of two more of the latters
mincepies and on their return to the schoolroom found a crowd
assembled round Acton who seated on the top of a small cupboard which
always served as a judicial bench was hearing a case in which Mugford
was the defendant while Jacobs and another boy named Cross appeared as
plaintiffs
The charge was that the former was indebted to the latter for the sum of
half a crown which he had borrowed towards the end of the previous
term in separate amounts of one shilling and eighteen pence promising
to repay them with interest immediately after the holidays  The money
had been expended in the purchase of a disreputable old canary bird for
which Noaks the manservant had agreed to find board and lodging during
the Christmas vacation  Now when the creditors reminded Mugford of his
obligations they found him totally unable to meet their demands for
payment
Now look here said Acton addressing the defendant with great
severity no humbughow much money did you bring back with you
Well I had to pay my brother before I came away for my share in a
telescope we bought last summer and then
Bother your brother and the telescope  Why cant you answer my
question How much money did you bring back with you
Only five bob
Then why in the name of Fortune dont you pay up
Because I had to pay all that to Noaks for birdseed
Dyou mean to say that that bird ate five shillings worth of seed in
four weeks
Well so Noaks says he told me hed kept scores of birds in his time
but hed never seen one so hearty at its grub before  Those were the
very words he used and he said it was eating nearly all the day and
thats one reason why it looks such a dowdy colour and never sings
Well all I can say is if you believe all Noaks tells you youre a
fool  But thats no reason why these two chaps should be done out of
their money so now how are you going to pay them
If they only wait till pocketmoneys given out began Mugford
Oh no we shant interrupted Cross  He only gets sixpence a week
and hes always breaking windows and other things and having it
stopped
There seemed only one way out of the difficulty and that was to put as
it were an execution into Mugfords desk and realize a certain amount
of his private property
Look here said Acton he must sell somethingNow then he added
turning to the defendant just shell out something and bring it here at
once and well have an auction
The boy walked off to his desk and after rummaging about in it for some
little time returned with a miscellaneous collection of small articles
in his arms which he proceeded to hand up one by one for the judges
inspection
Whats this
Oh its a book that was given me on my birthday called Lofty Thoughts
for Little Thinkers
Lofty grandmother said Acton impatiently
What else have you got
Well heres a wire puzzle only I think a bit of its lost and the
clasp of a cricket belt and old Dick Rodmans chessboard and some of
the men and some stuff for chilblains and
Oh dry up interrupted Acton what bosh  Who dyou expect would buy
any of that rubbish  Look here well give you till after dinner and
unless you find something sensible by then we shall come and hunt for
ourselves
Thats just like Mug said Jack Vance to Diggory as the group of boys
slowly dispersed hes always doing something stupid  But I suppose as
we made that alliance we ought to try to help the beggar somehow
They followed their unfortunate comrade to his desk which when opened
displayed a perfect chaos of ragged books loose sheets of paper broken
penholders pieces of string battered cardboard boxes and other
rubbish
Look here Mug what have you got to sell youll have to fork out
something
I dont know returned the other mournfully stirring up the contents
of the desk as though he were making a Christmas pudding  Ive got
nothing exceptwell theres this book of Poes Tales of Adventure
Mystery and Imagination and my claspknife and perhaps some one
would buy these fretsaw patterns or this dogchain
He turned out two or three more small articles and laid them on the
form
Are there any of these things you particularly wish to keep asked
Diggory because if so Vance and Ill bid for them and then you can
buy them back from us again when youve got some more money
Thats awfully kind of you answered Mugford brightening up  Ill
tell you what I should like to keep and thats my claspknife and the
book theyre such jolly stories  The Pit and the Pendulum always
gives me bad dreams and The Premature Burial makes you feel certain
youll be buried alive
All right and did you bring a cake back with you
Yes
Well then sell that first and you can share our grub
The auction was held directly after dinner  The cake fetched a
shilling and Diggory and Vance bid ninepence each for the book and
pocketknife so Mugford came out of his difficulty without suffering
any further loss than what was afterwards made good again by the
generosity of his two comrades  They for their part made no fuss over
this little act of kindness but handed the book and claspknife over
to Mugford without waiting for the money and little thinking what an
important part these trifling possessions would play in the subsequent
history of the Triple Alliance
The sale had not long been concluded and the little community were
preparing to obey Actons order to Come outside when the latter
rushed into the room finning with rage
I say he exclaimed what do you think that beast of a Noaks has
done  Why hes gone and put ashes all over our slide
In their heart of hearts every one felt decidedly relieved at this
announcement still it was necessary at all events to simulate some of
their leaders wrath and accordingly there was a general outcry against
the offender
Oh the cadWhat an awful shameLets tell Blake etc etc
Who is Noaks asked Diggory  Is he that sourlooking man who brings
the boots in every morning
Yes thats so answered Vance  He hates us allpartly I believe
because his sons a Philistine  I wonder old Welsby doesnt get another
man
His sons a what asked Diggory but at that moment Acton came
marching round the room ordering every one out into the playground and
Jack Vance hurried off to get his cap and muffler without replying to
the question
Sliding was out of the question and the House of Lords having amused
themselves for a time by capturing small boys and throwing them into the
snowdrift some one remarked that it would be good fun to build a snow
man which proposition was received with acclamation and all hands were
soon hard at work rolling the big balls which were to form the base of
the statue  As the work progressed the interest in it increased the
more so when Diggory suggested that the figure should be supposed to
represent the obnoxious Noaks and that the company could then relieve
their feelings by pelting his effigy as soon as it was completed
Every one was pleased with the project and even Acton who as a rule
would never follow up any plan which was not of his own making took
special pains to cause the snow man to bear some likeness to the
original  He had just by way of a finishing touch expended nearly
half a penny bottle of red ink in a somewhat exaggerated reproduction of
the fiery hue of Noakss nose when the bell rang for afternoon school
