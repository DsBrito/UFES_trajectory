Section 4  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate
International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks online payments and credit card donations

Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works
Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility
httpwwwgutenbergorg
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenbergtm
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks
