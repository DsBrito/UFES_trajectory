THE TALE OF SNOWBALL LAMB
I
BLACK AND WHITE
Hurrah Johnnie Green shouted And he dashed out of the woodshed and
ran to the barnyard as fast as he could scamper
There was a good reason for his high spirits and his haste His father
had just told him he might have a lamb for a pet
Farmer Green followed Johnnie at a slower pace When he reached the
barnyard fence Johnnie was already on the other side of it trying to
catch a certain black lamb
Now Johnnie Green was spry but this black lamb was sprier Whenever
Johnnie thought he had the lamb the black rascal always managed to slip
out of his clutches
Ill help you said Farmer Green And climbing the fence he soon had
the lively lamb cornered and caught
Then Johnnie lost no time in taking his new pet in his own arms
Im going to call him Johnnie began as his father let go of the
struggling black armful
But Johnnie Green never finished what he had started to say The first
thing he knew the lamb had squirmed out of his arms and was running up
the lane
Johnnie straightened up and gazed after him in dismay
I dont believe Ill call him anything he murmured half to himself
Farmer Green couldnt help laughing And then noticing a very
disappointed look on Johnnies face he said Cheer up Johnnie That
lamb is the youngest one on the farm but hes too big for a pet Hes a
wild one Let him run with the flock and well see if we cant do
something to make you feel happy
Well Johnnie Green knew that when his father talked like that it was
silly to be glum So he cried All right And turning his back upon
the black lamb which was by this time almost up to the head of the
lane Johnnie walked back to the woodshed
The next day when Farmer Green came home from a drive over the hill
Johnnie shouted Hurrah once more For lying on a bit of hay in the
bottom of the buggy was a white lamb no more than half as big as the
lively black scamp that had got away from Johnnie the day before
Johnnie Green didnt need to ask whose lamb this was He knew at once
that it was his own
Whered you get him he demanded
At your uncles his father explained
Johnnie lifted the white lamb out of the buggy and set him down gingerly
upon the ground And the white lamb didnt try to run off He was only a
tiny thing with a very soft coat and a very pink nose
I wonder if hes hungry said Johnnie Green Ill get some corn and
see if he wants anything
Youll have to feed him milk in a bottle his father told him He
isnt weaned yet Bring him into the woodshed
In a little while Johnnies father had found a babys bottle which he
filled with warm milk
Then all Johnnie had to do was to hold the bottle to his new pets
mouth The lamb did the rest
Im going to call him Snowball Johnnie announced And then he began
to laugh
Look at his tail he shouted Hell switch it off if he isnt
careful
For as Snowball drank the milk he jerked his stubby tail up and down at
a great rate
Old dog Spot who was stretched upon the woodshed threshold gazed at
Snowball with a lofty air
That lamb has a queer notion of the way a tail ought to be wagged he
said deep down in his throat He ought to wag it from side to side But
I suppose hes too young to know better
II
A RIDE TO TOWN
Much to old dog Spots disgust Johnnie Green and his new pet lamb soon
became great friends It wasnt long before Snowball as Johnnie called
the white lamb followed his young master about the yard and even into
the farmhousewhen Mrs Green wasnt looking
It was a remark that Johnnie made about Snowball one day which caused
old Spot to speak his mind plainly to the Muley Cow Johnnie Green
actually said in Spots hearing Snowball knows as much as a dog
I never did have any use for sheep Spot told the Muley Cow
Everybody knows theyre all terribly stupid So you can imagine how I
felt when Johnnie Green spoke like that to his father
The Muley Cow chewed her cud She had a faroff look in her eyes as if
she might be thinking about what Spot was sayingor as if she might
not Anyhow she did not speak
And to think Spot growledto think how I used to take care of
Johnnie when he was no more than a baby Do you suppose this lamb could
take care of a baby Do you suppose hed pull a baby out of the mill
pond Or fight off a bull Or kill a snake
The Muley Cow turned her calm face upon Spot
If youre jealous she began
Jealous Spot barked Of course Im not jealous But I must say that
this Snowball Lamb is very displeasing to me
Then why dont you the Muley Cow began again
I would Spot interrupted I wouldonly Im not a sheepkiller And
I dont intend to become one
This boy said the Muley Cow hell grow tired of that lamb The
other boys will begin to tease him because the lamb follows him about
And that will be too much for Johnnie    I know boys the Muley
Cow declared
Old dog Spot sighed I hope youre not mistaken he remarked Time
will tell Just now anybody can see that Johnnie Green is simply crazy
about that silly new pet of his
It was only a few days later that something happened to cause old dog
Spot to lose all hope
Johnnie Green and his father hitched up the old horse Ebenezer and
started for the village Of course Spot would have followed them under
the wagon if he had been at the barn when they left But he wasnt He
was up in the pasture chasing woodchucks
Just as old Ebenezer turned the corner at the foot of the hill Johnnie
Green happened to look back And there was Snowball following a little
way behind them
Of course it would never do to let him run all the way to the village
and back And Farmer Green didnt want to turn around and take Snowball
home So Johnnie Green jumped down and lifted Snowball into the wagon
So he rode to the village and then rode home again
Johnnie Green was greatly pleased by the whole affair And Snowball was
pleased too As soon as he reached the farmyard he began talking about
his trip to the village
Everybody listened to Snowball with wonder That is everybody wondered
except Henrietta Hen She began talking in a shrill voice about her
visit to the county fair And she said spitefully to Snowball Youd
better get out of the way before old dog Spot comes back from the
pasture
III
MRS HEN TELLS TALES
Old dog Spot came home from the pasture feeling quite pleased with
himself He had caught a fat woodchuck And that was enough to make him
happy
Spot hadnt crossed the barnyard when Henrietta Hen came fluttering up
to him She was a busybody always trying to get somebody into trouble
Snowball went to the village with Johnnie Green and his father
Henrietta shrieked
Thats good news said old dog Spot Ive been hoping to hear
something like that Were well rid of that Snowball Lamb
Oh But they brought him back with them Henrietta Hen explained
Spots face fell Thats a pity he said
Henrietta Hen peered into Spots face There was something that she
couldnt understand
Why arent you angry she inquired in her highpitched voice Dont
you realize that Snowball tried to follow the wagon to the village To
be sure they picked him up down at the corner But I want you to know
that he tried to take your place
At that old Spot let out a howl of rage
Ill never go woodchuck hunting again he cried Things have come to
a pretty pass if I cant leave the farmyard for a few hours without
having a lamb insult me like that
Henrietta Hen was pleased
I thought youd want to know what had happened she remarked And now
I must add that Snowball has been boasting about his trip Of course
his journey was nothing compared with my visit to the county fair last
year But I dont like to hear a lamb telling about his travels Cant
you put a stop to it
Old dog Spot shook his head
For once he said slowly I cant help wishing I was a sheepkiller
Well said Henrietta you know you could try
Its not a question of trying Spot told her My family isnt a
sheepkilling one I have to live up to the family name
Well Henrietta Hen declared if I were you Id join another
familyat least for a short time
But old dog Spot declared that that wouldnt do at all Well have to
be patient he said The Muley Cow claims that Johnnie Green will get
tired of Snowball sooner or later It may be that she is right Let us
hope so
Farmer Green ought to turn that great lamb into the pasture Henrietta
Hen spluttered
That was exactly what Mrs Green herself thought
Your lamb cant come into my kitchen she called at that very moment
For Johnnie Green was just then entering the doorway with Snowball at
his heels
Thank goodness Spot barked theres one person on this farm who has
some sense If it wasnt for Mrs Green Id be tempted to run away
As Johnnie Green closed the door behind him leaving Snowball upon the
stone step Snowball gave a plaintive baaaa
Ugh cackled Henrietta Hen Did you ever hear such a silly sound in
all your life
IV
SCHOOL BEGINS
After Snowballs trip to the village old dog Spot scarcely stirred from
the farmyard He left the woodchucks to scurry about the pasture as they
pleased For he felt that he ought to keep an eye on Snowball
The very next time that Snowball started to follow Johnnie Green out of
the yard Spot ran up to him and barked at his heels Go back Spot
growled Dont you dare leave this yard
And then to Spots surprise Johnnie Green picked up a stick and
threatened him with it
You let my lamb alone Johnnie cried That was bad enough according
to old dog Spots notion But when Johnnie shouted Get out at him
that was worse
Spot tucked his tail between his legs and slunk away to hide himself
under the woodshed And there he stayed for the rest of the morning and
sulked
But in the afternoon he began to feel more cheerful For Spot had heard
Mrs Green remark that school began the next day
That was good news At least Spot so thought it
This lamb wont get much notice from Johnnie Green after today Spot
told Henrietta Hen Hell be left here in the yard And it wont be
long now before Mrs Green tells Farmer Green to put him in the pasture
with the flock She wont have him in everybodys way Shell get rid
of him quickly You know that when Mrs Green makes up her mind things
generally happen to suit her
Henrietta nodded her handsome head
Just what Ive often told the Rooster she exclaimed
Well the following morning as much as an hour after breakfast Johnnie
Green started up the road with some books under his arm and a lunch
basket in his hand It was the first day of school And somehow Johnnie
wasnt feeling very happy He had dawdled about the houseso his mother
said It appeared that he was in no hurry to leave home
Before Johnnie had reached the barn which stood beside the road Mrs
Green stepped out of the house and looked at him
Youd better get along she called after him You dont want to be
late the first day of school
So Johnnie Green fell into a jog trot which he kept up all the way to
the red schoolhouse
As he came in sight of the little boxlike building he saw other
youngsters hurrying through the doorway And then Johnnie ran as fast as
he could
He burst inside the schoolroom just as the school mistress tapped the
little bell on her desk which meant that everybody must stop talking
because school had begun Johnnie Green hurried to a seat But before he
reached it all the other pupils burst into a shout
Johnnie looked around And there trotting across the floor was
Snowball He had followed Johnnie all the way from Farmer Greens barn
It was some time before things were quiet The teacher had to ring her
little bell a good many times and even rap upon her desk with a ruler
before the boys and girls stopped laughing And then the teacher turned
to Johnnie Green and spoke to him
Mary she said Is this your little lamb
The teacher seemed surprised because her pupils began to roar at that
But she made no attempt to silence them She did not even try to quiet a
certain boy called Red who made more noise than all the rest
together
Meanwhile Johnnie Greens face looked like a great red apple And it
grew several shades redder when Snowball walked up to his seat and stood
close beside him
Dont you think said the teacher after a whiledont you think
Mary that youd better take your little lamb home
Johnnie Green did not answer But he hung his head as he rose and
hurried out of the schoolroom with Snowball following close behind him
Once outside Johnnie could hear the children still laughing And he even
thought that he could hear the teacher laughing too
That very morning Snowball found himself turned into the pasture where
Farmer Greens flock of sheep were passing the summer And it wasnt
long before the whole barnyard was filled with the noise of gossiping
tongues
For once said Henrietta Hen the Muley Cow knew what she was talking
about when she said Johnnie Green would grow tired of that white lamb
As for old dog Spot he told everybody that he was going up to the
pasture to chase woodchucks
And as for Johnnie Green he told his mother that he didnt believe hed
go back to school any more
But she said he should and that very morning
And things generally happened the way Mrs Green intended
V
THE PROMISED TREAT
Snowball wasnt sorry that Johnnie Green had turned him into the
pasture He found the pasture a delightful place He had plenty of
company for there was a whole flock of sheep with him And not only did
he soon become acquainted with them He met other folk such as Billy
Woodchuck and Jimmy Rabbit and old Mr Crow And though some of the
older sheep paid scant heed to so young a lamb as Snowball Mr Crow
often went out of his way to stop and talk with him
That was because Mr Crow loved a bit of gossip And he was willing to
chat with anybody on the chance of picking up some interesting morsel
of news
Were going to have a treat Snowball informed old Mr Crow one day
The old gentleman cocked his head on one side and looked at Snowball
How do you know you are he demanded He was a great one for asking
questions
The Muley Cow told me Snowball explained Down in the barn she heard
Farmer Green tell Johnnie about it
Ah ha cried Mr Crow Ill have to keep an eye on things If
theres going to be a treat I must get my share of it    Wheres
it going to bewhere do you expect to have this treat
Right here in this pasture
Thats good Mr Crow exclaimed Im glad of that I can enjoy it
then I feared it might be in the barn And I like plenty of room if
Im to enjoy a treat properly
Snowball began to feel a bit uneasy
The Muley Cow didnt say anything about your being invited he
blurted In fact she said that this treat was for us sheep only
Dont you worry about that the old gentleman assured him I know
well enough that if Farmer Green didnt mention inviting me it was
because he forgot it I know he wouldnt like it if I stayed away
Snowball began to wish he hadnt mentioned the treat to Mr Crow But
the secret was out And when Mr Crow asked when the treat was going to
be Snowball confessed that the Muley Cow had told him the flock would
enjoy it that very day
Ah said Mr Crow with a smirk Then I must stay where I can see
whats going on So Im going to sit in that tall elm over by the stone
wall When I see the sheep begin to bunch together Ill join you at
once    Please bleat three times when the treat is ready for I might
be dozing
I will Snowball promised
And then Mr Crow got ready to fly away
By the way he said pausing whats the treat to be
The Muley Cow said she heard Farmer Green tell Johnnie to salt the
sheep today Snowball explained
To his great surprise old Mr Crow let out a deafening squawk when he
heard that bit of news
Then Ill keep as far away from the pasture as I can get he cried
VI
MR CROW EXPLAINS
Snowball couldnt understand old Mr Crows rage Mr Crow had invited
himself to the treat that Johnnie Green was going to give the flock But
the moment the old gentleman heard that the treat was going to be salt
he had squalled at the top of his hoarse voice that he was going to stay
as far from the pasture as he could get
Whats the matter Snowball asked Mr Crow Dont you like salt
Mr Crow made a wry face
No I dont he spluttered
Well just because you dont happen to care for salt is no reason for
your being so angry Snowball told him
And then Mr Crow almost took his breath away
I agree with you he said gruffly And Mr Crow was a person who was
never known to agree with anybody So that was an astonishing remark for
him to make
Then I suppose youll get over being angry at once Snowball
ventured
I wont Mr Crow thundered And take a bit of advice young fellow
Dont go near the salting party It will be dangerous he added darkly
Why will it be dangerous Snowball inquired
The old gentleman shook his head and put on a very wise look
I dont believe youve ever been at a salting party he said
And Snowball confessed that he hadnt
Whereat Mr Crow nodded his head up and down several times and looked
even wiser than before
Its lucky for you my lad that you told me about this affair he
declared For Im going to keep you out of a peck of trouble Dont you
go near the party Keep just as far away from it as you can When you
see Johnnie Green come inside the pasture you scramble over the stone
wall and hide And now he shook his head
Its a pity he sigheda pity you cant fly or climb a tree
He was so gloomy that Snowball couldnt help feeling uncomfortable And
all he could manage to say was one word which he had hard work to
stammer out It was Wwwhy
Because its just a trick Mr Crow explained Its a trick to catch
you This trick of salting the sheep is as old as the hills But I
suppose youre so young you never have happened to hear of it I must
say he added Im surprised that the Muley Cow didnt take the
trouble to tell you all about it
Maybe shes too young to know about it too Snowball suggested
Young Mr Crow cried with a short mirthless laugh The Muley Cows
not young Shes the oldest cow on the farm If the truth must be told
shes so old that Farmer Green wouldnt keep her if it werent that
Johnnie Green thinks she belongs to him And hed raise a terrible row
if his father sold her
Are you too young to explain about this trick that you just warned me
against Snowball asked Id like to know how there can be any danger
in salt How can anybody be caught with salt
Well you are a silly cried Mr Crow Cant you guess that Johnnie
Green is going to put salt on everybodys tail
VII
WARNING THE FLOCK
Snowball Lamb was puzzled He didnt understand old Mr Crows answer at
all
What if Johnnie Green should put salt on my tail he asked Mr Crow
What harm would that do
The old gentleman stared at Snowball as if he couldnt quite believe
that anybody could be so stupid
Havent you ever heard that thats the way to catch people cried Mr
Crow at last Why there isnt a boy in Pleasant Valley who doesnt
know that and many of em carry salt about in their pockets all the
time hoping to get a chance some day to put the salt on my tail and
capture me Mr Crows bright eyes snapped And his bill snapped too
For the mere thought of such scheming always made him terribly angry
And then Snowball said something that made Mr Crow more impatient than
ever
I dont care if Johnnie Green does catch me Snowball declared
Johnnie wouldnt hurt me Weve always been great friends
He wouldnt eh Mr Crow retorted How do you know he wouldnt hurt
you
He never has hurt me Snowball replied
Perhaps not Perhaps not Mr Crow croaked But you never can tell
You never can tell what a boy will do And if you go to the salting
party and get into trouble dont say I didnt warn you As the old
fellow flew off he looked as if all the cares in the world were weighing
him down Snowball noticed that he flew heavily It took a great amount
of flapping of his broad wings to lift him out of the pasture And when
he was well up in the air he gave a glum caw caw as he wheeled and
sailed away down the wind
Well Snowball couldnt help being somewhat disturbed by Mr Crows
grave actions and his graver remarks I wonder thought Snowball if
Mr Crow knows what hes talking about Ill ask the flock
So Snowball ran down the hillside pasture to the place where the flock
had gathered to graze And to his astonishment some of the flock didnt
even lift their heads from the grass when he related all that Mr Crow
had said Those that did pause and listen to Snowball only giggled and
went to feeding again No there was one that spoke to him Aunt Nancy
Ewe spoke up a bit tartly
If youre worried youd better stay away when Johnnie Green comes to
salt us she told him We all expect to have a very pleasant time
she added
Have you ever had salt put on your tail Snowball asked the old lady
Certainly not she snapped And she glared at Snowball so fiercely
that he fell back several steps Are you trying to insult me she
cried
He did not answer It was plain to him that Aunt Nancy didnt know
anything about the trick of putting salt on ones tail Yes Mr Crow
must be wiser than she was
Theyll all get into trouble Snowball thought And then he said
something that was almost exactly like what Mr Crow had said to him
They cant say I didnt warn them
VIII
SALTING THE SHEEP
Snowball Lamb stood in the pasture apart from the rest of the flock
Aunt Nancy Ewe had returned to her grazing And not one of her
companions acted as if some dreadful peril hung over him Nobody would
have thought to look at the flock that they were about to have salt
put on their tails But Snowball knew that it was so Far down the
valley he could hear old Mr Crows warning caw caw telling him
again to beware of Johnnie Green
And just then Johnnie squirmed through the pasture bars and pulled a
sack after him Presently he began to call to the sheep And Snowball
watched while they went one and all on a dead run towards the bars
Then Snowball turned and ran the other way straight for the stone wall
He didnt even look back once but scrambled over the wall and lost
himself in the tangle of berry bushes that grew in a rocky old pasture
that hadnt been used for years
Hes salting them by this time Snowball muttered to himself Johnnie
Green is salting the sheep And Im glad Mr Crow warned me for I
shouldnt want salt put on my tail It must be terrible to be caught
that way
Whats that youre saying said a lively voice nearby
Snowball leaped back then stood still and stared at a pair of antlers
which stuck up from behind a berry bush
The antlers rose a little higher And then Snowball saw the face of
Nimble Deer beneath them
What were you murmuring about salt Nimble inquired pleasantly
Johnnie Green is salting the sheep over in our pasture Snowball
explained
He is eh cried Nimble Deer Then why arent you there with the
rest
Snowball shook his head
Its too dangerous he said I dont want salt put on my tail
Nimble Deer gave him a queer look
It is dangerous while Johnnie Green is thereor it would be dangerous
if he had a gun Nimble admitted But whats this you say about salt
on your tail
Johnnie Green is putting salt on the tail of every sheep in the flock
Snowball declared
Thats odd said Nimble Ill have to look into this matterafter
Johnnie Green has left the pasture
Snowball did not follow Nimble as he moved nearer the stone wall But he
stood still and watched Presently he saw Nimble leap the wall After
that Snowball could no longer see him
It was some time later when Nimble jumped back over the wall and landed
lightly on the ledge that ran alongside it And Snowball noticed that
his face wore a very cheerful look
Well said Snowball
That was as good salt as I ever tasted Nimble remarked running his
tongue over his lips If you hurry youll be able to get a taste even
now
Ive never eaten any salt said Snowball
Then hurry by all means cried Nimble Deer You dont know what
youre missing
Has Johnnie gone Snowball inquired
Long ago
I suppose he spilled some of the salt on the ground said Snowball
You know hes a very careless boy
He spilled heaps of it Nimble Deer replied But the sheep are eating
it fast
Well Snowball was puzzled How could the sheep be eating salt if
Johnnie Green had caught them It was more than he could understand But
if Nimble Deer had been with themand come back safelythere couldnt
be any great danger
So Snowball hurried over the stone wall and scampered down to the place
near the bars where the flock still lingered
As Snowball joined them he saw that they were all busily eating
something white that lay in little piles upon the ground
He tasted of the stuff carefully It was delicious And wasting no more
time he gobbled up all of the salt that he could get
When it was gone Snowball turned to old Aunt Nancy Ewe
May I lick the salt off your tail he asked her politely
She gave him a haughty stare
Have you no respect for your elders Aunt Nancy asked him severely
Pardon me said Snowball Maybe Im mistaken but Mr Crow told
me
