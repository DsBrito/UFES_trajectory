PREFACE
The language which I have endeavoured to illustrate in the following
pages is the Malay of the British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca
some knowledge of which I have had the opportunity of acquiring during
sixteen yearsa service in Penang Province Wellesley Malacca
Singapore and Perak
Dialectical peculiarities are so abundant in Malay that it is impossible
to teach the colloquial language of the people without imparting to the
lesson the distinct marks of a particular locality In parts of India it
is said proverbially that in every twelve kos there is a variation in
the language1 and very much the same might be said of the Malay
Peninsula and adjacent islands The construction of the language and the
general body of words remain of course the same but in every state or
subdivision of a state there are peculiar words and expressions and
variations of accent and pronunciation which belong distinctively to it
Words common in one district sound strangely in another or it may be
they convey different meanings in the two places Even words of such
constant occurrence as the personal pronouns aIa and ayoua vary
according to locality The Kedah accent is easily distinguished from
that of Patani and that again from the speech of Trengganu and Pahang
Certain expressions common in Penang are almost unintelligible in
Malacca and Singapore and vice versA In Perak it is not difficult to
say whether a man comes from the upper or lower reaches of the river by
merely noting particular words in his conversation Even individual
villages and districts have their peculiar twang or their tricks of
expression not found elsewhere In Java Sumatra and other islands
eastward in which Malay is spoken the pronunciation and character of
the language are much influenced by the other languages current there
Malay is only spoken in perfection in places where the natives speak no
other tongue

Native pedantry has endeavoured to classify various styles of speaking
as the court style bahasa dalam the wellbred style bahasa
bangsawan the traderas language bahasa dagang and the mixed
language bahasa kachaukan but all that can be correctly said is
that a limited number of words are used exclusively in intercourse with
royal personages that persons of good birth and education in the
Eastern Archipelago as elsewhere select their expressions more
carefully than the lower classes and that the vocabulary of commerce
does not trouble itself with the graces of style and the copious use of
Arabic words which commend themselves to native writers
The written language is more stilted and less terse and idiomatic than
the colloquial dialect and even where pure Malay is employed the
influence of Arabic compositions is very marked Whole sentences
sometimes though clothed in excellent Malay are unacknowledged
translations of Arabic phrases This may be verified by any one well
acquainted with Malay literary compositions who will look into a really
good translation of an Arabic work for instance Laneas translation of
the aThousand and One Nightsa The Malay speaks much better than he
writes and has at his command quantities of words which never find
their way into his literature and therefore but rarely into
dictionaries compiled by Europeans
The spelling of Malay words in the native character is hardly yet fixed
though the PersoArabic alphabet has been in use since the thirteenth
century and those follow but a vain shadow who seek to prescribe exact
modes of spelling words regarding which even native authorities are not
agreed and of which the pronunciation may vary according to locality
The experience of Crawfurd sufficiently proves this there are words in
his dictionary which are transliterated in as many as four different
ways
Two classes of works in his own language have hitherto been at the
service of the English student of Malaygrammars more or less
scientifically arranged and vocabularies and books of dialogues which
presuppose some knowledge of grammatical construction
The Malay Grammar of Marsden is an admirable work of unquestionable
utility to the advanced student but it contains more than the beginner
wants to know Crawfurdas Malay Grammar too is hardly a work to put
into the hands of a beginner
Mere vocabularies on the other hand teach nothing but words and
sentences and throw no light upon forms of construction
It has been my aim to supply a work which will be at once an elementary
grammar and a compendium of words and sentences which will teach the
colloquial dialect and yet explain grammatical rules and for this I
have taken as my model the Hindustani Manual of the late Professor
Forbes
The language is not ennobled by having been the speech of men who have
made their mark in the worldas history The islands of Indonesia have
never startled the Eastern world with an Akbar or charmed it with a
Hafiz or a Chand Receptivity not originality is the characteristic of
the Malay races But the importance of Malay when the traveller heads
eastward from the Bay of Bengal has been recognised by Europeans since
the sixteenth century when Magellanas Malay interpreter was found to be
understood from one end of the Archipelago to the other It is the
strong and growing language of an interesting people and in the words
of a recent writer on Eastern languages afor Malay as for Hindustani
a magnificent future may be anticipated among the great speechmedia of
Asia and of the world They manifest that capacity for the absorption
and assimilation of foreign elements which we recognise as making
English the greatest vernacular that the world has ever seena2

INTRODUCTION
The interest of Englishmen in the Malay language began with the early
ventures of the East India Company in the Far East in the first years
of the seventeenth century It was the language of commerce everywhere
east of the Bay of Bengal and our earliest adventurers found it spoken
at the trading ports which they visited The Portuguese had preceded
them by a century and the Dutch had been a little earlier in the same
field Our countrymen seem to have been indebted to the latter for their
first Malay vocabulary The minutes of the East India Company record
how on the 22d January 1614 aa book of dialogues heretofore
translated into Latin by the Hollanders and printed with the Malacca
tongue Mr Hakluyt having now turned the Latin into English and
supposed very fit for the factors to learn was ordered to be printed
before the departure of the shipsa1
Footnote 1 Calendar of State Papers Colonial Series East
Indies p 272
At present the use of Malay as far as Englishmen are concerned is
chiefly confined to the officers of the Colonial Government in the
British possessions in the Straits of Malacca and in the native states
adjoining them and to other residents in those parts and in the Dutch
settlements in the East To these may be added the English communities
of Labuan and Sarawak and merchants traders and seamen all over the
Eastern Archipelago The limited extent of our Malay possessions when
they are compared with the magnificent islands which make up Netherlands
India excuse us no doubt for the secondary place which we occupy in
all researches connected with the language and literature of the Malays
To the Dutch their colonies in the Eastern seas are what our Indian
Empire is to us and with them the study of Malay Javanese Kawi c
takes the place of Persian Hindustani Tamil Sanskrit c which
occupy our civilians in India The extent and value of Dutch works on
Malay subjects is however but little known to Englishmen in the East
owing to their general ignorance of the Dutch language It is not too
much to say that any one aiming at a thorough knowledge of the language
literature and history of the Malay people should commence his task by
learning Dutch
Malay is the language not of a nation but of tribes and communities
widely scattered in the East and is probably spoken with greatest
purity in the states of Kedah and Perak on the west coast of the Malay
Peninsula It is spoken in all the states of the Peninsula in Sumatra
Sunda Java Borneo Celebes Flores Timor and Timor Laut the
Moluccas and the Philippines Traces of it are found among the numerous
Polynesian dialects and in the language of the islanders of Formosa
Siam proper has a large Malay population descendants mainly of captives
taken in war and the language is therefore in use there in places it
is found also here and there on the coasts and rivers of Anam and
CochinChina No other language of the Eastern Archipelago is understood
over such an extensive area and it is the common means of communication
between the numerous tribes and races of the Malay family whose
languages and dialects differ
Logan supposes that the earliest inhabitants of the Archipelago were
tribes of AfricoIndian origin who peopled the Eastern islands as well
as the more accessible portions of the Continent descendants of whom he
recognises in the negro and quasinegro tribes that are still preserved
in some of the mountains of the Malay Peninsula Siam and Anam To
these succeeded immigrant tribes from MidAsia by way of the Irawadi
whom Logan designates by the term of the TibetoAnam family all the
races and languages from Tibet to Anam being included under it aBy a
longcontinued influx this family spread itself over the Peninsula
Sumatra Java Borneo and Celebes but its farther progress over the
many islands to the north and east appears to have been checked by the
older races It was probably only by slow steps and by settling at many
points that it gained a firm footing even in the western islands and a
long period must have elapsed before its tribes became so populous and
spread so far into the interior as to enable them to absorb and destroy
the earlier occupantsa2 The variety which exists among the languages
and dialects in the region affected by these movements is thus accounted
for by Logan aThe languages imported by the TibetoAnamese settlers
differed as did those of the natives and the combinations formed in
different places from the contact of the two families varied in the
proportions of each which entered into them But the structures of the
native tongues had strong affinities amongst themselves and
predominated in all these new combinationsa3
Footnote 2 Journ Ind Arch iv 311
Footnote 3 Idem p 315
The idea presented by this sketch of the origin of the aboriginal Malay
language is that of a mixed dialect borrowing something from the
TibetoAnam languages the influence of which would be more apparent in
the western settlements and gradually approaching the AfricoIndian
forms farther east4 aLastlya Logan supposes aa later Indian
influence belonging to a far more advanced civilisation flowed in a
great stream into the Western Archipelago and cut off that of the
Irawadi before its linguistic operation had made much progressa5 It
is to this epoch that we must ascribe the introduction of the Sanskrit
element into the Malay language
Footnote 4 Journ Ind Arch v p 569
Footnote 5 Idem
Malay is mainly dissyllabic but there are not wanting evidences of a
former monosyllabic tendency The syllable bu bun or bung for
instance occurs in a considerable number of words conveying an idea of
roundness
Bulan      the moon
Bulat      round
Buah       fruit
Buyong     a jar
Butir      a grain globule
Busar      an arch
Bukit      a hill
Busut      an anthill
Buntar     round
Bunting    pregnant
Bunchit    potbellied
Buntut    the buttocks
Buntoh     a numeral affix implying rotundity
cf lAon Burmese used with such
words as chinchin a ring and kail
a fishhook
Bungkok    humpbacked
Bungkus    a bundle
Many others might be cited6
Footnote 6 These remarks do not of course affect foreign
words such as bumi and bujang derived from the Sanskrit
bhumi and bhujangga
Another characteristic list of words might be made compounded with the
monosyllable tang which in Sakai and Semang means ahanda and
conveying an idea of seizing or holding
Tangan      the hand
Tangkap     to seize
Tangkei     a stalk
Tanggong    to support
Tanggal     to drop off having left hold
Tongkat     a walkingstick c
The history of the Malay people is to be discovered in the language
itself for no authentic records of preMuhammadan times exist Just as
an insight into the early history of our own nation may be obtained by
analysing the component parts of the English tongue and assigning to
each of the languages which have contributed to make it what it is their
due proportion of influence so by resolving the Malay language into
its separate elements of which native Sanskrit and Arabic are the
chief and by examining the words contributed by each it is possible to
follow with some approach to historical accuracy the successive advances
which the Malay people have made on the path of civilisation
The aboriginal dialect prior to the admixture of Sanskrit must have
been but the poor vocabulary of men hardly raised above savage life The
purely native element in Malay furnishes all the necessary terms to
express the physical objects surrounding men leading a primitive life in
the forest and all that has to do with their food dwellings
agriculture fishing hunting and domestic affairs
The use of a Sanskrit word for aplougha seems to record a revolution in
agriculture The primitive cultivation of the Malays was carried on by
clearing and burning the hillsides a system still largely adopted in
native states where land is plentiful and timber valueless and the
cultivation of the wet ricefields of the plains which necessitates the
use of the plough would thus seem to have been resorted to only after
the arrival of the Hindus
As soon as the analysis reaches moral ideas or objects requiring some
advance in civilisation it is found that they are expressed by words of
foreign origin These are for the most part Sanskrit or Arabic The
latter require no notice here for they are of comparatively recent
introduction For the most part they consist of terms incidental to the
ethical and religious teaching of the Muhammadans The Arabic element in
Malay is not accurately determinable for new expressions are constantly
being introduced
A sketch of the Sanskrit element in Malay is all that there is space for
here
A careful classification of the principal Sanskrit words which are found
in Malay helps to indicate what must have been the condition of society
when the Aryan came into contact with the islanders of Sumatra It
shows independently of other proof that Hindu colonisation must have
gradually introduced the Malay races to institutions ideas pursuits
and wants to which they had hitherto been strangers Many of the
incidents of commerce most of the metals and precious stones the pomp
and ceremony of royalty and the use of the elephant are shown by the
Sanskrit nomenclature employed in describing them to be of Hindu
importation From this it is not difficult to infer the primitive
condition of a people to whom all these things were unknown So the
Sanskrit names of many weapons indicate a period when the rude weapons
of savage Malay tribesblowpipes spears cwere supplemented by
arms of a more formidable character for which they were indebted to
India Other groups of words show independently of other proof that
the Hindu religion was successfully planted among the Malays and
flourished for a time and that the monarchical form of government was
introduced in Malay countries by Hindu settlers and rulers
The word arulersa is used advisedly for the theory of Marsden as to the
manner of the introduction of Hinduism seems to possess greater claims
to general acceptance than that advocated by certain other writers
notably Leyden and Crawfurd Crawfurd asserted that the Sanskrit words
adopted in Malay came originally through the Hindu priesthood and that
the priests through whom this was effected belonged to the Telugu race
this in his opinion being the people who commencing by trading with
the Malays proceeded to partial settlement in their country and ended
by converting them to Hinduism and introducing the language and
literature of the Hindus He entirely discountenances the idea that
Sanskrit could have been introduced by a people of whom it was the
vernacular language7 He admits however that in Southern India
Sanskrit was itself a foreign tongue that Sanskrit has found its way
into Javanese and Malay in a state of comparative purity and not
intermixed with Telugu and that there is no trace whatever of any
extensive settlement of the Telugus in the Malay Archipelago
Footnote 7 Crawfurd Malay Grammar Dissertation xxxix xliii
Marsdenas contention on the other hand points to Gujarat as the
quarter from which Hindu civilisation penetrated to the far East and to
conquest as the mode in which the way was cleared for its
introduction8
Footnote 8 aInnovations of such magnitude we shall venture to
say could not have been produced otherwise than by the entire
domination and possession of these islands by some ancient Hindu
power and by the continuance of its sway during several ages Of
the period when this state of things existed we at present know
nothing and judging of their principles of action by what we
witness in these days we are at a loss to conceive under what
circumstances they could have exerted an influence in distant
countries of the nature here described The spirit of foreign
conquest does not appear to have distinguished their character and
zeal for the conversion of others to their own religious faith
seems to be incompatible with their tenets We may however be
deceived by forming our opinion from the contemplation of modern
India and should recollect that previously to the Mohametan
irruptions into the upper provinces which first took place about
the year 1000 and until the progressive subjugation of the
country by Persians and Moghuls there existed several powerful
and opulent Hindu states of whose maritime relations we are
entirely ignorant at present and can only cherish the hope of
future discoveries from the laudable spirit of research that
pervades and does so much honour to our Indian establishmentsa
Marsden Malay Grammar xxxii
Before proceeding to classify some of the Sanskrit words which are found
in Malay and to deduce any theories from their presence it is
necessary in order to avoid misconception to notice several
difficulties which cannot be overlooked
In the first place it is not meant to be asserted that the Malays have
obtained all the words enumerated further on direct from the people of
India All theories founded upon the presence of Sanskrit words in Malay
must apply with equal force to Javanese which contains a larger
proportion of Sanskrit words than Malay aSanskrit words are found in
greatest purity in the Javanese and next to it in the Malay their
corruption increasing as we recede from Java and Sumatraa9 It may be
assumed therefore that in addition to the influence which Hinduism
exerted among the Malays of Sumatra by means of direct intercourse with
India there was also a second source from which the Malays derived a
great portion of their Hindu nomenclature namely the ancient Hindu
kingdoms of Java10
Footnote 9 Crawfurd See also Marsden Malay Grammar xxxiii
Footnote 10 aThe Hindu religion and Sanskrit language were in
all probability earliest introduced in the western part of
Sumatra the nearest part of the Archipelago to the continent of
India Java however became eventually the favourite abode of
Hinduism and its language the chief recipient of Sanskrit
Through the Javanese and Malays Sanskrit appears to have been
disseminated over the rest of the Archipelago and even to the
Philippine Islands This is to be inferred from the greater number
of Sanskrit words in Javanese and Malayespecially in the first
of thesethan in the other cultivated languages from their
existing in greater purity in the Javanese and Malay and from the
errors of these two languages both as to sense and orthography
having been copied by all the other tongues An approximation to
the proportions of Sanskrit existing in some of the principal
languages will show that the amount constantly diminishes as we
recede from Java and Sumatra until all vestiges of it disappear
in the dialects of Polynesia In the ordinary written language of
Java the proportion is about 110 in 1000 in Malay 50 in the
Sunda of Java 40 in the Bugis the principal language of
Celebes 17 and in the Tagala one of the principal languages of
the Philippines about one and a halfa Crawfurd Malay

These remarks may be illustrated by reference to the fourth column of
the lists of words which follow
Again some of the Sanskrit words in the following lists are synonyms
merely there being native or Arabic words or both in common use to
express the same object
In some instances too the words quoted are not often heard in the
colloquial dialect but occur in books to which in many cases they have
been transplanted from Javanese romances
All these circumstances seriously modify the possibility of drawing
general conclusions from an analysis of the body of Sanskrit vocables
found in Malay The questions to be decided seem to be 1 whether it is
possible that such a mass of terms for common objects for they are by
no means confined to words incident to the Hindu religion could have
been imported into Malay by any means except by oral communication with
a Sanskritspeaking people 2 supposing that this could have been
effected through some later Indian dialect itself largely tinged with
Sanskrit as the Latin words in English came to us with the Norman
speech what dialect was this Telugu as Crawfurd thinks Gujarati to
which Marsden inclines or what
It is in order to contribute to the settlement of such questions as
these that a classification of some of the Sanskrit terms in Malay has
been attempted in this Introduction11 It is hoped that the subject
may attract the attention of those more competent to deal with it and
that the researches of Sanskrit scholars may facilitate a decision which
there is no pretension to pronounce here
Footnote 11 A selection of words only is given There are
numbers of Sanskrit words in Malay which have no place in these
lists
The centre of Hindu influence in Malay states would seem to have been
the court From the governing classes the use of Sanskrit expressions
would gradually spread among the people To this day there are certain
Sanskrit words which are applied to royalty alone there being native
equivalents when the nonprivileged classes are intended The words
putra and putrA afford an instance in point Meaning simply asona
and adaughtera in Sanskrit they have from the fact of Sanskrit
nomenclature having been affected at Malay courts come to mean
aprincea and aprincessa and are applied only to the sons and
daughters of rajas
At the chief seats of Hindu government there must have been Brahmans
conversant with the sacred writings whose teaching would gradually be
the means of introducing a taste for Hindu learning and literature
Bacha to read from bach to speak is Sanskrit but tulis to
write is a native word12 and surat a writing is Arabic
Language therefore in this instance does not throw much light on the
progress made by the Malays in the art of writing in the preMuhammadan
stage of their history Rockinscriptions found in Province Wellesley
and Singapore prove however that at some remote period an ancient
Indian character was known on the Peninsula13 though it was probably
confined to religious purposes
Footnote 12 Unless the Sansk root likh to write may be
detected in the second syllable
Footnote 13 Journal Royal As Soc Bengal vi 680 xvii part

Crawfurd writing in 1852 stated that Malay can be written or spoken
without the least difficulty without a word of Sanskrit or Arabic and
described the foreign elements in Malay as aextrinsic and
unessentiala14 But several words of the first necessity are Sanskrit
It would be difficult to speak Malay intelligibly while avoiding the
use of the relative pronouns yang Sansk yas ya yat who
which and mana Sansk mAna measure or of the common auxiliary
sudah Sansk Auddha15 pure acquitted which denotes the past
tense A long list might be made of common words not included in any of
the following groups which are almost pure Sanskrit such as bawa to
bring vaha bearing carrying kata to say kath to tell
talk biasa accustomed abhyAsa reflection langkah to step
stride langh to stride over kelahi to fight kalaha
quarrel and niala to blaze to burn jval Nor is the influence
of Sanskrit in Malay confined to words which have been adopted in
comparative purity An extension of the sphere of research reveals whole
groups of Malay words which seem to be formed from some Sanskrit root
and to retain to some extent its signification Thus the Sanskrit root
ju to push on impel may perhaps be detected in such words as
juwang to rush against jungur prominent a beak jungang
prominent of teeth juring sharp pointed jurus to pull
course direction juluk to thrust upwards julir a kind of
harpoon julur to wag to wriggle c
Footnote 14 Malay Grammar Dissertation vi
Footnote 15 This is the derivation given in Favreas Dictionary
Another from soa ha borne undergone might perhaps be
suggested with equal probability
Ap is a common termination of Malay words eg tangkap to seize
chakap to speak silap to mistake c The presence of the
Sanskrit root Ap to attain obtain is not indeed to be assumed in
every case but it is difficult to resist the conviction that it does
form a part of many Malay derivations Dapat to obtain rapat to
approach asap smoke cf vyApta awap steam tangkap to
seize grasp alapJav to take are instances which among others
might be cited
Gal Sansk to drop to distil percolate to fall is another root
which seems to enter into the composition of Malay words eg
tanggal to fall off to drop out tinggal to leave forsake
tunggal solitary panggal to chop off a portion chopped off
Compare also gali to dig tenggalam to sink tugal to sow rice
by putting seeds into holes made with a sharp stick galah a pole
galagala pitch
If it be correct to assign a Sanskrit origin to all or any of these
words they belong to a much earlier epoch than the comparatively pure
Sanskrit words the importation of which into Malay is the subject now
under discussion
The presence of Sanskrit words in the Malay language was first remarked
by Sir William Jones16 and the subject received more attention at the
hands of Marsden who gives a short list of fifteen words ataken with
little pains in the selection from a Malayan dictionarya17 Many of
the Sanskrit words are as Marsden observes asuch as the progress of
civilisation must soon have rendered necessary being frequently
expressive of the feelings of the mind or denoting those ordinary modes
of thought which result from the social habits of mankind or from the
evils that tend to interrupt thema This assertion might have been put
in more forcible terms had it occurred to the author to include not only
words expressive of thought and feelings but even some signifying
natural objects though doubtless most of these are expressed by
aboriginal words Hari day is clearly identical with the Sanskrit
hari athe suna which is also used as a name of Vishnu or Krishna
Matahari the sun Malay is thus athe eye of Haria and is a
compound formed of the native word mata and the Sanskrit hari
Halilintar a thunderbolt seems to be compounded similarly of hari
and lontar to hurl ahurled by Haria Here the r has been softened
into l The Sanskrit kapala has almost entirely superseded the use
