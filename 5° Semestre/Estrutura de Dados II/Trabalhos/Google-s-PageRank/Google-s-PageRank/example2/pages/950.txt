drawing of a complicated machine and pausing in his task of making
some intricate calculations You dont mean to say Tom that youre
going to have a try for a government prize for a submarine after all
No not a submarine prize dad and the youth laughed  Though our
Advance would take the prize away from almost any other underwater
boat I imagine No its another prize Im thinking about
What do you mean
Well I see by this paper that the Touring Club of America has offered
three thousand dollars for the speediest electric car  The tests are
to come off this fall on a new and specially built track on Long
Island and its to be an endurance contest for twentyfour hours or a
race for distance they havent yet decided But Im going to have a
try for it dad and besides winning the prize I think Ill take Andy
Foger down a peg
Whats Andy been doing now
Oh nothing more than usual Hes always mean and looking for a
chance to make trouble for me but I didnt refer to anything special
He has a new auto you know and he boasts that its the fastest one in
this country Ill show him that it isnt for Im going to win this
prize with the speediest car on the road
But Tom you havent any automobile you know and Mr Swift looked
anxiously at his son who was smiling confidently You cant be going
to make your motorcycle into an auto are you
No dad
Then how are you going to take part in the prize contest  Besides
electric cars as far as I know arent specially speedy
I know it and one reason why this club has arranged the contest is to
improve the quality of electric automobiles Im going to build an
electric runabout dad
An electric runabout  But it will have to be operated with a storage
battery Tom and you havent
I guess youre going to say I havent any storage battery dad
interrupted Mr Swifts son Well I havent yet but Im going to
have one Ive been working on
Oh ho exclaimed the aged inventor with a laugh So thats what
youve been tinkering over these last few weeks eh Tom  I suspected
it was some new invention but I didnt suppose it was that Well how
are you coming on with it
Pretty good I think Ive got a new idea for a battery and I made an
experimental one I gave it some pretty severe tests and it worked
fine
But you havent tried it out in a car yet over rough roads and under
severe conditions have you
No I havent had a chance In fact when I invented the battery I had
no idea of using it on a car I thought it might answer for commercial
purposes or for storing a current generated by windmills But when I
read that account in the papers of the Touring Club offering a prize
for the best electric car it occurred to me that I might put my
battery into an auto and win
Hum remarked Mr Swift musingly I dont take much stock in
electric autos Tom Gasolene seems to be the best or perhaps steam
generated by gasolene Im afraid youll be disappointed  All the
electric runabouts I ever saw while they were very nice cars didnt
seem able to go so very fast or very far
Thats true but its because they didnt have the right kind of a
battery You know an electric locomotive can make pretty good speed
Dad Over a hundred miles an hour in tests
Yes but they dont run by storage batteries They have a third rail
and powerful motors and Mr Swift looked quizzically at his son He
loved to argue with him for he said it made Tom think and often the
two would thus thresh out some knotty point of an invention to the
interests of both
Of course Dad there is a good deal of theory in what Im thinking
of the lad admitted But it does seem to me that if you put the
right kind of a battery into an automobile it could scoot along pretty
lively Look what speed a trolley car can make
Yes Tom but there again they get their power from an overhead wire
Some of them dont Theres a new storage battery been invented by a
New Jersey man which does as well as the third rail or the overhead
wire It was after reading about his battery that I thought of a plan
for mine It isnt anything like his perhaps not as good in some ways
but for what I want it is better in some respects I think For one
thing it can be recharged very quickly
Now Tom look here said Mr Swift earnestly laying aside his
papers and coming over to where his son sat You know I never
interfere with your inventions In fact the more you think of the
better I like it The airship you helped build certainly did all that
could be desired and
That reminds me Mr Sharp and Mr Damon are out in it now
interrupted Tom They ought to be back soon Yes Dad the airship Red
Cloud certainly scooted along
And the submarine too continued the aged inventor Your ideas
regarding that were of service to me and helped in our task of
recovering the treasure but Im afraid youre going to be disappointed
in the storage battery You may get it to work but I dont believe you
can make it powerful enough to attain any great speed Why dont you
confine yourself to making a battery for stationary work
Because Dad I believe I can build a speedy car and Im going to try
it Besides I want to race Andy Foger and beat him even if I dont
win the prize Im going to build that car and it will make fast time
Well go ahead Tom responded his father after a pause Of course
you can use the shops here as much as you want and Mr Sharp Mr
Jackson and I will help you all we can Only dont be disappointed
thats all
I wont Dad Suppose you come out to my shop and Ill show you a
sample battery Ive been testing for the last week I have it geared to
a small motor and its been running steadily for some time I want to
see what sort of a record its made
Father and son crossed the yard and entered a shop which the lad
considered exclusively his own There he had made many machines and
pieces of apparatus and had invented a number of articles which had
been patented and yielded him considerable of an income
Theres the battery Dad he said pointing to a complicated
mechanism in one corner
Whats that buzzing noise asked Mr Swift Thats the little motor
I run from the new cells Look here and Tom switched on an electric
light above the experimental battery from which he hoped so much It
consisted of a steel can about the size of the square gallon tin in
which maple syrup comes and from it ran two wires which were attached
to a small motor that was industriously whirring away
Tom looked at a registering gauge connected with it
Thats pretty good remarked the young inventor
What is it Tom and his father peered about the shop
Why this motor has run an equivalent of two hundred miles on one
charging of the battery Thats much better than I expected  I thought
if I got a hundred out of it Id be doing well Dad I believe after I
improve my battery a bit that Ill have the very thing I want  Ill
install a set of them in a car and it will go like the wind Ill
Toms enthusiastic remarks were suddenly interrupted by a low rumbling
sound
Thunder exclaimed Mr Swift The storm is coming and Mr Sharp and
Mr Damon in the airship
Hardly had he spoken than there sounded a crash on the roof of the
Swift house not far away At the same time there came cries of
distress and the crash was repeated
Come on Dad  Something has happened yelled Tom dashing from the
shop followed by his parent They found themselves in the midst of a
rain storm as they raced toward the house on the roof of which the
smashing noise was again heard
CHAPTER II
MR DAMONS STEERING
Tom Swift was a lad of action and his quickness in hurrying out to
investigate what had happened when he was explaining about his new
battery was characteristic of him Those of my readers who know him
through having read the previous books of this series need not be told
this but you who perhaps are just making his acquaintance may care
to know a little more about him
As told in my first book Tom Swift and His MotorCycle the young
inventor lived with his father Barton Swift a widower in the town of
Shopton New York Mr Swift was also an inventor of note
In my initial volume of this series Tom became possessed of a
motorcycle in a peculiar way It was sold to him by a Mr Wakefield
Damon a wealthy gentleman who was unfortunate in riding it On his
speedy machine which Tom improved by several inventions he had a
number of adventures The principal one was being attacked by a number
of bad men known as the Happy Harry Gang who wished to obtain
possession of a valuable turbine patent model belonging to Mr Swift
Tom was taking it to a lawyer when he was waylaid and chloroformed
Later he traced the gang and with the assistance of Mr Damon and
Eradicate Sampson an aged colored man who made a living for himself
and his mule Boomerang by doing odd jobs the lad found the thieves
and recovered a motorboat which had been stolen But the men got away
In the second volume called Tom Swift and His MotorBoat Tom bought
at auction the boat stolen by and recovered from the thieves and
proceeded to improve it While he was taking his father out on a cruise
for Mr Swifts health the Happy Harry Gang made a successful attempt
to steal some valuable inventions from the Swift house Tom started to
trace them and incidentally he raced and beat Andy Foger a rich
bully On their way down the lake after the robbery Tom his father
and Ned Newton Toms chum saw a man hanging from the trapeze of a
blazing balloon over Lake Carlopa The balloonist was Mr John Sharp
and he was rescued by Tom in a thrilling fashion In his motorboat
Tom had much pleasure not the least of which was taking out a young
lady named Miss Mary Nestor whose acquaintance he had made after
stopping her runaway horse which his bicycle had frightened  Toms
association with  Miss Nestor soon ripened into something deeper than
mere friendship
It developed that Mr Sharp whom Tom had saved from the burning
balloon was an aeronaut of note and had once planned to build an
airship After his recovery from his thrilling experience he mentioned
the matter to Mr Swift and his son with whom he took up his
residence This fitted right in with Toms ideas and soon father son
and the balloonist were constructing the Red Cloud as they named their
airship It was finally completed as related in Tom Swift and His
Airship made a successful trial trip and won a prize It was planned
to make a longer journey and Tom Mr Sharp and Mr Damon agreed to go
together Mr Damon was an odd individual who was continuously
blessing some part of his anatomy his clothing or some inanimate
object but for all that he was a fine man
The night before Tom and his friends started off in their airship the
Shopton Bank vault was blown open and seventyfive thousand dollars was
taken Tom and his friends did not know of this but no sooner had the
young inventor Mr Sharp and Mr Damon sailed away than the police
arrived at Mr Swifts house to arrest them They were charged with the
robbery and with having sailed away with the booty
It appeared that Andy Foger said he had seen Tom hanging around the
bank the night of the robbery with a bag of burglar tools in his
possession Search was immediately begun for the airship the occupants
of which were meanwhile speeding on
Tom and his two friends had trouble They were nearly burned up in a
forest fire and were fired upon by a crowd of people with rifles who
reading of the bank robbery and the reward offered for the capture of
the thieves hoped to bring down the airship  The fact that they were
fired upon caused Tom and the two aeronauts to descend to make an
investigation and for the first time they learned of the bank theft
How they got track of the real robbers took the sheriff with them in
the airship and raided the gang will be found set down at length in
the book  Also how Tom administered welldeserved thrashing to Andy
Foger
Mr Swift did not accompany his son in the airship and when asked why
he did not care to make the trip said he was working on a new type of
submarine boat which he hoped to enter in the government trials to
win a prize In the fourth volume of the series called Tom Swift and
his Submarine you may read how successful Mr Swift was
When the submarine called the Advance was finished the party made a
trip to recover three hundred thousand dollars in gold from a sunken
treasure ship off the coast of Uruguay South America They sailed
beneath the seas for many miles and were in great peril at times One
reason for this was that a rival firm of submarine builders got wind of
the treasure and tried to get ahead of the Swifts in recovering it
How Tom and his friends succeeded in their quest how they nearly
perished at the bottom of the sea how they were captured by a foreign
war vessel and sentenced to death how they fought with a school of
giant sharks and how they blew up the wreck to recover the money is all
told of in the book
On their return to civilization with the gold Mr Swift Tom and
their friends deposited the money in the Shopton Bank where Ned Newton
worked Ned was a bright lad but had not been advanced as rapidly as
he deserved and Tom knew this He asked his father to speak to the
president Mr Pendergast in Neds behalf and as a result the lad
was made assistant cashier for the request of a man who controlled a
three hundred thousand dollar deposit was not to be despised
In building the submarine Tom and his father rented a large cottage on
the New Jersey seacoast but on returning from their treasurequest
they went back to Shopton leaving the submarine at the boathouse of
the shore cottage which was near the city of Atlantis That was in the
fall of the year and all that winter the young inventor had been busy
on many things not the least of which was his storage battery It was
now spring and seeing the item in the paper about the touring club
prize for an electric auto had given him a new idea
But all thoughts of electric cars and everything else were driven
from the mind of the young man when with his father he rushed out to
see the cause of the crash on the roof of the Swift homestead
Theres something up there Tom called his father as he splashed on
through the rain
Thats right added his son And somebody too to judge by the fuss
theyre making
Maybe the house has been struck by lightning suggested the aged
inventor
No the storm isnt severe enough for that and besides if the house
had been struck youd hear Mrs Baggert yelling Dad  She
At that moment a womans voice cried out
Mr Swift Tom Where are you Something dreadful has happened
There she goes remarked Mr Swift as he splashed into a mud puddle
Bless my deflection rudder suddenly cried a voice from the flat roof
of the Swift house Hello I say is anyone down there
Yes we are answered Tom Is that you Mr Damon
Bless my collar button It certainly is
Wheres Mr Sharp I dont hear him
Oh Im here all right answered the balloonist Im trying to get
the airship clear of the chimney Mr Damon
Yes I steered wrong interrupted the odd man Bless my liver pin
but it was so dark I couldnt see and when that clap of thunder came I
shifted the deflection rudder instead of the lateral one and tried to
knock over your chimney
Are either of you hurt asked Mr Swift anxiously
No not at all replied Mr Sharp We were moving slowly ready for
a landing
Is the airship damaged inquired Tom
I dont know Not much I guess was the answer of the aeronaut
Ive stopped the engine and I dont like to start it again until I
can see what shape were in
Ill come up with Mr Jackson called Tom and he hastily summoned
Garret Jackson an engineer who had been in the service of Mr Swift
for many years Together they proceeded to the roof by a stairway that
led to a scuttle
Is anyone killed asked Mrs Baggert as Tom hurried up the stairs
Dont tell me there is Tom
Well I dont have to tell you for no one is replied the young
inventor with a laugh Its all right The airship tried to collide
with the chimney thats all
He was soon on the large flat roof of the dwelling and with the aid
of lanterns he the engineer and Mr Sharp made a hasty examination
Anything wrong inquired Mr Damon looking out from the cabin of the
Red Cloud where he had taken refuge after the crash and to get out of
the wet
Not much answered Tom One of the forward planes is smashed but we
can rise by means of the gas and float down Is all clear Mr Sharp
All clear replied the balloonist for the airship had now been
wheeled back from the entanglement with the chimney
Then here we go cried Tom as he and the aeronaut entered the craft
while Mr Jackson descended through the scuttle
There came a fiercer burst to the storm and amid a series of dazzling
lightning flashes and the muttering of thunder the airship rose from
the roof Tom switched on the searchlight and starting the big
propellers guided the craft skillfully toward the big shed where it
was housed when not in use
With the grace of a bird it turned about in the air and settled to the
ground It was the work of but a few minutes to run it into the shed
Then they all started for the house
Bless my umbrella  How it rains cried Mr Damon as he splashed on
through numerous puddles We got back just in time Mr Sharp
Where did you go asked the lad
Why we took a flight of about fifty miles and stopped at my house in
Waterfield for supper Were you anxious about us
A little when it began to storm replied Tom
Anything new since we left asked Mr Sharp for it was the custom of
himself or some of his friends to take little trips in the airship
They thought no more of it than many do of going for a short spin in an
automobile
Yes there is something new said Mr Swift as the party all
drenched now reached the broad veranda
Bless my gaiters cried Mr Damon What is it I hope the Happy
Harry gang hasnt robbed you again nor Berg and his men tried to take
that treasure away from us after we worked so hard to get it from the
wreck
No it isnt that replied Mr Swift The truth is that Tom thinks
he has invented a storage battery that will revolutionize matters Hes
going to build an electric automobile he says
I am declared the lad as the others looked at him and it will be
the speediest one you ever saw too
CHAPTER III
THE MOTORCYCLE WINS
Well Tom remarked Mr Sharp after a pause following the lads
announcement I didnt know you had any ambitions in that line Tell
us more about the battery What system do you use lead plates and
sulphuric acid
Oh thats out of date long ago declared the lad
Well I dont know much about electricity admitted the aeronaut
Ill take my chances in an airship or a balloon but when it comes to
electricity Im down and out
So am I admitted Mr Damon Bless my gizzard its all I can do to
put a new spark plug in my automobile Where is your new battery Tom
Out in my shop running yet if it hasnt been frightened by the
airship smash replied the lad somewhat proudly Its an oxide of
nickel battery with steel and oxide of iron negative electrodes
What solution do you use Tom asked Mr Swift I didnt get that
far in questioning you before the crash came he added
Well I have in the experimental battery a solution of potassium
hydrate replied the lad but I think Im going to change it and add
some lithium hydrate to it I think that will make it stronger
Bless my watch chain exclaimed Mr Damon Its all Greek to me
Suppose you let us see it Tom I like to see wheels go round but Im
not much of a hand for chemical terms
If youre sure youre not hurt by the airship smash I will declared
the lad
Oh were not hurt a bit insisted Mr Sharp As I said we were
moving slow for I knew it was about time to land Mr Damon was
steering
Yes I thought Id try my hand at it as it seemed so easy
interrupted the eccentric man But never againnot for mine I
couldnt see the house and before I knew it we were right over the
roof Then the chimney seemed to stick itself up suddenly in front of
us andwell you know the rest Im willing to pay for any damage I
caused
Oh not at all replied Tom Its easy enough to put on a new plane
or for that matter we can operate the Red Cloud without it But come
on Ill show you my sample battery
Here take umbrellas Mrs Baggert called after them as they started
toward the shop for it was still raining
We dont mind getting wet replied the young inventor Its in the
interests of science
Maybe it is You dont mind a wetting but I mind you coming in and
dripping water all over the carpets retorted the housekeeper
Bless my overshoes Im afraid we have wet the carpets a trifle now
admitted Mr Damon ruefully as he looked down at a puddle which had
formed where he had been standing
Thats the reason I want you to take umbrellas this trip insisted
Mrs Baggert
They complied and were soon in the shop where Tom explained his
battery The small motor was still running and had as the lad had
said gone the equivalent of over two hundred miles
If a small battery does as well as that what will a larger one do
asked Mr Damon
Much better I hope replied the youth But Dad doesnt seem to have
much faith in them
Well admitted Mr Swift I must say I am skeptical Still I
acknowledge Tom has done some pretty good work along electrical lines
He helped me with the positive and negative plates on the submarine
and maybewell well wait and see he concluded
If you build a car I hope you give me a ride in it said Mr Damon
Ive ridden fast in the air and swiftly on top of and under the
water Now Id like to ride rapidly on top of the earth The gasolene
auto doesnt go very fast
Ill give you a ride that will make your hair stand up prophesied
Tom and the time was to come when he would make good that prediction
The little party in the machine shop talked at some length about Toms
battery He showed them how it was constructed and gave them some of
his ideas regarding the new type of auto he planned to build
Well remarked Mr Swift at length if you want to keep your brain
fresh Tom you must get to bed earlier than this Its nearly twelve
oclock
And I want to get up early exclaimed the lad Im going to start to
build a larger battery tomorrow
And Im going to repair the airship added Mr Sharp
Bless my night cap I promised my wife Id be home early tonight
too suddenly exclaimed Mr Damon I dont fancy making the trip back
to Waterfield in my auto though Something will be sure to happen
Ill blow out a tire or a spark plug will get sooty on me and
Its raining harder than ever interrupted Tom Better stay here
tonight You can telephone home  Which Mr Damon did
Tom was up early the next morning in spite of the fact that he did not
go to bed in good season and before breakfast he was working at his
new storage battery After the meal he hurried back to the shop but it
was not long before he came out wheeling his motorcycle
Where are you going Tom asked Mrs Baggert
Oh Ive got to go to Mansburg to get some steel tubes for my new
battery he replied I thought I had some large enough but I
havent  Mansburg was a goodsized town near Shopton
Then I wish youd bring me a bottle of stove polish requested the
housekeeper The liquid kind Im out of it and the stove is as red
as a cow
All right agreed the lad as he leaped into the saddle and pedaled
off down the road A moment later he had turned on the power and was
speeding along the highway which was in good condition on account of
the shower of the night before
Tom was thinking so deeply of his new invention and planning what he
would do when he had his electric runabout built that almost before
he knew it he had reached Mansburg purchased the steel tubes and the
stove polish and was on his way back again
As he was speeding along on a level road he heard coming behind him
an automobile The lad turned to one side but in spite of this the
party in the car began a serenade of the electric siren and kept it
up making a wild discord
Whats the matter with those fellows inquired Tom of himself
Havent I given them enough of the road or has their steering gear
broken
He looked back over his shoulder and it needed but a glance to show
that the car was all right as regarded the steering apparatus And it
needed only another glance to disclose the reason for the shrill sound
of the siren
Andy Foger exclaimed Tom I might have known And Sam and Pete are
with him Well if he wants to make me get off the road hell find
that Ive got as much right as he has
He kept on a straight course wondering if the redhaired and
squinteyed bully would dare try to damage the motorcycle
A little later Andys car was beside Tom
Why dont you get out of the way demanded Sam who could usually be
depended on to aid Andy in all his mean tricks
Because Im entitled to half the road retorted our hero
Humph A slowmoving machine like yours hasnt any right on the road
sneered Andy who had slowed down his car somewhat
I havent eh demanded Tom Well if youll get down out of that
car for a few minutes Ill soon show you what my rights are
Now Andy more than once had come to personal encounters with Tom
much to the anguish of the bully He did not relish another
chastisement but his mean spirit could not brook interference
Dont you want a race he inquired of Tom in a sneering tone Ill
give you a mile start and beat you Ive got the fastest car built
You have eh asked Tom while a grim look came over his face Maybe
youll think differently some day
Aw hes afraid to race come on suggested Pete Dont bother with
him Andy
No I guess it wouldnt be worth my while was the reply of the
bully and he threw the second gear into place and began to move away
from the young inventor
Tom was just as much pleased to be left alone but he did not want Andy
Foger to think that he could have matters all his own way Toms
motorcycle since he had made some adjustments to it was very swift
In fact there were few autos that could beat it  He had never tried it
against Andys new car and he was anxious to do so
I wonder if I would stand any chance racing him thought the young
inventor as he saw the car slowly pulling away from him  I think
Ill wait until he gets some distance ahead and then Ill see how near
I can come to him If I get anywhere near him Im pretty sure I can
pass him Ill try it
When Andy and his cronies looked back Tom did not appear to be doing
anything save moving along at moderate speed on his machine
You dont dare race Pete Bailey shouted to him
Wait was what Tom whispered to himself
Andys car was now some distance ahead The young inventor waited a
little longer and then turned more power into his machine It leaped
forward and began to eat up the road as Tom expressed it He had
seen Andy throw in the third gear but knew that there was a fourth
speed on the bullys car
I dont know whether I can beat him on that or not thought the lad
dubiously If I try and fail theyll laugh at me But I dont think
Im going to fail
Faster and faster he rode He was rapidly overhauling Andys car now
and as they heard him approach the three cronies turned around
Hes going to race you after all Andy cried Sam
You mean hes going to try sneered Andy Ill give him all the
racing he wants
In another few seconds Tom was beside the auto and would have passed
it only Andy opened his throttle a little more For a moment the auto
jumped ahead and then as our hero turned on still more power he
easily held his own
Aw you can never beat us yelled Pete
Of course not added Sam
Ill leave him behind in a second prophesied Andy Wait until I
throw in the other gear he added to his cronies in a low voice He
thinks hes going to beat me Ill let him think so and then Ill
spurt ahead
The two machines were now racing along side by side Andys car was
going the limit on third gear but he still had the fourth gear in
reserve Tom too still had a little margin of speed
Suddenly Andy reached forward and yanked on a lever There was a
grinding of cogs as the fourth gear slipped into place for Andy did
not handle his car skillfully The effect however was at once
apparent The automobile shot forward
Now where are you Tom Swift cried Sam
Tom said nothing He merely shifted a lever and got a better spark He
also turned on a little more gasolene and opened the muffler The
quickness with which his motorcycle shot forward almost threw him from
the saddle but he had a tight grip on the handle bars He whizzed past
the auto but as the latter gathered speed it crept up to him and
once more was on even terms Much chagrined at seeing Tom hold pace
with him even for an instant Andy shouted
Get over on your own side there Youre crowding me
I am not yelled back Tom above the explosions of his machine
