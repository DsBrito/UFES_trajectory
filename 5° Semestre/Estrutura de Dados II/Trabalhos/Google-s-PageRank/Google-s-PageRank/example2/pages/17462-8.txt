THE GREAT ITALIAN AND FRENCH COMPOSERS
PALESTRINA
I
The Netherlands share other glories than that of having nursed the most
indomitable spirit of liberty known to mediteval Europe The fine
as well as the industrial arts found among this remarkable people
distinguished by Erasmus as possessed of the patientia laboris
an eager and passionate culture The early contributions of the Low
Countries to the growth of the pictorial art are well known to all But
to most it will be a revelation that the Belgian school of music was the
great fructifying influence of the fifteenth century to which Italy and
Germany owe a debt not easily measured The art of interweaving parts
and that science of sound known as counterpoint were placed by this
school of musical scholars and workers on a solid basis which enabled
the great composers who came after them to build their beautiful tone
fabrics in forms of imperishable beauty and symmetry For a long time
most of the great Italian churches had Belgian chapelmasters and
the value of their example and teachings was vital in its relation to
Italian music
The last great master among the Belgians and after Palestrina
the greatest of the sixteenth century was Orlando di Lasso born in
Hainault in the year 1520 His life of a little more than three score
years and ten was divided between Italy and Germany He left the deep
imprint of his severe style though but a young man on his Italian
confreres and the young Palestrina owed to him much of the largeness
and beauty of form through which he poured his genius in the creation of
such works as have given him so distinct a place in musical history The
pope created Orlando di Lasso Knight of the Golden Spur and sought to
keep him in Italy Unconcerned as to fame the gentle peaceful musician
lived for his art alone and the flattering expressions of the great
were not so much enjoyed as endured by him A musical historian
Heimsoeth says of him He is the brilliant master of the North
great and sublime in sacred composition of inexhaustible invention
displaying much breadth variety and depth in his treatment he
delights in full and powerful harmonies yet after allowing to an
existence passed in journeys as well as service at court and occupied
at the same time with both sacred and secular musiche came short of
that lofty solemn tone which pervades the works of the great master of
the South Palestrina who with advancing years restricted himself more
and more to church music Of the celebrated penitential psalms of Di
Lasso it is said that Charles IX of France ordered them to be written
in order to obtain rest for his soul after the horrible massacre of St
Bartholomew Aside from his works this musician has a claim on
fame through his lasting improvements in musical form and method He
illuminated and at the same time closed the great epoch of Belgian
ascendancy which had given three hundred musicians of great science
to the times in which they lived So much has been said of Orlando di
Lasso for he was the model and Mentor of the greatest of early church
composers Palestrina

The melodious and fascinating style soon to give birth to the
characteristic genius of the opera was as yet unborn though dormant
In Rome the chief seat of the Belgian art the exclusive study of
technical skill had frozen music to a mere formula The Gregorian
chant had become so overladen with mere embellishments as to make the
prescribed churchform difficult of recognition in its borrowed garb
for it had become a mere jumble of sound Musicians indeed carried
their profanation so far as to take secular melodies as the themes for
masses and motetts These were often called by their profane titles So
the name of a lovesonnet or a drinkingsong would sometimes be attached
to a miserere The council of Trent in 1562 cut at these evils with
sweeping axe and the solemn anathemas of the church fathers roused the
creative poweis of the subject of this sketch who raised his art to
an independent national existence and made it rank with sculpture and
painting which had already reached their zenith in Leonardo Da Vinci
Raphael Correggio Titian and Michel Angelo Henceforth Italian music
was to be a vigorous fruitful stock
Giovanni Perluigui Aloisio da Palestrina was born at Palestrina the
ancient Prneste in 1524
Our composer as was common with artists and scholars in
those days took the name of his natal town and by this he
is known to fame Old documents also give him the old Latin
name of the town with the personal ending
The memorials of his childhood are scanty We know but little except
that his parents were poor peasants and that he learned the rudiments
of literature and music as a choirsinger a startingpoint so common in
the lives of great composers In 1540 he went to Rome and studied in
the school of Goudimel a stern Huguenot Fleming tolerated in the papal
capital on account of his superior science and method of teaching and
afterward murdered at Lyons on the day of the Paris massacre Palestrina
grasped the essential doctrines of the school without adopting its
mannerisms At the age of thirty he published his first compositions
and dedicated them to the reigning pontiff Julius III In the formation
of his style which moved with such easy original grace within the old
prescribed rules he learned much from the personal influence and advice
of Orlando di Lasso his warm friend and constant companion during these
earlier days
Several of his compositions written at this time are still performed
in Rome on Good Friday and Goethe and Mendelssohn have left their
eloquent tributes to the impression made on them by music alike simple
and sublime The pope was highly pleased with Palestrinas noble music
and appointed him one of the papal choristers then regarded as a great
honor But beyond Rome the new light of music was but little known
The Council of Trent in their first indignation at the abuse of church
music had resolved to abolish everything but the simple Gregorian
chants but the remonstrances of the Emperor Ferdinand and the Roman
cardinals stayed the austere fiat The final decision was made to rest
on a new composition of Palestrina who was permitted to demonstrate
that the higher forms of musical art were consistent with the
solemnities of church worship
All eyes were directed to the young musician for the very existence
of his art was at stake The motto of his first mass Illumina oculos
meos shows the pious enthusiasm with which he undertook his labors
Instead of one he composed three sixpart masses The third of these
excited such admiration that the pope exclaimed in raptures It is John
who gives us here in this earthly Jerusalem a foretaste of that new song
which the holy Apostle John realized in the heavenly Jerusalem in his
prophetic trance This is now known as the mass of Pope Marcel in
honor of a former patron of Palestrina
A new pope Paul IV on ascending the pontifical throne carried his
desire of reforming abuses to fanaticism He insisted on all the papal
choristers being clerical Palestrina had married early in life a Roman
lady of whom all we know is that her name was Lucretia Four children
had blessed the union and the composers domestic happiness became a
bar to his temporal preferment With two others he was dismissed from
the chapel because he was a layman and a trifling pension allowed him
Two months afterward though he was appointed chapelmaster of St
John Lateran His works now succeeded each other rapidly and different
collections of his masses were dedicated to the crowned heads of Europe
In 1571 he was appointed chapelmaster of the Vatican and Pope Gregory
XIII gave special charge of the reform of sacred music to Palestrina
The death of the composers wife whom he idolized in 1580 was a blow
from which he never recovered In his latter days he was afflicted with
great poverty for the positions he held were always more honorable than
lucrative Mental depression and physical weakness burdened the last few
years of his pious and gentle life and he died after a lingering and
severe illness The register of the pontifical chapel contains this
entry February 2 1594 This morning died the most excellent musician
Signor Giovanni Palestrina our dear companion and maestro di capella
of St Peters church whither his funeral was attended not only by all
the musicians of Rome but by an infinite concourse of people when his
own Libera me Domine was sung by the whole college
Such are the simple and meagre records of the life of the composer who
carved and laid the foundation of the superstructure of Italian music
who viewed in connection with his times and their limitations must be
regarded as one of the great creative minds in his art who shares with
Sebastian Bach the glory of having built an imperishable base for the
labors of his successors
III
Palestrixa left a great mass of compositions all glowing with the fire
of genius only part of which have been published His simple life was
devoted to musical labor and passed without romance diversion or
excitement His works are marked by utter absence of contrast and
color Without dramatic movement they are full of melody and majesty a
majesty serene unruffled by the slightest suggestion of human passion
Voices are now and then used for individual expression but either in
unison or harmony As in all great church music the chorus is the key
of the work The general judgment of musicians agrees that repose and
enjoyment are more characteristic of this music than that of any
other master The choir of the Sistine chapel by the inheritance of
longcherished tradition is the most perfect exponent of the
Palestrina music During the annual performance of the Improperie and
Lamentations the altar and walls are despoiled of their pictures and
ornaments and everything is draped in black The cardinals dressed in
serge no incense no candles the whole scene is a striking picture of
trouble and desolation The faithful come in two by two and bow before
the cross while the sad music reverberates through the chapel arches
This powerful appeal to the imagination of course lends greater power
to the musical effect But all minds who have felt the lift and beauty
of these compositions have acknowledged how far they soar above words
and creeds and the picturesque framework of a liturgy
Mendelssohn in a letter to Zelter on the Palestrina music as heard in
the Sistine chapel says that nothing could exceed the effect of the
blending of the voices the prolonged tones gradually merging from one
note and chord to another softly swelling decreasing at last dying
out They understand he writes how to bring out and place each
trait in the most delicate light without giving it undue prominence
one chord gently melts into another The ceremony at the same time is
solemn and imposing deep silence prevails in the chapel only broken
by the reechoing Greek holy sung with unvarying sweetness and
expression The composer Paer was so impressed with the wonderful
beauty of the music and the performance that he exclaimed This is
indeed divine music such as I have long sought for and my imagination
was never able to realize but which I knew must exist
Palestrinas versatility and genius enabled him to lift ecclesiastical
music out of the rigidity and frivolity characterizing on either
hand the opposing ranks of those that preceded him and to embody
the religious spirit in works of the highest art He transposed the
ecclesiastical melody canto fermo from the tenor to the soprano
thus rendering it more intelligible to the ear and created that
glorious thing choir song with its refined harmony that noble music
of which his works are the models and the papal chair the oracle No
individual preeminence is ever allowed to disturb and weaken the ideal
atmosphere of the whole work However Palestrinas successors have aimed
to imitate his effects they have with the exception of Cherubini
failed for the most part for every peculiar genus of art is the result
of innate genuine inspiration and the spontaneous growth of the age
which produces it As a parent of musical form he was the protagonist
of Italian music both sacred and secular and left an admirable model
which even the new school of opera so soon to rise found it necessary to
follow in the construction of harmony The splendid and often licentious
music of the theatre built its most worthy effects on the work of the
pious composer who lived labored and died in an atmosphere of almost
anchorite sanctity
The great disciples of his school Nannini and Allegri continued his
work and the splendid Miserere of the latter was regarded as such
an inestimable treasure that no copy of it was allowed to go out of the
Sistine chapel till the infant prodigy Wolfgang Mozart wrote it out
from the memory of a single hearing
PICCINI PAISIELLO AND CIMAROSA

Music as speaking the language of feeling emotion and passion found
its first full expansion in the operatic form There had been attempts
to represent drama with chorus founded on the ancient Greek drama but
it was soon discovered that dialogue and monologue could not be embodied
in choral forms without involving an utter absurdity The spirit of
the renaissance had freed poetry statuary and painting from the
monopolizing elaims of the church Music which had become a well
equipped and developed science could not long rest in a similar
servitude Though it is not the aim of the author to discuss operatic
history a brief survey of the progress of opera from its birth cannot
be omitted
The oldest of the entertainments which ripened into Italian opera
belongs to the last years of the fifteenth century and was the work
of the brilliant Politian known as one of the revivalists of Greek
learning attached to the court of Cosmo de Medici and his son Lorenzo
This was the musical drama of Orfeo The story was written in Latin
and sung in music principally choral though a few solo phrases were
given to the principal characters It was performed at Rome with great
magnificence and Vasari tells us that Peruzzi the decorator of the
papal theatre painted such scenery for it that even the great Titian
was so struck with the vraisemblance of the work that he was not
satisfied until he had touched the canvas to be sure of its not being in
relief We may fancy indeed that the scenery was one great attraction
of the representation In spite of spasmodic encouragement by the more
liberally minded pontiffs the general weight of church influence was
against the new musical tendency and the most skilled composers were at
first afraid to devote their talents to further its growth
What musicians did not dare undertake out of dread of the thunderbolts
of the church a company of literati at Florence commenced in 1580
The primary purpose was the revival of Greek art including music This
association in conjunction with the Medicean Academy laid down the
rule that distinct individuality of expression in music was to be sought
for As results quickly came musical drama with recitative modern form
of the Greek chorus and solo melody for characteristic parts of the
legend or story Out of this beginning swiftly grew the opera Composers
in the new form sprung up in various parts of Italy though Naples
Venice and Florence continued to be its centres
Between 1637 and 1700 there were performed three hundred operas at
Venice alone An account of the performance of Berenice composed by
Domenico Freschi at Padua in 1680 dwarfs all our present ideas of
spectacular splendor In this opera there were choruses of a hundred
virgins and a hundred soldiers a hundred horsemen in steel armor a
hundred performers on trumpets cornets sackbuts drums flutes and
other instruments on horseback and on foot two lions led by two Turks
and two elephants led by two Indians Berenices triumphal car drawn
by four horses and six other cars with spoils and prisoners drawn by
twelve horses Among the scenes in the first act was a vast plain
with two triumphal arches another with pavilions and tents a square
prepared for the entrance of the triumphal procession and a forest
for the chase In the second act there were the royal apartments of
Berenices temple of vengeance a spacious court with view of the prison
and a covered way with long lines of chariots In the third act there
were the royal dressingroom the stables with a hundred live horses
porticoes adorned with tapestry and a great palace in the perspective
In the course of the piece there were representations of the hunting of
the boar the stag and the lions The whole concluded with a huge globe
descending from the skies and dividing itself in lesser globes of fire
on which stood allegorical figures of fame honor nobility virtue and
glory The theatriccal manager had princes and nobles for bankers and
assistants and they lavished their treasures of art and money to
make such spectacles as the modern stagemen of London and Paris cannot
approach
In Evelyns diary there is an entry describing opera at Venice in 1645
This night having with my lord Bruce taken our places before we
went to the opera where comedies and other plays are represented
in recitative musiq by the most excellent musicians vocal and
instrumental with variety of scenes painted and contrived with no
lesse art of perspective and machines for flying in the aire and other
wonderful motions taken together it is one of the most magnificent and
expensive diversions the wit of man can invent The history was Hercules
in Lydia The sceanes changed thirteen times The famous voices Anna
Rencia a Roman and reputed the best treble of women but there was
a Eunuch who in my opinion surpassed her also a Genoise that in my
judgment sung an incomparable base They held us by the eyes and ears
till two oclock i the morning Again he writes of the carnival
of 1640 The comedians have liberty and the operas are open witty
pasquils are thrown about and the mountebanks have their stages at
every corner The diversion which chiefly took me up was three noble
operas where were most excellent voices and music the most celebrated
of which was the famous and beautiful Anna Rencia whom we invited to
a fish dinner after four daies in Lent when they had given over at the
theatre Old Evelyn then narrates how he and his noble friend took the
lovely diner out on a junketing and got shot at with blunderbusses from
the gondola of an infuriated rival
Opera progressed toward a fixed status with a swiftness hardly
paralleled in the history of any art The soil was rich and fully
prepared for the growth and the fecund root once planted shot into
a luxuriant beauty and symmetry which nothing could check The Church
wisely gave up its opposition and henceforth there was nothing to
impede the progress of a product which spread and naturalized itself
in England France and Germany The inventive genius of Monteverde
Carissimi Scarlatti the friend and rival of Handel Durante and
Leonardo Leo perfected the forms of the opera nearly as we have them
today A line of brilliant composers in the school of Durante and Leo
brings us down through Pergolesi Derni Terradiglias Jomelli Traetta
Ciccio di Majo Galuppi and Giuglielmi to the most distinguished of
the early Italian composers Nicolo Piccini who mostly forgotten
in his works is principally known to modern fame as the rival of the
mighty Gluck in that art controversy which shook Paris into such bitter
factions Yet overshadowed as Piccini was in the greatness of his
rival there can be no question of his desert as the most brilliant
ornament and exponent of the early operatic school No greater honor
could have been paid to him than that he should have been chosen as
their champion by the Italianissimi of his day in the battle royal
with such a giant as Gluck an honor richly deserved by a composer
distinguished by multiplicity and beauty of ideas dramatic insight and
ardent conviction
II
Niccolo Piccini who was not less than fifty years of age when he left
Naples for the purpose of outrivaling Gluck was born at Bari in the
kingdom of Naples in 1728 His father also a musician had destined
him for holy orders but Nature made him an artist His great delight
even as a little child was playing on the harpsichord which he quickly
learned One day the bishop of Bari heard him playing and was amazed
at the power of the little virtuoso By all means send him to a
conservatory of music he said to the elder Piccini If the vocation
of the priesthood brings trials and sacrifices a musical career is
not less beset with obstacles Music demands great perseverance and
incessant labor It exposes one to many chagrins and toils
By the advice of the shrewd prelate the precocious boy was placed at
the school of St Onofrio at the age of fourteen At first confided to
the care of an inferior professor he revolted from the arid teachings
of a mere human machine Obeying the dictates of his daring fancy
though hardly acquainted with the rudiments of composition he
determined to compose a mass The news got abroad that the little
Niccolo was working on a grand mass and the great Leo the chief of the
conservatory sent for the trembling culprit
You have written a mass he commenced
Excuse me sir I could not help it said the timid boy
Let me see it
Niccolo brought him the score and all the orchestral parts and Leo
immediately went to the concertroom assembled the orchestra and
gave them the parts The boy was ordered to take his place in front and
conduct the performance which he went through with great agitation
I pardon you this time said the grave maestro at the end but if
you do such a thing again I will punish you in such a manner that you
will remember it as long as you live Instead of studying the
principles of your art you give yourself up to all the wildness of your
imagination and when you have tutored your illregulated ideas into
something like shape you produce what you call a mass and no doubt
think you have produced a masterpiece
When the boy burst into tears at this rebuke Leo clasped him in his
arms told him he had great talent and after that took him under
his special instruction Leo was succeeded by Durante who also loved
Piccini and looked forward to a future greatness for him He was wont
to say the others were his pupils but Piccini was his son After
twelve years spent in the conservatory Piccini commenced an opera The
director of the principal Neapolitan theatre said to Prince Vintimille
who introduced the young musician that his work was sure to be a
failure
How much can you lose by his opera the prince replied supposing it
be a perfect fiasco The manager named the sum
There is the money then replied Piccinis generous patron handing
him a purse If the Dorme Despetose the name of the opera should
fail you may keep the money but otherwise return it to me
The friends of Lagroscino the favorite composer of the day were
enraged when they heard that the next new work was to be from an obscure
youth and they determined to hiss the performance So great however
was the delight of the public with the freshness and beauty of Piccinis
music that even those who came to condemn remained to applaud The
reputation of the composer went on increasing until he became the
foremost name of musical Italy for his fertility of production was
remarkable and he gave the theatres a brilliant succession of comic and
serious works In 1758 he produced at Rome his Alessandro nell Indie
whose success surpassed all that had preceded it and two years later
a still finer masterpiece La Buona Figluola written to a text
furnished by the poet Goldoni and founded on the story of Richardsons
Pamela This opera was produced at every playhouse on the Italian
peninsula in the course of a few years A pleasant mot by the Duke of
Brunswick is worth preserving in this connection Piccini had married a
beautiful singer named Vicenza Sibilla and his home was very happy One
day the German prince visited Piccini and found him rocking the cradle
of his youngest child while the eldest was tugging at the paternal
coattails The mother being en deshabille ran away at the sight
of a stranger The duke excused himself for his want of ceremony and
added I am delighted to see so great a man living in such simplicity
and that the author of La Bonne Fille is such a good father
Piccinis placid and pleasant life was destined however to pass into
stormy waters
His sway over the stage and the popular preference continued until
1773 when a clique of envious rivals at Rome brought about his first
disaster The composer was greatly disheartened and took to his bed
for he was ill alike in mind and body The turningpoint in his career
had come and he was to enter into an arena which taxed his powers in a
contest such as he had not yet dreamed of His operas having been
heard and admired in France their great reputation inspired the
royal favorite Mme du Barry with the hope of finding a successful
competitor to the great German composer patronized by Marie Antoinette
Accordingly Piccini was offered an indemnity of six thousand francs
and a residence in the hotel of the Neapolitan ambassador When the
Italian arrived in Paris Gluck was in full sway the idol of the court
and public and about to produce his Armide
Piccini was immediately commissioned to write a new opera and he
applied to the brilliant Marmontel for a libretto The poet rearranged
one of Quinaults tragedies Roland and Piccini undertook the
difficult task of composing music to words in a language as yet unknown
to him Marcnontel was his unwearied tutor and he writes in his
Memoirs of his pleasant yet arduous task Line by line word by word
I had everything to explain and when he had laid hold of the meaning
of a passage I recited it to him marking the accent the prosody
and the cadence of the verses He listened eagerly and I had the
satisfaction to know that what he heard was carefully noted His
delicate ear seized so readily the accent of the language and the
measure of the poetry that in his music he never mistook them It was
an inexpressible pleasure to me to see him practice before my eyes an
art of which before I had no idea His harmony was in his mind He wrote
his airs with the utmost rapidity and when he had traced its designs
he filled up all the parts of the score distributing the traits of
harmony and melody just as a skillful painter would distribute on his
canvas the colors lights and shadows of his picture When all this
was done he opened his harpsichord which he had been using as his
writingtable and then I heard an air a duet a chorus complete in
all its parts with a truth of expression an intelligence a unity
of design a magic in the harmony which delighted both my ear and my
feelings
Piccinis arrival in Paris had been kept a close secret while he was
working on the new opera but Abbe du Rollet ferreted it out and
acquainted Gluck which piece of news the great German took with
philosophical disdain Indeed he attended the rehearsal of Roland
and when his rival in despair over his ignorance of French and the
stupidity of the orchestra threw down the baton in despair Gluck took
it up and by his magnetic authority brought order out of chaos
and restored tranquillity a help as much probably the fruit of
condescension and contempt as of generosity
Still Gluck was not easy in mind over this intrigue of his enemies and
wrote a bitter letter which was made public and aggravated the war
of public feeling Epigrams and accusations flew back and forth like
hailstones
See article on Gluck in Great German Composers
Do you know that the Chevalier Glucks title has an Armida and
Orlando in his portfolio said Abbe Arnaud to a Piccinist
But Piccini is also at work on an Orlando was the retort
So much the better returned the abbe for then we shall have an
Orlando and also an Orlandino was the keen answer
The public attention was stimulated by the war of pamphlets lampoons
and newspaper articles Many of the great literati were Piccinists
among them Marmontel La Harpe DAlembert etc Suard du Rollet and
Jean Jacques Rousseau fought in the opposite ranks Although the nation
was trembling on the verge of revolution and the French had just lost
their hold on the East Indies though Mirabeau was thundering in the
tribune and Jacobin clubs were commencing their baleful work soon to
drench Paris in blood all factions and discords were forgotten
The question was no longer Is he a Jansenist a Molinist an
Encyclopdist a philosopher a freethinker One question only was
thought of Is he a Gluckist or Piccinist and on the answer often
depended the peace of families and the cement of longestablished
friendships
Piccinis opera was a brilliant success with the fickle Parisians
though the Gluckists sneered at it as pretty concert music The retort
was that Gluck had no gift of melody though they admitted he had the
advantage over his rival of making more noise The poor Italian was so
much distressed by the fierce contest that he and his family were in
despair on the night of the first representation He could only say
to his weeping wife and son Come my children this is unreasonable
Remember that we are not among savages we are living with the politest
and kindest nation in Europe If they do not like me as a musician they
will at all events respect me as a man and a stranger To do justico
to Piccini a mild and timid man he never took part in the controversy
and always spoke of his opponent with profound respect and admiration
III
Marie Antoinette whom Mme du Barry and her clique looked on as
Piccinis enemy astonished both cabals by appointing Piccini her
singingmaster an unprofitable honor for he received no pay and was
obliged to give costly copies of his compositions to the royal family
He might have quoted from the Latin poet in regard to this favor from
Marie Antoinette whose faction in music among other names was known
as the Greek party Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes
I fear the Greeks though offering gifts
Beaumarchais the brilliant author of Figaro had found the same
inconvenience when acting as court teacher to the daughters of Louis XV
The French kings were parsimonious except when lavishing money on their
vices
The action of the dauphiness however paved the way for a
reconciliation between Piccini and Gluck Berton the manager of the
opera gave a luxurious banquet and the musicians side by side
pledged each other in libations of champagne Gluck got confidential
in his cups These French he said are good enough people but they
make me laugh They want us to write songs for them and they cant
sing In fact the quarrel was not between the musicians but their
adherents In his own heart Piccini knew his inferiority to Gluck
De Vismes Bertons successor proposed that both should write operas on
the same subject Iphigenia in Tauris and gave him a libretto The
French public will have for the first time he said the pleasure of
hearing two operas on the same theme with the same incidents the
same characters but composed by two great masters of totally different
schools
But objected the alarmed Italian if Glucks opera is played first
the public will be so delighted that they will not listen to mine
To avoid that catastrophe said the director we will play yours
first
But Gluck will not permit it
I give you my word of honor said De Vismes that your opera shall be
put in rehearsal and brought out as soon as it is finished
Before Piccini had finished his opera he heard that his rival was
back from Germany with his Iphigenia completed and that it was in
rehearsal The director excused himself on the plea of its being a royal
command Glucks work was his masterpiece and produced an unparalleled
sensation among the Parisians Even his enemies were silenced and La
Harpe said it was the chef doeuvre of the world Piccinis work
