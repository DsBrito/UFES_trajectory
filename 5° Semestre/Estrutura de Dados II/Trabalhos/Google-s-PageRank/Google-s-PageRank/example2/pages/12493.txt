CHAPTER I
The Prairie Pasture
Out on the prairie in one of the western states where buffaloes and
wild horses once had roamed at their pleasure and where cacti and
yuccas still thrived and bloomed could be seen a small twostory frame
building There was nothing strange in this except that the house was
different from the average house of the plains for at this particular
time the greater part of the dwellings were made of sod mud and brush
The people generally speaking were of that type who think principally
of getting all the enjoyment from their everyday lives that it is
possible to obtain There was therefore little thought among them of
the hereafter when men must give an account of themselves before a just
and living God In fact the younger generation scarcely knew that there
was a God who took note of all their ways
The building so different from the ordinary dwellings upon the prairie
was the home of a tiny lad named John It was a happy home for both
his parents were living and the love that bound their hearts together
brought peace and happiness to each member of the little household But
could this happy group have known of the presence of a grim monster just
outside the door who at that very moment was seeking an entrance their
joy would have given place to sorrow Death was soon to destroy the
light and comfort of that home The devoted wife and mother was not
strong and after a severe illness lasting but a few short days her
spirit left the ones she loved and her lifeless body was carried to
its last resting place in the cemetery a few miles away
Little John was of course too young to realize the true meaning of the
change but that something dreadful had happened he very well knew and
his large pathetic eyes spoke the grief that he did understand and could
not express During the three years of his short life he had known the
care of a tender loving mother whose ambitions were high and noble
Although not a Christian she had often expressed her wish that her
little browneyed boy might grow up to be an honor to his father and
mother and a blessing to his country After her death his papas eyes
were often filled with tears for he loved and pitied his little boy
One evening when the lights were dim and the hands of the clock were
pointing to the bedtime hour John felt his fathers arms tenderly
encircled about him and heard him softly saying My little John we are
left all alone now and you must hurry up and become a man as soon as
you can for I need you to help me Mama has gone away and left us and
she cannot teach you the things that she had planned that you should
know so we will have to do the best that we can but you must help me
First of all I want you to learn how to pray for there is a God in
heaven who made you and of whom your mother expected to tell you
Before Him we should bow down and pray every night before we go to
sleep
Does He hear all the words we say asked little John in an awed tone
quite unable to comprehend his fathers meaning and does He look at us
when we are asleep
Yes his father answered God sees and knows everything Now I will
tell you the short prayer that I used to say when I was a little boy
like youthe prayer that my mother taught me
Thus it was that John kneeling beside his little bed repeated the
prayer that has been lisped by thousands of other baby voices
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray thee Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray thee Lord my soul to take
As the days and weeks sped by John thought often of his dear mama and
wished that he might see her but he as often would recall his fathers
words to be a little man and with all his strength he endeavored to be
what he considered a man ought to be But although he tried in his
childish way to be one he was often very lonely and had it not been
for frequent visits to his uncles home several miles distant he would
have missed his precious mother even more than he did While at his
uncles he could play with his two cousins Will and Charley At last
it was decided that it would be best for John and his father to go and
make their home with the uncle until John was older
Now Charley was just about Johns age but as Charley was a cripple
John had chosen Will who was several years the oldest to be his
closest friend and companion Regardless of these facts however the
three boys generally played together Their playground was the vast
dooryard extending far out over the prairie
In time they were given the responsibility of herding the cows To herd
the cows meant to see that the cattle did not wander about in the
neighborhood corn wheat and barley fields that were scattered about
here and there over the prairies and that were in but few instances
fenced and to see that they were driven to some waterplace at certain
intervals and were brought home at the milking hour
The watering places were known as buffalowallows for they had been
made by the buffalos in wallowing These basins were usually kept filled
with water by the rains Some of the wallows or ponds were rather
deep and were treacherous because of sudden dropoffs but they were
usually shallow and it was generally safe for the children to play
along the edge
After the first sharp edge of his grief was dulled Johns father did
not feel it so keenly his duty to instruct his child and to teach him
to reverence his Creator and when John was about six years of age the
father was kept so busy with his work that he had but little time to
spend with the child Johns aunt too although a good woman was too
much occupied with housekeeping to do her duty by her own two boys much
less by a third So John and his cousins had spent nearly all of the
three years that they had been together in doing as they pleased and in
finding as much enjoyment in living as it was possible for them to find
It was therefore not strange that they had learned and invented many
new ways to get amusement and that some of these were evil for Satan
as he always does in such cases had lent them a helping hand
The work of attending to the cows did not of course occupy nearly all
their time and the boys found it great sport to play around the wallows
and in them
On one occasion Will said
Say boys did you ever hear the story about the man who walked upon
the water I dont remember just how the story went but I heard
somebody say that the mans name was Jesus and that another man got out
of a boat to go and meet Him The first fellow did all right but the
second one came very near drowning because he looked down at the water
Maybe he wanted to see how deep the water was and I guess he would have
got drowned if they hadnt been close to the shore Now I am going to
do like Jesus did Want to see me
Naturally both the boys wanted to see him perform a feat like that and
Will quickly scampered into the water Now the wallow was very shallow
all the way across and Will was soon on the opposite side The smaller
boys not knowing the depth of the water supposed that it was deep and
that Will had actually done some marvelous thing Will did not know that
he was doing wrong by speaking lightly of one of the Saviors miracles
for he had never been in Sundayschool and his parents had not taught
him the sacredness of the words and acts of the Savior He simply wanted
to play a joke on his companions
The smaller boys talked the matter over when they were alone and John
said
Say Charley what do you suppose held Will up the other day on that
water That wallow must have been deep out in the middle Lets try it
some time for ourselves when Will isnt around I believe we could do it
as well as he did
Charley was agreed and the two smaller lads watched their chance One
day when Will was not with them they chose a wallow that they thought
would answer their purpose Ill go first Charley said and he
hurried forward as rapidly as his little crippled limb could carry him
to the waters edge and out into the pond
Suddenly poor little Charley disappeared John saw his cousin as he
went down into the deep water and realized his danger He knew that
something must be done and done at once and with a bound he sprang in
after his companion He did not however go beyond the shallow water
and when his cousin came to the surface he reached out his hand and
caught him by the hair and as Charley had not lost the power to help
himself he was soon able by Johns assistance to scramble to a place
of safety
The boys decided that they would say nothing about the accident and as
they remained away from the house long enough for Charleys clothing to
dry no questions were asked But was the scene unnoticed No He who
notes the sparrows fall was watching over these little boys He had not
forgotten Johns little prayer that had been taught him by his father
God was caring for these little untaught children in that vast prairie
pasture
CHAPTER II
In the Sod Cellar
Almost without exception the homes on the prairies were provided with
sod cellars Even the few modern dwellings in the community in which
Johns uncle lived were not without these oldfashioned cellars which
served as a protection in times of storms and tornadoes The cellars
served also as places in which to store the fruits and vegetables for
winter use And very often too a large quantity of tobacco leaves that
had been dried and kept back when the summers crop was sold could be
discovered in one of these places
The home of Johns uncle was provided with just such a cellara deep
hole dug in the ground and covered over with a dense roofing of brush
mud and sod Within this cellar a large supply of tobacco leaves had
been stored John had been in the cellar many times He knew the tobacco
was there and he knew to what use his uncle put the tobacco He knew
also that his cousin Will both chewed and smoked the leaves but it had
not occurred to him that he himself could do so
The reason why he had not thought of using it was perhaps that his
father had once told him that the using of tobacco was a bad habit and
urged him to let it alone But the fact that he had not been tempted did
not guarantee that he would not be the fact that he had no appetite for
tobacco did not conclusively prove that he would never acquire one nor
did the fact that he had been told to let tobacco alone warrant that he
would need no further watchingfor an unforeseen temptation was lurking
near
One day when John went into the cellar with his cousin Will his cousin
filled a pipe with the leaves and offered it to him bidding him smoke
John shook his head and said that he did not want to smoke for his
father had said that using tobacco was a bad habit and that it would
ruin his health
Then why does he use it himself Will reasoned Do you suppose that
he would use it if he thought that it was going to hurt him Now John
look here you said that you wanted to become a man Heres your chance
If you get to where you can smoke a pipe chew tobacco and spit in the
way that your father and my dad do you will be a man Just some folks
saying that it is a bad habit doesnt need to make any difference with
you
As John thought over his cousins words they did seem reasonable and
he remembered that all the men he had ever seen used tobacco So he
decided that if he expected to be a man himself he must soon begin to
use it too He therefore accepted the pipe and began to puff vigorously
at the stem But try as he would he couldnt make the pretty little
curls of smoke mount up into the air as he had watched his father and
other men do Very soon however a deathly sickness began to steal over
him His head and stomach hurt and he could scarcely help falling down
on the floor of the cellar
O Will he said as he gave the pipe to his cousin I am so sick
Lets get out of here I feel as though I was going to die And John
started in an attempt to find the opening through which he had entered
the cellar but to his surprise and terror he could not find it
O Will he said this is all your fault You know I didnt want to
smoke I wish now that I hadnt listened to you Father said tobacco
would make me sick but I didnt know it would be so bad as this Tell
me does it always make people sick and do they ever die
Yes it usually makes them pretty sick Will answered But they
always get over it and each time they smoke they get more used to it
or something and after a while they dont get sick at all Look at me
It never makes me sick but it did at first Surely you can stand a
little sickness when you know that it is going to make a man of you
John concluded that under those circumstances he could endure his
suffering But he did not try to smoke any more that morning With
Wills assistance he found the doorway of the cellar and went out where
the air was more pure Gradually he began to feel better When dinner
time came however he did not care to eat but he kept repeating to
himself It wont be this way long and I can afford to suffer if it
will make a man of me How sad to think that one so young should be
so deceived
Could someone have taught him then that the sick feeling that had so
distressed him was caused by the strong poison contained in the tobacco
it might have encouraged him never to touch it again Had his father
explained that every pound of tobacco contains three hundred and twenty
grains of this poison one grain of which will kill a large dog in about
three minutes or told him the story of how a man once ran a needle and
thread that had been dipped in the poison through the skin of a frog and
of how the frog in a few moments began to act like a drunken person
vomited and hopped about as fast as possible and then laid down
twitched for a moment in agony and died or informed him that many
people become insane just through the use of tobacco John might have
yet been influenced to leave the poisonous stuff alonebut perhaps his
father did not know Anyway John was left without this muchneeded
information
Boys who are not properly warned of the danger of tobaccousing are to
be pitied more than blamed if they indulge but their ignorance does not
lessen the harm and the evils wrought When the poison gets into the
system it affects the most vital organs it undermines that strength
and destroys that beauty which ornament true manhood and which assure an
individual of success Besides the continued using causes the indulger
to form a habit that cannot be easily overcome
John being not fully warned of the dreadful consequences of using
tobacco and yet determined to become a man kept on smoking until he
so accustomed his system to the shock that he felt satisfied he was
becoming a conqueror and would soon be able to show his father that
he was now a man
During the time that John was undergoing such severe temptation his
father was very busy He realized that his child needed more instruction
than he was receiving and that Wills influence over John was not good
but just what advice to give he hardly knew Once he thought that he
could smell tobacco smoke on his boys clothing so calling John to his
side he said
John I feel that I must tell you something more about certain bad
habits that so many boys form while they are young You remember I told
you that smoking and chewing tobacco ruin many a life Now I am not
going to say that you cannot use tobacco but I wish that for my sake
as well as for your own you would let it alone for it is indeed a very
bad habit
To this advice John made no reply for an appetite was being formed
and in his heart he decided to keep right on It would have been better
could his father have remembered the temptations of his own boyhood
days He might then have more fully realized how next to impossible it
is for a parent to availingly teach his child to do something without
first setting before the child an example that is worthy of imitation
Could he have helped his little son to understand the true meaning of
manhood and the necessity of building up within himself in youth a
noble honest and alwaystobedependedupon character as well as the
need of developing a strong body he might have laid a foundation upon
which John could have later safely builded
John dearly loved his father and wanted to please him And to his mind
he could best please his father by as quickly as possible becoming a
man So with the thought of early manhood ever before him he felt
that in using tobacco he was doing right And then too Charley had
learned to smoke and chew and it would be very hard indeed to be near
the boys and not to join in with them
By the time that John had passed his seventh birthday the small amount
of tobacco that was kept in the cellar was not sufficient to fill the
demand of the three boys without too rapidly diminishing the uncles
supply and the boys decided to look elsewhere
Now Johns aunt had at one time explained to the boys that lying and
stealing are wrong but she had not made it clear that deceiving is
lying and that taking little things that did not belong to them even
though they took the things from some member of the family is stealing
and that just such thefts lead to the greater crimes that send men and
women to prison Instead she gave the advice in such a way that though
they were impressed with a horror of stealing the boys could only in
part comprehend her meaning But because she had warned them she felt
that she had done her duty and that they ought to know right from wrong
in regard to that matter without further explanation
She did not realize that it was her duty to watch encourage and
advise and also to find out when mischief was being planned In fact
this aunt and mother busy with her own cares knew nothing of the
possibilities for a child whose confidence and love had been won and
who through loving counsel had gained a knowledge of evils and their
effects before he had formed ruinous habits or his mind had been
polluted with false ideas Being thus left to themselves to discern as
best they could the difference between right and wrong the boys nearly
always chose the wrong and as a result constantly went deeper and
deeper into sinful things
CHAPTER III
What the Big Chest Contained
Great sins always have a beginning the first attempts to do evil are
not hard to check if taken in time but if allowed to be carried out it
is impossible to tell what the results may be How sad it was that John
and his cousins did not have someone to check them
The boys now decided to keep close watch and to avail themselves of
every opportunity to procure tobacco even if they were forced to steal
it The word steal had of course a certain horror to John because
of the picture his aunt had described of a prison and a thief but he
soothed his conscience by saying There isnt anything else in the
world except tobacco that I would think of stealing But the stealing
habit like the tobacco habit continues to grow stronger unless it
is in some way broken As tobacco contains a poison that affects the
physical being so in a similar manner lying and stealing have a ruinous
effect upon the moral nature The threelying stealing and tobacco
usingtoo often go hand in hand
The first effort of the boys to secure the muchcoveted tobacco was made
one day when they while roaming about over the prairie discovered a
man hard at work in a field The man seemed to be lifting something that
was very heavy and Will suggested to the boys that they go and lend
their services provided the man would give them each a chew of his
tobacco in return and Will did not forget to add that they must each
take as generous a bite as their mouths could accommodate The man was
glad to accept their help and together with his own efforts the work
was soon finished Then in fulfillment of his agreement he handed them
his plug of tobacco that they might each take the chew he had promised
them
According to Wills suggestion the boys did not stop with an ordinary
chew but each took all that his mouth would contain When they returned
the plug it was so small that the boys were all afraid the man would
find fault with them so they hurried away from the spot as rapidly as
possible As soon as they were far enough away they removed the tobacco
from their mouths and they found that by taking very small chews at
a time the amount was sufficient to last them for some time Several
times they succeeded in securing tobacco in this way and by economizing
were able to get along pretty well for a while But the plan did not
always work for the neighbors becoming aware of the scheme prepared
themselves with a small piece of tobacco to offer the greedy boys
After that in order to secure their tobacco they were often forced
to pick up partlychewed quids found where they had been thrown away
by the owners These the boys usually washed sometimes however in
their eagerness they could not wait to attend to even this amount of
cleanliness but crammed the tobacco into their mouths just as they had
found it Even cigar stubs in fact everything in the form of tobacco
that had been thrown away they eagerly gathered and used to satisfy
their ravenous appetites
With a foundation now laid for both lying and stealing and with their
consciences dulled the boys were constantly laying plans to gratify
their evil desires Many a pocket they robbed of its contents if it
happened to contain tobacco in any form But this was a slow process at
best even under the most favorable circumstances it yielded them but
very little returns for their efforts But one day Will informed the
boys that he had made a discoverythat he had found out that there was
a lot of plug tobacco in the big chest in his fathers room Now if we
could think up some way to get into that chest when the old folks are
gone away to town he suggested we could get all the chewing tobacco
we would want for a long while I thought I would watch and see where
Dad put the key but he took it with him Guess he carries it with him
everywhere he goes I wonder if we couldnt manage in some way to break
the lock My but I tell you we could get a big haul I wonder if we
hadnt better try it some day when the old folks go to town
Hooray thats just it shouted the smaller boys in the same breath
And John asked quickly When will they go to town again This is only
Wednesday
It wont be long Im sure Will answered reassuringly Theyll go
either Friday or Saturday sure But well have to get busy and think out
a way to break that lock My but wont the old man be mad when he finds
out about it Well have to act just as if we couldnt see how on earth
such a thing could have happened
Yes and well have to hide the tobacco good or Pa might find it
chimed in Charley
Hey Will John exclaimed in a hurried undertonefor all the boys had
learned to speak low when mentioning their plansif we could take the
hinges off from the back of the chest we wouldnt have to break the
lock at all
Why John thats just it How in the world did you think of that
scheme Will exclaimed as he slapped his little cousin on the back I
say my boy you had better look out or youll be a man before your big
cousin It doesnt matter you know about the height if you have the
sense
Now John although so young was quite ingenious and he often
suggested ideas that for their shrewdness were far beyond his years
For such he was always praised by Will and was encouraged to make other
plans
Being encouraged by his cousins praise the childs brain became even
more active and he said If we just cut a little piece from each plug
Uncle wont be so apt to miss the tobacco
Thats just it again emphatically assented Will I declare John
you surprise me And now we must have everything all ready so that
the minute they leave we can get busy Lets see whatll we need
A screwdriverand will we need a hammer
Well need a real sharp knife to cut the tobacco John suggested
Ill get the things ready Charley volunteered and so they planned
and waited for the time to come when they could carry out their scheme
The time came on the following Saturday Early in the morning the uncle
and aunt drove away in the buckboard and were on their way to the
city where they were to do their trading All three of the boys had been
unusually anxious to help their elders get started forgetting in their
eagerness that they might be thus revealing some of their plans
Scarcely did they give the uncle and aunt time to disappear in the
distance before they had commenced their evil work
Heres the tools Charley said as he brought forth the screwdriver
hammer and sharp knife Where shall I put them
Oh anywhere so theyll be handy Will told him and then the three
boys hastened to the room containing the chest and were soon kneeling on
the floor examining carefully the object of their interest
The chest a long narrow flat box somewhat darkened with age was
closed and securely fastened and the tiny padlock that hung from its
side seemed to say If you please I am here to protect my masters
property from the hand of any thieves and to the extent that it is
within my power I shall perform my duty Its bold front and defiant
appearance did not however daunt the purpose of the boys After giving
it a brief examination they slipped around to the opposite side of the
chest and by the aid of the screwdriver removed the lower half of the
rusty hinges
Thank goodness this chest is old Will exclaimed as he brushed from
his forehead the large beads of perspiration If these screws turned
any harder I never could get them out Guess well earn our tobacco
this time all right
Illustration Opening the Chest
Scarcely had the last screw been removed when up came the lid and
almost instantly three pairs of eager eyes were greedily gazing down
upon the contents of the wooden chest There were in it a package of
old letters various articles of clothing a few trinkets etc but
only that part of the contents that was carefully packed in one corner
claimed the attention of the boys This a pile of long brown strips
or plugs of tobacco was what they wanted and soon Will was busily
engaged in cutting a narrow slice from each plug and John and Charley
were dividing the slices into three equal parts But in their haste and
excitement none of the boys forgot to fill their mouths with the filthy
stuff and to chew while they worked
As Will cut a piece from the last plug he glanced about over the piles
and said with a look of satisfaction Now that aint so bad is it
boys That ought to last quite a spell and when its gone we can come
back here or maybe something else will turn up And then when he saw
the boys rearranging the tobacco in the chest he said Look out there
Youll have to get everything just like it was or well be caught and
have had our fun for nothing When the chest was repacked the last
screw in its place and the tiny scraps of tobacco that had fallen upon
the floor had been carefully preserved the boys looked at one another
with satisfaction and Will said Thats a pretty slick job all right
if I do say so and its a lot better than breaking the lock would have
been Ill tell you it takes some brains to do up a thing like that
and it makes me feel as if Id like more of them
To this John smiled and said Hey Will do you know whats in that
trunk John referred to a large trunk that was sitting near the bed
on the opposite side of the room
Couldnt tell you all thats in it but its locked and its in that
trunk that Dad keeps his revolvers Theres two of them because I saw
inside the trunk the other day And then as the new thought presented
itself to his mind he exclaimed I wonder why we couldnt get into
that trunk the same as we did the chest
In a twinkling all the boys were examining the trunk but to their
dismay they found that the hinges instead of being on the outside of
the trunk were arranged differently and they could not get at them
Again it was John who suggested a plan whereby they could accomplish
their desires Just take a nail he said and turn the head of it
around in the lock Ive watched my father do that and he gets his
open every time
The trunk which was an old one yielded quickly to the efforts made
by the boys and upon raising the lid they saw before them two shining
weapons that were supposed to have been carefully hidden away from their
inexperienced fingers John and Will each quickly caught one up in his
hand and Will began handling his as though it were a toy but not so
did John
Johns father had taught him something of the dangers connected with the
handling of a gun or revolver Besides John was at one time present
when a duel was fought and on that occasion one of the duelists was
killed The memory of that incident and of his fathers warnings made
John very careful about pointing the revolver at either of his cousins
It was therefore with intense fear that John looked into the barrel
of his cousins revolver as Will snapped it aimlessly pointing in his
direction and John exclaimed Turn that thing away or youll shoot
me
Wills answer was You neednt be afraid John This revolver isnt
loaded
But John seeing his cousins careless attitude was afraid and he
dodged down behind a barrel of carpetrags near which he had been
standing It was well that John did not longer remain where he had been
for the revolver contained a solitary load and the frequent pulling of
the trigger discharged this The bullet passed the very spot where John
had a moment before been standing and lodged itself deep in the side of
the trunk
This experience marked an awakeningtime in all of the boys lives at
that moment their consciences which had almost fallen asleep were
aroused and in startling phrases gave them accounts of their evil
deeds With great haste the boys returned the weapons to their former
hiding place relocked the trunk and in so far as it was possible
covered all the traces of the accident Then with hearts full of guilty
thoughts the three boys hastened from the place where a scene of horror
had very nearly been enacted
Out in the open where the air was fresh and pure their spirits to a
certain degree revived But their usual laughter fun and merrymaking
had been dampened and as they wended their way to the prairie
pastureland few words were passed between them Poor little misguided
boys warned and yet left so ignorant of what was the right and the
wrong way
Through the voice of conscience God endeavored to speak to John and to
tell him that his ways were evil and that he and his cousins would some
day get into serious trouble if they continued in the way they were
going but although he was sad he could not understand He wanted to
be a good boy for his fathers sake for his father was the best friend
he knew and most of all he desired to become the man that that parent
had wished him to be Johns disregard for his fathers warnings from
time to time had been due to the fear that if he obeyed his early
