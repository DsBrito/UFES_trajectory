to sound and while Faith has an ear of exquisite delicacy on her
sightless orbs as she lifts them towards heaven the sunbeam plays in
vain Hand in hand the brother and sister in all mutual love pursue
their way through a world on which like ours day breaks and night
falls alternate by day the eyes of Reason are the guide of Faith and
by night the ear of Faith is the guide of Reason As is wont with those
who labour under these privations respectively Reason is apt to be
eager impetuous impatient of that instruction which his infirmity will
not permit him readily to apprehend while Faith gentle and docile is
ever willing to listen to the voice by which alone truth and wisdom can
effectually reach her
It has been shown by Butler in the fourth and fifth chapters Part I
of his great work that the entire constitution and condition of man
viewed in relation to the present world alone and consequently all the
analogies derived from that fact in relation to a future world suggest
the conclusion that we are here the subjects of a probation discipline
or in a course of education for another state of existence But it
has not perhaps been sufficiently insisted on that if in the actual
course of that education of which enlightened obedience to the law
of virtue as Butler expresses it or which is the same thing to the
dictates of supreme wisdom and goodness is the great end we give an
unchecked ascendency to either Reason or Faith we vitiate the whole
process The chief instrument by which that process is carried on is
not Reason alone or Faith alone but their wellbalanced and reciprocal
interaction It is a system of alternate checks and limitations in
which Reason does not supersede Faith nor Faith encroach on Reason But
our meaning will be more evident when we have made one or two remarks
on what are conceived to be their respective provinces In the domain
of Reason men generally include 1st what are called intuitions
2d necessary deductions from them and 3d deductions from their own
direct experience while in the domain of Faith are ranked all truths
and propositions which are received not without reasons indeed but
for reasons underived from the intrinsic evidence whether intuitive or
deductive or from our own experience of propositions themselvesfor
reasons such as credible testimony for example extrinsic to the
proper meaning and significance of such propositions although such
reasons by accumulation and convergency may be capable of subduing
the force of any difficulties or improbabilities which cannot be
demonstrated to involve absolute contradictions
Of the first kind of truths or those received by intuition we have
examples in what are called selfevident axioms and fundamental
laws or conditions of thought which no wise man has ever attempted
to prove Of the second we have examples in the whole fabric of
mathematical science reared from its basis of axioms and definitions
as well as in every other necessary deduction from admitted premises
The third virtually includes any conclusion in science based on direct
experiment or observation though the belief of the truth even of
Newtons system of the world when received as Locke says he received
and as the generality of men receive itwithout being able to follow
the steps by which the great geometer proves his conclusionsmay be
represented rather as an act of faith rather than an act of Reason
as much so as a belief in the truth of Christianity founded on its
historic and other evidences The greater part of mans knowledge
indeed even of scienceeven the greater part of a scientific mans
knowledge of science based as it is on testimony alone and which
so often compels him to renounce today what he thought certain
yesterdaymay be not unjustly considered as more allied to Faith than
Reason It may be said perhaps that the above classification of the
truths received by Reason and Faith respectively is arbitrary that
even as to some of their alleged sources they are not always clearly
distinguishable that the evidence of experience may in some sort
be reduced to testimonythat of sense and testimony reduced to
experiencethat of human veracity under given circumstances both
being founded upon the observed uniformity of certain phenomena under
similar conditions We admit the truth of this and we admit it the more
willingly as it shows that so inextricably intertwined are the roots
both of Reason and Faith in our nature that no definitions that can be
framed will completely separate them none that will not involve many
phenomena which may be said to fall under the dominion of one as much as
the other We have been content for our practical purpose without
any too subtle refinement to take the line of demarcation which is
perhaps as obvious as any and as generally recognised Few would say
that a generalised inference from direct experience was not matter of
reason rather than of faith though an act of faith is involved in
the process and few would not call confidence in testimony where
probabilities were nearly balanced by the name of faith rather than
reason though an act of reason is involved in that process We are much
more anxious to show their general involution with one another than the
points of discrimination between them
In receiving important doctrines on the strength of such evidence and
in holding to them against the perplexities they involve or what is
harder still against the prejudices they oppose every exercise of
an intelligent faith will on analysis be found to consist its only
necessary limit will be proven contradictions in the propositions
submitted to it for then no evidence can justify belief or even
render it possible But no other difficulties however great will
justify unbelief where man has all that he can justly demandevidence
such in its nature as he can deal with and on which he is accustomed
to act in his most important affairs in this world thus admitting
its validity and such in amount as to render it more likely that the
doctrines it substantiates are true than from mere ignorance of the
mode in which these difficulties can be solved he can infer them to be
false Probabilities says Bishop Bulter are to us the very guide
to life and when the probabilities arise out of evidence which we
are competent to pronounce and the improbabilities merely from our
surmises where we have no evidence to deal with and perhaps from the
limitation of our capacities could not deal with it if we had it it
is not difficult to see what course practical wisdom tells man he ought
to pursue and which he always does pursue whatever difficulties beset
himin all cases except one
Such is the strict unionthat mutual dependence of Reason and
Faithwhich would seem to be the great law under which the moral school
in which we are being educated is conducted This law is equally or
almost equally its characteristic Whether we regard man simply in
his present condition or in his present in relation to his future
conditionas an inhabitant only of this world or a candidate for
another and to this law by a series of analogies as striking as any
of those which Butler has pointed out and on which we heartily wish his
comprehensive genius had expended a chapter or two Christianity
in the demands it makes on both principles conjointly is evidently
adapted
Men often speak indeed as if the exercise of faith was excluded from
their condition as inhabitants of the present world But it requires
but a very slight consideration to show that the boasted prerogative of
reason is here also that of a limited monarch and that its attempts to
make itself absolute can only end in its own dethronement and after
successive revolutions in all the anarchy of absolute pyrrhonism
For in the intellectual and moral education of man considered merely
as a citizen of the present world we see the constant and inseparable
union of the two principles and provision made for their perpetual
exercise He cannot advance a step indeed without both We see faith
demanded not only amidst the dependence and ignorance in which childhood
and youth are passed not only in the whole process by which we acquire
the imperfect knowledge which is to fit us for being men but to
the very last we may be truly said to believe far more than we know
Indeed said Butler the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence with
which we are obliged to take up in the daily course of life is scarce
to be expected Nay in an intelligible sense even the primary
truths or first principles or fundamental laws of thought or
selfevident maxims or intuitions or by whatever other names
philosophers have been pleased to designate them which in a special
sense are the very province of reason as contradistinguished from
reasoning or logical deduction may be said almost as truly to depend
on faith as on reason for their reception For the only ground for
believing them true is that man cannot help so believing them The same
may be said of that great fact without which the whole world would
be at a standstilla belief in the uniformity of the phenomena of
external nature that the same sun for example which rose yesterday
and today will rise again tomorrow That this cannot be demonstrated
is admitted on all hands and that it is not absolutely proved from
experience is evident both from the fact that the uniformity supposed
is only accepted as partially and transiently true the great bulk
of mankind even while they so confidently act upon that uniformity
rejecting the idea of its being an eternal uniformity Every theist
believes that the order of the universe once began to be and every
Christian and most other men believe that it will also one day cease to
be
Common language seems to indicate this Since we call that disposition
of mind which leads some men to deny the above fundamental truths or
affect to deny them not by a word which indicates the opposite of
reason but the opposite of faithScepticism Unbelief Incredulity
But perhaps the most striking example of the helplessness to which man
is soon reduced if he relies upon his reason alone is The spectacle
of the issue of his investigations into that which one would imagine he
must know most intimately if he knows anything and that is his own
naturehis own mind There is something to one who reflects long
enough upon it inexpressibly whimsical in the questions which the mind
is for ever putting to itself respecting itself and to which the said
mind returns from its dark caverns only an echo We are apt when we
speculate about the mind to forget for the moment that it is at once
the querist and the oracle and to regard it as something out of itself
like a mineral in the hands of the analytic chemist We cannot fully
enter into the absurdities of its condition except by remembering that
it is our own wise selves who so grotesquely bewilder us The mind on
such occasions takes itself if we may so speak into its own hands
turns itself about itself listens to the echo of its own voice and
is obliged after all to lay itself down again with a very puzzled
expressionand acknowledge that of its very self itself knows little
or nothing I am material exclaims one of those whimsical beings
to whom the heavendescended Know thyself would seem to have been
ironically addressed Noimmaterial says another I am both
material and immaterial exclaims perhaps the very same mind at
different times Thought itself may be matter modified says one
Rather says another of the same perplexed species matter is
thought modified for what you call matter is but a phenomenon But are
independent and totally distinct substances mysteriously inexplicably
conjoined says a third How they are conjoined we know no more than
the dead Not so much perhaps Do I ever cease to think says the
mind to itself even in sleep Is not my essence thought You
ought to know your own essence best all creation will reply I am
confident says one that I never do cease to thinknot even in the
soundest sleep You do for a long time every night of your life
exclaims another equally confident and equally ignorant Where do I
exist it goes on Am I in the brain Am I in the whole body Am I
anywhere Am I nowhere I cannot have any local existence for I know
I am immaterial says one I have a local existence because I am
material says another I have a local existence though I am not
material says a third Are my habitual actions voluntary it
exclaims however rapid they become though I am unconscious of these
volitions when they have attained a certain rapidity or do I become a
mere automaton as respects such actions and therefore an automaton nine
times out of ten when I act at all To this query two opposite answers
are given by different minds and by others perhaps wiser none at all
while often opposite answers are given by the same mind at different
times In like manner has every action every operation every emotion
of the mind been made the subject of endless doubt and disputation
Surely if as Soame Jenyns imagined the infirmities of man and even
graver evils were permitted in order to afford amusement to superior
intelligences and make the angels laugh few things could afford them
better sport than the perplexities of this child of clay engaged in the
study of himself Alas exclaims at last the baffled spirit of this
babe in intellect as he surveys his shattered toyshis broken theories
of metaphysics I know that I am but what I amwhere I ameven how
I actnot only what is my essence but what even my mode of
operationof all this I know nothing and boast of reason as I may
all that I think on these points is matter of opinionor is matter
of faith He resembles in fact nothing so much as a kitten first
introduced to its own image in a mirror she runs to the back of it
she leaps over it she turns and twists and jumps and frisks in all
directions in the vain attempt to reach the fair illusion and at
length turns away in weariness from that incomprehensible enigmathe
image of herself
One would imagineperhaps not untrulythat the Divine Creator had
subjected us to these difficultiesand especially that incomprehensible
trilemmathat there is an union and interaction of two totally
distinct substances or that matter is but thought or that thought is
but matterone of which must be true and all of which approach as
near to the mutual contradictions as can well be conceivedfor the
very purpose of rebuking the presumption of man and of teaching him
humility that He had left these obscurities at the very thresholdnay
within the very mansion of the mind itselffor the express purpose of
deterring man from playing the dogmatising fool when he looked abroad
Yet in spite of his raggedness and poverty at home no sooner does man
look out of his dusky dwelling than like Goldsmiths little Beau
who in his garret up five pair of stairs boasts of his friendship with
lords he is apt to assume airs of magnificence and glancing at
the infinite through his little eyeglass to affect an intimate
acquaintance with the most respectable secrets of the universe
It is undeniable then that the perplexities which uniformly puzzle
man in the physical world and even in the little world of his own mind
when he passes a certain limit are just as unmanageable as those found
in the moral constitution and government of the universe or in the
disclosures of the volume Revelation In both we find abundance of
inexplicable difficulties sometimes arising from our absolute
ignorance and perhaps quite as often from our partial knowledge These
difficulties are probably left on the pages of both volumes for some of
the same reasons many of them it may be because even the commentary
of the Creator himself could not render them plain to finite
understanding though a necessary and salutary exercise of our humility
may be involved in their reception others if not purely which seems
not probable yet partly for the sake of exercising and training that
humility as an essential part of the education of a child others
surmountable indeed in the progress of knowledge and by prolonged
effort of the human intellect may be designed to stimulate that
intellect to strenuous action and healthy effortas well as to supply
in their solution as time rolls on an everaccumulating mass of proofs
of the profundity of the wisdom which has so far anticipated all the
wisdom of man and of the divine origin of both the great books which
he is privileged to study as a pupil and even to illustrate as a
commentatorbut the text of which he cannot alter
But for submitting to us many profound and insoluble problems the
second of the above reasonsthe training of the intellect and heart of
man to submission to the Supreme Intelligence alone be sufficient
For it as is indicated by every thing in human nature and by the
representations of Scripture which are in analogy with both the
present world is but the school of man in this the childhood of his
being to prepare him for the enjoyment of an immortal manhood in
another everything might be expected to be subordinated to this
great end and as the end of that education can be no other than an
enlightened obedience to God the harmonious and concurrent exercise
of reason and faith becomes absolutely necessarynot of reason to the
exclusion of faith for otherwise there would be no adequate test of
mans docility and submission nor of a faith that would assert itself
not only independent of reason but in contradiction to itwhich
would not be what God requires and what alone can quadrate with that
intelligent nature He has impressed on His offspringa reasonable
obedience Implicit obedience then to the dictates of an allperfect
wisdom exercised amidst many difficulties and perplexities as so many
tests of sincerity and yet sustained by evidences which justify the
conclusions which involve them would seem to be the great object of
mans moral education here and to justify both the partial evidence
addressed to his reason and the abundant difficulties which it leaves
to his faith The evidence of religion says Butler is fully
sufficient for all the purposes of probation how far soever it is from
being satisfactory as to the purposes of curiosity or any other and
indeed it answers the purposes of the former in several respects which
it would not do if it were as overbearing as is required Or as
Pascal beautifully puts itThere is light enough for those whose
sincere wish is to seeand darkness enough to confound those of an
opposite disposition

151 The views here developed will be found an expansion of some brief
hints at the close of the article on Pascals Life and Genius Ed
Review Jan 1847 though our space then prevented us from more than
touching these topics We may add that we gladly take this opportunity
of pointing the attention of our readers to a tract of Archbishop
Whatelys entitled The example of children as proposed to Christians
which his Grace having been struck with a coincidence between some of
the thoughts in the tract and those expressed in the Review did us
the favour to transmit to us Had we seen the tract before we should
have been glad to illustrate and confirm our own views by those of this
highly gifted prelate We earnestly recommend the tract in question
as well as the whole of the remarkable volume in which it is now
incorporated Essays on some of the Peculiarities of the Christian
Religion to the perusal of our readers and at the same time venture
to express our conviction having been led by the circumstances above
mentioned to a fuller acquaintance with his Graces theological writings
than we had previously possessed that though this lucid and eloquent
writer may for obvious reasons be most widely known by his Logic and
Rhetoric the time will come when his Theological works will be
if not more widely read still more highly prized To great powers of
argument and illustration and delightful transparency of diction and
style he adds a higher quality stilland a very rare quality it isan
evident and intense honesty of purpose an absorbing desire to arrive at
the exact truth and to state it with perfect fairness and with the
just limitations Without pretending to agree with all that Archbishop
Whately has written on the subject of theology though be carries
his readers with him as frequently as any writer with whom we are
acquainted we may remark that in relation to that whole class of
subjects to which the present essay has reference we know of no
writer of the present day whose contributions are more numerous or more
valuable The highly ingenious ironical brochure entitled Historic
Doubts relative to Napoleon Buonaparte the Essays above mentioned On
some of the Peculiarities of the Christian Religion those On some of
the Dangers to Christian Faith and on the Errors of Romanism the
work on the Kingdom of Christ not to mention others are well worthy
of universal perusal They abound in views both original and just
stated with all the authors aptness of illustration and transparency of
language We may remark too that in many of his occasional sermons
he has incidentally added many most beautiful fragments to that ever
accumulating mass of internal evidence which the Scriptures themselves
supply in their very structure and which is evolved by diligent
investigation of the relation and coherence of one part of them with
another We are also rejoiced to see that a small and unpretending but
very powerful little tract by the same writer entitled Introductory
Lessons on Christian Evidences has passed through many editions has
been translated into most of the European languages and amongst
the rest very recently into German with an appropriate preface
by professor Abeltzhauser of the University of Dublin It shows
to demonstration that as much of the evidence of Christianity as is
necessary for conviction may be made perfectly clear to the meanest
capacity and that in spite of the assertions of Rome and of Oxford to
the contrary the apostolic injunction to every Christian to be ready
to render a reason for the hope that is in himsomewhat better than
that no reason of the Hindoo or the Hottentot that he believes what he
is told without any reason except that he is told itis an injunction
possible to obey
As He who spake as never man spake is pleased often to illustrate
the conduct of the Father of Spirits to his intelligent offspring by
a reference to the conduct which flows from the relations of the
human parent to his children so the present subject admits of similar
illustration What God does with us in that process of moral education
to which we have just adverted is exactly what every wise parent
endeavours to do with his childrenthough by methods as we may
well judge proportionably less perfect Man too instinctively or by
reflection adapts himself to the nature of his children and seeing
that only so far as it is justly trained can they be happy makes the
harmonious and concurrent development of their reason and their faith
his object he too endeavours to teach them that without which they
cannot be happyobedience but a reasonable obedience He gives them
in his general procedure and conduct sufficient proof of his superior
knowledge superior wisdom and unchanging love and secure in the
general effect of this he leaves them to receive by faith many things
which he cannot explain to them if he would till they get older many
things which he can only partially explain and others which he might
more perfectly explain but will not partly as a test of their docility
and partly to invite and necessitate the healthy and energetic exercise
of their reason in finding out the explanation for themselves Confiding
in the same general effect of his procedure and conduct he does not
hesitate when the foresight of their ultimate welfare justifies it to
draw still more largely on their faith in acts of apparent harshness
and severity Time he knows will show though perhaps not till his
yearning heart has ceased to beat for their welfare that all that all
he did he did in love He knows too that if his lessons are taken
aright and his children become the good and happy men he wishes them to
be they will say as they visit his sepulchre and recall with sorrow
the once unappreciated love which animated himand perhaps with a
sorrow deeper still remember the transient resentments caused by a
solitary severity He was indeed a friend he corrected us not for his
pleasure but for our profit and what we once thought was caprice or
passion we now know was love
These analogies afford a true though most imperfect representation of
the moral discipline to which Supreme Wisdom is subjecting us and as we
are accustomed to despair of any child with whom parental experience and
authority go for nothing unless he can fully understand the intrinsic
reasons for every special act of duty which that experience and
authority dictate as we are sure that he who has not learned to obey
when young will never when of age know how to govern either himself
or others so a singular conduct in all the children of dust towards the
Father of Spirits justifies a still more gloomy augury inasmuch as the
difference between the knowledge of man and the ignorance of a child
absolutely vanishes in comparison with that interval which must ever
subsist between the knowledge of the Eternal and the ignorance of man
The remarks that have been made are not uncalled for in the present day
For unfortunately it is now easy to detect in many classes of minds
a tendency to divorce Reason from Faith or Faith from reason and to
proclaim that what God hath joined together shall henceforth exist in
alienation We see this tendency manifested in relation both to Natural
Theology and to Revealed Religion The old conflict between the claims
of these two guiding principles of man in no age wholly suppressed
is visibly renewed in our day In relation to Christianity especially
there are large classes amongst us who press the claims of faith so far
that it would become if they had their will an utterly unreasonable
faith some of whom do not scruple to speak slightingly of the evidences
which substantiate Christianity to decry and depreciate the study of
them to pronounce that study unnecessary and even in many cases
to insinuate their insufficiency They are loud in the mean time in
extolling a faith which as Whately truly observes is no whit better
than the faith of a heathen who has no other or better reason to offer
for his religion than that his father told him it was true But
this plainly is not the intelligent faith which as we have seen is
everywhere inculcated and applauded in the Scriptures it is not that
faith by which Christianity appealing In the midst of a multitude of
such traditional religions to palpable evidence addressed to mans
senses and understandings in a way no other religion ever did
everywhere destroyed the systems for which their votaries could only say
that their fathers told them they were true And yet this blind belief
in such tradition many advocates of Christianity would now enjoin us to
imitate It might have occurred to them one would think that on their
principles Christianity never could have succeeded for every mind must
have been hopelessly preoccupied against all examination of its claims
It is indeed incomparably better that a man should be a sincere
Christian even by an utterly unreasoning and passive faith if that be
possible than no Christian at all but at the best such a man is a
possessor of the truth only by accident he ought to have and if he
be a sincere disciple of truth will seek some more solid grounds for
holding it But it is but too obvious we fear that the disposition to
enjoin this obsequious mood of mind is prompted by a strong desire
to revive the ancient empire of priestcraft and the pretensions of
ecclesiastical despotism to secure readmission to the human mind of
extravagant and preposterous claims which their advocates are sadly
conscious rest on no solid foundation They feel that reason is not with
them it must be against them and reason therefore they are determined
to exclude
But the experience of the present developments of Oxford teaching
may serve to show us how infinitely perilous is this course and how
fearfully both outraged reason and outraged faith will avenge the
wrongs done them by their alienation and disjunction Those results
indeed we predicted in 1843 before a single leader of the Oxford
school had gone over to Rome and before any tendencies to the opposite
extreme of Scepticism had manifested themselves We then affirmed that
on the one hand those who were contending for the corruptions of
the fourth century could not possibly find footing there but must
inevitably seek their ultimate resting place in Romea prediction which
has been too amply fulfilled and that on the other the extravagant
pretensions put forth on behalf of an uninquiring faith and the
desperate assertion that the evidence for Christianity was no stronger
than that for Church Principles must by reaction lead on to an
outbreak of infidelity That prophecy too has been to the letter
accomplished We then said
We have seen it recently asserted by some of the Oxford school that
there is as much reason for rejecting the most essential doctrines of
Christianitynay Christianity itselfas for rejecting their church
principles That in short we have as much reason for being infidels
as for rejecting the doctrine of Apostolical succession What other
effect such reasoning can have than that of compelling men to believe
that there is nothing between infidelity and popery and of urging them
to make a selection between the two we know not  Indeed we fully
expect that as a reaction of the present extravagancies of the revival
of obsolete superstition we shall have ere long to fight over again the
battle with a modified form of infidelity as now with a modified form
of popery Thus probably for some time to come will the human
mind continue to oscillate between the extremes of error but with a
diminished are at each vibration until truth shall at last prevail and
compel it to repose in the centre
Oxford Tract School Ed Rev April 1843
The offensive displays of selfsufficiency and flippancy of ignorance
and presumption found in the productions of the apostles of the
new infidelity of Oxford of which we shall have a few words to say
byandby are the natural and instructive though most painful result
of attempting to give predominance to one principle of our nature where
two or more are designed reciprocally to guard and check each other and
such results must ever follow such attempts The excellence of manso
complexly constituted is his naturemust consist in the harmonious
action and proper balance of all the constituents of that nature the
equilibrium he sighs for must be the result of the combined action of
forces operating in different directions of his reason his faith his
appetites his affections his emotions when these operate each in
due proportion then and then only can he be at rest It may indeed
transcend any calculus of man to estimate exactly the several elements
in this complicated polygon of forces but we are at least sure that
if any one principle be so developed as to supersede another no safe
equipoise will be attained We all know familiarly enough that this is
the case when the affections or the appetites are more powerful than the
reason and the conscience instead of being in subjection to them but
it is not less the case though the result is not so palpable when
reason and faith either exclude one another or trench on each others
domain when one is pampered and the other starved Hence the perils
attendant upon their attempted separation and the ruin which results
from their actual alienation and hostility There is no depth of
dreary superstition into which men may not sink in the one case and no
extravagance of ignorant presumption to which they may not soar in the
other It is only by the mutual and alternate action of these different
forces that man can safely navigate his little bark through the narrow
straits and by the dangerous rocks which impede his course and if Faith
spread not the sail to the breeze or if Reason desert the helm we are
in equal peril
It has been our lot to meet with disciples of the Oxford Tract School
who have by a fatal indulgence of an appetite of belief brought
themselves to believe any mediaeval miracle nay any ghost story
without examination saying with a solemn face It is better to
believe that to reason They believe as they will to believe and thus
is reason avenged Reason similarly indulged believes with Mr Foxton
and Mr Froude that a miracle is even an impossibility and this is the
Nemesis of faith
If it be said that this is a disconsolate and dreary doctrine that man
seeks and needs a simpler navigation than this troublesome and intricate
course by star and chart compass and lead line and that this
responsibility of ever
Sounding on his dim and perilous way
