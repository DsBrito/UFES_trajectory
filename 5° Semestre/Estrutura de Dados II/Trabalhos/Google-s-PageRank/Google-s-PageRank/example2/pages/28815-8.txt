suggested the title of his romance was no fabric of the imagination
but was a great natural bridge that in early days spanned the
Columbia and later according to tradition was destroyed by an
earthquake
Before his death the author had the satisfaction of knowing that his
work was stamped with the approval of the press and the public his
satisfaction would have been more complete could he have foreseen that
that approval would be so lasting

PREFACE
In attempting to present with romantic setting a truthful and
realistic picture of the powerful and picturesque Indian tribes that
inhabited the Oregon country two centuries ago the author could not
be indifferent to the many serious difficulties inseparable from such
an enterprise Of the literary success with which his work has been
accomplished he must of course leave others to judge but he may
without immodesty speak briefly of his preparation for his task and
of the foundation of some of the facts and legends which form the
framework of his story Indian life and character have long been a
favorite study with him and in these pages he has attempted to
describe them not from an ideal standpoint but as he knew them in
his own boyhood on the Upper Columbia Many of the incidents related
in the story have come under his personal observation others have
been told him by aged pioneers or gleaned from old books of
Northwestern travel The everyday life of the Indians their food
their dress their methods of making their mats of building their
houses of shaping their canoes their gambling games their religious
beliefs their legends their subjects of conversation the sports and
pastimes of their childrenall these have been studied at first
hand and with the advantages of familiar and friendly intercourse
with these people in their own homes By constant questioning many
facts have been gained regarding their ancestry and the fragments of
history tradition and legend that have come down from them Indian
antiquities have been studied through every available source of
information All the antiquarian collections in Oregon and California
have been consulted old tradingposts visited and old pioneers and
early missionaries conversed with Nothing has been discarded as
trivial or insignificant that could aid in the slightest degree in
affording an insight into Indian character and customs of a bygone
age
As to the great Confederacy of the Wauna it may be said that Grays
History of Oregon tells us of an alliance of several tribes on the
Upper Columbia for mutual protection and defence and students of
Northwestern history will recall the great confederacy that the Yakima
warchief Kamyakin formed against the whites in the war of 1856 when
the Indian tribes were in revolt from the British Possessions to the
California line Signalfires announcing war against the whites leaped
from hill to hill flashing out in the night till the line of fire
beginning at the wild Okanogan ended a thousand miles south on the
foothills of Mount Shasta Knowing such a confederacy as this to be
an historical fact there seems nothing improbable in that part of the
legend which tells us that in ancient times the Indian tribes on
either side of the Cascade Range united under the great warchief
Multnomah against their hereditary foes the Shoshones Even this would
not be so extensive a confederacy as that which Kamyakin formed a
hundred and fifty years later
It may be asked if there was ever a great natural bridge over the
Columbiaa Bridge of the Gods such as the legend describes The
answer is emphatically Yes Everywhere along the midColumbia the
Indians tell of a great bridge that once spanned the river where the
cascades now are but where at that time the placid current flowed
under an arch of stone that this bridge was tomanowos built by the
gods that the Great Spirit shook the earth and the bridge crashed
down into the river forming the present obstruction of the cascades
All of the Columbian tribes tell this story in different versions and
in different dialects but all agreeing upon its essential features as
one of the great facts of their past history
Ancutta long time back say the Tumwater Indians the salmon he
no pass Tumwater falls It too much big leap Snake Indian he no catch
um fish above falls By and by great tomanowos bridge at cascades he
fall in dam up water make river higher all way up to Tumwater then
salmon he get over Then Snake Indian all time catch um plenty
My father talk one time said an old Klickitat to a pioneer at White
Salmon Washington long time ago liddle boy him in canoe his
mother paddle paddle up Columbia then come to tomanowos bridge
Squaw paddle canoe under all dark under bridge He look up all like
one big roof shut out sky no see um sun Indian afraid paddle
quick get past soon no good Liddle boy no forget how bridge look
Local proof also is not wanting In the fall when the freshets are
over and the waters of the Columbia are clear one going out in a
small boat just above the cascades and looking down into the
transparent depths can see submerged forest trees beneath him still
standing upright as they stood before the bridge fell in and the river
was raised above them It is a strange weird sight this forest
beneath the river the waters wash over the broken treetops fish
swim among the leafless branches it is desolate spectrelike beyond
all words Scientific men who have examined the field with a view to
determining the credibility of the legend about the bridge are
convinced that it is essentially true Believed in by many tribes
attested by the appearance of the locality and confirmed by
geological investigation it is surely entitled to be received as a
historic fact
The shipwreck of an Oriental vessel on the Oregon coast which
furnishes one of the most romantic elements in our story is an
altogether probable historic incident as explained more fully in a
footnote on page 75
The spelling of Indian names in which authorities differ so widely
has been made as accurate as possible and as in the name Wallulah
the oldest and most Indianlike form has been chosen An exception has
been made in the case of the modernized and corrupted Willamette
which is used instead of the original Indian name Wallamet But the
meaningless Willamette has unfortunately passed into such general
use that one is almost compelled to accept it Another verbal
irregularity should be noticed Wauna the name given by all the
Indians in the story to the Columbia was only the Klickitat name for
it The Indians had no general name for the Columbia but each tribe
had a special name if any for it Some had no name for it at all It
was simply the big water the river the big salmon water
What Wauna the Klickitat name or Wemath the Wasco name signifies
the author has been unable to learn even from the Indians who gave
him the names They do not know they say their fathers knew but it
is forgotten now
A rich and splendid treasure of legend and lore has passed away with
the old pioneers and the Indians of the earlier generation All that
may be found interesting in this or any other book on the Indians
compared to what has been lost is like a torn leaf from some old
romance

What tall and tawny men were these
As sombre silent as the trees
They moved among and sad some way
With tempered sadness ever they
Yet not with sorrow born of fear
The shadows of their destinies
They saw approaching year by year
And murmured not
They turned to death as to a sleep
And died with eager hands held out
To reaching hands beyond the deep
And died with choicest bow at hand
And quiver full and arrow drawn
For use when sweet tomorrows dawn
Should wake them in the Spirit Land

CHAPTER I
THE NEW ENGLAND MEETING
Such as sit in darkness and the shadow of deathBible
One Sabbath morning more than two hundred years ago the dawn broke
clear and beautiful over New England It was one of those lovely
mornings that seem like a benediction a smile of God upon the earth
so calm are they so full of unutterable rest and quiet Over the sea
with its endless line of beach and promontory washed softly by the
ocean swells over the towns of the coastBoston and Salemalready
large giving splendid promise of the future over the farms and
hamlets of the interior and into the rude clearings where the outer
limits of civilization mingled with the primeval forest came a flood
of light as the sun rose above the blue line of eastern sea And still
beyond across the Alleghanies into the depth of the wilderness
passed the sweet calm radiance as if bearing a gleam of gospel
sunshine to the Indians of the forest
Nowhere did the Sunday seem more peaceful than in a sheltered valley
in Massachusetts Beautiful indeed were the thrifty orchards the
rustic farmhouses the meadows where the charred stumps that marked
the last clearing were festooned with running vines the fields green
with Indian corn and around all the sweep of hills dark with the
ancient wood Even the grim unpainted meetinghouse on the hill which
was wont to look the very personification of the rigid Calvinistic
theology preached within it seemed a little less bare and forbidding
on that sweet June Sabbath
As the hour for morning service drew near the drummer took his
accustomed stand before the church and began to thunder forth his
summonsa summons not unfitting those stern Puritans whose idea of
religion was that of a lifelong warfare against the world the flesh
and the devil
Soon the people began to gathergrave men and women dressed in the
sobercolored garb of the day and little children clad in their
Sunday best undergoing the awful process of going to meeting yet
some of them at least looking at the cool shadowed wood as they
passed and thinking how pleasant it would be to hunt berries or
birds nests in those sylvan retreats instead of listening to a two
hours sermon under imminent danger of perdition if they went to
sleepfor in such seductive guise did the Evil One tempt the souls
of these youthful Puritans Solemn of visage and garb were the groups
although here and there the gleam of a bit of ribbon at the throat of
some young maiden or a bonnet tastefully adorned showed that the
world the flesh and the devil were not yet wholly subdued among
them
As the audience filed through the open door the men and women
divided the former taking one side of the house the latter the
otherthe aisle forming a dividing line between them The floor was
uncarpeted the walls bare the pulpit undraped and upon it the
hourglass stood beside the open Bible Anything more stiff and barren
than the interior of the meetinghouse it would be difficult to find
An unwonted stir breaks the silence and solemnity of the waiting
congregation as an official party enters It is the Governor of the
colony and his staff who are making a tour of the province and have
stopped over Sunday in the little frontier settlementfor although
the Governor is an august man even he may not presume to travel on
the Sabbath in this land of the Puritans The newcomers are richly
dressed There is something heavy massive and splendid in their
garb especially in the Governors He is a stately militarylooking
man and wears his ample vestments his embroidered gloves his lace
and ruffles with a magisterial air
A rustle goes through the audience as the distinguished visitors pass
up the aisle to the front seats assigned as the custom was to
dignitaries Young people steal curious glances at them children turn
around in their seats to stare provoking divers shakes of the head
from their elders and in one instance the boxing of an ear at which
the culprit sets up a smothered howl is ignominiously shaken and
sits swelling and choking with indignant grief during the remainder of
the service
At length the drum ceased indicating both the arrival of the minister
and the time for service to begin
The minister took his place in the pulpit He was a young man of
delicate mould with a pale and intellectual face Exquisite
sensitiveness was in the large gray eyes the white brow the delicate
lips the long slender fingers yet will and energy and command were
in them all His was that rare union of extreme sensibility with
strong resolution that has given the world its religious leadersits
Savonarolas and Chrysostoms men whose nerves shrank at a discord in
music but when inspired by some grand cause were like steel to
suffer and endure
Something of this was in the ministers aspect as he stood before the
people that morning His eyes shone and dilated and his slight figure
gathered dignity as his gaze met that of the assembly There was no
organ that instrument being deemed a device of the Prince of Darkness
to lead the hearts of the unwary off to popery but the opening hymn
was heartily sung Then came the Scripture readingusually a very
monotonous performance on the part of Puritan divines but as given in
the young ministers thoughtfully modulated voice nothing could have
been more expressive Every word had its meaning every metaphor was a
picture the whole psalm seemed to breathe with life and power Lord
thou hast been our dwellingplace in all generations
Majestic mournful yet thrilling with deathless hope was the
ministers voice and the people were deeply moved The prayer
followednot the endless monologue of the average Puritan
clergyman but pointed significant full of meaning Again his face
was lifted before them as he rose to announce the text It was paler
now the eyes were glowing and luminous the long expressive fingers
were tremulous with excitement It was evident to all that no common
subject was to be introduced no common effort to be made Always
composed the audience grew more quiet still The very children felt
the hush of expectation and gazed wonderingly at the minister Even
that great man the Governor lost his air of unbending grandeur and
leaned expectantly forward
The subject was Pauls vision of the man in Macedonia crying for help
The speaker portrayed in burning words the condition of Macedonia the
heathen gloom and utter hopelessness of her people the vision that
came to Paul and his going to preach to them Then passing to
England under the Druids he described the dark paganism the
bloodstained altars the brutal priesthood of the age and told of
the cry that went forth for lighta cry that touched the heart of
the Roman Gregory into sending missionaries to show them the better
way
Like some royal poem was the discourse as it showed how through the
storms and perils of more than a thousand years amid the persecution
of popes the wars of barons and the tyranny of kings England had
kept the torch burning till in these latter times it had filled the
world with light Beautiful was the tribute he paid to the more recent
defenders of the faith and most intense the interest of the
listeners for men sat there who had come over the seas because of
their loyalty to the faithold and grizzled men whose youth had
known Cromwell and Charles Stuart and who had in more recent years
fought for King Monmouth and shared the dark fortunes of Argyle
The old Governor was roused like a veteran warhorse at the sound of
the trumpet many faces were flushed with martial ardor The young
minister paused reflectively at the enthusiasm he had kindled A
sorrowful smile flitted around his lips though the glow of
inspiration was still burning in his eyes Would they be as
enthusiastic when he made the application of his discourse
And yet England yea even New England was false disloyal She had
but half kept the faith When the cry of pagan England had gone forth
for light it had been heard the light had been given But now in her
day of illumination when the Macedonian cry came to her she closed
her ears and listened not On her skirts was the blood of the souls of
men and at the last day the wail of the heathen as they went down
into the gulf of flame would bear witness against her
Grave and impassioned with an undertone of warning and sorrow rang
the voice of the minister and the hearts of the people were shaken as
though a prophet were speaking
Out from the forests around us come the cry of heathen folk and ye
will not listen Ye have the light and they perish in darkness and go
down to the pit Generation after generation has grown up here in
forest and mountain and has lived and died without God and without
hope Generation has followed generation stumbling blindly downward
to the dust like the brutes that perish And now their children
bound in iron and sitting under the shadow of death reach out their
hands from the wilderness with a blind cry to you for help Will ye
hear
He lifted his hands to them as he spoke there was infinite pathos in
his voice for a moment it seemed as if all the wild people of the
wilderness were pleading through him for light Tears were in many
eyes yet in spite of the wonderful power of his oratory there were
faces that grew stern as he spokefor only a few years had passed
since the Pequod war and the feeling against the Indians was bitter
The Governor now sat erect and indignant
Strong and vehement was the ministers plea for missionaries to be
sent to the Indians fearlessly was the colonial government arraigned
for its deficiencies in this regard and the sands in the hourglass
were almost run out when the sermon was concluded and the minister
sank flushed and exhausted into his seat
The closing psalm was sung and the audience was dismissed Slow and
lingering were the words of the benediction as if the preacher were
conscious of defeat and longed to plead still further with his people
Then the gathering broke up the congregation filing out with the same
solemnity that had marked the entrance But when the open air was
reached the pentup excitement burst forth in a general murmur of
comment
A good man remarked the Governor to his staff but young quite
young And they smiled approvingly at the grim irony of the tone
Our pastor is a fine speaker said another but why will he bring
such unpleasant things into the pulpit A good doctrinal sermon now
would have strengthened our faith and edified us all
Ay a sermon on the errors of Episcopacy for instance
Such talk makes me angry growled a third Missionaries for the
Indians when the bones of the good folk they have killed are yet
bleaching amid the ashes of their cabins Missionaries for those red
demons an had it been powder and shot for them it had been a
righteous sermon
So the murmur of disapprobation went on among those slowly dispersing
groups who dreaded and hated the Indian with an intensity such as we
now can hardly realize And among them came the minister pale and
downcast realizing that he had dashed himself in vain against the
stern prejudice of his people and his age
CHAPTER II
THE MINISTERS HOME
Sore have I panted at the suns decline
To pass with him into the crimson West
And see the peoples of the evening
EDWIN ARNOLD
The Reverend Cecil Greyfor such was our young ministers
nameproceeded immediately after the service to his home Before we
cross its threshold with him let us pause for a moment to look back
over his past life
Born in New England he first received from his father who was a fine
scholar a careful home training and was then sent to England to
complete his education At Magdalen College Oxford he spent six
years Time passed very happily with him in the quiet cloisters of
that most beautiful of English colleges with its memories of Pole and
Rupert and the more courtly traditions of the state that Richard and
Edward had held there But when in 1687 James II attempted to
trample on the privileges of the Fellows and force upon them a popish
president Cecil was one of those who made the famous protest against
it and when protests availed nothing he left Oxford as also did a
number of others Returning to America he was appointed pastor of a
New England church becoming one of the many who carried the flower
of scholarship and eloquence into the bleak wilds of the New World
Restless sensitive ardent he was a man to whom a settled pastorate
was impossible Daring enterprises great undertakings of a religious
nature yet full of peril were the things for which he was naturally
fitted and amid the monotonous routine of parish duties he longed for
a greater activity Two centuries later he might have become
distinguished as a revivalist or as a champion of new and startling
views of theology earlier he might have been a reformer a follower
of Luther or Loyola as it was he was out of his sphere
But for a time the Reverend Mr Grey tried hard to mould himself to
his new work He went with anxious fidelity through all the labors of
the country pastorate He visited and prayed with the sick he read
the Bible to the old and dimsighted he tried to reconcile petty
quarrels he wrestled with his own discontent and strove hard to
grind down all the aspirations of his nature and shut out the larger
horizon of life
And for a time he was successful but during it he was induced to take
a very fatal step He was young handsome a clergyman and unmarried
Now a young unmarried minister is preeminently one of sorrows and
acquainted with grief For that large body of wellmeaning people who
are by nature incapacitated from attending to their own business take
him in hand without mercy Innumerable are the ways in which he is
informed that he ought to be married Subtle and past finding out are
the plots laid by all the old ladies and matchmakers of his church
to promote that desired event He is told that he can never succeed
in the ministry till he is married The praises of Matilda Jane
Tompkins or Lucinda Brown are sounded in his ears till he almost
wishes that both were in a better worlda world more worthy their
virtues At length wearily capitulating he marries some woodenfaced
or angular saint and is unhappy for life
Now there was in Mr Greys church a good gentle girl narrow but not
woodenfaced famous for her neatness and her housekeeping abilities
who was supposed to be the pattern for a ministers wife In time gone
by she had set her heart on a graceless sailor lad who was drowned at
sea much to the relief of her parents Ruth Anderson had mourned for
him quietly shutting up her sorrow in her own breast and going about
her work as before for hers was one of those subdued practical
natures that seek relief from trouble in hard work
She seemed in the judgment of all the old women in the church the
very one for Mr Grey and it likewise seemed that Mr Grey was the
very one for her So divers hints were dropped and divers things
were said until each began to wonder if marriage were not a duty The
Reverend Cecil Grey began to take unusual pains with his toilet and
wended his way up the hill to Mr Andersons with very much the aspect
of a man who is going to be hanged And his attempts at conversation
with the maiden were not at all what might have been expected from the
young minister whose graceful presence and fluent eloquence had been
the boast of Magdalen On her part the embarrassment was equally
great At length they were marrieda marriage based on a false idea
of duty on each side But no idea of duty however strong or however
false could blind the eyes of this married pair to the terrible fact
that not only love but mental sympathy was wanting Day by day Cecil
felt that his wife did not love him that her thoughts were not for
him that it was an effort for her to act the part of a wife toward
him Day by day she felt that his interests lay beyond her reach and
that all the tenderness in his manner toward her came from a sense of
duty not from love
But she strove in all ways to be a faithful wife and he tried hard to
be a kind and devoted husband He had been especially attentive to her
of late for her health had been failing and the old doctor had
shaken his head very gravely over her For a week or more she had
grown steadily worse and was now unable even to walk without help
Her malady was one of those that sap away the life with a swift and
deadly power against which all human skill seems unavailing
Mr Grey on returning from church entered the living room The invalid
sat at the window a heavy shawl wrapped about her her pale face
turned to the far blue line of sea visible through a gap in the
hills A pang wrenched his heart keenly at the sight Why would she
always sit at that window looking so sorrowfully so abstractedly at
the sea as if her heart was buried there with her dead lover
She started as she heard his footstep and turned her head quickly
toward him a faint flush tinging her cheek and a forced smile
quivering around her lips Her greeting was very gentle and he saw
that her heart was reproaching her for being so disloyal to him as to
think of her lost lover and yet he felt her fingers tremble and
shrink away from his as he took her hand
God forgive me he thought with infinite selfaccusation How
repugnant I must be to heran intruder thrusting myself into the
heart that is sacred to the dead
But he let her see nothing of this in his voice or manner as he
inquired how she had been She replied wearily that she was no better
that she longed to get well again and be at work
I missed your sermon today she said with that strained pathetic
smile upon her lips again You must tell me about it now
He drew his chair to her side and began to give an outline of the
sermon She listened but it was with forced attention without
sympathy without in the least entering into the spirit of what he was
saying It pained him He knew that her nature was so narrow so
conventional that it was impossible for her to comprehend his grand
scheme of Indian evangelization But he checked his impatience and
gave her a full synopsis of the discourse
It is useless useless They cannot understand A whole race is
perishing around them and they will not put forth a hand save to
mistreat a Quaker or throw a stone at a Churchman Our Puritanism is
like iron to resist tyrannybut alas it is like iron too when one
tries to bend it to some generous undertaking
He stopped checking back other and more bitter words All his soul
rose up in revolt against the prejudice by which he was surrounded
Then Ruth spoke timidly
Seeing that it is so would it not be best to let this missionary
subject go and preach on practical everyday matters I am not wise
in these things I know but would it not be better to preach on
common subjects showing us how we ought to live from day to day than
to discourse of those larger things that the people do not
understand
His face darkened though not angrily This was the same prejudice he
had just encountered in the meetinghouse though in a different form
He arose and paced back and forth with quick impatient steps Then he
came and stood before her with folded arms and resolute face
