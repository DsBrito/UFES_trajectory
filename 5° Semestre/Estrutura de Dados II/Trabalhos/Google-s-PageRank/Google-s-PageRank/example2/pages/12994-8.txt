SYDNEY SMITH
CHAPTER I
EDUCATIONSALISBURY PLAINEDINBURGH
A worthy tradesman who had accumulated a large fortune married a lady of
gentle birth and manners In later years one of his daughters said to a
friend of the family I dare say you notice a great difference between
papas behaviour and mammas It is easily accounted for Papa immensely
to his credit raised himself to his present position from the shop but
mamma was extremely well born She was a Miss Smithone of the old
Smiths of Essex
It might appear that Sydney Smith was a growth of the same majestic but
mysterious tree for he was born at Woodford but further research traces
his ancestry to Devonshire We are all one family he used to say all
the Smiths who dwell on the face of the earth You may try to disguise it
in any way you likeSmyth or Smythe or Smijth1but you always get
back to Smith after allthe most numerous and most respectable family in
England When a compiler of pedigrees asked permission to insert Sydneys
arms in a County History he replied I regret sir not to be able to
contribute to so valuable a work but the Smiths never had any arms They
invariably sealed their letters with their thumbs In later life he
adopted the excellent and characteristic mottoFaber me fortun and
to some impertinent questions about his grandfather he replied with
becoming gravityHe disappeared about the time of the assizes and we
asked no questions
As a matter of fact this maligned progenitor came to London from
Devonshire established a business in Eastcheap and left it to his two
sons Robert and James Robert Smith2 made over his share to his brother
and went forth to see the world This object he pursued amid great
vicissitudes of fortune and environment till in old age he settled down at
Bishops Lydeard in Somerset He married Maria Olier a pretty girl of
French descent and by her had five children Robert Percybetter known as
Bobusborn in 1770 Sydney in 1771 Cecil in 1772 Courtenay in 1773
and Maria in 1774
Sydney Smith was born on the 3rd of June and was baptized on the 1st of
July in the parish church of Woodford His infancy was passed at South
Stoneham near Southampton At the age of six he was sent to a private
school at Southampton and on the 19th of July 1782 was elected a Scholar
of Winchester College He stayed at Winchester for six years and worked
his way to the top place in the school being Prefect of Hall when he
left in 1788 Beyond these facts Winchester seems to retain no impressions
of her brilliant son in this respect contrasting strangely with other
Public Schools Westminster knows all about Cowperand a sorry tale it is
Canning left an ineffaceable mark on Eton Harrow abounds in traditions
oral and written of Sheridan and Byron Peel and Palmerston But
Winchester is silent about Sydney Smith
Sydney however was not silent about Winchester In one of the liveliest
passages of his controversial writings he said
I was at school and college with the Archbishop of Canterbury3
fiftythree years ago he knocked me down with the chessboard for
checkmating himand now he is attempting to take away my patronage I
believe these are the only two acts of violence he ever committed in
his life
Now Howley was a prefect when Sydney was a junior and this game of chess
must have been as a living Wykehamist has pointed out to me a command
performance The big boy liked chess so the little boy had to play it
the big boy disliked being checkmated so the little boy was knocked down
This and similar experiences probably coloured Sydneys mind when he wrote
in 1810
At a Public School for such is the system established by immemorial
custom every boy is alternately tyrant and slave The power which the
elder part of these communities exercises over the younger is
exceedingly great very difficult to be controlled and accompanied
not unfrequently with cruelty and caprice It is the common law of
these places that the younger should be implicitly obedient to the
elder boys and this obedience resembles more the submission of a
slave to his master or of a sailor to his captain than the common
and natural deference which would always be shown by one boy to
another a few years older than himself Now this system we cannot
help considering as an evil because it inflicts upon boys for two or
three years of their lives many painful hardships and much
unpleasant servitude These sufferings might perhaps be of some use in
military schools but to give to a boy the habit of enduring
privations to which he will never again be called upon to submitto
inure him to pains which he will never again feeland to subject him
to the privation of comforts with which he will always in future
aboundis surely not a very useful and valuable severity in
education It is not the life in miniature which he is to lead
hereafter nor does it bear any relation to it he will never again be
subjected to so much insolence and caprice nor ever in all human
probability called upon to make so many sacrifices The servile
obedience which it teaches might be useful to a menial domestic or
the habit of enterprise which it encourages prove of importance to a
military partisan but we cannot see what bearing it has upon the
calm regular civil life which the sons of gentlemen destined to
opulent idleness or to any of the more learned professions are
destined to lead Such a system makes many boys very miserable and
produces those bad effects upon the temper and disposition which
boyish suffering always does produce But what good it does we are
much at a loss to conceive Reasonable obedience is extremely useful
in forming the disposition Submission to tyranny lays the foundation
of hatred suspicion cunning and a variety of odious passions
The wretchedness of school tyranny is trifling enough to a man who
only contemplates it in ease of body and tranquillity of mind
through the medium of twenty intervening years but it is quite as
real and quite as acute while it lasts as any of the sufferings of
mature life and the utility of these sufferings or the price paid in
compensation for them should be clearly made out to a conscientious
parent before he consents to expose his children to them
Lady Holland tells us that in old age her father used to shudder at the
recollections of Winchester and represented the system prevailing there
in his youth as composed of abuse neglect and vice And speaking of
the experience of lower boys at Public Schools in general he described it
as an intense system of tyranny of which the English are very fond and
think it fits a boy for the world but the world bad as it is has nothing
half so bad
A man gets well pummelled at a Public School is subject to every
misery and every indignity which seventeen years of age can inflict
upon nine and ten has his eye nearly knocked out and his clothes
stolen and cut to pieces and twenty years afterwards when he is a
chrysalis and has forgotten the miseries of his grub state is
determined to act a manly part in life and says I passed through
all that myself and I am determined my son shall pass through it as I
have done and away goes his bleating progeny to the tyranny and
servitude of the Long Chamber or the Large Dormitory It would surely
be much more rational to say Because I have passed through it I am
determined my son shall not pass through it Because I was kicked for
nothing and cuffed for nothing and fagged for everything I will
spare all these miseries to my child
And while he thus condemned the discipline under which he had been reared
he had no better opinion of the instruction Not that he was an opponent of
classical education on the contrary he had a genuine and reasoned
admiration for the two ancient languages He held that compared to them
merely as vehicles of thought and passion all modern languages are dull
illcontrived and barbarous He thought that even the most accomplished
of modern writers might still be glad to borrow descriptive power from
Tacitus dignified perspicuity from Livy simplicity from Caesar and from
Homer some portion of that light and heat which dispersed into ten
thousand channels has filled the world with bright images and illustrious
thoughts Let the cultivator of modern literature addict himself to the
purest models of taste which France Italy and England could supplyhe
might still learn from Virgil to be majestic and from Tibullus to be
tender he might not yet look upon the face of nature as Theocritus saw it
nor might he reach those springs of pathos with which Euripides softened
the hearts of his audience
This sound appreciation of what was best in classical literature was
accompanied in Sydney Smith by the most outspoken contempt for the way in
which Greek and Latin are taught in Public Schools He thought that
schoolmasters encouraged their pupils to love the instrument better than
the endnot the luxury which the difficulty encloses but the
difficultynot the filbert but the shellnot what may be read in Greek
but Greek itself
We think that in order to secure an attention to Homer and Virgil we
must catch up every man whether he is to be a clergyman or a duke
begin with him at six years of age and never quit him till he is
twenty making him conjugate and decline for life and death and so
teaching him to estimate his progress in real wisdom as he can scan
the verses of the Greek Tragedians
He desired that boys should obtain a quick and easy mastery over the
authors whom they had to read and on this account he urged that they
should be taught by the use of literal and interlinear translations but a
literal translation or any translation of a schoolbook is a contraband
article in English schools which a schoolmaster would instantly seize as
a customhouse officer would seize a barrel of gin
Grammar gerundgrinding the tyranny of the Lexicon and the Dictionary
had got the schoolboys of England in their grasp and the boy was
suffocated with the nonsense of grammarians overwhelmed with every species
of difficulty disproportionate to his age and driven by despair to pegtop
or marbles while the British Parent stood and spoke thus with himself
Have I read through Lilly Have I learnt by heart that most atrocious
monument of absurdity the Westminster Grammar Have I been whipt for
the substantives whipt for the verbs and whipt for and with the
interjections Have I picked the sense slowly and word by word out
of Hederich and shall my son be exempt from all this misery Ay
ay its all mighty well but I went through this myself and I am
determined my children shall do the same
Another grotesque abuse with regard to which Sydney Smith was a reformer
fifty years before his time was compulsory versification
There are few boys who remain to the age of eighteen or nineteen at a
Public School without making above ten thousand Latin versesa
greater number than is contained in the Aeneid and after he
has made this quantity of verses in a dead language unless the poet
should happen to be a very weak man indeed he never makes another as
long as he lives4
The English clergy in whose hands education entirely rests bring up
the first young men of the country as if they were all to keep
grammarschools in little countrytowns and a nobleman upon whose
knowledge and liberality the honour and welfare of his country may
depend is diligently worried for half his life with the small
pedantry of longs and shorts
The same process is applied at the other end of the social scale The
bakers son young Crumpet is sent to a grammarschool takes to his
books spends the best years of his life as all eminent Englishmen do in
making Latin verses learns that the Crum in Crumpet is long and the
pet short goes to the University gets a prize for an essay on the
Dispersion of the Jews takes Orders becomes a Bishops chaplain has a
young nobleman for his pupil publishes a useless classic and a Serious
Call to the Unconverted and then goes through the Elysian transitions of
Prebendary Dean Prelate and the long train of purple profit and
power
In this vivacious passage Sydney Smith caricatures his own career which
though it neither began in a bakers shop nor ended in an episcopal palace
followed pretty closely the line of development here indicated At
Winchester he took to his books with such goodwill that in spite of all
hindrances he became an excellent scholar and laid the strong foundations
for a wide and generous culture His family indeed propagated some pleasing
traditions about his schooldaysone of a benevolent stranger who found him
reading Virgil when other boys were playing cricket patted his head and
foretold his future greatness another of a roundrobin from his
schoolfellows declining to compete against him for prizes because he
always gained them But this is not history
From Winchester Sydney Smith passed in natural course to the other of the
two colleges of St Mary Winton and in the interval between Winchester
and Oxford his father sent him for six months to Normandy with a view to
improving his French Revolution was in the air and it was thought a
salutary precaution that he should join one of the Jacobin clubs in the
town where he boarded and he was duly entered as Le Citoyen Smit Membre
Affilie au Club des Jacobins de Mont Villiers
But he was soon recalled to more tranquil scenes He was elected Scholar of
New College Oxford on the 5th of January 1789 and at the end of his
second year he exchanged his Scholarship for a Fellowship From that time
on he never cost his father a farthing and he paid a considerable debt for
his younger brother Courtenay though as he justly remarks a hundred
pounds a year was very difficult to spread over the wants of a College
life Ten years later he wroteI got in debt by buying books I never
borrowed a farthing of anybody and never received much and have lived in
poverty and economy all my life
His career at Oxford is buried in even deeper obscurity than his schooltime
at Winchester This is no doubt to be explained on the intellectual side
by the fact that members of New College were at that time exempt from
public examination and on the social side by the straitened
circumstances which prevented him from showing hospitality and the pride
which made him unwilling to accept what he could not return We are left to
gather his feelings about Oxford and the system pursued there from casual
references in his critical writings and these are uncomplimentary enough
When he wishes to stigmatize a proposition as enormously and preposterously
absurd he says that there is no authority on earth always excepting the
Dean of Christ Church which could make it credible to me When stirred
to the liveliest indignation by the iniquities which a Tory Government is
practising in Ireland he exclaimsA Senior Proctor of the University of
Oxford the Head of a House or the examining chaplain to a Bishop may
believe these things can last but every man of the world whose
understanding has been exercised in the business of life must see and see
with a breaking heart that they will soon come to a fearful termination
He praised a comparison of the Universities to enormous hulks confined
with mooringchains everything flowing and progressing around them while
they themselves stood still
When pleading for a wider and more reasonable course of studies at Oxford
he says
A genuine Oxford tutor would shudder to hear his young men disputing
upon moral and political truth forming and putting down theories and
indulging in all the boldness of youthful discussion He would augur
nothing from it but impiety to God and treason to Kings
Protesting against the undue predominance of classical studies in the
Universities as at the Public Schools he says
Classical literature is the great object at Oxford Many minds so
employed have produced many works and much fame in that department
but if all liberal arts and sciences useful to human life had been
taught there if some had dedicated themselves to chemistry some to
mathematics some to experimental philosophy and if every attainment
had been honoured in the mixt ratio of its difficulty and utility the
system of such an University would have been much more valuable but
the splendour of its name something less
The hopelessness of any attempt to reform the curriculum of Oxford by
opening the door to Political Economy is stated with characteristic
vigour
When an University has been doing useless things for a long time it
appears at first degrading to them to be useful A set of lectures upon
Political Economy would be discouraged in Oxford possibly despised
probably not permitted To discuss the Enclosure of Commons and to
dwell upon imports and exportsto come so near to common life would
seem to be undignified and contemptible In the same manner the Parr
or the Bentley of his day would be scandalised to be put on a level
with the discoverer of a neutral salt and yet what other measure is
there of dignity in intellectual labour but usefulness and
difficulty And what ought the term University to mean but a
place where every science is taught which is liberal and at the same
time useful to mankind Nothing would so much tend to bring classical
literature within proper bounds as a steady and invariable appeal to
these tests in our appreciation of all human knowledge The puffedup
pedant would collapse into his proper size and the maker of verses
and the rememberer of words would soon assume that station which is
the lot of those who go up unbidden to the upper places of the feast
In 1810 he wrote with reference to the newlyinvented Examination for
Honours at Oxford
If Oxford is become at last sensible of the miserable state to which
it was reduced as everybody else was out of Oxford and if it is
making serious efforts to recover from the degradation into which it
was plunged a few years past the good wishes of every respectable man
must go with it
And again
On the new plan of Oxford education we shall offer no remarks It has
many defects but it is very honourable to the University to have made
such an experiment The improvement upon the old plan is certainly
very great and we most sincerely and honestly wish to it every
species of success
His opinions on the subject of the Universities did not mellow with age As
late as 1831 he wrote of a friend who had just sent his son to Cambridge
He has put him there to spend his money to lose what good qualities
he has and to gain nothing useful in return If men had made no more
progress in the common arts of life than they have in education we
should at this moment be dividing our food with our fingers and
drinking out of the palms of our hands
It was just as bad when a lady sent her son to his own University
I feel for her about her son at Oxford knowing as I do that the
only consequences of a University education are the growth of vice and
the waste of money
In 1792 Sydney Smith took his degree5 and now the question of a
profession had to be faced and decided It was necessary that he should
begin to make money at once for the pecuniary resources of the family
narrow at the beat were now severely taxed by his mothers failing health
and by the cost of starting his brothers in the world At Oxford he had
dabbled in medicine and anatomy and had attended the lectures of Dr
afterwards Sir Christopher Pegge6 who recommended him to become a
doctor His father wished to send him as a supercargo to China His own
strong preference was for the Bar but his father who had already brought
up one son to that profession and found it more expensive than profitable
looked very unfavourably on the design and under paternal pressure the
wittiest Englishman of his generation determined to seek Holy Orders or
to use his own oldfashioned phrase to enter the Church He assumed the
sacred character without enthusiasm and looked back on its adoption with
regret The law he said in after life is decidedly the best profession
for a young man if he has anything in him In the Church a man is thrown
into life with his hands tied and bid to swim he does well if he keeps
his head above water
Under these rather dismal auspices Sydney Smith was ordained Deacon in
1794 He might one would suppose have been ordained on his Fellowship
and have continued to reside in College with a view to obtaining a
Lectureship or some other office of profit Perhaps he found the mental
atmosphere of Oxford insalubrious Perhaps he was unpopular in College
Perhaps his political opinions were already too liberal for the place
Certain it is that his visit to France in the earlier stages of the
Revolution had led him to extol the French for teaching mankind the use
of their power their reason and their rights Whatever was the cause he
turned his back on Oxford and as soon as he was ordained became Curate
of Netheravon a village near Amesbury7 As he himself said the name of
Curate had lost its legal meaning and instead of denoting the incumbent
of a living came to signify the deputy of an absentee He had sole charge
of the parish of Netheravon and was also expected to perform one service
every Sunday at the adjoining village of Fittleton Nothing wrote the
newfledged Curate can equal the profound the immeasurable the awful
dulness of this place in the which I lie dead and buried in hope of a
joyful resurrection in 1796 Indeed it is not easy to conceive a more
dismal situation for a young ardent and active man fresh from Oxford
full of intellectual ambition and not very keenly alive to the spiritual
opportunities of his calling The village a kind of oasis in the desert of
Salisbury Plain was not touched by any of the coachingroads The only
method of communication with the outside world was by the marketcart which
brought the necessaries of life from Salisbury once a week The vicar was
nonresident and the squire Mr HicksBeach was only an occasional
visitor for his principal residence was fifty miles off at Williamstrip
near Fairford He had acquired Netheravon by his marriage with Miss
Beach The church was empty and the curate in charge likened his
preaching to the voice of one crying in the wilderness The condition of
the village may best be judged from a report made to Mr HicksBeach by his
steward in 1793 Nearly every one was dependent on parochial relief Not a
man earned ten shillings a week A man with a wife and four children worked
for six shillings a week A girl earned by spinning four shillings a
month Idleness disease and immorality were rife and as an incentive to
profitable industry a young farmer beat a sickly labourer within an inch
of his life
Mrs HicksBeach referred this uncomfortable report on the condition of her
property to the newlyinstalled curate requesting his opinion on the cases
specified The curate replied with characteristic vigour One family owed
its wretched condition to mismanagement and extravagance another to
ignorance bordering on brutality another to Irish extraction numbers
disease and habits of idleness One family was composed of weak witless
people totally wretched without sense to extricate them from their
wretchedness a second was perfectly wretched and helpless and a third
was aliment for Newgate food for the haltera ragged wretched savage
stubborn race8
The squire and Mrs HicksBeach who seem to have been thoroughly
highprincipled and intelligent people were much concerned to find the
curate corroborating and even expanding the evil reports of the steward
They immediately began considering remedies and decided that their first
reform should be to establish a Sundayschool The institution so named
bore little resemblance to the Sundayschools of the present day but
followed a plan which Robert Raikes9 and Mrs Hannah More10 had
originated and which Bishop Shute Barrington11 who was translated to
Durham in 1791 had strongly urged on the Diocese of Sarum12 Boys and
girls were taught together The master and mistress were paid the modest
salary of two shillings a Sunday The children were taught spelling and
reading and as soon as they had mastered those arts were made to read
the Bible the Prayer Book and Mrs Mores tracts The children attended
church sitting together in a big pew and in hot weather had their
lessons in the church before and after the service As soon as the
Sundayschool had proved itself popular and successful an Industrial
School was arranged for three nights in the week so that the girls of the
village might be taught domestic arts Both institutions prospered and
ninety years later Mr Stuart Reid visiting the cottages of Netheravon in
order to collect material for his book caught the lingering tradition that
Sydney Smith was fond of children and young people and took pains to
teach them
This tradition bears out what Sydney Smith said in his Farewell Sermon to
the people of Netheravon Preaching from Proverbs iv 13 Take fast hold
of instruction he said
The Sundayschool which with some trouble and expense has been
brought to the state in which you see it will afford to the poorest
people an opportunity of giving to their children some share of
education and I will not suppose that anybody can be so indolent and
so unprincipled as not to exact from their children a regular
attendance upon it I sincerely exhort you and beg of you now for
the last time that after this institution has been got into some kind
of order you will not suffer it to fall to ruin by your own
negligence I have lived among your children and have taught them
myself and have seen them improve and I know it will make them
better and happier men
And now a change was at hand The curate of Netheravon had never intended
to stay there longer than he was obliged and the happy resurrection for
which he had hoped came in an unexpected fashion Here is his own account
of his translation written in 1839
The squire of the parish took a fancy to me and requested me to go
with his son to reside at the University of Weimar before we could
get there Germany became the seat of war and in stress of politics
we put into Edinburgh where I remained five years The principles of
the French Revolution were then fully afloat and it is impossible to
conceive a more violent and agitated state of society
Sydney Smith and his pupil Michael Beach13 arrived at Edinburgh in June
1798 They lodged successively at 38 South Hanover Street 19 Ann Street
and 46 George Street The University of Edinburgh was then in its days of
glory Dugald Stewart was Professor of Moral Philosophy John Playfair of
Mathematics John Hill of Humanity The teaching was at once interesting
and systematic the intellectual atmosphere liberal and enterprising
English parents who cared seriously for mental and moral freedom such as
the Duke of Somerset the Duke of Bedford and Lord Lansdowne sent their
sons to Edinburgh instead of Oxford or Cambridge The University was in
close relations with the Bar then adorned by the great names of Francis
Jeffrey Francis Homer Henry Brougham and Walter Scott While Michael
Beach was duly attending the professorial lectures his tutor was not idle
From Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown he acquired the elements of Moral
Philosophy He gratified a lifelong fancy by attending the Clinical
Lectures given by Dr Gregory14 in the hospitals of Edinburgh and
studied Chemistry under Dr Black15 He amused himself with chemical
experiments
I mixd 4 of Holland gin with 8 of olive oil and stirrd them well
together I then added 4 of nitric acid A violent ebullition ensued
Nitrous oether as I supposd was generated and in about four hours
the oil became perfectly concrete white and hard as tallow
To these scientific pastimes were soon added some more professional
activities The Episcopalians of Edinburgh at this time worshipped in
Charlotte Chapel Rose Street which was sold in 1818 to the Baptists The
incumbent was the Rev Archibald Alison16 who wrote a treatise on
Taste and ministered in one of the ugliest buildings in the world The
arrival in Edinburgh of a clever young man in English Orders was an
opportunity not to be neglected and Sydney Smith was often invited to
preach in Charlotte Chapel Writing to Mr HicksBeach he says
I have the pleasure of seeing my audience nod approbation while they
sleep
And again
The people of Edinburgh gape at my sermons In the middle of an
exquisite address to Virtue beginning O Virtue I saw a rascal
gaping as if his jaws were torn asunder
But this though perhaps it may have perplexed the worthy squire to whom it
was addressed is mere selfbanter Sydneys preaching attracted some of
the keenest minds in Edinburgh It was fresh practical pungent and
though rich in a vigorous and resounding eloquence was poles asunder from
the rhetoric of which O Virtue is a typical instance
So popular were these sermons at Charlotte Chapel that in 1800 the preacher
ventured to publish a small volume of them which was soon followed by a
second and enlarged edition This book of sermons is dedicated to Lord Webb
Seymour17because I know no man who in spite of the disadvantages of
high birth lives to more honourable and commendable purposes than
yourself
The preface to the book is a vigorous plea for greater animation in
preaching a wider variety of topics and a more direct bearing on
practical life than were then usual in the pulpits of the Church of
England
Is it wonder he asks that every semidelirious sectary who pours
forth his animated nonsense with the genuine look and voice of
passion should gesticulate away the congregation of the most profound
and learned divine of the Established Church and in two Sundays
preach him bare to the very sexton Why are we natural everywhere but
in the pulpit No man expresses warm and animated feelings anywhere
else with his mouth alone but with his whole body he articulates
with every limb and talks from head to foot with a thousand voices
Why this holoplexia on sacred occasions alone Why call in the aid of
paralysis to piety Is it a rule of oratory to balance the style
against the subject and to handle the most sublime truths in the
dullest language and the driest manner Is sin to be taken from men
as Eve was from Adam by casting them into a deep slumber Or from
what possible perversion of common sense are we to look like
fieldpreachers in Zembla holy lumps of ice numbed into quiescence
and stagnation and mumbling
The subjects with which these sermons deal are practical in the highest
degree such as The Love of Country The Poor Magdalen The Causes of
Republican Opinions The Effect of Christianity on Manners and The
Treatment of Servants One or two short samples of his thought and style
will not be out of place
This is from his sermon on the Magdalen
The best mediation with God Almighty the Father and His Son of Mercy
and Love is the prayer of a human being whom you have saved from
perdition
This is from the sermon on Christianity and Manners
If ye would that men should love you love ye also them not with
