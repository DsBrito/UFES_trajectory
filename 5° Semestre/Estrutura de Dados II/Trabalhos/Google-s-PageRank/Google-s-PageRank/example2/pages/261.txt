Before the Altar
Before the Altar bowed he stands
With empty hands
Upon it perfumed offerings burn
Wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn
Not one of all these has he given
No flame of his has leapt to Heaven
Firesouled vermilionhearted
Forked and darted
Consuming what a few spare pence
Have cheaply bought to fling from hence
In idlyasked petition
His sole condition
Love and poverty
And while the moon
Swings slow across the sky
Athwart a waving pine tree
And soon
Tips all the needles there
With silver sparkles bitterly
He gazes while his soul
Grows hard with thinking of the poorness of his dole
Shining and distant Goddess hear my prayer
Where you swim in the high air
With charity look down on me
Under this tree
Tending the gifts I have not brought
The rare and goodly things
I have not sought
Instead take from me all my life
Upon the wings
Of shimmering moonbeams
I pack my poets dreams
For you
My wearying strife
My courage my loss
Into the night I toss
For you
Golden Divinity
Deign to look down on me
Who so unworthily
Offers to you
All life has known
Seeds withered unsown
Hopes turning quick to fears
Laughter which dies in tears
The shredded remnant of a man
Is all the span
And compass of my offering to you
Empty and silent I
Kneel before your pure calm majesty
On this stone in this urn
I pour my heart and watch it burn
Myself the sacrifice but be
Still unmoved  Divinity
From the altar bathed in moonlight
The smoke rose straight in the quiet night
Suggested by the Cover of a Volume of Keatss Poems
Wild little bird who chose thee for a sign
To put upon the cover of this book
Who heard thee singing in the distance dim
The vague far greenness of the enshrouding wood
When the damp freshness of the morning earth
Was full of pungent sweetness and thy song
Who followed over moss and twisted roots
And pushed through the wet leaves of trailing vines
Where slanting sunbeams gleamed uncertainly
While ever clearer came the dropping notes
Until at last two widening trunks disclosed
Thee singing on a spray of branching beech
Hidden then seen and always that same song
Of joyful sweetness rapture incarnate
Filled the hushed rustling stillness of the wood
We do not know what bird thou art  Perhaps
That fairy bird fabled in island tale
Who never sings but once and then his song
Is of such fearful beauty that he dies
From sheer exuberance of melody
For this they took thee little bird for this
They captured thee tilting among the leaves
And stamped thee for a symbol on this book
For it contains a song surpassing thine
Richer more sweet more poignant  And the poet
Who felt this burning beauty and whose heart
Was full of loveliest things sang all he knew
A little while and then he died too frail
To bear this untamed passionate burst of song
Apples of Hesperides
Glinting golden through the trees
Apples of Hesperides
Through the moonpierced warp of night
Shoot pale shafts of yellow light
Swaying to the kissing breeze
Swings the treasure goldengleaming
Apples of Hesperides
Far and lofty yet they glimmer
Apples of Hesperides
Blinded by their radiant shimmer
Pushing forward just for these
Dewbesprinkled bramblemarred
Poor duped mortal travelscarred
Always thinking soon to seize
And possess the goldenglistening
Apples of Hesperides
Orbed and glittering and pendent
Apples of Hesperides
Not one missing still transcendent
Clustering like a swarm of bees
Yielding to no mans desire
Glowing with a saffron fire
Splendid unassailed the golden
Apples of Hesperides
Azure and Gold
April had covered the hills
With flickering yellows and reds
The sparkle and coolness of snow
Was blown from the mountain beds
Across a deepsunken stream
The pink of blossoming trees
And from windless appleblooms
The humming of many bees
The air was of rose and gold
Arabesqued with the song of birds
Who swinging unseen under leaves
Made music more eager than words
Of a sudden aslant the road
A brightness to dazzle and stun
A glint of the bluest blue
A flash from a sapphire sun
Bluebirds so blue t was a dream
An impossible unconceived hue
The high sky of summer dropped down
Some rapturous ocean to woo
Such a colour such infinite light
The heart of a fabulous gem
Manyfaceted brilliant and rare
Centre Stone of the earths diadem
Centre Stone of the Crown of the World
Sincerity graved on your youth
And your eyes hold the bluebird flash
The sapphire shaft which is truth
Petals
Life is a stream
On which we strew
Petal by petal the flower of our heart
The end lost in dream
They float past our view
We only watch their glad early start
Freighted with hope
Crimsoned with joy
We scatter the leaves of our opening rose
Their widening scope
Their distant employ
We never shall know  And the stream as it flows
Sweeps them away
Each one is gone
Ever beyond into infinite ways
We alone stay
While years hurry on
The flower fared forth though its fragrance still stays
Venetian Glass
As one who sails upon a wide blue sea
Far out of sight of land his mind intent
Upon the sailing of his little boat
On tightening ropes and shaping fair his course
Hears suddenly across the restless sea
The rhythmic striking of some towered clock
And wakes from thoughtless idleness to time
Time the slow pulse which beats eternity
So through the vacancy of busy life
At intervals you cross my path and bring
The deep solemnity of passing years
For you I have shed bitter tears for you
I have relinquished that for which my heart
Cried out in selfish longing  And tonight
Having just left you I can say  T is well
Thank God that I have known a soul so true
So nobly just so worthy to be loved
Fatigue
Stupefy my heart to every days monotony
Seal up my eyes I would not look so far
Chasten my steps to peaceful regularity
Bow down my head lest I behold a star
Fill my days with work a thousand calm necessities
Leaving no moment to consecrate to hope
Girdle my thoughts within the dull circumferences
Of facts which form the actual in one short hours scope
Give me dreamless sleep and loose nights power over me
Shut my ears to sounds only tumultuous then
Bid Fancy slumber and steal away its potency
Or Nature wakes and strives to live again
Let each day pass well ordered in its usefulness
Unlit by sunshine unscarred by storm
Dower me with strength and curb all foolish eagerness
The law exacts obedience  Instruct I will conform
A Japanese WoodCarving
High up above the open welcoming door
It hangs a piece of wood with colours dim
Once long ago it was a waving tree
And knew the sun and shadow through the leaves
Of forest trees in a thick eastern wood
The winter snows had bent its branches down
The spring had swelled its buds with coming flowers
Summer had run like fire through its veins
While autumn pelted it with chestnut burrs
And strewed the leafy ground with acorn cups
Dark midnight storms had roared and crashed among
Its branches breaking here and there a limb
But every now and then broad sunlit days
Lovingly lingered caught among the leaves
Yes it had known all this and yet to us
It does not speak of mossy forest ways
Of whispering pine trees or the shimmering birch
But of quick winds and the salt stinging sea
An artist once with patient careful knife
Had fashioned it like to the untamed sea
Here waves uprear themselves their tops blown back
By the gay sunny wind which whips the blue
And breaks it into gleams and sparks of light
Among the flashing waves are two white birds
Which swoop and soar and scream for very joy
At the wild sport  Now diving quickly in
Questing some glistening fish  Now flying up
Their dripping feathers shining in the sun
While the wet drops like little glints of light
Fall pattering backward to the parent sea
Gliding along the green and foamflecked hollows
Or skimming some white crest about to break
The spirits of the sky deigning to stoop
And play with ocean in a summer mood
Hanging above the high wide open door
It brings to us in quiet firelit room
The freedom of the earths vast solitudes
Where heaping sunny waves tumble and roll
And seabirds scream in wanton happiness
A Little Song
When you my Dear are away away
How wearily goes the creeping day
A year drags after morning and night
Starts another year of candle light
O Pausing Sun and Lingering Moon
Grant me I beg of you this boon
Whirl round the earth as never sun
Has his diurnal journey run
And Moon slip past the ladders of air
In a single flash while your streaming hair
Catches the stars and pulls them down
To shine on some slumbering Chinese town
O Kindly Sun  Understanding Moon
Bring evening to crowd the footsteps of noon
But when that long awaited day
Hangs ripe in the heavens your voyaging stay
Be morning O Sun with the lark in song
Be afternoon for ages long
And Moon let you and your lesser lights
Watch over a century of nights
Behind a Wall
I own a solace shut within my heart
A garden full of many a quaint delight
And warm with drowsy poppied sunshine bright
Flaming with lilies out of whose cups dart
Shining things
With powdered wings
Here terrace sinks to terrace arbors close
The ends of dreaming paths a wanton wind
Jostles the halfripe pears and then unkind
Tumbles aslumber in a pillar rose
With content
Grown indolent
By night my garden is oerhung with gems
Fixed in an onyx setting  Fireflies
Flicker their lanterns in my dazzled eyes
In serried rows I guess the straight stiff stems
Of hollyhocks
Against the rocks
So far and still it is that listening
I hear the flowers talking in the dawn
And where a sunken basin cuts the lawn
Cinctured with iris pale and glistening
The sudden swish
Of a waking fish
A Winter Ride
Who shall declare the joy of the running
Who shall tell of the pleasures of flight
Springing and spurning the tufts of wild heather
Sweeping widewinged through the blue dome of light
Everything mortal has moments immortal
Swift and Godgifted immeasurably bright
So with the stretch of the white road before me
Shining snowcrystals rainbowed by the sun
Fields that are white stained with long cool blue shadows
Strong with the strength of my horse as we run
Joy in the touch of the wind and the sunlight
Joy  With the vigorous earth I am one
A Coloured Print by Shokei
It winds along the face of a cliff
This path which I long to explore
And over it dashes a waterfall
And the air is full of the roar
And the thunderous voice of waters which sweep
In a silver torrent over some steep
It clears the path with a mighty bound
And tumbles below and away
And the trees and the bushes which grow in the rocks
Are wet with its jewelled spray
The air is misty and heavy with sound
And small wet wildflowers star the ground
Oh  The dampness is very good to smell
And the path is soft to tread
And beyond the fall it winds up and on
While little streamlets thread
Their own meandering way down the hill
Each singing its own little song until
I forget that t is only a pictured path
And I hear the water and wind
And look through the mist and strain my eyes
To see what there is behind
For it must lead to a happy land
This little path by a waterfall spanned
Song
Oh  To be a flower
Nodding in the sun
Bending then upspringing
As the breezes run
Holding up
A scentbrimmed cup
Full of summers fragrance to the summer sun
Oh  To be a butterfly
Still upon a flower
Winking with its painted wings
Happy in the hour
Blossoms hold
Mines of gold
Deep within the farthest heart of each chaliced flower
Oh  To be a cloud
Blowing through the blue
Shadowing the mountains
Rushing loudly through
Valleys deep
Where torrents keep
Always their plunging thunder and their misty arch of blue
Oh  To be a wave
Splintering on the sand
Drawing back but leaving
Lingeringly the land
Rainbow light
Flashes bright
Telling tales of coral caves half hid in yellow sand
Soon they die the flowers
Insects live a day
Clouds dissolve in showers
Only waves at play
Last forever
Shall endeavor
Make a sea of purpose mightier than we dream today
The Fool Errant
The Fool Errant sat by the highway of life
And his gaze wandered up and his gaze wandered down
A vigorous youth but with no wish to walk
Yet his longing was great for the distant town
He whistled a little frivolous tune
Which he felt to be pulsing with ecstasy
For he thought that success always followed desire
Such a very superlative fool was he
A maiden came by on an ambling mule
Her gown was rosered and her kerchief blue
On her lap she carried a basket of eggs
Thought the fool There is certainly room for two
So he jauntily swaggered towards the maid
And put out his hand to the bridlerein
My pretty girl quoth the fool take me up
For to ride with you to the town I am fain
But the maiden struck at his upraised arm
And pelted him hotly with eggs a score
The mule lashed into a fury ran
The fool went back to his stone and swore
Then out of the cloud of settling dust
The burly form of an abbot appeared
Reading his office he rode to the town
And the fool got up for his heart was cheered
He stood in the midst of the long white road
And swept off his cap till it touched the ground
Ah Reverent Sir well met said the fool
A worthier transport never was found
I pray you allow me to mount with you
Your palfrey seems both sturdy and young
The abbot looked up from the holy book
And cried out in anger Hold your tongue
How dare you obstruct the Kings highroad
You saucy varlet get out of my way
Then he gave the fool a cut with his whip
And leaving him smarting he rode away
The fool was angry the fool was sore
And he cursed the folly of monks and maids
If I could but meet with a man sighed the fool
For a woman fears and a friar upbraids
Then he saw a flashing of distant steel
And the clanking of harness greeted his ears
And up the road journeyed knightsatarms
With waving plumes and glittering spears
The fool took notice and slowly arose
Not quite so sure was his foolish heart
If priests and women would none of him
Was it likely a knight would take his part
They sang as they rode these lusty boys
When one chanced to turn toward the highways side
Theres a sorry figure of fun jested he
Well Sirrah move back there is scarce room to ride
Good Sirs Kind Sirs begged the crestfallen fool
I pray of your courtesy speech with you
Im for yonder town and have no horse to ride
Have you never a charger will carry two
Then the company halted and laughed out loud
Was such a request ever made to a knight
And where are your legs asked one if you start
You may be inside the town gates tonight
T is a lazy fellow let him alone
Theyve no room in the town for such idlers as he
But one bent from his saddle and said My man
Art thou not ashamed to beg charity
Thou art well set up and thy legs are strong
But it much misgives me lest thourt a fool
For beggars get only a beggars crust
Wise men are reared in a different school
Then they clattered away in the dust and the wind
And the fool slunk back to his lonely stone
He began to see that the man who asks
Must likewise give and not ask alone
Purple treeshadows crept over the road
The level sun flung an orange light
And the fool laid his head on the hard gray stone
And wept as he realized advancing night
A great round moon rose over a hill
And the steady wind blew yet more cool
And crouched on a stone a wayfarer sobbed
For at last he knew he was only a fool
The Green Bowl
This little bowl is like a mossy pool
In a Spring wood where dogtooth violets grow
Nodding in chequered sunshine of the trees
A quiet place still with the sound of birds
Where though unseen is heard the endless song
And murmur of the never resting sea
T was winter Roger when you made this cup
But coming Spring guided your eager hand
And round the edge you fashioned young green leaves
A proper chalice made to hold the shy
And little flowers of the woods  And here
They will forget their sad uprooting lost
In pleasure that this circle of bright leaves
Should be their setting once more they will dream
They hear winds wandering through lofty trees
And see the sun smiling between the leaves
Hora Stellatrix
The stars hang thick in the apple tree
The south wind smells of the pungent sea
Gold tulip cups are heavy with dew
The nights for you Sweetheart for you
Starfire rains from the vaulted blue
Listen  The dancing of unseen leaves
A drowsy swallow stirs in the eaves
