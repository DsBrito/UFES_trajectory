B J and R who took their places on the roof the better to command
the view are seen at the moment when the idea occurred to the two
former that they might possibly not fit under the archway Robinson is
so wrapped up in thought and a cigar that he is unconscious of all
else
This represents the Cologne omnibus on its journey from the station into
the city when stopped by the military and made to stand and deliver
the passports
Arrival at the hotel and first coming in sight of that amiable and
obliging race the German waiter He is small in stature scarcely the
size of life as Jones remarked and remains always a boy

COLOGNE TO BONN
The railway from Cologne to Bonn B J and R Just in time
First glimpse of Rhine scenery
BONN
Joness little all is contained in this small portmanteau
Robinson on the contrary finds it quite impossible to move with less
than this
This scene represents the Rhine boat about to start from Bonn and
passengers from the railway embarking In the foreground an accident has
occurred a porter having upset the luggage of an English family the
head of which is saluting him with the national Damn while the
courier of the party expresses the same idea in German
THE RHINE
BROWNS FIRST IMPRESSION OF THE RHINE
From an ORIGINAL SKETCH in the possession of his family
HEADS OF THE NATIVES
A Leaf from Browns Sketch Book
COMPANY ON BOARD THE RHINE BOAT
Amongst them was a travelling tutor and three young gentlemen his
pupils He stood in the midst of them smiling blandly an open volume in
his hand probably a classic author between which and his pupils
and the scenery he divided his attention in about equal parts There
was a specimen of the English grumbler big burly and as if in danger
of choking from the tightness of his cravat Every one knows him his
pleasant ways and his constant flow of good humour and cheerfulness
that is he sitting to the right There were besides numerous young
gentlemen from the universities from the army from the bar all with
more or less hair on their upper lips and there was a cavalry officer
of the Russian guard and a professor on his way to Heidelberg and
loose dishevelled hairy smoky young Germans with long beards and
longer pipes And there was a British nobleman and a British alderman
and a British alderwoman and there were British ladies whom I cant
describe because they wore those ugly things which prevent them being
seen intelligent young Americans on their way all over the world nuns
with their quiet happy faces Red Republicans from Frankfort and snobs
from London
THE GREAT BRITON
As he stood contemplating the Rhineland wondering if it would be
possible to live in that country and considering supposing he had one
of those castles now how many thousands ayear one could do it with
The scenery would do and with English institutions it might be made a
good thing of
NB He little thinks what Brown is doing
Even the nun was not safe from Brown He is here seen taking her off in
a rapid act of sketching
B J and R had just begun to enjoy the scenery when to their
consternation who should appear on board but the Bore who instantly
was down upon them For three mortal hours he entertained them with
fashionable intelligence anecdotes of the aristocracy the court
circular births deaths marriages c
This was supposed to be an MP travelling in search of facts He is
giving Brown his views and also the statistics of everything
A VIEW ON THE RHINE
THE LONDON GENT UP THE RHINE
He is taken at the moment when expressing his opinion that the whole
concern is a do and a sell
BRITISH FARMER AND SON IN FOREIGN PARTS
They both wore a perpetual grin and stare of surprise Jones thought
that they had taken leave of England and their senses at once owing to
the withdrawal of protection
THE RHINE BOAT
Brown may be seen seated there upon the paddlebox rapidly sketching
every church ruined castle town or other object of interest on either
bank of the river Those are Jones and Robinson leaning over the side
of the boat below him Observe also the stout party who has called for
brandyandwater and whose countenance almost lapses into a smile as
Kellner approaches with the beverage The tutor it is pleasant to
see has at last put his Classic in his pocket and gives himself up
to the undivided enjoyment of the scene while his young charge is
wrapped in contemplation of mechanical science as exemplified in the
structure of the wheel And that must surely be the gent who has such a
low opinion of the beauty of the Rhineland seated at the stern of the
boat with his legs dangling over the river Let us hope that he is happy
now
THE ENGLISH MILORD UPON THE RHINE
How happy he looks He dislikes the hum of men and sits all day shut up
in his carriage reading the literature of his country How rude of those
Germans to be laughing and joking so near his lordship
PERFECT ENJOYMENT
COBLENTZ
Indignation of Robinson at sight of inadequate washing apparatus He
rang the bell with such violence that all the waiters rushed in
thinking that the hotel was on fire or that a revolution had broken
out
There he stood pointing to the water about half a pint in a basin the
size of a breakfast cup and in a voice of suppressed emotion demanding
to know if Das ist etc
JONESS NIGHT THOUGHTS
Man wants but little here below but wants that little long
If you should forget the number of your key and room as BROWN did on
returning late from the theatre what are you to do
An Incident in the Life of Joness Dog
How this animal seemed to have imbibed communistic principles and how
he stole a sausage and how the population rose like one man and hunted
him through the town
The dog having outstripped the populace proceeds to eat the sausage
Having done so he looks stouter than he did and is inclined to rest
The inhabitants eager for vengeance surround him but are kept at bay
by the expression of his countenance
One burly peasant having the hardihood to approach too near he is made
as example of Exeunt omnes
THE RHINE
Brown with noble perseverance sits upon the paddlebox regardless of
the storm and sketches the castles and towns as the steamboat passes
them
Till in a moment of grief his hat and several sketches were carried
off for ever and then he thought it time to go below
How a citizen of the United States addressed Brown and how he put the
following questions during the first five minutes of their acquaintance
1 Where are you going
2 What place do you hail from
3 Conclude you go toe Frankfort
4 Youre Mr Brown I reckon
5 What names do your friends go by
Statements made during the same period
1 This here Rhine aint much by the side of our Mississippi
2 Old Europe is tarnally chawed up
BROWNS HAT
Robinson was very merry about this incident and both he and Jones kept
poking fun at Brown during the rest of the day They parodied the well
known song of My hearts on the Rhine substituting My hats in the
Rhineit was very poor stuff we have been assured by Brownand
they made pointed allusions to the name of WideAwake
The above drawing is from a rude sketch by Jones
THE SCENERY BECOMES MYSTERIOUS
They now became enveloped in what seemed a combination of fog
London November and mist Scotch Only think of those two national
institutions going up the Rhine with the rest of the fashionable world
At first it obscured the hill tops with the ruins thereon then the
villages and vineyards below and finally both banks of the river
entirely disappeared The company on board the steamboat did not
at this period present the most cheerful aspect
MAYENCE TO FRANKFORT
How Robinsons favourite portmanteau which he had forgotten to lock
was dropped accidentally by a porter while conveying it to the omnibus
Jones hints to Robinson that it is time to get up
FRANKFORT
How they visited a quarter of the city of Frankfort and what they saw
there
Robinson here wrote his celebrated letter to the Times on the subject
of the deficiency of soap and water from which as we have seen in a
former page he suffered so grievously It was conceived in terms of
indignant eloquence and drew a terrible picture of the state of social
political and religious degradation into which a country must have
sunk where such things could be tolerated
As they walked through the town bent upon seeing the Ariadne and
unconscious of danger suddenly an object appeared in sight that filled
them with terror It was the Bore stepping jauntily along on the
other side of the street To hesitate was to be lost So they plunged
into the nearest shop for protection and stood there breathless with
expectation and fear Presently Jonesputting his head very gradually
outreconnoitred and finding all safe they resumed their way
Robinson thinks it the thing to encourage native industry wherever he
goes and so buys a German pipe
HEIDELBERG
Kellner
While Brown Jones and Robinson supped a party of philosophers carry
on an sthetical discussion with an accompaniment of pipes and beer
The night was beautiful so we determined after supper to have
a look at the celebrated castleJones and I did that is to say for
Robinson was so fatigued with travel that he declined moving muttering
something about Castle can wait We ascended the moon shone brightly
through the ruins and bathed the landscape in its silvery light the
beautiful Neckar flowing at our feet Under us lay the town a thousand
lights twinkling in the stillness      Suddenly to our horror
there appeared upon the terrace The Bore Extract from Browns
Journal
At last he left us But not before he had taken from his pocket a
letter received that morning from Green You know Green of course
he said everybody does and read it aloud from beginning to end It
told of a good thing said at the club by Smith and of two marriages
and a duel likely to come off besides several interesting particulars
regarding the winner of the St Leger Ibid
When Jones and Brown were left once more alone they wandered and
pondered amongst the ruins and moralised over the instability of
thingsthey were even becoming sentimentalwhen suddenly a terrific
sound was heardlike the barking of a dogand the next moment the
animal himself was seen emerging from the darkness and making towards
them at the top of his speed They turned and fled
Meeting by moonlight
Robinson after the departure of Jones and Brown seated himself before
the fire and fell fast asleep
He continued in that state notwithstanding that the philosophers became
very noisy and even warlike
And althoughafter the latter had retired fortunately without coming
to blowshis chair toppled over he quietly assumed a horizontal
position
Fancy the feelings of Jones and Brown on returning and finding their
friend lying on his back upon the floor snoring
They lifted him up and carried him off to bed
Next morning they entertained Robinson with a thrilling account of the
dangers of their expedition in which that dreadful dog filled a very
large space
The above will give some faint idea of what they pictured to themselves
and to Robinson
THE REVIEW
Brown Jones and Robinson have arrived at  the capital of  a
small German state we wont say which as it would be giving it an
undue distinction and might offend the others
They have been received with distinguished consideration the local
paper having announced their arrival as Count Robinson Sir Brown and
the Rev Jones They have been invited to be present at a grand review
and Robinsonwho amongst other necessaries in those portmanteaus of
his carried a uniform as Captain of Yeomanrythought that this was
just the proper occasion to appear in it Accordingly he rode on to the
ground upon a charger hired in the character of a warrior with a
solemnity of countenance befitting the scene and his country and
accompanied by Jones also mounted but in the costume of an ordinary
individual of the period Brown preferred going on foot That is
Robinson in the centre Just at the time when he ought to be riding up
the line inspecting the troops with the Grand Duke and his staffhis
horse a disgusting brute as Robinson afterwards described him who
could not have been in the habit of carrying gentlemen suddenly stood
on his hind legs in the very middle of the field so that his rider was
forced to cling on to him in an absurd manner in full view of the army
the people and the court
R at that moment earnestly desired that the earth might open and
swallow him

Of the Adventure that befel Jones
I
Joness dog having come upon a sentinel and struck perhaps by his
small size compared with the sentinels he is used to commences to say
Bowwowwowwewuu
The soldier offended by these remarks presents for the animals
consideration the point of his bayonet
II
Jones expostulates with that freedom of speech which is the birthright
of every Englishman
III
But obtaining no satisfaction calls on the miserable foreigner to
Come on
IV
First and last round The soldier did Come on frowning Jones
received him smiling The soldier made play with his musket Jones
put in his left They closed and a terrific struggle ensued in the
course of which Jones got his adversarys Nob into Chancery
V
The soldier at this point unable to use his arms took to his legs
and administered a series of kicks upon the shins of Jones who in
return seized him lifted him in the air and threw him
VI
Then considering that justice and the honour of his country were alike
satisfied he retired leaving the body of his antagonist on the field
VII
Shows the body on discovering that life was not extinct attempting
to rise
PS He was last seen making frantic efforts to regain his feet and
seemingly prevented from doing so by the weight of his knapsack and
other accoutrements
VIII
Jones was late at breakfast he found Robinson reading Galignani and
Brown looking out of window and after giving them an amusing account of
the fun he had had was just sitting down to the table when Brown
shouted out By Jove there is a regiment of soldiers coming down the
street
IX
At first Jones was incredulous but presently Brown his hair standing
on end rushed towards him and in a voice of agony cried As sure as
we are alive they have stopped in front of the house and the OFFICER
IS COMING IN
X
It was too true The soldiers had come to look after the Englishman who
had attacked and beaten their comrade
XI
After a few moments of breathless suspense the officer entersJones
stands like a man about to struggle with adversity
XII
Nevertheless he is arrested and marched off
XIII
Robinson in agony calls for his coat and hat For as he cried out
to Brown not a moment is to be lost in endeavouring to see the British
Minister
XIV
They gain an audience of His Excellency the British Minister and ask
his interference in behalf of a persecuted countryman
We are happy to add that the interference was quite successful Jones
was liberated immediately and shortly afterwards the British Minister
for Foreign Affairs in a despatch to the German Minister for the same
expressed his conviction that The whole civilised world reprobated
with one voice a system at once tyrannical and cruel a remnant of the
darkest ages of mans history and utterly unworthy of the present era
of progress and enlightenment
Our friends were advised however to leave the country as soon and as
quietly as possible They departed accordingly

The safest way of coming down a mountain
We got out of the diligence at a time when it was obliged to go very
slowly in order to make an excursion on foot in search of the
picturesque being told that we might meet the carriage at a certain
point about a mile further on We saw many magnificent views and did a
great deal of what might be called rough walking but perhaps the thing
that struck us most was that on emerging at the appointed spot for
rejoining the diligence we beheld it a speck in the distance just
departing out of sight Extract from Joness Journal
The seven ages of Robinsons beard
What are they to do now
DESCENT OF THE ST GOTHARD
Having taken their places on the outside of the diligence Brown Jones
and Robinson can the better enjoy the grandeur of the scenery
They see Italy in the distance
A meeting on the mountain
Pilgrims coming down the Hill of Difficulty
ITALY
BREAKFAST AT BELLINZONA
It was their first day in Italy and how they did enjoy it The repast
was served in a stone summerhouse attached to the hotel The sun was so
bright and so hot the sky was so blue the vegetation so green the
mountains so purple the grapes so large and everything so beautiful
that Brown and Jones both decided that the scene fully realised all
their imaginings of Italy Robinson was enthusiastic too at first and
was beginning to say something about Italia O Italia when his eye
lit upon a green lizard running up the wall From that moment he was
more subdued
How they got Robinson up the hills
ITALIAN LAKES
They land upon Austrian territory en route for Milan While the proper
officer takes possession of their passports the whole available
population pounces upon the luggage and after apportioning it into
small allotments carries it off to the custom house
The official here is seen pointing on the scent as he thinks of
contraband goods in one of Robinsons portmanteaus He did not find
but in the hunt tossed Rs things dreadfully Brown revenged the
wrongs of self and friends by taking a full length on the spot of
that imposing administrator who stands over there with the passports
in his hand
Excelsior

Buon giorno
EVENING ON THE LAGO MAGGIORE
Knowest thou the land where the grapes are as plentiful as
blackberries in England and where one has only to stop a minute at the
roadside and pull no end of em O tis there tis there etc
Robinsons letters to his kinsfolk
MARIE
Oh Marie of the Lago dOrta maid of the inn and most beautiful of
waitresses how well do I remember thee How graceful were all thy
movements what natural ease together with what a dignified reserve
How truly a lady wert thou You did not know it but when you waited
upon us I always felt inclined to jump up from my chair and open
the door for you to take the dishes from your hands to ask you
respectfully to be seated to wait upon you in fact And O How I did
detest that wicked old landlady your mistress who used to bully and
scold you And I wonder whether you remember me From a MS very
rare in possession of Brown
This picture represents Brown as he appeared his feelings being too
many for him on hearing that elderly shedragon the landlady venting
her illhumour upon the gentle Marie He stole out of the diningroom
looked over into the yard and there beheld the furious old female
shaking her fist and pouring forth a torrent of abuse Brown was not
naturally of a savage temperament but at that moment he felt that he
could havebut it is best not to say what he could have doneit was
too terrible for publication in these pages

THE INN
How Brown returning from sketching was beset by beggars in a lonely
place
MILAN
They pay a visit to the marionette theatre
A snob they saw writing his name upon roof of Milan cathedral
ENLIGHTENED BEHAVIOUR IN A FOREIGN CHURCH
We are happy to say that B J and R had no connection with the above
party
Robinsons determination to let his beard grow naturally had an
absurd result the hair growing in violent and abrupt crops in some
places and not at all in others so that Jones who was sensitive about
appearances and whose own moustache was doing beautifully insisted
at last upon Rs being shaved which event accordingly took place in
the city of Milan It was well that Robinson consented for the barber
eyed him eagerly and as if he would spring upon him and shave him by
force
CAFE MILANSUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED ARRIVAL OF DISTINGUISHED FOREIGNERS
The moment we seated ourselves in a cafe an awful group of beggars
stood before usso suddenly that they appeared to have come up through
a trapdoorand demanded alms They would not go without money and
when they got it they took it as a right It would not do for one of us
to settle with them for the whole party for no sooner had I given
them a coin than they turned to Jones and when done with him coolly
set upon Robinson The instant one tribe departed a fresh relais
arrived so that there was a constant supply of beggars and demand on
our purses
No place seemed safe in the most magnificent and luxuriouslydecorated
cafes they had perfect right of way the contrast between the rich
gilding glass fountains etc of the one and the rags dirt and
dramatically gotup horrors of the other being picturesque but
certainly not pleasant and yet as Jones remarked they say this
country has not free institutions
VERONA
THE AMPHITHEATRE VERONA
Jones asks Robinson whether he Sees before him the gladiator die but
Robinson maintains a dignified silence
Austrian detective stops Brown to examine his sketching stool It
puzzles him There is an air of mystery about it It might possibly be a
weapon to be used for political purposes or an infernal machine Who
knows On the whole he thinks he had better detain it
SCENEDISCOVERS BROWN SKETCHING
Enter the Austrian army They advance upon him they think he is taking
the fortifications
Robinson who is much given to quotation is at the very moment
languidly reciting the lines
Am I in Italy Is this the Mincius
And those the distant turrets of Verona
And shall I sup where Juliet at the masque
Saw her loved Montague etc etc
Not being familiar with the German or the Croatian language Brown is
helpless He protests his innocence but the military dont understand
him They see treason in his hat which is of an illegal shape and they
arrest him
Jones and Robinson appear to the surprise of the military and relief
of Brown
Brown quite resigned walks quietly to meet his fate Jones plunges
violently but is finally overcome Robinson resists passively and is
accordingly dragged along
SKETCHES FOUND UPON BROWN
They are brought before the Governor That is he seated at the table
the soldiers showing him the libellous representations of the Croats
found in Browns portfolio The latter expects to be ordered for instant
execution but Jones assumes an air of great dignity and says Civis
Romanus sum
The Governor FieldMarshal Lieutenant Count Brown of the Imperial
service discovers in his prisoner a near relation of his own and our
friend is instantly locked in the embrace of that distinguished warrior
Jones remarked Alls well that ends well and Robinson greatly
relieved broke out with
Thus may each nephew whom chance directs
Find an uncle when he least expects
VENICE
EXAMINATION OF PASSPORTS
HOTEL
MODERN VENETIAN TROUBADOURS
An evening scene before the Cafe Florian Piazza San Marco
Brown at this period undertook at the urgent request of Jones and
Robinson to settle the accounts of the party which had become
complicated owing to that perplexing medium to those unused to it
