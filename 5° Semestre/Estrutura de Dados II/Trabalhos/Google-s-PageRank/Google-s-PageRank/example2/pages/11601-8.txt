Blois without the sanction of the KingFalse confidence of De
LuynesThe malcontents are brought to trialWeakness of the
ministersPolitical executionsIndignation of the peopleThe Princes
resolve to liberate the Queenmother
It will be remembered that Marie de Medicis left the capital under a
pledge from her son himself that she was at perfect liberty to change
her place of abode whenever she should deem it expedient to do so and
that her sojourn at Blois was merely provisional and intended as a
temporary measure to enable her to establish herself more commodiously
in her own castle of Monceaux Anxious for her absence De Luynes had
induced the King to consent to her wishes but she had no sooner reached
Blois than he determined that she should be compelled to remain there
as he dreaded her influence in a province of which she was the absolute
mistress and accordingly she had no sooner arrived in the
fortresspalace on the Loire than he began to adopt the necessary
measures for her detention Within a week she was surrounded by spies a
precaution which would appear to have been supererogatory so long as
Richelieu remained about her person as his first care on reaching Blois
was to write to the favourite to repeat his offers of service and he
himself informs us that from time to time he sent him an exact account
of the Queens proceedings while so much anxiety did he evince to
retain the confidence of the Court party that when Marie desirous of
repaying the sacrifice which she believed him to have made in following
her fortunes appointed him chief of her Council he refused to accept
this office until he had written to obtain the sanction of the King and
publicly declared that he would not occupy any official situation
whatever in her service until he ascertained the pleasure of
his Majesty
These servile scruples did not however as he himself admits suffice
to set at rest the suspicions of De Luynes whose knowledge of the
Bishops character by no means tended to inspire him with any confidence
in his professions1 while the Queenmother on her side had soon
cause to apprehend that the motives of Richelieu for his selfbanishment
were far less honourable than those which she had been so eager to
attribute to him Certain projects which she was anxious to keep
profoundly secret became known to the favourite and her natural
distrust coupled with this fact induced her to be gradually less
communicative to the intriguing prelate Her spirits moreover gave way
under the successive mortifications to which she was subjected and
combined with her somewhat tardy but deep regret at the fate of the
Marechal dAncre were fears for her own safety which appeared to be
daily threatened
Her residence at Monceaux was soon in readiness for her reception but
when she apprised the King of her intention of removing thither she
received an evasive reply and was courteously but peremptorily advised
to defer her journey Marie de Medicis from that moment fully
comprehended her real position but with a tact and dissimulation equal
to that of Louis himself she professed the most perfect indifference on
the subject and submitted without any remonstrance to the expressed
wish of her son This resignation to his will flattered the vanity of
Louis and quieted the fears of his favourite but it by no means
deceived the subtle Richelieu who aware of the inherent ambition of
Marie de Medicis at once felt convinced that she was preoccupied with
some important design and consequently indisposed to waste her energies
upon questions of minor moment At short intervals she addressed the
most submissive letters to the King assuring him of her devoted
attachment to his interests and her desire to obey his wishes in all
things but these assurances produced no effect upon the mind of Louis
