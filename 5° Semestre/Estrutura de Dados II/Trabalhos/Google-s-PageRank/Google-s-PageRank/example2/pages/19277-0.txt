NABALaS NARRATIVE
Feel impelled appeal entire body American believers to henceforth regard
NabAlas soulstirring Narrative as essential adjunct to reconstructed
Teaching program as unchallengeable textbook in their Summer Schools as
source of inspiration in all literary and artistic pursuits as an
invaluable companion in times of leisure as indispensable preliminary to
future pilgrimage to BahAauallAhas native land and as unfailing
instrument to allay distress and resist attacks of critical disillusioned
humanity
Cablegram June 21 1932
IMMORTAL SPIRIT
Greatest Holy Leafas immortal spirit winged its flight Great Beyond
Countless lovers her saintly life in East and West seized with pangs of
anguish Plunged in utterable sorrow humanity shall ere long recognize its
irreparable loss Our beloved Faith well nigh crushed by devastating blow
of aAbdualBahAas unexpected Ascension now laments passing of last
remnant of BahAauallAh its most exalted member Holy Family cruelly
divested of its most precious great Adorning I for my part bewail sudden
removal of my sole earthly sustainer the joy and solace of my life
Remains will repose in the vicinity of the Holy Shrines So grievous a
bereavement necessitates suspension for nine months through BahAaA world
every manner religious festivity Inform Local Assemblies and groups hold
in befitting manner memorial gatherings to extol a life so laden with
sacred experiences so rich in imperishable memories Advise holding
additional Commemoration Service of strictly devotional character in the
Auditorium of the MashriqualAdhkAr
Cablegram July 15 1932
UNITED WILL CONCERTED ACTION
I am deeply conscious of the many obstacles that stand in the path of the
American believers in their stupendous endeavor to attain their goalaa
goal on which our dearly beloved Greatest Holy Leaf had set her fondest
hopes I cannot however overlook much as I sympathize with them in
their financial tribulations and anxieties the mysterious power that
resides in the united will and concerted action of all the members of that
selfsacrificing communityaa community which since the passing of
aAbdualBahA has put an impetus to the advancement of the Cause out of
all proportion to its numerical strength its youthfulness and experience
of the powers latent in this sacred Faith What an untold wealth of
blessings will flow out of a renewed an irrevocable resolution
representing the combined will of all the steadfast lovers of the Cause of
God in that land to carry out in its entirety during the few remaining
months a Plan on which so much that is vital to its worldwide interests
depends The American believers the stouthearted supporters of the Faith
of BahAauallAh have already given too many evidences of their
preponderating influence in the direction of its affairs to allow the
slightest disappointment to mar the radiance of their past achievements
Their will to succeed must eventually triumph
October 27 1932
NONPARTICIPATION IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS
The handling of this delicate and vital problem regarding
nonparticipation by BahAaAs of East and West in political affairs calls
for the utmost circumspection tact patience and vigilance on the part
of those whose function and privilege it is to guard promote and
administer the activities of a worldwide everadvancing Cause The
misgivings and apprehensions of individual BahAaAs should be allayed and
eventually completely dispelled Any misconception of the sane and genuine
patriotism that animates every BahAaA heart if it ever obscures or
perplexes the minds of responsible government officials should be
instantly and courageously dissipated Any deliberate misrepresentation by
the enemies of the Cause of God of the aims the tenets and methods of the
administrators of the Faith of BahAauallAh should be vigorously faced and
its fallacy pitilessly exposed The Cause to which we belong stands on the
threshold of an era of unprecedented expansion Its problems are many
diverse and challenging Our methods and ways of approach must likewise be
characterized by unusual sagacity consummate skill and wisdom He will
surely never fail us in meeting the needs of a critical hour
March 16 1933
PERSONALITIES SUBORDINATED
Concerning the removal of believers I feel that such a vitally important
matter should be given the most serious consideration and preferably be
referred to the National Assembly for further consideration and final
decision We should be slow to accept and reluctant to remove I fully
approve and wholeheartedly and unreservedly uphold the principle to which
you refer that personalities should not be made centers around which the
community may revolve but that they should be subordinated under all
conditions and however great their merits to the properly constituted
Assemblies You and your coworkers can never overestimate or
overemphasize this cardinal principle of BahAaA Administration
April 11 1933
MOMENTOUS CONVENTION
Message to 1933 Convention
Entire BahAaA world stirred with expectations to witness results of
American believersa momentous Convention On its proceedings hang issue of
incalculable benefit to worldwide Faith of BahAauallAh To its delegates
is given great opportunity to release forces which will usher in an era
whose splendor must outshine the heroic age of our beloved Cause Supreme
Concourse waiting for them to seize it

AN EMINENT RANK
Keithas precious life offered up in sacrifice to beloved Cause in
BahAauallAhas native land On Persian soil for Persiaas sake she
encountered challenged and fought the forces of darkness with high
distinction indomitable will unswerving exemplary loyalty The mass of
her helpless Persian brethren mourns the sudden loss of their valiant
emancipator American believers grateful and proud of the memory of their
first and distinguished martyr Sorrow stricken I lament my earthly
separation from an invaluable collaborator an unfailing counselor an
esteemed and faithful friend I urge the Local Assemblies befittingly to
organize memorial gatherings in memory of one whose international services
entitled her to an eminent rank among the Hands of the Cause of
BahAauallAh
Cablegram October 30 1933
POTENTIALITIES OF MAJESTIC EDIFICE
Message to 1934 Convention
American believersa inspired leadership steadily unfolding to BahAaAs
world over the potentialities of the majestic edifice heralding formative
period of the Faith of BahAauallAh Their unerring vision conceived its
matchless design aAbdualBahAas own hands laid its cornerstone Their
dynamic faith reared its structure Their sustained selfsacrifice crowned
it with immortal glory May the flame of their unconquerable enthusiasm
continue glowing undimmed in their hearts till its naked frame is
enveloped in its shining mantle
Cablegram June 4 1934
THE VOTING RIGHT
I feel I must reaffirm the vital importance and necessity of the right of
votingaa sacred responsibility of which no adult recognized believer
should be deprived unless he is associated with a community that has not
as yet been in a position to establish a local Assembly This
distinguishing right which the believer possesses however does not carry
with it nor does it imply an obligation to cast his vote if he feels that
the circumstances under which he lives do not justify or allow him to
exercise that right intelligently and with understanding This is a matter
which should be left to the individual to decide himself according to his
own conscience and discretion
April 28 1935
UNPRECEDENTED IMPETUS
Message to 1935 Convention
Heartily reciprocate sentiments conveyed in your message Appeal to
assembled delegates and incoming National Assembly to deliberate on
measures required to stimulate all local communities and groups to lend
immediate unprecedented impetus to teaching activities throughout United
States and Canada Sustained concentration on this paramount issue can
alone reveal the potentialities of beloved Temple and enable the superb
selfsacrifice associated with it to yield its fairest fruit
Cablegram April 29 1935
SEPARATION FROM OUTWORN CREEDS
The separation that set in between the institutions of the BahAaA Faith
and the Islamic ecclesiastical organizations that oppose itaa movement
that has originated in Egypt and is now spreading steadily throughout the
middle East and will in time communicate its influence to the Westaimposes
upon every loyal upholder of the Cause the obligation of refraining from
any word or action that might prejudice the position which our enemies
have in recent years and of their own accord proclaimed and established
This historic development the beginnings of which could neither be
recognized nor even anticipated in the years immediately preceding
aAbdualBahAas passing may be said to have signalized the Formative
Period of our Faith and to have paved the way for the consolidation of its
administrative order As this movement gains momentum as it receives
added impetus from the attitude and future action of the civil authorities
in Persia it will inevitably manifest its repercussions in the West and
will rouse the leaders of the Church and finally the civil authorities to
challenge the claims and eventually to recognize the independent status of
the Religion of BahAauallAh Nothing whatever in the meantime should be
said or done by any of us whether in the political field or in our
relations with ecclesiastical organizations that would tend to confuse
the issues with which our struggling Cause will sooner or later be
confronted We should accept no position should avoid any affiliations or
commitments that could in any way harm our future position or provide our
potential enemies with weapons with which they can resist that complete
emancipation of our Cause or retard its ultimate recognition and victory
Though our Cause unreservedly recognizes the Divine origin of all the
religions that preceded it and upholds the spiritual truths which lie at
their very core and are common to them all its institutions whether
administrative religious or humanitarian must if their distinctive
character is to be maintained and recognized be increasingly divorced
from the outworn creeds the meaningless ceremonials and manmade
institutions with which these religions are at present identified Our
adversaries in the East have initiated the struggle Our future opponents
in the West will in their turn arise and carry it a stage further Ours
is the duty in anticipation of this inevitable contest to uphold
unequivocally and with undivided loyalty the integrity of our Faith and
demonstrate the distinguishing features of its divinely appointed
institutions
June 15 1935
THE NATIONAL FUND
As the activities of the American BahAaA community expand and its
worldwide prestige correspondingly increases the institution of the
National Fund the bedrock on which all other institutions must
necessarily rest and be established acquires added importance and should
be increasingly supported by the entire body of the believers both in
their individual capacities and through their collective efforts whether
organized as groups or as local Assemblies The supply of funds in
support of the National Treasury constitutes at the present time the
lifeblood of those nascent institutions which you are laboring to erect
Its importance cannot surely be overestimated Untold blessings shall no
doubt crown every effort directed to that end I am eagerly and
prayerfully awaiting the news of an unprecedented expansion in so vital an
organ of the administrative Order of the Faith
July 29 1935
THE NEW HOUR HAS STRUCK
Convey to assembled believers celebrating termination entire dome unit of
MashriqualAdhkAr my heartfelt congratulations on triumphant progress
of their undeniably glorious enterprise To prayers and testimonies
ascending to Throne of BahAauallAh I am moved to add my fervent though
inadequate tribute to solidarity of so dazzling an achievement The forces
which progressive revelation of this mighty symbol of our Faith is fast
releasing in heart of a sorely tried continent no one of this generation
can correctly appraise The new hour has struck in history of our beloved
Cause calling for nationwide systematic sustained efforts in teaching
field enabling thereby these forces to be directed into such channels as
shall redound to the glory of our Faith and to the honor of its
institutions
Cablegram October 26 1935
THIS IS TRULY PROVIDENTIAL
This new stage in the gradual unfoldment of the Formative Period of our
Faith into which we have just enteredathe phase of concentrated teaching
activityasynchronizes with a period of deepening gloom of universal
impotence of everincreasing destitution and widespread disillusionment
in the fortunes of a declining age This is truly providential and its
significance and the opportunities it offers us should be fully
apprehended and utilized Now that the administrative organs of a firmly
established Faith are vigorously and harmoniously functioning and now
that the Symbol ie the House of Worship of its invincible might is
lending unprecedented impetus to its spread an effort unexampled in its
scope and sustained vitality is urgently required so that the moving
spirit of its Founder may permeate and transform the lives of the
countless multitudes that hunger for its teachings That the beloved
friends in America who have carried triumphantly the banner of His Cause
through the initial stages of its development will in a still greater
measure prove themselves capable of meeting the challenge of the present
hour I for one can never doubt Of the evidences of their inexhaustible
vitality I am sufficiently and continually conscious My fervent plea will
not I feel certain remain unanswered For them I shall continue to pray
from all my heart
January 10 1936
aABDUaLBAHAaS HISTORIC APPEAL
Message to 1936 Convention
Convey to American believers abiding gratitude efforts unitedly exerted in
teaching field Inaugurated campaigns should be vigorously pursued
systematically extended Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic
appeal voiced by aAbdualBahA in Tablets of the Divine Plan Urge earnest
deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete
fulfilment First Century of BahAaA era drawing to a close Humanity
entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence Opportunities of
present hour unimaginably precious Would to God every State within
American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere
termination of this glorious century1 embrace the light of the Faith of
BahAauallAh and establish structural basis of His World Order
Cablegram May 1 1936
FRESH CONQUESTS AND UNPRECEDENTED TRIUMPHS
I fervently hope and pray that the year into which we have just entered
may be signalized by fresh conquests and unprecedented triumphs in the
teaching field within the United States and beyond its confines A
systematic carefully conceived and wellestablished plan should be
devised rigorously pursued and continuously extended Initiated by the
National representatives of the American believers the vanguard and
standardbearers of the radiant army of BahAauallAh this plan should
receive the wholehearted the sustained and everincreasing support both
moral and financial of the entire body of His followers in that
continent Its supreme immediate objective should be the permanent
establishment of at least one center in every state of the American
Republic and in every Republic of the American continent not yet enlisted
under the banner of His Faith Its ramifications should gradually be
extended to the European continent and its scope should be made to
include those countries such as the Baltic States Poland Greece Spain
and Portugal where no avowed believer has established any definite
residence The field is immense the task gigantic the privilege
immeasurably precious Time is short and the obligation sacred paramount
and urgent The American community must muster all its force concentrate
its resources summon to its aid all the faith the determination and
energies of which it is capable and set out singleminded and undaunted
to attain still greater heights in its mighty exertions for the Cause of
BahAauallAh
May 30 1936
INTENSIFY TEACHING WORK A THOUSANDFOLD
I am eagerly awaiting the news of the progress of the activities initiated
to promote the teaching work within and beyond the confines of the
American continent The American believers if they wish to carry out in
the spirit and the letter the parting wishes of their beloved Master
must intensify their teaching work a thousandfold and extend its
ramifications beyond the confines of their native land and as far as the
most distant outposts of their farflung Faith The Tablets of the Divine
Plan invest your Assembly with unique and grave responsibilities and
confer upon it privileges which your sister Assemblies might well envy and
admire The present opportunity is unutterably precious It may not recur
again Undaunted by the perils and the uncertainties of the present hour
the American believers must press on and prosecute in its entirety the
task which now confronts them I pray for their success from the depths of
my heart
July 28 1936
THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE UNDERTAKING
I cannot allow this communication to be sent without adding a few words in
person and stress afresh the significance of the undertaking in which the
entire BahAaA community has embarked The promulgation of the Divine Plan
unveiled by our departed Master in the darkest days of one of the severest
ordeals which humanity has ever experienced is the key which Providence
has placed in the hands of the American believers whereby to unlock the
doors leading them to fulfil their unimaginably glorious Destiny As the
proclamation of the Message reverberates throughout the land as its
resistless march gathers momentum as the field of its operation widens
and the numbers of its upholders and champions multiply its
potentialities will correspondingly unfold exerting a most beneficent
influence not only on every community throughout the BahAaA world but on
the immediate fortunes of a travailing society The repercussions of this
campaign are already apparent in Europe India Egypt aIrAq and even
among the soretried communities in Persia and Russia The Faith of God is
gaining in stature effectiveness and power Not until however the great
enterprise which you are now conducting runs its full course and attains
its final objective at its appointed time can its worldencompassing
benefits be fully apprehended or revealed The perseverance of the
American believers will no doubt insure the ultimate realization of
these benefits
November 14 1936
A COMPLETE REDEDICATION
The progress of the teaching campaign is most remarkable and reassuring
the uninterrupted prosecution of this holy enterprise and its extension to
the South American continent and the islands of the Pacific will no doubt
attract unimaginable blessings and must entail farreaching consequences
In the course of this year when the American believers are commemorating
the 25th anniversary of aAbdualBahAas visit to America a mighty impetus
should be lent to this campaign which you have so splendidly initiated A
complete rededication to its ideals its purposes and requirements on the
part of all individuals and Assemblies can alone befit such a nationwide
celebration I pray that you may fulfil your high destiny
March 22 1937
INSTITUTION OF GUARDIANSHIP NOW FURTHER REINFORCED
Deeply moved by your message Institution of Guardianship head
cornerstone of the Administrative Order of the Cause of BahAauallAh
already ennobled through its organic connection with the Persons of Twin
Founders of the BahAaA Faith is now further reinforced through direct
association with West and particularly with the American believers whose
spiritual destiny is to usher in the World Order of BahAauallAh For my
part I desire to congratulate community of American believers on
acquisition of tie vitally binding them to so weighty an organ of their
Faith
Cablegram March 30 1937
DUAL GIFT
Message to 1937 Convention
Dual gift providentially conferred upon American BahAaA community invests
recipients with dual responsibility fulfil historic mission First
prosecute uninterruptedly teaching campaign inaugurated at last Convention
in accordance with Divine Plan Second resume with inflexible
determination exterior ornamentation of entire structure of Temple Advise

first century of BahAaA era than accomplishment of this twofold task
Advise prolongation of Convention sessions to enable delegates consult
National Assembly to formulate feasible Seven Year Plan to assure success
Temple enterprise No sacrifice too great for community so abundantly
blessed so repeatedly honored
Cablegram May 1 1937
THE CALL HAS GONE FORTH  THE PATH IS CLEAR
The responsibilities which under your direction and in response to my
plea the American community is now assuming over and above the task they
have already undertaken in connection with the Divine Plan proclaiming in
unmistakable terms their unswerving determination to prove themselves
worthy of the sublimity of their mission and of their privileged position
among their sister communities in both the East and the Westathe twofold
task they have arisen to perform will if carried out in time release the
potentialities with which the community of the Greatest Name has been so
generously and mysteriously endowed by aAbdualBahA To carry out in its
entirety and to its final consummation this dual enterprise would shed on
the closing years of this first century of the BahAaA Era a luster no less
brilliant than the immortal deeds which have signalized its birth in the
heroic age of our Faith To the American believers the spiritual
descendants of the heroes of Godas Cause I again address my plea to arise
as one soul and to prosecute with unrelaxing resolve the high mission with
which their immediate destiny is inextricably interwoven The call has
gone forth the path is clear the goal manifest and within their reach
Though their responsibilities be pressing and heavy and the obstacles
formidable and manifold yet the spirit of our invincible Faith will
enable them to conquer if they arise unitedly and determinedly and
persevere till the very end

Cablegram November 21 1937
ALL SHOULD ARISE
As I lift up my gaze beyond the strains and stresses which a struggling
Faith must necessarily experience and view the wider scene which the
indomitable will of the American BahAaA community is steadily unfolding I
can not but marvel at the range which the driving force of their ceaseless
labors has acquired and the heights which the sublimity of their faith has
attained The outposts of a Faith already persecuted in both Europe and
Asia are in the American continent steadily advancing the visible
symbols of its undoubted sovereignty are receiving fresh luster every day
and its manifold institutions are driving their roots deeper and deeper
into its soil Blest and honored as none among its sister communities has
been in recent years preserved through the inscrutable dispensations of
