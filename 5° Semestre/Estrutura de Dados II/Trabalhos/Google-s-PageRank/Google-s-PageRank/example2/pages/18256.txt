WOODSIDE
I
GRANDPAPAS HOUSE
Now for the dear dear country
Its trees and meadows fair
Its roses cowslips violets
Whose sweetness fills the air
Tis there we hear the music
Of larks and blackbirds song
And merry little finches
Singing the whole day longC H
One bright spring day not so very long ago three little children
arrived at their grandfathers house They had come to pay a long visit
as their parents were travelling abroad for two or three months
Now grandpapa lived less than twenty miles from London yet his house
was quite in the countryindeed you might have thought that it was a
hundred miles away from any townand it was called Woodside
You may be sure that Jack Mary and Anniefor those were the names of
the childrenthought the change from London most delightful
Jack was the eldestthat is why I have put his name before those of his
sistersand he was ten years old Mary was the next in age and she was
nearly nine while Annie the youngest was seven
On the day they arrived they felt very quiet all was so strange after
London besides they were busy unpacking their toys and picturebooks
and in finding places for all their treasures in the rooms grandmamma
had set apart for them
They went to bed early too and never once woke till their nurse called
them in the morning At first they felt sorry it was time to get up but
when Jane drew up the blinds and they saw the bright sunshine and the
clear blue sky they made haste to dress so that after breakfast was
over they might go out of doors
Each of them had visited at Woodside several times before but they had
not been all together there at the same time They knew very well how
many interesting things there were to see out of doors and they hoped
that there would be something new There was sure to be a difference
among the animals and flowers
The old house looked the same as they drove up to it with its twenty
oak trees in a semicircle and the gates in the middle There was the
same watchdog Lion and on the parlour hearthrug lying curled up in
the sunshine lay Smut grandmammas large black cat
A very respectable old gentleman was Smut with his sleek glossy coat
but he stood too much on his dignity ever to play The children coaxed
him and patted him yet he took no notice he just curled himself round
and went to sleep again
A proud old cat was Smut he would never touch food or milk in the
kitchen His food was put on a plate for him out of doors and he had
his milk in a saucer in the parlour When he was out of doors he always
came in again by the front door never at the back
The children soon spied something new in the shape of a longhaired
kitten whose fur was gray and soft She was bright and lively and was
very pleased to play with the children for Smut would never take any
notice of her or play with her one bit so she and the children became
very good friends and had many a game together
After breakfast was over grandmamma told the children they might put on
their hats and go out of doors They did not need to be spoken to twice
First of all they had a run round the garden peeped into the
greenhouse and said How do you do to the gardener But they did not
stop long among the lovely spring flowers for they were in such haste
to see the animals
Illustration THE VISIT TO THE PONY
Page 13
Jack said We must pay our first visit to the pony so away they went
to the stable
The pony was very sober and steady and I am sorry to add rather lazy
so the children did not get much fun out of him He lifted up his head
and gave a little neigh to Jack for he seemed to remember him and then
he went on eating his hay in the most unconcerned manner
They then went to see the large dog in the yard Lion was very glad to
see them He harked with delight wagged his tail rattled his chain in
fact he seemed as if he would break away from it in his eagerness to
meet the children
Lion is ever so much nicer than the pony they said
The fact was the pony had not much work to do and his chief thoughts
were about his hay and his corn and his nice warm stable Now Lion
although he was generally chained to his kennel had to watch for
others He was always listening to hear if any one came upon the
premises who had no business there and he barked so loudly that tramps
and idle people thought it best to go away He always welcomed the
gardener and the servants and especially his master whenever they came
to see him so that every one about the place would give a pat or a word
to the friendly dog whenever they passed that way
Now let us go and see the fowls said Mary
On the right hand side of the drive up to the house was a wide strip of
grass planted with shrubs Here standing back were some wire
enclosures inside of which were some choice broods of chickens
The girls could have stopped here for hours they said watching the
little chickens that looked like balls of white or yellow or gray down
running about or hiding under their mothers wings
However most of the fowls were in the orchard close by which was the
henhouse Fancy what a pretty sight that orchard was this sunshiny
spring morning How alive with different sorts of fowls running hither
and thitherblack and gray and speckled old motherly hens and pert
lively young ones while the cocks strutted about and crowed one against
another Then a hen would come out of the henhouse where the nests
were telling all the world by her loud proud cackling that she had
laid an egg What noise there was then for cocks and hens would all
join in chorus Some of the hens seemed to get together to have a quiet
chat as if they were talking over their family affairs about which
they did not always seem to agree if you might judge by their noise
By this time grandpapa had finished reading his newspaper and came to
the children He took them to the cowhouse to see the new calf and he
lifted Annie up to let her stroke it but the mother looked so fierce
that they did not care to stay long there Then they went into the yard
to see the pigs The little pigs looked so funny running about the
large clean sty as if they loved the bright sunshine and liked to play
about in it But when they fed they would put their feet in the trough
and this was not very mannerly of them
By the time the children had paid a visit to all the old places they
were getting rather tired and then they went back to the house
II
LISTENING IN THE WOODS
I hear the blackbird telling
His lovetale to his mate
And the merry skylark swelling
The choir at heavens gate
The cuckoo away in the thicket
Is giving his two old notes
And the pet doves hung by the wicket
Are talking with ruffled throats
The honeybee hums as he lingers
Where shadows on clover heads fall
And the wind with leaftipped fingers
Is playing in concert with all
ELIZA COOK
Now grandpapas house Woodside stood on the side of a wood in fact
there was only a grassy road between the gates and the wood itself
Such a wood with large old elms and oaks and other trees In the more
open spaces were trees and bushes of hawthorn now completely covered
with white blossom the pretty Maybloom There too grew primroses
violets wild hyacinths besides a long list of other wild flowers
ferns and feathery green moss
One fine day grandmamma took the children herself across the road into
the wood She sat down in one of the open spaces upon the trunk of a
fallen tree while the children played at hideandseek among the bushes
or picked the wild flowers
Byandby they came back to grandmamma who was reading while they were
playing about and said Grandmamma will you tell us about papa when
he was a little boy
Grandmamma took off her spectacles shut her book and the children sat
down quite close to her on the grass at her feet
Then she beganWhen your father and your uncle and aunts were about
as old as you are now they came with me into this very place one summer
day
After they had played awhile they came to me and I said to them
Children what do you hear
Hear mother they said why nothing in particular What is there
to hear
Well I said now all of you shut your eyes and listen and dont
speak till I tell you
After a short time I told them to open their eyes and I asked John
who was the eldest what he had heard
First of all I heard the birds singing then I noticed that there were
different sorts of birds singing I heard the blackbird the thrush the
little finches and the warblersI could not tell you how many some of
them singing as if they could not make sound enough and others sung a
low song with twitterings and chatterings all to themselves Some
seemed calling to birds a long way off then I heard those other birds
answer but the sound was so faint that I should not have heard it at
all if we had not been so still I was trying to catch a faint sound of
a bird some distance down the wood which sounded like the coo of the
woodpigeon when you said Open your eyes
Then I turned to Harryyour father childrenand he said Of course
I heard the birds but I thought I can hear them any day I shall
listen for all sorts of odd sounds I heard the distant rumble of a
farmers waggon and the cows lowing at Browns farm every now and
again I heard the sound of the village blacksmiths hammer the faint
puffing of a train a mans footsteps coming through the wood and the
voices of boysafter birds nests I suppose
Well Lizzie what did you hear I asked turning to one of the
girls
I heard the wind moving very gently among the trees making a soft
rustling noise I could scarcely believe in the difference there is
between this quiet sound and the roaring of the wind in a storm Then I
heard the wild bees hum and the little tiny noises made by the small
creatures that live in the wood I heard our gardener sharpening his
scythe and the trickling of the brook in the hollow
Now little Fanny tell us what you heard
I heard the hens cackling and calling to their chickens I thought I
heard our dog bark but all was so warm and still and sleepy that I
felt as if I should go to sleep too if I kept my eyes shut much longer
I heard the birds though and a great bumblebee that flew by when our
eyes were shut
Now children I said you have all heard something and yet a
little while ago you told me there was nothing particular to hear nor
is there if you hear without listening
Here grandmamma stopped awhile then looking at the grandchildren at
her feet said there was a poet once who wrote about a little girl
called Lucy She lived among all the beautiful things that are to be
seen in the country and she loved them dearly The poet thought how as
she grew up she would be yet more and more charmed by them and that
loving all grand and beautiful natural objects would make her charming
Among other things he said
She shall lean her ear
In many a secret place
And beauty born of murmuring sound
Shall pass into her face
How can sound show itself in a face grandmamma asked Jack
Supposing you heard a loud sudden scream you would be startled and
frightened by the cry if you heard a tremendous clap of thunder you
might look a little frightened too but you would also look solemn and
still as you heard the grand sound but you would have quite another
look if you were lying on your back under a shady tree some calm summer
evening listening to the low song of the birds and to the many sounds
that are almost silence
Cuckoo cuckoo
O grandmamma theres the cuckoo cried all the children at once
Yes there are a great many cuckoos about here They say it is only the
male bird that calls Cuckoo that the female simply makes a chattering
sound
Did you ever see a cuckoo grandma
No never a live bird only one stuffed I will tell you a story of how
I heard one once It was about fiveandtwenty years ago I wanted some
primroses for a nosegay I used to pick the long feathery moss that
grows in these woods and put the primroses among it I ran across the
road outside of our gatesfor I could run in those daysand soon
filled my basket with as many primroses as I wanted As I was standing
under a large tree I heard all at once exactly over my head a loud
gruff cry of Cuckoo I was so startled the cry was so near that I
thought it must be a rude man and I dropped all my primroses and ran
back to the gates
Then I thought How foolish of me to be frightened it is the 18th of
April the right time for the cuckoo to come back to England from the
warm country where he has been all the winterof course it is a real
cuckoo So I went back and picked up my primroses but I heard no more
of that cuckoo
I told my children when I came indoors about my adventure and how they
did laugh at their mother for being frightened at a bird
I shall always think though that that particular cuckoo must have
caught a bad cold on his long journey to England or soon after his
arrival for his voice sounded as if he had a sore throat
Now children said grandmamma rising from her seat it is time we
walked homewards
As they came near to the house they saw Smut sitting on the doorstep
waiting patiently to be let in at the front door
Within a short distance of the house was a brook almost hidden in
places by overhanging bushes and long reedy grass Then it flowed into
more open ground but it was very quiet in its flow for the bed was
soft and not stony
Of course the next day the children set off for this brook to listen to
its murmuring sound Jack lay down upon the ground and leaned his
head over the brook thinking he could hear better in that fashion Mary
said she should sit down by a bend in the stream and be comfortable for
she was sure she could not listen well if she were afraid of rolling
into the water while little Annie sat by her sisters side holding her
hand and shutting her eyes
If you had seen those children then you would have wondered what they
were doing they were so serious and intent but by the quiet look upon
their faces they seemed to enjoy the music of the softlyflowing stream
So low was the sound that you would hardly have noticed it if you had
not been thinking about it
Often during this visit they would have games at harking as they
called it for they said We may as well hear as much as we can as our
father and uncle and aunts did when they were children They would shut
their eyes for some minutes and then they would tell each other what
they had heard I can tell you their ears grew very sharp with all this
practice for like other children they had their quiet moods when
under the lofty forest trees or in the garden nooks they would listen
not for fun but for enjoyment

TOMS BIRDS EGGS
The goldfinch and blackbird and thrush
Are brimful of music and glee
They have each got a nest in some bush
And the rook has built his on a tree
BERNARD BARTON
About a mile off at the other end of the wood was a village which
joined an old town so closely that they seemed to be only one place
The old town was quiet now but it had been a very busy place many years
ago in the old coach days I cannot tell you how many coaches daily ran
through it or changed horses at the different inns on their way from
London to towns in distant parts of England
Now the railway had stopped every coach and in the valley through
these very woods the trains rushed along panting and puffing as if
they were running a race with Time
Fortunately the trains ran through a tunnel at this spot so the beauty
of the woods was not disturbed
There was a large green belonging to the village on the edge of which
lived the childrens aunt Lizzie who had married a doctor She had two
childrenTom who was eleven years old and Katey who was nine They
went to school daily in the adjoining town so they were unable to see
much of their cousins excepting upon halfholidays as it was now
school time
But you must not suppose that Jack and his sisters did nothing but play
during this long visit As soon as they had settled down grandmamma
engaged a young lady to come to teach them for about two hours every
morning Woodside was too far from the town for the children to go to
school with their cousins When they were at home they went to a
kindergarten school where they learned in the wisest and pleasantest
fashion
Illustration TOM SHOWING THE REDBREASTS EGGS
Page 29
The children always looked forward to the halfholidays when they
either went up to their cousins home or Tom and Katey came down to
them
One Saturday afternoon when they went to the green Tom showed them his
collection of birds eggs He kept them in shallow boxes full of bran
so that they should not get broken for he was very careful over them
Toms mother told him never to take more than one egg from each nest
unless there were a great many as there are in wrens nests so that
the mother bird might not grieve
Please show us a robin redbreasts egg said little Annie
Tom took two or three from under the bran and showed her the eggs
which were yellowishgray mottled with redbrown
Mrs Redbreast has not nearly so red a breast as Robin he said
I suppose you have plenty of sparrows eggs said Mary they are such
common birds
Yes here they are They are rather large for the size of the bird
they are spotted and streaked all over with gray and brown
What a lovely pale greenishblue egg that is exclaimed Mary
Yes that it is said Tom and it belongs to a dear little brown
birdthe hedgesparrow It is not at all the same kind of bird as the
housesparrow for it is one of the warblers It is a prettier bird and
has prettier eggs than the common sparrow He builds his nest very
early before the hedges are covered with leaves so his nest often gets
stolen He is one of the birds that stay in England all through the
winterThese speckled eggs of a bluishgray belong to the linnet
which has a very sweet song although not very powerfulThese belong
to the chaffinch they you see are greenishpurple spotted with
brown See here I have a nest made by this bird
It is perfectly lovely said Mary
It is indeed it is one of the most beautiful of all the birds
nestssuch a nice round shape and so firm that it does not easily fall
to pieces Inside it is lined with hair and feathers and downy things
which make it ever so soft Just put your finger inside Annie and feel
it Outside it is made of moss fine dry grass and wool all matted
together and covered all over with the lichen which grows on the trunks
and branches of trees It is often very difficult to find this birds
nest it looks so exactly like the part of a tree
Have you a blackbirds egg asked Jack I know his note for it is
clear and louder than that of most of the other birds
Yes here are some You see they are of a bluishgreen colour with
dark blotches and very pretty they are tooThose blue eggs with a few
black spots on them belong to the thrush You must have heard the
thrushes singing about grandpas garden there are plenty of them
there
Im afraid you havent a cuckoos egg Tom said Annie
I am so lucky as to have one Annie It is very small for the size of
the bird and not particularly pretty You see it is a dulllooking egg
whitish with palebrown markings This particular egg was taken from
the nest of a hedgesparrow but cuckoos eggs have been found in the
nests of many other birdsrobins and skylarks and chaffinchs
linnets blackbirds and wrens and many more besides
Why does not the cuckoo build a nest for herself asked Annie
Nobody seems to know why she doesnt but theres the fact When the
cuckoo has laid an egg she carries it in her wide gaping mouth and
puts it into the nest of another bird that she has chosen for it When
the egg is hatched the young cuckoo grows so fast that he wants all the
nest to himself He turns the other young birds that have been hatched
with him out of the nest and the true parents of these little birds
have to spend all their time in feeding the cuckoo It takes a great
deal to feed him because he grows so fast and is so much larger than
they are They dont seem to mind it thoughThose palegreen eggs with
darkbrown spots belonged to a rooks nest in the elmtree at the bottom
of the garden Theres a curious story about those rooks down there for
they have not been there long There is an old rookery belonging to the
Rectory close by our house and one day the rooks from there came to our
elmtree It was in the spring At last they came frequently and
chattered and cawed and flew round and round as if they did not know
what to do about building their nests in it Byandby their visits
ceased and they built their nests as usual in the Rectory trees That
very summer during one still night a large branch almost a third of
the elmtree fell to the ground The rooks seemed to know that the
tree was not safe and so they would not build in it That was two years
ago and this spring they have begun to build and there are several
nests now in our elmtree It is most interesting to watch the ways of
rooks they seem to have a lot of business on hand There is another
rookery in the town in the garden of Mrs Cross a friend of my
mothers Rooks always leave the town rookeries for the country as soon
as their young ones are able to fly Now Mrs Cross noticed that her
rooks after they had gone to the fields always came back each morning
quite early to look after their nests They stayed a little while to
talk over matters then they flew back again to the fields One very
stormy morning she noticed that instead of the whole flock coming and
alighting one solitary rook ventured through the wind and rain flying
round and round the trees without settling and then flew back again to
the others to give his report that all was right in the old home
What clever birds they must be said Mary
They are said Tom There are lots of stories about rooks but what I
have told you happened under our very eyesI have a sparrowhawks egg
here white spotted with brown It was given to my father by a man for
me There are not many of these birds about here
Oh said Jack I wish I could get a collection of birds eggs
It is almost too late in the season now said Tom Still you might
get some from late nests I can spare you some from mine to make a
beginning I know a young fellow who lives about a halfmile off who
has a large collection of eggs Well go and see him one Saturday
afternoon He is sure to have some to give away for he is always adding
to his store and he is very goodnatured
IV
JACK AND THE GARDENER
Oh fie upon you little birds
To eat up all our cherries
Why dont you go into the woods
And dine upon the berriesC H
A few days after Tom had shown his cousins his collection of birds
eggs Jack as he was coming away from a visit to Lion passed by the
end of the pottingshed The gardener was in there and he called out
Master Jack Ive got something for you in here
Jack went into the shed and the gardener fumbled about on a shelf till
he found what he was looking for
There he said is a thrushs nest I thought youd like it I took
it out of one of the trees in the orchard It has got four pretty eggs
in it
Illustration JACK AND THE THRUSHS NEST
Page 36
Oh said Jack how splendid What a treasure It does seem a shame
though to take it from the birds
His delight soon got the better of his scruples especially when he
heard the gardener say
There are too many birds about here already Missus does encourage them
so that they are as bold as possible I can tell you Master Jack who
gets most of the cherries It is not us that does its them birds
especially the thrushes and blackbirds Im up early and I see and I
hear em too before Im up There they are at the fruit as soon as tis
light They have their breakfasts hours before you get yours One
wouldnt grudge them a few cherries now and again but to clear the
trees as they do is downright greediness I say And I wouldnt be hard
on them for taking a few currants for we have plenty of them but they
just go and strip off the largest and reddest of them and leave the
stalk hanging and thats all thats left of a fine bunch Then as to
the peaseyou like pease dont you Master Jack your grandpas
uncommon fond of emwell I have to sow the pease pretty thick or
Ill warrant ye we shouldnt have a tidy row come up at all I have to
dodge about with netting and scarecrows to keep what we do get for I
hate a patchy row I do Last winter was a very cold season I dont
know how you found it in London Master Jack but here there was a long
hard frost for three weeks Wed had a good deal of rain then it turned
to snow and froze and snowed again till the snow lay pretty thick all
over the ground Then it cleared up and the sun shone but the sun
hasnt much power at that time of the year so it did not melt the snow
It was bitter cold by day and worse at night The birds that eat grubs
and insects could not get any food at all So your grandma had a big
lump of fat put into a piece of coarse netting and it was hung up in a
likely placethe long branch of a treewhere the birds could get well
at it You should have seen the poor creatures pecking away It was soon
gone and we had to put more lumps into the net before the frost went I
thought to myself it was almost a pity to try to save their lives it
was just a natural way of getting rid of a lot of them They do say that
dying by cold is an easy wayits like going to sleep so Im not
wishing any great harm to the little things And now Master Jack how
do you think these birds paid back your grandma for all her kindness
Why as soon as ever the frost was gone and the weather became warmer
and the yellow crocuses came into bloom if these very birds or some of
them at least did not slit the flowers all to pieces with their
billsthats what they did The ground was covered with bits of
flowersDo you know Mrs Jones who lives on the green Master Jack
No he said I dont
Well shes a great friend of your grandmas but she is not
overstrong and doesnt get out in the winter She likes to have the
birds about her and she fed them on her lawn with crumbs and pieces
and her fine bed of crocuses in front of her windows was just spoiled
It was mostly the yellow ones that they tore to shreds and the
primroses toothere was hardly one fit to pick The starlings and the
sparrows were the worst they did a lot of mischief
Oh said Jack perhaps they were after insects or something they
wanted to eat I dont believe they meant to do any harm
Perhaps not said the gardener but the crocuses were spoiled all the
same You know Master Jack Im about the place summer and winter and
I see a lot Now if theres one thing more than another that I hate
about a garden its cats They do trample down things and spoil the
beds As this house is lonesome rather we dont get much of that pest
Im glad to say and then Smut is not a sociable cat But Ill tell you
of a curious thing that happened to him one day There was a pair of
thrushes who had built their nest in the laurel hedge at the bottom of
the garden next to the field You know Master Jack theres a broad
gravel path along the garden side of the hedge One day just as the
young birds were able to get out of the nest the young cat at my
cottage close by walked into this garden where of course shed no
business but there she was in that gravel path and she saw one of the
birds and caught it I saw her with it The thrushes scolded her flew
at her with a sharp angry cry and puss was soon off the premises The
next day Mr Smut was walking along this gravel path enjoying the
sunshine in a quiet way never thinking of birds for hes a deal too
lazy to put himself out of the way to catch anything Ive tried him
with a mouse but he never put out a paw to touch it He blinked at it
in the most unconcerned way and didnt show the least bit of interest
in it Well as I said Smut was walking along when out flew the
thrushes from the hedge swooped down upon him pounced on his back
pecked his head and screeched at him till poor Smut was quite dazed
They fairly chased him out of that part of the garden You would have
laughed to have seen sober old Smut take to his legs as fast as he could
run The robins too soon afterwards began the same game and would
stand and scold within two or three yards of the cat if he was asleep
in the garden I have often seen them sit just over him and scold him
till he woke up and came indoors As to the gravel path by the thrushes
