A YANKEE FLIER OVER BERLIN
CHAPTER I
RUGGED GOING
The Commanding Colonel stared at the big map with its red ribbons
marking air trails to and from targets He was spotting the exact point
where his Third Fighter group would have to turn back and leave the big
Fortresses and Liberators to go it alone into the concentrated defenses
of Germany
Weather Officer Miller looked glumly at the map as Colonel Holt placed
his finger on a spot
610 cloud over station six Station six was a Luftwaffe fighter
field
The colonel scowled and shook his head Are the big boys going out
Yes sir Conditions over target are very good Weather grinned when
he said it
We wont get much of a whack at the Jerries the colonel said rather
testily
The Forts and Libs will make it through Weather said with a lot of
cockiness He was beginning to act like the rest of the gang around
headquarters who believed that the Forts and the Libs could go it alone
all the way and shoot down any number of fighters the Germans could send
up Colonel Holt was a strong supporter for fighter cover He was
battling for a flock of longerrange fighters that could accompany the
big fellows all the way to Berlin The way things were going he might
not be escorting at all within a few weeks His Third Fighter Command
might be on scouting duty
Well see what can be done about it he said as he turned away
The colonel walked out of the highceilinged room which was buried under
thirty feet of steel reinforced concrete He came up out of the building
into a drab night A raw wind stabbed at him and sent light clouds
scudding across the face of the moon Overhead a night fighter growled
its way through the lonely sky The country spread around the base was
flat with only a few hills to break the sameness
Out on the dispersal area Colonel Holt could see guards watching the
shadowy forms of the Thunderbolts A jeep came chugging up a muddy
street and turned off toward the mess barracks At onefive in the
morning the base looked peaceful enough Sheltered by darkness its mud
ruts and halffinished buildings were softened by the gloom Still
scowling the colonel strode away
Several hours later in a tunnelshaped hut with a corrugated iron roof
and a cement floor two fliers sat near a wood stove Stan Wilson was
poking wood into the stove
I wonder if anyone ever kept one of these gadgets burning all night
he said sourly
Sure an tis against the rules Lieutenant OMalley said and
grinned
Im beginning to think Allison showed good sense in running out on us
and joining a bomber outfit Stan growled Here we are sitting up all
night keeping this stove poked full of wood
That big bum OMalley snorted Only today he said that hes livin
in a palace with a sureenough butler to buttle OMalley shook his
head sadly The spalpeen says that butler can sure bake a foine pie
On top of that we get to fly Thunderbolts for the fun of it Stan
jabbed a slab of wood into the stove and slammed the door
Weve jest been havin bad luck OMalley said I can stand a Nissen
hut jest to be flyin one o them babies Well meet up with plenty o
Jerries OMalley grinned eagerly his homely face lighting up
Remember how we used to mix it with them Jerry bandits tryin to blitz
London
That was a long time ago as wars count time Stan answered Weve
been away a long time The Jerries dont get near London any more and I
heard a rumor that the Forts and Libs are able to shoot down ten
fighters for every one the Thunderbolts get
OMalley snorted Bombers shoot down Me 109s and FW 190s Tis jest
propaganda put out by the brass hats to fool the Germans Ill have to
see it done me by
From what I hear well probably have a reserved seat for the show We
sit up there and watch Stan smiled But we can always elbow in and
fly a Fortress or a Liberator
Not me OMalley declared Im no good at flying a milk wagon Ill
handle me own guns
Tomorrow will tell the tale Were to get our first whack at Jerry in
this new job Stan said
Sure an Id go to bed an forget it but the minnit I get me eyes
closed this stove goes out an Im freezin OMalley growled I dont
think well be goin any place Them brass hats meet at Operation
Headquarters an the generals call in Weather Weather squints out
through a porthole an says 610 cloud over target Then the generals
up an go back to bed
We sure miss a lot of missions because of bad weather Stan admitted
One of these days some fellow will invent a seeing eye sight that will
look right through the clouds
You been readin the funny books too much lately OMalley said
Missed any of yours Stan laughed as he glanced toward a pile of comic
books stacked beside OMalleys cot
I think our dog robbers been snitchin a few OMalley yawned and
stretched his arms over his head They were long bony arms with huge
hands attached to them
Werent you in Berlin before the war Stan asked
Sure OMalley answered Bein a son of good auld Ireland I was
itchin to get into a fight an it looked like the Jerries were the only
ones preparin to do anything
Why didnt you stay over there Stan grinned broadly as he spoke I
hear there are pretty girls in Berlin and that their mammas can bake
swell pies
OMalley sighed deeply at the mention of pie His big Adams apple
bobbed up and down then his wide mouth clamped shut
Sure an I dont like bein pushed around an I dont like to see
other folks kicked an slugged by a lot of spalpeens dressed up in brown
shirts
You may get to wave to that girl when we fly over Berlin Stan said
I could go straight to her house only she lives a ways out of Berlin
We used to go ridin in the country on our bikes Ivery lane wed ride
down some guy in a storm trooper uniform would stop us I kept pawin
out me Luftwaffe card all o the time OMalley grinned
So you got out and joined up with the British and then with us Stan
poked another stick of wood into the stove
OMalley yawned again and eyed his cot If you insist on keepin the
fire goin Ill catch me a couple o winks o sleep
Ill keep the joint warm Stan agreed
OMalley went over to his cot He kicked off his shoes and crawled under
the blankets fully dressed
The minutes dragged away and Stan nodded beside the stove An hour
passed and he roused himself to poke in more wood He dozed off again
and was roused by an orderly making the rounds calling the crews The
stove was cold and he fumbled with stiff fingers as he lighted it again
When it was cherry red in spots OMalley poked his tousled head out
from under a blanket Stan knew he had been lying there waiting for the
stove to get hot
They dashed water over their faces and hurried out into the raw morning
Stan glanced at his watch It was four oclock They walked to the
briefing room where they joined a crowd of pilots who were seated on
benches staring at a square of transparent talc pinned over a wall map
Red lines showed the route of the Forts and Libs Soon a sleepy buzz of
conversation filled the air As the pilots talked they watched the
little group of officers gathered before the map
Suddenly the Old Man Colonel Holt turned and faced them There was an
immediate hush
A lot of people think we just go along with the bombers to catch a bit
of fresh air and to keep from going stale This mission promised to be
our chance to crack the enemy but unfortunately Weather reports clouds
up to our return point The Old Man stared unwinkingly at his men He
read the disappointment in their faces We are hoping that for once
Weather will be wrong
This brought a few grins and a snort or two from the pilots The Old Man
went on talking
You are to fly formation as planned This will be strictly a team job
There will be no freelance hunting Understand
Everyone looked glum OMalley scowled It was not his nature to like
strict rules He had learned what he knew in the days of the Battle of
Britain and later in the South Pacific and then over Africa and Italy
OMalley always had been a riproaring fighter who accepted battle
against any odds If trouble did not come his way he went looking for
it
Stan wondered if that last warning was not aimed at OMalley and
himself All of the other fliers were trained to this sort of fighting
Stan and OMalley were the only old heads in the flight
OMalley and Stan marched out with the others and climbed into heavy
flying suits The Thunderbolts were high fliers and worked best at
twentythree thousand feet or more That meant heavy equipment with
oxygen and all of the other trappings including heated undergarments
The pilots waddled out to their planes and climbed up Ground crews
moved back They had serviced and checked the fighters and now their
Pratt and Whitney twin bank radial engines were turning over smoothly
Exhausts flared blue flames which sent wavering shadows across the wet
cement of the apron Flight Officer Mickle was running about like an old
hen with a scattered brood of chicks
Stan glanced down the wet and gleaming runway An Aldis lamp winked down
toward the shadow bar Stan eased himself back against the shock pad He
glanced at his temperature gauge and across his instrument board The
throb of his Pratt and Whitney engine hinted at power though it was
rolling over smoothly and effortlessly Stan remembered other nights
many months past when he had sat in a Hurricane waiting for the flash of
the lamp and the order from the tower to go up through the blind alley
between the barrage balloon cables to wage unequal war against invading
Germans Things had changed a lot since then Now he was a part of the
Eighth Air Force of the United States Army and was fighting for his own
country as well as Britain
Red Flight check your temperatures That was the voice of Flight
Leader Sim Jones
The boys checked in one at a time
Up to fifteen thousand Stay in close Sim ordered
Suddenly a motor burst into fullthroated roar A dark form hurtled down
the runway and lifted like a flash Another ship darted away and then
another Stan slammed his hatch cover shut and opened up his throttle
He jammed down hard on one brake and the Thunderbolt swept around She
poised an instant then knifed down the slippery runway Stan hoiked her
tail with a blast of prop pressure and hopped her off He went roaring
out over a mobile floodlight and up into the dark sky for the rendezvous
with Red Flight
High above the channel the ships of his flight tucked in and circled
Soon they picked up the flight of Liberators and Fortresses At
twentyfive thousand feet the big bombers left broad vapor trails behind
them Stan looked down upon the killers from his perch in the sky Dawn
was breaking and the scene was no longer drab
Red Flight was covering the flank of Second High Squadron Stan could
clearly see Third Low Squadron and First Lead Squadron Each squadron
was composed of a first flight of three bombers and a second flight of
three bombers Stan grinned He knew exactly where his pal March Allison
was flying He was in lefthand slot second flight Second High
Squadron the hottest spot in a bomber formation
Stan eased over a bit and shook OMalley off his wing Sim was waggling
his wings ordering the boys to spread out and get set for interception
Red Flight spread out but stayed in position like a football team moving
into formation for a screen pass The bombers roared on toward Germany
keeping tight formation so as to be able to lay out a deadly cross fire
from their fiftycaliber guns Each Fort and each Lib was a bristling
pillbox with nose guns waist guns belly guns and ball turret guns
Stan wondered if he would not be flying one of the big fellows very
soon
Everything went off smoothly and according to plan except that for once
Weather had missed a bet As the flight neared the point over Germany
where the Thunderbolts were to turn back a cold wind washed the sky
clear of clouds and a cold sun shone upon the raiders
In the good auld summertime Stan heard OMalley humming
Shut up OMalley Sim grated
Suddenly flak began to blossom out from the countryside below It
blossomed in the sky over the bombers and in the middle of Red Flight
Thunderbolts ducked and dipped but went roaring on
Down below the bomber boys were scanning the skies
In his Fort Allison drawled over the intercom Pilot to navigator
Go ahead pilot
Everybody set
Navigator to pilot hot stuff coming up
Right waist gunner to pilot sir 190s at eleven oclock Theyre
after the flight ahead
Rear gunner Roger sir Flock of FockeWulfs at six oclock Coming in
on our tail
I say old man dont get itchy fingers No ammo to waste Allisons
voice was calm and unruffled
OMalleys voice broke in over Stans headset Hey sure an we ought
to go down an bust that up
Stay where you are OMalley Sim snapped We have plenty of Mes
coming in at twelve oclock
Stan had been so busy watching the bombers he had not checked his own
part of the sky A glance showed him Sim was correct A flight of some
twenty Me fighters were diving and circling above
Keep them up there Sim ordered But stay in your slot You happen to
be outnumbered and you also happen to have the job of seeing that those
Mes stay up there away from the bombers
Red Flight knifed along through the thin air ready to smash any Me
daring to go down the chute upon the bombers
Come on down and fight ye spalpeens OMalley was yelling
Stan saw that the Forts and Libs were slamming lead at the FockeWulfs
in a blaze that rivaled a Fourth of July celebration He kept an eye on
Allisons Fort and saw an FW go down flaming after a thrust at the
bomber Stan chuckled softly
Allison got one OMalley yelled Tis a sad day this for Mrs
OMalleys son
Allisons Fort got another FW and OMalleys flow of abuse against the
Mes increased He was in a towering Irish rage But it did no good The
Mes hung on waiting for the Thunderbolts to turn back It was a case
of who ran short of gas first Now lacepanty flak was blossoming all
over the sky It exploded in pretty pink bursts and that was why the
boys gave it such a fancy name
We have to go in Sim ordered grimly
Go in OMalley bellowed Why not give them birds a scare anyway
Well zoom up and scatter them Sim said But any man who stays to
put on a show will have to walk back
Stan eased over and kicked on a bit more power The Germans had the
attack route well charted They knew just how far the Thunderbolts would
be able to penetrate With a burst of speed Stan went up and over Every
Thunderbolt did the same but OMalley beat them all to it He roared
over Stans head almost ripping away his hatch cover
The Mes ducked gracefully and scattered They looped and dived for it
Stan saw at once the chase was hopeless The Jerries meant to tease the
Thunderbolts deeper into Germany so that they would be sure to run out
of gas It was infuriating but there just was nothing that could be
done about it Stan watched OMalley as he roared after a Jerry
Come back Irisher Theyre just tricking you out of gas he called
The spalpeens OMalley roared but he zoomed up and over then tailed
in after Red Flight which was heading for home
Stan saw the Mes dive down to overtake and attack the Forts and Libs
He had a cold sick feeling in the pit of his stomach He still was not
convinced that the big fellows could take care of themselves They had a
hundred miles more to cover before reaching their targets and then
another hundred to return before fighters could meet them
Red Flight slid in on its home field a sleek flight group in fine trim
except for one slight wound Sims ship had picked up a small piece of
flak but it had done no damage Sim had it in his hand when he climbed
down and joined his men
A foine battle OMalley fumed
I was hit Sim said grinning
Tis the fillin out o one o yer teeth OMalley answered
I counted eight fighters shot down by the big boys a pilot remarked
Check in all kills you observed Sim said It will help the bomber
boys get credit
OMalley stared gloomily up into the sky Stan nudged him How about
some breakfast he asked
OMalley brightened a bit I ordered a pie for breakfast he said If
that cook forgot my pie hell be no more than a grease spot when I get
through with him
OMalley got his pie a thick apple pie dripping with juice He cut it
into quarters slid one slab out on his fist and began munching paying
no attention to the dripping juice Stan stared into his coffee cup He
was thinking
OMalley finished his second quarter of pie He looked at Stan
What you dreamin up now he asked
Stan smiled faintly You know I have a hunch we might fool those
Jerries They have this all down to a science A flight is reported to
their head man and he figures out just how far we can fly If we could
do say a hundred miles more wed have some fun
So youre goin to order planes with a hundred more miles gas supply
OMalley grunted and attacked his third piece of pie
We could take along emergency tanks and drop them Stan said
OMalley halted the movement of his hand His mouth was open like a
cavern He closed it
Sure an tis a brilliant idea Well see the general about it as soon
as Ive finished me pie
No well see Holt Hes our superior officer Let him have the
credit Stan leaned back
If we tell a lot o brass hats the Jerries will sure hear about it
OMalley said sourly
I think not We have to get permission to install the tanks you know
This isnt the South Pacific where you just go to your ground crew and
ask them to rig up something for you Stan laughed as OMalley screwed
his face into a frown
Ill say its not the South Pacific he agreed We got so many rules
here a fellow gets tangled up before he takes off
We have lots of time on our hands Well barge over and have Allison
tell us what happened Hell be back after a bit
OMalley gave Stan a suspicious look Youre not thinkin o askin fer
one o them crates full o guns
No Stan answered If I did I doubt that theyd take me Ive been a
fighter pilot too long
They took Allison OMalley said
Allison is a natural for bombers he has no nerves and he can handle a
crew Stan got to his feet Finish your pie and well be on our way
CHAPTER II
ACTION
Stan and OMalley found Allison in his comfortable quarters an old
English mansion set on a little hill It stood in the middle of
wellkept grounds As they drove up in their borrowed jeep OMalley
scowled at the house
A blinking castle he said in mock cockney British
They parked the jeep and went inside The boys were gathered around an
open fire lounging in easy chairs Allison moved out of a huddle and
crossed the room
Welcome you wallflowers he said with a big smile
Sure an yer a disgrace to the both of us lollin in the lap o
luxury OMalley answered with a big grin
How was it Stan asked
Very rugged Allison admitted Sit down while I order a pie for
OMalley
The boys seated themselves and Allison described the mission He loaded
his pipe and sat staring into the fire
Not much like pushing a Spitfire or a Thunderbolt You just plow along
through the muck and hope the boys will bat down all of the fighters
coming at you from every angle
How many did you get OMalley asked
Six for sure Allison answered The real fun started when we headed
for home We had been plowing through flak as thick as a swarm of bees
but we had been lucky Two of our flight went down flaming and we saw
the boys bail out I thought we were slipping through pretty nicely when
an Me winged us with an explosive cannon shell After that we got hit
plenty We picked up a shell which went off inside our outboard engine
It started rolling smoke but no flames Then a shell smashed the
intercom system and communications went dead Allison bit down hard on
his pipe
Must have been tough Stan said
We couldnt hold our altitude We lost about a thousand feet a minute
and nothing the copilot and I could do would hold her up
Sure an you did a good job of it gettin in OMalley praised
When I couldnt talk to the crew I turned the controls over to the
copilot and went aft I got to the top turret man and told him to get
the gunners together in the radio compartment I figured wed smack
right down into the channel Allison fingered his pipe and stared into
the fire
I went back to the copilot and we fought her head She sagged in over
the coast and came right on home smoking like a torch As we came in
we found we had a belly landing on our hands so we skidded her in Poor
Old Sal is a mess right now
Anybody hurt Stan asked
Bombardier got a piece of flak in his leg The tail gunner had his
greenhouse blown into his face and is in the hospital I forgot to say
we dumped our guns and everything else we could pry loose I guess that
saved us Allison leaned back When you fellows going to shift over
This is the real thing
Sitting duck stuff OMalley snorted You jest sit there an take it
You never fired a gun on the whole trip
No Allison admitted But we bagged six Jerries and there was plenty
of shooting You should see my boys work those 50s
We aim to stir up a bit of excitement Stan said
Allison frowned at him You birds better remember this is modern
warfare not the Battle of Britain or the Pacific Theyll bounce you
high and quick for breaking rules This Eighth Air Force is big stuff
now
Thanks for the warning Stan answered But we plan to go through
proper channels
And its a deep secret OMalley added
OMalleys pie arrived and he dropped out of the talk for a time Stan
and Allison chatted about the changes and the amazing way the Eighth had
grown up until it took a large section of British farmland to house it
Stan and OMalley left early and hurried back to their own mess They
wanted to corner Colonel Holt They found him in the mess looking very
dour and gloomy He was alone None of the other men seemed to care
about trying to cheer him up Stan and OMalley barged over to his
table
May we sit down sir Stan asked
Sure Holt motioned to two chairs
The boys sat down Stan ordered coffee and OMalley ordered pie
I need just a bite to get me in shape for supper he said when Stan
glared at him as he gave his order
Lousy show today Holt grumbled I dont mean the way you fellows
flew it but the way the Germans have everything figured out so neatly
We lost eleven bombers
We might fool Jerry Stan suggested
How
Suppose we just toted along some extra tanks of gas and cut them loose
about the time the show should start We know their tactics and pattern
Wed have a lot of fun Stan leaned forward
Cant do that Holt said You fellows might have to get busy as soon
as you hit the coast Kicking off a tank cant be done with an FW
dropping out of a cloud on your tail
Just half of us will go with extra loads The others can cover for us
Wed sure surprise Jerry Stan spoke eagerly
Foine idea an one Id have been proud to have thought up OMalley
broke in
Colonel Holt began to smile I believe you have something there The
element of surprise and all that sort of thing Well take a crack at
it
Elegant OMalley said Im speaking for extra gas
You and OMalley get extra tanks Youre both old heads at lone wolf
tactics Im beginning to think we have too much handling out of the
control room He bent forward and his smile faded But remember this
Im under a general whos a stickler for the book so be careful
We wont let you down sir Stan promised
OMalley just grinned wolfishly I got a date with that Jerry with the
red beard
You boys tend to the installing yourselves Oversee it yourselves Ill
put through an order clearing everything for you
Thanks Colonel Stan said Now well run along and get busy
First you come with me and well figure out how much tank capacity
youll need and how many men will go along The colonel got to his
feet
If you dont mind sir wed like to have you sponsor the idea We
intended to take it up with Lieutenant Sim Jones first Wouldnt want to
be going over his head Stan spoke quickly
Holt looked at him and nodded Thats fine of you boys Mind if I claim
the idea for the present
Not in the least Stan answered
In that case youll hear from me later through regular channels I see
you men know your way around in this army
Stan and OMalley saluted and moved off OMalley grinned Slick work
Stan he said Now we wont get blamed for anything
And we wont get a medal either Stan remarked as he matched
OMalleys grin
Returning to their Nissen hut the boys policed their living quarters and
got things in order The hut was such a primitive affair that little
could be done to keep it in order The round wood stove leaked ashes on
the floor which was always tracked deep with mud There was a little
wash bowl and a table which OMalley used to stack his laundry upon The
cots were GI with GI mattresses
After they had cleaned up the boys went over to the huge sheds where
the mechanics worked over the planes They learned from the chief
mechanic that Colonel Holts order had come through
I have the boys on your ships the sergeant said He did not seem to
approve of the idea
Ill be after lookin out fer me own ship OMalley said and hurried
away
You dont seem to like the colonels idea Stan said
Weve tried it before sir the sergeant replied
What happened
The boys got jumped out of cloud cover and were sitting ducks for the
Jerries the sergeant said sourly Too much cloud cover and too many
Jerries for that stuff
Stan grinned Ill drop around and let you know how it works this
time
Walking back to his ship he watched the boys working on her He was soon
satisfied that they knew just what should be done and made off OMalley
did not show up at mess and Stan began to wonder where he had gone He
finally sauntered into the rest room where he found OMalley shooting
the breeze with a group of fliers
You missed a steak dinner Stan greeted him
OMalley grinned Thats what you think he said I had me a steak
dinner with the corporal that fixed up me ship You know that feller
hadnt had a steak for a month He sure went for it OMalley seated
himself and elevated his feet to the top of the radio In this position
he promptly went to sleep
Stan talked with the boys until time to turn in He wakened OMalley and
they sloshed through the mud to their hut During their absence two
other boys replacement men had been quartered in the hut They greeted
the two old heads eagerly
They were Bugs Monahan and Splinters Wright both from Toledo Ohio
They had just finished flight combat school and were eager for action
Someone had given them the records of Stan and OMalley They were both
eager to talk to the veterans Splinters was a tall thin youth with a
little mustache Bugs was short and fat with a round beaming face and a
quick smile
Weve heard a lot about you fellows Bugs said
Never believe anything you hear in the army Stan advised with a grin
Sure an yeve been taken in by me auld pal Goebbels OMalley added
Im turning in Well get a call along about four in the morning
Stan said See you boys over at the rest room Thats where we shoot
the breeze
See you at midnight when we get up to poke wood into that stove
OMalley contradicted
Well keep the fire going Were not sleepy Splinters said They were
both disappointed that the old heads did not want to go into a gabfest
Stan and OMalley turned in They had learned to get as much sleep as
possible The two replacements kept the fire going as they had promised
and the boys did not waken until they were called at threefifty the
