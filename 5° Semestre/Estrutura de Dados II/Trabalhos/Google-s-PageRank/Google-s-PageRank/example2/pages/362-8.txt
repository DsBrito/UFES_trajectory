I admit however I would like to know his name To find out what that
mysterious M J stands for has got to be pretty nearly an obsession
with me I am about ready to pick his pocket or rifle his trunk in
search of some lurking Martin or John that will set me at peace As
it is I confess that I have ogled his incoming mail and his outgoing
baggage shamelessly only to be slapped in the face always and
everlastingly by that bland M J Ive got my revenge now though To
myself I call him Mary Janeand his broadshouldered brownbearded
six feet of muscular manhood would so like to be called Mary Jane
By the way Belle if you ever hear of murder and sudden death in my
direction better set the sleuths on the trail of Arkwright Six to one
youll find I called him Mary Jane to his face
Calderwell was thinking of that letter now as he sat at a small table
in a Paris cafe Opposite him was the six feet of muscular manhood
broad shoulders pointed brown beard and alland he had just addressed
it inadvertently as Mary Jane
During the brief sickening moment of silence after the name had left
his lips Calderwell was conscious of a whimsical realization of the
lights music and laughter all about him
Well I chose as safe a place as I could he was thinking Then
Arkwright spoke
How long since youve been in correspondence with members of my
family
Eh
Arkwright laughed grimly
Perhaps you thought of it yourself thenIll admit youre capable of
it he nodded reaching for a cigar But it so happens you hit upon my
familys favorite name for me
Mary Jane You mean they actually call you that
Yes bowed the big fellow calmly as he struck a light
Appropriatedont you think
Calderwell did not answer He thought he could not
Well silence gives consent they say laughed the other Anyhow you
must have had some reason for calling me that
Arkwright what does M J stand for demanded Calderwell
Oh is that it smiled the man opposite Well Ill own those
initials have been something of a puzzle to people One man declares
theyre Merely Jokes but another not so friendly says they stand
for Mostly Jealousy of more fortunate chaps who have real names for
a handle My small brothers and sisters discovering with the usual
perspicacity of ones family on such matters that I never signed or
called myself anything but M J dubbed me Mary Jane And there you
have it
Mary Jane You
Arkwright smiled oddly
Oh well whats the difference Would you deprive them of their
innocent amusement And they do so love that Mary Jane Besides
whats in a name anyway he went on eyeing the glowing tip of the
cigar between his fingers A rose by any other nameyouve
heard that probably Names dont always signify my dear fellow For
instance I know a Billybut hes a girl
Calderwell gave a sudden start
You dont mean BillyNeilson
The other turned sharply
Do you know Billy Neilson
Calderwell gave his friend a glance from scornful eyes
Do I know Billy Neilson he cried Does a fellow usually know the
girl hes proposed to regularly once in three months Oh I know Im
telling tales out of school of course he went on in response to the
look that had come into the brown eyes opposite But whats the use
Everybody knows itthat knows us Billy herself got so she took it as
a matter of courseand refused as a matter of course too just as she
would refuse a serving of apple pie at dinner if she hadnt wanted it
Apple pie scouted Arkwright
Calderwell shrugged his shoulders
My dear fellow you dont seem to realize it but for the last six
months you have been assisting at the obsequies of a dead romance
Indeed And is itburied yet
Oh no sighed Calderwell cheerfully I shall go back one of these
days Ill warrant and begin the same old game again though I will
acknowledge that the last refusal was so very decided that its been a
year almost since I received it I think I was really convinced for
a while thatthat she didnt want that apple pie he finished with
a whimsical lightness that did not quite coincide with the stern lines
that had come to his mouth
For a moment there was silence then Calderwell spoke again
Where did you knowMiss Billy
Oh I dont know her at all I know of herthrough Aunt Hannah
Calderwell sat suddenly erect
Aunt Hannah Is she your aunt too Jove This is a little old world
after all isnt it
She isnt my aunt Shes my mothers third cousin None of us have seen
her for years but she writes to mother occasionally and of course
for some time now her letters have been running over full of Billy She
lives with her I believe doesnt she
She does rejoined Calderwell with an unexpected chuckle I wonder
if you know how she happened to live with her at first
Why no I reckon not What do you mean
Calderwell chuckled again
Well Ill tell you You being a Mary Jane ought to appreciate it
You see Billy was named for one William Henshaw her fathers chum
who promptly forgot all about her At eighteen Billy being left quite
alone in the world wrote to Uncle William and asked to come and live
with him
Well
But it wasnt well William was a fortyyearold widower who lived with
two younger brothers an old butler and a Chinese cook in one of those
funny old Beacon Street houses in Boston The Strata Bertram called
it Bright boyBertram
The Strata
Yes I wish you could see that house Arkwright Its a regular layer
cake Cyrilhes the second brother must be thirtyfour or five
nowlives on the top floor in a rugless curtainless musicmad
existencejust a plain crank Below him comes William William collects
thingseverything from tenpenny nails to teapots I should say and
theyre all there in his rooms Farther down somewhere comes Bertram
Hes the Bertram Henshaw you understand the artist
Not the FaceofaGirl Henshaw
The same only of course four years ago he wasnt quite so well known
as he is now Well to resume and go on It was into this house this
masculine paradise ruled over by Pete and Dong Ling in the kitchen that
Billys naive request for a home came
Great Scott breathed Arkwright appreciatively
Yes Well the letter was signed Billy They took her for a boy
naturally and after something of a struggle they agreed to let him
come For his particular delectation they fixed up a room next to
Bertram with guns and fishing rods and such ladylike specialties and
William went to the station to meet the boy
With never a suspicion
With never a suspicion
Gorry
Well he came and she conquered I guess things were lively for
a while though Oh there was a kitten too I believe Spunk who
added to the gayety of nations
But what did the Henshaws do
Well I wasnt there of course but Bertram says they spun around like
tops gone mad for a time but finally quieted down enough to summon a
married sister for immediate propriety and to establish Aunt Hannah for
permanency the next day
So thats how it happened Well by George cried Arkwright
Yes nodded the other So you see there are untold possibilities just
in a name Remember that Just suppose you as Mary Jane should beg a
home in a feminine householdsay in Miss Billys for instance
Id like to retorted Arkwright with sudden warmth
Calderwell stared a little
The other laughed shamefacedly
Oh its only that I happen to have a devouring curiosity to meet
that special young lady I sing her songs you know shes written some
dandies Ive heard a lot about her and Ive seen her picture
He did not add that he had also purloined that same picture from his
mothers bureauthe picture being a gift from Aunt Hannah So you
see I would indeed like to occupy a corner in the fair Miss Billys
household I could write to Aunt Hannah and beg a home with her you
know eh
Of course Why dont youMary Jane laughed Calderwell Billyd
take you all right Shes had a little Miss Hawthorn a music teacher
there for months Shes always doing stunts of that sort Belle writes
me that shes had a dozen forlornites there all this last summer two
or three at a timetired widows lonesome old maids and crippled
kidsjust to give them a royal good time So you see shed take you
without a doubt Jove what a pair youd make Miss Billy and Mr Mary
Jane Youd drive the suffragettes into conniption fitsjust by the
sound of you
Arkwright laughed quietly then he frowned
But how about it he asked I thought she was keeping house with Aunt
Hannah Didnt she stay at all with the Henshaws
Oh yes a few months I never knew just why she did leave but I
fancied from something Billy herself said once that she discovered she
was creating rather too much of an upheaval in the Strata So she took
herself off She went to school and travelled considerably She was
over here when I met her first After that she was with us all one
summer on the yacht A couple of years ago or so she went back to
Boston bought a house and settled down with Aunt Hannah
And shes not marriedor even engaged
Wasnt the last I heard I havent seen her since December and Ive
heard from her only indirectly She corresponds with my sister and so
do Iintermittently I heard a month ago from Belle and she had a
letter from Billy in August But I heard nothing of any engagement
How about the Henshaws I should think there might be a chance there
for a romancea charming girl and three unattached men
Calderwell gave a slow shake of the head
I dont think so William islet me seenearly fortyfive I guess
by this time and he isnt a marrying man He buried his heart with his
wife and baby years ago Cyril according to Bertram hates women
and all other confusion so that ought to let him out As for Bertram
himselfBertram is only Bertram Hes always been that Bertram loves
girlsto paint but I cant imagine him making serious love to any one
It would always be the tilt of a chin or the turn of a cheek that he was
admiringto paint No theres no chance for a romance there Ill
warrant
But theresyourself
Calderwells eyebrows rose the fraction of an inch
Oh of course I presume January or February will find me back there
he admitted with a sigh and a shrug Then a little bitterly he added
No Arkwright I shall keep away if I can I know theres no chance
for menow
Then youll leave me a clear field bantered the other
Of courseMary Jane retorted Calderwell with equal lightness
Thank you
Oh you neednt laughed Calderwell My giving you the right of way
doesnt insure you a thoroughfare for yourselfthere are others you
know Billy Neilson has had sighing swains about I her I imagine since
she could walk and talk She is a wonderfully fascinating little bit of
femininity and she has a heart of pure gold All is I envy the man who
wins itfor the man who wins that wins her
There was no answer Arkwright sat with his eyes on the moving throng
outside the window near them Perhaps he had not heard At all events
when he spoke some time later it was of a matter far removed from Miss
Billy Neilson or the way to her heart Nor was the young lady mentioned
between them again that day
Long hours later just before parting for the night Arkwright said
Calderwell Im sorry but I believe after all I cant take that trip
to the lakes with you IIm going home next week
Home Hang it Arkwright Id counted on you Isnt this rather
sudden
Yes and no Ill own Ive been drifting about with you contentedly
enough for the last six months to make you think mountainclimbing and
boatpaddling were the end and aim of my existence But they arent you
know really
Nonsense At heart youre as much of a vagabond as I am and you know
it
Perhaps But unfortunately I dont happen to carry your pocketbook
You may if you like Ill hand it over any time grinned Calderwell
Thanks You know well enough what I mean shrugged the other
There was a moments silence then Calderwell queried
Arkwright how old are you
Twentyfour
Good Then youre merely travelling to supplement your education see
Oh yes I see But something besides my education has got to be
supplemented now I reckon
What are you going to do
There was an almost imperceptible hesitation then a little shortly
came the answer
Hit the trail for Grand Opera and bring up probablyin vaudeville
Calderwell smiled appreciatively
You can sing like the devil he admitted
Thanks returned his friend with uplifted eyebrows Do you mind
calling it an angeljust for this occasion
Oh the matineegirls will do that fast enough But I say
Arkwright what are you going to do with those initials then
Let em alone
Oh no you wont And you wont be Mary Jane either Imagine a Mary
Jane in Grand Opera I know what youll be Youll be Senor Martini
Johnini Arkwrightino By the way you didnt say what that M J
really did stand for hinted Calderwell shamelessly
Merely Jokesin your estimation evidently shrugged the other
But my going isnt a joke Calderwell Im really going And Im going
to work
Buthow shall you manage
Time will tell
Calderwell frowned and stirred restlessly in his chair
But honestly now toto follow that trail of yours will take
money Ander a faint red stole to his foreheaddont they
haveerpatrons for these young and budding geniuses Why cant I have
a hand in this trail tooor maybe youd call it a foot eh Id be no
end glad to Arkwright
Thanks old man The red was duplicated this time above the brown
silky beard That was mighty kind of you and I appreciate it but it
wont be necessary A generous but perhaps misguided bachelor uncle
left me a few thousands a year or so ago and Im going to put them all
down my throator rather into itbefore I give up
Where you going to study New York
Again there was an almost imperceptible hesitation before the answer
came
Im not quite prepared to say
Why not try it here
Arkwright shook his head
I did plan to when I came over but Ive changed my mind I believe Id
rather work while longer in America
Hmm murmured Calderwell
There was a brief silence followed by other questions and other
answers after which the friends said good night
In his own room as he was dropping off to sleep Calderwell muttered
drowsily
By George I havent found out yet what that blamed M J stands
for
CHAPTER II AUNT HANNAH GETS A LETTER
In the cozy livingroom at Hillside Billy Neilsons pretty home on
Corey Hill Billy herself sat writing at the desk Her pen had just
traced the date October twentyfifth when Mrs Stetson entered with
a letter in her hand
Writing my dear Then dont let me disturb you She turned as if to
go
Billy dropped her pen sprang to her feet flew to the little womans
side and whirled her half across the room
There she exclaimed as she plumped the breathless and scandalized
Aunt Hannah into the biggest easy chair I feel better I just had to
let off steam some way Its so lovely you came in just when you did
Indeed IIm not so sure of that stammered the lady dropping the
letter into her lap and patting with agitated fingers her cap her
curls the two shawls about her shoulders and the lace at her throat
My grief and conscience Billy Worst you ever grow up
Hope not purred Billy cheerfully dropping herself on to a low
hassock at Aunt Hannahs feet
But my dear youyoure engaged
Billy bubbled into a chuckling laugh
As if I didnt know that when Ive just written a dozen notes to
announce it And oh Aunt Hannah such a time as Ive had telling what
a dear Bertram is and how I love love love him and what beautiful
eyes he has and such a nose and
Billy Aunt Hannah was sitting erect in pale horror
Eh Billys eyes were roguish
You didnt write that in those notes
Write it Oh no Thats only what I wanted to write chuckled
Billy What I really did write was as staid and proper ashere let me
show you she broke off springing to her feet and running over to her
desk There this is about what I wrote to them all she finished
whipping a note out of one of the unsealed envelopes on the desk and
spreading it open before Aunt Hannahs suspicious eyes
Hmm that is very goodfor you admitted the lady
Well I like thatafter all my stern selfcontrol and selfsacrifice
to keep out all those things I wanted to write bridled Billy
Besides theyd have been ever so much more interesting reading than
these will be she pouted as she took the note from her companions
hand
I dont doubt it observed Aunt Hannah dryly
Billy laughed and tossed the note back on the desk
Im writing to Belle Calderwell now she announced musingly dropping
herself again on the hassock I suppose shell tell Hugh
Poor boy Hell be disappointed
Billy sighed but she uptilted her chin a little
He ought not to be I told him long long ago the very first time
thatthat I couldnt
I know dear butthey dont always understand Aunt Hannah sighed
in sympathy with the faraway Hugh Calderwell as she looked down at the
bright young face near her
There was a moments silence then Billy gave a little laugh
He will be surprised she said He told me once that Bertram
wouldnt ever care for any girl except to paint To paint indeed As
if Bertram didnt love mejust meif he never saw another tube of
paint
I think he does my dear
Again there was silence then from Billys lips there came softly
Just think weve been engaged almost four weeksand tomorrow itll
be announced Im so glad I didnt ever announce the other two
The other two cried Aunt Hannah
Billy laughed
Oh I forgot You didnt know about Cyril
Cyril
Oh there didnt anybody know it either not even Cyril himself
dimpled Billy mischievously I just engaged myself to him in
imagination you know to see how Id like it I didnt like it But
it didnt last anyhow very longjust three weeks I believe Then I
broke it off she finished with unsmiling mouth but dancing eyes
Billy protested Aunt Hannah feebly
But I am glad only the family knew about my engagement to Uncle
Williamoh Aunt Hannah you dont know how good it does seem to call
him Uncle again It was always slipping out anyhow all the time we
were engaged and of course it was awful then
That only goes to prove my dear how entirely unsuitable it was from
the start
A bright color flooded Billys face
I know but if a girl will think a man is asking for a wife when all
he wants is a daughter and if she blandly says Yes thank you Ill
marry you I dont know what you can expect
You can expect just what you gotmisery and almost a tragedy
retorted Aunt Hannah severely
A tender light came into Billys eyes
Dear Uncle William What a jewel he was all the way through And hed
have marched straight to the altar too with never a flicker of an
eyelid I knowselfsacrificing martyr that he was
Martyr bristled Aunt Hannah with extraordinary violence for her
Im thinking that term belonged somewhere else A month ago Billy
Neilson you did not look as if youd live out half your days But I
suppose youd have gone to the altar too with never a flicker of an
eyelid
But I thought I had to protested Billy I couldnt grieve Uncle
William so after Mrs Hartwell had said how hehe wanted me
Aunt Hannahs lips grew stern at the corners
There are times whenwhen I think it would be wiser if Mrs Kate
Hartwell would attend to her own affairs Aunt Hannahs voice fairly
shook with wrath
WhyAunt Hannah reproved Billy in mischievous horror Im shocked at
you
Aunt Hannah flushed miserably
There there child forget I said it I ought not to have said it of
course she murmured agitatedly
Billy laughed
You should have heard what Uncle William said But never mind We all
found out the mistake before it was too late and everything is lovely
now even to Cyril and Marie Did you ever see anything so beatifically
happy as that couple are Bertram says he hasnt heard a dirge from
Cyrils rooms for three weeks and that if anybody else played the kind
of music hes been playing it would be just common garden ragtime
Music Oh my grief and conscience That makes me think Billy If Im
not actually forgetting what I came in here for cried Aunt Hannah
fumbling in the folds of her dress for the letter that had slipped from
her lap Ive had word from a young niece Shes going to study music
in Boston
A niece
Well not really you know She calls me Aunt just as you and the
Henshaw boys do But I really am related to her for her mother and I
are third cousins while it was my husband who was distantly related to
the Henshaw family
Whats her name
Mary Jane Arkwright Where is that letter
Here it is on the floor reported Billy Were you going to read it
to me she asked as she picked it up
Yesif you dont mind
Id love to hear it
Then Ill read it Itit rather annoys me in some ways I thought the
whole family understood that I wasnt living by myself any longerthat
I was living with you Im sure I thought I wrote them that long ago
But this sounds almost as if they didnt understand itat least as if
this girl didnt
How old is she
I dont know but she must be some old to be coming here to Boston to
study music alonesinging I think she said
You dont remember her then
Aunt Hannah frowned and paused the letter half withdrawn from its
envelope
Nobut that isnt strange They live West I havent seen any of them
for years I know there are several childrenand I suppose Ive been
told their names I know theres a boythe eldest I thinkwho is
quite a singer and theres a girl who paints I believe but I dont
seem to remember a Mary Jane
Never mind Suppose we let Mary Jane speak for herself suggested
Billy dropping her chin into the small pink cup of her hand and
settling herself to listen
Very well sighed Aunt Hannah and she opened the letter and began to
read
DEAR AUNT HANNAHThis is to tell you
that Im coming to Boston to study singing in
the school for Grand Opera and Im planning to
look you up Do you object I said to a friend
the other day that Id half a mind to write to Aunt
Hannah and beg a home with her and my friend
retorted Why dont you Mary Jane But
that of course I should not think of doing
But I know I shall be lonesome Aunt Hannah
and I hope youll let me see you once in a
while anyway I plan now to come next week
Ive already got as far as New York as you see
by the addressand I shall hope to see you
soon
All the family would send love I know
M J ARKWRIGHT
Grand Opera Oh how perfectly lovely cried Billy
Yes but Billy do you think she is expecting me to invite her to make
her home with me I shall have to write and explain that I cantif she
does of course
Billy frowned and hesitated
Why it soundeda littlethat way but Suddenly her face cleared
Aunt Hannah Ive thought of the very thing We will take her
Oh Billy I couldnt think of letting you do that demurred Aunt
Hannah Youre very kindbut oh no not that
Why not I think it would be lovely and we can just as well as not
After Marie is married in December she can have that room Until then
she can have the little blue room next to me
Butbutwe dont know anything about her
We know shes your niece and shes lonesome and we know shes
musical I shall love her for every one of those things Of course well
take her
ButI dont know anything about her age
All the more reason why she should be looked out for then retorted
Billy promptly Why Aunt Hannah just as if you didnt want to give
this lonesome unprotected young girl a home
Oh I do of course but
Then its all settled interposed Billy springing to her feet
But what if wewe shouldnt like her
Nonsense What if she shouldnt like us laughed Billy However if
youd feel better just ask her to come and stay with us a month We
shall keep her all right afterwards See if we dont
Slowly Aunt Hannah got to her feet
Very well dear Ill write of course as you tell me to and its
lovely of you to do it Now Ill leave you to your letters Ive
hindered you far too long as it is
Youve rested me declared Billy flinging wide her arms
Aunt Hannah fearing a second dizzying whirl impelled by those same
young arms drew her shawls about her shoulders and backed hastily
toward the hall door
Billy laughed
Oh I wont againtoday she promised merrily Then as the lady
reached the arched doorway Tell Mary Jane to let us know the day
and train and well meet her Oh and Aunt Hannah tell her to wear a
pinka white pink and tell her we will too she finished gayly
CHAPTER III BILLY AND BERTRAM
Bertram called that evening Before the open fire in the livingroom he
found a pensive Billy awaiting hima Billy who let herself be kissed
it is true and who even kissed back shyly adorably but a Billy who
looked at him with wide almost frightened eyes
Why darling whats the matter he demanded his own eyes growing
wide and frightened
Bertram itsdone
Whats done What do you mean
Our engagement Itsannounced I wrote stacks of notes today
and even now there are some left for tomorrow And then theresthe
newspapers Bertram right away now everybody will know it Her
voice was tragic
Bertram relaxed visibly A tender light came to his eyes
Well didnt you expect everybody would know it my dear
Yyes but
At her hesitation the tender light changed to a quick fear
Billy you arentsorry
The pink glory that suffused her face answered him before her words did
Sorry Oh never Bertram Its only that it wont be ours any
longerthat is it wont belong to just our two selves Everybody will
know it And theyll bow and smile and say How lovely to our faces
and Did you ever to our backs Oh no Im not sorry Bertram but I
amafraid
AfraidBilly
Yes
Billy sighed and gazed with pensive eyes into the fire
Across Bertrams face swept surprise consternation and dismay Bertram
had thought he knew Billy in all her moods and fancies but he did not
know her in this one
Why Billy he breathed
Billy drew another sigh It seemed to come from the very bottoms of her
small satinslippered feet
Well I am Youre the Bertram Henshaw You know lots and lots of
