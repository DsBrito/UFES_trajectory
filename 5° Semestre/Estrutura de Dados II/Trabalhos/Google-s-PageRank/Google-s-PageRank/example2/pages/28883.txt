stern tube And theres one of those guards I dont like the looks of
Nonsense The kmetal people know their men they picked these three
especially for the job
Who else could do it Theres only the five of us on board
There might be something in what Tommy said at that A thing like this
couldnt just happen by itself And come to think of it one of those
guards was a queer looking bird dwarfed and hunchbacked sort of and
with long dangling arms It would be better to investigate
Get em up here Tommy Blaine said
The RX8 drove on and on through the uncharted wastes outside the orbit
of Mars None of the space ships of the inner planets ever ventured out
this far and Blaine knew there was grave danger of colliding with some
of the small bodies with which the zone was infested If one of those
guards was the traitor he was risking his own neck as well as theirs
Two of them entered the control room with Tom Farley big husky
fellows of stolid countenance and armed with regulation flameray
pistols and gas grenades
Wheres the other the dwarf Blaine asked his suspicions mounting
immediately
In his bunk Tom replied with a meaning look He said hed be up in
a few minutes
The pilotcommander addressed the guards Fellows he said I
suppose you know were in a serious fix The ship is out of control and
weve missed Mars where your metal was to be delivered Were speeding
out into the unknown out past the limits of spacetravel toward the
orbits of Jupiter Saturn UranusGod knows where And my engineer
thinks that one of your number has tampered with the machinery Know
anything about it Blaine eyed them keenly
One of the guards Mahoney flushed hotly No sir he snapped At
least Kelly and meself had nothin to do with it But weve been
suspicionin that little Antazzo ever since we came out Its a
peculiar way he has about him the divil
You think he
An incisive voice from the doorway way interrupted Never mind what he
thinks Carson Ill do the thinking from now on
At one man they turned to face the speaker It was the guard Antazzo
and he was clothed from neck to ankles in a garment of bright metallic
stuff that shimmered with shifting colors like those of a soap bubble
A mask of similar stuff covered his face and in each hand there was a
weapon resembling a ray pistol but of strangely unfamiliar design
Mahoney shot from the hip and his stabbing ray splashed full on the
hunchbacks chestbut harmlessly That lustrous garment was an
insulating armor the traitorous guard should have been shriveled to a
cinder at the contact Antazzo laughed evilly as his own weapons loosed
strange and terrible energies
Tom Farley ducked and Blaine watched in horrified amazement as the
crackling streamers of blue radiance from the dwarfs pistols found
their marks Mahoney and Kelly standing there bathed for a brief
instant in horrid blue fire tottering swaying their mouths opened
wide in a last agonized effort to cry out Tiny pinpoints of brilliant
pyrotechnics flashing and exploding within the columns of blue fire
Then nothing Where the two husky guards had stood there was utter
emptiness not even a shred of clothing remained The air in the
control room became heavy and acrid
Antazzo Whitefaced and shaking Blaine cried out in futile protest
My God man what have you done What does this mean
And then in a blaze of rage he was on his feet Murder was in his
heart as he set himself for a crashing charge that would sweep the
beast from his feet His own flamepistol was missing it was a case of
killing this monster with his bare hands Tom was circling over there
cursing horribly One of them would get him Strangely Antazzo had
lowered the muzzles of his pistols
A terrific punch started from the floor never reached its mark
Blaine saw a tiny puff of pinkish vapor that spurted from the bosom of
that metallic garment He was coughing and gasping helpless Muscles
refused to do his bidding With a moan he dropped into the pilots
seat knowing that Antazzos will compelled him That gas had hypnotic
powers Mechanically his fingers strayed to the controls
And Tomgood old Tommyhe was under the influence of the stuff too
creeping there on hands and knees toward the engine room companionway
Antazzo was talking We come now to the matter of instructions he
said You Farley will assist me in restoring the ignition system to
normal You Carson will keep to the controls and will lay a course to
Jupiter as soon as the control rockettubes will respond Understand
Tom growled reluctant assent from where he was crawling
Strange this hypnotic gas Blaines mind functioned clearly enough
yet he was utterly at the mercy of this madmans willa robot of flesh
and blood Jupiter he exclaimed Why man its nearly a half
billion miles from the sun Not habitable either
Antazzo had removed his mask and now smiled a superior smile Well
reach it he said the RX8 is very fast And its not the planet
itself were bound for but its second satellite Io your astronomers
call this body and its a world sadly in need of this marvelous
kmetal
Butbut
Enough The hunchback snarled his rebuke in Blaines face and
turned to Tom Come Farley he said as if talking to a child we
must get to work
In a daze of conflicting emotions Blaine turned to gaze through the
forward port when the two had left the control room The RX8 was
accelerating rapidly under the steady discharge of gases from the stern
rockettube and had already reached the speed of one thousand miles a
second If one of those tiny asteroids even one no larger than a
marble should meet up with them it would crash through the hull plates
as if they were paper His heart went cold at the thought
Oddly enough he found himself wanting to make this trip with the
demoniac Antazzo It was the effects of the pink gas Even with the
misshapen guard down there in the engine room the power of his will was
effective The devil must be an Ionian he thought But how in the name
of the skylane imps had he reached Earth How had he wormed his way
into the confidence of the kmetal people He must have been there
several years working to this very end
There was a tinkling crash on the starboard side amidships a screaming
swish as something slithered along the side and caromed off into the
void One of those little planetoids Probably no bigger than a pea
and luckily they had struck it glancingly He wiped the sudden
perspiration from his forehead
Pressure on the directive rocket controls brought no response Would
they never finish with that ignition system
A gleaming lightfleck segregated itself from the mass of stars ahead
At first he thought he imagined it but a second examination this time
through the telescope convinced him it was growing larger Drawing
nearer it was and resolving itself into a well defined orb that was
directly in their path Fifteen hundred miles a second the indicator
read now Theyd never know what happened when they struck
Tommy he bellowed into the mike Are you fellows ever going to
finish down there
There was no reply for a moment and the bluewhite globe drove madly
toward them He consulted the chart Pallasan asteroid some three
hundred miles in diameter Not very big as celestial bodies go but big
enough
Just one minute now It was Tommys voice coming drearily
unnaturally through the audiophone A minute Ninety thousand miles It
seemed the asteroid was that close already
Antazzo was in the control room then and the effect of his mental
dominance became more pronounced Suddenly the dwarf let out a shriek
of terror when he looked through the port and saw the brilliant body
that now loomed so close Blaine experienced a savage joy in the
knowledge that the hunchback was mortally afraid
Latza Latza In his fear Antazzo lapsed into his own tongue Then
remembering he shouted Were ready Carson Swing wide
The directive rockets answered to their controls now Quick pressure on
this a swift pull on that swinging the energy value to maximum
brought results The little vessel groaned and shivered under the
strain as a full blast from the forward tubes retarded them Her hull
plates twisted and screeched as the steering tubes belched full energy
in swinging them from their course They were thrown forward violently
though the deceleration compensators were working to the utmost
Pallas swung around in their field of vision and there was a fleeting
glimpse of sunlit spires of mountains shadowed valleys and
mysterious crevasses from which clouds of steam and yellow vapor
curled Still it seemed they must crash against one of those slender
pinnacles Nearer it came like a flash a dizzying blur now that
drove directly in their straining faces
And then abruptly it was gone Already thousands of miles astern the
danger was past Miraculously they had escaped
Antazzo laughed a hollow mirthless cackle His fingers shook crazily
when he untwisted them from their grip on the port rail
Good work my friend Very good indeed he jabbered his chin
quivering in nervous reaction And now we carry onon to Io
Blaine Carson almost wishing they had collided with the spire set
himself grimly to the task He was powerless to refuse
CHAPTER II
The Second Satellite
When eventually they swung into the orbit of Jupiter and headed in
toward the enormous redbelted body the two Earth men were heartily
disgusted with the voyage and with themselves Repeated doses of the
pink gasthe ignominy of their utter subservience to the will of
Antazzohad worn them down no less than had the hard work and loss of
sleep Both were in vile humor They endured the triumphant chatter of
their captor in bitter silence
Over there my friends he said pointing see It is our
destination The golden crescent Io is something over a quarter
million of your miles from the mother planet See it It is home my
friends home to me and for yourselves in the futureif the Zara
spares your lives Lay your course to the body Carson
Blaine growled as he sighted through the telescope Yet in spite of
his fury he could not overcome the feeling of excitement that came to
him when the powerful glass brought the satellite near This body was
like nothing else in the heavens Antazzo had called it the golden
crescent Rather it was of gleaming coppery hue and now as they
swung around it was fully illuminateda brilliant sphere of unbroken
contour Smoothly globular there was not one projection or indentation
to indicate the existence of land or sea mountain or valley on its
surface It was like a ball of solid copper scintillant there in the
weak sunlight and the reflected light from its great mother planet
Antazzo laughed over his absorption Looks peculiar to you does it
not he asked rather different from any of the bodies you have
visited you are thinking
Blaine grunted wordless assent The globe that was Io rushed in to meet
them growing ever larger in the field of the telescope Now it
appeared that there were tiny seams in the smooth surface a regular
crisscross pattern of fine lines that looked likeLord yes that was
it The body was constructed from an infinite number of copper plates
riveted or brazed together to form a perfect sphere
Why the things made of copper Blaine gasped Copper plates Its
a manmade world artificial But where are the inhabitants
Antazzo laughed uproariously Not manmade my friend he corrected
but preserved by man for his own salvation A dying world it was and
the cleverest scientists in the universe saved it and themselves from
certain death What you see is merely a shell of copper the covering
they constructed to retain an atmosphere and make continuation of life
possibleinside
Your people live inside that shell Blaine was incredulous
What else We must have air to breathe and warmth for our bodies How
else could we have retained it
It was staggering this revelation The young pilot could not conceive
of a completely enclosed world with inhabitants forever shut off from
the light of the sun by day and from the beauties of the heavens by
night Yet here it was drawing ever nearer a colossal monument to the
ingenuity and handiwork of a highly intelligent civilization who had
labored probably for centuries to preserve their kind A titanic task
Who could imagine a sphere of metal more than twentyfour hundred miles
in diameter enclosing a world and its peoples A copperclad world
They were coming in close now and the gravitational pull of the body
made itself felt Blaine was busy with the controls sending tremendous
blasts from the forward rockettubes to retard their speed for a safe
landing The incredibly smooth copper surface was just beneath them
stretching miles away to the horizon in all directions
The inductor compass was functioning Evidently Io possessed as strong
a magnetic field as did the inner planets Antazzo now consulted a
chart which he drew from his pocket and examined minutely the surface
over which they were speeding Here and there curious designs were
etched on the copper plates and it was from these he determined their
course Obviously there was an entrance to this sealedin world
When they had proceeded some two thousand miles in a northeasterly
direction Antazzo gave the order to reduce speed Off at the horizon
there appeared a bulge in the copper surface a round protuberance that
resolved itself into a great domeshaped structure as they drew nearer
A full two hundred feet it reared itself into the heavens and Blaine
saw a number of large circular hatches in its side that evidently
covered airlocked entrances
You will land close by the dome Carson Antazzo barked and both of
you will get into your moonsuits
At his tone Blaine saw red He realized on the instant that the effect
of the pink gas had worn off and that he was his own master once more
All the pentup emotions of the past few days were unleashed If only
he could get in one good punch They might get away yet There was
plenty of kmetal to replenish the fuel supply He whirled suddenly
muscles tensed He faced the grinning hunchbackand was greeted by a
breathtaking spurt of the pink gas This time it was not merely a
subjecting of his own will to that of the master but a complete
hypnotism a somnambulistic state As in a dream he turned to the
controls
Now it came to him that the dwarf no longer spoke He worked his will
entirely without words his evil mind possessed fully the mind of his
victim For Blaine Carson there was no further independent thinking He
was an automaton a sleepwalker
Like a detached and more or less disinterested observer he saw that he
had landed the ship Then he noticed three dwarfs in bulky helmeted
moonsuits shuffling clumsily across the copper plates Hazily he knew
he was with the others in an airlock the hiss and the throbbing of
pumps told him that Under the great dome there was the latticework of
a huge reflecting telescope strange pigmy figures scuttled here and
there working at curious machines There was the constant purr of many
motors the gentle pulsation of floorplates beneath his feet
With the moonsuit removed he realized the atmosphere was fetid and
stifling A great pressure bore on his lungs making breathing labored
and difficult And then they were in a lift that dropped into the
depths of its shaft with dizzying speed Antazzos grin Toms eyes
dull and lifeless floating there in the haze before his ownit was
all a nightmare from which he must soon awaken
There followed a period of complete unconsciousness of movement and of
his surroundings Lightlight everywhere a bluewhite radiance that
beat upon his unseeing eyes with unrelenting ferocity Stabbing pains
bored into his very brain pains that carried with them an unspoken and
unintelligible command Why couldnt they let him alone leave him to
die in peace He knew he was on his feet swaying There were voices
strident and guttural and then by some magic the veil was lifted His
brain cleared and he saw that he stood before a dais where a much
bejeweled and resplendently clad woman sat curled in the luxurious
cushions of a golden seat Chalkwhite was her face and her lips
crimson amazing eyes cats eyes pupils redflecked and glittering
stared out at him
The Zara Antazzo whispered You will make obeisance
Mechanically Blaine dropped to his knees and touched his forehead to
the floor Tom Farley over there was doing the same but Antazzo
stood erect with arms crossed over his chest and head thrown back The
eyes of the Zara swept him contemptuously from head to foot All was
not well between them
Blaine arose from his humiliating position at a sharp command from the
hunchback Tommy did likewise and the two exchanged sheepish looks The
effects of the pink gas were wearing off once more They were in a
large hall obviously the throne room of a palace Menatarms lined
the walls on either side of the dais and these were straight limbed
giants with greenbronze skin and regular featuresnot at all like the
deformed Ionian who had captured them and stolen the RX8
The Zara talked rapidly in throaty gutturals her fierce gaze directed
at Antazzo and her brows drawn together in a scowl that could have but
one meaning She was displeased with the hunchback displeased and
furiously angry What was it all about Hadnt he brought home the
baconthe kmetal they were after Blaine was nonplused
Then Antazzo replied to the woman who was obviously his queen His
voice rose in shrill disagreement and his scowl was as fierce as the
Zaras Threatening her he was the nervy devil He clenched his fists
and raised his arms in an angry gesture pacing the floor in his fury
and thrusting out a pugnacious chin while he raved This Zara woman
rose higher in her cushions and the look that flashed from those
terrible eyes would have warned a less excited human however
justifiable his anger might be But Antazzo was in too deep to draw
back that was plain to be seen Blaine held his breath in anticipation
of an explosion
It came then that explosion and in a way entirely unexpected and
horrible to behold The tiger woman uttered one fierce sibilant like
the hiss of a serpent a terrifying sound that silenced the hunchback
and brought him stiffly to attention mouth open and eyes bulging with
horror One of those unbelievably white arms stretched forth
threateningly tense and a jeweled finger leveled itself at the rash
Ionian From it there flashed an intangible something that leaped to
bridge the distance with the speed of light something that screeched
as it flew and crashed like breaking glass when it struck Antazzos
horrified face In an instant he was on the floor screaming and
writhing in mortal agony
The Zara watched with compressed lips and livid features as a host of
black disklike things covered the squirming body spinning madly as if
driven by atomic energy and emitting a myriad highpitched tones like
the angry buzzing of a swarm of bees Antazzos body shriveled as the
things hummed on in their devilish work Soon there was but a tiny heap
of clothing with the angry black disks whirling and singing their song
of hate And then in a puff of thick yellow vapor they were gone
their gruesome work completed The odor of putrefaction lay heavy on
the air
Blaine shuddered and a fit of nausea twisted his vitals It served the
devil right of course but it was a horrible way to go These damned
Ionians even to their queen were bloodthirsty creatures And what
devilish ingenuity they had displayed in their development of weapons
His eyes were drawn irresistibly to the flaming orbs of the Zara
She was actually smiling at him this beautiful heartless animal not
a smile of derision but one of deliberate allure He felt the hot blood
mount to his temples A languid arm beckoned him to her side and the
amazing creature settled back in her cushions with the drowsy
contented motions of a lazy feline
Watch your step Tommy hissed
That warning was unnecessary Blaine shook his head and backed away
from the dais an instinctive recoiling from a loathsome thing The
Zara saw and understood and she went again into a black rage She sat
stiffly erect and called rapid orders to her menatarms
The Earth men were surrounded instantly their arms and legs pinioned
by powerful hands their feeble resistance overcome by the bronze
giants as easily as if they had been children Helpless and hopeless
they were borne from the room
This was the end of the story Blaine thought Why this Zara woman had
not made away with them at once was a mystery Perhaps they were being
reserved for an even more terrible fate than that of the hunchback
They were being carried along a dimlit passage now and Tom was
cursing his captors in a neverending stream of invective
A metal door opened and then clanged shut behind them They were dumped
unceremoniously on metal tables that resembled those of a hospital
operatingroom on Earth Woven bands quickly adjusted by the bronze
giants held them fast Blaine turned his head and saw that Tommy was
still struggling against the inevitable A gag had been placed in his
mouth that was why he had ceased reviling the Zaras servitors
The room was cluttered with elaborate and complicated mechanisms that
Blaine could not recognize in the slightest detail excepting that
there were many banks of slender glass cylinders which bore some
resemblance to the vacuum tubes used on the inner planets for radio
communication and television One of the bronze giants he saw was
bringing a metal cap from which a cable extended to one of the strange
machines This cap was forced down over his head with a none too gentle
pressure and he could see no more
There came a sharp buzz from the machine and a million stinging needles
drove into his brain There was a moment of fleeting visions strange
places he viewed and strange creatures parading in a fantasmagoria of
delirium before his aching eyes Voices harsh and guttural spoke in
his drumming ears voices that were dimly understandable though
uttered in the tongue spoken by Antazzo and the Zara Then came sudden
and merciful unconsciousness
CHAPTER III
Ilendar
When Blaine Carson opened his eyes it was to stare at the bluewhite
radiance of an illuminated ceiling He lay on a downy cot and it seemed
he had just recovered from a long illness Weak and sick he turned his
head listlessly to gaze at the ornate embossed designs on a wall of
gleaming silvery metal What place was this His mind was woolgathering
dim memories of unspeakable things struggled for mastery over a hazy
consciousness Suddenly then he remembered and he sat up in his
unfamiliar bed senses acutely alert
Across the room he saw a figure hunched in a chair a twisted
mancreature who was oddly like someone he had seen Antazzo But this
one had none of the others ferocity as he returned Blaines stare
Rather there was a look of deep concern in his ugly face He came
immediately to the bedside and looked at Blaine solicitously
I see you have recovered he said It is good
Blaine stared and stared This creature had spoken in the language of
the Zaras subjects yet he understood his every word It must be a
dream this impossible thing that had happened And where was Tom
Abruptly he found that he was talking rapidly in this tongue of an
alien race
Yes Ive recovered he said and Im amazed at what I find How
have I acquired this knowledge of your language Where am I and where
is my friend Can you enlighten me in these things
The other smiled I can Earth man he replied You have been taught
our language while you slept A thought transference process we use for
educating the young You are in the palace of the Zara and your friend
is safe in the next room I may add that you are in high favor with Her
Majesty
The wizened creature lowered his voice on the last words and his
knowing eyes spoke volumes In favor with that shedevil Blaine went
cold at the thought
I want to see my friend he said shortly
Later My orders are to bring you to the Zara immediately you are
strong enough And Pegrani obeys orders
No use to attempt a break now Blaine was tempted to drive a fist into
that ugly countenance and fight his way out of the place But that
would be suicide Hed wait get the lay of the land first and then try
to dope something out with Tommy
All right Pegrani he said Im ready to go before this Zara of
yours
As he prepared for the audience alien thoughts crowded one upon the
other in his strangely enlightened mind With the knowledge of the
language had come knowledge of many things relative to the copperclad
world Theyd given him a liberal education Somehow he knew these
stunted creatures like Antazzo and Pegrani were known as Llotta and
that while ruling the sealedin planet their kind had originally come
from Ganymede the fifth satellite of Jupiter Centuries had passed
since the inhabitants of Europa and Ganymede had been forced to desert
their aging worlds and had settled on Io During other centuries the
widely different peoples had cooperated in constructing the great
copper enclosure in order to keep the new world alive and capable of
supporting life Then had come a century of bitter warfare in which the
Llotta were victorious Intense hatred existed between the two races
he knew and a hazy impression of mechanically imparted knowledge told
him that few of the Europans remained alive
We are here Carson his guide announced when they stood before the
square columns of an enormous portal
The scene in the throne room was vastly different than when he had
first visited it The Zara sat curled as before a golden bowl of
incense burning at either side of the throne The menatarms were
absent and instead there were dozens of handmaidens whiteskinned
and seductive as their queen reclining on luxurious cushions that were
arranged in a semicircle before the dais It was a scene of Oriental
splendor A stage carefully set
Pegrani knelt and touched his forehead to the floor but Blaine held
himself stiffly erect looking straight into the eyes of the Zara She
smiled and extended her arm in that beckoning gesture
You may leave now Pegrani she said without deigning him a glance
Remain in the corridor until I send for you
There was a tense silence as the Zaras gaze ineffably softened now
held Blaines Unconsciously he was drawn to the steps of the dais
Unwillingly yet inexorably his lagging footsteps brought him to her
side Cool white fingers touched his arm and he saw that the red flecks
in the black of those wide eyes were golden now Surely there was no
harm in this woman But he remembered Antazzo
Carson she purred you are more than welcome to Llottanar the
land of my people and the ruling power of Antrid the body you call Io
The freedom of the realm is yours for as long a time as you wish to
remain
This was too good to be true Youyou mean he stammered that
Antazzo exceeded his authority in his act of piracyin bringing us
here
The golden flecks flashed red and a cold note was manifest in the
throaty voice Antazzo she replied was destroyed for his audacious
actions We needed this kmetal of yours Carson and he was sent to
Earth to get a quantity of the material By magnetic directional waves
was he sentwe have no spaceshipshis body disintegrated by my
scientists for transmittal and the atoms of his beastly form
reassembled in their proper relation when he arrived there But he
threatened me when he returned successful The possession of the
kmetal and his knowledge of its powers and uses had gone to his head
He demanded my hand in return for his work demanded that he be
permitted to mount the throne of Llottanar as my consort Therefore I
destroyed him The hard eyes softened anew Andand for his
abominable treatment of you I destroyed him she concluded
Blaine fought off the spell of those goldflecked eyes he looked away
in sudden panic This creature was not telling the truth She was
hiding something a sinister motive lay beneath her smooth speech
My friend he said abruptly what of him
For your sake my Carson she purred he too shall have the freedom
of the realm for as long a time as is desired
The cool fingers crept along his arm firm and compelling Look at
me she whispered
He thought of the pink gas as his eyes were drawn irresistibly to hers
What he saw in those goldflecked depths sent a shiver of apprehension
chasing down his spine Savage devastating desire mingled with
illconcealed rage at his coldness This beautiful animal could turn
like a flash and rend him limb from limband would on the slightest
provocation
A commotion in the corridor caused her to release him and sit bolt
upright Temporarily relieved Blaine wheeled to face the portal Tommy
had broken loose He heard his strident voice berating an unseen
antagonist in the tongue of the Llotta
Then they were in the room Tommy struggling and arguing vociferously
with one of the greenbronze guards The handmaidens had deserted their
cushions and were milling about in affrighted confusion The Zaras
sibilant exclamation startled him into looking at her once more The
same cold fury that had greeted Antazzo glinted icyhard in that grimly
beautiful face It was all over for poor Tommy
But the Zara reached upward and stroked a transparent rod that dangled
above the throne something he had not noticed before A screaming
vibrant note smote the heavy air a pulsation that beat at the ear
drums with painful intensity Silence fell as the awesome sound died
away and echoed faintly from the huge columns that supported the arched
ceiling Tommy cooled off when he saw that Blaine was unharmed
Drekan The Zaras voice was a whiplash as she addressed the guard
You will leave my presence and report to your overman for punishment
Never again molest the Earth men Begone
Again this amazing woman curled in her cushions and again she purred
Tommy watched in open mouthed astonishment as she smiled guilelessly on
his friend
You may leave me now my Carson she cooed Farley is free to
accompany you Pegrani will guide you and inform you regarding our
customs and our people You will learn much And then you shall return
to Zara Clyone
Blaine had fully expected that Tommy would die a horrible death before
his eyes and in his sudden relief bent low and kissed the cold white
hand of the Zara A foolish thing to do She purred and snuggled into
the cushions like the feline she wasa dangerous animal claws drawn
in now but ready to strike out razor sharp on a moments notice
Pegrani led them along the corridor to a lift The car shot upward with
breathtaking speed
