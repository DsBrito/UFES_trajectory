him over many hard places when family troubles and straitened
circumstances pressed upon the old revolutionist
This work is Engels testimony with regard to the method employed by
them in arriving at their philosophical conclusions It is the statement
of the philosophical foundations of modern socialism by one who helped
to lay them it is an old mans account of the case upon the preparation
of which he has spent his entire life for this work short as it is
represents the results of forty years of toil and persevering effort
As the Communist Manifesto was a gage flung with all the impetuosity
of youthful impatience into the face of constituted authority so this
is the deliberate statement of the veteran who has learned the game too
well to leave any openings and proceeds to the demolition of pet
opinions in a quiet deadly and deliberate fashion
Step by step the argument is built up The ghosts of old controversies
long since buried are raised to show how the doctrine imperishably
associated with the names of Marx and Engels came into existence the
Young Hegelians the Tuebingen School and finally Feuerbach himself
are summoned from the grave to which the Revolution of 1848 had
consigned them Still ancient history as these controversies are from
the German standpoint such is the backwardness of philosophy among
Englishspeaking peoples that we find Engels exposing again and again
fallacies which persist even in our time and ridiculing sentiments
which we receive with approbation in our political assemblies and with
mute approval in our churches and conventicles
The antireligious note is noticeable throughout in itself an echo of
controversies long past when the arguments of the critics of the Bible
were creating now fury now dismay throughout Christendom before the
Higher Criticism had become respected and before soidisant sceptics
could continue to go solemnly to church
Moreover the work was written in German for German workmen for whom
religion has not the same significance as it apparently still continues
to possess for the Englishspeaking people whose sensitiveness upon the
subject appears to have outlived their faith However that may be
religious bodies possess a curious and perhaps satisfactory faculty of
absorbing the truths of science and still continuing to exist and even
to thrive upon what the inexperienced might easily mistake for a deadly
diet
Under the circumstances there is no reason why Engels remarks should
affect even the timorous although it must be remembered that a very
able English socialist philosopher is reputed to have damaged his
chances irretrievably by an illjudged quotation from Mr Swinburne
It must be confessed that the occasional bitterness in which Engels
indulges is to be deplored in a work of so essentially intellectual a
character but it is little to be wondered at His contempt for
university professors and the pretentious cultivated classes who claim
so much upon such slight grounds is not strange when we consider the
honest labors of himself and his colleagues and the superficial
placehunting of the recognized savants He loves learning for its own
sake for the sake of truth and scientific accuracy and he cannot feel
anything but scorn for those who use it as a means to lull the
consciences of the rich and to gain place and power for themselves The
degradation of German philosophy affects him with a real sorrow the
scholar is outraged at the mockery Sterility eclecticism these
are the terms in which he sums up the teachings of the official
professors and they are almost too gentle to be applied to the
dispiriting and disheartening doctrines which are taught to the
Englishspeaking student of today under the name of economics or
philosophy
In the first part of his pamphlet for it is little more in size Engels
gives a short and concise account of the work of Hegel and the later
Hegelian School He shows how the philosophy of Hegel has both a
conservative and a radical side and how conservatives and radicals alike
might as a matter of fact they did each derive support from his
teachings according to the amount of stress laid respectively upon the
great divisions of his work the System and the Dialectic
The Extreme Left developed through the application of the dialectic
and applied the philosophic doctrine thus derived to the criticism of
existing political and religious institutions This resulted in the
gradual throwing away of the abstract part of the Hegelian philosophy
and in the study of facts and phenomena to an everincreasing degree
Marx had in his youth allied himself with the Young Hegelians as
this school was called and this fact had no slight influence upon his
subsequent career His critics lay the blame for much of the obscurity
of language from which Capital in particular suffers at the door of
this training His painful elaboration of thesis antithesis and
synthesis his insistence upon the dialectic and his continual use of
the Hegelian philosophical expressions are due to his earlier
controversial experiences Still on the other hand his patient
investigation of actual facts his insistence on the value of positive
knowledge as compared with abstract theory and his diligent and
persistent use of bluebooks and statistics were in a great measure
results of the same training
Now and again we find Engels in this work displaying remarkable
controversial acumen as in his discussion of the phrase All that is
real is reasonable and all that is reasonable is real Alles was
wirklich ist ist vernuenftig und alles was vernuenftig ist ist
wirklich From this expression by the development of the Hegelian
argument he arrives at the conclusion involved in the statement that
the value of a social or political phenomenon is its transitoriness the
necessity of its disappearance Hence the abolition of dogmatic
statement and mere subjective reasoning in the realm of philosophy the
destruction of the old school of which Kant was the chief exponent and
the creation of a new school the most advanced teachers of which were
as they still are the materialistic socialists of whom Engels and Marx
are the chief
The object of this historical sketch is to show the origin of
Feuerbachs philosophy as well as of that of Marx and Engels As the
fight between the Young Hegelians and the conservatives grew hotter
the radicals were driven back upon the EnglishFrench materialism of the
preceding century This was embarrassing for followers of Hegel who had
been taught to regard the material as the mere expression of the Idea
Feuerbach relieved them from the contradiction He grasped the question
boldly and threw the Hegelian abstraction completely to one side His
book Wesen des Christenthums in which his ideas were set forth
became immediately popular and an English translation which was widely
read was made of it by George Eliot under the title of Essence of
Christianity
Engels is by no means grudging of expressions of appreciation with
regard to this work and its effects both upon himself and the educated
world in general This unendurable debt of honor paid however he
proceeds to attack the idealistic humanitarianism which Feuerbach had
made the basis and sanction of his ethical theories
Although Feuerbach had arrived at the materialistic conclusion he
expressed himself as unable to accept materialism as a doctrine He
says that as far as the past is concerned he is a materialist but for
the future he is not soBackward I am in agreement with the
materialists forward nota statement which impels Engels to examine
the materialism of the eighteenth century which he finds purely
mechanical without any conception of the universe as a process and
therefore utterly inadequate for the philosophic needs of the period at
which Feuerbach wrote for by that time the advance of science and the
greater powers of generalization arising from patient experimentation
and the development of the evolutionary theory had rendered the
eighteenth century views evidently absurd
The vulgarising peddlers vulgarisirenden Hausirer come in for a
great deal of contempt at the hands of Engels These were the popular
materialiststhe blatant atheists who without scientific knowledge
and gifted with mere oratory or a popular style of writing used every
advance of science as a weapon of attack upon the Creator and popular
religion Engels sneers at these as not being scientists at all but
mere tradesmen dealing in pseudoscientific wares He calls their
occupation a trade a business Geschaeft Of the same class was that
host of secularist lecturers who at one time thronged the lecture
platforms of the Englishspeaking countries and of whom Bradlaugh and
Ingersoll were in every way the best representatives These secularists
have now ceased to exercise any influence and the Freethought
societies at one time so numerous have now practically disappeared In
accordance with the theories as set forth by Engels they were bound to
disappear their teachings had no real bearing upon social progress
they contributed nothing of any scientific value to modern thought and
as Engels carefully shows the reading of history by these lecturers was
vitiated by a lack of scientific grasp and inability to take a rational
view of the great principles of historical development
In the third part of this little book Engels deals with a very
interesting question which still disturbs the minds of philosophers and
concerning which much discussion goes on even among the materialists
that is the question as to the effect of religion upon social progress
Feuerbach had made the statement that periods of social progress are
marked by religious changes He uses religion as a synonym for human
love forcing the meaning of the word religion from the Latin
religare to tie in order to give it an etymological and derivative
meaning in support of his statement a controversial trick for which he
is rebuked by Engels The declaration that great historical revolutions
are accompanied by religious changes is declared by Engels not to be
true except in a limited degree as regards the three great
worldreligionsChristianity Mahommedanism and Buddhism
Engels declared that the change in religion simultaneous with economic
and political revolution stopped short with the bourgeois revolt which
was made without any appeal to religion whatsoever It is evident that
this is not entirely true for in the Englishspeaking countries at all
events not only the bourgeois but frequently also the proletarian
movements attempt to justify themselves from Scripture The teachings of
the Bible and the Sermon on the Mount are frequently called to the aid
of the revolutionary party Christian Socialists in the English and
American not the continental sense of the term as such are admitted to
the International Congresses and other evidences of the compatibility
of religion with the proletarian movement can be traced
But in the broader sense of his statement Engels is undoubtedly correct
The proletarian movement unlike that of the bourgeois has produced no
definite religious school it has not claimed any particular set of
religious doctrines as its own As a matter of fact there appears to be
an everwidening chasm between the Church and the laborer a condition
of affairs which is frequently deplored in religious papers The famous
Papal Encyclical on Labor was certainly intended to retain the masses in
the Church and the formation of trades unions under the influence of
the priests was a logical conclusion from the teachings of the Papal
Encyclical But such religious movements are in no sense representative
of the workingclass movement in fact they are resented and antagonized
by the regular proletarian movement which proceeds under the leadership
of the Socialists
Feuerbachs exaltation of humanitarianism as a religion is derided by
Engels in a semijocular semiserious manner for his statement that
Feuerbachs ideals can be completely realized on the Bourse cannot be
taken seriously Engels clearsightedness with regard to the
ineffectiveness of a purely humanitarian religion is very remarkable
although the forty years additional experience which he had over
Feuerbach was a great advantage to him in estimating the actual value of
humanitarian religion as an influence in human affairs Since the time
of Feuerbach various experiments in the direction of a religion based
entirely on Love have been tried and none of them has succeeded
Positivism or its religious side has been a failure It has appealed to
a small set of men some of whom are possessed of great ability and
have accomplished much but as a religion in any adequate sense of the
word positivism will be admitted a failure by its most sincere
adherents Brotherhood Churches the Church of Humanity the Peoples
Church and other like organizations have been formed having the same
humanitarian basis professing to cultivate a maximum of love with a
minimum of faith and have failed to impress ordinary men and women
Theosophy a system of oriental mysticism based on an abstract
conception of the brotherhood of man has also put forth its claims to
notice on the grounds of its broad humanitarianism None of these
humanitarian religions however appear to satisfy the needs of the
times which do not seem to demand any humanitarian teachings The only
religions which evidently persist are the dogmatic those appealing
undisguisedly to faith and even these do not maintain their proletarian
following
Engels remarks appear to be more than justified by the facts of today
for so far from the proletarian forming a new religion representing his
needs on the ideological field he appears to be increasingly
desirous of releasing himself from the bands of any religion whatever
and substituting in place of it practical ethics and the teachings of
science Thus we are informed that five out of six of the working
classes of Berlin who attend any Sunday meetings whatever are to be
found in the halls of the Social Democratic Party listening to the
lectures provided by that organization
The revolutionary character of Feuerbachs philosophy is not maintained
in his ethic which Engels declares with much truth to be no better than
that of his predecessors as the basis on which it stands is no more
substantial Feuerbach fails as a teacher of practical ethics he is
smothered in abstraction and cannot attain to any reality
With the last part of the work Engels abandons the task of criticising
Feuerbach and proceeds to expound his own philosophy
With absolute candor and modesty he gives Marx credit for the theory of
the materialistic conception of history upon the enunciation and proof
of which he had himself worked almost incessantly ever since the first
idea of the theory had occurred to them forty years prior to the time
when he wrote this work The footnote to the first page of the fourth
part is the testimony of a collaborator to the genius of his
fellowworkman an example of appreciation and modest selfeffacement
which it would not be easy to match and to which literary men who work
together are not overprone Nothing else could bear more eloquent
testimony to the loftiness of character and sincerity of purpose of
these two exiles
The Marxian philosophy of history is clearly stated and so fully
explained by Engels that there is no need to go over the ground again
and there only remains to call attention to some of the modern
developments in the direction of rigidity of interpretation and to the
exaggeration of the broad theory of the predominance of the economic
factor into a hard and fast doctrine of economic determinism
When we examine the claims of Engels on behalf of the materialistic
doctrine it will be found that they are not by any means of such a
nature as to warrant the extreme conclusions of subsequent socialist
publicists and leaders It must be remembered that the subject of the
influence of economic conditions on religious and political phenomena
has been closely examined of late years and continual and accumulating
evidence has been forthcoming respecting the remarkable influence of
economic facts upon all other manifestations of social activity It is
very probable that the successful investigations in this new field have
led temporarily to the formation of exaggerated ideas as to the actual
value of the economic factor
Marx in one of his short critical notes on Feuerbach says The
materialistic doctrine that men are products of conditions and
education different men therefore products of other conditions and a
different kind of education forgets that circumstances may be altered
by man and that the educator has himself to be educated In other
words the problem like all problems possesses at least two
quantities it is not a question solely of conditions economic or
otherwise it is a question of man and conditions for the man is never
dissolved in the conditions but exists as a separate entity and these
two elements man and conditions act and react the one upon the other
This is quite a different position from that taken by Lafargue in his
fight with Jaures Lafargue there argued that economic development is
the sole determinant of progress and pronounces in favor of economic
determinism thus reducing the whole of history and consequently the
dominating human motives to but one elementary motive Belfort Bax the
wellknown English socialist writer makes a very clever argument
against the determinist position by comparing it with the attempts of
the preSocratic Greek philosophers to reduce nature to one element His
remarks are so pertinent that a brief abstract of his argument is here
quoted in his own language He says in Outlooks from a New Standpoint
The endeavor to reduce the whole of Human life to one element alone to
reconstruct all history on the basis of Economics as already said
ignores the fact that every concrete reality must have a material and a
formal sidethat is it must have at least two ultimate elementsall
reality as opposed to abstraction consisting in a synthesis The attempt
to evolve the manysidedness of Human life out of one of its factors no
matter how important that factor may be reminds one of the attempts of
the early preSocratic Greeks to reduce nature to one element such as
water air fire etc
And again
The precise form a movement takes be it intellectual ethical or
artistic I fully admit is determined by the material circumstances of
the society in which it acquires form and shape but it is also
determined by those fundamental psychological tendencies which have
given it birth
Enrico Ferri the famous Italian member of the Chamber of Deputies and
criminologist appears to be at one with Bax in this matter He says
quoting from a recent translation of his Socialism and Modern Science
It is perfectly true that every phenomenon as well as every
institutionmoral juridicial or politicalis simply the result of
the economic phenomena and the conditions of the transitory physical
and historical environments But as a consequence of that law of natural
causality which tells us that every effect is always the resultant of
numerous concurrent causes and not of one cause alone and that every
effect becomes in its turn a cause of other phenomena it is necessary
to amend and complete the too rigid form that has been given to this
true idea
Just as all psychical manifestations of the individual are the result
of the organic conditions temperament and of the environment in which
he lives in the same way all the social manifestations of a people are
the resultant of their organic conditions race and of the environment
as these are the determining causes of the given economic organization
which is the physical basis of life
These may be said to be fairly representative of the views of the
opposition to the extreme of economic determinism
The whole controversy has spread over a tremendous amount of ground and
involves much reading Some of the chief results have lately been
summarized by Professor Seligman in his Economic Interpretation of
History Macmillan 1902 His written views show a closer
approximation to and understanding of the teachings of the socialist
philosophy on this subject than we have been accustomed to receive at
the hands of official savants so that it would seem as if the value of
Marxs work was at last beginning to be appreciated even in the foggy
studies of the professors Two extracts from the writings of Engels are
quoted by Professor Seligman These extracts apparently go to prove that
Engels by no means contemplated the extreme construction which has been
placed upon the doctrine and that he would find such a construction
inconsistent with his general views
These extracts are quoted here for the purpose of further elucidating
the views of Engels and as further explanatory of the position assumed
by him in the last part of the work under consideration
They form part of a series of articles written for the Sozialistische
Akademiker in 1890 and are as follows
Marx and I are partly responsible for the fact that the younger men
have sometimes laid more stress on the economic side than it deserves
In meeting the attacks of our opponents it was necessary for us to
emphasize the dominant principle denied by them and we did not always
have the time place or opportunity to let the other factors which were
concerned in the mutual action and reaction get their deserts
And in another letter to the same magazine he says According to the
materialistic view of history the factor which is in last instance
decisive in history is the production and reproduction of actual life
More than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted But when anyone
distorts this so as to read that the economic factor is the sole element
he converts the statement into a meaningless abstract absurd phrase
The economic condition is the basis but the various elements of the
superstructurethe political forms of the classcontests and their
results the constitutionsthe legal forms and also all the reflexes of
these actual contests in the brains of the participants the political
legal philosophical theories the religions viewsall these exert an
influence on the development of the historical struggles and in many
instances determine their form
Here we may leave this much disputed matter for the present as any
involved discussion of controversial questions would be out of place
here The question in its ultimate form is merely scholastic for not
even the most extreme determinist would hold that only the economic
argument must be relied upon by the orators and the press of the
proletarian movement Any one however who wishes to pursue the subject
farther can find abundant material in the already great and growing
amount of literature in connection with it
There is no doubt that the ideas of Marx respecting the basis of
historical progress have already revolutionized the teaching of history
in the universities although but few professors have been honest enough
to give him credit for it The economic factor continually acquires
greater importance in the eyes of the student of history but the
practical discoverer of this factor is still slighted and the results of
his labors are assimilated with a selfsatisfied hypocrisy which is
unfortunately characteristic of the colleges of the Englishspeaking
countries
The bourgeois writers upon socialism generally content themselves with
the bold statement that Marx employs the dialectic method of
investigation and statement This is so much Greek to the ordinary
reader and the subject of the dialectic as used by socialist writers
requires a few words of explanation
The first part of this work is very valuable therefore as showing what
Marx and Engels meant when they used the expression and as declaring
their estimation of that method compared with that in general use in
their day and always prior to their time employed in philosophy
history and economics
A fuller and more detailed definition of the dialectic as applied by
Engels is given by that philosopher in his famous reply to Eugene
Duhring known as the Umwaelzung der Wissenschaft In that work a more
thorough and patient investigation is made into the sources of
materialistic philosophy of the socialist movement for the reputation
of his antagonist appears to have acted as a spur to Engels faculties
which certainly never showed to better advantage than in that work A
portion of the argument in fact an abstract of the general train of
reasoning with the omission of the more obviously controversial parts
has been reprinted under the title of Socialism from Utopia to
Science The following quotation is taken from the translation prepared
for the People in 1892
We also find upon a closer enquiry that the two poles of an
antithesis such as positive and negative are as inseparable from as
they are opposed to each other and that despite their antagonism they
mutually pervade each other and in the same way we find cause and
effect to be conceptions whose force exists only when applied to a
single instance but which soon as we consider that instance in its
connection with the cosmos run into each other and dissolve in the
contemplation of that universal action and reaction where cause and
effect constantly change placesthat which is effect now and here
becoming then and yonder cause and vice versa
None of these processes and methods of reasoning fits in the
metaphysical framework of thought To dialectics however which takes
in the objects and their conceivable images above all in their
connections their sequence their motion their rise and decline
processes like the above are so many attestations of its own method of
procedure Nature furnishes the test to dialectics and this much we
must say for modern natural science that it has contributed towards
this test an extremely rich and daily increasing material whereby it
has demonstrated that in the last instance nature proceeds upon
dialectical not upon metaphysical methods that it does not move upon
the eternal sameness of a perpetually recurring circle but that it goes
through an actual historic evolution
This new German philosophy culminated in the system of Hegel There
for the first timeand herein consists its meritthe whole natural
historic and intellectual world was presented as a process i e
engaged in perpetual motion change transformation and development
Viewed from this standpoint the history of mankind no longer appeared
as a wild tangle of senseless deeds of violence all equally to be
rejected by a ripened philosophic judgment and which it were best to
forget as soon as possible but as the process of the development of
mankind itselfa development whose gradual march through all its stray
paths and its eternal law through all its seeming fortuitousness it
now became the task of the intellect to trace and to discover
Kirkup in his History of Socialism has this to say upon the
dialectic method of investigation as used by Marx In the system of
Marx it means that the business of enquiry is to trace the connection
and concatenation in the links that make up the process of historic
evolution to investigate how one stage succeeds another in the
development of society the facts and forms of human life and history
not being stable and stereotyped things but the everchanging
manifestations of the fluent and unresting real the course of which it
is the duty of science to reveal
The translator has endeavored to render the meaning of the original in
as simple an English form as possible and to generally speaking avoid
technical terms

AUTHORS PREFACE
In the preface of the Critique of Political Economy published at
Berlin in 1859 Marx explained how we two in 1845 in Brussels
intended to work out together the antagonism of our viewsthat is the
materialistic philosophy of history as developed by Marxto the
ideological German philosophy and in fact to compare it with our
present philosophic knowledge The design was carried out in the form of
a criticism of postHegelian philosophy The manuscript two big octavo
volumes had long been at its intended place of publication in
Westphalia when we received the news that altered circumstances did not
permit of its being printed We postponed the publication of the
manuscript indefinitely all the more willingly as we had attained our
main object an understanding of our own position
Since then more than forty years have elapsed and Marx has died
without either of us having had an opportunity of coming back to the
antithesis As regards our position with reference to Hegel we have
explained that as occasion has arisen but nowhere as a whole We
never came back to Feuerbach who occupies an intermediate position
between the philosophy of Hegel and our own
In the meantime the Marxian philosophy has found champions beyond the
boundaries of Germany and of Europe and in all the languages of the
civilized world On the other hand the classic German philosophy has
had a sort of newbirth abroad particularly in England and Scandinavia
and even in Germany they appear to be substituting the thin soup of
eclecticism which seems to flow from the universities under the name of
philosophy
Under these circumstances a short compact explanation of our relations
to the Hegelian philosophy of our going forth and departure from it
appears to me to be more and more required And just in the same way a
full recognition of the influence which Feuerbach more than all the
other postHegelian philosophers had over us during the period of our
youthful enthusiasm presents itself to me as an unendurable debt of
honor I also seize the opportunity the more readily since the editor of
the Neue Zeit has asked me for a critical discussion of Starckes book
on Feuerbach My work was published in the fourth and fifth volumes of
1886 of that publication and here appears in a revised special edition
Before sending this manuscript to press I once again hunted up and
examined the old manuscript of 18456 The part of it dealing with
Feuerbach is not complete The portion completed consists in an
exposition of the materialistic view of history and only proves how
incomplete at that time was our knowledge of economic history The
criticism of Feuerbachs doctrine is not given in it It was therefore
unsuitable for our purpose On the other hand I have found in an old
volume of Marx the eleven essays on Feuerbach printed here as an
appendix These are notes hurriedly scribbled in for later elaboration
not in the least degree prepared for the press but invaluable as the
first written form in which is planted the genial germ of the new
philosophy

The volume before us brings us at once to a period which in the matter
of time lies a full generation behind us but which is as foreign to
the present generation in Germany as if it were quite a century old
And still it was the period of the preparation of Germany for the
revolution of 1848 and all that has happened to us since is only a
continuation of 1848 only a carrying out of the last will and testament
of the revolution
Just as in France in the eighteenth so in Germany in the nineteenth
century revolutionary philosophic conceptions introduced a breaking up
of existing political conditions But how different the two appear The
French were engaged in open fight with all recognized science with the
Church frequently also with the State their writings were published
beyond the frontiers in Holland or in England and they themselves were
frequently imprisoned in the Bastile The Germans on the contrary were
professors appointed instructors of youth by the State their writings
recognized textbooks and their definite system of universal progress
the Hegelian raised as it were to the rank of a royal Prussian
philosophy of government And behind these professors behind their
pedantically obscure utterances in their heavy wearisome periods was
it possible that the revolution could conceal itself Were not just the
people who were looked upon at that time as the leaders of the
