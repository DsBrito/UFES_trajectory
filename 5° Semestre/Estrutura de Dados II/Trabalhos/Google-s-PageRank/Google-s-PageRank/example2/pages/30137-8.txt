announcement of this homecoming had been as unexpected as the news of
his marriage had been quite a year before
Let there be no guests assembledmy reasons will be made apparent to
you later on so read the telegram which puzzled the housekeeper
more than she cared to admit to the inquisitive maid who stood near
her curiously watching her thoughtful face
Pears to me it will rain afore they get here Hagar she said
nervously and as if in confirmation of her words a few raindrops
splashed against the windowpane
Both stood gazing intently out into the darkness The storm had now
commenced in earnest The great trees bent to and fro like reeds
before the wind the lightning flashed and the terrific crash of
roaring thunder mingled with the torrent of rain that beat furiously
against the casement It seemed as if the very floodgates of heaven
were flung open wide on this memorable night of the masters return
It is a fearful night Ah happy is the bride upon whose homecoming
the sunlight falls muttered Mrs Corliss under her breath
Hagar had caught the lowspoken words and in a voice that sounded
strange and weird like a warning she answered
Yes and unhappy is the bride upon whose homecoming raindrops
fall
How little they knew as they stood there of the terrible tragedythe
cruelest ever enactedthose grim silent walls of Whitestone Hall
were soon to witness in fulfillment of the strange prophecy Hagar
the maid had scarcely ceased speaking ere the door was flung violently
open and a child of some five summers rushed into the room her face
livid with passion and her dark gleaming eyes shining like baneful
stars before which the two women involuntarily quailed
What is this I hear she cried with wild energy glancing fiercely
from the one to the other Is it true what they tell memy father is
bringing home his bride
Pluma my child remonstrated Mrs Corliss feebly I
Dont Pluma me retorted the child clutching the deep crimson
passionroses from a vase at her side and trampling them ruthlessly
beneath her feet Answer me at once I sayhas he dared do it
Pluma Mrs Corliss advances toward her but the child turns her
darkly beautiful willful face toward her with an imperious gesture
Do not come a step nearer cried the child bitterly or I shall
fling myself from the window down on to the rocks below I shall never
welcome my fathers wife here and mark me both of you I hate her
she cried vehemently She shall rue the day that she was born
Mrs Corliss knew but too well the child would keep her word No
power save God could stay the turbulent current of the ungovernable
selfwill which would drag her on to her doom No human being could
hold in subjection the fierce untamed will of the beautiful youthful
tyrant
There had been strange rumors of the unhappiness of Basil Hurlhursts
former marriage No one remembered having seen her but once quite
five years before A beautiful woman with a little babe had suddenly
appeared at Whitestone Hall announcing herself as Basil Hurlhursts
wife There had been a fierce stormy interview and on that very
night Basil Hurlhurst took his wife and child abroad those who had
once seen the dark glorious scornful beauty of the womans face
never forgot it Two years later the master had returned alone with
the little child heavily draped in widowers weeds
The master of Whitestone Hall was young those who knew his story were
not surprised that he should marryhe could not go through life
alone still they felt a nameless pity for the young wife who was to
be brought to the home in which dwelt the child of his former wife
There would be bitter war to the end between them No one could tell
on which side the scales of mercy and justice would be balanced
At that instant through the raging of the fierce elements the sound
of carriage wheels smote upon their ears as the vehicle dashed rapidly
up the long avenue to the porch while in another instant the young
master half carrying the slight delicate figure that clung timidly
to his arm hurriedly entered the spacious parlor There was a short
consultation with the housekeeper and Basil Hurlhurst tenderly
lifting the slight burden in his strong powerful arms quickly bore
his wife to the beautiful apartments that had been prepared for her
In the excitement of the moment Pluma was quite forgotten for an
instant only she glanced bitterly at the sweet fair face resting
against her fathers shoulder framed in a mass of golden hair The
child clinched her small hands until she almost cried aloud with the
intense pain never once deigning a glance at her fathers face In
that one instant the evil seeds of a lifetime were sown strong as life
and more bitter than death
Turning hastily aside she sprung hurriedly down the long corridor and
out into the darkness and the storm never stopping to gain breath
until she had quite reached the huge ponderous gate that shut in the
garden from the dense thicket that skirted the southern portion of the
plantation She laughed a hard mocking laugh that sounded unnatural
from such childish lips as she saw a white hand hurriedly loop back
the silken curtains of her fathers window and saw him bend tenderly
over the goldenhaired figure in the armchair Suddenly the sound of
her own name fell upon her ear
Pluma whispered a low cautious voice and in the quick flashes of
lightning she saw a white haggard womans face pressed close against
the grating and two white hands were steadily forcing the rusty lock
There was no fear in the fiery rebellious heart of the dauntless
child
Go away you miserable beggarwoman she cried or I shall set the
hounds on you at once Do you hear me I say
Who are you questioned the woman in the same low guarded voice
The child threw her head back proudly her voice rising shrilly above
the wild warring of the elements as she answered
Know then I am Pluma the heiress of Whitestone Hall
The child formed a strange pictureher dark wild face so strangely
like the mysterious womans own standing vividly out against the
crimson lightning flashes her dark curls blown about the gypsylike
face the red lips curling scornfully her dark eyes gleaming
Pluma called the woman softly come here
How dare you a beggarwoman call me cried the child
furiously
Plumacomehereinstantly
There was a subtle something in the strangers voice that throbbed
through the childs pulses like leaping firea strange mysterious
influence that bound her heart and soul like the mesmeric influence
a serpent exerts over a fascinated dove Slowly hesitatingly this
child whose fiery will had never bowed before human power came
timidly forward step by step close to the iron gate against which
the womans face was pressed She stretched out her hand and it
rested for a moment on the childs dark curls
Pluma the gate is locked she said Do you know where the keys
are
No answered the child
They used to hang behind the pantry doora great bunch of them
Dont they hang there now
Yees
I thought so muttered the woman triumphantly Now listen Pluma
I want you to do exactly as I bid you I want you to go quickly and
quietly and bring me the longest and thinnest one You are not to
breathe one word of this to any living soul Do you understand
PlumaI command you to do it
Yes answered the child dubiously
Stay she called as the child was about to turn from her Why is
the house lighted up tonight
Again the reckless spirit of the child flashed forth
My father has brought home his bride she said Dont you see him
bending over her toward the third window yonder
The womans eyes quickly followed in the direction indicated
Was it a curse the woman muttered as she watched the fair goldenhaired
young girlwifes head resting against Basil Hurlhursts breast his
arms clasped lovingly about her
Go Pluma she commanded bitterly
Quickly and cautiously the child sped on her fatal errand through the
storm and the darkness A moment later she had returned with the key
which was to unlock a world of misery to so many lives
Promise me Pluma heiress of Whitestone Hall never to tell what you
have done or seen or heard tonight You must never dare breathe it
while you live Say you will never tell Pluma
No cried the child I shall never tell They might kill me but I
would never tell them
The next moment she was alone Stunned and bewildered she turned her
face slowly toward the house The storm did not abate in its fury
nightbirds flapped their wings through the storm overhead owls
shrieked in the distance from the swaying treetops yet the child
walked slowly home knowing no fear In the house lights were moving
to and fro while servants with bated breath and light footfalls
hurried through the long corridors toward her fathers room No one
seemed to notice Pluma in her dripping robe creeping slowly along by
their side toward her own little chamber
It was quite midnight when her father sent for her Pluma suffered him
to kiss her giving back no answering caress
I have brought some one else to you my darling he said See
Plumaa new mamma And see who elsea wee dimpled little sister
with golden hair like mammas and great blue eyes Little Evalia is
your sister dear Pluma must love her new mamma and sister for papas
sake
The dark frown on the childs face never relaxed and with an
impatient gesture her father ordered her taken at once from the
room
Suddenly the great bells of Whitestone Hall ceased pealing for the
joyous birth of Basil Hurlhursts daughter and bitter cries of a
strong man in mortal anguish rent the air No one had noticed how or
when the sweet goldenhaired young wife had died With a smile on her
lips she was dead with her tiny little darling pressed close to her
pulseless heart
But sorrow even as pitiful as death but rarely travels singly Dear
Heaven how could they tell the brokenhearted man who wept in such
agony beside the wife he had loved so well of another mighty sorrow
that had fallen upon him Who was there that could break the news to
him The tiny fairhaired infant had been stolen from their midst
They would have thanked God if it had been lying cold in death upon
its mothers bosom
Slowly throughout the long nightthat terrible night that was never
to be forgottenthe solemn bells pealed forth from the turrets of
Whitestone Hall echoing in their sound Unhappy is the bride the
rain falls on Most truly had been the fulfillment of the fearful
prophecy
Merciful God cried Mrs Corliss how shall I break the news to my
master The sweet little babe is gone
For answer Hagar bent quickly over her and breathed a few words in
her ear that caused her to cry out in horror and amaze
No one will ever know whispered Hagar it is the wisest course
The truth will lie buried in our own hearts and die with us
Six weeks from the night his goldenhaired wife had died Basil Hurlhurst
awoke to consciousness from the ravages of brainfeverawoke to a life
not worth the living Quickly Mrs Corliss the housekeeper was
sent for who soon entered the room leaning upon Hagars arm
My wife is He could not say more
Buried sir beneath yonder willow
And the babe he cried eagerly Dead answered Hagar softly
Both are buried in one grave
Basil Hurlhurst turned his face to the wall with a bitter groan
Heaven forgive themthe seeds of the bitterest of tragedies were
irrevocably sown
CHAPTER II
One bright May morning some sixteen years later the golden sunshine
was just putting forth its first crimson rays lighting up the
ivygrown turrets of Whitestone Hall and shining upon a little white
cottage nestling in a bower of green leaves far to the right of it
where dwelt John Brooks the overseer of the Hurlhurst plantation
For sixteen years the grand old house had remained closedthe
plantation being placed in charge of a careful overseer Once again
Whitestone Hall was thrown open to welcome the master Basil
Hurlhurst who had returned from abroad bringing with him his
beautiful daughter and a party of friends
The interior of the little cottage was astir with bustling activity
It was five oclock the chimes had played the hour the laborers were
going to the fields and the dairymaids were beginning their work
In the doorway of the cottage stood a tall angular woman shading
her flushed and heated face from the suns rays with her hand
Daisy Daisy she calls in a harsh rasping voice where are you
you goodfornothing lazy girl Come into the house directly I say
Her voice died away over the white stretches of waving cotton but no
Daisy came Heres a pretty go she cried turning into the room
where her brother sat calmly finishing his morning meal a pretty go
indeed I promised Miss Pluma those white mulls should be sent over to
her the first thing in the morning She will be in a towering rage
and no wonder and like enough youll lose your place John Brooks
and twill serve you right too for encouraging that lazy girl in her
idleness
Dont be too hard on little Daisy Septima answered John Brooks
timidly reaching for his hat She will have the dresses at the Hall
in good time Ill warrant
Too hard indeed thats just like you men no feeling for your poor
overworked sister so long as that girl has an easy life of it It was
a sorry day for me when your aunt Taiza died leaving this girl to
our care
A deep flush mantled John Brooks face but he made no retort while
Septima energetically piled the white fluted laces in the huge
basketpiled it full to the brim until her arm ached with the weight
of itthe basket which was to play such a fatal part in the truant
Daisys lifethe life which for sixteen short years had been so
monotonous
Over the cornfields half hid by the clover came a young girl tripping
lightly along John Brooks paused in the path as he caught sight of
her Poor innocent little Daisy he muttered half under his breath
as he gazed at her quite unseen
Transferred to canvas it would have immortalized a painter No wonder
the mans heart softened as he gazed He saw a glitter of golden
curls and the scarlet gleam of a mantlea young girl tall and
slender with rounded supple limbs and a figure graceful in every
line and curvewhile her arms bare to the elbow would have charmed
a sculptor Cheek and lips were a glowing rosy redwhile her eyes of
the deepest and darkest blue were the merriest that ever gazed up to
the summer sunshine
Suddenly from over the trees there came the sound of the great bell at
the Hall Daisy stood quite still in alarm
It is five oclock she cried What shall I do Aunt Septima will
be so angry with me she promised Miss Pluma her white dresses should
be at the Hall by five and it is that already
Poor little Daisy no wonder her heart throbbed painfully and the look
of fear deepened in her blue eyes as she sped rapidly up the path that
led to the little cottage where Septima grimly awaited her with
flushed face and flashing eyes
So she said harshly you are come at last are you and a pretty
fright you have given me You shall answer to Miss Pluma herself for
this I dare say you will never attempt to offend her a second time
Indeed Aunt Septima I never dreamed it was so late cried
conscious Daisy I was watching the sun rise over the cottonfields
and watching the dewdrops glittering on the corn thinking of the
beautiful heiress of Whitestone Hall I am so sorry I forgot about the
dresses
Hastily catching up the heavy basket she hurried quickly down the
path like a startled deer to escape the volley of wrath the
indignant spinster hurled after her
It was a beautiful morning no cloud was in the smiling heavens the
sun shone brightly and the great oak and cedartrees that skirted the
roadside seemed to thrill with the song of birds Butterflies spread
their light wings and coquetted with the fragrant blossoms and busy
hummingbees buried themselves in the heart of the crimson wild rose
The basket was very heavy and poor little Daisys hands ached with
the weight of it
If I might but rest for a few moments only she said to herself
eying the cool shady grass by the roadside Surely a moment or two
will not matter Oh dear I am so tired
She set the basket down on the cool green grass flinging herself
beside it beneath the grateful shade of a blossoming magnoliatree
resting her golden head against the basket of filmy laces that were to
adorn the beautiful heiress of whom she had heard so much yet never
seen and of whom every one felt in such awe
She looked wistfully at the great mansion in the distance thinking
how differently her own life had been
The soft wooing breeze fanned her cheeks tossing about her golden
curls in wanton sport It was so pleasant to sit there in the dreamy
silence watching the white fleecy clouds the birds and the flowers
it was little wonder the swiftwinged moments flew heedlessly by
Slowly the white lids drooped over the lightblue eyes the long
golden lashes lay against the rosy cheeks the ripe lips parted in a
smileall unheeded were the fluted lacesDaisy slept Oh cruel
breezeoh fatal wooing breeze to have infolded hapless Daisy in your
soft embrace
Over the hills came the sound of baying hounds followed by a quick
springy step through the crackling underbrush as a young man in
closefitting velvet huntingsuit and jaunty velvet cap emerged from
the thicket toward the main road
As he parted the magnolia branches the hound sprang quickly forward at
some object beneath the tree with a low hoarse growl
Down Towser down cried Rex Lyon leaping lightly over some
intervening brushwood What kind of game have we here Whew he
ejaculated surprisedly a young girl pretty as a picture and by
the eternal fast asleep too
Still Daisy slept on utterly unconscious of the handsome brown eyes
that were regarding her so admiringly
I have often heard of fairies but this is the first time I have ever
caught one napping under the trees I wonder who she is anyhow Surely
she can not be some drudging farmers daughter with a form and face
like that he mused suspiciously eying the basket of freshly
laundered laces against which the flushed cheeks and waving golden
hair rested
Just then his ludicrous position struck him forcibly
Come Towser he said it would never do for you and me to be
caught staring at this pretty woodnymph so rudely if she should by
chance awaken just now
Tightening the strap of his gamebag over his shoulder and
readjusting his velvet cap jauntily over his brown curls Rex was
about to resume his journey in the direction of Whitestone Hall when
the sound of rapidly approaching carriagewheels fell upon his ears
Realizing his awkward position Rex knew the wisest course he could
possibly pursue would be to screen himself behind the magnolia
branches until the vehicle should pass The next instant a pair of
prancing ponies attached to a basket phaeton in which sat a young
girl who held them well in check dashed rapidly up the road Rex
could scarcely repress an exclamation of surprise as he saw the
occupant was his young hostess Pluma Hurlhurst of Whitestone Hall
She drew rein directly in front of the sleeping girl and Rex Lyon
never forgot to his dying day the discordant laugh that broke from
her red lipsa laugh which caused poor Daisy to start from her
slumber in wild alarm scattering the snowy contents of the basket in
all directions
For a single instant their eyes metthese two girls whose lives were
to cross each other so strangelypoor Daisy like a frightened bird
as she guessed intuitively at the identity of the other Pluma
haughty derisive and scornfully mocking
You are the person whom Miss Brooks sent to Whitestone Hall with my
mull dresses some three hours since I presume May I ask what
detained you
Poor Daisy was quite crestfallen great teardrops trembled on her
long lashes How could she answer She had fallen asleep wooed by the
lulling breeze and the sunshine
The basket was so heavy she answered timidly and IIsat down
to rest a few moments and
Further explanation is quite unnecessary retorted Pluma sharply
gathering up the reins See that you have those things at the Hall
within ten minutes not an instant later
Touching the prancing ponies with her ivoryhandled whip the haughty
young heiress whirled leisurely down the road leaving Daisy with
flushed face and teardimmed eyes gazing after her
Oh dear I wish I had never been born she sobbed flinging herself
down on her knees and burying her face in the long cool grass No
one ever speaks a kind word to me but poor old Uncle John and even he
dare not be kind when Aunt Septima is near She might have taken this
heavy basket in her carriage sighed Daisy bravely lifting the heavy
burden in her delicate arms
That is just what I think muttered Rex Lyon from his place of
concealment savagely biting his lip
In another moment he was by her side
Pardon me he said deferentially raising his cap from his glossy
curls that basket is too heavy for your slender arms Allow me to
assist you
In a moment the young girl stood up and made the prettiest and most
graceful of courtesies as she raised to his a face he never forgot
Involuntarily he raised his cap again in homage to her youth and her
shy sweet beauty
No I thank you sir I have not far to carry the basket she
replied in a voice sweet as the chiming of silver bellsa voice that
thrilled him he could not tell why
A sudden desire possessed Rex to know who she was and from whence she
came
Do you live at the Hall he asked
No she replied I am Daisy Brooks the overseers niece
Daisy Brooks said Rex musingly What a pretty name how well it
suits you
He watched the crimson blushes that dyed her fair young faceshe
never once raised her darkblue eyes to his The more Rex looked at
her the more he admired this coy bewitching pretty little maiden
She made a fair picture under the boughs of the magnoliatree thick
with odorous pinkandwhite tinted blossoms the sunbeams falling on
her golden hair
The sunshine or the gentle southern wind brought Rex no warning he was
forging the first links of a dreadful tragedy He thought only of the
shy blushing beauty and coy grace of the young girlhe never dreamed
of the hour when he should look back to that moment wondering at his
own blind folly with a curse on his lips
Again from over the trees came the sound of the great bell from the
Hall
It is eight oclock cried Daisy in alarm Miss Pluma will be so
angry with me
Angry said Rex angry with you For what
She is waiting for the mull dresses replied Daisy
It was a strange idea to him that any one should dare be angry with
this pretty gentle Daisy
You will at least permit me to carry your basket as far as the gate
he said shouldering her burden without waiting for a reply Daisy had
no choice but to follow him There said Rex setting the basket
down by the plantation gate which they had reached all too soon you
must go I suppose It seems hard to leave the bright sunshine to go
indoors
II shall soon return said Daisy with innocent frankness
Shall you cried Rex Will you return home by the same path
Yes she replied if Miss Pluma does not need me
Goodbye Daisy he said I shall see you again
He held out his hand and her little fingers trembled and fluttered in
his clasp Daisy looked so happy yet so frightened so charming yet so
shy Rex hardly knew how to define the feeling that stirred in his
heart
He watched the graceful fairy figure as Daisy tripped awayinstead
of thinking he had done a very foolish thing that bright morning Rex
lighted a cigar and fell to dreaming of sweet little Daisy Brooks and
wondering how he should pass the time until he should see her again
While Daisy almost flew up the broad gravel path to the house the
heavy burden she bore seemed light as a featherno thought that she
had been imprudent ever entered her mind
There was no one to warn her of the peril which lay in the witching
depths of the handsome strangers glances
All her young life she had dreamed of the hero who would one day come
to her just such a dream as all youthful maidens experiencean idol
they enshrine in their innermost heart and worship in secret never
dreaming of a cold dark time when the idol may lie shattered in ruins
at their feet How little knew gentle Daisy Brooks of the fatal love
which would drag her down to her doom
CHAPTER III
In an elegant boudoir all crimson and gold some hours later sat
Pluma Hurlhurst reclining negligently on a satin divan toying idly
with a volume which lay in her lap She tossed the book aside with a
yawn turning her superb dark eyes on the little figure bending over
the rich trailing silks which were to adorn her own fair beauty on the
coming evening
So you think you would like to attend the lawn fete tonight Daisy
she asked patronizingly
Daisy glanced up with a startled blush
Oh I should like it so much Miss Pluma she answered hesitatingly
if I only could
I think I shall gratify you said Pluma carelessly You have made
yourself very valuable to me I like the artistic manner you have
twined these roses in my hair the effect is quite picturesque She
glanced satisfiedly at her own magnificent reflection in the
chevalglass opposite Titian alone could have reproduced those
rich marvelous colorsthat perfect queenly beauty He would have
painted the picture and the world would have raved about its beauty
The dark masses of ravenblack hair the proud haughty face with
its warm southern tints the dusky eyes lighted with fire and
passion and the red curved lips I wish particularly to look my
very best tonight Daisy she said that is why I wish you to
remain You can arrange those sprays of white heath in my hair
superbly Then you shall attend the fete Daisy Remember you are not
expected to take part in it you must sit in some secluded nook
where you will be quite unobserved
Pluma could not help but smile at the ardent delight depicted in
Daisys face
I am afraid I can not stay she said doubtfully glancing down in
dismay at the pinkandwhite muslin she wore Every one would be sure
to laugh at me who saw me Then I would wish I had not stayed
Suppose I should give you one to wearthat white mull for
instancehow would you like it None of the guests would see you
replied Pluma
There was a wistful look in Daisys eyes as though she would fain
believe what she heard was really true
Would you really asked Daisy wonderingly You whom people call
so haughty and so proudyou would really let me wear one of your
dresses I do not know how to tell you how much I am pleased she
said eagerly
Pluma Hurlhurst laughed Such rapture was new to her
The night which drew its mantle over the smiling earth was a perfect
one Myriads of stars shone like jewels in the blue sky and not a
cloud obscured the face of the clear full moon Hurlhurst Plantation
was ablaze with colored lamps that threw out soft rainbow tints in all
directions as far as the eye could reach The interior of Whitestone
Hall was simply dazzling in its rich rose bloom its lights its
fountains and rippling music from adjoining ferneries
In an elegant apartment of the Hall Basil Hurlhurst the recluse
invalid lay upon his couch trying to shut out the mirth and gayety
that floated up to him from below As the sound of Plumas voice
sounded upon his ear he turned his face to the wall with a bitter
groan She is so like he muttered grimly Ah the pleasant
voices of our youth turn into lashes which scourge us in our old age
Like mother like child
The lawn fete was a grand success the elite of the whole country
round were gathered together to welcome the beautiful peerless
hostess of Whitestone Hall Pluma moved among her guests like a queen
yet in all that vast throng her eyes eagerly sought one face Where
was Rex was the question which constantly perplexed her After the
first waltz he had suddenly disappeared Only the evening before
handsome Rex Lyon had held her jeweled hand long at parting
whispering in his graceful charming way he had something to tell
her on the morrow Why did he hold himself so strangely aloof Pluma
asked herself in bitter wonder Ah had she but known
While Pluma the wealthy heiress awaited his coming so eagerly Rex
Lyon was standing quite lost in thought beside a rippling fountain
in one of the most remote parts of the lawn thinking of Daisy Brooks
He had seen a fair facethat was alla face that embodied his dream
of loveliness and without thinking of it found his fate and the
whole world seemed changed for him
Handsome impulsive Rex Lyon owner of several of the most extensive
and lucrative orange groves in Florida would have bartered every
dollar of his worldly possessions for love
He had hitherto treated all notion of love in a very offhand
cavalier fashion
Love is fate he had always said He knew Pluma loved him Last
