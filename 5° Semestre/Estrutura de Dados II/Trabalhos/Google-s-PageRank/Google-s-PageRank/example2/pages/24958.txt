Except for the one thing they lack and thats quite odd they seem
exactly like us Is that what you wanted me to say
It is The fact that they are an incomplete version of ourselves
touches me They actually seem defenseless though I suppose theyre
not
Tough said Bal Nothing we can do about it
There is We can give them a week
In a week we cant negate their entire history We cant begin to undo
the effect of the big bomb
You cant tell said Ethaniel We can look things over
And then what How much authority do we have
Very little conceded Ethaniel Two minor officials on the way to
Willafoursand we run directly into a problem no one knew existed
And when we get to Willafours well be busy It will be a long time
before anyone comes this way again
A very long time Theres nothing in this region of space our people
want said Ethaniel And how long can Earth last Ten years Even ten
months The tension is building by the hour
What can I say said Bal I suppose we can stop and look them over
Were not committing ourselves by looking
They went much closer to Earth not intending to commit themselves For
a day they circled the planet avoiding radar detection which for them
was not difficult testing and sampling Finally Ethaniel looked up
from the monitor screen Any conclusions
Whats there to think Its worse than I imagined
In what way
Well we knew they had the big bomb Atmospheric analysis showed that
as far away as we were
I know
We also knew they could deliver the big bomb presumably by some sort
of aircraft
That was almost a certainty Theyd have no use for the big bomb
without aircraft
Whats worse is that I now find they also have missiles range one
thousand miles and upward They either have or are near a primitive form
of space travel
Bad said Ethaniel Sitting there wondering when its going to hit
them Nervousness could set it off
It could and the missiles make it worse said Bal What did you find
out at your end
Nothing worthwhile I was looking at the people while you were
investigating their weapons
You must think something
I wish I knew what to think Theres so little time Ethaniel said
Language isnt the difficulty Our machines translate their languages
easily and Ive taken a cram course in two or three of them But thats
not enough looking at a few plays listening to advertisements music
and news bulletins I should go down and live among them read books
talk to scholars work with them play
You could do that and youd really get to know them But that takes
timeand we dont have it
I realize that
A flat yes or no said Bal
No We cant help them said Ethaniel There is nothing we can do for
thembut we have to try
Sure I knew it before we started said Bal Its happened before We
take the trouble to find out what a people are like and when we cant
help them we feel bad Its going to be that way again He rose and
stretched Well give me an hour to think of some way of going at it
It was longer than that before they met again In the meantime the ship
moved much closer to Earth They no longer needed instruments to see it
The planet revolved outside the visionports The southern plains were
green coursed with rivers the oceans were blue and much of the
northern hemisphere was glistening white Ragged clouds covered the
pole and a dirty pall spread over the midregions of the north
I havent thought of anything brilliant said Ethaniel
Nor I said Bal Were going to have to go down there cold And it
will be cold
Yes Its their winter
I did have an idea said Bal What about going down as supernatural
beings
Hardly said Ethaniel A hundred years ago it might have worked
Today they have satellites They are not primitives
I suppose youre right said Bal I did think we ought to take
advantage of our physical differences
If we could Id be all for it But these people are rough and
desperate They wouldnt be fooled by anything that crude
Well youre calling it said Bal
All right said Ethaniel You take one side and I the other Well
tell them bluntly what theyll have to do if theyre going to survive
how they can keep their planet in one piece so they can live on it
Thatll go over big Advice is always popular
Cant help it Thats all we have time for
Special instructions
None We leave the ship here and go down in separate landing craft You
can talk with me any time you want to through our communications but
dont unless you have to
They cant intercept the beams we use
They cant and even if they did they wouldnt know what to do with our
language I want them to think that we dont need to talk things
over
I get it Makes us seem better than we are They think we know exactly
what were doing even though we dont
If were lucky theyll think that
Bal looked out of the port at the planet below Its going to be cold
where Im going You too Sure we dont want to change our plans and
land in the southern hemisphere Its summer there
Im afraid not The great powers are in the north They are the ones we
have to reach to do the job
Yeah but I was thinking of that holiday you mentioned Well be
running straight into it That wont help us any
I know they dont like their holidays interrupted It cant be helped
We cant wait until its over
Im aware of that said Bal Fill me in on that holiday anything I
ought to know Probably religious in origin That so
It was religious a long time ago said Ethaniel I didnt learn
anything exact from radio and TV Now it seems to be chiefly a time for
eating office parties and selling merchandise
I see It has become a business holiday
Thats a good description I didnt get as much of it as I ought to
have I was busy studying the people and theyre hard to pin down
I see I was thinking there might be some way we could tie ourselves in
with this holiday Make it work for us
If there is I havent thought of it
You ought to know Youre running this one Bal looked down at the
planet Clouds were beginning to form at the twilight edge I hate to
go down and leave the ship up here with no one in it
They cant touch it No matter how they develop in the next hundred
years they still wont be able to get in or damage it in any way
Its myself Im thinking about Down there alone
Ill be with you On the other side of the Earth
Thats not very close Id like it better if there were someone in the
ship to bring it down in a hurry if things get rough They dont think
much of each other I dont imagine theyll like aliens any better
They may be unfriendly Ethaniel acknowledged Now he switched a
monitor screen until he looked at the slope of a mountain It was
snowing and men were cutting small green trees in the snow Ive
thought of a trick
If it saves my neck Im for it
I dont guarantee anything said Ethaniel This is what I was
thinking of instead of hiding the ship against the sun where theres
little chance it will be seen well make sure that they do see it
Lets take it around to the night side of the planet and light it up
Say pretty good said Bal
They cant imagine that wed light up an unmanned ship said Ethaniel
Even if the thought should occur to them theyll have no way of
checking it Also they wont be eager to harm us with our ship shining
down on them
Thats thinking said Bal moving to the controls Ill move the ship
over where they can see it best and then Ill light it up Ill really
light it up
Dont spare power
Dont worry about that Theyll see it Everybody on Earth will see
it Later with the ship in position glowing against the darkness of
space pulsating with light Bal said You know I feel better about
this We may pull it off Lighting the ship may be just the help we
need
Its not we who need help but the people of Earth said Ethaniel
See you in five days With that he entered a small landing craft
which left a faintly luminescent trail as it plunged toward Earth As
soon as it was safe to do so Bal left in another craft heading for the
other side of the planet
And the spaceship circled Earth unmanned blazing and pulsing with
light No star in the winter skies of the planet below could equal it in
brilliancy Once a manmade satellite came near but it was dim and was
lost sight of by the people below During the day the ship was visible
as a bright spot of light At evening it seemed to burn through the
sunset colors
And the ship circled on bright shining seeming to be a little piece
clipped from the center of a star and brought near Earth to illuminate
it Never or seldom had Earth seen anything like it
In five days the two small landing craft that had left it arched up from
Earth and joined the orbit of the large ship The two small craft slid
inside the large one and doors closed behind them In a short time the
aliens met again
We did it said Bal exultantly as he came in I dont know how we did
it and I thought we were going to fail but at the last minute they came
through
Ethaniel smiled Im tired he said rustling
Me too but mostly Im cold said Bal shivering Snow Nothing but
snow wherever I went Miserable climate And yet you had me go out
walking after that first day
From my own experience it seemed to be a good idea said Ethaniel If
I went out walking one day I noticed that the next day the officials
were much more cooperative If it worked for me I thought it might help
you
It did I dont know why but it did said Bal Anyway this
agreement they made isnt the best but I think it will keep them from
destroying themselves
Its as much as we can expect said Ethaniel They may have small
wars after this but never the big one In fifty or a hundred years we
can come back and see how much theyve learned
Im not sure I want to said Bal Say whats an angel
Why
When I went out walking people stopped to look Some knelt in the snow
and called me an angel
Something like that happened to me said Ethaniel
I didnt get it but I didnt let it upset me said Bal I smiled at
them and went about my business He shivered again It was always
cold I walked out but sometimes I flew back I hope that was all
right
In the cabin Bal spread his great wings Renaissance painters had never
seen his like but knew exactly how he looked In their paintings they
had pictured him innumerable times
I dont think it hurt us that you flew said Ethaniel I did so
myself occasionally
But you dont know what an angel is
No I didnt have time to find out Some creature of their folklore I
suppose You know except for our wings theyre very much like
ourselves Their legends are bound to resemble ours
Sure said Bal Anyway peace on Earth

Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works
Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support
Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
