them that clear and crisp incisiveness of utterance which was supposed
hitherto to be untransferable to any other tongue
As regards the themes of these novelettes from which the present
collection is chiefly made up it was remarked at the time of their
first appearance that they hinted at a more serious purpose than their
style seemed to imply Who can read for instance Pharaoh which
in the original is entitled A Hall Mood without detecting the
revolutionary note which trembles quite audibly through the calm
and unimpassioned language There is bytheway a little touch of
melodrama in this tale which is very unusual with Kielland Romance
and Reality too is glaringly at variance with the conventional
romanticism in its satirical contributing of the prematrimonial and the
postmatrimonial view of love and marriage The same persistent tendency
to present the wrong side as well as the right sideand not as
literary goodmanners are supposed to prescribe ignore the formeris
obvious in the charming tale At the Fair where a little spice of
wholesome truth spoils the thoughtlessly festive mood and the squalor
the want the envy hate and greed which prudence and a regard for
business compel the performers to disguise to the public become the
more cruelly visible to the visitors of the little alleyway at the rear
of the tents In A Good Conscience the satirical note has a still more
serious ring but the same admirable selfrestraint which next to the
power of thought and expression is the happiest gift an authors fairy
godmother can bestow upon him saves Kielland from saying too muchfrom
enforcing his lesson by marginal comments a la George Eliot But he
must be obtuse indeed to whom this reticence is not more eloquent and
effective than a page of philosophical moralizing
Hopes Clad in April Green and The Battle of Waterloo the first and
the last tale in the Norwegian edition are more untinged with a moral
tendency than any of the foregoing The former is a mere jeu desprit
full of goodnatured satire on the calflove of very young people and
the amusing overestimate of our importance to which we are all at that
age peculiarly liable
As an organist with vaguelymelodious hints foreshadows in his prelude
the musical motifs which he means to vary and elaborate in his fugue
so Kielland lightly touched in these novelettes the themes which in
his later works he has struck with a fuller volume and power What he
gave in this little book was it light sketch of his mental physiognomy
from which perhaps his horoscope might be cast and his literary future
predicted
Though an aristocrat by birth and training he revealed a strong
sympathy with the toiling masses But it was a democracy of the brain I
should fancy rather than of the heart As I read the book twelve years
ago its tendency puzzled me considerably remembering as I did with
the greatest vividness the fastidious and elegant personality of the
author I found it difficult to believe that he was in earnest The
book seemed to me to betray the whimsical sansculottism of a man of
pleasure who when the ball is at an end sits down with his gloves
on and philosophizes on the artificiality of civilization and the
wholesomeness of honest toil An indigestion makes him a temporary
communist but a bottle of seltzer presently reconciles him to his lot
and restores the equilibrium of the universe He loves the people at a
distance can talk prettily about the sturdy son of the soil who is
the core and marrow of the nation etc but he avoids contact with
him and if chance brings them into contact he loves him with his
handkerchief to his nose
I may be pardoned for having identified Alexander Kielland with this
type with which I am very familiar and he convinced me presently that
I had done him injustice In his next book the admirable novel Garman
and Worse he showed that his democratic proclivities were something
more than a mood He showed that he took himself seriously and he
compelled the public to take him seriously The tendency which had only
flashed forth here and there in the novelettes now revealed its
whole countenance The authors theme was the life of the prosperous
bourgeoisie in the western coasttowns he drew their types with a hand
that gave evidence of intimate knowledge He had himself sprung from
one of these rich shipowning patrician families had been given every
opportunity to study life both at home and abroad and had accumulated
a fund of knowledge of the world which he had allowed quietly to grow
before making literary drafts upon it The same Gallic perspicacity
of style which had charmed in his first book was here in a heightened
degree and there was besides the same underlying sympathy with
progress and what is called the ideas of the age What mastery of
description what rich and vigorous colors Kielland had at his disposal
was demonstrated in such scenes as the funeral of Consul Garman and the
burning of the ship There was moreover a delightful autobiographical
note in the book particularly in boyish experiences of Gabriel Garman
Such things no man invents however clever such material no imagination
supplies however fertile Except Fritz Reuters Stavenhagen I know no
small town in fiction which is so vividly and completely individualized
and populated with such living and credible characters Take for
instance the two clergymen Archdeacon Sparre and the Rev Mr Martens
and it is not necessary to have lived in Norway in order to recognize
and enjoy the faithfulness and the artistic subtlety of these portraits
If they have a dash of satire which I will not undertake to deny it
is such delicate and wellbred satire that no one except the originals
would think of taking offence People are willing for the sake of the
entertainment which it affords to forgive a little quiet malice at
their neighbors expense The members of the provincial bureaucracy are
drawn with the same firm but delicate touch and everything has that
beautiful air of reality which proves the world akin
It was by no means a departure from his previous style and tendency
which Kielland signalized in his next novel Laboring People 1881
He only emphasizes as it were the heavy serious bass chords in the
composite theme which expresses his complex personality and allows the
lighter treble notes to be momentarily drowned Superficially speaking
there is perhaps a reminiscence of Zola in this book not in the manner
of treatment but in the subject which is the corrupting influence of
the higher classes upon the lower There is no denying that in spite
of the ability which it betrays in every line Laboring People is
unpleasant reading It frightened away a host of the authors early
admirers by the uncompromising vigor and the glaring realism with
which it depicted the consequences of vicious indulgence It showed
no consideration for delicate nerves but was for all that a clean and
wholesome book
Kiellands third novel Skipper Worse marked a distinct step in his
development It was less of a social satire and more of a social study
It was not merely a series of brilliant exquisitelyfinished scenes
loosely strung together on a slender thread of narrative but it was
a concise and well constructed story full of beautiful scenes
and admirable portraits The theme is akin to that of Daudets
LEvangeliste but Kielland as it appears to me has in this instance
outdone his French confrere as regards insight into the peculiar
character and poetry of the pietistic movement He has dealt with it
as a psychological and not primarily as a pathological phenomenon A
comparison with Daudet suggests itself constantly in reading Kielland
Their methods of workmanship and their attitude towards life have many
points in common The charm of style the delicacy of touch and felicity
of phrase is in both cases preeminent Daudet has however the
advantage or as he himself asserts the disadvantage of working in
a flexible and highlyfinished language which bears the impress of the
labors of a hundred masters while Kielland has to produce his effects
of style in a poorer and less pliable language which often pants and
groans in its efforts to render a subtle thought To have polished this
tongue and sharpened its capacity for refined and incisive utterance is
oneand not the leastof his merits
Though he has by nature no more sympathy with the pietistic movement
than Daudet Kielland yet manages to get psychologically closer to his
problem His pietists are more humanly interesting than those of
Daudet and the little drama which they set in motion is more genuinely
pathetic Two superb figuresthe lay preacher Hans Nilsen and Skipper
Worsesurpass all that the author had hitherto produced in depth of
conception and brilliancy of execution The marriage of that delightful
profane old seadog Jacob Worse with the pious Sara Torvested and the
attempts of his motherinlaw to convert him are described not with
the merely superficial drollery to which the subject invites but with a
sweet and delicate humor which trembles on the verge of pathos
The beautiful story Elsie which though published separately is
scarcely a fullgrown novel is intended to impress society with a sense
of responsibility for its outcasts While Bjornstjerne Bjornson is fond
of emphasizing the responsibility of the individual to society Kielland
chooses by preference to reverse the relation The former in his
remarkable novel Flags are Flying in City and Harbor selects a
hero with vicious inherited tendencies redeemed by wise education and
favorable environment the latter portrays in Elsie a heroine with no
corrupt predisposition destroyed by the corrupting environment which
society forces upon those who are born in her circumstances Elsie could
not be good because the world is so constituted that girls of her kind
are not expected to be good Temptations perpetually thronging in her
way break down the moral bulwarks of her nature Resistance seems in
vain In the end there is scarcely one who having read her story will
have the heart to condemn her
Incomparably clever is the satire on the benevolent societies which
appear to exist as a sort of moral poultice to tender consciences and
to furnish an officious sense of virtue to its prosperous members The
Society for the Redemption of the Abandoned Women of St Peters Parish
is presided over by a gentleman who privately furnishes subjects for his
public benevolence However as his private activity is not bounded by
the precincts of St Peters Parish within which the society confines
its remedial labors the miserable creatures who might need its aid
are sent away uncomforted The delicious joke of the thing is that St
Peters is a rich and exclusive parish consisting of what is called
the better classes and has no abandoned women Whatever wickedness
there may be in St Peters is discreetly veiled and makes no claim
upon public charity The virtuous horror of the secretary when she
hears that the abandoned woman who calls upon her for aid has a child
though she is unmarried is both comic and pathetic It is the clean
deserving poor who understand the art of hypocritical humilityit is
these whom the society seeks in vain in St Peters Parish
Still another problem of the most vital consequence Kielland has
attacked in his two novels Poison and Fortuna 1884 It is
broadly stated the problem of education The hero in both books is
Abraham Lovdahl a wellendowed healthy and altogether promising boy
who by the approved modern educational process is mentally and
morally crippled and the germs of what is great and good in him are
systematically smothered by that disrespect for individuality and
insistence upon uniformity which are the curses of a small society
The revolutionary discontent which vibrates in the deepest depth of
Kiellands nature the profound and uncompromising radicalism which
smoulders under his polished exterior the philosophical pessimism
which relentlessly condemns all the flimsy and superficial reformatory
movements of the day have found expression in the history of the
childhood youth and manhood of Abraham Lvdahl In the first place it
is worthy of note that to Kielland the knowledge which is offered in
the guise of intellectual nourishment is poison It is the dry and dusty
accumulation of antiquarian lore which has little or no application
to modern lifeit is this which the young man of the higher classes is
required to assimilate Apropos of this let me quote Dr G Brandes
who has summed up the tendency of these two novels with great felicity
The author has surveyed the generation to which he himself belongs and
after having scanned these wide domains of emasculation these prairies
of spiritual sterility these vast plains of servility and irresolution
he has addressed to himself the questions How does a whole generation
become such How was it possible to nip in the bud all that was
fertile and eminent And he has painted a picture of the history of the
development of the present generation in the homelife and schoollife
of Abraham Lovdahl in order to show from what kind of parentage those
most fortunately situated and best endowed have sprung and what kind
of education they received at home and in the school This is indeed a
simple and an excellent theme
We first see the child led about upon the wide and withered common
of knowledge with the same sort of meagre fodder for all we see it
trained in mechanical memorizing in barren knowledge concerning things
and forms that are dead and gone in ignorance concerning the life
that is in contempt for it and in the consciousness of its privileged
position by dint of its possession of this doubtful culture We see
pride strengthened the healthy curiosity the desire to ask questions
killed
We are apt to console ourselves on this side of the ocean with the idea
that these social problems appertain only to the effete monarchies of
Europe and have no application with us But though I readily admit
that the keenest point of this satire is directed against the small
States which by the tyranny of the dominant mediocrity cripple much
that is good and great by denying it the conditions of growth and
development there is yet a deep and abiding lesson in these two novels
which applies to modern civilization in general exposing glaring
defects which are no less prevalent here than in the Old World
Besides being the author of some minor comedies and a fullgrown drama
The Professor Kielland has published two more novels St Johns
Eve 1887 and Snow The latter is particularly directed against
the orthodox Lutheran clergy of which the Rev Daniel Jurges is an
excellent specimen He is in my opinion not in the least caricatured
but portrayed with a conscientious desire to do justice to his
sincerity Mr Jurges is a worthy type of the Norwegian country pope
proud and secure in the feeling of his divine authority passionately
hostile to the age because he believes it to be hostile to Christ
intolerant of dissent a guide and ruler of men a shepherd of the
people The only trouble in Norway as elsewhere is that the people
will no longer consent to be shepherded They refuse to be guided and
ruled They rebel against spiritual and secular authority and follow
no longer the bellwether with the timid gregariousness of servility and
irresolution To bring the new age into the parsonage of the reverend
obscurantist in the shape of a young girlthe fiancee of the pastors
sonwas an interesting experiment which gives occasion for strong
scenes and at last for a drawn battle between the old and the new The
new though not acknowledging itself to be beaten takes to its heels
and flees in the stormy night through wind and snow But the snow is
moist and heavy it is beginning to thaw There is a vague presentiment
of spring in the air
This note of promise and suspense with which the book ends is meant to
be symbolic From Kiellands point of view Norway is yet wrapped in the
wintry windingsheet of a tyrannical orthodoxy and all that he dares
assert is that the chains of frost and snow seem to be loosening There
is a spring feeling in the air
This spring feeling is however scarcely perceptible in his last book
Jacob which is written in anything but a hopeful mood It is rather
a protest against that optimism which in fiction we call poetic justice
The harsh and unsentimental logic of reality is emphasized with a
ruthless disregard of rosecolored traditions The peasant lad Wold
who like all Norse peasants has been brought up on the Bible has
become deeply impressed with the story of Jacob and Gods persistent
partisanship for him in spite of his dishonesty and tricky behavior
The story becomes half unconsciously the basis of his philosophy of
life and he undertakes to model his career on that of the Biblical
hero He accordingly cheats and steals with a clever moderation and in
a cautious and circumspect manner which defies detection Step by step
he rises in the regard of his fellowcitizens crushes with longheaded
calculation or with brutal promptness as it may suit his purpose
all those who stand in his way and arrives at last at the goal of his
desires He becomes a local magnate a member of parliament where he
poses as a defender of the simple oldfashioned orthodoxy is decorated
by the King and is an object of the envious admiration of his fellow
townsmen
From the pedagogic point of view I have no doubt that Jacob would be
classed as an immoral book But the question of its morality is of
less consequence than the question as to its truth The most modern
literature which is interpenetrated with the spirit of the age has a
way of asking dangerous questionsquestions before which the reader
when he perceives their full scope stands aghast Our old idyllic faith
in the goodness and wisdom of all mundane arrangements has undoubtedly
received a shock from which it will never recover Our attitude towards
the universe is changing with the change of its attitude towards us
What the thinking part of humanity is now largely engaged in doing is to
readjust itself towards the world and the world towards it Success is
but a complete adaptation to environment and success is the supreme
aim of the modern man The authors who by their fearless thinking
and speaking help us towards this readjustment should in my opinion
whether we choose to accept their conclusions or not be hailed as
benefactors It is in the ranks of these that Alexander Kielland has
taken his place and now occupies a conspicuous position
HJALMAR HJORTH BOYESEN
NEW YORK May 15 1891
PHARAOH
She had mounted the shining marble steps with without mishap without
labor sustained by her great beauty and her fine nature alone She had
taken her place in the salons of the rich and great without laying for
her admittance with her honor or her good name Yet no one could say
whence she came though people whispered that it was from the depths
As a waif of a Parisian faubourg she had starved through her childhood
among surroundings of vice and poverty such as those only can conceive
who know them by experience Those of us who get our knowledge from
books and from hearsay have to strain our imagination in order to form
an idea of the hereditary misery of a great city and yet our most
terrible imaginings are apt to pale before the reality
It had been only a question of time when vice should get its clutches
upon her as a cogwheel seizes whoever comes too near the machine
After whirling her around through a short life of shame and degradation
it would with mechanical punctuality have cast her off into some
corner there to drag out to the end in sordid obscurity her
caricature of an existence
But it happened as it does sometimes happen that she was discovered
by a man of wealth and position one day when a child of fourteen she
happened to cross one of the better streets She was on her way to a
dark back room in the Rue des Quatre Vents where she worked with a
woman who made artificial flowers
It was not only her extraordinary beauty that attracted her patron
her movements her whole bearing and the expression of her halfformed
features all seemed to him to show that here was an originally fine
nature struggling against incipient corruption Moved by one of the
incalculable whims of the very wealthy he determined to try to rescue
the unhappy child
It was not difficult to obtain control of her as she belonged to no
one He gave her a name and placed her in one of the best convent
schools Before long her benefactor had the satisfaction of observing
that the seeds of evil died away and disappeared She developed an
amiable rather indolent character correct and quiet manners and a
rare beauty
When she grew up he married her Their married life was peaceful
and pleasant in spite of the great difference in their ages he had
unbounded confidence in her and she deserved it
Married people do not live in such close communion in France as they
do with us so that their claims upon each other are not so great and
their disappointments are less bitter
She was not happy but contented Her character lent itself to
gratitude She did not feel the tedium of wealth on the contrary she
often took an almost childish pleasure in it But no one could guess
that for her bearing was always full of dignity and repose People
suspected that there was something questionable about her origin but as
no one could answer questions they left off asking them One has so much
else to think of in Paris
She had forgotten her past She had forgotten it just as we
have forgotten the roses the ribbons and faded letters of our
youthbecause we never think about them They lie locked up in a drawer
which we never open And yet if we happen now and again to cast a
glance into this secret drawer we at once notice if a single one of the
roses or the least bit of ribbon is wanting For we remember them all
to a nicety the memories are ran fresh as everas sweet as ever and
as bitter
It was thus she had forgotten her pastlocked it up and thrown away the
key
But at night she sometimes dreamed frightful things She could once more
feel the old witch with whom she lived shaking her by the shoulder and
driving her out in the cold mornings to work at her artificial flowers
Then she would jump up in her bed and stare out into the darkness in
the most deadly fear But presently she would touch the silk coverlet
and the soft pillows her fingers would follow the rich carvings of her
luxurious bed and while sleepy little childangels slowly drew aside
the heavy dreamcurtain she tasted in deep draughts the peculiar
indescribable wellbeing we feel when we discover that an evil and
horrible dream was a dream and nothing more
Leaning back among the soft cushions she drove to the great ball at
the Russian ambassadors The nearer they got to their destination the
slower became the pace until the carriage reached the regular queue
where it dragged on at a footpace
In the wide square in front of the hotel brilliantly lighted with
torches and with gas a great crowd of people had gathered Not only
passersby who had stopped to look on but more especially workmen
loafers poor women and ladies of questionable appearance stood in
serried ranks on both sides of the row of carriages Humorous remarks
and coarse witticisms in the vulgarest Parisian dialect hailed down upon
the passing carriages and their occupants
She heard words which she had not heard for many years and she blushed
at the thought that she was perhaps the only one in this whole long line
of carriages who understood these low expressions of the dregs of Paris
She began to look at the faces around her it seemed to her as if she
knew them all She knew what they thought what was passing in each
of these tightlypacked heads and little by little a host of memories
streamed in upon her She fought against them as well as she could but
she was not herself this evening
She had not then lost the key to the secret drawer reluctantly she
drew it out and the memories overpowered her
She remembered how often she herself still almost a child had devoured
with greedy eyes the fine ladies who drove in splendor to balls or
theatres how often she had cried in bitter envy over the flowers she
laboriously pieced together to make others beautiful Here she saw the
same greedy eyes the same inextinguishable savage envy
And the dark earnest men who scanned the equipages with
halfcontemptuous halfthreatening looksshe knew them all
Had not she herself as a little girl lain in a corner and listened
wideeyed to their talk about the injustice of life the tyranny of the
rich and the rights of the laborer which he had only to reach out his
hand to seize
She knew that they hated everythingthe sleek horses the dignified
coachmen the shining carriages and most of all the people who sat
within themthese insatiable vampires these ladies whose ornaments
for the night cost more gold than any one of them could earn by the work
of a whole lifetime
And as she looked along the line of carriages as it dragged on
slowly through the crowd another memory flashed into her minda
halfforgotten picture from her schoollife in the convent
She suddenly came to think of the story of Pharaoh and his warchariots
following the children of Israel through the Red Sea She saw the waves
which she had always imagined red as blood piled up like a wall on both
sides of the Egyptians
Then the voice of Moses sounded He stretched out his staff over the
waters and the Red Sea waves hurtled together and swallowed up Pharaoh
and all his chariots
She knew that the wall which stood on each side of her was wilder and
more rapacious than the waves of the sea she knew that it needed only
a voice a Moses to set all this human sea in motion hurling it
irresistibly onward until it should sweep away all the glory of wealth
and greatness in its bloodred waves
Her heart throbbed and she crouched trembling into the corner of the
carriage But it was not with fear it was so that those without should
not see herfor she was ashamed to meet their eyes
For the first time in her life her goodfortune appeared to her in the
light of an injustice a thing to blush for
Was she in her right place in this softcushioned carriage among these
tyrants and bloodsuckers Should she not rather be out there in the
billowing mass among the children of hate
Halfforgotten thoughts and feelings thrust up their heads like beasts
of prey which have long lain bound She felt strange and homeless in
her glittering life and thought with a sort of demoniac longing of the
horrible places from which she had risen
She seized her rich lace shawl there came over her a wild desire to
destroy to tear something to pieces but at this moment the carriage
turned into the gateway of the hotel
The footman tore open the door and with her gracious smile her air of
quiet aristocratic distinction she alighted
A young attache rushed forward and was happy when she took his arm
still more enraptured when he thought he noticed an unusual gleam in her
eyes and in the seventh heaven when he felt her arm tremble
Full of pride and hope he led her with sedulous politeness up the
shining marble steps
Tell me belle dame what good fairy endowed you in your cradle with
the marvellous gift of transforming everything you touch into something
new and strange The very flower in your hair has a charm as though
it were wet with the fresh morning dew And when you dance it seems as
though the floor swayed and undulated to the rhythm of your footsteps
The Count was himself quite astonished at this long and felicitous
compliment for as a rule he did not find it easy to express himself
coherently He expected too that his beautiful partner would show her
appreciation of his effort
But he was disappointed She leaned over the balcony where they were
enjoying the cool evening air after the dance and gazed out over
the crowd and the stilladvancing carriages She seemed not to have
understood the Counts great achievement at least he could only hear
her whisper the inexplicable word Pharaoh
He was on the point of remonstrating with her when she turned round
made a step towards the salon stopped right in front of him and looked
him in the face with great wonderful eyes such as the Count had never
seen before
I scarcely think Monsieur le Comte that any good fairyperhaps
not even a cradlewas present at my birth But in what you say of
my flowers and my dancing your penetration has led you to a great
discovery I will tell you the secret of the fresh morning dew which
lies on the flowers It is the tears Monsieur le Comte which envy and
shame disappointment and remorse have wept over them And if you seem
to feel the floor swaying as we dance that is because it trembles under
the hatred of millions
She had spoken with her customary repose and with a friendly bow she
disappeared into the salon
The Count remained rooted to the spot He cast a glance over the crowd
outside It was a right he had often seen and he had made sundry snore
or less trivial witticisms about the manyheaded monster But tonight
it struck him for the first time that this monster was after all the
most unpleasant neighbor for a palace one could possibly imagine
Strange and disturbing thoughts whirled in the brain of Monsieur le
Comte where they found plenty of space to gyrate He was entirely
thrown off his balance and it was not till after the next polka that
his placidity returned
THE PARSONAGE
It seemed as though the spring would never come All through April the
north wind blew and the nights were frosty In the middle of the day the
sun shone so warmly that a few big flies began to buzz around and the
lark proclaimed on its word of honor that it was the height of summer
But the lark is the most untrustworthy creature under heaven However
much it might freeze at night the frost was forgotten at the first
sunbeam and the lark soared singing high over the heath until it
bethought itself that it was hungry
Then it sank slowly down in wide circles singing and beating time to
its song with the flickering of its wings But a little way from
the earth it folded its wings and dropped like a stone down into the
heather
The lapwing tripped with short steps among the hillocks and nodded its
head discreetly It had no great faith in the lark and repeated its
wary Bi litt Bi litt Note Wait a bit Wait a bit Pronounced
Bee leet A couple of mallards lay snuggling in a marshhole and the
elder one was of opinion that spring would not come until we had rain
Far on into May the meadows were still yellow only here and there on
the sunny leas was there any appearance of green But if you lay down
upon the earth you could see a multitude of little shootssome thick
others as thin as green darningneedleswhich thrust their heads
cautiously up through the mould But the north wind swept so coldly over
them that they turned yellow at the tips and looked as if they would
like to creep back again
But that they could not do so they stood still and waited only
sprouting ever so little in the midday sun
The mallard was right it was rain they wanted And at last it
camecold in the beginning but gradually warmer and when it was over
the sun came out in earnest And now you would scarcely have known
it again it shone warmly right from the early morning till the late
evening so that the nights were mild and moist
Then an immense activity set in everything was behindhand and had to
make up for lost time The petals burst from the full buds with a little
crack and all the big and little shoots made a sudden rush They darted
out stalks now to the one side now to the other as quickly as though
they lay kicking with green legs The meadows were spangled with flowers
and weeds and the heather slopes towards the sea began to light up
Only the yellow sand along the shore remained as it was it has no
