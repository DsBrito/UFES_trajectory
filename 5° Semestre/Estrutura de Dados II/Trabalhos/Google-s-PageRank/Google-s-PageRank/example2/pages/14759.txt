FOREWORD
The author has conducted boys camps for twentythree years so that he is
not without experience in the subject To share with others this
experience has been his aim in writing the book The various chapters have
been worked out from a practical viewpoint the desire being to make a
handbook of suggestions for those in charge of camps for boys and for boys
who go camping rather than a theoretical treatise upon the general
subject

Every leader before going to camp should read some book upon boy life
in order not only that he may refresh his memory regarding his own
boyhood days but that he may also the more intelligently fit himself for
the responsibility of leadership The following books or similar ones
may be found in any wellequipped library
If this book will help some man to be of greater service to boys as well
as to inspire boys to live the noble life which Gods great outofdoors
teaches the author will feel amply repaid for his labor Boston Mass

INFLUENCE OF CAMP LIFE
It is great fun to live in the glorious open air fragrant with the smell
of the woods and flowers it is fun to swim and fish and hike it over the
hills it is fun to sit about the open fire and spin yarns or watch in
silence the glowing embers but the greatest fun of all is to win the love
and confidence of some boy who has been a trouble to himself and everybody
else and help him to become a manH M Burr
The summer time is a period of moral deterioration with most boys Free
from restraint of school and many times of home boys wander during the
vacation time into paths of wrongdoing largely because of a lack of
directed play life and a natural outlet for the expenditure of their
surplus energy The vacation problem therefore becomes a serious one for
both the boy and his parent Camping offers a solution
The Need
A boy in the process of growing needs the outdoors He needs room and
range He needs the tonic of the hills the woods and streams He needs to
walk under the great sky and commune with the stars He needs to place
himself where nature can speak to him He ought to get close to the soil
He ought to be toughened by sun and wind rain and cold Nothing can take
the place for the boy of stout physique robust health good blood firm
muscles sound nerves for these are the conditions of character and
efficiency The early teens are the most important years for the boy
physically Through the ages of thirteen and fifteen the more he can be
in the open free from social engagements and from continuous labor or
study the better He should fish swim row and sail roam the woods and
the waters get plenty of vigorous action have interesting healthful
things to think aboutProf C W Votaw
The Purpose
This is the real purpose of campingsomething to do something to think
about something to enjoy in the woods with a view always to
characterbuildingthis is the way Ernest ThompsonSeton that master
woodcraftsman puts it Character building What a great objective It
challenges the best that is in a man or boy Camping is an experience not
an institution It is an experience which every live fullblooded
growing boy longs for and happy the day of his realization At the first
sign of spring back yards blossom forth with tents of endless variety To
sleep out to cook food to search for natures fascinating secrets to
make thingsall are but the expression of that instinct for freedom of
living in the great outofdoors which God created within him
Too Much House
Too much house says Jacob Riis Civilization has been making of the
world a hothouse Mans instinct of selfpreservation rebels hence the
appeal for the return to the simple life that is growing loud Boys need
to get away from the schoolroom and books and may I say the martyrdom of
examinations high marks promotions and exhibitions Medical examinations
of school children reveal some startling facts Why should boys suffer
from nerves Are we sacrificing bodily vigor for abnormal intellectual
growth Have we been fighting against instead of cooperating with nature
The tide is turning however and the people are living more and more in
the open Apostles of outdoor life like Henry D Thoreau John Burroughs
William Hamilton Gibson Howard Henderson Ernest ThompsonSeton Frank
Beard Horace Kephart Edward Breck Charles Stedman Hanks Stewart Edward
White Nessmuck W C Gray and a host of others have through their
writings arrested the thought of busy people long enough to have them see
the error of their ways and are bringing them to repentance
Camps for boys are springing up like mushrooms Literally thousands of
boys who have heretofore wasted the glorious summer time loafing on the
city streets or as disastrously at summer hotels or amusement places are
now living during the vacation time under natures canopy of blue with
only enough covering for protection from rain and wind and absorbing
through the pores of their body that vitality which only pure air
sunshine long hours of sleep wholesome food and reasonable discipline
can supply
Character Building
In reading over scores of booklets and prospectuses of camps for boys one
is impressed with their unanimity of purposethat of character building
These are a few quotations taken from a variety of camp booklets
The object of the camp is healthful recreation without temptation
A camp where boys live close to nature give themselves up to play
acquire skill in sports eat plenty of wholesome food and sleep long
hours  and are taught high ideals for their own lives
To give boys a delightful summer outing under favorable conditions and
to give them every opportunity to become familiar with camp life in all
its phases We believe this contributes much to the upbuilding of a boys
character and enables him to get out of life much enjoyment that would not
otherwise be possible
A place where older boys boys of the restless age may live a happy
carefree outdoor life free from the artificialities and pernicious
influences of the larger cities a place where all the cravings of a
real boy are satisfied a place where constant association with
agreeable companions and the influence of wellbred college men in a clean
and healthy moral atmosphere make for noble manhood a place where
athletic sports harden the muscles tan the skin broaden the shoulders
brighten the eye and send each lad back to his school work in the fall as
brown as a berry and as hard as nails
A camp of ideals not a summer hotel nor a supplanter of the home The
principal reason for its existence is the providing of a safe place for
parents to send their boys during the summer vacation where under the
leadership of Christian men they may be developed physically mentally
socially and morally
Whether the camp is conducted under church settlement Young Mens
Christian Association or private auspices the prime purpose of its
existence should be that of character building
Because of natural physical social educational moral and religious
conditions the boy is taught those underlying principles which determine
character The harder things a boy does or endures the stronger man he
will become the more unselfish and noble things he does the better man
he will become
No Roughhouse
The day of the extreme roughhouse camp has passed Boys have discovered
that real fun does not mean hurting or discomforting others but consists
in making others happy The boy who gets the most out of camp is the boy
who puts the most into camp
Mottoes
Many camps build their program of camp activities around a motto
such as
Each for All and All for Each
Help the Other Fellow
Do Your Best
Nothing Without Labor
A Gentleman Always and
I Can and I Will
Scout Law
Endurance selfcontrol selfreliance and unselfishness are taught the
Boy Scouts through what is called the Scout Law
1 A Scouts honor is to be trusted
2 Be loyal
3 Do a good turn to somebody every day
4 Be a friend to all
5 Be courteous
6 Be a friend to animals
7 Be obedient
8 Be cheerful
9 Be thrifty
All these are valuable because they contribute to the making of
character
In the conduct of a boys camp there must be a definite clearcut purpose
if satisfactory results are to be obtained A goasyouplease or
doasyou please camp will soon become a place of harm and moral
deterioration
Results
Camping should give to the boy that selfreliance which is so essential in
the making of a life that faith in others which is the foundation of
society that spirit of altruism which will make him want to be of service
in helping other fellows that consciousness of God as evidenced in His
handiwork which will give him a basis of morality enduring and
reasonable and a spirit of reverence for things sacred and eternal He
ought to have a better appreciation of his home after a season away from
what should be to him the sweetest place on earth
CHAPTER IILEADERSHIP
THE DIRECTOR
ASSISTANT LEADERS
THE TERM LEADER
HOW TO GET LEADERS
VARIETY OF TALENT
SUGGESTIONS TO LEADERS
OPPORTUNITY OF LEADERSHIP
The success or failure of a boys camp depends upon leadership rather than
upon equipment Boys are influenced by example rather than by precept A
boys camp is largely built around a strong personality Solve the problem
of leadership and you solve the greatest problem of camping
The Director
No matter how large or how small the camp there must be one who is in
absolute control He may be known as the director superintendent or
leader His word is final He should be a man of executive ability and
good common sense He should have a keen appreciation of justice A desire
to be the friend and counsellor of every boy must always govern his
action He will always have the interest and welfare of every individual
boy at heart realizing that parents have literally turned over to his
care and keeping for the time being the bodies and souls of their boys
To be respected should be his aim Too often the desire to be popular
leads to failure
Leaders
Aim to secure as assistant leaders or counsellors young men of
unquestioned character and moral leadership college men if possible men
of culture and refinement who are good athletes and who understand boy
life
They should be strong and sympathetic companionable men Too much care
cannot be exercised in choosing assistants Beware of effeminate men men
who are morbid in sex matters An alert leader can spot a crooked man by
his actions his glances and by his choice of favorites Deal with a man
of this type firmly promptly and quietly Let him suddenly be called
home by circumstances which he could not control The leader must have
the loyalty of his assistants They should receive their rank from the
leader and this rank should be recognized by the entire camp The highest
ranking leader present at any time should have authority over the party
In a boys camp I prefer the term leader to that of counsellor It is
more natural for a boy to follow a leader than to listen to wise
counsellors Come on fellows lets meets with hearty response
Boys do this is an entirely different thing Leaders should hold
frequent councils regarding the life of the camp and share in determining
its policy
The most fruitful source of supply of leaders should be the colleges and
preparatory schools No vacation can be so profitably spent as that given
over to the leadership of boy life Here is a form of altruistic service
which should appeal to purposeful college men Older high school boys who
have been campers make excellent leaders of younger boys A leader should
always receive some remuneration for his services either carfare and
board or a fixed sum of money definitely agreed upon beforehand The pay
should never be so large that he will look upon his position as a job
Never cover service with the blinding attractiveness of money The chief
purpose of pay should be to help deepen the sense of responsibility and
prevent laxness and indifference as well as to gain the services of those
who must earn something
Do not take a man as leader simply because he has certificates of
recommendation Know him personally Find out what he is capable of doing
The following blank I use in securing information

Illustration A Leaders PulpitSunday Morning in  the
ChapelbytheLakeCamp Becket
Leaders should not be chosen in order to secure a baseball team or an
athletic team Select men of diverse gifts One should know something
about nature study another about manual training another a good
storyteller another a good athlete or baseball player another a good
swimmer another a musician etc Always remember however that the chief
qualification should be moral worth
Before camp opens it is a wise plan to send each leader a letter
explaining in detail the purpose and program of the camp A letter like
the following is sent to the leaders of Camps Durrell and Becket
SUGGESTIONS TO CAMP LEADERS
READ AND REREAD
The success of a boys camp depends upon the hearty cooperation of each
leader with the superintendent The boys will imitate you A smile is
always better than a frown Kicking in the presence of boys breeds
discontent Loyalty to the camp and its management is absolutely necessary
if there is to be harmony in the camp life
Personal
Your personal life will either be a blessing or a hindrance to the boys in
your tent Study each boy in your tent Win his confidence Determine to
do your best in being a genuine friend of each boy Remember in prayer
daily each boy and your fellow leaders Emphasize the camp motto Each
for all and all for each Study the tests on pages 8 and 9 of the
booklets and be helpful to the boys in your tent who are ambitious to
improve and win the honor emblems
Tents
Neatness and cleanliness must be the watchword of each tent Sweets draw
ants Decayed material breeds disease Insist upon the observance of
sanitary rules
It is unwise to have all the boys from one town or city in one tent The
tendency is to form clans which destroy camp spirit Get the fellows
together the first thing and choose a tent name and tent yells
Appoint a boy who will be responsible for the boys and the tent when you
are not present
Too much attention cannot be given to the matter of ventilation When it
rains use a forked stick to hold the flaps open in the form of a diamond
In clear weather tie one flap back at each end flap toward the feet
allowing a free draft of air at all times On rainy days encourage the
boys to spend their time in the pavillion Whenever possible insist upon
tent and blankets being thoroughly aired each morning
Three inspectors will be appointed for each day fifteen minutes notice
will be given and boys will not be allowed in or around their tents during
the period of inspection Leaders may suggest but not participate in
arranging the tent
The Honor Banner is to be given to the tent showing the best condition and
held as long as marks are highest
Swimming
The U S V L S C1 crews in boats will patrol whenever the boys are
in swimming and the leader of swimming must give the signal before boys
go into the water Boys who cannot swim should be encouraged to learn The
morning dip must be a dip and not a swim
Transcribers Note 1 United States Volunteer Life Saving Corps
Boats
No boats are to be taken unless an order has been issued by the tent
leader or by the superintendent The man at the wharf always has power
to veto orders at his discretion
Order of Day
It is the leaders part to see that the order of the day is carried out
and on time including the setting up drill See Camp Booklet Follow
the leader is an old game which is still influencing boys
Work
Three tents and their leaders are responsible for the work at camp and
will be expected to report to the assistant superintendent after breakfast
for assignment of work These tents are changed each day so that the boys
and leaders come on duty only one day in seven
Each tent is under its respective leader in doing the following work
Tent 1 Sanitary work such as policing the campus emptying garbage cans
sweeping the pavillion disinfecting etc
Tent 2 Preparing vegetables for the cook drying dishes pots pans
cleaning up the kitchen piazza etc
Tent 3 Cleaning the boats supplying wood for the kitchen putting ice in
the refrigerator etc
The next day tents 4 5 and 6 will come on duty and so on until each tent
has been on duty during the week
Leaders for the day will call the squad together after breakfast and
explain the days plans Encourage the boys to do this work cheerfully
Lead do not drive the boys when working Not more than three hours should
be consumed in camp work
Sports and Pastimes
Bring rule books on athletics Study up group games Bring any old clothes
for costumes tambourines and bones for minstrel show grease paint and
burnt corkin fact anything that you think will add to the fun of the
camp Good stories and jokes are always in demand Bring something
interesting to read to your boys on rainy days Think out some stunt to do
at the social gatherings If you play an instrument be sure to bring it
along with you
Bank
Encourage the boys to turn their money and railroad tickets over to the
camp banker instead of depositing them with you
Camp Council
Meetings of the leaders will be held at the call of the superintendent
Matters talked over at the council meeting should not be talked over with
the boys All matters of discipline or anything that deals with the
welfare of the camp should be brought up at this meeting Printed report
blanks will be given to each leader to be filled out and handed to the
assistant superintendent each Thursday morning Do not show these reports
to the boys
Bible Study
Each leader will be expected to read to the boys in his tent a chapter
from the Bible and have prayers before taps each night also to take his
turn in leading the morning devotions at breakfast table Groups of boys
will meet for occasional Bible study at sunset under various leaders Each
session will continue twenty minutesno longer Sunday morning service
will be somewhat formal in character with an address The sunset vesper
service will be informal
Praying that the camp may prove a place where leaders and boys may grow in
the best things of life and anticipating an outing of pleasure and profit
to you I am Your friend signature
Opportunities
In securing men for leadership impress upon them the many opportunities
for the investment of their lives in the kind of work that builds
character In reading over a small folder written by George H Hogeman of
Orange N J I was so impressed with his excellent presentation of this
theme of opportunities of leadership that the following is quoted in
preference to anything I could write upon the subject
The opportunity of the boys camp leader is first to engage in the
service that counts most largely in securing the future welfare of those
who will soon be called upon to carry on the work that we are now engaged
in Most people are so busy with their own present enjoyment and future
success that they pay little heed to the future of others They may give
some thought to the present need of those around them because it more or
less directly affects themselves but the work of character building in
boys camps is one that shows its best results in the years to come rather
than in the immediate present
In the second place the opportunity comes to the camp leader to know
boys as few other people know them sometimes even better than their own
parents know them When you live eat sleep with a boy in the open free
life of camp for a month or so you come in contact with him at vastly
more points than you do in the more restrained home life and you see
sides of his nature that are seldom seen at other times
Finally the opportunity is given to the man who spends his vacation in
camp to make the time really count for something in his own life and in
the lives of others To how many does vacation really mean a relaxation a
letting down of effort along one line without the substitution of
anything definite in its place But he must be a dull soul indeed who
can come to the right kind of boys camp and not go away with his muscles
harder his eye brighter his digestion better and his spirit more awake
to the things that pertain to the Kingdom of God
Then again the camp leader must have the ability to forget himself in
others Nowhere can the real play spirit be entered into more completely
than in camp life A watchman is the last thing he must be That spirit of
unselfishness which forgets its own personal pleasure in doing the most
for the general good is the ideal camp spirit As Lowell puts it in the
Vision of Sir Launfal it is
Not what we give but what we share
For the gift without the giver is bare
The results of all these points which I have mentioned are some very
positive things One is the very best kind of a vacation that it is
possible to have How frequently we hear in response to the question about
enjoying a vacation Oh yes I had a good enough time but Ill never go
back there again To my mind that indicates either that the person does
not know what a really good time is or that his surroundings made a good
time impossible
Another result of camp is the real friendships that last long after
camping days are over Of these I need not speak You and I know of many
such and what they mean in the development of Christian character in the
lives of our men and boys And after all there is the greatest result of
all the sense of confidence in the ultimate outcome that comes with
having a share in the work of bringing others to the measure of the
stature of the fullness of Christ
The ideal life for a boy is not in the city He should know of animals
rivers plants and that great outofdoor life that lays for him the
foundation of his later years

Dirt
Clean camps are most easily kept by not allowing them to become dirty
Cleanliness is next to Godliness Godliness means a right relation to
things spiritual cleanliness a right relation to things material An old
definition says that Dirt is merely misplaced matter Of all the
vehicles of disease the most important perhaps is dirt The word dirt in
its strict sense comes from the AngloSaxon drit or excrement Dirt
then is not earth or clean sandnot clean dirt but dirty dirt that is
matter soiled by some of the excreta of the human or animal body
Cleanliness must be insisted upon in a boys Campnot the cleanliness
that makes a boy squeamish about working with his hands upon some
necessary job but cleanliness that makes him afraid of sharing his tooth
brush or table utensils or his clothes
Cleanliness is not the shunning of good clean dirt but a recognition of
the fact that to pass anything from one mouth to another is a possible
source of death and destruction 1 Death to dirt should be the
watchword of the camp The camp should be a model of cleanliness Every
boy should be taught the value of good sanitation and encouraged to
cooperate in making proper sanitation effective
Footnote 1 Dr Chas E A WinslowCamp Conference p 58
Avoid Swamps
The location chosen for a camp should be away from swamps Avoid swampy
and low places as you would a plague Damp places where there are
mosquitoes should be well drained and open to an abundance of sunshine
Mosquitoes breed only in water but a very little water is sufficient if
it is dirty and stagnant Two inches of water standing in an old tin can
will breed an innumerable horde These diminutive musicians are not only
a nuisance but dangerous as malaria and typhoid spreaders by their
poisonous stings
The Site
In selecting a camp site bear in mind these things 1 A sandy subsoil
with good drainage Avoid very sandy soil sand provides but little hold
