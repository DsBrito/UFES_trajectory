THE STORY OF DON QUIXOTE
VOLUME I
CHAPTER I
WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS
GENTLEMAN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA
Nearly four hundred years ago there lived in the village of La Mancha
in Spain an old gentleman of few worldly possessions but many books
who was given to a hardy and adventurous way of life and who beguiled
his spare time by reading the many tales of chivalry and knighthood
that were in his possession
This old gentleman was a tall gaunt man of about fifty with a
lantern jaw and straggling gray hair and eyes that had a sparkle of
madness in them His surname was Quixada or Quesada and though not
rich he was well known to the country folk and had some reputation in
the community where he lived
In his younger days he was a great sportsman and used to get up before
the sun to follow his favorite pursuits of hunting and hawking but as
he grew older he spent almost all his time in reading books on
chivalry and knighthood with which his library was stocked and at
last he grew so fond of these books that he forgot to follow the
hounds or even to look after his property but spent all his time in
his library mulling over the famous deeds and love affairs of knights
who conquered dragons and vanquished wicked enchanters
At the time when Quesada lived Spain was saturated with this sort of
literature and everybody wasted much time in reading books which had no
merit or value of any kind and which were full of the most ridiculous and
impossible adventures On the whole they were the most utter rubbish that
it was possible to print They told about impossible deeds in the most
impossible language and were filled with ambitious sentences that meant
nothing under the sun Senor Quesada spent hours racking his brains to
puzzle out the meaning of something like this
The reason of the unreason with which my reason is
afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I murmur
at your beauty
Or again
The high heavens that of your divinity divinely fortify
you with the stars render you deserving of the desert
your greatness deserves
Poor Senor Quesada could not understand these sentences Who could No
man in his right mind certainly it would have taken a madman to read
any real meaning into them And he wasted so much time in puzzling
over them that at last he became quite mad and the words in the books
would appear on the walls of his room written in letters of fire
with so bright a light that they prevented him from sleeping From
trying to read a meaning into things that had no meaning whatever
Senor Quesada was madas mad as the books he had been reading
Senor Quesada lived with his niece and his housekeeper both sensible
women who loved him and who were much grieved over the havoc his
books of chivalry had worked with his senses They believed that to
talk about these books made the old gentleman worse so they refused
to answer him when he argued about knights and dragons and whether
this fair lady was an enchantress in disguise or only a mortal woman
and whether that dragon actually did breathe forth fire from his
nostrils or only sulphur fumes and smoke His niece and the
housekeeper would run away when he started upon one of his favorite
subjects so he turned to the society of the village curate a learned
man for those times who knew almost as much about books of chivalry
as Senor Quesada himself and to that of Master Nicholas the village
barber And these three friends would sit up until dawn arguing as to
who was the better knight Sir Lancelot or Amadis of Gaul and how
these both compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one
back stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants
After he had become thoroughly mad from reading and more so from such
arguments and discussions Senor Quesada hit upon the strangest notion
that ever entered the head of a lunatic He believed that he and no
other was called upon to restore the entire world to the ancient
conditions of chivalry and bring back the tournaments and the
courteous knights and fair ladies whose like had existed in the times
of the famous King Arthur of Britain Believing this it was an easy
step for him to think that the world was still full of giants and
fierce dragons for him to vanquish and that as a man of honor and
skill at arms he must leave his comfortable home and do battle with
them To his disordered senses things took on a different appearance
than was actually the caseinns seemed castles and towers and hills
appeared as giants that moved about in the distance and Senor Quesada
could hardly wait before he could meet them on horseback and overthrow
them in battle
To become a knight and encounter all these strange and visionary dangers
it was necessary for him however to have a war horse a stout lance and
a suit of armor and he cast about among his possessions to see what he
could find that would answer the purposefor he had no money to buy
them and no shop could have furnished them for him if he had possessed
all the money in Spain In his attic he found an old suit of armor that
had belonged to his greatgrandfather and had been lying there for ages
rotting with rust and mildew in company with old chests bedding and
other family treasures He brought it out and scoured it as best he could
and at last made it shine with considerable brightness But the helmet
was only partially complete for it lacked a beaver and a visor to
protect his face so Senor Quesada constructed these from pasteboard and
painted them to resemble the armor as closely as possible He tried their
strength with his rusty sword and on the first stroke cut them entirely
away so he rebuilt them and forbore to try them again hoping they would
be strong enough but fearing to make a test that might undo once more
all the troublesome work that he had spent upon them
His armor now complete he looked in his stables for a horse to carry
him and found there his old hack whose every bone was visible and
who was more used to carrying sacks of potatoes and onions to market
than to bearing the weight of a knight or a man at arms This horse
must have been at least twenty years old into the bargain but to
Quixadas brain it appeared a mettlesome charger and he was quite sure
that his new steed would prove equal to any fatigue or danger that
might come its way in the course of his adventures And remembering
that all the horses of famous warriors had possessed highsounding
names he called his horse Rocinante and adopted for himself the title
of Don Quixote of La Mancha under which name he will be known through
the rest of the present history
Another thing however remained wantinga ladylove for whose sake
he might do battle and whose affections might inspire him to endure
all sorts of dangers and hardships So Don Quixote straightway
searched through his recollection to find one that might answer and
hit at last upon a peasant girl named Aldonza Lorenzo with whom it is
supposed he had been in love when he was a young man And though
Aldonza Lorenzo was more used to winnowing wheat and caring for the
livestock than to fine phrases and courtly manners and though she
was no better than any of the other peasant girls who lived in her
locality Don Quixote believed that she was a lady of high lineage and
noble birth and christened her in his mind Dulcinea del Toboso And he
was ready to fight with any man in Spain who would not acknowledge
that she was the loveliest and most gifted lady in the world
A lance was easily made and now possessed of war horse armor
weapons and a glorious lady to do battle for the poor old man was
ready so he believed to go forth and meet the high adventures that
he felt sure were awaiting him

WHICH TREATS OF THE FIRST SALLY DON QUIXOTE MADE FROM HOME
All things being ready Don Quixote wished for no delay and before
sunrise on one of the hottest days of midsummer he stole from his
bedtaking care not to awaken his niece or his housekeeperput on
his ancient armor saddled Rocinante and with lance in hand and sword
clattering beside him made his way across the fields in the highest
state of content and satisfaction at the ease with which his purpose
had been accomplished He could hardly wait for his adventures to
begin or for the chance to try the strength of his mighty arm upon
some wicked warrior or better still some dragon or giant but
scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain before a terrible
thought came to his mind and one that nearly made him abandon his
adventure before it was well begun He reflected that according to
the rules of chivalry he must be dubbed a knight before he could
undertake any battles or engagements and afterward he must wear white
armor without any device upon his shield until he had proved by
bravery and endurance his right to these privileges of knighthood He
consoled himself however by resolving to have himself dubbed a
knight by the first person who came along and as for white armor he
determined to make his own rival the brightness of the moon by
industrious scouring
Comforting himself with thoughts such as these he pursued his way
which he allowed his horse to choose for him thinking that in so
doing he would be guided more surely and more quickly to the
adventures that were awaiting him And as he rode along he amused
himself by quoting imaginary passages from the books that he felt sure
would be written about his noble deedsdeeds that he would soon
accomplish and that would astonish the entire world by their bravery
and hardihood At times he would break into wild speech calling his
lady Dulcinea by name and saying O Princess Dulcinea lady of this
captive heart a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me forth
with scorn and banish me from the presence of thy beauty
And so he went along stringing such absurd phrases together while
the hot sun rose and grew hotter until it would have melted his
brains in his helmet if he had any He traveled nearly all day
without seeing anything remarkable at which he was in despair for he
could hardly wait as we have said for his adventures to begin
Toward evening he came in sight of a common wayside inn and standing at
the door were two peasant girls who looked with astonishment on the
strange figure that was approaching them To the disordered imagination
of Don Quixote this appeared to be a castle with four towers and the
girls who stood in front of the door seemed ladies of noble birth and
peerless beauty He seemed to see behind them a drawbridge and a moat
and waited for some dwarf to appear upon the castle battlements and by
sound of a trumpet announce that a knight was approaching the gates
At this point a swineherd who was gathering his pigs did happen to
blow a blast on his horn to scare his charges along the road and
this appearing to Don Quixote to be the dwarfs signal that he had
expected he drew near in high satisfaction while Rocinante scenting
stables and hay and water pricked up his ears and advanced at a brisk
trot until the inn door was reached and Don Quixote addressed the
astonished girls who were waiting there
The girls on seeing an armed man approaching them had turned to seek
safety indoors when Don Quixote lifting his pasteboard beaver said
to them in the most courteous manner he could command
Ladies I beseech you do not fly or fear any manner of rudeness for
it is against the rules of the knighthood which I profess to offer
harm to highborn ladies such as you appear to be
The girls hearing themselves addressed in this strange manner and
called ladies could not refrain from giggling at which Don Quixote
rebuked them saying
Modesty becomes the fair and laughter without cause is the greatest
silliness
The strange language and dilapidated appearance of the speaker only
increased the girls laughter and that increased Don Quixotes
irritation and matters might have gone farther if the landlord had
not appeared at this moment to see what might be the matter When he
beheld the grotesque figure on horseback whose armor did not match and
whose mount was the sorriest one imaginable it was all he could do to
refrain from joining the girls in their hilarity but being a little
