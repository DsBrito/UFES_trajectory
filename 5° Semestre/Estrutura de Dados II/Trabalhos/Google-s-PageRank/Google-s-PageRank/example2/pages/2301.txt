and the play runs on their blunders and her unpretending wisdom That
is a very fine plot which I recommend to our female novelists My aim
in these pages has been much humbler and is I hope too clear to need
explanation
CHARLES READE
A SIMPLETON
CHAPTER I
A young lady sat pricking a framed canvas in the drawingroom of Kent
Villa a mile from Gravesend she was making at a cost of time and
tinted wool a chair cover admirably unfit to be sat uponexcept by
some severe artist bent on obliterating discordant colors To do her
justice her mind was not in her work for she rustled softly with
restlessness as she sat and she rose three times in twenty minutes and
went to the window Thence she looked down over a trim flowery
lawn and long sloping meadows on to the silver Thames alive with
steamboats ploughing white sails bellying and great ships carrying to
and fro the treasures of the globe From this fair landscape and epitome
of commerce she retired each time with listless disdain she was waiting
for somebody
Yet she was one of those whom few men care to keep waiting Rosa
Lusignan was a dark but dazzling beauty with coalblack hair and
glorious dark eyes that seemed to beam with soul all day long her
eyebrows black straightish and rather thick would have been majestic
and too severe had the other features followed suit but her black
brows were succeeded by long silky lashes a sweet oval face two
pouting lips studded with ivory and an exquisite chin as feeble as any
man could desire in the partner of his bosom Personstraight elastic
and rather tall Mindnineteen Accomplishmentsnumerous a poor
French scholar a worse German a worse English an admirable dancer
an inaccurate musician a good rider a bad draughtswoman a bad
hairdresser at the mercy of her maid a hot theologian knowing
nothing a sorry accountant no housekeeper no seamstress a fair
embroideress a capital geographer and no cook
Collectively viz mind and body the girl we kneel to
This ornamental member of society now glanced at the clock once more
and then glided to the window for the fourth time She peeped at the
side a good while with superfluous slyness or shyness and presently
she drew back blushing crimson then she peeped again still more
furtively then retired softly to her frame and for the first time
set to work in earnest As she plied her harpoon smiling now the large
and vivid blush that had suffused her face and throat turned from
carnation to rose and melted away slowly but perceptibly and ever so
sweetly and somebody knocked at the street door
The blow seemed to drive her deeper into her work She leaned over it
graceful as a willow and so absorbed she could not even see the door
of the room open and Dr Staines come in
All the better her not perceiving that slight addition to her furniture
gives me a moment to describe him
A young man five feet eleven inches high very square shouldered and
deep chested but so symmetrical and light in his movements that his
size hardly struck one at first He was smooth shaved all but a short
thick auburn whisker his hair was brown His features no more then
comely the brow full the eyes wide apart and deepseated the lips
rather thin but expressive the chin solid and square It was a face
of power and capable of harshness but relieved by an eye of unusual
color between hazel and gray and wonderfully tender In complexion
he could not compare with Rosa his cheek was clear but pale for
few young men had studied night and day so constantly Though but
twentyeight years of age he was literally a learned physician deep in
hospital practice deep in books especially deep in German science
too often neglected or skimmed by English physicians He had delivered a
course of lectures at a learned university with general applause
As my reader has divined Rosa was preparing the comedy of a cool
reception but looking up she saw his pale cheek tinted with a lovers
beautiful joy at the bare sight of her and his soft eye so divine with
love that she had not the heart to chill him She gave him her hand
kindly and smiled brightly on him instead of remonstrating She lost
nothing by it for the very first thing he did was to excuse himself
eagerly I am behind time the fact is just as I was mounting my
horse a poor man came to the gate to consult me He had a terrible
disorder I have sometimes succeeded in arrestingI attack the cause
instead of the symptoms which is the old practiceand so that detained
me You forgive me
Of course Poor manonly you said you wanted to see papa and he
always goes out at two
When she had been betrayed into saying this she drew in suddenly and
blushed with a pretty consciousness
Then dont let me lose another minute said the lover Have you
prepared him forforwhat I am going to have the audacity to say
Rosa answered with some hesitation I MUST havea little When I
refused Colonel Brightyou need not devour my hand quitehe is forty
Her sentence ended and away went the original topic and grammatical
sequence along with it Christopher Staines recaptured them both Yes
dear when you refused Colonel Bright
Well papa was astonished for everybody says the colonel is a most
eligible match Dont you hate that expression I do Eligible
Christopher made due haste and recaptured her Yes love your papa
said
I dont think I will tell you He asked me was there anybody else and
of course I said No
Oh
Oh that is nothing I had not time to make up my mind to tell the
truth I was taken by surprise and you know ones first impulse is to
fibabout THAT
But did you really deceive him
No I blushed and he caught me so he said Come now there was
And you said Yes there is like a brave girl as you are
What plump like that No I was frightened out of my wits like a
brave girl as I am not and said I should never marry any one he could
disapprove and thenoh then I believe I began to cry Christopher
Ill tell you something I find people leave off teasing you when you
crygentlemen I mean Ladies go on all the more So then dear papa
kissed me and told me I must not be imprudent and throw myself away
that was all and I promised him I never would I said he would be sure
to approve my choice and he said he hoped so And so he will
Dr Staines looked thoughtful and said he hoped so too But now
it comes to the point of asking him for such a treasure I feel my
deficiencies
Why what deficiencies You are young and handsome and good and ever
so much cleverer than other people You have only to ask for me and
insist on having me Come dear go and get it over She added mighty
coolly There is nothing so DREADFUL as suspense
Ill go this minute said he and took a step towards the door but he
turned and in a moment was at her knees He took both her hands in his
and pressed them to his beating bosom while his beautiful eyes poured
love into hers pointblank May I tell him you love me Oh I know you
cannot love me as I love you but I may say you love me a little may I
notthat will go farther with him than anything else May I Rosa may
Ia little
His passion mastered her She dropped her head sweetly on his shoulder
and murmured You know you may my own Who would not love you
He parted lingeringly from her then marched away bold with love and
hope to demand her hand in marriage
Rosa leaned back in her chair and quivered a little with new emotions
Christopher was right she was not capable of loving like him but
still the actual contact of so strong a passion made her womans nature
vibrate A dewy tear hung on the fringes of her long lashes and she
leaned back in her chair and fluttered awhile
That emotion almost new to her soon yielded in her girlish mind to a
complacent languor and that in its turn to a soft reverie So she was
going to be married To be mistress of a house settle in London THAT
she had quite determined long ago be able to go out into the streets
all alone to shop or visit have a gentleman all her own whom she
could put her finger on any moment and make him take her about even to
the opera and the theatre to give dinnerparties her own self and even
a little ball once in a way to buy whatever dresses she thought proper
instead of being crippled by an allowance have the legal right of
speaking first in society even to gentlemen rich in ideas but bad
starters instead of sitting mumchance and mockmodest to be Mistress
instead of Misscontemptible title to be a woman instead of a girl
and all this rational liberty domestic power and social dignity were
to be obtained by merely wedding a dear fellow who loved her and was
so nice and the bright career to be ushered in with several delights
each of them dear to a girls very soul presents from all her friends
as many beautiful new dresses as if she was changing her body or her
hemisphere instead of her name eclat going to church which is a
good English girls theatre of display and temple of vanity and there
tasting delightful publicity and whispered admiration in a heavenly
long veil which she could not wear even once if she remained single
This bright variegated picture of holy wedlock and its essential
features as revealed to young ladies by feminine tradition though not
enumerated in the Book of Common Prayer writ by grim males so entranced
her that time flew by unheeded and Christopher Staines came back from
her father His step was heavy he looked pale and deeply distressed
then stood like a statue and did not come close to her but cast a
piteous look and gasped out one word that seemed almost to choke
himREFUSED
Miss Lusignan rose from her chair and looked almost wildly at him with
her great eyes Refused said she faintly
Yes said he sadly Your father is a man of business and he took
a mere business view of our love he asked me directly what provision
I could make for his daughter and her children Well I told him I had
three thousand pounds in the Funds and a good profession and then I
said I had youth health and love boundless love the love that can
do or suffer the love that can conquer the world
Dear Christopher And what COULD he say to all that
He ignored it entirely There Ill give you his very words He said
In that case Dr Staines the simple question is what does your
profession bring you in per annum
Oh There I always hated arithmetic and now I abominate it
Then I was obliged to confess I had scarcely received a hundred pounds
in fees this year but I told him the reason this is such a small
district and all the ground occupied London I said was my sphere
And so it is said Rosa eagerly for this jumped with her own little
designs Genius is wasted in the country Besides whenever anybody
worth curing is ill down here they always send to London for a doctor
I told him so dearest said the lover But he answered me directly
then I must set up in London and as soon as my books showed an income
to keep a wife and servants and children and insure my life for five
thousand pounds
Oh that is so like papa He is director of an insurance company so
all the world must insure their lives
No dear he was quite right there professional incomes are most
precarious Death spares neither young nor old neither warm hearts
nor cold I should be no true physician if I could not see my own
mortality He hung his head and pondered a moment then went on sadly
It all comes to thisuntil I have a professional income of eight
hundred a year at least he will not hear of our marrying and the cruel
thing is he will not even consent to an engagement But said the
rejected with a look of sad anxiety you will wait for me without
that dear Rosa
She could give him that comfort and she gave it him with loving
earnestness Of course I will and it shall not be very long Whilst
you are making your fortune to please papa I will keep fretting and
pouting and crying till he sends for you
Bless you dearest Stopnot to make yourself ill not for all the
world The lover and the physician spoke in turn
He came all gratitude to her side and they sat hand in hand
comforting each other indeed parting was such sweet sorrow that they
sat handed and very close to one another till Mr Lusignan who
thought five minutes quite enough for rational beings to take leave in
walked into the room and surprised them At sight of his gray head and
irongray eyebrows Christopher Staines started up and looked confused
he thought some apology necessary so he faltered out Forgive me sir
it is a bitter parting to me you may be sure
Rosas bosom heaved at these simple words She flew to her father
and cried Oh papa papa you were never cruel before and hid her
burning face on his shoulder and then burst out crying partly for
Christopher partly because she was now ashamed of herself for having
taken a young mans part so openly
Mr Lusignan looked sadly discomposed at this outburst she had taken
him by his weak point he told her so Now Rosa said he rather
peevishly you know I hatenoise
Rosa had actually forgotten that trait for a single moment but being
reminded of it she reduced her sobs in the prettiest way not to offend
a tender parent who could not bear noise Under this homely term you
must know he included all scenes disturbances rumpuses passions and
expected all men women and things in Kent Villa to go smoothlyor go
elsewhere
Come young people said he dont make a disturbance Wheres the
grievance Have I said he shall never marry you Have I forbidden him
to correspond or even to call say twice a year All I say is no
marriage nor contract of marriage until there is an income Then he
turned to Christopher Now if you cant make an income without her how
could you make one with her weighed down by the load of expenses a wife
entails I know her better than you do she is a good girl but rather
luxurious and selfindulgent She is not cut out for a poor mans wife
And pray dont go and fancy that nobody loves my child but you Mine is
not so hot as yours of course but believe me sir it is less selfish
You would expose her to poverty and misery but I say no it is my duty
to protect her from all chance of them and in doing it I am as much
your friend as hers if you could but see it Come Dr Staines be
a man and see the world as it is I have told you how to earn my
daughters hand and my esteem you must gain both or neither
Dr Staines was never quite deaf to reason he now put his hand to his
brow and said with a sort of wonder and pitiful dismay My love
for Rosa selfish Sir your words are bitter and hard Then after a
struggle and with rare and touching candor Ay but so are bark and
steel yet they are good medicines Then with a great glow in his heart
and tears in his eyes My darling shall not be a poor mans wife
she who would adorn a coronet ay or a crown Goodby Rosa for the
present He darted to her and kissed her hand with all his soul Oh
the sacrifice of leaving you he faltered the very world is dark
to me without you Ah well I must earn the right to come again He
summoned all his manhood and marched to the door There he seemed to
turn calmer all of a sudden and said firmly yet humbly Ill try and
show you sir what love can do
And Ill show you what love can suffer said Rosa folding her
beautiful arms superbly
It was not in her to have shot such a bolt except in imitation yet how
promptly the mimic thunder came and how grand the beauty looked with
her dark brows and flashing eyes and folded arms much grander and
more inspired than poor Staines who had only furnished the idea
But between these two figures swelling with emotion the representative
of common sense Lusignan pere stood cool and impassive he shrugged
his shoulders and looked on both lovers as a couple of ranting novices
he was saving from each other and almshouses
For all that when the lover had torn himself away papas composure was
suddenly disturbed by a misgiving He stepped hastily to the stairhead
and gave it vent Dr Staines said he in a loud whisper Staines was
half way down the stairs he stopped I trust to you as a gentleman
not to mention this it will never transpire here Whatever we dono
noise
CHAPTER II
Rosa Lusignan set herself pining as she had promised and she did it
discreetly for so young a person She was never peevish but always sad
and listless By this means she did not anger her parent but only made
him feel she was unhappy and the house she had hitherto brightened
exceeding dismal
By degrees this noiseless melancholy undermined the old gentleman and
he wellnigh tottered
But one day calling suddenly on a neighbor with six daughters he heard
peals of laughter and found Rosa taking her full share of the senseless
mirth She pulled up short at sight of him and colored high but it
was too late for he launched a knowing look at her on the spot and
muttered something about seven foolish virgins
He took the first opportunity when they were alone and told her he was
glad to find she was only dismal at home
But Rosa had prepared for him One can be loud without being gay at
heart said she with a lofty languid air I have not forgotten your
last words to HIM We were to hide our broken hearts from the world I
try to obey you dear papa but if I had my way I would never go
into the world at all I have but one desire nowto end my days in a
convent
Please begin them first A convent Why youd turn it out of window
You are no more fit to be a nun thana pauper
Not having foreseen this facer Rosa had nothing ready so she received
it with a sad submissive helpless sigh as who would say Hit me
papa I have no friend now So then he was sorry he had been so clever
and indeed there is one provoking thing about a womans weaknessit
is invincible
The next minute what should come but a long letter from Dr Staines
detailing his endeavors to purchase a practice in London and his
illsuccess The letter spoke the language of love and hope but the
facts were discouraging and indeed a touching sadness pierced through
the veil of the brave words
Rosa read it again and again and cried over it before her father to
encourage him in his heartless behavior
About ten days after this something occurred that altered her mood
She became grave and thoughtful but no longer lugubrious She seemed
desirous to atone to her father for having disturbed his cheerfulness
She smiled affectionately on him and often sat on a stool at his knee
and glided her hand into his
He was not a little pleased and said to himself She is coming round
to commonsense
Now on the contrary she was farther from it than ever
At last he got the clew One afternoon he met Mr Wyman coming out of
the villa Mr Wyman was the consulting surgeon of that part
What anybody ill said Mr Lusignan One of the servants
No it is Miss Lusignan
Why what is the matter with her
Wyman hesitated Oh nothing very alarming Would you mind asking her
Why
The fact is she requested me not to tell you made me promise
And I insist upon your telling me
And I think you are quite right sir as her father Well she is
troubled with a little spitting of blood
Mr Lusignan turned pale My child spitting of blood God forbid
Oh do not alarm yourself It is nothing serious
Dont tell me said the father It is always serious And she kept
this from me
Masking his agitation for the time he inquired how often it had
occurred this grave symptom
Three or four times this last month But I may as well tell you at
once I have examined her carefully and I do not think it is from the
lungs
From the throat then
No from the liver Everything points to that organ as the seat
of derangement not that there is any lesion only a tendency to
congestion I am treating her accordingly and have no doubt of the
result
Who is the ablest physician hereabouts asked Lusignan abruptly
Dr Snell I think
Give me his address
Ill write to him if you like and appoint a consultation He added
with vast but rather sudden alacrity It will be a great satisfaction
to my own mind
Then send to him if you please and let him be here tomorrow morning
if not I shall take her to London for advice at once
On this understanding they parted and Lusignan went at once to his
daughter O my child said he deeply distressed how could you hide
this from me
Hide what papa said the girl looking the picture of
unconsciousness
That you have been spitting blood
Who told you that said she sharply
Wyman He is attending you
Rosa colored with anger Chatterbox He promised me faithfully not to
But why in Heavens name What would you trust this terrible thing to
a stranger and hide it from your poor father
Yes replied Rosa quietly
The old man would not scold her now he only said sadly I see how it
is because I will not let you marry poverty you think I do not love
you And he sighed
O papa the idea said Rosa Of course I know you love me It was
not that you dear darling foolish papa There if you must know it
was because I did not want you to be distressed I thought I might get
better with a little physic and if not why then I thought Papa is
an old man la I dare say I shall last his time and so why should I
poison your latter days with worrying about ME
Mr Lusignan stared at her and his lip quivered but he thought the
trait hardly consistent with her superficial character He could not
help saying half sadly half bitterly Well but of course you have
told Dr Staines
Rosa opened her beautiful eyes like two suns Of course I have done
nothing of the sort He has enough to trouble him without that Poor
fellow there he is worrying and striving to make his fortune and gain
your esteemthey go together you know you told him so Young cats
will scratch when least expected And for me to go and tell him I am
in danger Why he would go wild He would think of nothing but me and
my health He would never make his fortune and so then even when I
am gone he will never get a wife because he has only got genius and
goodness and three thousand pounds No papa I have not told poor
Christopher I may tease those I love I have been teasing YOU this ever
so long but frighten them and make them miserable No
And here thinking of the anguish that was perhaps in store for those
she loved she wanted to cry it almost choked her not to But she
fought it bravely down she reserved her tears for lighter occasions and
less noble sentiments
Her father held out his arms to her She ran her footstool to him and
sat nestling to his heart
Please forgive me my misconduct I have not been a dutiful daughter
ever since youbut now I will Kiss me my own papa There Now we are
as we always were
Then she purred to him on every possible topic but the one that now
filled his parental heart and bade him goodnight at last with a
cheerful smile
Wyman was exact and ten minutes afterwards Dr Snell drove up in a
carriage and pair He was intercepted in the hall by Wyman and after a
few minutes conversation presented to Mr Lusignan
The father gave vent to his paternal anxiety in a few simple but
touching words and was proceeding to state the symptoms as he had
gathered them from his daughter but Dr Snell interrupted him politely
and said he had heard the principal symptoms from Mr Wyman Then
turning to the latter he said We had better proceed to examine the
patient
Certainly said Mr Lusignan She is in the drawingroom and he led
the way and was about to enter the room when Wyman informed him it was
against etiquette for him to be present at the examination
Oh very well said he Yes I see the propriety of that But oblige
me by asking her if she has anything on her mind
Dr Snell bowed a lofty assent for to receive a hint from a layman was
to confer a favor on him
The men of science were closeted full half an hour with the patient She
was too beautiful to be slurred over even by a busy doctor he felt her
pulse looked at her tongue and listened attentively to her lungs to
her heart and to the organ suspected by Wyman He left her at last with
a kindly assurance that the case was perfectly curable
At the door they were met by the anxious father who came with throbbing
heart and asked the doctors verdict
He was coolly informed that could not be given until the consultation
had taken place the result of that consultation would be conveyed to
him
And pray why cant I be present at the consultation The grounds on
which two able men agree or disagree must be well worth listening to
No doubt said Dr Snell but with a superior smile my dear sir
it is not the etiquette
Oh very well said Lusignan But he muttered So then a father is
nobody
And this unreasonable person retired to his study miserable and gave
up the diningroom to the consultation
They soon rejoined him
Dr Snells opinion was communicated by Wyman I am happy to tell you
that Dr Snell agrees with me entirely the lungs are not affected and
the liver is congested but not diseased
Is that so Dr Snell asked Lusignan anxiously
It is so sir He added The treatment has been submitted to me and
I quite approve it
He then asked for a pen and paper and wrote a prescription He assured
Mr Lusignan that the case had no extraordinary feature whatever he
was not to alarm himself Dr Snell then drove away leaving the parent
rather puzzled but on the whole much comforted
And here I must reveal an extraordinary circumstance
Wymans treatment was by drugs
Dr Snells was by drugs
Dr Snell as you have seen entirely approved Wymans treatment
His own had nothing in common with it The Arctic and Antarctic poles
are not farther apart than was his prescription from the prescription he
thoroughly approved
Amiable science In which complete diversity of practice did not
interfere with perfect uniformity of opinion
All this was kept from Dr Staines and he was entirely occupied in
trying to get a position that might lead to fortune and satisfy Mr
Lusignan He called on every friend he had to inquire where there was
an opening He walked miles and miles in the best quarters of London
looking for an opening he let it be known in many quarters that he
would give a good premium to any physician who was about to retire and
would introduce him to his patients
No he could hear of nothing
Then after a great struggle with himself he called upon his uncle
Philip Staines a retired MD to see if he would do anything for him
He left this to the last for a very good reason Dr Philip was an
irritable old bachelor who had assisted most of his married relatives
but finding no bottom to the well had turned rusty and crusty and now
was apt to administer kicks instead of checks to all who were near and
dear to him However Christopher was the old gentlemans favorite and
was now desperate so he mustered courage and went He was graciously
receivedwarmly indeed This gave him great hopes and he told his
tale
The old bachelor sided with Mr Lusignan What said he do you
want to marry and propagate pauperism I thought you had more sense
Confound it all I had just one nephew whose knock at my streetdoor did
not make me tremble he was a bachelor and a thinker and came for a
friendly chat the rest are married men highwaymen who come to say
Stand and deliver and now even you want to join the giddy throng
Well dont ask me to have any hand in it You are a man of promise and
you might as well hang a millstone round your neck as a wife Marriage
is a greater mistake than ever now the women dress more and manage
worse I met your cousin Jack the other day and his wife with seventy
pounds on her back and next door to paupers No whilst you are a
bachelor like me you are my favorite and down in my will for a lump
Once marry and you join the noble army of footpads leeches vultures
paupers gone coons and babblers about bratsand I disown you
There was no hope from old Crusty Christopher left him snubbed and
heartsick At last he met a sensible man who made him see there was
no short cut in that profession He must be content to play the uphill
game must settle in some good neighborhood marry if possible since
husbands and fathers of families prefer married physicians and so be
poor at thirty comfortable at forty and rich at fiftyperhaps
Then Christopher came down to his lodgings at Gravesend and was very
unhappy and after some days of misery he wrote a letter to Rosa in a
moment of impatience despondency and passion
Rosa Lusignan got worse and worse The slight but frequent hemorrhage
was a drain upon her system and weakened her visibly She began to lose
her rich complexion and sometimes looked almost sallow and a slight
circle showed itself under her eyes These symptoms were unfavorable
nevertheless Dr Snell and Mr Wyman accepted them cheerfully as fresh
indications that nothing was affected but the liver they multiplied and
varied their prescriptions the malady ignored those prescriptions and
went steadily on Mr Lusignan was terrified but helpless Rosa resigned
and reticent
But it was not in human nature that a girl of this age could always and
at all hours be mistress of herself One evening in particular she stood
before the glass in the drawingroom and looked at herself a long
time with horror Is that Rosa Lusignan said she aloud it is her
ghost
A deep groan startled her She turned it was her father She thought he
was fast asleep and so indeed he had been but he was just awaking and
heard his daughter utter her real mind It was a thunderclap Oh my
child what shall I do he cried
