Muir paid her visits to fairylands forlorn beyond the oak door Barrie
lurked under cover of the convenient thick and wellplaced shadow
behind the grandfather clock on the landing
It was not autumn now which was part of the mystery after these
endless years of routine they seemed endless to Barrie at eighteen
and she would certainly have missed the event had this not been her
keyhole hour
Somehow she had become awarethrough heredity and race memory no
doubtthat looking through keyholes was caddish a trick unworthy of
any lady who was at heart a gentleman But there are exceptions to all
keyholes and this was one because as none save ghosts and fairies
lived or moved behind it in the garret there was nobody to spy upon
You looked through to stimulate the romance in your starved soul and
save it from death by inanition because if romance died then indeed
the Outer Life at Hillard House would be no longer bearable
Barrie paid her respects to the keyhole o mornings for two reasons
The first and commonplace reason was because Mrs Muir was busy
downstairs and had no eye to spare to see whether other eyes were glued
to the wrong places The second and more charming reason was because in
the morning the golden haze floated behind the keyhole like shimmering
water with the sun shining deep into it By afternoon there was nothing
left to peer into but cold gray shadow which meant that the fairies and
other inhabitants were not at home
Mrs Muirs motive for visiting the garret out of season was a simple
one but it was well that Barrie did not know this for it was not at
all interesting and would have broken the music thrown cold water on
the thrill Moths no respecters of persons or judges of high religious
reputations had dared to nest in Mrs MacDonalds best black cashmere
dress which had not been worn and would not be worn except on great
occasions until next season and had mechanically reduced it to the
rate of second best Mothpowder and mothballs were exhausted in
downstairs regions but there was a store of both in the garret and in
her annoyance at having to ascend at an unprecedented time and her
vexation at an accident such as must happen in the best regulated
families Mrs Muir had hurriedly returned with the wanted box
forgetting to lock the door
Barrie could not be sure that the housekeeper was not even now in the
garret but she had to find out and the awful thrill of uncertainty
made her next step a high adventure the adventure of her life It was a
step onto the garret stairs and though it meant dangers of all sorts
she risked them every one and closed the door behind her You see if
she had not done this any person passing along the landinga person
such as Grandma or Janet Hepburnwould at once have seen the streak of
gold a mere yellow crack to them and then and there would have arisen
a clamour for the key
Even with the door closed the risk remained in a lesser degree Mrs
Muir if she were not at this moment in the garret might suddenly
remember that she had left the door ajar taking away the key then she
would rush back like a stout round whirlwind and in a minute more
Barrie would be a prisoner almost like the fair bride in The Mistletoe
Bough only there was more air in the garret than in the oak chest that
shut with a spring But Barrie was used to taking risksrisks
insignificant compared with this yet big enough to supply salt and
sugar for the dry daily bread of existence
The door shut softly butmercy what creaks those steps had in them
They seemed to be vying with each other the heartless brutes as to
which could shriek the loudest under a girls light foot Probably they
had never seen a girl before or if they had it was so long ago they
had forgotten Fancy Grandma a girl No wonder if the steps remembered
her that they yelledBut by this time Barries head had arrived at
the top of the steep stairs and her eyes were peering cautiously
through clouds of gold dust along the level of a floor mountainous in
its far horizon with piled chests trunks and furniture
The gold poured through three very high small dormerwindows which
until now Barrie had known only from outside staring up at the ivied
house wall from the east garden The dust lived in the garret air and
was different from more wonderful and mysterious than any other dust
except perhaps the dust far off in the distance at sunset where
motorcars you could not see passed along a road invisible
Barrie couldnt be quite certain at first whether the garret was empty
of human life or whether Mrs Muir was likely to pounce upon her with
reproaches from behind one of those immense oak posts which went up like
trees to meet the high beamed roof Or she might be concealed by an
oasis of furniture There were several such oases in the large
wilderness of garret which covered the whole upper story of the old
house But a lovely garret it was a heavenly garret even better than
Barrie had dreamed it might be with her eye at the keyhole of the
stairway door It was peopled with possibilitiesglorious echoing
beckoning possibilitieswhich made her heart beat as she could not
remember its beating before
She climbed the remaining steps regardless of squeaks because she could
not any longer bear the suspense concerning Mrs Muir Nothing moved in
answer to the old woods complainings and there was no other sound or
rather there were no real sounds such as are made by people but when
Barrie reached the head of the stairs the whole garret was full to her
ears of delicate rustlings and whisperings sighs and footfalls and
breathings and scurryings out of sight
No Mrs Muir was not here or by this time she would be out in the open
and scolding hard
Barrie drew in deep breaths of the strange still atmosphere which was
like air that had been put to sleep years and years ago It must have
smelt exactly like this she thought quietly in the lost palace of La
Belle Dormante when the Prince found his way in through barricading
thickets Barrie would hardly have been surprised if she had stumbled
upon a Sleeping Beauty If she had she would have said to herself So
thats the secret Mrs Muirs been hiding by keeping the door locked
up I told you so
The scent of the garret fascinated Barrie and made her heart beat
heavily as if she were on the threshold of a mystery It was made up of
many odours a faint not unpleasant mustiness the smell of dust a
perfume of old potpourri and spices cloves and camphor for moths a
vague fragrance of rosewood and wormeaten oak a hint of beeswax a
tang of unaired leather and old books
Barrie suddenly felt perfectly happy For today this wonderful place
with all its secrets was hers She hardly knew what to explore first
All the really interesting things in the house seemed to have risen to
the top like cream on milk Along a part of one wall opposite the
stairs and under the east windows whence came the morning gold were
ranged rough old bookcases a kind of almshouse for indigent books or
a prison for condemned volumes But what books Barrie was drawn to them
as by many magnets and almost tremulously taking down one after
another she understood the reason of their banishment Here were all
the darling books which used to live down in the library and had been
exiled because she dipped into them they being according to Grandma
and Miss Hepburn most unsuitable for niceminded girls Barrie had
mourned her friends as dead but they had been only sleeping And there
were others apparently far more unsuitable for niceminded girlsold
leatherbound books with quaint wood engravings and thick yellow pages
printed with oldfashioned ss like fs Barrie could have browsed
among this company for hours but there were so many things to see in
the garret so little time for seeing them that she felt compelled
merely to say How do you do and goodbye to each allurement
Her eyes roaming like a pair of crusading knights in search of romance
lighted suddenly on a pile or group of furniture in a distant corner
There was other furniture in the garret certainly more interesting to a
connoisseur and hunter of antiquities but Barrie was neither She had
contrived to seize upon a good deal of queer miscellaneous knowledge
outside lesson hours yet she did not know the difference between
Sheraton and Hepplewhite Chairs and sideboards and settees of Georgian
days and earlier had been relegated to this vast pound of unwanted
things while their places were dishonourably filled downstairs by
midVictorian monstrosities which Mrs MacDonald instinctively approved
no doubt because they could offer no temptation to the eye Barrie might
have felt the beauty of the graceful lines if she had given her
attention to these scattered relics of a past before there was a
Grandma but a group of very different furniture beckoned her curiosity
The fact that there was a group and that it seemed in the dimness to be
alike in colour and design suggested mystery of some sort and
besides it was almost impossible to imagine such furniture adorning
this house
Evidently it had been taken bodily out of one room Why As she asked
herself this question Barrie threaded her way delicately along narrow
paths between chairs extraordinary leather or hairy cowhide trunks and
thrilling bandboxes of enormous size made quaintly beautiful with
Chinese wallpaper She wanted to examine the grouped furniture whose
pale coverings and gilded wood glimmered attractively even in the
darkest corner of the garret
It certainly was the darkest and farthest Was this a coincidence or
had there been a special reason for huddling these things out of sight
There was not even a clear path to them though there seemed to have
been method in planning most of the lanes that led from one luggage or
furniture village to another Nothing led to this village built against
a wall Its site was in a nothoroughfare and perhaps by design
perhaps by accident a barricade had been erected before it not a very
high barricade but a wall or series of stumblingblocks made up of
useless litter If there could be a special corner of disgrace in this
land where all things were under decree of banishment here was the
corner
By means of crawling over under and between numerous strangely
assorted objects which formed the barricade the intruder arrived
somewhat the worse for wear at her destination The furniture village
was composed she discovered of a set of blue satincovered chairs and
sofas with elaborately carved and gilded frames There were tables to
match and an empty glass cabinet two long mirrors with marble brackets
underneath also a highly ornamental chest of drawers and a bedstead of
gilded cane and wood with cupids holding garlands of carved roses
Barrie began talking to herself half aloud according to
longestablished habit Good gracious me she exclaimed so inelegantly
that it was well Miss Hepburn could not hear What things to find in
this house Theyre likelike canary birds in an ironmongers shop Who
could have owned them
Suddenly the answer flashed into her head and sent the blood to her
face as if she had received a stinging slap such as Grandma used to
give These things were my mothers
How insulting that these traces of the vanished one should have been
hustled into a dingy hole where no selfrighteous eyes could be offended
by the sight of them How frivolous and daintily young they looked even
in their dusty and Barrie was furiously sure undeserved disgrace This
was the secret of the locked garret
The girl occasionally had moments of hatred for Grandma moments when
she thought it would have delighted her to see the grim old Puritan
scoffed at and humiliated or even tortured At the picture of torture
however Barries heart invariably failed and in fancy she rescued the
victim But never had she hated Mrs MacDonald so actively as now
My mother she said again How dared the wicked old creature be such
a brute to her
For Barrie was certain that these were relics of her mothers presence
in the house She knew the history of every other woman who had ever
lived here since the place was built in the seventeenth century by an
Alexander Hillard an ancestor of Grandmas A forbidding old prig he
must have been judging from the portrait over the diningroom
mantelpiece a worthy forbear of Ann Hillard who had married Barries
grandfather John MacDonald of Dhrum Barrie often said to herself that
she did not feel related to Grandma She wanted to be all MacDonald
andwhatever her mother had been But it was just that which she did
not know and not a soul would tell This was her grievance the great
and everburning grievance as well as mystery of her otherwise
commonplace existence a conspiracy of silence which kept the secret
under lock and key
Because of Mrs MacDonalds taboo Barries mother had become her
ideal The girl felt that whatever Grandma disapproved must be beautiful
and lovable and there had been enough said as well as enough left
unsaid whenever dumbness could mean condemnation to prove that the old
woman had detested her daughterinlaw
All Barrie knew about the immediate past of her family was that her
fathers people had once been rich and as important as their name
implied They were the MacDonalds of Dhrum an island not far from Skye
but they had lost their money and while old Mrs MacDonald was still a
young married woman it seemed incredible that she could have been
young she and her husband with their one boy had come to her old
home near Carlisle This one boy had grown up to marrySomebody or
according to the standards of Grandma Nobody a creature beyond the
pale The bride must have died soon for even Barries elastic memory
which could recall first steps taken alone and first words spoken
unprompted had no niche in it for a mothers image though fathers
portrait was almost painfully distinct It presented a young man very
tall very thin very sad very dark The frame for this portrait was
the black oak of the library wainscoting picked out with the faded gold
on backs of books in a uniform binding of brown leather Once a day
Barrie had been escorted by her nurse to the door of the library and
left to the tender mercies of this sad young man who raised his eyes
resignedly from reading or writing to emit a How do you do as if she
were a grownup stranger After this question and a suitable reply not
much conversation followed for neither could think of anything to say
After an interval of strained politeness the child was dismissed to
play or lessonsgenerally lessons even from the first for play had
never been considered of importance in Hillard House It was nobler in
the estimation of Grandma and perhaps of father to learn how to spell
the fat cat sat on the black rug rather than to sprawl personally on
the black rug sporting in company with the fat cat
One day Barrie remembered she had been told that father was ill and
she could not bid him good morning She had been treacherously glad for
father was depressing but when days passed and she was still kept from
him it occurred to her that after all father was much much nicer than
Grandma and that his eyes though sad were kind The next and last
time she ever saw him the kind sad eyes were shut and he was lying in
a queer bed like a box He was white as a doll made of porcelain which
he had once given her and Grandma who led the child into his room
said that he was dead The sleeping figure in the box was only the body
and the soul had gone to heaven Heaven according to Grandma who wore
black and had red rims round her eyes was a place high up above the sky
where if you were a sheep you played constantly on a harp and sang
songs If you were a goat you did not get there at all which might
have been preferable except for the fact that being a goat doomed you
to burn in everlasting fire Sheep were saved goats were damned and
of course the sheep must be deserving and clever if they had learned to
sing and play on harps
Barrie thought she could have been no more than three when her father
died but she never cared to question Grandma concerning the episode
after a day when Mrs MacDonald said in an icy voice Your mother was
before God guilty of your fathers death That was years ago now but
Barrie had not forgotten the shock or the hateful thwarted feeling
almost like suffocation when Grandma had answered an outbreak of hers
with the words The less you know about your mother the better for you
And the less like her you grow up the more chance you will have of
escaping punishment in this world and the next
Barrie believed that her mothers hair must have been red for once she
had heard nurse say to Mrs Muir No wonder the sight of the childs a
daily eyesore to the mistress what with them identical dimples and
hair of the selfsame shade it must be a living reminder of what wed
all be glad to forget Barries hair was extremely red and it had been
intimated to her that no redhaired girl could have cause for vanity
because to such unfortunates beauty was denied but loyalty to the
unknown mother forbade the child to hate her coppercoloured locks
In a room decorated with pale blue satin red hair might perhaps
simulate gold The furniture was quite newlooking and unless there had
been some special reason no mere change of taste would have induced
economical Grandma to make a clean sweep of these practically unused
things
A tall mirror with its wooden back turned outward helped to screen the
furniture and deep under the dusty surface of the glass Barrie saw her
own figure dimly reflected like a form moving stealthily in water
beneath thin ice It half frightened her like seeing a spirit and she
brought the gliding ghost to life by polishing the glass This gave her
back suddenly the only friend she had herself and she was glad of the
companionship Close to the huddled furniture stood a large trunk a
Noahs Ark of a trunk Perhaps it was oldfashioned but compared to
other luggage stored here in the garret it was new and defiantly smart
It had a rounded top and was made of gray painted wood clamped with
iron
Too good to be true that it should not be locked And yes locked it
was of course But tied to the iron handle on one end was a key It
seemed as if some one had thought that the trunk might be sent for and
therefore the key must be kept handy The knot was easily undone The
key fitted the lock Her heart beating fast Barrie lifted the lid and
up to her nostrils floated a faint fragrance She had never smelled any
perfume quite like it before The nearest thing was the scent of a
certain rose in the garden when its petals were dried as she dried them
sometimes for a bowl in her own room
It was deep twilight in this corner but Barries eyes were accustoming
themselves to the gloom In the tray of the big trunk there were hats
and masses of something fluffy and soft yet crisp like gauze My
mothers things she said to herself in a very little voice with a
catch of the breath at the word mother And gently she lifted out the
tray to carry it nearer the light There was a cartwheel of a Leghorn
hat in it wreathed with cornflowers another hat of white tulle trimmed
with a single waterlily and a queer little bonnet made of
forgetmenots The fluffy stuff was a large blue scarf spangled with
pinkish sequins
Barrie rested the tray on a marbletopped table and dipped deep into
the trunk for other treasures There were several dresses of delicate
materials and pale shades or else of daring colours elaborately
trimmed There was a gown of coraltinted satin embroidered with gold
and this was of Empire fashion so like the styles which Barrie saw in
illustrated papers that it might have been made yesterday Could a
redhaired woman have chosen to wear such a colour For a moment the
girl doubted that these had been her mothers possessions but when she
held the folds of satin under her own chin she was startled by the
picture in the mirror Why coral was far more becoming than blue which
Miss Hepburn always said was the only colour to go with red hair It
even occurred to Barrie that she might perhaps bewell almost pretty
What if I am pretty after all she asked herself for she
worshipped beauty and it had been sad to feel that to her it was denied
foreverthat never could she be like one of those lovely beings in
books with whom men fall desperately in love and for whom they gladly
die
In great excitement she took off her short badly made blue serge and
put on the coral satin which was low in the neck and had tiny puffed
sleeves The dress fastened at the back but Barrie had grown clever in
doing up her own frocks without help and she easily managed the few
hooks and eyes The satin was creased but in the dim light it looked
fresh and beautiful as the petals of some gorgeous flower and the long
straighthanging gown with magic suddenness turned the childlike girl
into a young woman The two massive tails of hair which fell over
Barries shoulders ending in thick curls at her waist now offended her
sense of fitness They were not grown up enough to suit the wearer of
this fairy robe and crossing the braids at the back of her head she
brought them round it over her ears tying the two curls together in a
sort of bow at the top
Im like Cinderella dressed for the ball she thought all except the
glass slippers and she glanced down distastefully at the thick
serviceable boots whose toes pointed out from under a line of gold
embroidery
There must once have been shoes to match this dress Perhaps they were
at the bottom of the big trunk whose depths she had not yet reached
Bending down for another search she caught sight of something in the
background which she had not seena large picture with its face against
the wall
Instantly Barrie forgot the shoes Her heart jumped as it had jumped
when she first saw the key in the door of the garret stairs Would they
have turned to the wall in this dark corner any picture save one The
girl knew that in another moment she would be looking at the portrait of
her mother
To get at it she had to shut the trunk and climb on the rounded lid
for the big wooden Noahs Ark was too heavy to lift and too firmly
wedged in among large pieces of furniture to be pushed out of the way
Kneeling on the trunk regardless of her finery Barrie grasped the
picture frame with both hands and pulled it up from its narrow
hidingplace Then scrambling down she backed out into a space clear
enough to permit of turning the picture round Then she could not help
giving a little cry for it seemed that she was beholding a miracle Her
own face her own figure the very dress she wore and the odd way she
had looped up her red braids were repeated on the dusty canvas
It seemed too wonderful to be true yet it was true that she had chosen
to put on the gown in which its owner had long ago stood for her
portrait And the knotted curls just above the pictureforehead were
like little ruddy leaping flames
Just at first glance Barrie thought that she was exactly like the
picture but when she had wiped the dust off the canvas and saw the
painting clearly she began to realize and count the differences The
portrait was that of a young woman not a girl still almost a child
Knowledge and love of the world glittered in the great dark eyes which
turned up ever so slightly at their outer corners in a curiously
bewitching way Barries eyes were dark too but they were hazel and
could look gray or even greenish yellow in a bright light but the eyes
in the picture were almost black and full of a triumphing consciousness
of their own fascination The artist had hinted at dimples and these
Barries cheeks repeated but the girls face was in shape a delicate
oval though the chin was as firm as if a loving thumb and finger had
pinched it into prominence The face on the canvas was fuller shorter
squarer and its chin was cleft in the middle The mouth was smaller and
more poutinga selfconscious petulant mouth but Barrie thought it
beautiful with its flowerlike halfsmiling red lips
Mothermother she said darling lovely mother Oh if you could
only talk to me If you could only tell me all about yourself
As she spoke aloud something moved in the garret a board creaked a
struck chair or table scraped along the uneven floor and Mrs Muir
appeared round a corner of the piled furniture Barrie stiffened
herself standing up straight and tall and defiant ready for battle
holding the portrait as if it were a shield But she was not prepared to
see Mrs Muir start back stumbling against something which fell with a
sharp crash nor to hear her give vent to a squeal of terror It was
anger the girl had expected to rouse not fear and she faced the old
housekeeper from her distance in blank astonishment
They stood staring at each other across the shadows lit by floating
motes of gold and Mrs Muirs large pallid face looked Barrie
thought as if it had been turned to gray stone the gray stone of the
carved monuments in the family burialground For a moment neither
spoke but at last some words seemed to drop from the old womans mouth
rather than be deliberately uttered
May God have mercy on me
What is the matter Barrie exclaimed the strange spell broken but
instead of answering Mrs Muir gasped and then broke out crying a
queer gurgly sort of crying which frightened the girl She did not
dislike the housekeeper and she was so genuinely distressed as well as
surprised at this strange exhibition that she would have set down the
portrait to run to Mrs Muirs succour if at that moment the stillness
of the garret had not been wakened by the tap tap of a stick Somebody
was coming up the stairs hobbling limping yet hurrying with
extraordinary energy
There was only one person in the house or maybe in the world whose
coming made that noise that mingled hobble rush and tap Grandma
Barrie and Mrs Muir continued to stare at one another but their
expression had changed The approach of a danger to be shared in common
had made the enemies friends This is going to be awful What shall we
do the old eyes said to the young and the young eyes said to the old
Mrs Muir had forgotten her burning wish and intention to scold Miss
Barribel nevertheless the housekeeper was not to be trusted as an
ally Under the lash of Mrs MacDonalds tongue she would defend
herself and Barrie would go to the wall But the spirit of the martyr
was in the girl and when the first dread thrill of the tap tap on the
garret stairs had subsided in her nerves she remembered her wrongs and
her mothers wrongs and was not afraid of Grandma She girded herself
for war
The tapping came nearer Mrs MacDonald was grievously crippled with
rheumatism Only a strong incentive could have urged her up the steep
straight stairway with its high steps but Grandma was indomitable
Lurching like a ship in a heavy sea she swept round the corner and
brought herself to anchor by planting her stick with a crash on the wavy
oak floor There she stood the grim and hard old craft that had
weathered a hundred storms and refused to be dismayed by any She must
have been alarmed by the housekeepers scream and the crash of falling
furniture and the figure in the coral satin dress was at least as
startling for her as for her old servant but she gave no cry and her
face looked as it always looked hard and stern and passionless as
her gray eyes travelled from granddaughter to housekeeper from
housekeeper to granddaughter
What is the meaning of this she inquired in her worst voice which
Barrie always thought like the turning of a key in an unoiled lock
This maam quavered Mrs Muir unused to the pangs of guilty fear
and bitterly ashamed of them Why Id been up here getting some more
mothballs out of the chemists storebox and while I was gone Miss
Barribel
You must have left the stairway door unlocked woman
For the first time in my life maam I did The answer was an appeal
for justice if not mercy It was an awful thing to be called woman by
the mistress and to be impaled on that sharp gray gaze never sheathed
behind spectacles Mrs Muir was not one to quail easily but she had
been at fault and she realized how her small sin of omission was
leading up to consequences more momentous than anything which had
happened in this house for seventeen years In a flash she remembered
too that it was just seventeen years ago this month of August since the
first wearer of the coral satin had gone forever
That is no excuse said Mrs MacDonald There are some things it is a
sin to forget Locking the garret door is one you well know why Now
the mischief is done
Whod ha dreamed maam that Miss Barribel would ha bin on the watch
like a cat for a mouse
Its no question of dreaming but experience You ought to know as well
as I do that unfortunately the girl is always on the watch for anything
she ought not to see or do It is in her blood These many years I have
struggled to crush down inherited tendencies and keep her on the
straight path I would have her fathers daughter tread Yet how have I
succeeded Every day shows how little This is only one instance among
many
The pale cold eyes having chilled Mrs Muirs blood turned to do their
work of icing Barrie into subjection but the girls veins ran fire For
once Grandma was powerless to make her feel a frozen worm
I wish Id known before that my mothers things were here she said
in a clear loud voice Id have broken down the door to get to them
Theyre mineall mine I will have them
You will not Mrs MacDonald answered Set that portrait back where
you found it with its face to the wall Take off that immodest
outrageous dress and put on your own decent one Fold up the scarlet
abomination and lay it in the trunk with the rest of the brood
Somehow that word brood in connection with her lost mothers gay
pretty garments made Barrie see her grandmother through a red haze
Its the things you say not mothers lovely clothes that are exactly
like a brood of horrid ugly imps she cried Always youve kept
everything about her a secret from me but you cant go on doing it now
Ive seen her beautiful picture I know its hers without any telling
Nothing can make me believe it isnt no matter what you say either of
you So you may as well tell me all about her I wont move till you
do
So be it then said Mrs MacDonald in an iron voice The time had to
come some day Let it be today though for your fathers sake I would
have spared you the knowledge until you reached your twentyfirst year
Do not flatter yourself that your threat not to move has the smallest
effect on me It has none If I chose I could force you to obey me this
instant and put those reminders of sin out of my sight But if you have
any sense of shame in you any affection for your fathers memory it
will be the severest punishment I can inflict to tell you the truth
while you are wearing that dress and looking at the face of that
portrait
Despite her inward flame of fury which did not wane the girl was
struck into silence by her grandmothers tone and manner She stood very
still and white in the coral satin
You can go now Muir said Mrs MacDonald What is to come must be
between me and my sons child
Without a word the housekeeper turned and went away Perhaps she was
glad to escape And now that her own scolding was over there was
sympathy in the last look she threw the girl
There was a certain vague and very dim sense of gratitude in Barries
heart toward Mrs MacDonald for what she had just done For Barrie did
not want other ears to hear evil words spoken of her mother and she was
sure that they would be spoken
Not until the stairs had ceased to creak under the departing feet did
Grandma again open her lips She had seemed to be thinking intently as
if making up her mind how to begin Perhaps she was praying for
guidance Barrie told herself but the morning and evening prayers in
