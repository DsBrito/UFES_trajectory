BEACON LIGHTS OF HISTORY
RICHARD WAGNER MODERN MUSIC
BY HENRY T FINCK
If the Dresden schoolboys who attended the Kreuzschule in the years
18231827 could have been told that one of them was destined to be the
greatest opera composer of all times and to influence the musicians of
all countries throughout the second half of the nineteenth century they
would no doubt have been very much surprised Nor is it likely that
they could have guessed which of them was the chosen one For Richard
Wagneror Richard Geyer as he was then called after his
stepfatherwas by no means a youthful prodigy like Mozart or Liszt It
is related that Beethoven shed tears of displeasure over his first music
lessons nevertheless it was obvious from the beginning that he had a
special gift for music Richard Wagner on the other hand apparently
had none When he was eight years old his stepfather shortly before his
death heard him play on the piano two pieces from one of Webers
operas which made him wonder if Richard might perhaps have talent for
music His piano teacher did not believe even in that perhaps but
told him bluntly he would never amount to anything as a musician
For poetry however young Richard had a decided inclination in his
school years and this was significant inasmuch as it afterwards became
his cardinal maxim that in an opera the plays the thing and the
music merely a means of intensifying the emotional expression Before
his time the music or rather the singing of florid tunes had been the
thing and the libretto merely a peg to hang these tunes on In this
respect therefore the child was father to the man At the age of
eleven he received a prize for the best poem on the death of a
schoolmate At thirteen he translated the first twelve books of Homers
Odyssey He studied English for the sole purpose of being able to read
Shakspeare Then he projected a stupendous tragedy in the course of
which he killed off fortytwo persons many of whom had to be brought
back as ghosts to enable him to finish the play
This extravagance also characterized his first efforts as a composer
when he at last turned to music at the age of sixteen One of his first
tasks when he had barely mastered the rudiments of composition was to
write an overture which he intended to be more complicated than
Beethovens Ninth Symphony Heinrich Dorn who recognized his talent
amid all the bombast conducted this piece at a concert At the
rehearsal the musicians were convulsed with laughter and at the
performance the audience was at first surprised and then disgusted at
the persistence of the drumplayer who made himself heard loudly every
fourth bar Finally there was a general outburst of hilarity which
taught the young man a needed lesson
Undoubtedly the germs of his musical genius had been in Wagners brain
in his childhoodfor genius is not a thing that can be acquired They
had simply lain dormant and it required a special influence to develop
them This influence was supplied by Weber and his operas In 1815 two
years after Wagners birth the King of Saxony founded a German opera in
Dresden where theretofore Italian opera had ruled alone Weber was
chosen as conductor and thus it happened that Wagners earliest and
deepest impressions came from the composer of the Freischutz In his
autobiographic sketch Wagner writes Nothing gave me so much pleasure
as the Freischutz I often saw Weber pass by our house when he came
from rehearsals I always looked upon him with a holy awe It was lucky
for young Richard that his stepfather Geyer besides being a
portraitpainter an actor and a playwright was also one of Webers
tenors at the opera This enabled the boy in spite of the familys
poverty to hear many of the performances In fact Wagner like Weber
owes a considerable part of his success as a writer for the stage to the
fact that he belonged to a theatrical family and thus gradually learned
how the wheels go round Such practical experience is worth more than
years of academic study
While Wagner cordially acknowledged the fascination which Webers music
exerted on him in his boyhood he was hardly fair to Weber in his later
writings In these he tries to prove that his own musicdramas are an
outgrowth of Beethovens Ninth Symphony When Beethoven wrote that work
Wagner argues he had come to the conclusion that purely instrumental
music had reached a point beyond which it could not go alone wherefore
he called in the aid of poetry sung by soloists and chorus and thus
intimated that the artwork of the future was the musical dramaa
combination of poetry and music
This is a purely fantastic notion on Wagners part There is no evidence
that Beethoven had any such purpose he merely called in the aid of the
human voice to secure variety of sound and expression Poetry and music
had been combined centuries before Beethoven in the opera and in
lyric song
No the roots of Wagners musicdramas are not to be found in Beethoven
but in Weber His Freischutz and Euryanthe are the prototypes of
Wagners operas The Freischutz is the first masterwork as Wagners
operas are the last up to date of the romantic school and it embodies
admirably two of the principal characteristics of that school one a
delight in the demoniac the supernaturalwhat the Germans call
gruseln the other the use of certain instruments alone or in
combination for the sake of securing peculiar emotional effects In
both these respects Wagner followed in Webers footsteps With the
exception of Rienzi and Die Meistersinger all of his operas from
the Flying Dutchman to Parsifal embody supernatural mythical
romantic elements and in the use of novel tone colors for special
emotional effects he opened a new wonderworld of sound to which Weber
however had given him the key
Lohengrin the last one of what are usually called Wagners operas
as distinguished from his musicdramas comprising the last seven of
his works betrays very strongly the influence of Webers other
masterwork Euryanthe This opera indeed may also be called the
direct precursor of Wagners musicdramas It contains eight leading
motives which recur thirty times in course of the opera and the
dramatic recitatives are sometimes quite in the Wagnerian manner But
the most remarkable thing is that Weber uses language which practically
sums up Wagners idea of the musicdrama Euryanthe he says is a
purely dramatic work which depends for its success solely on the
cooperation of the united sisterarts and is certain to lose its
effect if deprived of their assistance
When Wagner wrote his essay on The Music of the Future for the
Parisians 1860 he remembered his obligations to the Dresden idol of
his boyhood by calling attention to the still very noticeable
connection of his early work Tannhauser with the operas of my
predecessors among whom I name especially Weber He might have
mentioned othersGluck for instance who curbed the vanity of the
singers and taught them that they were not the whole show Marschner
whose grewsome Hans Heiling Wagner had in mind when he wrote his
Flying Dutchman Auber whose Masaniello with its dumb heroine
taught Wagner the importance and expressiveness of pantomimic music of
which there are such eloquent examples in all his operas During his
three and a half years sojourn in Paris just at the opening of his
career as an opera composer 18391842 he learned many things
regarding operatic scenery machinery processions and details which
he subsequently turned to good account Even Meyerbeer the ruler of the
musical world in Paris at that time was not without influence on him
though he had cause to disapprove of him because of his submission to
the demands of the fashionable taste of the day which contrasted so
strongly with Wagners own courageous defiance of everything
inconsistent with his ideals of art The result todayMeyerbeers fall
and Wagners triumphshows that courage like honesty is in the long
run the best policy and like virtue its own reward
It is important to bear in mind all these lessons that Wagner learned
from his predecessors as it helps to explain the enormous influence he
exerted on his contemporaries Wonderful as was the power and
originality of his genius even he could not have achieved such results
had he not had truth on his sidetruth as hinted at in moments of
inspiration by many of his predecessors
Wagner was most shamefully misrepresented by his enemies during his
lifetime A thousand times they wrote unblushingly that he despised and
abused the great masters whereas in truth no one ever spoke of them
more enthusiastically than he or was more eager to learn of them
though to be sure he was honest and courageous enough also to call
attention to their shortcomings In all his autobiographic writings
there is not a more luminous passage than the following in which he
relates his experiences as conductor at the Riga Opera in 1838 when he
was at work on Rienzi
The peculiar gnawing melancholy which habitually overpowered me when I
conducted one of our ordinary operas was interrupted by an
inexpressible enthusiastic delight when here and there during the
performance of nobler works I became conscious of the incomparable
effects that can be produced by musicodramatic combinations on the
stageeffects of a depth sincerity and direct realistic vivacity
such as no other art can produce I felt quite elated and ennobled
during the time that I was rehearsing Mehuls enchanting Joseph with
my little opera company Such impressions he continues like
flashes of lightning revealed to him unsuspected possibilities It
was by utilizing these possibilities and hints and at the same time
avoiding the errors and blemishes of his predecessors that his
