INTRODUCTION
Of the many masterpieces which classical antiquity has bequeathed to
modern times few have attained at intervals to such popularity few
have so gripped the interest of scholars and men of letters as has this
scintillating miscellany known as the Satyricon ascribed by tradition to
that Petronius who at the court of Nero acted as arbiter of elegance
and dictator of fashion  The flashing wit the masterly touches which
bring out the characters with all the detail of a fine old copper
etching the marvelous use of realism by this its first prophet the
sure knowledge of the perspective and background best adapted to each
episode the racy style so smooth so elegant so simple when the
educated are speaking beguile the reader and blind him at first to the
many discrepancies and incoherences with which the text as we have it
is marred  The more one concentrates upon this author the more apparent
these faults become and the more one regrets the lacunae in the text
Notwithstanding numerous articles which deal with this work some from
the pens of the most profound scholars its author is still shrouded in
the mists of uncertainty and conjecture  He is as impersonal as
Shakespeare as aloof as Flaubert in the opinion of Charles Whibley
and it may be added as genial as Rabelais an enigmatic genius whose
secret will never be laid bare with the resources at our present command
As I am not writing for scholars I do not intend going very deeply into
the labyrinth of critical controversy which surrounds the author and the
work but I shall deal with a few of the questions which if properly
understood will enhance the value of the Satyricon and contribute in
some degree to a better understanding of the author  For the sake of
convenience the questions discussed in this introduction will be arranged
in the following order
1  The Satyricon
2  The Author
a  His Character
b  His Purpose in Writing
c  Time in which the Action is placed
d  Localization of the Principal Episode
3  Realism
a  Influence of the Satyricon upon the Literature of the World
4  The Forgeries
I
THE SATYRICON  Heinsius and Scaliger derive the word from the Greek
whence comes our English word satyr but Casaubon Dacier and Spanheim
derive it from the Latin satura a plate filled with different kinds
of food and they refer to Porphyrions multis et variis rebus hoc
carmen refertum est
The text as we possess it may be divided into three divisions the
first and last relate the adventures of Encolpius and his companions the
second which is a digression describes the Dinner of Trimalchio  That
the work was originally divided into books we had long known from
ancient glossaries and we learn from the title of the Traguriensian
manuscript that the fragments therein contained are excerpts from the
fifteenth and sixteenth books  An interpolation of Fulgentius Paris
7975 attributes to Book Fourteen the scene related in Chapter 20 of the
work as we have it and the glossary of St Benedict Floriacensis cites
the passage sed video te totum in illa haerere quae Troiae halosin
ostendit Chapter 89 as from Book Fifteen  As there is no reason to
suppose that the chapters intervening between the end of the Cena
Chapter 79 and Chapter 89 are out of place it follows that this
passage may have belonged to Book Sixteen or even Seventeen but that it
could not have belonged to Book Fifteen  From the interpolation of
Fulgentius we may hazard the opinion that the beginning of the fragments
as we possess them Chapters 1 to 26 form part of Book Fourteen  The
Dinner of Trimalchio probably formed a complete book fifteen and the
continuation of the adventures of Encolpius down to his meeting with
Eumolpus end of Chapter 140 Book Sixteen  The discomfiture of Eumolpus
should have closed this book but not the entire work as the exit of the
two principal characters is not fixed at the time our fragments come to
an end  The original work then would probably have exceeded Tom Jones
in length
II
THE AUTHOR
aNot often says Studer Rheinisches Museum 1843 has there been
so much dispute about the author the times the character and the
purpose of a writing of antiquity as about the fragments of the Satyricon
of Petronius  The discovery and publication of the Trau manuscript
brought about a literary controversy which has had few parallels and
which has not entirely died out to this day although the best
authorities ascribe the work to Caius Petronius the Arbiter Elegantiarum
at the court of Nero  The question as to the date of the narrative of
the adventures of Encolpius and his boon companions must be regarded as
settled says Theodor Mommsen Hermes 1878 this narrative is
unsurpassed in originality and mastery of treatment among the writings of
Roman literature  Nor does anyone doubt the identity of its author and
the Arbiter Elegantiarum of Nero whose end Tacitus relates
In any case the author of this work if it be the work of one brain
must have been a profound psychologist a master of realism a
naturalborn story teller and a gentleman
bHis principal object in writing the work was to amuse but in amusing
he also intended to pillory the aristocracy and his wit is as keen as the
point of a rapier but when we bear in mind the fact that he was an
ancient we will find that his cynicism is not cruel in him there is
none of the malignity of Aristophanes there is rather the attitude of
the refined patrician who is always under the necessity of facing those
things which he holds most in contempt the supreme artist who suffers
from the multitude of billboards so to speak who lashes the posters
but holds in pitying contempt those who know so little of true art that
they mistake those posters for the genuine article  Niebuhrs estimate
of his character is so just and free from prejudice and proceeds from
a mind which in itself was so pure and wholesome that I will quote it
All great dramatic poets are endowed with the power of creating beings
who seem to act and speak with perfect independence so that the poet is
nothing more than the relator of what takes place  When Goethe had
conceived Faust and Margarete Mephistopheles and Wagner they moved and
had their being without any exercise of his will  But in the peculiar
power which Petronius exercises in its application to every scene to
every individual character in everything noble or mean which he
undertakes I know of but one who is fully equal to the Roman and that
is Diderot  Trimalchio and Agamemnon might have spoken for Petronius
and the nephew Rameau and the parson Papin for Diderot in every
condition and on every occasion inexhaustibly out of their own nature
just so the purest and noblest souls whose kind was after all not
entirely extinct in their day
Diderot and a contemporary related to him in spirit Count Gaspar
Gozzi are marked with the same cynicism which disfigures the Roman
their age like his had become shameless  But as the two former were in
their heart noble upright and benevolent men and as in the writings of
Diderot genuine virtue and a tenderness unknown to his contemporaries
breathe so the peculiarity of such a genius can as it seems be given
to a noble and elevated being only  The deep contempt for prevailing
immorality which naturally leads to cynicism and a heart which beats for
everything great and gloriousvirtues which then had no existence
speak from the pages of the Roman in a language intelligible to every
susceptible heart
eBeck in his paper The Age of Petronius Arbiter concluded that the
author lived and wrote between the years 6 AD  and 34 AD but he
overlooked the possibility that the author might have lived a few years
later written of conditions as they were in his own times and yet laid
the action of his novel a few years before  Mommsen and Haley place the
time under Augustus Buecheler about 367 AD and Friedlaender under
Nero
dLa Porte du Theil places the scene at Naples because of the fact the
city in which our heroes met Agamemnon must have been of some
considerable size because neither Encolpius nor Asclytos could find their
way back to their inn when once they had left it because both were
tired out from tramping around in search of it and because Giton had been
so impressed with this danger that he took the precaution to mark the
pillars with chalk in order that they might not be lost a second time
The Gulf of Naples is the only bit of coastline which fits the needs of
the novel hence the city must be Naples  The fact that neither of the
characters knew the city proves that they had been recent arrivals and
this furnishes a clue vague though it is to what may have gone before
Haley Harvard Studies in Classical Philology vol II makes out a
very strong case for Puteoli and his theory of the old town and the new
town is as ingenious as it is able  Haley also has Trimalchio in his
favor as has also La Porte du Theil  I saw the Sibyl at Cumae says
Trimalchio  Now if the scene of the dinner is actually at Cumae this
sounds very peculiar it might even be a gloss added by some copyist
whose knowledge was not equal to his industry  On the other hand
suppose Trimalchio is speaking of something so commonplace in his
locality that the second term has become a generic then the difficulty
disappears  We today even though standing upon the very spot in Melos
where the Venus was unearthed would still refer to her as the Venus de
Melos  Friedlaender in bracketing Cumis has not taken this
sufficiently into consideration  Mommsen in an excellent paper Hermes
1878 has laid the scene at Cumae  His logic is almost unanswerable
and the consensus of opinion is in favor of the latter town
III
REALISM  Realism as we are concerned with it may be defined as the
literary effect produced by the marshaling of details in their exactitude
for the purpose of bringing out character  The fact that they may be
ugly and vulgar the reverse makes not the slightest difference  The
modern realist contemplates the inanimate things which surround us with
peculiar complaisance and it is right that he should as these things
exert upon us a constant and secret influence  The workings of the human
mind in complex civilizations are by no means simple they are involved
and varied our thoughts our feelings our wills associate themselves
with an infinite number of sensations and images which play one upon the
other and which individualize in some measure every action we commit
and stamp it  The merit of our modern realists lies in the fact that
they have studied the things which surround us and our relations to them
and thus have they been able to make their creations conform to human
experience  The ancients gave little attention to this the man with
them was the important thing the environment the unimportant  There
are of course exceptions the interview between Ulysses and Nausiskaa
is probably the most striking  From the standpoint of environment
Petronius in the greater portion of his work is an ancient but one
exception there is and it is as brilliant as it is important  The
entire episode in which Trimalchio figures offers an incredible
abundance of details  The descriptions are exhaustive and minute but
the authors prime purpose was not description it was to bring out the
characters it was to pillory the Roman aristocracy it was to amuse
Cicero in his prosecution of Verres had shown up this aristocracy in
all its brutality and greed it remained for the author of the Cena to
hold its absurdity up to the light of day to lash an extravagance which
though utterly unbridled was yet unable to exhaust the looted
accumulations of years of political double dealing and malfeasance in
office  Trimalchios introduction is a masterstroke the porter at the
door is another the effect of the wine upon the women their jealousy
lest eithers husband should seem more liberal their appraisal of each
others jewelry Scintillas remark anent the finesse of Habinnas
servant in the mere matter of pandering the bleareyed and blacktoothed
slave teasing a little bitch disgustingly fat offering her pieces of
bread and when from sheer inability she refuses to eat cramming it
down her throat the effect of the alcohol upon Trimalchio the little
old lady girded round with a filthy apron wearing clogs which were not
mates dragging in a huge dog on a chain the incomparable humor in the
passage in which Hesus desperately seasick sees that which makes him
believe that even worse misfortunes are in store for him these details
are masterpieces of realism  The description of the nightprowling
shyster lawyer whose forehead is covered with sebaceous wens is the
very acme of propriety our first meeting with the poet Eumolpus is a
beautiful study in background and perspective  Nineteen centuries have
gone their way since this novel was written but if we look about us we
will be able to recognize under the veneer of civilization the
originals of the Satyricon and we will find that here in a little corner
of the Roman world all humanity was held in miniature  Petronius must
be credited with the great merit of having introduced realism into the
novel  By an inspiration of genius he saw that the framework of
frivolous and licentious novels could be enlarged until it took in
contemporary custom and environment  It is that which assures for him
an eminent place not in Roman literature alone but in the literature
of the world
aINFLUENCE OF THE SATYRICON UPON LITERATURE  The vagrant heroes of
Petronius are the originals from whom directly or indirectly later
authors drew that inspiration which resulted in the great mass of
picaresque fiction but great as this is it is not to this that the
Satyricon owes its powerful influence upon the literature of the world
It is to the authors recognition of the importance of environment
of the vital role of inanimate surroundings as a means for bringing out
character and imbuing his episodes and the actions of his characters with
an air of reality and with those impulses and actions which are common to
human experience that his influence is due  By this the Roman created
a new style of writing and inaugurated a class of literature which was
without parallel until the time of Apuleius and in a lesser degree of
Lucian  This class of literature though modified essentially from age
to age in keeping with the dictates of moral purity or bigotry innocent
or otherwise has come to be the very stuff of which literary success in
fiction is made  One may write a successful book without a thread of
romance one cannot write a successful romance without some knowledge of
realism the more intimate the knowledge the better the book and it is
frequently to this that the failure of a novel is due although the
critic might be at a loss to explain it  Petronius lies behind Tristram
Shandy his influence can be detected in Smollett and even Fielding paid
tribute to him
IV
FORGERIES OF PETRONIUS
From the very nature of the writings of such an author as Petronius it
is evident that the gaps in the text would have a marked tendency to
stimulate the curiosity of literary forgers and to tempt their sagacity
literary or otherwise  The recovery of the Trimalchionian episode and
the subsequent pamphleteering would by no means eradicate this cacoethes
emendandi
When circa 1650 the library of the unfortunate Nicolas Cippico yielded
up the Trau fragment the news of this discovery spread far and wide and
about twelve years later Statileo in response to the repeated requests
of the Venetian ambassador Pietro Basadonna made with his own hand a
copy of the MS which he sent to Basadonna  The ambassador in turn
permitted this MS to be printed by one Frambotti a printer endowed with
more industry than critical acumen and the resultant textual conflation
had much to do with the pamphlet war which followed  Had this Paduan
printer followed the explicit directions which he received and printed
exactly what was given him much good paper might have been saved and a
very interesting chapter in the history of literary forgery would
probably never have been written  The pamphlet war did not die out until
Bleau in 167071 printed his exact reproduction of the Trau manuscript
and the corrections introduced by that licentiousness of emendation of
which we have spoken
In October 1690 Francois Nodot a French soldier of fortune a
commissary officer who combined belles lettres and philosophy with his
official duties wrote to Charpentier President of the Academy of
France calling his attention to a copy of a manuscript which he Nodot
possessed and which came into his hands in the following manner one
Du Pin a French officer detailed to service with Austria had been
present at the sack of Belgrade in 1688  That this Du Pin had while
there made the acquaintance of a certain Greek renegade having as a
matter of fact stayed in the house of this renegade  The Greeks
father a man of some learning had by some means come into possession of
the MS and Du Pin in going through some of the books in the house had
come across it  He had experienced the utmost difficulty in deciphering
the letters and finally driven by curiosity had retained a copyist and
had it copied out  That this Du Pin had this copy in his house at
Frankfort and that he had given Nodot to understand that if he Nodot
came to Frankfort he would be permitted to see this copy  Owing to the
exigencies of military service Nodot had been unable to go in person to
Frankfort and that he had therefore availed himself of the friendly
interest and services of a certain merchant of Frankfort who had
volunteered to find an amanuensis have a copy made and send it to
Nodot  This was done and Nodot concludes his letter to Charpentier by
requesting the latter to lay the result before the Academy and ask for
their blessing and approval  These Nodotian Supplements were accepted as
authentic by the Academics of Arles and Nimes as well as by Charpentier
In a short time however the voices of scholarly skeptics began to be
heard in the land and accurate and unbiased criticism laid bare the
fraud  The Latinity was attacked and exception taken to Silver Age
prose in which was found a French police regulation which required newly
arrived travellers to register their names in the book of a police
officer of an Italian village of the first century  Although they are
still retained in the text by some editors this is done to give some
measure of continuity to an otherwise interrupted narrative but they can
only serve to distort the author and obscure whatever view of him the
reader might otherwise have reached  They are generally printed between
brackets or in different type
In 1768 another and far abler forger saw the light of day  Jose
Marchena a Spaniard of Jewish extraction was destined for an
ecclesiastical career  He received an excellent education which served
to fortify a natural bent toward languages and historical criticism  In
his early youth he showed a marked preference for uncanonical pursuits
and heretical doctrines and before he had reached his thirtieth year
prudence counseled him to prevent the consequences of his heresy and
avoid the too pressing Inquisition by a timely flight into France
He arrived there in time to throw himself into the fight for liberty
and in 1800 we find him at Basle attached to the staff of General Moreau
While there he is said to have amused himself and some of his cronies by
writing notes on what Davenport would have called Forbidden Subjects
and as a means of publishing his erotic lucubrations he constructed
this fragment which brings in those topics on which he had enlarged
He translated the fragment into French attached his notes and issued
the book  There is another story to the effect that he had been
reprimanded by Moreau for having written a loose song and that he
exculpated himself by assuring the general that it was but a new fragment
of Petronius which he had translated  Two days later he had the fragment
ready to prove his contention
This is the account given by his Spanish biographer  In his preface
dedicated to the Army of the Rhine he states that he found the fragment
in a manuscript of the work of St Gennadius on the Duties of Priests
probably of the XI Century  A close examination revealed the fact that
it was a palimpsest which after treatment permitted the restoration of
this fragment  It is supposed to supply the gap in Chapter 26 after the
word verberabant
Its obscenity outrivals that of the preceding text and the grammar
style and curiosa felicitas Petroniana make it an almost perfect
imitation  There is no internal evidence of forgery  If the text is
closely scrutinized it will be seen that it is composed of words and
expressions taken from various parts of the Satyricon and that in every
line it has exactly the Petronian turn of phrase
Not only is the original edition unprocurable to quote again from
Mr Gaselees invaluable bibliography but the reprint at Soleure
Brussels 1865 consisted of only 120 copies and is hard to find
The most accessible place for English readers is in Bohns translation
in which however only the Latin text is given and the notes were a
most important part of the original work
These notes humorously and perhaps sarcastically ascribed to Lallemand
Sanctae Theologiae Doctor are six in number all on various forms of
vice and show great knowledge classical and sociological of unsavory
subjects  Now that the book is too rare to do us any harm we may admit
that the pastiche was not only highly amusing but showed a perverse
cleverness amounting almost to genius
Marchena died at Madrid in great poverty in 1821  A contemporary has
described him as being rather short and heavy set in figure of great
frontal development and vain beyond belief  He considered himself
invincible where women were concerned  He had a peculiar predilection
in the choice of animal pets and was an object of fear and curiosity
to the towns people  His forgery might have been completely successful
had he not acknowledged it himself within two or three years after the
publication of his brochure  The fragment will remain a permanent
tribute to the excellence of his scholarship but it is his Ode to Christ
Crucified which has made him more generally known and it is one of the
ironies of fate that caused this deformed giant of sarcasm to compose a
poem of such tender and touching piety
Very little is known about Don Joe Antonio Gonzalez de Salas whose
connecting passages with the exception of one which is irrelevant are
here included
The learned editors of the Spanish encyclopedia naively preface their
brief sketch with the following assertion no tenemos noticias de su
vida  De Salas was born in 1588 and died in 1654  His edition of
Petronius was first issued in 1629 and reissued in 1643 with a copper
plate of the Editor  The Paris edition from which he says he supplied
certain deficiencies in the text is unknown to bibliographers and is
supposed to be fictitious
To distinguish the spurious passages as a point of interest in the
present edition the forgeries of Nodot are printed within round
brackets the forgery of Marchena within square brackets and the
additions of De Salas in italics In this PG etext in curly brackets
The work is also accompanied by a translation of the six notes the
composition of which led Marchena to forge the fragment which first
appeared in the year 1800  These have never before been translated

VOLUME 1ADVENTURES OF ENCOLPIUS AND HIS COMPANIONS
CHAPTER THE FIRST
It has been so long since I promised you the story of my adventures
that I have decided to make good my word today and seeing that we have
thus fortunately met not to discuss scientific matters alone but also
to enliven our jolly conversation with witty stories  Fabricius Veiento
has already spoken very cleverly on the errors committed in the name of
religion and shown how priests animated by an hypocritical mania for
prophecy boldly expound mysteries which are too often such to
themselves  But are our rhetoricians tormented by another species of
Furies when they cry I received these wounds while fighting for the
public liberty I lost this eye in your defense give me a guide who will
lead me to my children my limbs are hamstrung and will not hold me up
Even these heroics could be endured if they made easier the road to
eloquence but as it is their sole gain from this ferment of matter and
empty discord of words is that when they step into the Forum they think
they have been carried into another world  And it is my conviction that
the schools are responsible for the gross foolishness of our young men
because in them they see or hear nothing at all of the affairs of
everyday life but only pirates standing in chains upon the shore
tyrants scribbling edicts in which sons are ordered to behead their own
fathers responses from oracles delivered in time of pestilence
ordering the immolation of three or more virgins every word a honied
drop every period sprinkled with poppyseed and sesame
CHAPTER THE SECOND
Those who are brought up on such a diet can no more attain to wisdom than
a kitchen scullion can attain to a keen sense of smell or avoid stinking
of the grease  With your indulgence I will speak out youteachers
are chiefly responsible for the decay of oratory  With your well
modulated and empty tones you have so labored for rhetorical effect that
the body of your speech has lost its vigor and died  Young men did not
learn set speeches in the days when Sophocles and Euripides were
searching for words in which to express themselves  In the days when
Pindar and the nine lyric poets feared to attempt Homeric verse there was
no private tutor to stifle budding genius  I need not cite the poets for
evidence for I do not find that either Plato or Demosthenes was given
to this kind of exercise  A dignified and if I may say it a chaste
style is neither elaborate nor loaded with ornament it rises supreme by
its own natural purity  This windy and highsounding bombast a recent
immigrant to Athens from Asia touched with its breath the aspiring
minds of youth with the effect of some pestilential planet and as soon
as the tradition of the past was broken eloquence halted and was
stricken dumb  Since that who has attained to the sublimity of
Thucydides who rivalled the fame of Hyperides  Not a single poem
has glowed with a healthy color but all of them as though nourished
on the same diet lacked the strength to live to old age  Painting
also suffered the same fate when the presumption of the Egyptians
commercialized that incomparable art  I was holding forth along these
lines one day when Agamemnon came up to us and scanned with a curious
eye a person to whom the audience was listening so closely
CHAPTER THE THIRD
He would not permit me to declaim longer in the portico than he himself
had sweat in the school but exclaimed Your sentiments do not reflect
the public taste young man and you are a lover of common sense which
is still more unusual  For that reason I will not deceive you as to the
secrets of my profession  The teachers who must gibber with lunatics
are by no means to blame for these exercises  Unless they spoke in
accordance with the dictates of their young pupils they would as Cicero
remarks be left alone in the schools  And as designing parasites when
they seek invitations to the tables of the rich have in mind nothing
except what will in their opinion be most acceptable to their audience
for in no other way can they secure their ends save by setting snares
for the earsso it is with the teachers of rhetoric they might be
compared with the fisherman who unless he baits his hook with what he
knows is most appetizing to the little fish may wait all day upon some
rock without the hope of a catch
CHAPTER THE FOURTH
What then is there to do  The parents who are unwilling to permit
their children to undergo a course of training under strict discipline
are the ones who deserve the reproof  In the first place everything
they possess including the children is devoted to ambition  Then that
their wishes may the more quickly be realized they drive these unripe
scholars into the forum and the profession of eloquence than which none
is considered nobler devolves upon boys who are still in the act of
being born  If however they would permit a graded course of study to
be prescribed in order that studious boys might ripen their minds by
diligent reading balance their judgment by precepts of wisdom correct
their compositions with an unsparing pen hear at length what they ought
to imitate and be convinced that nothing can be sublime when it is
designed to catch the fancy of boys then the grand style of oratory
would immediately recover the weight and splendor of its majesty  Now
the boys play in the schools the young men are laughed at in the forum
and a worse symptom than either no one in his old age will confess
the errors he was taught in his school days  But that you may not
imagine that I disapprove of a jingle in the Lucilian manner I will
deliver my opinions in verse
CHAPTER THE FIFTH
The man who emerges with fame from the school of stern art
Whose mind gropes for lofty ideals to bring them to light
Must first under rigid frugality study his part
Nor yearn for the courts of proud princes who frown in their might
Nor scheme with the riffraf a client in order to dine
Nor can he with evil companions his wit drown in wine
Nor sit as a hireling applauding an actors grimace
But whether the fortress of armsbearing Tritonis smile
Upon him or land which the Spartan colonials grace
Or home of the sirens with poetry let him beguile
