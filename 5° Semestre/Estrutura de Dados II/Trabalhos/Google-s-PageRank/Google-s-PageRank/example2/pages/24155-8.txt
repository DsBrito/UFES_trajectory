thoroughly comfortable and wellfed The old gentleman had never been so
comfortable in his life or better fed
He had never been so free from worry Bridie took over the management of
the garden and farm She employed her own relatives There was an ample
supply of them for almost everyone in the village was related to the
Malones She paid good wages but she insisted on getting good work
and she never allowed her husband to trouble about anything
Old Sir Tony found life a much easier business than he had ever found it
before He chuckled when Captain Corless who paid an occasional visit
to Castle Affey pitied him
You think Im a doddering old fool he said but by gad Tony the
most sensible thing I ever did in my life was to marry Bridie Malone
If youre wise youll take on your stepmother as housekeeper here and
general manager after Im gone Not that Im thinking of going Im
seventytwo You know that Tony But living as I do now without a
single thing to bother me Im good for another twenty yearsor thirty
In fact I dont see why the deuce I should ever die at all Its worry
and work which kill men and Ive neither one nor the other
It was Lady Corless custom to spend the evenings with her husband
in the smokingroom When he had dinedand he always dined wellhe
settled down in a large armchair with a decanter of whisky and a box of
cigars beside him
There was always summer and winter a fire burning on the open hearth
There was a good supply of newspapers and magazines for Sir Tony
though he lived apart from the world liked to keep in touch with
politics and the questions of the day Lady Corless sat opposite him on
a much less comfortable chair and knitted stockings If there was any
news in the village she told it to him and he listened for like many
old men he took a deep interest in his neighbours affairs
If there was anything important or curious in the papers he read it out
to her But she very seldom listened Her strong common sense saved her
from taking any interest in the war while it lasted the peace when it
was discussed or politics which gurgle on through war and peace alike
With the care of a great house a garden and eighty acres of land on
her shoulders she had no mental energy to spare for public affairs of
any kind Between halfpast ten and eleven Sir Tony went to bed He was
an old gentleman of regular habits and by that time the whiskydecanter
was always empty Lady Corless helped him upstairs saw to it that
his fire was burning and his pyjamas warm She dealt with buttons and
collarstuds which are sometimes troublesome to old gentlemen who have
drunk port at dinner and whisky afterwards She wound his watch for him
and left him warm and sleeping comfortably
One evening Sir Tony read from an English paper a paragraph which caught
Lady Corless attention It was an account of the means by which the
Government hoped to mitigate the evils of the unemployment likely to
follow demobilisation and the closing of munition works An outofwork
benefit of twentyfive shillings a week struck her as a capital thing
likely to become very popular For the first time in her life she became
slightly interested in politics
Sir Tony passed from that paragraph to another which dealt with the
future of Dantzig Lady Corless at once stopped listening to what he
read She went on knitting her stocking but instead of letting her
thoughts work on the problems of the eggs laid by her hens and the
fish for Sir Tonys dinner the next day she turned over in her mind the
astonishing news that the Government actually proposed to pay people
and to pay them well for not working The thing struck her as too good
to be true and she suspected that there must be some saving clause
some hidden trap which would destroy the value of the whole scheme
After she had put Sir Tony to bed she went back to the smokingroom and
opened the paper from which the news had been read It took her some
time to find the paragraph Her search was rendered difficult by the
fact that the editor much interested apparently in a subject called
the League of Nations had tucked this really important piece of news
into a corner of a back page In the end when she discovered what she
wanted she was not much better off The print was small The words were
long and of a very unusual kind Lady Corless could not satisfy herself
about their meaning She folded the paper up and put it safely into a
drawer in the kitchen dresser before she went to bed
Next day rising early as she always did she fed her fowls and set the
mornings milk in the dairy She got Sir Tonys breakfast ready at
nine oclock and took it up to him She saw to it that Danny who was
inclined to be lazy was in his pantry polishing silver She made it
clear to Sarah Susy and Molly that she really meant the library to
be thoroughly cleaned It was a room which was never occupied and the
three girls saw no sense in sweeping the floor and dusting the backs of
several thousand books But their sister was firm and they had learnt to
obey her
Without troubling to put on a hat or to take off her working apron Lady
Corless got on her bicycle and rode down to her fathers forge She had
in her pocket the newspaper which contained the important paragraph
Old Malone laid aside a cartwheel to which he was fitting a new rim and
followed his daughter into the house He was much better educated than
she was and had been for many years a keen and active politician He
took in the meaning of the paragraph at once
Gosh he said If thats trueand Im not saying it is true but if
it is its the best yet Its whats been wanted in Ireland this long
time
He read the paragraph through again slowly and carefully
Didnt I tell you he said didnt I tell everyone when the election
was on that the Sinn Feiners was the lads to do the trick for us
Didnt I say that without wed get a republic in Ireland the country
would do no good And theres the proof of it
He slapped the paper heartily with his hand To Lady Corless whose mind
was working rapidly his reasoning seemed a little inconclusive It even
struck her that an Irish republic had such a thing really come into
being might not have been able to offer the citizens the glorious
chance of a weekly pension of twentyfive shillings But she was aware
that politics is a complex business in which she was not trained She
said nothing Her father explained his line of thought
If them fellows over in England he said werent terrible frightened
of the Sinn Feiners would they be offering us the likes of that to keep
us quiet Bedamn but they would not Nobody ever got a penny out of
an Englishman yet without hed frightened him first And its the
Sinn Feiners done that Theres the why and the wherefore of it to you
Twentyfive shillings a week It ought to be thirty shillings so it
ought But sure twentyfive shillings is something and Id be in
favour of taking it so I would Let the people of Ireland take it I
say as an instalment of whats due to them and what theyll get in the
latter end please God
Can you make out how a mans to get it said Lady Corless
Man said old Malone Man No but man and woman There isnt a girl
in the country let alone a boy but whats entitled to it and Id like
to see the police or anyone else interfering with them getting it
Will it be paid out of the post office like the Old Age Pensions said
Lady Corless
I dont know will it said her father but that way or some other way
its bound to be paid and all anyone has to do is to go over to what
they call the Labour Exchange at Dunbeg and say theres no work for
him where he lives Then hell get the money Its what the young fellow
in that office is there for is to give the money and by damn if he
doesnt do it therell be more heard about the matter
Old Malone anxious to spread the good news left the room and walked
down to the public house at the corner of the village street Lady
Corless went into the kitchen and found her three youngest sisters
drinking tea They sat on low stools before the fire and had a black
teapot with a broken spout standing on the hearth at their feet The
tea in the pot was very black and strong Lady Corless addressed them
solemnly
KateyAnn she said listen to me now and let you be listening too
Onnie and let Honoria stop scratching her head and attend to what Im
saying to the whole of you Im taking you on up at the big house as
upper housemaid KateyAnn
And whats come over Sarah said KateyAnn Is she going to be
married
Never mind you about Sarah said Lady Corless but attend to me
Youre the underhousemaid Onnie so you are in place of your sister
Susy and Honoria here is kitchenmaid If anyone comes asking you
questions thats what you are and thats what youre to say Do you
understand me now But mind this I dont want you up at the house
neer a one of you Youll stay where you are and youll do what youre
doing looking after your father and drinking tea the same as before
only your wages will be paid regular to you Wheres Thady
Thady Malone was the youngest of the family
Since Dan became butler at Castle Affey Thady had given his father such
help as he could at the forge Lady Corless found him seated beside the
bellows smoking a cigarette His red hair was a tangled shock His face
and hands were extraordinarily dirty He was enjoying a leisure hour or
two while his father was at the public house To his amazement he found
himself engaged as butler and valet to Sir Tony Corless of Castle Affey
But youll not be coming up to the house said Lady Corless neither
by day nor night Mind that Id be ashamed for anyone to see you so I
would for if you washed your face for the Christmas its the last time
you did it
That afternoon after Sir Tonys luncheon had been served Danny Sarah
Susy and Molly were formally dismissed Their insurance cards were
stamped and their wages were paid up to date It was explained to them
at some length with many repetitions but quite clearly that though
dismissed they were to continue to do their work as before The only
difference in their position was that their wages would no longer be
paid by Sir Tony They would receive much larger wages the almost
incredible sum of twentyfive shillings a week from the Government
Next day the four Malones drove over to Dunbeg and applied for
outofwork pay at the Labour Exchange After due inquiries and the
signing of some papers by Lady Corless their claims were admitted
Four farm labourers two gardeners and a groom all cousins of Lady
Corless were dismissed in the course of the following week Seven young
men from the village all of them related to Lady Corless were formally
engaged The insurance cards of the dismissed men were properly stamped
They were indubitably out of work They received unemployment pay
After that the dismissal of servants indoor and out became a regular
feature of life at Castle Affey On Monday morning Lady Corless went
down to the village and dismissed everyone whom she had engaged the week
before Her expenditure in insurance stamps was considerable for she
thought it desirable to stamp all cards for at least a month back
Otherwise her philanthropy did not cost her much and she had very little
trouble The original staff went on doing the work at Castle Affey
After three months every man and woman in the village had passed in and
out of Sir Tonys service and everyone was drawing unemployment pay
The village became extremely prosperous New hats blouses and entire
costumes of the most fashionable kind were to be seen in the streets
every Sunday Large sums of money were lost and won at coursing matches
Nearly everyone had a bicycle and old Malone bought second hand a
rather dilapidated motorcar Work of almost every kind ceased entirely
except in the big house and nobody got out of bed before ten oclock
In mere gratitude rents of houses were paid to Sir Tony which had not
been paid for many years before
Lady Corless finally dismissed herself She did not of course resign
the position of Lady Corless It is doubtful whether she could have got
twentyfive shillings a week if she had The Government does not seem
to have contemplated the case of unemployed wives What she did was to
dismiss Bridie Malone cook at Castle Affey before her marriage She had
been married and therefore technically speaking unemployed for nearly
two years but that did not seem to matter She secured the twentyfive
shillings a week and only just failed to get another five shillings
which she claimed on the ground that her husband was very old and
entirely dependent on her She felt the rejection of this claim to be an
injustice
Captain Corless after a long period of pleasant leisure found
himself suddenly called on to write a report on the working of the
UnemploymentPay Scheme in Ireland With a view to doing his work
thoroughly he hired a motorcar and made a tour of some of the more
picturesque parts of the country He so arranged his journeys that he
was able to stop each night at a place where there was a fairly good
hotel He made careful inquiries everywhere and noted facts for the
enlightenment of the Treasury for whose benefit his report was to be
drawn up He also made notes in a private book of some of the more
amusing and unexpected ways in which the scheme worked He found
himself in the course of his tour close to Castle Affey and being a
dutiful son called on his father
He found old Sir Tony in a particularly good humour He also found
matter enough to fill his private notebook
No telling tales Tony now said the old man No reports about
Castle Affey to the Government Do you hear me now Unless you give me
your word of honour not to breathe what Im going to tell you to anybody
except your friends I wont say a word
I promise of course said Captain Corless
Your stepmothers a wonderful woman said Sir Tony a regular lady
bountiful by Jove You wouldnt believe how rich everybody round here
is now and all through her I give you my word Tony if the whisky was
to be gotwhich of course it isnt nowadaysthere isnt a man
in the place need go to bed sober from one weeks end to another They
could all afford it And its your stepmother who put the money into
their pockets Nobody else would have thought of it Look here youve
heard of this unemploymentpay business I suppose
Im conducting an inquiry about it at the present moment
Then I wont say another word said Sir Tony But its a pity Youd
have enjoyed the story
I neednt put everything Im told into my report said Captain
Corless A good deal of what I hear isnt true
Well then you can just consider my story to be an invention said
Sir Tony
Captain Corless listened to the story When it was finished he shook
hands with his father
Dad he said I apologise to you I saidTheres no harm in
telling you now that I said you were an old fool when you married the
blacksmiths daughter I see now that I was wrong You married the only
woman in Ireland who understands how to make the most of the new law
Why everybody else in your position is cursing this scheme as the ruin
of the country and Lady Corless is the only one whos tumbled to the
idea of using it to make the people happy and contented Shes a great
woman
But dont tell on us Tony said the old man Honour bright now
dont tell
My dear Dad of course not Anyway they wouldnt believe me if I did
II THE STRIKE BREAKER
The train was an hourandaquarter late at Finnabeg Sir James
McClaren alone in a firstclass smoking compartment was not surprised
He had never travelled in Ireland before but he held a belief that time
is very little accounted of west of the ShannonHe looked out of the
window at the rainswept platform It seemed to him that every passenger
except himself was leaving the train at Finnabeg This did not surprise
him much There was only one more station Dunadea the terminus of
the branch line on which Sir James was travelling It lay fifteen miles
further on across a desolate stretch of bog It was not to be supposed
that many people wanted to go to Dunadea
Sir James looking out of his window noticed that the passengers who
alighted did not leave the station They stood in groups on the platform
and talked to each other They took no notice of the rain though it was
very heavy
Now and then one or two of them came to Sir James carriage and peered
in through the window They seemed interested in him A tall young
priest stared at him for a long time Two commercial travellers joined
the priest and looked at Sir James A number of women took the place of
the priest and the commercial travellers when they went away Finally
the guard the engine driver and the station master came and looked in
through the window They withdrew together and sat on a barrow at the
far end of the platform They lit their pipes and consulted together
The priest joined them and offered advice Sir James became a little
impatient
Half an hour passed The engine driver the station master and the
guard knocked the ashes out of their pipes and walked over to Sir James
compartment The guard opened the door
Is it Dunadea youre for your honour he said
Yes said Sir James When are you going on
The guard turned to the engine driver
Its what Im after telling you he said its Dunadea the
gentlemans for
It might be better for him said the engine driver if he was to
content himself with Finnabeg for this day at any rate
Do you hear that your honour said the guard Michael here says it
would be better for you to stay in Finnabeg
Theres a grand hotel so there is said the station master the same
thats kept by Mrs Mulcahy and devil the better youll find between
this and Dublin
Sir James looked from one man to the other in astonishment Nowadays the
public is accustomed to large demands from railway workers demands for
higher wages and shorter hours But Sir James had never before heard of
an engine driver who tried to induce a passenger to get out of his train
fifteen miles short of his destination
I insist he said abruptly on your taking me on to Dunadea
Its what I told you all along Michael said the guard Hes a
mighty determined gentleman so he is I knew that the moment I set eyes
on him
The guard was perfectly right Sir James was a man of most determined
character His career proved it Before the war he had been professor
of economics in a Scottish University lecturing to a class of ten or
twelve students for a salary of 250 a year When peace came he was the
head of a newlycreated Ministry of Strikes controlling a staff of a
thousand or twelve hundred men and women drawing a salary of 2500 a
year Only a man of immense determination can achieve such results He
had garnered in a knighthood as he advanced It was the reward of signal
service to the State when he held the position of Chief Controller of
Information and Statistics
Let him not be saying afterwards that he didnt get a proper warning
said the engine driver
He walked towards his engine as he spoke The guard and the station
master followed him
I suppose now Michael said the guard that youll not be wanting
me
I will not said the engine driver The train will do nicely without
you for as far as Im going to take her
Sir James did not hear either the guards question or the drivers
answer He did hear with great satisfaction what the station master
said next
Are you right there now the man shouted for if you are its time
you were starting
He unrolled a green flag and waved it He blew a shrill blast on his
whistle The driver stepped into the cab of the engine and handled his
levers The train started
Sir James leaned back in the corner of his compartment and smiled The
track over which he travelled was badly laid and the train advanced by
jerks and bumps But the motion was pleasant to Sir James Any forward
movement of that train would have been pleasant to him Each bump and
jerk brought him a little nearer to Dunadea and therefore a little
nearer to Miss Molly Dennison Sir James was very heartily in love with
a girl who seemed to him to be the most beautiful and the most charming
in the whole world Next day such was his good fortune he was to marry
her Under the circumstances a much weaker man than Sir James would
have withstood the engine driver and resisted the invitation of
Mrs Mulcahys hotel in Finnabeg Under the circumstances even an
intellectual man of the professor type was liable to pleasant day
dreams
Sir James thoughts went back to the day six months before when he
had first seen Miss Molly Dennison She had been recommended to him by
a friend as a young lady likely to make an efficient private secretary
Sir James who had just become Head of the Ministry of Strikes wanted a
private secretary He appointed Miss Dennison and saw her for the
first time when she presented herself in his office At that moment his
affection was born It grew and strengthened day by day Miss Mollys
complexion was the radiant product of the soft wet winds of Connaugh
which had blown on her since her birth Not even four years work in
Government offices in London had dulled her cheeks Her smile had the
fresh innocence of a childs and she possessed a curious felicity
of manner which was delightful though a little puzzling Her view of
strikes and the important work of the Ministry was fresh and quite
unconventional Sir James who had all his life moved among serious and
earnest people found Miss Mollys easy cheerfulness very fascinating
Even portentous words like syndicalism which rang in other peoples
ears like the passing bells of our social order moved her to airy
laughter There were those oldish men and slightly less oldish women
who called her flippant Sir James offered her his hand his heart his
title and a share of his 2500 a year Miss Molly accepted all four
resigned her secretaryship and went home to her fathers house in
Dunadea to prepare her trousseau
The train stopped abruptly But even the bump and the ceasing of noise
did not fully arouse Sir James from his pleasant dreams He looked out
of the window and satisfied himself that he had not reached Dunadea
station or indeed any other station The rain ran down the window
glass obscuring his view of the landscape He was dimly aware of a
wide stretch of greybrown bog of drifting grey clouds and of a single
whitewashed cottage near the railway line He lit a cigarette and lay
back again Mollys face floated before his eyes The sound of Mollys
voice was fresh in his memory He thought of the next day and the return
journey across the bog with Molly by his side
At the end of half an hour he awoke to the fact that the train was still
at rest He looked out again and saw nothing except the rain the bog
and the cottage This time he opened the window and put out his head He
looked up the line and down it There was no one to be seen
The signals thought Sir James must be against us He looked again
first out of one window then out of the other There was no signal in
sight The single line of railway ran unbroken across the bog behind
the train and in front of it Sir James puzzled and a little wet drew
back into his compartment and shut the window He waited with rapidly
growing impatience for another half hour Nothing happened Then he saw
a man come out of the cottage near the line He was carrying a basket
in one hand and a teapot in the other He approached the train He
came straight to Sir James compartment and opened the door Sir James
recognised the engine driver
I was thinking said the man that maybe your honour would be glad
of a cup of tea and a bit of bread I am sorry there is no butter but
sure butter is hard to come by these times
He laid the teapot on the floor and put the basket on the seat in front
of Sir James He unpacked it taking out a loaf of home made bread a
teacup a small bottle of milk and a paper full of sugar
Its not much to be offering a gentleman like yourself he said but
its the best we have and seeing that youll be here all night and best
part of tomorrow youll be wanting something to eat
Sir James gasped with astonishment
Here all night he said Why should we be here all night Has the
engine broken down
It has not said the driver
Then you must go on said Sir James I insist on your going on at
once
The driver poured out a cup of tea and handed it to Sir James Then he
sat down and began to talk in a friendly way
Sure I cant go on he said when Im out on strike
Sir James was so startled that he upset a good deal of tea As Head of
the Ministry of Strikes he naturally had great experience but he had
never before heard of a solitary engine driver going on strike in the
middle of a bog
The way of it is this the driver went on It was giv out by them
that does be managing things that there was to be a general strike on
the first of next month You might have heard of that for it was in all
the papers
Sir James had heard of it It was the subject of many notes and reports
in his Ministry
But this isnt the 1st of next month he said
It is not said the driver Its no more than the 15th of this month
But the way Im placed at present it wouldnt be near so convenient to
me to be striking next month as it is to be striking now Theres talk
of moving me off this line and putting me on to the engine that does be
running into Athlone with the night mail and its tomorrow the change
is to be made Now I neednt tell you that Athlones a mighty long way
from where we are this minute
He paused and looked at Sir James with an intelligent smile
My wife lives in the little house beyond there he said pointing out
of the window to the cottage And what I said to myself was this If
I am to be strikingwhich Ive no great wish to dobut if it must
beand seemingly it mustI may as well do it in the convenientest
place I can for as long as a man strikes the way hes told there cant
be a word said to him and anyway the 1st of next month or the 15th of
this month whats the differ Isnt one day as good as another
He evidently felt that his explanation was sufficient and satisfactory
He rose to his feet and opened the door of the compartment
Im sorry now he said if Im causing any inconvenience to a
gentleman like yourself But what can I do I offered to leave you
behind at Finnabeg but you wouldnt stay Anyway the nights warm
and if you stretch yourself on the seat there you wont know it till
morning and then Ill bring you over another cup of tea so as you wont
be hungry Its a twentyfour hour strike so it is and I wont be
moving on out of this before two oclock or may be half past But what
odds The kind of place Dunadea is a day or two doesnt matter one way
or another and if it was the day after tomorrow in place of tomorrow
you got there it would be the same thing in the latter end
He climbed out of the compartment as he spoke and stumped back through
the rain to his cottage Sir James was left wondering how the people
of Dunadea managed to conduct the business of life when one day was
the same to them as another and the loss of a day now and then did not
matter He was quite certain that the loss of a day mattered a great
deal to him his position being what it was He wondered what Miss Molly
Dennison would think when he failed to appear at her fathers house that
evening for dinner what she would thinkthe speculation nearly drove
him madwhen he did not appear in the church next day He put on an
overcoat took an umbrella and set off for the engine drivers cottage
He had to climb down a steep embankment and then cross a wire fence He
found it impossible to keep his umbrella up which distressed him for
he was totally unaccustomed to getting wet
He found the driver who seemed to be a good and domesticated man
sitting at his fireside with a baby on his knee His wife was washing
clothes in a corner of the kitchen
Excuse me said Sir James but my business in Dunadea is very
important There will be serious trouble if
Theres no use asking me to go on with the train said the driver
for I cant do it Id never hear the last of it if I was to be a
blackleg
The woman at the washtub looked up
Dont be talking that way Michael she said let you get up and take
the gentleman along to where he wants to go
I will not said the driver Id do it if I could but I wont have it
said that I was the one to break the strike
It was very much to the credit of Sir James that he recognised the
correctness of the engine drivers position It is not pleasant to be
held up twentyfour hours in the middle of a bog It is most unpleasant
to be kept away from church on ones own wedding day But Sir James
knew that strikes are sacred things far more sacred than weddings He
hastened to agree with the engine driver
I know you cant go on he said nothing would induce me to ask you
such a thing But perhaps
The woman at the washtub did not reverence strikes or understand the
labour movement She spoke abruptly
Have sense the two of you she said Whats to hinder you taking the
gentleman into Dunadea Michael
Its what I cant do nor wont said her husband
Im not asking you to said Sir James I understand strikes
thoroughly and I know you cant do it All I came here for was to ask
you to tell me where I could find a telegraph office
Theres no telegraphic office nearer than Dunadea said the engine
driver and thats seven miles along the railway and maybe nine if you
go round by road
Sir James looked out at the rain It was thick and persistent A strong
west wind swept it in sheets across the bog He was a man of strong will
and great intellectual power but he doubted if he could walk even seven
miles along the sleepers of a railway line against half a gale of wind
wearing on his feet a pair of patent leather boots bought for a wedding
Get up out of that Michael said the woman And off with you to
Dunadea with the gentlemans telegram Youll break no strike by doing
that so not another word out of your head
IllIll give you ten shillings with pleasure said Sir James
Ill give you a pound if youll take a message for me to Mr Dennisons
house
Anything your honour chooses to give said the woman will be
welcome for we are poor people But its my opinion that Michael ought
to do it for nothing seeing its him and his old strike that has things
the way they are
To listen to you talking said the driver anybody would think Id
made the strike myself which isnt true at all for theres not a man
in the country that wants it less than me
Sir James tore a leaf from his note book and wrote a hurried letter to
Miss Dennison The engine driver tucked it into the breast pocket of his
coat and trudged away through the rain His wife invited Sir James to
