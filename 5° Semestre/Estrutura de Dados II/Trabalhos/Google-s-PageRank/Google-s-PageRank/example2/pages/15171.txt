NOTICE OF WILLIAM GRIFFITH from the Proceedings of the Linnaean Society
with a few extracts from his private correspondence
WILLIAM GRIFFITH Esq the youngest son of the late Thomas Griffith
was born on the 4th of March 1810 at his fathers residence at Ham
Common near KingstonuponThames in the county of Surrey
He was educated for the Medical profession and completed his studies at
the London University where he became a pupil of Prof Lindley under
whose able instructions assisted by the zealous friendship of Mr R H
Solly and in conjunction with two fellow pupils of great scientific
promise Mr Slack and Mr Valentine he made rapid progress in the
acquisition of botanical knowledge  The first public proofs that he gave
of his abilities are contained in a microscopic delineation of the
structure of the wood and an analysis of the flower of Phytocrene
gigantea in the third volume of Dr Wallichs Plantae Asiaticae
Rariores and in a note on the development and structure of Targionia
hypophylla appended to M de Mirbels Dissertation on Marchantia
polymorpha both published in 1832  So highly were his talents as an
observer appreciated at this early period that Dr Wallich speaks of him
as one whose extraordinary talents and knowledge as a botanist entitle
him to the respect of all lovers of the science and M de Mirbel
characterizes him as jeune Anglois tres instruit tres zele et fort bon
observateur
His note on Targionia is dated Paris April 2nd 1832 and in the
month of May of the same year having finished his studies at the London
University with great distinction he sailed from England for India
which was destined to be the scene of his future labours  He arrived at
Madras on the 24th of September and immediately received his appointment
as AssistantSurgeon in the service of the East India Company
His first appointment in India was to the coast of Tenasserim but in
the year 1835 he was attached to the Bengal Presidency and was selected
to form one of a deputation consisting of Dr Wallich and himself as
botanists and Mr MacClelland as geologist to visit and inspect the Tea
forests as they were called of Assam and to make researches in the
natural history of that almost unexplored district
This mission was for Mr Griffith the commencement of a series of
journeys in pursuit of botanical knowledge embracing nearly the whole
extent of the East India Companys extrapeninsular possessions and
adding large collections in every branch of natural history but
especially botany to those which under the auspices of the Indian
Government had previously been formed  He next under the directions of
Capt Jenkins the Commissioner pushed his investigations to the utmost
eastern limit of the Companys territory traversing the hitherto
unexplored tracts in the neighbourhood of the Mishmee mountains which lie
between Suddiya and Ava  Of the splendid collection of insects formed
during this part of his tour some account has been given by Mr Hope in
the Transactions of the Entomological Society and in the eighteenth
volume of our own Transactions
His collection of plants was also largely increased on this remarkable
journey which was followed by a still more perilous expedition
commenced in February of the following year from Assam through the
Burmese dominions to Ava and down the Irrawadi to Rangoon in the course
of which he was reported to have been assassinated  The hardships
through which he passed during the journey and his excessive application
produced soon after his arrival in Calcutta a severe attack of fever
on his recovery from which he was appointed Surgeon to the Embassy to
Bootan then about to depart under the charge of the late Major
Pemberton  He took this opportunity of revisiting the Khasiya Hills
among which he formed a most extensive collection and having joined
Major Pemberton at Goalpara traversed with him above 400 miles of the
Bootan country from which he returned to Calcutta about the end of June
1839  In November of the same year he joined the army of the Indus in a
scientific capacity and penetrated after the subjugation of Cabool
beyond the Hindoo Khoosh into Khorassan from whence as well as from
Affghanistan he brought collections of great value and extent  During
these arduous journeys his health had several times suffered most
severely and he was more than once reduced by fever to a state of
extreme exhaustion but up to this time the strength of his constitution
enabled him to triumph over the attacks of disease and the energy of his
mind was so great that the first days of convalescence found him again
as actively employed as ever
On his return to Calcutta in August 1841 after visiting Simla and the
Nerbudda he was appointed to the medical duties at Malacca but Dr
Wallich having proceeded to the Cape for the reestablishment of his
health Mr Griffith was recalled in August 1842 to take during his
absence the superintendence of the Botanic Garden near Calcutta in
conjunction with which he also discharged the duties of Botanical
Professor in the Medical College to the great advantage of the students
Towards the end of 1844 Dr Wallich resumed his functions at the Botanic
Garden  In September Mr Griffith married Miss Henderson the sister of
the wife of his brother Captain Griffith and on the 11th of December he
quitted Calcutta to return to Malacca where he arrived on the 9th of
January in the present year  On the 31st of the same month he was
attacked by hepatitis and notwithstanding every attention on the part of
the medical officer who had officiated during his absence and who
fortunately still remained he gradually sunk under the attack which
terminated fatally on the 9th of February  His constitution says his
attached friend Mr MacClelland in a letter to Dr Horsfield seemed
for the last two or three years greatly shattered his energies alone
remaining unchanged  Exposure during his former journeys and travels
laid the seeds of his fatal malady in his constitution while his anxiety
about his pursuits and his zeal increased  He became careworn and
haggard in his looks often complaining of anomalous symptoms marked by
an extreme rapidity of pulse in consequence of which he had left off
wine for some years past and was obliged to observe great care and
attention in his diet  In Affghanistan he was very nearly carried off by
fever to which he had been subject in his former travels in Assam  No
government ever had a more devoted or zealous servant and I impute much
of the evil consequences to his health to his attempting more than the
means at his disposal enabled him to accomplish with justice to himself
The most important of Mr Griffiths published memoirs are contained in
the Transactions of the Linnaean Society  Previous to starting on his
mission to Assam he communicated to the Society the first two of a
series of valuable papers on the development of the vegetable ovulum in
Santalum Loranthus Viscum and some other plants the anomalous
structure of which appeared calculated to throw light on this still
obscure and difficult subject  These papers are entitled as follows
1  On the Ovulum of Santalum album  Linn Trans xviii  p 57
2  Notes on the Development of the Ovulum of Loranthus and Viscum
and on the mode of Parasitism of these two genera  Linn Trans xviii
p 71
3  On the Ovulum of Santalum Osyris Loranthus and Viscum
Linn Trans xix p 171
Another memoir or rather series of memoirs On the RootParasites
referred by authors to Rhizantheae and on various plants related to
them occupies the first place in the Part of our Transactions which is
now in the press with the exception of the portion relating to
Balanophoreae unavoidably deferred to the next following Part  In
this memoir as in those which preceded it Mr Griffith deals with some
of the most obscure and difficult questions of vegetable physiology on
which his minute and elaborate researches into the singularly anomalous
structure of the curious plants referred to will be found to have thrown
much new and valuable light
In India on his return from his Assamese journey he published in the
Transactions of the Agricultural Society of Calcutta a Report on the
Teaplant of Upper Assam which although for reasons stated avowedly
incomplete contains a large amount of useful information on a subject
which was then considered of great practical importance  He also
published in the Asiatic Researches in the Journal of the Asiatic
Society of Bengal and in the Transactions of the Medical and Physical
Society of Calcutta numerous valuable botanical papers but the most
important of his Indian publications are contained in the Calcutta
Journal of Natural History edited jointly by Mr MacClelland and
himself  Of these it may be sufficient at present to refer to his memoir
On Azolla and Salvinia two very remarkable plants which he has
most elaborately illustrated and in relation to which he has entered
into some very curious speculations and his still unfinished monograph
of The Palms of British India which promises to be a highly important
contribution to our knowledge of a group hitherto almost a sealed book to
European Botanists
But the great object of his life that for which all his other labours
were but a preparation was the publication of a General Scientific Flora
of India a task of immense extent labour and importance  To the
acquisition of materials for this task in the shape of collections
dissections drawings and descriptions made under the most favourable
circumstances he had devoted twelve years of unremitted exertion  His
own collections not including those formed in Cabool and the
neighbouring countries he estimated at 2500 species from the Khasiya
Hills 2000 from the Tenasserim provinces 1000 from the province of
Assam 1200 from the Himalaya range in the Mishmee country 1700 from the
same great range in the country of Bootan 1000 from the neighbourhood of
Calcutta and 1200 from the Naga Hills at the extreme east of Upper
Assam from the valley of Hookhoong the district of Mogam and from the
tract of the Irrawadi between Mogam and Ava  Even after making large
deductions from the sumtotal of these numbers on account of the forms
common to two or more of the collections the amount of materials thus
brought together by one man must be regarded as enormous  The time was
approaching when he believed that he could render these vast collections
subservient to the great end which he had in view  He had some time
since issued an invitation to many eminent botanists in Europe to
cooperate with him in the elaboration of particular families and he
purposed after a few years additional residence in India to return to
England with all his materials and to occupy himself in giving to the
world the results of his unwearied labours  But this purpose was not
destined to be fulfilled his collections have passed by his directions
into the hands of the East India Company and there can be no doubt from
the wellknown liberality of the Directors which this Society in
particular has so often experienced that they will be so disposed of by
that enlightened body as to fulfil at once the demands of science and the
last wishes of the faithful and devoted servant by whom they were formed
It is hoped too that the most important of his unpublished materials
both in drawings and manuscripts will be given to the world in a manner
worthy of the author and of the rank in science which he
filledProceedings of the Linnaean Society No xxv 1845
To the foregoing brief sketch which was read before the Linnaean Society
at the Anniversary Meeting 24th May 1845 it is scarcely necessary to
make any addition  It is worthy of remark however as showing how
talents sometimes run in families that Mr Griffith was great grandson
of Jeremiah Meyer Historical Painter to George the Second and one of
the founders of the Royal Academy  It is also but fair to state on the
present occasion that he was not himself the only member of the family
who would appear to have inherited something of his grandfathers
peculiar art as we owe the transfer of the landscapes to stone which
add so much to the appearance of the following volume to the talent and
kindness of his sister
It may perhaps be acceptable in this place to afford a few extracts from
the private letters of Mr Griffith especially those in which he adverts
with a liberality of feeling to his contemporaries no less honourable to
himself than to the persons mentioned
The following notes addressed to his uncle at various periods exhibit
the sentiments with which he regarded the late Mr Bauer not merely as an
artist but original observer
From letters of Mr GRIFFITH to Mr MEYER
Mergui January 17th 1835
My last accounts of Mr Bauer state him to have been in excellent
health he had just completed some more of his unrivalled drawings
Suddya December 30th 1836
Pray give the compliments of the season to Mr Bauer to whom I look up
with the greatest admiration what a pity it is for science that such a
life as his is not renewable ad libitum  Tell him that I have a
beautiful new genus allied to Rafflesia the flowers of which are about a
span across it is dioecious and icosandrous and has an abominable
smell  How I look back occasionally on my frequent and delightful visits
to Kew
To MRS H
Serampore Calcutta July 22nd
1841
I was aware of the departure of Mr Bauer through the Athenaeum in
which an excellent notice of him appeared  He certainly was a man to
whom I looked up with constant admiration he was incomparable in several
respects and I am happy to find that his death was so characteristic of
his most inoffensive and meritorious life  It is also very pleasing to
me to find that he continued to think well of me  How I should have been
able to delight him had he lived a few years longer
Calcutta June 1843
Poor Mr Bauer we never shall see his like again I have seen but few
notices of his life which assuredly is worthy of study  There is not a
place I shall visit with better feelings than Kew it has so many
pleasant associations even from my schooldays
Calcutta December 31st 1843
Mr Bauer is not half appreciated yet he is considered a very great
artist but what is that to what he was  But he did not fight for his
own hand though he worked hard enough in all conscience  Mr Bauer in
fact preceded all in the train of discovery he saw in 1797 what others
did not see till 30 years after  For instance the elongation of the
pollens inner membrane into a tube the first step towards the
complete knowledge we now have of vegetable embryogeny  Unfortunately
Mr Bauer drew but did not write and when I recall to mind a remark of
Mr Brown that it was a disadvantage to be able to draw I always fancy
he had Bauer in his minds eye for had he been a writer and not a
drawer before 1800 in great probability we should have known nearly as
much of embryogeny as we do now  But he shut his portfolio and folks
went on believing the old fovivillose doctrine and bursting of the
pollen which his observations of the pollens inner membrane would
have destroyed at once  Then with regard to Orchideae and Asclepiadeae
he was equally in advance it would be a rich treat if some one would
come forward and publish a selection from his drawings without a word of
letterpress
Calcutta February 11th 1844
Mr Bauers light is not yet set on the hill  Really when I look back
at his works I am lost in admiration and always regret that he worked
more for others than for himself and that he did not use his pen as
freely as he did his brush  When in the name of all that is generous
will great men think that true greatness consist in endeavouring to make
others more prominent than themselves
For some years before his death Mr Griffith would appear to have had a
presentiment that he would not be spared to complete the description of
all his collections  On one occasion when enumerating those who might
contribute most efficiently to this object in the event of its not being
permitted to himself he writes
I cannot however refrain from paying my tribute of respect to Mr George
Bentham the most industrious perspicuous and philosophical Botanist
who has systematically contributed to lessen the difficulties under which
Indian Botanists have generally suffered
There are a few others from whom the sincerity of friendship fully
warrants me in expecting every possible assistance of these Dr Wight is
already well known and others are rising rapidly to fill I hope the
highest Botanical stations when these shall have been vacated by the
leviathans who now occupy them  Let not the cynic accuse me of
partiality when I mention the names of William Valentine of Decaisne
and C M Lemann
He also delighted to speak and write in terms of the warmest regard of
those to whom he was indebted for facilities in his pursuits  To Lord
Auckland he invariably alluded in terms of the deepest gratitudeUnder
his Lordships patronage he remarks on one occasion I have received
such advantages as make me ashamed of the little I have done and which
are constantly holding up before me my deficiencies in many branches of
enquiry connected with the physiology and distribution of plants
The following letters are quoted chiefly for the additional information
they afford on the subject of his travels and pursuits  His letters to
Botanists would of course be more important and interesting
Suddyah 16th September 1836
I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of the cold weather as on the 1st
of November I hope to accompany  to Ava but in the meantime I
intend proceeding in search of the tea plant to the Mishmee Hills
especially about Bramakoond where it is reported to grow  If I find it
there I will endeavour to trace it up into the mountains which form due
east of this an amphitheatre of high rugged peaks
November 1st 1836
I here write from the foot of the dreaded Mishmee Hills  I left
Suddyah on the 15th October and have already been to Bramakoond where I
spent three days  I miss you much you would have been delighted with
the place which is nothing but rocks and hills  I am recruiting my
resources for a movement into the interior of the hills in which I shall
follow Wilcoxs route taking with me 15 coolies for whom I am
collecting grain  I have already made considerable collections chiefly
however in Botany with a few stones and birds  I hope before my return
to have seen Coptis teeta in flower and to have proved that the Beese is
different from that of Nepal  I have already seen numbers of the
Mishmees who are civil people  I have however had great difficulties
with the Chief of the Khond who though apparently friendly will I
fear do all he can to hinder me from getting to Ghaloom with the Gham
of which place I wish to have a conference
Noa Dihing Mookh January 20th
1837
I have just returned from the trip to the Lohit much sooner than I
expected  I saw nothing of any consequence except rapids which are
horrid things and make one quite nervous  I made a beautiful collection
on the Mishmee mountains of which more anon  Many of the plants are
very interesting  I was however worked very hard all my people being
sick I had even to wash my own clothes but I fear you will think I am
grumbling so goodbye
Loodianah 11th December 1838
I arrived here in 145 days notwithstanding some delays on the road
and have put up with Cornet Robinson Acting Political Agent  I am not
pleased with the upcountry and would rather live in Bengal for I
cannot abide sandy plains and a deficiency of vegetation  Loodianah is a
curious place very striking to a stranger the town is large built
under official direction and consequently well arranged in comparison
with native towns there is much trade carried on in it and it has the
usual bustle of a large town
Capt Wades house is well situated on a rising ground and the demesne
is a pretty one  Otherwise the country is ugly enough and very bare
yet it is here well wooded in comparison with what I hear of Ferozepore
Along the face of the hill near the town a nullah flows abounding in
fish of which more anon  The rock pigeons or grouse are very
abundant and there are two species one remarkable for the elongated
sidefeathers of the tail  Both are beautiful birds but very difficult
of access  Crows kites vultures adjutants herons Drongoles
sparrows parrots etc remain as before but most of the less common
birds are different from those to the south the most European are
genuine starlings and to my memory of eight years back identical with
those of Europe  I have already got thirty to forty species of fish
Cyprinidae are by far the most common one loach and one of
Macrognathus
But as they are all from one water viz the neighbouring nullah and
the Sutledge being five miles off I shall put them all into bottles and
send them off before I leave this  The most edible fish and one of the
most common is the Roh but it is not the Roh of Bengal and might well
be called Cyprinus ruber  Burnes has given I think a drawing of it
which is faithful as to colour  All the forms will be familiar to you
but I hope there will be some new species
I have made further arrangements and such as will give you a good
insight into the fish of the Sutledge as to the number of duplicatesit
is the safest plan for an ignoramus not to discriminate too nicely  I am
today to get large specimens of the Kalabans Rohi etc what a splendid
fish the Rohi is both to look at and to eat  There are two or three
species of the transparent Chandas and three or four Perilamps six or
eight Siluridae besides the Gwali which is too large of Ophiocephalus
two or three exclusive of the Sowli but all ought to be examined as
there is no relying on native discrimination  There is a curious animal
here burrowing like a mole but more like a rat of this I have not yet
got a specimen although they are very common
I commence with a list of the fish of this place  I have only to
mention that several species are confounded under the name Bhoor all the
Chandras under Chunda Begla Loaches under Pote all the Perilamps except
the Chulwa which may be from its flavour a Clupeia etc  The fact is
that the fishermen are aware of genera but not of species excepting
when the distinctive marks are very strong  The fisherman enumerates
forty species but I have only twentysix I have promised him one rupee
when he completes the list

Candahar May the 2nd 1839
We have seen three changes in the geological structure of the country
The Khojah Omrah was chiefly clay slate and we are now in another
formation which no one seems to know but it must be different as the
outlines of the hills are completely changed  We are now 3500 feet
above the sea  The climate is good and would be delightful in a good
house but in tents the thermometer varies from 60 to 98 degrees and even
105 degrees
I have got a decent collection of plants only amounting however to 650
species  The flora continues quite European  I have some of singular
interest  Compositae Cruciferae and Gramineae form the bulk of the
vegetation  All fish are very different from those below the Ghats  I
have five or six species of Cyprinidae  One very inimitable fuscous
loach  There are few birds and fewer quadrupeds in fact the country is
at a minimum in both these respects
Ghuzni July 25th 1839
We have been gradually ascending since leaving Candahar and are here at
an elevation of 7600 feet  The same features continue  I have as yet
not more than 850 species  The mountains on every side and indeed the
whole face of the country is still bare  Mookloor a district through
which we passed about seventy miles from this is well cultivated and
inhabited  There are few birds to be seen and scarcely any insects but
there are numerous lizards  The thermometer varies in tents from 60  to
90 degrees
Cabul August 11th 1839
I am encamped close to Babers tomb lulled by the sound of falling
water and cooled with the shade of poplar and sycamore trees with
abundance of delicious fruit and altogether quite happy for the nonce  I
have not yet seen the town which is a strange place buried in gardens
but nothing can exceed the rich cultivation of the valley in which we are
encamped  Beautiful fields on every side with streamlets rich verdure
poplars willows and bold mountain scenery which contrasts most
favourably with the dreary barren tracts to which we have been
accustomed  I go with the Engineers to Bamean in the course of a few
days when we shall cross ridges of 12000 to 13000 feet high
I can only find three kinds of fish in this neighbourhood  I have been
making some drawings and collecting a few plants which continue to be
entirely European
Peshawur November 17th 1839
I hope some day or other to turn out a real traveller  I am now in
hopes of becoming a decent surveyor and before many years have passed a
decent meteorologist  I leave the Army here and shall part with it
particularly Thomson and Durand of the Engineers with regret  I start
in a short time to travel up the Indus with little before me but
difficulties however a la renommee  If I can do something
unparalleled in the travelling way I shall be content for a year or two
at least
I have obtained some few specimens of fossil shells from the shingly
beds of the Khyber Pass  They seem to be a Spirifer with a very square
base quite different from the common species of the Bolan Pass which is
like a large cockle and of which I have one beautiful specimen  How I
regret not seeing Bukkur for with a few days leisure a number of
fossils might be obtained  The older I grow the less content am I
scientifically would that I had received a mathematical education  I
was much interested with some quotations from Lyells Elements in a late
Calcutta Courier especially about the Marine Saurian from the
Gallepagos  What further proof can be wanted of the maritime and insular
nature of the world during the reigns of the Saurian reptiles  What more
conclusive can be expected about the appearance of new species  This
point would at once be settled if the formation of these islands can be
proved not to have been contemporaneous with the Continents  Then the
animal nature of chalk
I am doing nothing in botany but learning Persian and the use of the
theodolite with nothing but difficulties to look at all around  I begin
to feel of such importance do not think me conceited in relation to my
collections and information on geographical botany that I am not
overpleased with the idea of facing dangers alone however I suppose
every thing is as usual exaggerated
Bamean August 3rd 1840
Yesterday I crossed the Hindookoosh by my former route and this
morning while out ie trout fishing was most agreeably interrupted by
the post  The fishing was ended forthwith  Indeed the sun in this
country even at elevations of 12000 feet is very hot and has excoriated
my hands beautifully white as they were after my sickness but not
before I had caught 3 barbels evidently different from those of the
other side of the range  I caught some trout yesterday evening it is a
most beautiful fish I was particularly struck with the size of the eye
its prominence and expressive pupil in opposition to the sluggishness
of the eyes of carps
It is strange that Botany has always been the most favoured of the
natural sciences it is strange that in spite of what all do say it is
the least advanced of any  How can I reconcile my own splendid
opportunities with those of more deserving naturalists in other branches
and I would willingly share them on the principle of common fairness with
others who I know would turn them to a better account  Oreinus takes
the worm greedily in the Helmund 11000 feet above the sea it is
abundant  It is the same species I think as that in the Cabul river but
in the Cabul river Barbus is the predominant fish in the Helmund it is
the reverse  How can one account for the small elevation at which fish
are found in the Himalayan  I cannot imagine it is owing as some think
to the relative impetuosity of the rivers which after all is only an
assumption
This Bamean valley is the strangest place imaginable its barrenness and
the variegated colours of the rocks convey the idea of its volcanic
origin and give it a look as if it had come out of the furnace  I
cannot make out where the stones so universally found all over the slopes
of the mountains came from for very generally they seem waterworn  I
