PREFACE
The publication in 1814 of a voyage commenced in 1801 and of which all
the essential parts were concluded within three years requires some
explanation Shipwreck and a long imprisonment prevented my arrival in
England until the latter end of 1810 much had then been done to forward
the account and the charts in particular were nearly prepared for the
engraver but it was desirable that the astronomical observations upon
which so much depended should undergo a recalculation and the lunar
distances have the advantage of being compared with the observations made
at the same time at Greenwich and in July 1811 the necessary authority
was obtained from the Board of Longitude A considerable delay hence
arose and it was prolonged by the Greenwich observations being found to
differ so much from the calculated places of the sun and moon given in
the Nautical Almanacks of 1801 2 and 3 as to make considerable
alterations in the longitudes of places settled during the voyage and a
reconstruction of all the charts becoming thence indispensable to
accuracy I wished also to employ in it corrections of another kind
which before had been adopted only in some particular instances
A variety of observations with the compass had shown the magnetic needle
to differ from itself sometimes as much as six and even seven degrees
in or very near the same place and the differences appeared to be
subject to regular laws but it was so extraordinary in the present
advanced state of navigation that they should not have been before
discovered and a mode of preventing or correcting them ascertained that
my deductions and almost the facts were distrusted and in the first
construction of the charts I had feared to deviate much from the usual
practice Application was now made to the Admiralty for experiments to be
tried with the compass on board different ships and the results in five
cases being conformable to one of the three laws before deduced which
alone was susceptible of proof in England the whole were adopted without
reserve and the variations and bearings taken throughout the voyage
underwent a systematic correction From these causes the reconstruction
of the charts could not be commenced before 1813 which when the extent
of them is considered will explain why the publication did not take
place sooner but it is hoped that the advantage in point of accuracy
will amply compensate the delay
Besides correcting the lunar distances and the variations and bearings
there are some other particulars both in the account of the voyage and
in the Atlas where the practice of former navigators has not been
strictly followed Latitudes longitudes and bearings so important to
the seaman and uninteresting to the general reader have hitherto been
interwoven in the text they are here commonly separated from it by
which the one will be enabled to find them more readily and the other
perceive at a glance what may be passed I heard it declared that a man
who published a quarto volume without an index ought to be set in the
pillory and being unwilling to incur the full rigour of this sentence a
running title has been affixed to all the pages on one side is expressed
the country or coast and on the opposite the particular part where the
ship is at anchor or which is the immediate subject of examination this
it is hoped will answer the main purpose of an index without swelling
the volumes Longitude is one of the most essential but at the same time
least certain data in hydrography the man of science therefore
requires something more than the general result of observations before
giving his unqualified assent to their accuracy and the progress of
knowledge has of late been such that a commander now wishes to know the
foundation upon which he is to rest his confidence and the safety of his
ship to comply with this laudable desire the particular results of the
observations by which the most important points on each coast are fixed
in longitude as also the means used to obtain them are given at the end
of the volume wherein that coast is described as being there of most
easy reference
The deviations in the Atlas from former practice or rather the
additional marks used are intended to make the charts contain as full a
journal of the voyage as can be conveyed in this form a chart is the
seamans great and often sole guide and if the information in it can be
rendered more complete without introducing confusion the advantage will
be admitted by those who are not opposers of all improvement In closely
following a track laid down upon a chart seamen often run at night
unsuspicious of danger if none be marked but some parts of that track
were run in the night also and there may consequently be rocks or
shoals as near even as half a mile which might prove fatal to them it
therefore seems proper that night tracks should be distinguished from
those of the day and they are so in this Atlas I believe for the first
time A distinction is made between the situations at noon where the
latitude was observed and those in which none could be obtained and the
positions fixed in longitude by the time keepers are also marked in the
track as are the few points where a latitude was obtained from the moon
It has appeared to me that to show the direction and strength of the
winds with the kind of weather we had when running along these coasts
would be an useful addition to the charts not only as it would enable
those who may navigate by them alone to form a judgment of what is to be
expected at the same season but also that it may be seen how far
circumstances prevented several parts of the coast being laid down so
correctly as others This has been done by single arrows wherever they
could be marked without confusion they are more or less feathered
proportionate to the strength of wind intended to be expressed and the
arrows themselves give the direction Under each is a short or abridged
word denoting the weather when this weather prevailed in a more than
usual degree a line is drawn under the word and when in an excessive
degree there are two lines Single arrows being thus appropriated to the
winds the tides and currents are shown by double arrows between which
is usually marked the rate per hour
On the land the shading of the hills gives a general idea of their
elevation and it has been assisted by saying how far particular hills
and capes are visible from a ships deck in fine weather this will be
useful to a seaman on first making the land be a better criterion to
judge of its height and those hills not so marked may be more nearly
estimated by comparison Behind different parts of the coast is given a
short description of their appearance which it is conceived will be
gratifying to scientific and useful to professional men The capes and
hills whose positions are fixed by cross bearings taken on shore or from
well ascertained points in the track as also the stations whence
bearings were observed with a theodolite have distinguishing marks
which with all others not before in common use are explained on the
General Chart Plate I
To have laid down no more than the lands and dangers seen in the
Investigator and other vessels under my command would have left several
open spaces and obliged the seaman to have recourse to other charts
where the difference of positions might have perplexed the discoveries
and examinations of former navigators which come within the sphere of
each sheet are therefore incorporated with or added to mine but so
marked as to be distinctly known In making the combination alterations
in their longitudes were frequently necessary to agreement and that they
might be made with every regard to accuracy the charts of the former
discoveries were compared with the astronomical observations narratives
or manuscript journals when such could be had and the alterations
introduced where there seemed to be the best authority This has been
done with the charts of the east coast of New South Wales published by
Mr Dalrymple from the manuscripts as it should appear of captain Cook
and since it may be thought presumptuous in me to have made alterations
in any work of so great a master this case is selected for a more
particular explanation
Time keepers were in their infancy in 1768 when captain Cook sailed upon
his first voyage and he was not then furnished with them his longitude
was therefore regulated only by occasional observations of lunar
distances and some few of Jupiters satellites which even in the present
improved state of instruments and tables require to be connected by time
keepers before satisfactory conclusions can be drawn Errors of greater
or less magnitude were thence unavoidable at Cape Gloucester where I
quitted the East Coast my longitude was 2012 greater than captain Cooks
chartat Cape York where the survey was again resumed it was 5812 and
to incorporate the intermediate parts it was necessary not only to carry
his scale of longitude 2012 more west but also to reduce the extent of
the coast The chart was compared with the narrative and chart in
Hawkesworth and the log book of the Endeavour with them all when it was
found that reductions might be made in various places upon one or more of
the above authorities for differences between them were frequent and
sometimes considerable and in one instance alone a reduction of 12 in
the chart was obtained It is said in Hawkesworth III 202 As soon as
we got within side the reef through Providential Channel we anchored in
nineteen fathom and afterwards p 204 that the channel bore E N
E distant ten or twelve miles In the first chart the distance is 1412
miles and nearly the same in that which accompanies the narrative but
in the log book it is said to be 212 miles only which corresponds with
having anchored as soon as they got within the reef and has been
adopted In some cases it was not easy to make a choice between these
different authorities but I have commonly followed the narrative and log
book when they were found to specify with precision and they generally
produced such corrections to the chart as brought the longitudes of
places nearer to my positions Captain Cooks track in Plates XI XII
and XIII is laid down afresh from the log book and many soundings with
some other useful particulars not to be found in the original chart are
introduced for the benefit of any navigator who may follow the same
route
The reconstruction of the charts in the Atlas was done upon various
scales but that no error might escape unseen the least was of ten
inches to a degree of longitude they were then reduced by Mr Thomas
Arrowsmith to four inches this being thought sufficiently large for a
general sailing scale and each reduced sheet was scrupulously compared
by me with the original before it went into the engravers hands and the
proof impressions with the drawing until no errors were found To those
who may read this voyage with a view to geographical information a
frequent reference to the Atlas is earnestly recommended for many
particulars are there marked which it would have been tedious to
describe and should any thing appear obscure in the narrative the charts
will generally afford an elucidation
From the general tenour of the explanations here given it will perhaps
be inferred that the perfection of the Atlas has been the principal
object of concern in fact having no pretension to authorship the
writing of the narrative though by much the most troublesome part of my
labour was not that upon which any hope of reputation was founded a
polished style was therefore not attempted but some pains have been
taken to render it clearly intelligible The first quire of my manuscript
was submitted to the judgment of a few literary friends and I hope to
have profited by the corrections they had the kindness to make but
finding these to bear more upon redundancies than inaccuracy of
expression I determined to confide in the indulgence of the public
endeavour to improve as the work advanced and give my friends no further
trouble Matter rather than manner was the object of my anxiety and if
the reader shall be satisfied with the selection and arrangement and not
think the information destitute of such interest as might be expected
from the subject the utmost of my hopes will be accomplished
NB Throughout this narrative the variation has been allowed upon the
bearings and also in the direction of winds tides etc the whole are
therefore to be considered with reference to the true poles of the earth
unless it be otherwise particularly expressed and perhaps in some few
cases of the ships head when variations are taken where the expression
by compass or magnetic may have been omitted
