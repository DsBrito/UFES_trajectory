and pushed his chair back from the table As he came to his feet
there was a soft bellnote from the table ComWeb He hesitated said
Go ahead
Is intrusion permitted the ComWeb inquired
Depends the guest said Whos calling
The name is Reetal Destone
He grinned appeared pleasantly surprised Put the lady through
There was a brief silence Then a womans voice inquired softly
Quillan
Right here doll Where
Seal the ComWeb Quillan
He reached down to the instrument tapped the seal button said All
right Were private
Probably the womans voice said But better scramble this too I
want to be very sure no ones listening
Quillan grunted slid his left hand into an inner coat pocket briefly
fingered a device of the approximate size and shape of a cigarette
drew his hand out again Scrambling he announced Now what
Mayday Quillan the soft voice said Can you come immediately
Quillans face went expressionless Of course Is it urgent
Im in no present danger But wed better waste no time
Is it going to take real hardware Im carrying a finger gun at the
moment
Then go to your rooms and pick up something useful Reetal said
This should take real hardware all right
All right Then where do I go
Ill meet you at your door I know where it is
When Quillan arrived she was standing before the door to his suite a
tall blonde in a sleeveless black and gold sheath a beautiful body a
warm lovely humorous face The warmth and humor were real but
masked a mind as impersonally efficient as a computer and a taste for
high and dangerous living When Quillan had last met Reetal Destone a
year and a half before the taste was being satisfied in industrial
espionage He hadnt heard of her activities since then
She smiled thoughtfully at him as he came up Ill wait outside she
said Were not talking here
Quillan nodded went on into his living room selected a gun belt and
holstered gun from a suitcase fastened the belt around his waist
under the coat and came out Now what
First a little portalhopping
He followed her across the corridor and into a tube portal watched as
she tapped out a setting The exit light flashed a moment later they
stepped out into a vacant lounge elsewhere in the same building
crossed it entered another portal After three more shifts they
emerged into a long hall dimly lit heavily carpeted There was no
one in sight
Last stop Reetal said She glanced up at his face Were on the
other side of the Star now in one of the sections theyve closed up
Ive established a kind of emergency headquarters here The Stars
nearly broke did you know
Id heard of it
That appears to be part of the reason for whats going on
Quillan said Whats going on
Reetal slid her arm through his said Come on Thats my hmmm
unregistered suite over there Big boy its very very selfish of me
but I was extremely glad to detect your name on the list of newly
arrived guests just now As to whats going on  the Camelot
berths here at midnight you know
Quillan nodded Ive some business with one of her passengers
Reetal bent to unlock the entrance door to the indicated suite The
way it looks now she remarked the odds are pretty high that youre
not going to keep that appointment
Why not
Because shortly after the Camelot docks and somethings been
unloaded from her the Camelot and the Seventh Star Hotel are
scheduled to go poof together Along with you me and some twelve
thousand other people And so far I havent been able to think of a
good way to keep it from happening
Quillan was silent a moment Whos scheduling the poof he asked
Some old acquaintances of ours are among them Come on in What
theyre doing comes under the heading of destroying the evidence
She locked the door behind them said Just a moment went over to
the paneled wall turned down a tiny silver switch Room portal she
said nodding at the wall It might come in handy I keep it turned
off most of the time
Why are you turning it on now Quillan asked
One of the Stars stewards is working on this with me Hell be along
as soon as he can get away Now Ill give you the whole thing as
briefly as I can The old acquaintances I mentioned are some boys of
the Brotherhood of Beldon Movaines here hes got Marras Cooms and
Fluel with him and around thirty of the Brotherhoods top guns Nome
Lancions coming in on the Camelot in person tonight to take charge
Obviously with all that brass on the job theyre after something
very big Just what it is I dont yet know Ive got one clue but a
rather puzzling one Tell you about that later Do you know Velladon
The commodore here Quillan nodded Ive never met him but I know
who he is
Reetal said Hes been manager of the Seventh Star Hotel for the past
nine years Hes involved in the Beldon outfits operation So is the
chief of the Stars private security forcehis names Ryterand half
a dozen other Star executives Theyve got plenty of firepower too
close to half the entire security force I understand including all
the officers That would come to nearly seventy men Theres reason to
believe the rest of the force was disarmed and murdered by them in the
subspace section of the Star about twelve hours ago They havent been
seen since then
Now Velladon aside from his share in whatever theyre after has
another reason for wanting to wipe out the Star in an unexplained
blowup There I have definite information Did you know the Mooley
brothers owned the Star
Yes
Ive been working for the Mooleys the past eight months Reetal
said checking up on employees at Velladons level for indications of
graft And it appears the commodore had been robbing them blind here
for at least several years
Sort of risky thing to try with the Mooleys from what I hear
Quillan remarked
Yes Very Velladon had reason to be getting a little desperate about
that Two men were planted here a month ago One of them is Sher
Heraga the steward I told you about The other man came in as a
bookkeeper Two weeks ago Heraga got word out that the bookkeeper had
disappeared Velladon and Ryter apparently got wise to what he was
trying to do So the Mooleys sent me here to find out exactly what was
going on before they took action I arrived four days ago
She gave a regretful little headshake I waited almost a day before
contacting Heraga It seemed advisable to move very cautiously in the
matter But that made it a little too late to do anything Quillan
for the past three days the Seventh Star Hotel has been locked up
like a bank vault And except for ourselves only the people who are
in on the plot are aware of it
The message transmitters are inoperative he asked
Reetal nodded The story is that a gravitic storm center in the area
has disrupted transmissions completely for the time being
What about incoming ships
Yours was the only one scheduled before the Camelot arrives It
left again eight hours ago Nobody here had been let on board The
guests who wanted to apply for outgoing berths were told there were
none open that theyd have to wait for the Camelot
She went over to a desk unlocked a drawer took out a sheaf of
papers and handed one of them to Quillan Thats the layout of the
Star she said This fivelevel building over by the shell is the
Executive Block The Brotherhood and the commodores men moved in
there this morning The Block is the Stars defense center Its
raidproofed contains the control officers and the transmitter and
armament rooms About the standard arrangement While they hold the
Executive Block they have absolute control of the Star
If its the defense center it should be practically impossible to do
anything about them there Quillan agreed They could close it up
and dump the air out of the rest of the Star in a minute if they had
to But there must be  well what about the lifeboats in the
subspace sectionand our pals must have a getaway ship stashed away
somewhere
They have two ships Reetal said A soupedup armed freighter the
Brotherhood came in on and a large armed yacht which seems to be the
commodores personal property Unfortunately theyre both in subspace
locks
Why unfortunately
Because theyve sealed off subspace Try portaling down there and
youll find yourself looking at a battleplastic bulkhead Theres no
way of getting either to those ships or to the lifeboats
Quillan lifted his eyebrows And that hasnt caused any comment
What about the maintenance crews the warehouse men the
All the work crews were hauled out of subspace this morning Reetal
said On the quiet the Stars employees have been told that a gang
of raiders was spotted in the warehouse area and is at present
cornered there Naturally the matter isnt to be mentioned to the
guests to avoid arousing unnecessary concern And that explains
everything very neatly The absence of the security men and why
subspace is sealed off Why the Executive Block is under guard and
cant be enteredand why the technical and office personnel in there
dont come out and dont communicate out Theyve been put on
emergency status officially
Yunk Quillan said disgustedly after a moment This begins to look
like a hopeless situation doll
True
Lets see now
Reetal interrupted There is one portal still open to subspace
Thats in the Executive Block of course and Heraga reports its
heavily guarded
How does he know
The Blocks getting its meals from Phalagon House He floated a diner
in there a few hours ago
Well Quillan said brightening perhaps a deft flavoring of
poison
Reetal shook her head I checked over the hospital stocks Not a
thing there that wouldnt be spotted at once Unless we can clobber
them thoroughly we cant afford to make them suspicious with a trick
like that
Poison would be a bit rough on the office help too Quillan
conceded They wouldnt be in on the deal
No theyre not Theyre working under guard
Gas  no I suppose not It would take too long to whip up
something that could turn the trick Quillan glanced at his watch
If the Camelot docks at midnight weve around six and a half hours
left doll And I dont find myself coming up with any brilliant
ideas What have you thought of
Reetal hesitated a moment Nothing very brilliant either she said
then But there are two things we might try as a last resort
Lets hear them
I know a number of people registered in the Star at present whod be
carrying personal weapons If they were told the facts I could
probably line up around twenty whod be willing to make a try to get
into the Executive Block and take over either the control offices or
the transmitter room If we got a warning out to the Camelot that
would break up the plot Of course it wouldnt necessarily save the
Star
No Quillan said but its worth trying if we cant think of
something better How would you get them inside
We could crowd twenty men into one of those diner trucks and Heraga
could take us in
What kind of people are your pals
A few smugglers and confidence men Ive had connections with Fairly
good boys for this sort of thing Then theres an old millionaire
sportsman with a party of six waiting to transfer to the Camelot
for a safari on Jontarou Old Philmarron isnt all there in my
opinion but hes dead game and loves any kind of a ruckus We can
count on him and his friends if theyre not too drunk at the moment
Still  thats not too many to set against something less than a
hundred professional guns even though some of them must be down on
the two ships
No not enough Quillan looked thoughtful Whats the other idea
Let the cat out of the bag generally Tell the guests and the
employees out here whats going on and see if somebody can think of
something that might be done
He shook his head What youd set off with that would be anywhere
between a riot and a panic The boys in the Executive Block would
simply give us the breathless treatment Apparently they prefer to
have everything looking quiet and normal when the Camelot gets
here
But they dont have to play it that way Reetal agreed We might be
dead for hours before the liner docks If they keep the landing lock
closed until what they want has been unloaded nobody on the Camelot
would realize what had happened before it was too late
There was a moments silence Then Quillan said You mentioned youd
picked up a clue to what theyre after What was that
Well thats a curious thing Reetal said On the trip out here a
young girl name of Solvey Kinmarten attached herself to me She didnt
want to talk much but I gathered she was newly married and that her
husband was on board and was neglecting her Shes an appealing little
thing and she seemed so forlorn and upset that I adopted her for the
rest of the run After we arrived of course I pretty well forgot
about the Kinmartens and their troubles
A few hours ago Solvey suddenly came bursting into the suite where
Im registered She was shaking all over After I calmed her down a
bit she spilled out her story She and her husband Brock Kinmarten
are rest wardens With another man named Eltak whom Solvey describes
as some sort of crazy old coot theyre assigned to escort two
deluxe private rest cubicles to a very exclusive sanatorium on
Mezmiali But Brock told Solvey at the beginning of the trip that this
was a very unusual assignment that he didnt want her even to come
near the cubicles That wouldnt have bothered her so much she says
but on the way here Brock became increasingly irritable and
absentminded She knew he was worrying about the cubicles and she
began to wonder whether they werent involved in something illegal
The pay was very high theyre both getting almost twice the regular
warden fee for the job One day she found an opportunity to do a
little investigating
The cubicles are registered respectively to a Lady Pendrake and a
Major Pendrake Lady Pendrake appears to be genuine the cubicle is
unusually large and constructed somewhat differently from the ones
with which Solvey was familiar but it was clear that it had an
occupant However the life indicator on Major Pendrakes cubicle
registered zero when she switched it on If there was something inside
it it wasnt a living human being
That was all she learned at the time because she was afraid Brock
might catch her in the cubicle room Here in the Star the cubicles
were taken to a suite reserved for Lady Pendrake The other man
Eltak stayed in the suite with the cubicles while the Kinmartens
were given other quarters However Brock was still acting oddly and
spending most of his time in the Pendrake suite So this morning
Solvey swiped his key to the suite and slipped in when she knew the
two men had left it
Illustration
Shed barely got there when she heard Brock and Eltak at the door
again She ran into the next room and hid in a closet Suddenly there
was a commotion in the front room and Solvey realized that men from
the Stars security force had arrived and were arresting Brock and
Eltak They hauled both of them away then floated the cubicles out
and on a carrier and took them off too locking the suite behind them
Solvey was in a complete panic sure that she and Brock had become
involved in some serious breach of the Warden Code She waited a few
minutes then slipped out of the Pendrake suite and looked me up to
see if I couldnt help them I had Heraga check and he reported that
the Kinmarten suite was under observation Evidently they wanted to
pick up the girl too So I tucked her away in one of the suites in
this section and gave her something to put her to sleep Shes there
now
Quillan said And where are the prisoners and the cubicles
In the Executive Block
How do you know
Reetal smiled briefly The Duke of Fluel told me
Huh The Brotherhood knows youre here
Relax Reetal said Nobody but Heraga knows Im working for the
Mooleys I told the Duke I had a big con deal set up when the
Camelot came inI even suggested he might like to get in on it He
laughed and said he had other plans But he wont mention to anyone
that Im here
Why not
Because Reetal said dryly what the Duke is planning to get in on
is an hour of tender dalliance Before the Camelot arrives
necessarily The coldblooded little skunk She hesitated a moment
when she spoke again her voice had turned harsh and nasal wicked
amusement sounding through it Sort of busy at the moment
sweetheart but we might find time for a drink or two later on in the
evening eh
Quillan grunted Youre as good at the voice imitations as ever How
did you find out about the cubicles
I took a chance and fed him a Moment of Truth
With Fluel Quillan said thoughtfully that was taking a chance
Believe me I was aware of it Ive run into cardcarrying sadists
before but the Dukes the only one who scares me silly But it did
work He dropped in for a about a minute and a half and came out
without noticing a thing Meanwhile Id got the answers to a few
questions The bomb with which theyre planning to mop up behind them
already has been planted up here in the normspace section Fluel
didnt know where armaments experts took care of it Its armed now
Theres a firing switch on each of their ships and both switches have
to be tripped before the thing goes off Part of what theyre after is
in those Pendrake rest cubicles
Part of it Quillan asked
Uhhuh An even hundred similar cubicles will be unloaded from the
Camelotthe bulk of the haul which is why Nome Lancion is
supervising things on the liner I started to ask what was in the
cubicles but I saw Fluel was beginning to lose that blank look they
have under Truth and switched back to light chitchat just before he
woke up Yacos paying for the jobor rather it will pay for the
stuff on delivery and no questions asked
Thats not very much help is it Quillan said after a moment
Something a big crooked industrial combine like Yaco thinks it can
use
It must expect to be able to use it to extremely good advantage
Reetal said The Brotherhood will collect thirty million credits for
their part of the operation The commodores group presumably wont do
any worse She glanced past Quillan toward the room portal Its
OK Heraga Come in
Sher Heraga was a lean darkskinned little man with a badly bent
nose black curly hair and a nervous look He regretted he said
that he hadnt been able to uncover anything which might be a lead to
the location of the bomb Apparently it wasnt even being guarded
And of course a bomb of the size required here would be quite easy
to conceal
If they havent placed guards over it Reetal agreed itll take
blind luck to spot it Unless we can get hold of one of the men who
knows where its planted
There was silence for some seconds Then Quillan said Well if we
cant work out a good plan wed better see what we can do with one of
the bad ones Are the commodores security men wearing uniforms
Heraga shook his head Not the ones I saw
Then heres an idea Quillan said As things stand barging into
the Executive Block with a small armed group cant accomplish much It
might be more interesting than sitting around and waiting to be blown
up but it still would be suicide However if we could get things
softened up and disorganized in there first
Softened up and disorganized how Reetal asked
We can use that notion you had of having Heraga float in another
diner This time Im on boardin a stewards uniform in case the
guards check
They didnt the first time Heraga said
Sloppy of them Well theyre just gun hands Anyway once were
inside I shuck off the uniform and get out Heraga delivers his
goodies and leaves again
Reetal gave him a look Youll get shot down the instant youre seen
dope
I think not Therere two groups in therearound a hundred men in
alland they havent had time to get well acquainted yet Ill have
my gun in sight and anyone who sees me should figure I belong to the
other group until I run into one of the Brotherhood boys who knows me
personally
Then thats when you get shot down I understand the last time you
and the Duke of Fluel met he woke up with lumps
The Duke doesnt love me Quillan admitted But theres nothing
personal between me and Movaine or Marras Coomsand Ill have a
message for Movaine
What kind of a message
Ill have to play that by ear a little It depends on how things
look in there But I have a few ideas based on what youve learned of
the operation Now just what I can do when I get that far I dont
know yet Ill simply try to louse the deal up as much as I can That
may take time and of course it might turn out to be impossible to
get word out to you
So what do we do meanwhile Reetal asked If we start lining up our
attack group immediately and then theres no action for another five
or six hours theres always the chance of a leak with around twenty
people in the know
And if theres a leak Quillan agreed weve probably had it No
youd better wait with that If Im not out and you havent heard
from me before the Camelots actually due to dock Heraga can still
take the groupeveryone but yourselfin as scheduled
Why everyone but me Reetal asked
If nothing else works you might find some way of getting a warning
to the liners security force after theyve docked It isnt much of a
possibility but we cant afford to throw it away
Yes I see Reetal looked reflective What do you think Heraga
The little man shrugged You told me that Mr Quillan is not
inexperienced in dealing with ah his enemies If he feels he might
accomplish something in the Executive Block Im in favor of the plan
The situation certainly could hardly become worse
Thats the spirit Quillan approved The positive outlookthats
what a think like this mainly takes Can you arrange for the diner and
the uniform
Oh yes Heraga said Ive had myself put in charge of that detail
naturally
Then what can you tell me about the Executive Blocks layout
Reetal stood up Come over to the desk she said Weve got
diagrams
The five levels as you see Heraga was explaining a few moments
later are built directly into the curve of the Stars shells Level
Five on the top is therefore quite small The other levels are
fairly extensive Two Three and Four could each accommodate a
hundred men comfortably These levels contain mainly living quarters
private offices and the like The Brotherhood men appear to be
occupying the fourth level Velladons group the second The third may
be reserved for meetings between representatives of the two groups
All three of these levels are connected by singleexit portals to the
large entrance area on the ground level
The portals stood open when I went in earlier today and there were
about twenty armed men lounging about the entrance hall I recognized
approximately half of them as being members of the Stars security
force The others were unfamiliar Heraga cleared his throat There
is a possibility that the two groups do not entirely trust each
other
Quillan nodded If theyre playing around with something like sixty
million CR anybody would have to be crazy to trust the Brotherhood of
Beldon The transmitter room and the control officers are guarded
too
Yes but not heavily Heraga said There seem to be only a few men
stationed at each of those points Ostensibly theyre there as a
safeguardin case the imaginary raiders attempt to break out of the
subspace section
Whats the arrangement of the ordinary walkin tube portals in the
Executive Block
There is one which interconnects the five levels On each of the
lower levels there are in addition several portals which lead out
to various points in the Seventh Star Hotel On the fifth level there
is only one portal of this kind Except for the portal which operates
between the different levels in the Executive Block all of them have
been rendered unusable at present
Unusable in what way
They have been sealed off on the Executive Block side
Can you get me a diagram of the entry and exit systems those outgoing
portals connect with Quillan asked I might turn one of them usable
again
Yes I can do that
How about the communication possibilities
The ComWeb system is functioning normally on the second third and
fourth levels It has been shut off on the first levelto avoid the
spread of alarming rumors by office personnel There is no ComWeb on
the fifth level
Reetal said Well shift our operating headquarters back to my
registered suite then The ComWebs are turned off in these vacant
sections Ill stay in the other suite in case you find a chance to
signal in
Heraga left a few minutes later to make his arrangements Reetal
smiled at Quillan a little dubiously
Good luck guy she said Anything else to settle before you start
off
Quillan nodded Couple of details If youre going to be in your
regular suite and Fluel finds himself with some idle time on hand he
might show up for the dalliance you mentioned
Reetals smile changed slightly Her left hand fluffed the hair at the
back of her head flicked down again There was a tiny click and
Quillan looked at a small jeweled hairclasp in her palm its needle
beak pointing at him
It hasnt got much range Reetal said but within ten feet it will
scramble the Dukes brains just as thoroughly as they need to be
scrambled
Good enough Quillan said Just dont give that boy the ghost of a
chance doll He has a rep for playing very unnice games with the
ladies
I know his reputation Reetal replaced the tiny gun in her hair
Anything else
Yes Lets look in on the Kinmarten chick for a moment If shes
awake she may have remembered something or other by now that she
didnt think to tell you
They found Solvey Kinmarten awake and tearfully glad to see Reetal
Quillan was introduced as a member of the legal profession who would
do what he could for Solvey and her husband Solvey frowned prettily
trying very hard to remember anything that might be of use But it
appeared that she had told Reetal all she knew
The blue and white Phalagon House diner driven by Heraga was
admitted without comment into the Executive Block It floated on
unchallenged through the big entry hall and into a corridor
Immediately behind the first turn of the corridor the diner paused a
few seconds Its side door opened and closed The diner moved on
Quillan coatless and with the wellworn butt of a big Miam Devil
Special protruding from the holster on his right hip came briskly
back along the corridor Between fifteen and twenty men their guns
also conspicuously in evidence were scattered about the entrance
hall expressions and attitudes indicating a curious mixture of
boredom and uneasy tension The eyes of about half of them swiveled
around to Quillan when he came into the hall then with one
exception they looked indifferently away again
The exception leaning against the wall near the three open portals to
the upper levels continued to stare as Quillan came toward him
forehead creased in a deep scowl as if he were painfully ransacking
his mind for something Quillan stopped in front of him
Chum he asked any idea where Movaine is at the moment They just
give me this message for him
Still scowling the other scratched his chin and blinked Uh
dunno for sure he said after a moment He oughta be in the third
level conference room with the rest of em Uh  dunno you oughta
barge in there right now pal The commodores reeelly hot about
somethin
Quillan looked worried Gotta chance it I guess Message is pretty
important they say He turned went through the center portal of
the three abruptly found himself walking along a wide welllit hall
Nobody in sight here or in the first intersecting passage he came to
When he reached the next passage he heard voices on the right turned
toward them went by a string of closed doors on both sides until
forty feet on the passage angled again and opened into a long
