of Colonel John Nicolay to Major Hay dated August 25 1864 in which
the following opening paragraph is found
Hell is to pay The New York politicians have got a stampede on
that is about to swamp everything Raymond and the National
Committee are here today R thinks a Commission to Richmond is
about the only salt to save us while the President sees and says
it would be utter ruination The matter is now undergoing
consultation Weakkneed damned fools are in the movement for a new
candidate to supplant the President Everything is darkness doubt
and discouragement
No liberty has been taken with an essential detail of history in the
development of the action except to slightly shift the dates of two
incidents for dramatic unity In neither case does the change of date
affect the validity of the scene as used

SET SCENE The roughhewn log cabin of Tom Lincoln is seen in the
center surrounded by the forest wilderness of Southern Indiana 1820
The cabin door is cut in level with the ground There is no shutter to
the door and no window to the cabin
Right and Left of the door opening are rude benches of split logs On
the walls are stretched a coon and a small bear squirrel and muskrat
skins In the foreground on the right is seen an oldfashioned wash pot
set on three stones Near the wash pot is fixed in the ground a pole
on the top of which are hung six gourds cut for martin swallows to nest
in Beside it are a rude bench and two wash tubs On the left is a
crude settee made of a split log with legs set in augur holes and a
rough back made of saplings An oldfashioned doctors saddlebags hang
across the back of the settee The trees are walnut beech and
oakundergrowth of dogwood sumac and wild grapevines These vines
festooned over the cabin give a sinister impression A creek winds
down through the hills behind the cabin

pauses listens and slowly peeps inside She listens again and then
slips away and calls

NANCY enters by door of cabin
NANCYS sudden appearance in the door swings ABE around with a
quick cry of pain The sun is tinging the eastern sky with the
splendor of an Indian Summer morning The mothers figure in blue
homespun suggests against the dark background of the cabin door the
coming of a spirit from the unseen world She pauses a moment in
the doorway and smiles at her son

legislature
TOM enters from the cabin with the rock and Bible he crosses to

picks up her hand and the chill of it worries him
ABE and SARAH rise
NANCY

ABE
Brightly

NANCY
The Twentythird Psalm
ABE looks for the place
I love to hear you read my boy It means that you can do what any

ABE
Reads
The Lord is my shepherdI shall not want He maketh me to lie down in
green pastures He leadeth me beside still waters He restoreth my
soul He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his names
sake
NANCY
In a whisper
Yea tho I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear
no evil for thou art with me
ABE stops looks up at his mother in amazement
ABE
Ma
NANCY
Remember always my boy that God is with you He is in the day
and the night He is in the sun and the wind the trees and the
grassand not a sparrow falls to the ground without He knows You
recollect the year you put up those gourds there
She points to the pole
for your martins You cried when they circled away in the fall
ABE nods
I told you God would send them back in the spring didnt I
She laughs softly
You said that Hed forget to tell them and theyd never find the
waybut they camedidnt they
ABE
Yes Ma and I know now theyll come again next spring
NANCY
SoI want you never again to doubt God my boy and I want you never
to doubt yourself Your bare feet your ragged clothes how poor you
arethis is nothing It doesnt count hereits what you feel its
what you believeits what you see that counts Ive taught you to
read and write and now you can do anything If God takes me
She pauses exhausted
ABE

had grown a manstrong and bravewise and gentle The people hung on
your words and did you homage But you remembered this cabin here in
the deep woods and you were humble I walked with you between two white
pillars It was still and solemn in there Outside I could hear the
people calling your name You bowed low and whispered in my ear This
is all yours my Mother I bought it for you with my life All that I
am I owe to you
Her voice sinks to a whisper that is half a laugh of religious
ecstasy
ABE
Joyfully
See how shes smilinPa Shes getting wellI tell you

ABE springs to his feet and stares in anguish as TOM falls on
his knees beside NANCY NANCYS hand rests gently on TOMS
shaggy head while he sobs With her other hand she feels for
ABES and holds it feebly
NANCY
Be good to your Father
She pauses and breathes with difficulty
In the days to come he will be the child and you the man
ABE
Yes
NANCY
And love your sister
ABE nods
If dark hours come my spirit will be watching my sonand Ill help
you if I can
ABE
Yes I know it
NANCY

only sayI will
NANCYS body sinks in death as the boy lifts his face illumined
by the light of a great purpose
ABE
Yes MaI will
