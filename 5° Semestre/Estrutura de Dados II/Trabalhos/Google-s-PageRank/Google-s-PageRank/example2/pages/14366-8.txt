ARGENTINA FROM A BRITISH POINT OF VIEW
Argentina which does not profess to be a manufacturing country
exported in 1909 material grown on her own lands to the value of
79000000 and imported goods to the extent of 60000000 This fact
arrests our attention and forces us to recognise that there is a trade
balance of nearly 20 millions sterling in her favour and to realise the
saving power of the country
It is not mere curiosity which prompts us to ask Are these 79000000
worth of exports of any value to us Do we consume any of them Do we
manufacture any of them And do we send any of this same stuff back
again after it has been dealt with by our British artisans It would be
difficult to follow definitely any one article but upon broad lines the
questions are simple and can be easily answered Amongst the
agricultural exports we find wheat oats maize linseed and flour The
value placed upon these in 1908 amounted to 48000000 and England
pays for and consumes nearly 42 per cent of these exports Other goods
such as frozen beef chilled beef mutton pork wool and articles
which may be justly grouped as the results of the cattle and sheep
industry amounted to no less a figure than 23000000 All these
exports represent foodstuffs or other necessities of life and are
consumed by those nations which do not produce enough from their own
soil to keep their teeming populations Another export which is worthy
of particular mention comes from the forests viz quebracho which in
the form of logs and extract was exported in 1908 to the value of
1200000 The value of material of all sorts sent from England to
Argentina in 1908 was 16938872 this figure includes such things as
manufactured woollen goods leather goods oils and paints therefore
it is clear that we have and must continue to take a practical and
financial interest in the welfare and prosperity of Argentina
New countries cannot get on without men willing and ready to exploit
Natures gifts and naturally we look to the immigration returns when
considering Argentinas progress To give each years return for the
last 50 years would be wearisome but taking the average figures for
tenyear periods from 1860 to 1909 we have the following interesting
table The figures represent the balance of those left in the country
after allowing for emigration
Yearly Average
From 1860 to 1869 inclusive     15044
1870   1879                29462
1880   1889                84586

Sixtyfive per cent of the immigrants are agricultural labourers who
soon find work in the country and again add their quota to the
increasing quantity and value of materials to be exported Facing this
page is a diagram of the Immigration Returns from 1857 to 1909
Nature has been lavish in her gifts to Argentina and man has taken
great advantage of these gifts My desire now is to show what has been
done in the way of developing agriculture in this richlyendowed country
during the last fifty years One name which should never be forgotten in
Argentina is that of William Wheelwright whose entrance into active
life in Buenos Aires was not particularly dignified in 1826 he was
shipwrecked at the mouth of the River Plate and struggled on
barefooted hatless and starving to the small town of Quilmes
Illustration DIAGRAM OF IMMIGRATION RETURNS
NOTEIN THE YEARS 1888 1889  1890 THE ARGENTINE GOVERNMENT ASSISTED
PASSAGES
Mr Wheelwright was an earnest and farseeing man and his knowledge of
railways in the United States helped him to realise their great
possibilities in Argentina but strange to say upon his return to his
native land he could not impress any of those men who afterwards became
such great Railway Kings in the USA Failing to obtain capital for
Argentine railway development in his own country Wheelwright came to
England and interested Thomas Brassey whose name was then a household
word amongst railway pioneers These two men associated themselves with
Messrs Ogilvie  Wythes forming themselves into the firm of Brassey
Ogilvie Wythes  Wheelwright whose first work was the building of a
railway 17480 kilometres long between Buenos Aires and Quilmes in 1863
afterwards they built the line from Rosario to Cordova which is
embodied today in the Central Argentine Railway Other railways were
projected and this policy of progress and extension of the steel road
still holds good in Argentina
The year 1857 saw the first railway built from Buenos Ayres to Flores
5879 kilometres long in 1870 there were 457 miles of railroad in 1880
the railways had increased their mileage to 1572 in 1890 Argentina
possessed 5895 miles of railway and in 1900 there were 10352 miles
The rapid increase in railway mileage during the last nine years is as
follows
In 1901 there were 10565 miles of railway
1902          10868
1903          11500
1904          12140
1905          12370
1906          12850
1907          13829
1908          14825
1909          15937A
12000 of which are owned by English companies representing a capital
investment of 170000000
In other words for the last forty years Argentina has built railways
at the rate of over a mile a day and in 1907 1908 and 1909 her
average rate per day was nearly three miles This means that owing to
the extension of railways during this last year alone over a million
more acres of land could have been given up to the plough if suitable
for the cultivation of corn
When William Wheelwright first visited Argentina it was little more than
an unknown land whose inhabitants had no ambition and no desire to
acquire wealthexcept at the expense of broken heads There was a
standard of wealth but it lay in the number of cattle owned land was
of little value save for feeding cattle and therefore counted for
naught but cattle could be boiled down for tallow bones and hides were
also marketable commodities the man therefore who possessed cattle
possessed wealth
The opening out of the country by railways soon changed the aspect of
affairs The man who possessed cattle was no longer considered the rich
man it was he who owned leagues of land upon which wheat could be grown
who became the potentially rich man he by cutting up his land and
renting it to the immigrants who were beginning to flock in in an
endless stream to the country found that riches were being accumulated
for him without much exertion on his part He took a risk inasmuch as he
received payment in kind only Therefore when the immigrants did well
so did he and as many thousands of immigrants have become rich it
follows that the land proprietors have become immensely so It was the
railways which created this possibility and endowed the country by
rendering it practicable to grow corn where cattle only existed before
but many Argentines today forget what they owe to the railway pioneers
it is the railways and the railways only which render the splendid and
yearly increasing exports possible
In 1858 cattle formed 25 per cent of the total wealth of Argentina but
in 1885 cattle only represented 18 per cent of the total wealth
railways having made it possible during those thirty years to utilise
lands for other purposes than cattlefeeding Let it be clearly
understood the total value of cattle had not decreased far from that
the cattle had increased in value during the above period to the extent
of 48000000 and today cattle sheep horses mules pigs goats and
asses represent a value of nearly 130000000 The following table
shows how great the improvement has been in Argentine animals
Per Head
Cattle in 1885 were valued at an average of  13B
1908                             32
Sheep  in 1885                              2
1908                              4
Horses in 1885                             11
1908                             25
Notwithstanding these increased valuations per head and the larger
number of animals in the country the value created by mans labour far
outweighs the increased value of mere breeding animals
Next to the railways the improvements in shipping have helped the
development of Argentina the shipping trade of Buenos Aires has
increased at the rate of one million tons per annum for the past few
years and the entries into the port form an interesting and instructive
table
The following statement gives the total tonnage that passed through the
port of Buenos Aires from 1880 to 1909 and will more clearly show the
increase and advance made in the last thirty years These figures
include both steamers and sailingvessels and local as well as foreign
trade

In 1897 out of the total number of steamers that entered Buenos Aires
viz 901 with a tonnage of 2342391 519 with a tonnage of
1327571 were British Taking the year 1909 we find that 2008
steamers and 137 sailingvessels entered the port of Buenos Aires from
foreign shores with a tonnage of 5193542 and 1978 steamers and 129
sailingvessels left the port for foreign shores with a tonnage of
5174114 out of these British boats lead with 2242 steamers and 37
sailingvessels or say 5312 per cent of the total Germany comes
next with 456 steamers and 2 sailingvessels or say 1034 per cent of
the total Italy with 307 steamers and 67 sailingvessels is next and
then France with 264 steamers The total number of steamers that entered
and left the port from local and foreign ports is 13485 with a tonnage
of 14481526 and 20264 sailingvessels with 2512447 tons which
make up the amount of 16993973 tons as shown above
In the year 1884 the experiment of freezing beef killed in Buenos
Aires and shipping it to Europe was first tried That was successful
but an immense improvement was made when the process of chilling became
the common means by which meat could be exported The frozen beef trade
in Argentina has had a wonderful development it commenced in 1884 and
the export of chilled meat has progressed steadily at the rate of 25000
beeves yearly until in 1908 it reached the enormous quantity of
573946 beeves or 180000 tons Frozen mutton has remained
comparatively steady and has only increased by 38000 tons in
twentytwo years or from 2000000 sheep frozen in 1886 to 3297667 in
1908 whilst jerked beef which was mostly sent to Cuba and Brazil
has fallen from 50000 tons per annum to 6651 tons The value of frozen
and preserved meats exported in 1908 was 5233948
The value of livestock in Argentina in 1908 was made up as follows
Cattle     82000000
Sheep       25000000
Horses      18000000
Mules        2000000
Pigs         1368000
Goats and Asses    1000000
A few years ago it was common on an estancia feeding 50000 or 60000
cattle to find the household using canned Swiss milk Today 425000
litres of milk are brought into the city of Buenos Aires each day for
consumption and no less than two tons of butter one ton of cream and
three tons of cheese are used there daily Argentina also exports
butter This trade has sprung up entirely within the last fourteen
years and in 1908 she exported 3549 tons of butter the value of which
was 283973
Until 1876 Argentina imported wheat for home consumption in that year
when for many years past agricultural labourers had been arriving at an
average of 25000 per annum she began to export wheat with a modest
shipment of 5000 tons Thirty years later the export had mounted up to
2247988 tons and in 1908 the wheat exported amounted to 3636293
tons and was valued at 25768520 Agricultural colonies had sprung up
everywhere and cattle became of secondrate importance today the
value of the exports of corn which term includes wheat barley maize
oats etc is more than double that of cattle and cattle products It
is interesting to follow the evolution wrought by labour intelligence
and capital in the prairie lands of Argentina First let us note the
developments on those wonderful tracts of splendid prairie lands lying
between the River Plate and the Andes fifty years ago these lands were
of little account and only a few cattle were to be found roaming about
them but upon the advance of the railway they came under the plough
and without much attention or care produced wheat and maize After a
time improvements in the method of cultivation produced a better return
and today a great deal of attention is paid to the preparing of the
land and thought and care are given to the seed time the growing and
the harvest When it is found desirable to rest the land after crops of
wheat and maize etc alfalfa is grown thereon Alfalfa is one of the
clover tribe and has the peculiar property of attaching to itself those
microorganisms which are able to fix the nitrogen in the air and render
it available for plant food Every colonist knows the value of alfalfa
for feeding his animals but it is not every colonist who knows why this
plant occupies such a high place amongst feeding stuffs Alfalfa is
easily grown very strong when established and provided its roots can
get to water will go on growing for years The raison detre for
growing alfalfa is for the feeding of cattle and preparing them for
market and for this purpose a league of alfalfa 6177 acres metric
measurement will carry on an average 3500 head When grown for dry
fodder it produces three or four crops per annum and a fair yield is
from 6 to 8 tons per acre of dry alfalfa for each year A ton of such
hay is worth about 20 to 30 and after deducting expenses there is a
clear return of about 14 per acre
The figures supplied by one large company are interesting they show
that on an average cattle when placed upon alfalfa lands improve in
value at the rate of 200 per head per month so it is easy to place a
value on its feeding properties Thus we will take a camp under alfalfa
capable of carrying 10000 head of cattle all the year round where as
the fattened animals are sold off an equal number is bought to replace
them Such a camp would bring in a clear profit of 200000 per annum
and the property should be worth 175000 sterling An animal that has
been kept all its life on rough camp and when too old for breeding is
placed for the first time on alfalfa lands fattens extremely quickly
and the meat is tender and in quality compares favourably with any other
beef No business in Argentina of the same importance has shown such
good returns as cattle breeding and these results have been chiefly
brought about by the introduction of alfalfa and a knowledge of the
life history of alfalfa is of the greatest importance to the cattle
farmer All cereal crops take from the soil mineral matter and nitrogen
Therefore after continuous cropping the land becomes exhausted and
generally poorer experience has taught us that rotation of crops is a
necessity to alleviate the strain on the soil and such an axiom has
this become that in many cases English landlords insist that their
leases shall contain a clause binding the tenants to grow certain stated
crops in rotation
This system is known in England as the fourcourse shift Knowledge
gained by successive generations of observant farmers has given us the
key to what Nature had hitherto kept to herself and today we know why
the plan adopted by our forefathers was right and why the rotation of
crops was and is a necessity Men of science are devoting their lives
to the systematic study of Natures hidden secrets and by means of
Agricultural Colleges as well as private individual research these
discoveries are being given to mankind and long before the soils of
Argentina show any serious loss of nitrogen from continuous cropping
science will probably have established means of applying in a practical
manner those methods already known of propagating the
nitrogencollecting bacteria which thrive on alfalfa clover peas soya
beans and other leguminous plants Almost every country is now devoting
time money and energy to agricultural research work In 1908 the
Agricultural College at Ontario prepared no less than 474 packages of
Legume Bacteria and in 309 cases beneficial results followed from the
application thereof to the soil in 165 cases no improvements in the
crops were noticed this may however have been due to the want of
knowledge of how to manipulate the bacteria or to lack of experience in
noting effects scientifically but in any case the experiment must be
considered successful when the results obtained were satisfactory in no
less than 65 per cent of the trials No greater factor exists than the
microscope in opening up and hunting out the secrets concealed in the
very soil we are standing on
If soils were composed of nothing but pure silica sand nothing would
ever grow but in Nature we find that soils contain all sorts of mineral
matter and chief amongst these is lime
Alfalfa thrives on land which contains lime and gives but poor results
where this ingredient is deficient The explanation is simple There is
a community of interest between the very low microscopic animal life
known as bacteria and plant life generally In every ounce of soil
there are millions of these living germs which have their allotted work
to do and they thrive best in soils containing lime
If one digs up with great care a root of alfalfa it need not be an old
plant the youngest plant will show the same peculiarity and care is
taken in exposing the root perhaps the best method is the washing away
of the surrounding earth by water some small nodules attached to the
fine hairlike roots are easily distinguished by the naked eye and
these nodules are the home of a teeming microscopical industrious
population who perform their allotted work with the silent persistent
energy so often displayed in Nature Men of science have been able to
identify at least three classes of these bacteria and to ascertain the
work accomplished by each The reason for their existence would seem to
be that one class is able to convert the nitrogen in the air into
ammonia whilst others work it into nitrite and the third class so
manipulate it as to form a nitrate which is capable of being used for
plant food
Now although one ton of alfalfa removes from the soil 50 lb of
nitrogen yet that crop leaves the soil richer in nitrogen because the
alfalfa has encouraged the multiplication of those factories which
convert some of the thousands of tons of nitrogen floating above the
earth into substance suitable for food for plant life As a dry fodder
for cattle three tons of alfalfa contains as much nutrition as two tons
of wheat
The cost of growing alfalfa greatly depends upon the situation of the
land to be dealt with also upon whether labour is plentiful or not
but in order to give some idea of the advantage of growing this cattle
food we will imagine the intrinsic value of the undeveloped land to be
4000 upon which under existing conditions it would be possible to
keep 1000 head of animals whereas if this same land were under alfalfa
3000 to 3500 animals would be fattened thereon and the land would
have increased in value to 20000 or 30000
Now if the undeveloped land is to be improved it becomes necessary
either to work it yourself with your own men in which case you must
provide ploughs horses bullocks etc or to carry out the plan
usually adopted that of letting the land to colonists who have had some
experience in this class of work Usually a colonist will undertake to
cultivate from 500 to 600 acres and agrees to pay to the landowner
anything from 10 per cent to 30 per cent of his crops according to the
distance of the land from the railway The colonist brings his
agricultural tackle along with him and establishes his house usually a
most primitive affair digs his well and then proceeds to plough In
this work the whole family joins the father leads the way followed by
the eldest child and all the others in rotation with the wife bringing
up the rear she keeps a maternal eye upon the little mite who with
great gusto and terrific yells manages somehow to cling to the plough
and to do his or her share with the rest Is it to be wondered at that
work progresses fast under these conditions There is but one idea
prevalent in the family namely that time and opportunity are with
them
The first crop grown on newlybroken ground is usually maize the second
years crop is linseed and perhaps a third years cropprobably
wheatis grown by the colonist before the land is handed back to the
owner ready to be put down in alfalfa The colonists cultivation of the
land will have effectually killed off the natural rough grasses which
would otherwise grow up and choke the alfalfa Sometimes the alfalfa is
sown with the colonists last crop and in such cases the landowner
finds the alfalfa seed and during the sowing of this crop it is very
advisable that either he or his agent should be in constant attendance
because the after results greatly depend upon the care with which the
seeding has been done When the colonists contract is completed he
moves on to another part and the owner who has year by year received a
percentage of the crops takes back his land Considerable outlay has
now to be made in fences wells and buildings the more there are of
these the better the land will carry a larger head of cattle and the
control of them is easy when the camp has been properly divided
The colonists are generally Italians They are an industrious and kindly
people hardy and quiet well content with their surroundings careful
and frugal in their living and many thousands could go back to their
own country with wealth which has been acquired by constant and
assiduous attention to the economies of life
It has often been said that an Englishman will starve where an Italian
will thrive and in some respects this is true but it would be better
expressed if it were stated that an Italian can adapt himself to
circumstances better than an Englishman At the same time I doubt if an
Italian would come off best were the two placed on a desert island where
instantaneous action grit and endurance were called for
Many things are said of an Englishman and none fits his character
better than that which gives him the privilege of grumbling and this
characteristic becomes more marked when he is able to grumble with one
of his own kith and kin I have heard Argentines praise Englishmen who
they say manage their estancias far and away beyond all others but at
the same time they have told me that they would never allow two
Englishmen on their place at once
It has been said that many of the immigrants do not intend to settle in
the country Probably this idea has gained ground on account of the
large numbers of the labouring population who are attracted to
Argentina by the high wages ruling during the harvest time and then
find it pays them to go home and secure the European harvest but
generally these men come out again to stay They have acquired a
knowledge of the country and often enough have also acquired an
interest in some land and they return bringing their families to
adopt Argentina as their homefor a period at least
A glance at the statistics prepared by the authorities in Buenos Aires
shows that during the last fiftytwo years 4250980 persons entered as
immigrants and out of this number only 1690783 returned leaving in
the country 2560197 individuals or an average of 50000 workers per
annum These figures have become even more marked of recent years
Taking the last five years the country has received on an average
249000 immigrants per annum of these 103000 went back In other
words 727670 have made their homes within the borders of Argentina
during the past five years and of these at least 500000 were
agriculturists
It is not to be wondered at then that the exports chiefly made up of
agricultural produce have shown extraordinary progress Facing this
page is a diagram showing the agricultural exportation from 1900 to
1908

Nothing can be more eloquent than the figures shown in this diagram
This remarkable progress almost steady in its upward march is not in
one direction only Argentina is an ideal country for agriculturists
and in every branch of that industry progress has been made Greater
care is being taken today in working up the byproducts of the cattle
business More varied crops are being grown and vegetable byproducts
are being economically looked after The forests of Argentina are also
being worked for the benefit of mankind The Quebracho Colorado tree
