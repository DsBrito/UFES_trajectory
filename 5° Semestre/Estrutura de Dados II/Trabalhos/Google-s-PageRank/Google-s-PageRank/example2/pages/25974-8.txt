INTRODUCTION
Come now and let us reason together saith the LordIsaiah
If any man willeth to do his will he shall know of the
teaching whether it is of God or whether I speak from my
selfJesus
And ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with
all your heartJeremiah
Then shall we know if we follow on to know the LordHosea
This work is not written for sceptics yet while preparing to write
for the benefit of others than sceptics the authors heart has gone
out toward that large class of his fellowmen who are sceptical who
from different causes have been led to doubt or deny the Bibles
being a revelation from God and he has yearned to say something that
would at least arouse the attention of this class sufficiently to
cause them to give an earnest investigation or reinvestigation to
the question The bare possibilities that there is a Hell and a
Heaven that the soul can never cease to exist and that Jesus is the
real Saviour are enough to cause every doubting one to give the most
earnest consideration to any evidence bearing on these questions and
to undertake the most careful investigation of anything that promises
to lead to certainty It will be admitted by every honest disbeliever
that no writer has ever made it certain that there is no future
existence that there is no Heaven that there is no Hell that Jesus
was not the Saviour The most that such writers have been able to
produce is doubts If now there is the possibility of reaching
certainty on the other side surely the reader should be willing
and anxious to undertake a calm searching examination or
reexamination of the question If there is no Heaven or Hell no
future existence no one will ever find it out before or after death
and there would be but little if anything gained if one could find
it out But if there is a Heaven and a Hell and Jesus is the Saviour
then there is everything to be gained by finding it out and everything
to be lost by neglecting to find it out So important are the issues
at stake that you reader should be willing to take years if need
be to make a thorough investigation of the matter you should be
willing to read and study many books and there are many that would
help you but I wish to urge you to read two books only before
reading this book Surely your eternal destiny and the destinies of
those over whom you have an influence for none of us liveth to
himself are enough to cause you to give earnest attention to the
reading of three small books The bare possibility that the reading of
the three books may lead to your making sure of Heaven as your eternal
home is enough to prompt you to read them and to read them most
carefully and prayerfully The first is The Wonders of Prophecy by
John Urquhart The second is The Philosophy of the Plan of
Salvation by J B Walker American Edition Having read these two
books prayerfully and carefully then give this book a careful
reading
But let the reader consider Gods plan for investigating It is often
said by a certain class of sceptics that the Bible is against honest
investigation that it shuts off the use of ones reason Let the
word of God speak for itself Come now and let us reason together
saith the LordIs 118 The trouble with many sceptics is that
they are not willing to reason together to reason to get with
God but that they reason against God and to get away from God
Jesus said Take heed how ye hear Watch your hearts attitude
when you hear The attitude of being against God will warp your
reasoning when you hear Gods promise is plain to the earnest honest
seeker after God And ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall
search for me with all your heartJer 2913 One who is
halfhearted indifferent prejudiced against God or against truth
has no right to expect to find God or to find truth But the promise
is positive that the one who seeks with all the heart shall find Let
the reader put God to the test How can an earnest honest man refuse
to make an earnest honest investigation
It was against those who would not make such an investigation that
Jesus spoke Matt 1242 The queen of the south shall rise up in the
judgement with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from
the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon and behold a
greater than Solomon is here The heathen woman who went to so much
trouble and expense and took so much time to make a thorough honest
investigation for the truth will condemn those who do not make an
earnest persevering investigation And behold a greater than Solomon
is here with His promise If any man willeth to do his will he
shall know
Reader will you carelessly refuse to take the time and to go to the
trouble and expense of getting and reading earnestly two books that
may lead you to the truth Oh reader outstrip the heathen queen in
search of light Give your lifetime if need be to an earnest
investigation of this matter Picture two men one giving his
lifetime to earnest honest searching for the truth concerning sin
and salvation through Christ the other from indifference or pride
or prejudice or love of the world or secret sin never making an
earnest honest investigation the one dying and going to Heaven the
other dying and going to Hell Which shall it be in your case reader
There is absolutely no uncertainty as to the result if only you will
be honest and earnest and persevering in your search for the truth
Listen to Jesus John 717 If any man willeth to do his will he
shall know of the teaching whether it is of God or whether I speak
from myself Whether you reader are ignorant or learned cuts
absolutely no figure in this case Jesus throws the assurance open to
any man The one condition is if he willeth to do his will No
man wills to do Gods will who will not go to the extreme of earnest
honest prayerful investigation If you do then the veracity the
very character of Jesus is at stake Consider then reader the
awful responsibility that rests upon you if you do not give attention
to a thorough earnest honest prayerful investigation for the truth
Another promise of equal certainty comes from the Old Testament Hosea
63 Then shall we know if we follow on to know the Lord Many make
a slight search and cease The promise is not to them but to those
who persevere If we use the light as we receive it and follow it up
we shall know Again certainty is promised Does not God because He
is God deserve such earnest consideration from you reader Have you
any right to expect anything from Him if you approach Him in a
halfhearted indifferent way
The following cases in point may encourage the reader Two learned men
decided to prove that the Bible was not from God and that Jesus
Christ was not the Saviour but they were in earnest and they were
honest They had vast libraries at their service They gave months to
investigation They were both convinced and accepted the Saviour and
wrote their books in defence of the Bible instead of against it
Second one of the greatest scholars of Europe probably the greatest
stated in a public lecture in America that of the thirty leading
sceptics of the nineteenth century men who had written brilliant
books in their young manhood against the Bible he knew twentyeight
in their old age and that every one of the twentyeight after mature
investigation had accepted the Lord Jesus as Saviour
Again in one of the prominent smaller cities of America a club of
sceptics leading business and professional men had held weekly
meetings for many years They challenged any one to meet one of their
widely known lecturers in a public debate on Christianity and
Infidelity A preacher accepted the challenge During the debate some
of the sceptics became Christians The president of the debate a
sceptic is now an earnest follower of the Lord Jesus having been
convinced and having accepted Him as Saviour The debate was held
years ago So convincing so overwhelming was the evidence produced
by the defender of Christianity that the club of sceptics has never
held a meeting since the debate
Similar facts could be produced indefinitely but these three are
sufficient to show the most discouraged the most hopeless sceptical
reader that there is at least a possibility of his yet finding the
truth Is not a bare possibility where there are so tremendously
important eternal issues at stake sufficient to cause him to at once
begin a thorough prayerful honest investigation
A reflection before closing the Introduction one hundred years from
now and you reader will not be among the living Where will you be
God has given you a will and the power of choice Will you will will
you choose to make an honest persistent investigation Tremendous
consequences turn on your decisionyour own future destiny the
destinies of others over whom you have an influence Do not dally with
delay Begin now an honest earnest painstaking prayerful
investigation Get and read the two books suggested and then finish
reading this book If this course does not settle your difficulties
read on study on pray on and Gods promise is sure that you shall
find that you shall know

SIN AND ITS PUNISHMENTGODS JUSTICEDEGREES IN HELL
All have sinnedRom 323
Every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense
of rewardHeb 22
A just GodIs 4521
It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of
judgement than for theeMatt 1124
Reader what you and I need to know concerning Gods plan with the
sinner the lost is not what some people think nor what some teach
nor what some desire but what God teaches God is just Fasten that
in your mind never lose sight of it Over and over again is this fact
impressed in the Scriptures Yet lurking in the minds of multitudes is
a vague suspicion or dread that God will be unjust in sending some to
Hell and that He will be unjust in the way He will punish Many who
are thus disturbed lose sight of the fact that God is just that
whatever God does in regard to the lost one thing is certainHe
will do no injustice With my loved ones with your loved ones with
the most obscure worthless creature with the most refined delicate
nature with the most cruel debased creature that ever lived God
will do no wrong Many have turned away to infidelity not on account
of the Bibles complete teaching as to future punishment but because
they have taken some one passage of Scripture and warped it or gotten
from it a distorted idea of the Bibles teachings as to Hell or they
have taken some preachers views as to the Bibles teachings on the
subject For example here is a boy fifteen years of age whose mother
died when he was an infant whose father is a drunkard and gambler and
infidel who has given the boy but little moral training and here is
a man seventy years of age who had a noble father and mother who gave
their boy every advantage the best of training under the best of
influences yet he when a boy turned away from all these influences
and spent his life in sin and debauchery and in leading others into
sin These two the unfortunate boy and the old hardened sinner die
With many the idea is that God consigns them to a common punishment in
Hell But reader remember that God is just and if that is
justice what would injustice be They were different in light and in
opportunity and in sins and yet punished alike The Bible does not
teach it
But let us go back and consider this question of sin All have
sinned That includes you reader To him that knoweth to do good
and doeth it not to him it is sinJames 417 All have done this
have failed to live up to the light they have had hence All have
sinned Two questions arise first ought sin to be punished Second
ought all sin to be punished or only the coarser grosser more
offensive sins As to the first ought sin to be punished There is a
strong drift toward the teaching that sin ought to be punished only
for the purpose of reforming the sinner Intelligent men endorse this
teaching without realizing that it is spiritual anarchy and absolutely
horrible and detestable A woman and four little children are
murdered in cold blood by three robbers for the purpose of robbing the
home When the three are arrested the first is found to be thoroughly
penitent thoroughly reformed brokenhearted over his horrible
crime If sin should be punished only to reform the sinner this man
should not be punished at all though he murdered five people in cold
blood for he is already reformed The second is such a hardened
criminal that he never can be reformed and the more he is punished
the more hardened he will become Then if sin is punished only to
reform the sinner he should not be punished at all though guilty of
the murder of five people in cold blood The third is tenderhearted
and easily influenced and by sending him to prison for thirty days
he will be thoroughly reformed though guilty of five coldblooded
murders On this principle of punishing sin only to reform the sinner
all a sinner would have to do to make sure of Heaven would be to
become such a hardened sinner that he could never be reformed and
then he would go to Heaven without any punishment at all
People need to call a halt and realize that sin ought to be punished
because it is right to punish it because it is just But this means
the punishment of all sins the sins of the refined as surely as the
sins of the debased the smaller sins as surely as the greater sins
Hence the teaching of Gods word Rom 118 The wrath of God1 is
revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of
men But we need to keep in mind that it is discriminating wrath and
Gods word makes this plain Heb 22 Every transgression and
disobedience received a just recompense of reward A just
GodIs 4521
1 Many sneer at a God of wrath and say they believe in a God of
all love God is love but He is just as surely a God of wrath and
were He not a God of wrath He would not be God but a fiend He who
loves purity and chastity and has no wrath against impurity and
unchastity but loves them too is a moral leper He who loves the
defence of the poor and the helpless but has no wrath against the
coldblooded murderer the one crushing the defenceless but loves
him too is a fiend Character from God to Devil can only be
told by what one loves and what one hates
Notice how clearly the Saviour teaches this same great truth Matt
112024 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his
mighty works were done because they repented not Woe unto thee
Chorazin Woe unto thee Bethsaida for if the mighty works had been
done in Tyre and Sidon which were done in you they would have
repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes But I say unto you It
shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgement
than for you And thou Capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt
be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done
in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained until this day
But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of
Sodom in the day of judgement than for thee Notice more
tolerable difference in punishment
The same teaching Jesus gives in Mark 1240 These shall receive
greater condemnation Jesus revealed to Pilate Gods judgment of a
difference in sin John 1911 He that delivered me unto thee hath
the greater sin
And Paul teaches the same Gal 67 Whatsoever a man soweth that
shall he also reap the reaping according to the sowing
Let the reader notice the clear teaching the punishment of sin will
be graded first according to light and opportunity A writer a
great scientist held that heredity and environment largely determine
ones destiny That is what Jesus taught The people of Sodom were
more wicked than those of Capernaum but heredity and environment were
against them The people of Capernaum had not sinned so terribly as
the people of Sodom but they had more light and opportunity they had
better heredity better environment Jesus says that therefore the
people of Capernaum shall be punished more severely than the people of
Sodom And that is right that is just
Those to whom Jesus spoke were born under better conditions than those
of Sodom they grew up under more favorable surroundings hence they
were more responsible hence they are to receive greater punishment
at the judgment Apply to your own case reader for every added ray
of light for every added opportunity there will be that much added
punishment for your sins And that is just that is right The
opportunities that wealth brings the light that education and culture
bring will but add to the punishment at the judgment The most highly
educated the most refined the most wealthy those who have lived
under the most favorable influences will suffer most at the judgment
But punishment will be further graded by the number of the
sinsEvery transgression received a just recompense Hence the
more one sins the greater the punishment If one knew that he was
going to Hell corrupt human nature would say Sin and enjoy while
you live but reason and Scripture would say Stop add no more to
the degree of Hell
Punishment for sin will be further graded by the character of the sin
He that betrayed me to thee hath the greater sin While a small sin
is just as surely sin as a great sin yet God recognizes degrees in
sin and as a consequence there are degrees in the punishment of sin
Following from degrees in the punishment of sin comes inevitably the
fact that no wrong will be done any one at the judgment that no one
will be treated wrong in Hell He who fears only injustice and wrong
has nothing to fear from the judgment or in Hell
Two reflections for the readerIf you have heretofore rebelled
against the idea of future punishment what can you say when now you
see that God will make all just allowance for surroundings and
conditions and will take into consideration the number and kinds of
sins God has a right to have laws His laws are right a law without
a penalty amounts to no law the penalty God assures us will be
absolutely just What can you say when you stand before such a judge
and receive such a sentence
The other reflection for the reader Let not this teaching of the
Bible lead you into thinking that Hell then will not be so terrible
after all and that you need not fear it Instead of letting it allay
all dread of the future it is enough to make the blood run cold
through your veins for those who will have the most terrible
suffering will be the most enlightened the most cultured
Another thought not some far distant cold harsh unsympathetic God
will be the judge at the Judgment Day but the Lord Jesus touched
with the feeling of our infirmities will be the one who will judge
you and condemn you and give you your just degree of punishment in
Hell Hear Him John 522 Neither doth the Father judge any man but
he hath given all judgement to the Son Peter reveals the same fact
Acts 1042 He commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify
that this is he who hath been ordained of God to be the judge of
living and dead Remember that he whom the world praises as so good
so just so discriminating so loving so tender will be the judge at
the Great Day who will pronounce each sentence Oh reader the very
fact that the Lord Jesus will be the judge is absolute proof that no
one will be treated wrong that no one will be punished unjustly in
Hell and the bare possibility that He may pronounce your eternal doom
is enough to cause you to turn today Turn ye turn ye for why will
ye die
FOR FURTHER STUDY The fear of Abraham is the fear of the human
race Gen 1825 Shall not the judge of all the earth do right As
soon as God revealed to Abraham that he was going to deal with Sodom
and Gomorrah because of their sin Abraham at once suspects that God
may do wrong in punishing sin It has been so down the ages that we
suspect that God will do wrong in punishing sin Great denominations
have been formed to keep God from doing wrong in punishing sin Men
have proven untrue to their denominations and turned traitors to Gods
word because they have Abrahamlike suspected God of wrongdoing in
the punishment of sin It is not that the proof is not ample that the
Bible is Gods word but the hatred of the human heart for the Bible
teaching about Hell that has brought in so much of modern religious
vagaries and New Theology and Higher Criticism As Abraham presses his
plea for God to do right God by degrees reveals Himself as a God who
will do right It must have been a marvellous revelation to Abraham
And so Gods plan for the punishment of sin will be to the honest
seeker for truth when he perceives the real teaching of Gods word As
Gods doing right with Sodom and Gomorrah went far beyond where
Abrahams sense of right halted so Gods doing right with sinners in
Hell will go far beyond what we would ask
But there are other objectors to Hell They began by pressing the
teaching of Gods mercy without any reference to His justice and in
order to get rid of the teaching as to Hell which they thought
unjust they rejected the Scriptures as Gods word and finally ended
in rejecting the teaching that Christ died for our sins 1 Cor
153 that He his own self bare our sins in his own body upon the
tree 1 Peter 224 As a result of their fighting against Gods
punishing sin they have become so blinded as to right principle and
so morally corrupt as to be supported in pulpits college
professorships and seminary professorships by the hardearned money of
earnest believers in Gods word while they are undermining the faith
of the children of their supporters
The Heaven that such men teach is the Hell of the Bible Rejecting
complete redemption through Christ dying for our sins as our
substitute they teach salvation by character or that ones destiny
beyond the grave will be according to the way he has lived here That
is their Heaven but that is the Bibles Hell exactly absolutely
Infidelity Judaism Christian Science Universalism Unitarianism
Higher Criticism New Theology and all who reject Christ dying for our
sins as our substitute as our complete Redeemer because of their
hatred of Gods punishing sinners in Hell have made their Heaven to
be the result of their life here on earth and as a consequence have
made their Heaven the Bibles Hell for Hell will be exactly the
result of the life here on earth and as a result they have in
theory and alas will have in fact the Bibles Hell which they
label Heaven without any real Heaven at all As an example consider
Mr R G Ingersolls words I believe in the gospel of justice that
we must reap what we sow Bibles Hell without any Heaven I do not
believe in forgiveness Bibles Hell without any Heaven If I rob
Smith and God forgives me how does that help Smith If I cover some
poor girl with the leprosy of some imputed crime and she withers away
like a blighted flower and afterward I get forgiveness how does that
help her If there is another world we have got to settle admitting
that we do not settle in this life and for every crime you commit
here hence the more the crimes the more you must suffer exactly
the Bibles teaching you must answer to yourself and to the one you
injure And if you have ever clothed another as with a garment of
pain you will never be quite as happy as though you had not done that
thing No forgiveness eternal inexorable everlasting justice
that is what I believe in Any Christian would be willing to take Mr
Ingersolls place or the place of any one else in Hell if God
varies one pang from what Mr Ingersoll himself calls for But it is
the Bibles Hell pure and simple without any Heaven
But the objector who rejects the teaching of Hell and also Christ
dying for our sins as our substitute may say that he does not agree
with Mr Ingersoll as to no forgiveness that he believes in
forgiveness To reject Christs dying for our sins as our substitute
as our Redeemer from all iniquity and yet in order to avoid
believing in Hell to profess to believe in the forgiveness of sins
makes one far worse than Mr Ingersoll a spiritual anarchist Mr
Ingersoll at least believed in law but to believe in forgiveness
without substitution without redemption through Christ means to down
with law and to become an anarchist in principle As to the justice of
substitution the reader is referred to Chapter III
Concerning the objection to the Bibles teaching of eternal punishment
in Hell a mistranslation has misled many and before the correct
translation as given by the Revised Version all objections fall to
the ground The old version of Rev 2211 reads He that is unjust
let him be unjust still but the Revised Version gives what the
Greek says He that is unrighteous let him do unrighteousness
still And that inevitably means eternal punishment It is Gods
last sentence on the sinner The objector may say that it is horrible
to let men sin beyond the grave in Hell Not one particle more
horrible is it than to let them sin in this life and continue in sin
in this life A reflection for the unsaved reader what will your
moral character be one thousand years after you die with no holy
Spirit no Bible no Christians no churches to restrain you
Again this passage Rev 2211 R V can have no meaning if the
wicked are to be blotted out cease to exist
Another objection that is pressed is that the Bible teaches a Hell of
literal fire and is therefore wrong The denominations that reject
the Bibles teachings as to Hell without exception try to force on
the Bible language the meaning of literal fire Yet they do not try to
force on the language of the Bible concerning Hell that it means
literal worm when it says to be cast into Hell where their worm dieth
not and the fire is not quenched They do not try to force the
literal meaning on language when Jesus said I am the door I am
the vine or the Scriptures state That rock was Christ One thing
is true that the language being figurative the reality must be
terrible
Men sneer at the thought of becoming Christians from fear of Hell
Such men are not honest with God and are simply trying to browbeat
God on the subject of Hell Proof the same men will flee to safety
from fear of smallpox from fear of yellow fever etc Shall men be
looked upon as sensible when they flee to safety for their bodies and
be scorned for fleeing to safety for their souls
People are ever asking Will the heathen be lost without the gospel
Let Gods word answer Rom 212 14 As many as have sinned without
the law shall also perish without the law For when Gentiles that
have not the law do by nature the things of the law these not having
the law are the law unto themselves in that they show the work of the
law written in their hearts their conscience bearing witness
therewith and their thoughts one with another accusing or else
excusing themselves But the objector says Will God condemn a man
when he has no light There never lived such a man Listen to God
John 119 That was the true light that lighteth every man coming
into the world Again Rom 120 The invisible things of him since
the creation of the world are clearly seen being perceived through
the things that are made even his everlasting power and divinity so
that they are without excuse But the objection is raised that they
have never heard of Christ and that it is wrong for people to be
lost condemned who never heard of Christ They are not condemned for
not believing in Christ when they have never heard of Him they are
condemned for their sins for doing what from their light they knew
was wrong It is not the lack of the remedy that kills but the
disease They have not as much light as others and their punishment
will be accordingly The man who dies in his sins in a Christian land
will be punished far far more than the one who dies a heathen Their
punishments will be almost as far apart as the east is from the west
The Scripture There is no difference Rom 322 has often been
pressed to mean that all sinners are alike before God or will suffer
alike in Hell By close attention to the passage the reader will see
that the expression there is no difference has reference to what
goes before for it is connected by the word for pointing back to
what had just been said that there is a righteousness of God through
faith in Jesus Christ unto all that have faith for there is no
difference that all that have faith are equally certain of
salvation for there is no difference To join the expression
there is no difference with what follows makes it clearly
contradict our Saviour who said plainly that there is a
differenceHe that delivered me unto thee hath the greater
sinthere is a difference in sin says the Saviour
The teaching of James 210 For whosoever shall keep the whole law
and yet offend in one point is guilty of all must not be made to
contradict the plain teaching of the Saviour that there is a
difference in sinners and different degrees in their punishment The
meaning is that the law is a unit and that he that offends in one
point has broken the law as a whole A chain of ten links is as surely
broken when one link is broken as when all ten links are broken
In accord with this are the words of the great American scholar
theologian teacher preacher Jno A Broadus Especially notice
Luke 1247 f R V And that servant which knew his lords will
and made not ready nor did according to his will shall be beaten
with many stripes but he that knew not and did things worthy of
stripes shall be beaten with few stripes This teaching has been in
many cases grievously overlooked Taking images literally men have
found that the Gehenna of fire Matt 522 will be the same place
