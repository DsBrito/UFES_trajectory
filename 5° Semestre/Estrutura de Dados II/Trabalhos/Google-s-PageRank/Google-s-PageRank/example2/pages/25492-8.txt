years ago I want a quiet life So I would not assert that the
recruiting officer deliberately lied to me but I was the worst deceived
man that ever enlisted and if I ever meet that man on this earth it
will go hard with him Of course if he is dead that settles it as I
shall not follow any man after death where I am in doubt as to which
road he has taken but if he is alive and reads these lines he can
hear of something to his advantage by communicating with me I would
probably kill him As far as the bounty was concerned I got that all
right but it was only threehundred dollars Within twentyfour hours
after I had been credited to the town from which I enlisted I heard of
a town that was paying as high as twelvehundred dollars for recruits
I have met with many reverses of fortune in the course of a short but
brilliant career have loaned money and never got it back have been
taken in by designing persons on three card monte and have been beaten
trading horses but I never suffered much more than I did when I found
that I had got to go to war for a beggerly threehundred dollars bounty
when I could have had twelve hundred dollars by being credited to
another town I think that during two years and a half of service
nothing tended more to dampen my ardor make me despondent and hate
myself than the loss of that ninehundred dollars bounty There was not
an hour of the day in all of my service that I did not think of what
might have been It was a long time before I brought to my aid that
passage of scripture There is no use crying for spilled bounty but
when I did it helped me some I thought of the hundreds who didnt get
any bounty
I joined my regiment and had a cavalry horse issued to me and was
assigned to a company I went up to the captain of the company whom I
had known as a farmer before the war commenced and told him I had come
to help him put down the rebellion I never saw a man so changed as he
was I thought he would ask me to bring my things into his tent and
stay with him but he seemed to have forgotten that he had known me
when he worked on the farm He was dressed up nicely and I thought he
put on style and I could only think of him at home with his overalls
tucked in his boots driving a yoke of oxen to plow a field He seemed
to feel that I had known him under unfavorable circumstances before the
war and acted as though he wanted to shun me I had drawn an infantry
knapsack at Madison before I left for the front and had it full of
things besides a small trunk The captain called a soldier and told him
to find quarters for me and I went out of his presence At my quarters
which consisted of what was called a puptent I found no conveniences
and it soon dawned on me that war was no picnic as that lying
recruiting officers had told me it was I found that I had got to throw
away my trunk and knapsack and all the articles that I couldnt strap
on a saddle and when I asked for a mattress the men laughed at me I
had always slept on a mattress or a feather bed and when I was told
that I would have to sleep on the ground under that little tent I felt
hurt I had known the colonel when he used to teach school at home and
I went to him and told him what kind of a way they were treating me
but he only laughed He had two nice cots in his tent and I told him
I thought I ought to have a cot too He laughed some more Finally I
asked him who slept in his extra cot and intimated that I had rather
sleep in his tent than mine but he sent me away and said he would see
what could be done I laid on the ground that night but I didnt sleep
If I ever get a pension it will be for rheumatism caught by sleeping on
the ground The rheumatism has not got hold of me yet though twentytwo
years have passed but it may be lurking about my system for all I
know
I had never rode a horse before enlisting The only thing I had ever
got straddle of was a stool in a country printing office and when I
was first ordered to saddle up my horse I could not tell which way the
saddle and bridle went and I got a colored man to help me for which I
paid him some of the remains of my bounty I hired him permanently to
take care of my horse but I soon learned that each soldier had to take
care of his own horse That seemed pretty hard I had been raised a pet
and had edited a newspaper which had been one of the most outspoken
advocates of crushing the rebellion and it seemed to me as much as I
had done for the government in urging enlistments I was entitled to
more consideration then to become my own hostler However I curbed my
proud spirit and after the nigger cook had saddled my horse I led the
animal up to a fence to climb on From the remarks of the soldiers and
the general laugh all around it was easy to see that mounting a cavalry
horse from off the top of a rail fence was not according to tactics
but it was the only way I could see to get on in the absence of
stepladders They let me ride into the ranks after mounting and then
they laughed It was hard for me to be obliged to throw away all the
articles I had brought with me so I strapped them on the saddle in
front and behind and only my head stuck out over them There was one
thing it would be a practicable impossibility to fall off
Illustration Mounting a horse from the top of a rail fence 021
The regiment started on a raid The colonel came along by my company
during the afternoon and I asked him where we were going He gave me an
evasive answer which hurt my feelings I asked his pardon but told him
I would like to know where we were going so as to have my letters
sent to me but he went off laughing and never told me while the old
soldiers laughed though I couldnt see what they were laughing at
I did not suppose there was so much difference between officers and
privates and wondered if it was the policy of this government to have
a cavalry regiment to start off on a long raid and not let the soldiers
know where they were going and during the afternoon I decided to write
home to the paper I formerly edited and give my opinion of such a fool
way of running a war Suppose anybody at home was sick they wouldnt
know where to write for me to come back There is nothing that will give
a man such an appetite as riding on a galloping horse and along about
the middle of the afternoon I began to get hungry and asked the orderly
sergeant when we were going to get any dinner He said there was a hotel
a short distance ahead and the colonel had gone forward to order dinner
for the regiment I believed him because I had known the orderly before
the war when he drove a horse in a brickyard grinding clay But he
was a liar too as I found out afterwards There was not a hotel within
fifty miles and soldiers did not stop at hotels anyway Finally the
orderly sergeant came along and announced that dinner was ready and I
looked for the hotel but the only dinner I saw was some raw pork that
soldiers took out of their saddle bags with hard tack We stopped in
the woods dismounted and the boys would cut off a slice of fat pork
and spread it on the hard tack and eat it I had never supposed the
government would subject its soldiers to such fare as that and I
wouldnt eat I did not dare dismount as there was no fence near that
I could use to climb on to my horse so I sat in the saddle and let the
horse eat some grass while I thought of home and pie and cake and
what a condemned fool a man was to leave a comfortable home to go
and put down anybodys rebellion The way I felt then I wouldnt have
touched a rebellion if one lay right in the road What business was it
of mine if some people in the South wanted to dissolve partnership and
go set up business for themselves How was I going to prevent them
from having a southern confederacy by riding an old rack of bones of a
horse that would reach his nose around every little while and chew my
legs If the recruiting officer who inveigled me into the army had
come along then his widow would now be drawing a pension While I was
thinking dreaming of home and the horse was eating grass the fool
animal suddenly took it into his head to lay down and roll and before I
could kick any of his ribs in he was down and I was rolling off with
one leg under him The soldiers quit eating and pulled the horse of
me and hoisted me up into the space between my baggage and then they
laughed lit their pipes and smoked as happy as could be I couldn t
see how they could be happy and wondered if they were not sick of war
Then they mounted and on we went My legs and body became chafed and
it seemed as though I couldn t ride another minute and when the captain
came along I told him about it and asked him if I couldn t be relieved
some way He said the only way was for me to stand on my head and ride
and he winked at a soldier near me and do you know that soldier
actually changed ends with himself and stood on his head and hands in
the saddle and rode quite a distance and the captain said that was the
way a cavalry soldier rested himself Gracious I wouldn t have tried
that for the world and I found out afterwards that the soldier who
stood on his head formerly belonged with a circus
I suppose it was wrong to complain but the horse they gave me was the
meanest horse in the regiment He would bite and kick the other horses
and they would kick back and about half the time I was dodging the
heels of horses and a good deal of the time I was wondering if a man
would get any pension if he was wounded that way It would seem pretty
tough to go home on a stretcher as a wounded soldier and have people
find out a horse kicked you I never had been a man of blood and didnt
enlist to kill anybody as I could prove by that recruiting officer
and I didn t want to fight but from what I could gather from the
conversation of the soldiers fighting and killing people was about all
they thought about They talked about this one and that one who had been
killed and the hundreds of confederates they had all shot or killed
with sabres until my hair just stood right up It seems that twelve or
fifteen men more or less had been shot off the horse I was riding and
one fellow who rode next to me said no man who ever rode that old yellow
horse had escaped alive This was cheering to me and I would have given
my three hundred dollars bounty and all I could borrow if I could get
out of the army However I found out afterwards that the soldier lied
In fact they all lied and they lied for my benefit We struck into the
woods and traveled until after dark with no road and the march was
enlivened by remarks of the soldiers near me to the effect that we would
probably never get out of the woods alive They said we were trying to
surround an army of rebels and cut them off from the main army and the
chances were that when tomorrows sun rose it would rise on the ghostly
corpses of the whole regiment with jackals and buzzards eating us
One of the soldiers took something from his pocket about the size of
a testament pressed it to his heart and then kissed it and I felt as
though I was about to faint but by the light of a match which another
soldier had scratched on his pants to light his pipe I saw that what I
supposed to be a testament was a box of sardines the soldier had bought
of the sutler I was just about to die of hunger exhaustion and fright
at the fearful stories the veterans had been telling when there was
a shout at the head of the regiment which was taken up all along the
line my horse run under the limb of a tree and raked me out of the
saddle and I hung to the limb my legs hanging down and

The careful readers of this history have no doubt been worried about the
manner in which the first chapter closed leaving me hanging to a limb
of a tree like Absalom weeping for her children my horse having gone
out from under me But I have not been hanging there all this time The
soldiers took me down and caught my horse and the regiment dismounted
and a council of war was held I suppose it was a council of war as I
noticed the officers were all in a group under a tree with a candle
examining a map and drinking out of a canteen I had read of councils
of war but I had never seen one and so I walked over to the crowd
of officers and asked the colonel if there was anything particular the
matter I never saw a crowd of men who seemed so astonished as those
officers were and suddenly I felt myself going away from where they
were consulting with somebodys strong hand on my collar and an
unmistakable cavalry boot with a man in it in the vicinity of my
pantaloons I do not know to this day which officer it was that kicked
me but I went away and sat under a tree in the dark so hungry that I
was near dead and I wished I was dead I guess the officers wished
that I was too The soldiers tried to console me by telling me I was
too fresh but I couldnt see why a private soldier right from home
who knew all about the public sentiment at the north in regard to the
way the war was conducted should not have a voice in the consultations
of officers I had written many editorials before I left home
criticising the manner in which many generals had handled their
commands and pointed out to my readers how defeat could have been
turned into victory if the generals had done as I would have done in
their places It seemed to me the officers of my regiment were taking a
suicidal course in barring me out of their consultations A soldier had
told me that we were lost in the woods and as I had studied geography
when at school and was well posted about Alabama it seemed as though a
little advice from me would be worth a good deal But I concluded to let
them stay lost forever before I would volunteer any information It was
crawling along towards midnight of my first day in the army and I
had eaten nothing since morning As I sat there under the tree I fell
asleep and was dreaming of home and warm biscuit with honey and a
feather bed when I was rudely awakened by a corporal who told me to
mount I asked him what for and told him that I didn t want to ride any
more that night What I wanted was to be let alone to sleep He said to
get on the horse too quick and I found there was no use arguing with a
common corporal so the boys hoisted me on to the horse and about nine
of us started off through the woods in the moonlight looking for a main
road The corporal was kind enough to say that as soon as we found a
road we would put out a picket and send a courier back to the regiment
to inform the colonel that we had got out of the woods and the rest of
us would lay down and sleep till morning I dont think I was ever so
anxious to see a road in all my life because I did want to lay down
and sleep and die O if I could have telegraphed home how I would
have warned the youth of the land to beware of the allurements held out
by recruiting officers and to let war alone In an hour or so we came
to a clearing and presently to a road and we stopped The corporal
detailed me to go up the road a short distance and stand picket on my
horse That was not what I had expected of the corporal I used to know
him before the war when he worked in a paint shop in a wagon factory
and I had always treated him well and it seemed as though he ought
to favor me by letting somebody else go on picket I told him that the
other boys were more accustomed to such work than I was and that I
would resign in their favor because what I wanted was rest but he
said I would have to go and he called me Camp and Garrison Equipage
because I carried so much luggage on my horse a name that held to
me for months I found that there was no use kicking against going on
picket duty that night though I tried to argue with the corporal that
it would be just as well to all lay down and sleep till morning and
put out a picket when it got light enough to see I was willing to work
during the day time for the government but it seemed as though it was
rushing things a little to make a man work day and night for thirteen
dollars a month So the corporal went out on the road with me about
a quarter of a mile and placed me in position and gave me my
instructions The instructions were to keep a sharp lookout up and down
the road for Confederate cavalry and if I saw anybody approaching to
sing out halt and if the party did not halt to shoot him and then
call for the corporal of the guard who would come out to see what was
the matter I asked him what I should do if anybody came along and shot
me and he said that would be all right that the boys would come out
and bury me He said I must keep awake for if I got to sleep on my post
I would be courtmartialed and shot and then he rode away and left
me alone on a horse that kept whinnying and calling the attention of
possible Confederates to my position
I do not think any reader of these papers will envy me the position I
was in at that time If I remained awake I was liable to be killed by
the enemy and if I fell asleep on my post I would be shot anyway
And if I was not killed it was probable I would be a murderer before
morning Hunger was gnawing at my stomach and the horse was gnawing
at my legs and I was gnawing at a hard tack which I had found in the
saddlebag Every little while I would hear a noise and my hair would
raise my hat up and it would seem to me as though the next minute a
volley would be fired at me and I shrunk down between the piles of
baggage on my saddle to be protected from bullets Suddenly the moon
came out from behind a cloud and around a turn in the road a solitary
horseman might have been seen coming towards me I never have seen a
horse that looked as high as that horse did He seemed at least eighteen
feet high and the man on him was certainly twelve feet high My heart
pounded against a tin canteen that I had strung around my shoulder so
I could hear the beating perfectly plain The man was approaching and I
was trying to think whether I had been instructed to shoot and then call
for the corporal of the guard or call for the corporal and then ask him
to halt I knew there was a halt in my instructions and wondered if
it would not conciliate the enemy to a certain extent if I would say
Please Halt The fact was I didn t want to have any fuss If I could
have backed my horse up into the woods and let the man go by it seemed
as though it would save precipitating a conflict It is probable that
no military man was ever in so tight a place as I was that minute The
enemy was advancing and I wondered if when he got near enough I could
say halt in a commanding tone of voice I knew enough then to feel
that to ask the stranger to halt in a trembling and husky voice would
give the whole thing away that I was a recruit and a coward Ye gods
how I suffered I wondered if I could hit a man with a bullet Before
the war I was quite a good shot with a shotgun shooting into flocks of
pigeons and ducks and I thought what a good idea it would be if I could
get that approaching rebel into a flock The idea seemed so ridiculous
that I laughed right out loud It was not a hearty happy laugh but it
was a laugh all the same and I was proud that I could laugh in the face
of danger when I might be a corpse any minute The man on the horse
stopped Whether he heard me laugh it is impossible to say but he
stopped That relieved me a great deal As he had stopped it was
unnecessary for me to invite him to halt He was welcome to stay there
if he wanted to I argued that it was not my place to go howling around
the Southern Confederacy ordering people to halt when they had already
halted If he would let me alone and stay where he was what sense was
there in picking a quarrel with him
Why should I want to shoot a total stranger who might have a family
at home somewhere in the South who would mourn for him He might be
a dead shot as many Southern gentlemen were and if I went to advising
him about halting it would very likely cause his hot Southern blood to
boil and he would say he had just as much right to that road as I had
If it come right down to the justice of the thing I should have to
admit that Alabama was not my state Wisconsin was my home and if I
was up there and a man should trespass on my property it would be
reasonable enough for me to ask him to go away from there and enforce
my request by calling a constable and having him put off the premises
But how did I know but he owned property there and was a taxpayer I
had it all figured out that I was right in not disturbing that rebel
and I knew that I could argue with my colonel for a week if necessary
on the law points in the case and the courtesy that I deemed proper
between gentlemen if any complaint was made for not doing my duty But
lordy how I did sweat while I was deciding to let him alone if he
would let me alone The war might have been going on now and that rebel
and myself might have been standing there today looking at each other
if it hadnt been for the action of the fool horse that I rode My
horse had been evidently asleep for some time but suddenly he woke up
pricked up his ears and began to prance and jump sideways like a race
horse that is on the track and wants to run The horse reared up and
plunged and kept working up nearer to my Southern friend and I tried
to hold him and keep him still but suddenly he got the best of me and
started towards the other man and horse and the other horse started as
though some one had said go
Before I get any further on this history of the war it
is necessary to explain The facts proved to be that my
regiment had got lost in the woods and the scouting party
under the corporal who had been sent out to find a road
had come upon the threequarter stretch of an old private
race track on a deserted southern plantation instead of a
main road and I had been placed on picket near the last
turn before striking the quarter stretch A small party of
Confederates who had been out on a scout and got lost had
come on the track further down near the judges stand and
they had put a man on picket up near where I was supposing
they had struck the road and intending to wait until
morning so as to find out where they were My horse was an
old race horse and as soon as he saw the other horse he
was in for a race and the other horse was willing This will
show the situation as well as though I had a race track
engraved showing the positions of the two armies The
Confederates except the man on picket were asleep beside
the track near the quarter stretch and our fellows except
myself were asleep over by the threequarter pole
I do not suppose any man on this earth or any other earth ever tried
to stop a fool horse quite as hard as I did that one I pulled until my
arms ached but he went for all that was out and the horse ahead of
me was buckling in as fast as he could I could not help wondering what
would happen if I should overtake that Southern man I was gaining on
him when suddenly eight or nine men who were sleeping beside the road
got up and began to shoot at us They were the friends of the rebel who
believed that the whole Union army was making a charge on them We got
by the shooters alive and then as we passed the rickety old judges
stand I realized that we were on a race track and for a moment I
forgot that I was a soldier and only thought of myself as a rider of
a race horse and I gave the horse his head and kicked him and yelled
like a Comanche Indian and I had the satisfaction of seeing my horse
go by the rebel and I yelled some more I got a glimpse of my rebels
face as I went by him and he didnt look much more like a fighting man
than I did but he was for as soon as I had got ahead of him he drew
a revolver and began firing at me on the run I thought that was a mean
trick and spoke to him about it afterwards but he said he only wanted
me to stop so he could get acquainted with me
Illustration On went the two night riders 039
Well I never could find any bullets in any of the clothes strapped on
the back of my saddle but it did seem to me as though every bullet
from his revolver hit very near my vital parts But a new danger
presented itself We were rapidly approaching the corporal and his men
with whose command I belonged and they would wake up and think the
whole Confederate army was charging them and if I was not killed by the
confounded rebel behind me I should probably be shot all to pieces by
our own men As we passed our men they fired a few sleepy shots towards
us and took to the woods On went the two night riders and when the
rebel had exhausted his revolver he began to urge his horse and passed
me and I drew my revolver and began to fire at him As we passed the
judges stand the second time a couple of shots from quite a distance in
the woods showed that his rebel friends had taken alarm at the frequent
charges of cavalry and had skipped to the woods and were getting away
as fast as possible We went around the track once more and when near
the judges stand I was right behind him and his horse fell down and
my horse stumbled over him and I guess we were both stunned Finally I
crawled out from under my horse and the rebel was trying to raise up
when I said What in thunder you want to chase a man all around the
Southern Confederacy for on a dark night trying to shoot him He asked
me to help him up which I did when he said Who commenced this here
chasing If you had kept whar you was I wouldnt a had no truck with
you Then I said You are my prisoner and he said No you are my
prisoner I told him I was no hand to argue but it seemed to me it was
about a stand off as to which was tothers prisoner I told him that
was my first days service as a soldier and I was not posted as to the
customs of civilized warfare but I was willing to wait till daylight
leaving matters just as they were each of us on the defensive giving
up none of our rights and after daylight we would play a game of
sevenup to see which was the prisoner That seemed fair to him and he
accepted the situation remarking that he had only been conscripted a
few days and didnt know any more about war than a cow He said he was
a newspaper man from Georgia and had been taken right from the case in
his office before his paper could be got out I told him I was only a
few days out of a country printing office myself the sheriff having
closed out my business on an old paper bill A bond of sympathy was
inaugurated at once between us and when he limped along the track to
the fence and found that his ankle was hurt by the fall I brought a
bottle of horse liniment out of my saddlebags and a rag and bound
some liniment on his ankle He said he had never seen a Yankee soldier
before and he was glad he had met me I told him he was the first rebel
I had ever met and I hoped he would be the last until the war was
over By this time our horses had gone to nibbling grass as though
there were no such thing as war We could hear occasional bugle calls
off in the woods in two directions and knew that our respective
commands had gone off and got lost again so we concluded to camp there
till morning After the excitement was over I began to get hungry and I
asked him if he had anything to eat He said he had some corn bread and
bacon and he could get some sweet potatoes over in a field So I built
a fire there on the track and he hobbled off after potatoes Just about
daylight breakfast was served consisting of coffee which I carried
in a sack made in a pot he carried bacon fried in a half of a tin
canteen sweet potatoes roasted in the ashes and Confederate corn
bread warmed by holding it over the fire on a sharp stick My friend
the rebel sat on my saddle which I had removed from my horse after he
had promised me on his honor to help me to put it on when it was time to
mount He knew how to put on saddles and I didn t and as his ankle
was lame I gave him the best seat he being my guest that is he was
my guest if I beat him in the coming game of sevenup which we were to
play to see if he was my prisoner or I was his It being daylight I
could see him and study his character and honestly he was a mighty
finelooking fellow As we eat our early breakfast I began to think
that the recruiting officer was more than half right about war being a
picnic He talked about the newspaper business in the South and before
breakfast was over we had formed a partnership to publish a paper at
Montgomery Ala after the war should be over I have eaten a great
many firstclass meals in my time have feasted at Delmonicos and
lived at the best hotels in the land besides partaking pretty fair food
camping out where an appetite was worked up by exercise and sporting
but in all my life I have never had anything taste as good as that
combination UnionConfederate breakfast on the Alabama race track
beside the judges stand After the last potato peeling and the last
crumb of corn bread had been sopped in the bacon gravy and eaten we
whittled some tobacco off a plug filled our pipes and leaned up against
the fence and smoked the most enjoyable smoke that ever was smoked
After smoking in silence a few minutes my rebel friend said as he blew
the smoke from his handsome mouth War is not so unpleasant after
all Then we fell to talking about the manner in which the different
generals on each side had conducted things He went on to show that if
Lee had taken his advice the Yankees would then be on the run for the
North and I showed him by a few wellchosen remarks that if I
could have been close to Grant and given him some pointers that the
Confederates would be hunting their holes We were both convinced that
it was a great mistake that we were nothing but private soldiers but
felt that it would not be long before we were called to occupy high
places It seemed to stand to reason that true merit would find its
reward Then he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and said if I had a
pack of cards we would go up in the judges stand and play sevenup
to see whether I was his prisoner or he was mine I wanted to take a
prisoner back to the regiment at I thought it would make me solid with
the colonel and I played a strong game of sevenup but before we got
started to playing he suggested that we call it a standoff and agree
that neither of us should be a prisoner but that when we got ready to
part each should go hunt up his own command and tell the biggest lie we
could think of as to the fight we had had That was right into my hand
and I agreed and then my friend suggested that we play poker for money
I consented and he put up Confederate money against my greenbacks ten
to one We played about an hour and at the close he had won the balance
of my bounty except what I had given to the chaplain for safe keeping
and a pair of pants and a blouse and a flannel shirt and a pair of
shoes which I had on my saddle I was rather glad to get rid of some
of my extra baggage and when he put on the clothes he had won from me
blessed if I wasn t rather proud of him A man could wear any kind of
clothes in the Confederate army and my rebel looked real comfortable in
my clothes and I felt that it was a real kind act to allow him to win
a blue suit that I did not need If the men of both the armies and the
people of both sections of the distracted country could have seen us two
soldiers together there in the judges stand peacefully playing poker
while the battles were raging in the East and in the West that would
have felt that an era of good feeling was about to dawn on the country
After we had played enough poker and I had lost everything I had that
was loose I suggested that he sing a song so he sung the Bonnie Blue
Flag I did not think it was right for him to work in a rebel song on
me but it did sound splendid and I forgot that there was any war in
listening to the rich voice of my new friend When he got through he
asked me to sing something I never could sing anyway My folks had
always told me that my voice sounded like a corn sheller but he urged
me at his own peril and I sung or tried to Well Hang Jeff Davis
to a Sour Apple Tree I had no designs on Mr Davis honestly I hadnt
and it was the farthest thing from my thoughts to hurt the feelings of
that young man but before I had finished the first verse he took his
handkerchief out and placed it to his eyes I stopped and apologized
but he said not to mind him as he was better now He told me
afterwards in the strictest confidence that my singing was the worst
he ever heard and gave it as his opinion that if Jeff Davis could hear
me sing he would be willing even anxious to be hung If I had been
sensitive about my musical talents probably there would have been hard
feelings and possibly bloodshed right there but I told him I always
knew I couldnt sing and he said that I was in luck Well we fooled
around there till about ten oclock in the morning and decided that we
would part and each seek our respective commands so I put some more
horse liniment on his sprained ankle and he saddled my horse for me
and after expressions of mutual pleasure at meeting each other and
promises that after the war we would seek each other out we mounted
he gave three cheers for the Yanks and I gave three cheers for the
Johnnies he divided his plug of tobacco with me and I gave him the
bottle of horse liniment he turned his horse towards the direction his
gray coats had taken the night before while I turned my horse towards
the hole in the woods our fellows had made and we left the race track
where we had fought so gamely eat so heartily and played poker so
disastrously to me As we were each about going into the woods half
