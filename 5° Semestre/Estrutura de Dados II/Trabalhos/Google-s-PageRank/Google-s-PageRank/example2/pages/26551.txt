will be indicated with each document serial in the following list
First of all there is the system of depository distribution which is
based on the act of January 12 1895 The idea is to place in all
sections of the country complete collections of all public documents
which are printed and made for distribution This privilege is granted
by law or through the request of senators and representatives The
second way in which large numbers of documents are distributed is
through the congressional quota This practice is a very old one being
used for the first time in 1791 Each member of Congress is given a
quota of all documents published by that body the number varying with
each document These are distributed by the order of the congressmen
and are sent out under their franks As a rule the libraries will
receive very prompt and courteous attention from their representative
in Congress to any request made for publications Thirdly the
departments and bureaus have mailing lists including public officials
institutions of various kinds and interested people Usually a request
by a library to be placed upon such a list is granted if not a letter
to the congressman will bring the desired result Finally the
Superintendent of Documents is authorized to sell the government
publications at a price sufficient to cover the actual expense of
paper press work and binding The amount is always small because the
main costs of typesetting and stereotyping are eliminated from the
price There are some publications which are secured by sale only this
rule applying to libraries as well as to individuals
The list of publications which will be useful is as follows The
Farmers Bulletins of the Department of Agriculture are brief popular
articles which give in simple concise language the results of
investigations and experiments They also outline methods for farm
procedure and offer instructions and suggestions for the practical
farmer The annual edition of these bulletins is over six and one half
million copies By law eighty per cent of these are placed at the
disposal of the members of Congress the remaining twenty per cent
being in the hands of the Secretary of Agriculture Libraries will be
placed on the mailing list or single copies will be sent on
application to a senator representative or delegate or to the
secretary of the department An Index to Farmers Bulletins 1250 was
issued as Bulletin 8 of the Division of Publications Department of
Agriculture Circular No 4 of this Division is a Farmers Bulletin
Subject Index and contains a list of the subjects of the Bulletins
arranged alphabetically It is revised at frequent intervals The
Library of Congress issues printed cards for the Farmers Bulletins
The Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture is virtually an annual
encyclopedia of popular timely articles on special topics covering the
years work of the Department and the years progress in agriculture
The law provides for an edition of 500000 copies but under the new
system of public printing the actual number issued is 300000 The
Department has 30000 and the remainder is placed at the order of the
members of Congress Applications to either source will be filled but
requests had better be sent to the congressmen first Two indexes to
the Yearbook have been prepared Bulletin 7 Division of
Publications covers the annual volumes for the period 18941900 and
Bulletin 9 of the same Division the years 19011905 Catalog cards
for all the articles can be secured from the Library of Congress

The most useful publication of the Library of Congress in a small
library is the series of bibliographies compiled in the Division of
Bibliography They vary in size from approximately complete
bibliographies to small reading lists on questions of current interest
Inasmuch as they are based on the largest collection of library
materials in the United States the bibliographies give an idea of
existing references and sources which might not be suggested or even
known in smaller institutions Through library loans and the judicious
writing for sources the small library can supply liberal materials for
study from these bibliographies As to the distribution of these
publications the Library of Congress makes this statement With
certain exceptions the publications are not distributed gratis except
to institutions with which the library regularly exchanges At any
event they can be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents for
from ten to fifteen cents The complete list of these bibliographies is
published in the List of Publications Issued Since 1897 by the
Library of Congress
The Daily Consular and Trade Reports are issued from the Bureau of
Manufactures These are a collection of reports made by United States
consuls in all parts of the world on matters of commercial and current
importance such as new inventions crops market possibilities and
commercial relations in general The Bureau will add a library to its
mailing list upon application
The Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Commerce and Labor issue
two serials which are of use in small libraries The Monthly Summary
of Commerce and Finance is the leading statistical publication of the
government It gives a very complete and detailed statistical account
of the foreign commerce of the United States the internal commerce and
the commerce with the noncontiguous possessions The Statistical
Abstract covers in summarized form most of the important subjects in
the wide field of government activity and easily ranks as the most
useful summary of statistics relating to our country that is printed
The edition is limited to twelve thousand copiesthree thousand to the
Senate six thousand to the House and the remainder to the Bureau
Application for both serials can be made directly to the Bureau and
especially for the Monthly Summary
In conclusion the librarian that intends to be alive to his
opportunity with government documents will get the Annual Reports of
the Superintendent of Documents for 1907 and 1908 and commit them to
heart They contain the best explanation of the present plan of
distribution and other problems with these publications that has been
written The library should receive the series of Price Lists and
Leaflets now being issued by the Documents Office The one is
virtually a bibliography of some important subjects which the documents
cover the other is a description of some one document or some class of
more than passing interest Both show what can be purchased and the
price of the publication If the library has not received copies of
Free Lists Nos 1 to 3 they should be sent for They contain a list
of the documents which are offered free of all charge to libraries
Many rare and useful publications can be secured in this way Finally
if possible subscribe for the Monthly Catalog of Public Documents
which keeps the reading public informed as to what is now being
published by the government how and where the publications can be
obtained and the purchase price
