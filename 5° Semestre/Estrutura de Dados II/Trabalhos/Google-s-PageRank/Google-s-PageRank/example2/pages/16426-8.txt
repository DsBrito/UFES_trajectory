his wishes I am bound to withhold The American Museum of Natural
History of New York and the American Geographical Society of New York
contributed each 1000 and it was arranged that I should travel
under the auspices of these two learned institutions Many scientific
societies received me most cordially
The Government in Washington readily furnished me with the official
papers I required The late Mr James G Blaine then Secretary of
State did everything in his power to pave my way in Mexico even
evincing a very strong personal interest in my plans
In the summer of 1890 preparatory to my work I visited the Zuni
Navajo and Moqui Indians and then proceeded to the City of Mexico
in order to get the necessary credentials from that Government I
was received with the utmost courtesy by the President General
Porfirio Diaz who gave me an hours audience at the Palacio Nacional
and also by several members of his cabinet whose appreciation of
the importance and the scientific value of my proposition was truly
gratifying With everything granted that I wanted for the success of
my expeditionfree passage for my baggage through the Custom House
the privilege of a military escort whenever I deemed one desirable
and numerous letters of introduction to prominent persons in Northern
Mexico who were in a position to further my plansI hurried back to
the United States to organise the undertaking My plan was to enter
at some convenient point in the State of Sonora Mexico that great
and mysterious mountain range called the Sierra Madre cross it to
the famous ruins of Casas Grandes in the State of Chihuahua and then
to explore the range southward as extensively as my means would permit
The western Sierra Madre may be considered a continuation of the
Rocky Mountains and stretches through the greater part of Mexico into
Central and South America as a link of the Cordilleras which form a
practically uninterrupted chain from Bering Strait to Cape Horn The
section occupying Northwestern Mexico is called Sierra Madre del
Norte and offers a wide field for scientific exploration To this
day it has never been surveyed
The northernmost portion of the Sierra Madre del Norte has from time
immemorial been under the dominion of the wild Apache tribes whose hand
was against every man and every man against them Not until General
Crook in 1883 reduced these dangerous nomads to submission did
it become possible to make scientific investigations there indeed
small bands of the Men of the Woods were still left and my party
had to be strong enough to cope with any difficulty from them
Inasmuch as my expedition was the first to take advantage of the
comparative security prevailing in that district I thought that
I could best further the aims of Science by associating with me a
staff of scientists and students Professor W Libbey of Princeton
N J took part as the physical geographer bringing with him his
laboratory man Mr A M Stephen was the archologist assisted
by Mr R Abbott Messrs C V Hartman and C E Lloyd were the
botanists Mr F Robinette the zoological collector and Mr H White
the mineralogist of the expedition
All the scientific men were provided with riding animals while the
Mexican muleteers generally rode their own mounts Our outfit was
as complete as it well could be comprising all the instruments
and tools that might be required besides tents and an adequate
allotment of provisions etc All this baggage had to be transported
on muleback We were all in all thirty men counting the scientific
corps the guides the cooks and the muleteers and we had with us
nearly a hundred animalsmules donkeys and horsesas we crossed
the sierra
It was a winter campaign and from Nacori in Sonora to Casas
Grandes in Chihuahua we were to make our own trail which we did
successfully Ancient remains were almost as rare as in the rest of
the Sierra Madre del Norte yet traces of ancient habitations were
found in the shape of stone terraces which had evidently served
agricultural purposes and at some places rude fortifications were
seen In the eastern part we came upon a considerable number of
caves containing house Croups the builders of which generally
rested in separate burialcaves In the same locality as well as
in the adjacent plains of San Diego Chihuahua we found numerous
mounds covering house groups similar in construction to those in the
caves From underneath their floors we unearthed about five hundred
beautifully decorated pieces of pottery
Among the further results of the expedition may be mentioned the
gathering of large collections of plants among them twentyseven
species new to science fiftyfive mammals among which the siurus
Apache was new to science and about a thousand birds A complete
record was made of meteorological observations
Thus far although the question regarding surviving cliffdwellers was
answered negatively the field southward in the sierra was so promising
that I was eager to extend my explorations in that direction The
funds of the expedition however began to run low and in April
1891 I had to return to the United States to obtain more money with
which to carry on a work that had opened so auspiciously I left
my camp in San Diego in charge of one of my assistants instructing
him to go on with the excavations during my absence This work was
never interrupted though the force of men was now considerably
reduced The law prohibiting excavations without the special permit
of the Government of Mexico had not yet been promulgated
I was so absolutely confident of the ultimate success of my efforts
in spite of discouragements that I twice crossed the entire continent
of North America went down to the City of Mexico and came north
againa journey of over 20000 milesseeing prominent people and
lecturing to arouse a public interest Finally the American Museum
of Natural History of New York decided to continue the explorations
the funds being this time supplied mainly through the munificence
of the late Mr Henry Villard and toward the end of that year I was
able to return to my camp and in January 1892 lead the expedition
further south My scientific assistants were now Mr C V Hartman
botanist Mr C H Taylor civil engineer and photographer and
Mr A E Meade mineralogist and zoological collector
This time we came upon CaveDwellers The Tarahumare Indians of
the Sierra Madre one of the least known among the Mexican tribes
live in caves to such an extent that they may properly be termed
the American CaveDwellers of today I determined to study these
interesting people especially the socalled gentiles 1 pagans
and as this was not practical even with the present reduced size of
the expedition I gradually disbanded the entire company and at last
remained alone
By selling most of my animals and a large part of my outfit and
through the untiring efforts of two American ladies whose friendship
I highly esteem I was enabled to continue my researches alone until
August 1893 when I took my Tarahumare and Tepehuane collections to
Chicago and exhibited them at the Worlds Fair Extensive vocabularies
of the Tarahumare and Tepehuane languages as well as a vocabulary
of the now almost extinct Tubares were among the results of this
expedition besides anthropological measurements samples of hair
and osseous remains
The great possibilities Mexico offers to ethnology proved an
irresistible incentive to new researches and seeing the results
of my previous expeditions the American Museum of Natural History
of New York again sent me out on what was to be my third and most
extensive Mexican expedition which lasted from March 1894 to
March 1897 During these three years I again travelled alone that
is without any scientific assistants at first with two or three
Mexicans Soon however I found that my best companions were the
socalled civilised Indians or even Indians in their aboriginal state
who not only helped me by their mere presence to win the confidence
of their tribesmen but also served me as subjects of observation As
before I stopped for months with a tribe discharging all alien
attendants and roughing it with the Indians In this way I spent
in all a year and a half among the Tarahumares and ten months among
the Coras and Huichols At first the natives persistently opposed me
they are very distrustful of the white man and no wonder since he
has left them little yet to lose But I managed to make my entry and
gradually to gain their confidence and friendship mainly through my
ability to sing their native songs and by always treating them justly
Thus I gained a knowledge of these peoples which could have been
procured in no other way When after five or six months of such
sojourns and travel my stock of civilised provisions would give out
I subsisted on what I could procure from the Indians Game is hard
to get in Mexico and ones larder cannot depend on ones gun As
in Australia my favourite drink was hot water with honey which
besides being refreshing gave a relish to a monotonous diet
All along my route I gathered highly valuable material from the
Tarahumares the Northern and the Southern Tepehuanes the Coras
the Huichols and the Tepecanos all of which tribes except the last
named dwell within the Sierra Madre del Norte also from the Nahuas on
the western slopes of the sierra as well as from those in the States
of Jalisco and Mexico and finally from the Tarascos in the State
of Michoacan Of most of these tribes little more than their names
were known and I brought back large collections illustrating their
ethnical and anthropological status besides extensive information
in regard to their customs religion traditions and myths I also
completed my collection of vocabularies and aboriginal melodies On
my journey through the Tierra Caliente of the Territory of Tepic
and the States of Jalisco and Michoacan I also obtained a number of
archaeological objects of great historical value and importance
In 1898 I made my last expedition to Mexico under the same auspices
staying there for four months On this trip I was accompanied by
Dr Ales Hrdlicka I revisited the Tarahumares and Huichols in order
to supplement the material in hand and to settle doubtful points that
had come up in working out my notes Sixty melodies from these tribes
were recorded on the graphophone
Thus from 1890 to 1898 I spent fully five years in field researches
among the natives of northwestern Mexico The material was collected
with a view to shedding light upon the relations between the ancient
culture of the valley of Mexico and the Pueblo Indians in the southwest
of the United States to give an insight into the ethnical status
of the Mexican Indians now and at the time of the conquest and to
illuminate certain phases in the development of the human race
So far the results of my expeditions to Mexico have been made public

Memoir of the American Museum of Natural History
The present volumes give a succinct account of my travels and
work among the remote peoples of the Sierra Madre del Norte and
the countries adjacent to the south and east as far as the City of
Mexico Most of what I tell here refers to a part of the Republic
that is never visited by tourists and is foreign even to most
Mexicans Primitive people are becoming scarce on the globe On the
American continents there are still some left in their original
state If they are studied before they too have lost their
individuality or been crushed under the heels of civilisation much
light may be thrown not only upon the early people of this country
but upon the first chapters of the history of mankind
In the present rapid development of Mexico it cannot be prevented that
these primitive people will soon disappear by fusion with the great
nation to whom they belong The vast and magnificent virgin forests
and the mineral wealth of the mountains will not much longer remain
the exclusive property of my dusky friends but I hope that I shall
have rendered them a service by setting them this modest monument
and that civilised man will be the better for knowing of them
That I have been able to accomplish what I did I owe in the
first place to the generosity of the people of the United States
to their impartiality and freedom from prejudice which enables
foreigners to work shoulder to shoulder with their own advance
guard I wish to extend my thanks in particular to the American
Geographical Society of New York and still more especially to
the American Museum of Natural History of New York with whom I
have had the honour of being connected more or less closely for ten
years To its publicspirited and wholesouled President Mr Morris
K Jesup I am under profound obligations I also take pleasure in
acknowledging my indebtedness to Mr Andrew Carnegie who initiated
my Mexican ventures with a subscription of 1000 furthermore to the

Curators of the American Museum of Natural History
I am under obligation to Mr Marshall H Saville Curator of the
American Museum of Natural History especially for the placing of
the names of the ruins of Southern Mexico on one of the maps to
Miss Alice Fletcher of Washington D C and Mr Edwin S Tracy for
transcribing from the graphophone three of the songs rendered in this
book and to Mrs George S Bixby for aid in transcribing the native
music Finally I desire to express my appreciation of the untiring
services of my private secretary Mrs H E Hepner
The upper illustration on page 65 is a reproduction of a photograph
kindly furnished me by Mr Frank H Chapman and the illustration in
Vol I pages 145146 is made from a photograph acquired through
the late Dr P Lamborn The illustration in Vol II pages 464465
I owe to the courtesy of Mr D Gabriel Castanos of Guadalajara
The coloured illustrations are represented as the objects appear when
the colours have been brought out by the application of water
The maps do not lay claim to an accuracy which under the
circumstances it was impossible to obtain but they will I hope
be found to be an improvement on the existing ones
Dr Ales Hrdlicka who has just returned from the Hyde expedition
informs me that in visiting the western part of Sonora he found pure
Opata spoken west of Rio de Sonora and north of Ures eg in Tuape
Wherever dollars and cents are given Mexican currency is meant
In the Indian Songs II 10 and 18 I have made an attempt at rendering
the native words in English in such a form that the translations
could be sung without however deviating from the original
In the native words x should be given the sound of the Greek chi
