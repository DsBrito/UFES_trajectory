He moved slowly fanning himself absently with his white straw hat
pausing from time to time to exchange a word of greetingsecure in the
affability of one who is not only a judge of man but a Bassett of
Virginia From his classic head to his illfitting boots he upheld the
traditions of his office and his race
On the stone platform just beyond the entrance he stopped to speak to
a lawyer from a neighbouring county Then as a clump of men scattered
at his approach he waved them together with a bland benedictory
gesture which descended alike upon the high and the low upon the rector
of the old church up the street in his rusty black and upon the
redhaired rawboned farmer with his streaming brow
Glad to see you out sir he said to the one and to the other How
are you Burr Time the crops were in the ground isnt it
Burr mumbled a confused reply wiping his neck laboriously on his red
cotton handkerchief
The corns been planted goin on six weeks he said more distinctly
ejecting his words between mouthfuls of tobacco juice as if they were
pebbles which obstructed his speech I alays stick to plantin yo
corn when the hickory leafs as big as a squirrels ear If you dont
the lucks agin you
An whar thars growin corn thars a sight o hoein put in an
alert nervouslooking countryman If I lay my hoe down for a spell
the weeds git so big I cant find the crop
Amos Burr nodded with slow emphasis I never see land take so natural
to weeds nohow as mine do he said When you raise peanuts youre
raisin trouble
He was a lean overworked man with knotted hands the colour of the
soil he tilled and an inanely honest face over which the freckles
showed like splashes of mud freshly dried As he spoke he gave his blue
jean trousers an abrupt hitch at the belt
Dear me Dear me returned the judge with absentminded habitual
friendliness smiling his rich beneficent smile Then as he caught
sight of a smaller red head beneath Burrs arm he added Youve a
righthand man coming on I see Whats your name my boy
The boy squirmed on his bare brown feet and wriggled his head from
beneath his fathers arm He did not answer but he turned his bright
eyes on the judge and flushed through all the freckles of his ugly
little face
Nickthat is Nicholas sir replied the elder Burr with an
apologetic cough due to the insignificance of the subject Yes sir
hes leetle but hes plum full of grit He can beat any nigger I ever
seed at the plough Hed outplough me if he war a head taller
That will mend remarked the lawyer from the neighbouring county with
facetious intention A boy and a beanstalk will grow you know Theres
no helping it
Oh hell be a man soon enough added the judge his gaze passing over
the large red head to rest upon the small one and a farmer like his
father before him I suppose
He was turning away when the childs voice checked him and he paused
IId ruther be a judge said the boy
He was leaning against the faded bricks of the old courthouse one
sunburned hand playing nervously with the crumbling particles His
honest little face was as red as his hair
The judge started
Ah he exclaimed and he looked at the child with his kindly eyes The
boy was ugly lean and stunted in growth browned by hot suns and
powdered by the dust of country roads but his eyes caught the gaze of
the judge and held it
Above his head on the brick wall a board was nailed bearing in black
marking the name of the whitesand street which stretched like a
chalkdrawn line from the grassgrown battlefields to the pale old
buildings of Kings College The street had been called in honour of a
duke of Gloucester It was now Main Street and nothing more though
it was still wide and white and placidly impressed by the slow passage
of Kingsborough feet Beyond the courthouse the breeze blew across the
green which was ablaze with buttercups Beneath the warm wind the
yellow heads assumed the effect of a brilliant tangle spreading over
the unploughed common running astray in the grasslined ditch that
bordered the walk hiding beneath dustyleaved plants in unsuspected
hollows and breaking out again under the horses hoofs in the sandy
street
Ah exclaimed the judge and a goodnatured laugh ran round the group
Wall I never ejaculated the elder Burr but there was no surprise in
his tone it expressed rather the helplessness of paternity
The boy faced them pressing more firmly against the bricks
There aint nothin in peanutraisin he said Its jest farmin fur
crows Id ruther be a judge
The judge laughed and turned from him
Stick to the soil my boy he advised Stick to the soil It is the
best thing to do But if you choose the second best and I can help you
I willI will upon my wordAh General to a jovialfaced
widegirthed gentleman in a brown linen coat Im glad to see you in
town Fine weather
He put on his hat bowed again and went on his way
He passed slowly along in the spring sunshine his feet crunching upon
the gravel his straight shadow falling upon the white level between
coarse fringes of wiregrass Far up the town at the streets sudden
end where it was lost in diverging roads there was visible as through
a film of bluish smoke the verdigrisgreen foliage of Kings College
Nearer at hand the solemn cruciform of the old church was steeped in
shade the high belltower dropping a veil of English ivy as it rose
against the sky Through the rusty iron gate of the graveyard the marble
slabs glimmered beneath submerging grasses long pale tremulous like
reeds
The grassgrown walk beside the low brick wall of the churchyard led on
to the judges own garden a square enclosure laid out in straight
vegetable rows marked off by variegated borders of flowering
plantsheartsease foxglove and the redlidded eyes of scarlet
poppies Beyond the feathery green of the asparagus bed there was a bush
of flowering syringa another at the beginning of the grasstrimmed
walk and yet another brushing the large white pillars of the square
front porchtheir slender sprays blown from sun to shade like
fluttering streamers of creamcoloured ribbons On the other side there
were lilacs stately and leafy and bare of bloom save for a few
ashenhued bunches lingering late amid the heavy foliage At the foot of
the garden the wall was hidden in raspberry vines weighty with ripening
fruit
The judge closed the gate after him and ascended the steps It was not
until he had crossed the wide hall and opened the door of his study that
he heard the patter of bare feet and turned to find that the boy had
followed him
For an instant he regarded the child blankly then his hospitality
asserted itself and he waved him courteously into the room
Walk in walk in and take a seat I am at your service
He crossed to one of the tall windows unfastening the heavy inside
shutters from which the white paint was fast peeling away As they fell
back a breeze filled the room and the ivory faces of microphylla roses
stared across the deep windowseat The place was airy as a summerhouse
and odorous with the essence of roses distilled in the sunshine beyond
On the high plastered walls above the bookshelves rows of bygone
Bassetts looked down on their departed possessionsstately and severe
in the artificial severity of periwigs and starched ruffles They looked
down with immobile eyes and the placid monotony of past fashions
smiling always the same smile staring always at the same spot of floor
or furniture
Below them the room was still hallowed by their touch They asserted
themselves in the quaint curves of the rosewood chairs in the blue
patterns upon the willow bowls and in the choice lavender of the old
Wedgwood Their handiwork was visible in the laborious embroideries of
the firescreen near the empty grate and the spinet in one unlighted
corner still guarded their gay and amiable airs
Sit down said the judge I am at your service
He seated himself before his desk of handcarved mahogany pushing aside
the papers that littered its baizecovered lid In the halfgloom of the
highceiled room his face assumed the look of a portrait in oils and he
seemed to have descended from his allotted square upon the plastered
wall to be but a boldly limned composite likeness of his race awaiting
the last touches and the gilded frame
What can I do for you he asked again his tone preserving its
unfailing courtesy He had not made an uncivil remark since the close of
the wara line of conduct resulting less from what he felt to be due to
others than from what he believed to be becoming in himself
The boy shifted on his bare feet In the oldtimed setting of the
furniture he was an alienan anachronismthe intrusion of the
hopelessly modern into the helplessly past His hair made a rich spot in
the colourless atmosphere and it seemed to focus the incoming light
from the unshuttered window leaving the background in denser shadow
The animation of his features jarred the serenity of the room His
profile showed gnomelike against the nodding heads of the microphylla
roses
There aint nothin in peanutraisin he said suddenly IId
ruther be a judge
My dear boy exclaimed the judge and finished helplessly my dear
boyIwellI
They were both silent The regular droning of the old clock sounded
distinctly in the stillness The perfume of roses mingling with the
musty scent from the furniture borrowed the quality of musk
The child was breathing heavily Suddenly he dug the dirty knuckles of
one fist into his eyes
Dont cry began the judge Please dont Perhaps you would like to
run out and play with my boy Tom
I warnt cryin said the child It war a gnat
His hand left his eyes and returned to his hata widebrimmed harvest
hat with a shoestring tied tightly round the crown
When the judge spoke again it was with seriousness
Nicholasyour name is Nicholas isnt it
Yes sir
How old are you
Twelve sir
Can you read
Yes sir
Write
Yes sir
Spell
The child hesitated II can spellsome
Dont you know it is a serious thing to be a judge
Yes sir
You must be a lawyer first
Yes sir
It is hard work
Yes sir
And sometimes its no better than farming for crows
The boy shook his head Its cleaner work sir
The judge laughed
Im afraid you are obstinate Nicholas he said and added Now what
do you want me to do for you I cant make you a judge It took me fifty
years to make myself onea thirdrate one at that
IId like to take a bobook stammered the boy
Dear me said the judge irritably dear me
He frowned his gaze skimming his wellfilled shelves He regretted
suddenly that he had spoken to the child at the courthouse He would
never be guilty of such an indiscretion again Of what could he have
been thinking A book Why didnt he ask for foodmoneyhis best piece
of fluted Royal Worcester
Then a loud boyish laugh rang in from the garden and his face softened
suddenly In the sunscorched honesteyed little figure before him he
saw his own boythe single child of his young wife who was lying
beneath a marble slab in the churchyard Her face mild and
Madonnalike glimmered against the pallid rose leaves in the deep
windowseat
He turned hastily away
Yes yes he answered I will lend you one Read the titles
carefully Dont let the books fall Never lay them face downwardsand
dont turn down the leaves
The boy advanced timidly to the shelves between the southern windows He
ran his hands slowly along the lettered backs his lips moving as he
spelled out the names
The Federalist Blackstones
Commentaries Revised Statutes of the United
States
The judge drew up to his desk and looked over his letters Then he took
up his pen and wrote several replies in his fine flowing handwriting
He had forgotten the boy when he felt a touch upon his arm
What is it he asked absently Ah it is you Yes let me see Why
youve got Sir Henry Maine
The boy was holding the book in both hands As the judge laughed he
flushed nervously and turned towards the door
The judge leaned back in his chair watching the small figure cross the
room and disappear into the hall He saw the tracks of dust which the
boys feet left upon the smooth bare floor but he was not thinking of
them Then as the child went out upon the porch he started up
Nicholas he called dont turn down the leaves
II
A facetious stranger once remarked that Kingsborough dozed through the
present to dream of the past and found the future a nightmare Had he
been other than a stranger he would perhaps have added that
Kingsboroughs proudest boast was that she had been and was nota
distinction giving her preeminence over certain cities whose charters
were not received from royal grantscities priding themselves not only
upon a multiplicity of streets but upon the more plebeian fact that the
feet of their young men followed the offending thoroughfares to the
undignified music of the march of progress
But whatever might be said of places that shall be nameless it was
otherwise with Kingsborough Kingsborough was the same yesterday
today and forever She who had feasted royal governors staked and
lost upon Colonial races and exploded like an ignited powderhorn in
the cause of American independence was still superbly conscious of the
honours which had been hers Her governors were no longer royal nor did
she feast them her races were run by fleetfooted coloured urchins on
the courthouse green her powdermagazine had evolved through
differentiation from a stable into a church but Kingsborough clung to
her amiable habits Travellers still arrived at the landing stage some
several miles distant and were driven over all but impassable roads to
the town The eastern wall of the courthouse still bore the sign
England Street though the street had vanished beneath encroaching
buttercups and the implied loyalty had been found wanting Kingsborough
juries still sat in their original semicircle with their backs to the
judge and their faces presumably to the law Kingsborough farmers
still marketed their small truck in the street called after the Duke of
Gloucester and Kingsborough cows still roamed at will over the vaults
in the churchyard In time trivial changes would come to pass Tourists
would arrive with the railroad the powdermagazine would turn from a
church into a museum gardens would decay and ancient elms would fall
but the farmers and the cows would not be missed from their accustomed
haunts On the hospitable thresholds of general stores battlescarred
veterans of the war between the States dealt in victorious reminiscences
of vanquishment They had fought well they had fallen silently and
they had risen without bitterness For the people of Kingsborough had
opened their doors to wounded foes while the battle raged through their
streets succouring while they resisted They lived easily and they died
hard but when death came they met it not in grim Puritanism but with
a laugh upon the lips They made a joy of life while it was possible
and when that ceased to be they did the next best thing and made a
friend of death Long ago theirs had been the first part in Virginia
and as they still believed theirs had been also the centre of all
things Now the high places were laid low and the greatness had passed
as a trumpet that is blown Kingsborough persisted still but it
persisted evasively hovering as it were upon the outskirts of modern
advancement And the outside world took note only when it made tours to
historic strongholds or sent those of itself that were adjudged insane
to the hospitable shelter of the asylum upon the hill
It was afternoon and Kingsborough was asleep
Along the verdurous gray lanes the houses seemed abandoned shuttered
filled with shade From the courthouse green came the chime of
cowbells rising and falling in slow waves of sound A spotted calf
stood bleating in the crooked footpath which traversed diagonally the
waste of buttercups like a white seam in a cloth of gold Against the
arching sky rose the belltower of the grim old church where the
sparrows twittered in the melancholy gables and the startled face of the
stationary clock stared blankly above the ivied walls Farther away at
the end of a wavering lane slanted the shadow of the insane asylum
Across the green the houses were set in surrounding gardens like cards
in bouquets of mixed blossoms They were of frame for the most part
with shingled roofs and small square windows hidden beneath climbing
roses On one of the long verandas a sleeping girl lay in a hammock a
gray cat at her feet No sound came from the house behind her but a
breeze blew through the dim hall fluttering the folds of her dress
Beyond the adjoining garden a lady in mourning entered a gate where
honeysuckle grew and above on the lowdormered roof a white pigeon
sat preening its feathers Up the main street where a few sunken bricks
of a vanished pavement were still visible an old negro woman sitting
on the stone before her cabin lighted her replenished pipe with a
taper and leaned back smoking in the doorway her scarlet
handkerchief making a spot of colour on the dull background
The sun was still high when the judge came out upon his porch a smile
of indecision on his face and his hat in his hand Pausing upon the
topmost step he cast an uncertain glance sideways at the walk leading
past the church and then looked straight ahead through the avenue of
maples which began at the smaller green facing the ancient site of the
governors palace and skirted the length of the larger one which took
its name from the courthouse At last he descended the steps with his
leisurely tread turning at the gate to throw a remonstrance to an old
negro whose black face was framed in the library window
Now Csar didnt I
Lord Marse George dis yer washedout blue bowl wid de little white
critters sprawlin over it done come ter pieces
Now Csar havent I told you twenty times to let Delilah wash my
Wedgwood
Fo de Lord Marse George I aint breck hit I uz des holn it in
bofe my hans same es Ise holn dis yer broom wen it come right ter
part I declar twarn my fault Marse George twarn nobodys fault
cepn hits own
The judge closed the gate and waved the face from the window
Go about your business Csar he said and keep your hands off my
china
Then his tone lost its asperity as he held out his hands to a pretty
girl who was coming across the green
So you are back from school Miss Juliet he said gallantly I was
telling your mother only yesterday that I didnt approve of sending our
fairest products away from Kingsborough It wasnt done in my day Then
the prettiest girls stayed at home and gave our young fellows a chance
The girl shook her head until the blue ribbons on her straw hat
fluttered in the wind and blushed until her soft eyes were like
forgetmenots set in rose leaves She possessed a serene luminous
beauty which became intensified beneath the gaze of the beholder
I have come back for good now she answered in a serious sweetness of
voice and I am out this afternoon looking up my Sundayschool class
The children have scattered sadly You will let me have Tom again wont
you
Have Tom Why you may have him every day and Sunday toothe lucky
scamp Ah I only wish I were a boy again with a soul worth saving and
such a pair of eyes in search of it
The girl dimpled into a smile and flushed to her low white forehead on
which the soft hair was smoothly parted before it broke into sunny curls
about the temples She exhaled an atmosphere of gentleness mixed with a
saintly coquetry which produced an impression at once human and divine
such as one receives from the sight of a rose in a Bible or a curl in
the hair of a saint The judge looked at her warmly sighing half
happily half regretfully
And to think that the young rogues dont realise their blessings he
said Theres not one of them that wouldnt rather be off fishing than
learn his catechism Ah in my day things were differentthings were
different
Were you very pious sir asked the girl with a flash of laughter
The judge shook his stick playfully
I cant tell tales he answered but in my day we should have taken
more than the catechism at your bidding my dear When your father was
courting your motherand she was like you though she hadnt your eyes
or your face for that matterhe went into her Bible class though he
was at least five and twenty and the others were small boys under ten
She was a sad flirt and she led him a dance
He liked it said the girl But if you will give my message to Tom
I wont come in I am looking for Dudley Webb and I see his mother at
her gate Goodbye Be sure and tell Tom to come Sunday
She nodded brightly lifted her muslin skirts and recrossed the street
The judge watched her until the flutter of her white dress vanished down
the lane of maples then he turned to speak to the occupants of a
carriage that had drawn up to the sidewalk
The vehicle was of an oldfashioned make bare of varnish with rickety
mudsplashed wheels and rusty springs It was drawn by an illmatched
pair of horses and driven by a lame coloured boy who carried a peeled
hickory branch for a whip
Ah General Battle said the judge to a stout gentleman with a red
face and an expansive shirt front from which the collar had wilted away
fine afternoon Is that Eugenia to a little girl of seven or eight
years with a puppy of the pointer breed in her arms and How are you
Sampson to the coloured driver
The three greeted him simultaneously whereupon he leaned forward
resting his hand upon the side of the carriage
The young folks are growing up he said I have just seen Juliet
Burwell and on my life she gets prettier every day We shant keep
her long
Keep her replied the general vigorously wiping his large face with a
large pocket handkerchief Keep her If I were thirty years younger
you shouldnt keep her a daynot a day sir
The little girl looked up gravely from the corner of the seat tossing
her short dark plait from her shoulder What would you do with her
papa she asked Weve got no place to put her at home
The general threw back his great head and laughed till his wide girth
shook like a bag of meal
Oh you neednt worry Eugie he said Im not the man I used to be
She wouldnt look at me Bless your heart she wouldnt look at me if I
asked her
Eugenia clasped her puppy closer and turned her eyes upon her fathers
jovial face
I dont see how she could help it if you stood in front of her she
answered gravely in a voice rich with the blending of negro
intonations
The general shook again until the carriage creaked on its rusty
springs and the coloured boy Sampson let the reins fall and joined in
the hilarity
She wont let me so much as look at a girl exclaimed the general
delightedly stooping to recover the brown linen lap robe which had
slipped from his knees Shes as jealous as if I were twenty and had a
score of sweethearts
The little girl did not reply but she flushed angrily Dont
precious she said to the puppy who was licking her cheek with his
warm red tongue
What have you named him Eugie asked the judge changing the subject
with that gracious tact which was mindful of the least emergency He is
nicely marked I see
I call him Jim replied Eugenia She spoke gravely and the gravity
contrasted oddly with the animation of her features But his real name
is James Burwell Battle Bernard and I christened him in the
springhouseso hell go to heaven
Capn Burwell gave him to her you know explained the general who
laughed whenever his daughter spoke as if the fact of her talking at
all was a source of amazement to him and she hasnt let go of him
since she got him By the way Judge you have a firstrate garden spot
I hear your asparagus is the finest in town Ours is very poor this
year I must have a new bed made before next season Ah what is it
daughter
Youve forgotten to buy the sugar said Eugenia and Aunt Chris cant
put up her preserves And you told me to remind you of the whip
Bless your heart so I did Sampson lost that whip a month ago and
Ive never remembered it yet Well gooddaygoodday
The judge raised his hat with a stately inclination the general nodded
goodnaturedly still grasping the linen robe with his plump red hand
and the carriage jolted along the green and disappeared behind the
glazed brick walls of the church
The judge regarded his walkingstick meditatively for a moment and
continued his way The smile with which he had followed the vanishing
figure of Juliet Burwell returned to his face and his features softened
from their usual chilly serenity
He had gone but a short distance and was passing the iron gate of the
churchyard when the droning of a voice came to him and looking beyond
the bars he saw little Nicholas Burr lying at full length upon a marble
slab his head in his hands and his feet waving in the air
Entering the gate the judge followed the walk of mossgrown stones
leading to the church steps and paused within hearing of the voice
which went on in an abstracted drawl
The most celebrated system of jurisprudence known to the world
begins as it ends with a code He was not reading for the book was
closed He seemed rather to be repeating over and over again words which
had been committed to memory
With a code From the commencement to the close of its history the
expositors of Roman Law consistently employed language which
implied that the body of their system rested on the twelve
Decemviral TablesDecemviralDecemviral Tables
Bless my soul said the judge The boy glanced up blushed and would
have risen but the judge waved him back
Nono dont get up I heard you as I was going by What are you
doing
Learnin
Learning Dear me What do you mean by learning
Im learnin by heart sirandand if you dont mind sir what does
jurisprudence mean
The judge started returning the boys eager gaze with one of kindly
perplexity
Bless my soul he said again You arent trying to understand that
are you
The boy grew scarlet and his lips trembled No sir he answered Im
jest learnin it now Ill know what it means when Im bigger
And you expect to remember it asked the judge
I dont never forget said the boy
Bless my soul exclaimed the judge for the third time
For a moment he stood looking silently down upon the marble slab with
its defaced lettering Of the wordy epitaph which had once redounded to
the honour of the bones beneath there remained only the words who
departed but he read these with a long abstracted gaze
Let me see he said at last speaking with his accustomed dignity
Did you ever go to school Nicholas
Yes sir
When
I went most three winters sir but I had to leave off on ocount o
pas not havin any hand cepn me
The judge smiled
Ah well he returned Well see if you cant begin again My boy has
a tutor you know and his playmates come to study with him Hes about
your age and it will give you a start Come in tomorrow at nine and
well talk it over No dont get up I am going
And he passed out of the churchyard closing the heavy gate with a
metallic clang Nicholas lay on the marble slab but the book slipped
from his hands and he gazed straight before him at the oriel window
where the ivy was tremulous with the shining bodies and clamorous voices
of nesting sparrows They darted swiftly from gable to gable filling
the air with shrill sounds of discord and endowing with animation the
inanimate pile wrapping the dead bricks in a living shroud
On the other side swept the long colourless grasses rippling in faint
waves like a still lake that reflects the sunshine and swaying lightly
beneath myriads of gauzywinged bees that flashed with a droning noise
from blade to blade to find rest in the yellow hearts of the damask
roses Across the white vaults and the lowlying marble slabs
innumerable shadows chased and from above the gnarled old locust trees
swept a fringe of vivid green the slender blossoms hanging in tassels
from the branches ends and filling the air with a soft and ceaseless
rain of fragrant petals Pale as the ghosts of dead leaves they fell
always fluttering night and day from the twisted boughs settling in
creamy flakes upon the bending grasses and outlining in delicate
tracery the epitaphs upon the discoloured marbles
Nicholas lay with wideopen eyes looking up at the oriel window where
the sparrows twittered On a near vault a catbird poised for an instant
surveying him with bright distrustful eyes Then with an impetuous
flutter of slategray wings it fled to the poisonous oak on the far
brick wall A redandwhite cow passing along the lane outside stopped
before the closed gate and stood philosophically chewing the cud as she
looked within through impeding bars From the judges garden came the
faint sound of a negro voice as the old gardener weeded the vegetables
Nicholas rolled over again and faced the outstretched wings of the
noseless angel on the nearest tombstone The loss of the nose had
