been committed to writing by the authors for instance of the beautiful
sermon of Mr ARTHUR not a word was written by him either before or
since its delivery
This will account for the fact that the subjects are not treated with any
degree of scientific exactness as essays might require but in a manner
intended to suggest useful thoughts to serious audiences
Although myself of the Church of England I have had many opportunities
during the past thirtyfive years of hearing discourses from Wesleyan
ministers and making personal acquaintance with them and I believe the
following Sermons are a fair specimen of the Wesleyan teaching in this
country
Why should not the Church of England and the great Wesleyan body be
united  Circumstances are entirely altered since Wesley and his
coadjutors were compelled to run away from the Church of England  Now
thank God the majority of our clergy like the Wesleyan ministers are
zealous and energetic and evangelical men popular in the style of
their addresses distinguished by the vigour of their pastoral
ministrations and incessant in them paternal in their care of the poor
of broad and social Christian sympathies and earnestly pursuing the
secular and religious education of the young  Why should not the priests
of the Church of England and the ordained Wesleyan ministers be permitted
to exchange pulpits as they may think fit  There is little danger that a
Wesleyan minister would proclaim unsound doctrine  Such an evil is much
more shortly and sharply rectified by Wesleyan discipline which the
Courts of Law uphold than by any mere legal action to which the Church
of England is bound
May it please God by His Holy Spirit to make these Sermons effectual
for the spreading of His truth and the quickening of His people

THE LIVELY STONES
REV W MORLEY PUNSHON
Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy
priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by
Jesus Christ1 PETER ii 5
There is a manifest reference in the fourth verse to the personage
alluded to in Psalm cxviii 22 23 The stone which the builders refused
is become the head stone of the corner  This is the Lords doing it is
marvellous in our eyes  And this passage is applied by Christ to
himself in Matthew xxi 42 Jesus saith unto them Did ye never read in
the scriptures The stone which the builders rejected the same is become
the head of the corner this is the Lords doing and it is marvellous in
our eyes  The Apostle therefore places the beginning of any connection
with Christianity in coming to Christ and assures believers that in
their union with Him alone consists the fulness of their dignity and
privilege  And there is no truth that will more readily be acknowledged
or receive a heartier acquiescence from the heart of a believer  What
could we do without Jesus  In our every necessity He is our refuge and
strength in our perils He compasses us about with songs of deliverance
his life is our perfect example his death is our perfect atonement
Well might the Apostle interrupt the course of his argument with the
grateful apostrophe Unto you therefore which believe He is
precious and exhort them that ye should show forth the praises of Him
who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light  The text
presents us with topics of meditation worthy of our prayerful study as
it reveals to us
ITHE CHARACTER
IITHE PRIVILEGE
IIITHE DUTY OF BELIEVERS
I  You observe that in the text believers are presented as a spiritual
house and a holy priesthood two different illustrations which if you
translate the word here rendered house by the more sacred word
temple will be found to have the same religious significance and a
close connection with each other  Coming to Christ as the
foundationstone of the building disallowed indeed of men but chosen
of God and precious the Church rises into a spiritual temple  From
Christ the great High Priest consecrated after no carnal commandment
believers rise into a holy priesthood by a majestic investiture that is
higher than the ordination of Aaron  There are two points in the
character of the ransomed Church which are illustrated in these
wordsspirituality and holiness
Take the first thought spirituality  They are lively or living stones
built up into a spiritual house  Any one who thoughtfully observes the
successive ages of the worlds history will not fail to discover that
each generation of men has in some important particulars progressed upon
its predecessor  There has been not only an accumulation of the
treasures of thought and knowledge but an increase of the capacity to
produce them  Hence in every age there has been a higher appreciation of
freedom a quickened enterprise of enquiry the stream of legislation has
refined and broadened in its flow improvement has extended its acreage
of enclosure and principles proved and gained have become part of the
property of the world  Our nature has had its mental childhood  The
established laws of mind admit only of a gradual communication of
knowledge  It was necessary therefore that men should be first stored
with elementary principles then advanced to axioms and syllables and
afterwards introduced into the fellowship of the mystery of Divine truth
Hence any reflective mind pondering upon the dealings of God with men
will discover a progressive development of revelation adjusted with
careful adaptation to the preparedness of different ages of mankind  In
the first ages God spake to men in sensible manifestations in visions of
the night by audible voice in significant symbol  As time advanced the
sensible manifestations became rarer and were reserved for great and
distinguishing occasions  From the lips of a lawgiver in the seers
vision and in the prophets burden of reproof or consolation the Divine
spake and the people heard and trembled  At length in the fulness of
time the appeal to the senses was altogether discarded the age of
spirituality began and in the completed revelation men read as they
shall read for ever the Divine will in the perfected and royal word
And this progress which appears through all creation as an inseparable
condition of the works of God present in everything from the formation
of a crystal to the establishment of an economy is seen also in the
successive dispensations under which man has been brought into connection
with heaven  You can trace through all dispensations the essential unity
of revealed religion  There have never been but two covenants of God
with manthe covenant of works and the covenant of grace never but two
religionsthe religion of innocence and the religion of mercy  Through
all economies there run the same invariable elements of truth  The first
promise contains within itself the germ of all subsequent revelationthe
Abrahamic covenant the separation of Israel all the rites and all the
prophecies are but the unfoldings of its precious meaning  Sacrifice
for the guilty mediation for the faroff and wandering regeneration for
the impure salvation through the merit of another these are the inner
life of the words the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpents
head  The gospel therefore was preached unto Abraham  Moses felt the
potent influence of the reproach of Christ  David describeth the
blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth not iniquity  Of this
salvation the prophets enquired and searched diligently  Christ was the
one name of the worlds constant memory to Him gave all the prophets
witness and from the obscurest to the clearest revelation all testified
in tones which it was difficult to misunderstand  Neither is there
salvation in any other for there is no other name under heaven given
among men whereby we must be saved  The patriarchal dispensation had no
elaborate furniture nor gorgeous ritualism  The father was the priest of
the household and as often as the firstling bled upon the altar it
typified the faith of them all in a better sacrifice to come  Then came
the Jewish dispensation with its array of services and external
splendour with its expressive symbolism and its magnificent temple and
then rising into a higher altitude the fulness of time came and
Christianitythe religion not of the sensuous but of the spiritual not
of the imagination awed by scenes of grandeur nor bewildered by
ceremonies of terror but of the intellect yielding to evidence of the
conscience smitten by truth of the heart taken captive by the
omnipotence of loveappeared for the worship of the world  Our Saviour
in his conversation with the Samaritan woman inaugurated so to speak
the dispensation of the spiritual The hour cometh and now isthere
is the moment of instalment when the great bell of time might have
pealed at once a requiem for the past and a welcome to the grander
future when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth  Requiring spiritual worship it was natural that God should
have built up a spiritual house wherein he should dwell in statelier
presence than in houses made with hands  Hence there is now rising
upon earth its masonry unfinished but advancing day by day a spiritual
temple more magnificent than the temple of Solomon costlier than the
temple of Herod  Destroy this temple said the Saviour to his
wondering listeners and in three days I will raise it up  Forty and
six years was this temple in building and will thou rear it up in three
days  But He spake of the temple of His body  What know ye not
that your bodies are the members of Christ  Yes believers everywhere
are stones in the spiritual house broken perhaps into conformity or
chiselled into beauty by successive strokes of trial and wherever they
are in the hut or in the ancestral hall in the climates of the snow or
of the sun whether society hoot them or honour them whether they wrap
themselves in delicate apparelling or in rugged homespun toil all day
for bread they are parts of the true temple which God esteems higher
than cloistered crypt or stately fane and the top stone of which shall
hereafter be brought on with joy
The second representation of a believers character is holiness a
holy priesthood  In the Jewish dispensation the word was understood
to mean no more than an outward and visible separation unto God the
priests in the temple and the vessels of their ministry were said to be
ceremonially holy  But more is implied in the term as it occurs in the
text and kindred passages than a mere ritual and external sanctity  It
consists in the possession of that mind which was also in Christ Jesus
in the reinstatement in us of that image of God which was lost by the
disobedience of the fall  You will remember numerous scriptures in which
holiness regarded as the supreme devotion of the heart and service to
God is brought out as at once a requirement and a characteristic of a
Christian  What manner of persons ought we to be in all holy
conversation and godliness  Be ye holy for I am holy as He which
hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation
God hath not called us to uncleanness but unto holiness  Having these
promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of
the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God  And it is
absolutely necessary that this grace should be cultivated if we would
either fulfil the mission of our priesthood or abide in the Divine
presence for ever  Holiness is requisite whether to see the Lord or to
walk before men unto all wellpleasing and as living witnesses
transcripts of His holiness enabled by his grace to maintain purity of
heart and life God has promised to establish those who put their trust
in Him  Some Christians have been deterred from the search after this
blessing of heaven by the mistakes of those who have endeavoured to
expound it or by the hypocrisy of those who have assumed its profession
that they might the better sin  It is marvellous how many different
views of it have at times obtained currency in the world  By some it has
been resolved into a sort of refined Hinduism a state in which the soul
is unearthed entranced beatified by devout contemplation into a
pietistic rapture others have deemed that the best way to secure it was
a retirement from the vexing world a recreant forsaking of the active
duties of life as if it consisted in immunity from temptation rather
than in victory over it  Others have placed it in surpliced observance
or in monastic vow an equivocal regard to patterns of things in the
heavens which common men mistake for idolatry  Others again reversing
the old Pythagorean maxim and wearing the image of God upon their ring
have expressed it by unworthy familiarity a continual adverting to the
gifts of the spirit and the experience of the soul in the flippancy of
ordinary conversation as did some of the fanatics of the Commonwealth
Others have represented it as a perpetual austerity an investiture of
our family circles with all the hues of the sepulchre and a flinging
upon the face of society the frown of a rebuking fretfulness which would
make the good of an archangel evil spoken of in this censorious world
But the scriptural holiness which believers long for and which the
Church is to spread through the land is not a necessary adjunct of any
or all of these  It is not the acting of a part in a drama but the
forthputting of a character in life the exhibition in harmonious action
of the humble love and filial fear with which men work out their
salvation  A holy priesthood  It is remarkable of this spiritual
priesthood that it descends in no particular succession nor limits its
privileges to any exclusive genealogy  The holiness which is at once its
distinctiveness and its hallowing comprehends and can sanctify all
relations of life  Let the minister have it and the love of Christ his
supremest affection will prompt his loathing of sin and his pity for
sinners will fire his zeal and make his words burn and will often urge
him to cast himself upon the mercyseat that his labours may not be in
vain  Let the merchant or the manufacturer or the man of business have
it and it need neither bate his diligence nor hold him back from riches
but it will smite down his avarice and restrain his greed of gold it
will make him abhor the fraud that is gainful and eschew the speculation
that is hazardous and shrink from the falsehood that is customary and
check the competition that is selfish and it will utterly destroy the
deceptive handbill and the cooked accounts and the fictitious capital
as well the enormous dishonesties as the little lies of trade  Let this
holiness actuate the parent and in his strong and gentle rule he will
mould the hearts of his children heavenward and train them in the
admonition of the Lord until a commanded household comely in their
filial love they shall reverence their Father who is in heaven  Let the
child be impressed with holiness and he will have higher motives to
obedience than he can gather from the constraint of duty or from the
promptings of affection  Let the master be holy and while he upholds
authority he will dispense blessing  Let the servant be holy and
service will be rendered with cheerfulness not with eyeservice as
menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing God  Let the man be
holy and vigorous health and lofty intellect and swaying eloquence and
quenchless zeal will all be offered to God  Let the woman be holy and
patient prayer will linger round the cross and ardent hope will haunt
the envied sepulchre and pitying tenderness will wail on the way to
Calvary and the deep heartlove will forget all selfish solicitudes in
the absorbing question Where have they laid my Lord  Let the world be
holy and the millennium has come and wrong ceases for ever and the
tabernacle of God is with men and earths music rivals heavens
Brethren let us seek this blessing for ourselves  There at the foot of
the Throne let us plead the promise I will sprinkle clean water upon
you and you shall be clean  Imagination intellect memory
conscience willsanctify them all  Then will we teach transgressors
thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto Thee  It is done surely
it is done  The hands are upon us now  We kneel for the diviner
baptism for the effectual and blessed ordination  Listen the word has
spoken Ye are an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
IICertain blessings are presented to us in the text as the heritage of
this spiritual and consecrated Church  Increase and acceptance  The
spiritual house is to be built up firm and consolidated on the true
foundation  The services of the holy priesthood are to be acceptable to
God through Jesus  Take the first thought  Ye are built up a
spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ  The fact of Gods constant
supervision over his Church and care for its stability and extension is
one that is impressed with earnest repetition upon the pages of his word
Thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that
shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken but there the
glorious Lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams
Then shall thou see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be
enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee
the forces of the Gentiles shall come unto thee  Then shall the
mountain of the Lords house be established in the top of the mountains
and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto
it  As I live saith the Lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them
all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth  From
these passages and many others breathing the same spirit we may
legitimately infer that it is the purpose of God that the kingdom of
Messiah shall be universal that the Church shall increase in steady and
cumulative progression and realize in herself all the glorious things
which by the holy prophets were spoken of the city of God  And in this
matter God has not left himself without a witness  The present existence
of the Church after it has encountered and outlived all varieties of
opposition is in itself a proof which even its enemies if they were not
stupid and indocile learners might ere this have discovered that the
eternal God is its refuge and that the Highest will establish it for
ever  From its institution it has had in the heart of every man a
natural and inveterate enemy  The world has uniformly opposed it and it
has been unable to repel that opposition with weapons out of the worlds
armoury for it is forbidden to rely upon the strength of armies or upon
the forces of external power  Fanatics have entered into unholy
combination  Herod and Pilate have truced up a hollow friendship that
they might work against it together  Statesmen have elaborated their
policy and empires have concentrated their strength the banners of
battle have made hideous laughter with the wind the blood of many
sainted confessors has been shed like water and the vultures of the crag
have scented the unburied witnesses and have been ready to swoop down
upon the slain  And yet the Church is living thriving multiplying
while the names of its tyrants are forgotten and their kingdoms like
snowflakes on the wave have left no trace behind  No inborn strength
will account for this mystery  No advance of intelligence nor
philosophic enlightenment will explain this phenomenon  The acute
observer if faith have cleared his eye or opened an inner one will go
back for the explanation to an old and unforgotten promise and will
exclaim when he sees the Church struggling but triumphant like the
firegirdled bush at Horeb God is in the midst of her she shall not be
moved God shall help her and that right early  And not only in the
preservation from her enemies but in her unfailing progress among men in
every age has God shown that his purpose is to build up the spiritual
house  The rapid spread of the truth in primitive times was a marvel and
a mystery to those who saw not the arm which upheld it and the power
which bade it multiply and grow  The whole history of gospel extension
is indeed a succession of wonders  It began with a Pentecost local but
prophetic of a universal one when its sound shall have gone out into
all the earth and its words to the end of the world  In the times of
the Apostles and of their immediate successors it overleaped the
boundaries of nation after nation acquired lodgment and proselytes in
the proudest cities subjugated the barbaric magnificence of Asia Minor
had its students in the schools of Greece and its servitors in the
imperial household at Rome  In its triumphant course it attacked
idolatry in its strongholds and that idolatry though fortified by habit
and prejudice and sanctioned by classic learning and entwined with the
beautiful in architecture and song and venerable for its wondrous age
and imperial in the dominion which it had exercised over a vassal world
fell speedily utterly and for ever  And in each succeeding age
obscured sometimes by the clouds of persecution and sometimes by the
mists of error its progress has been gradual and sure  If it has not
dissipated it has relieved the darkness  It has stamped itself upon the
institutions of mankind and they reflect its image  It has insinuated
its leavening spirit where its outward expressions are not and there is
a vast amount of Christian and humanizing sentiment abroad a sort of
atmosphere breathed unconsciously by every man whose airwaves break
upon society with unfelt but influencing pressure but its source is in
the gospel of Christ  The building rises still  In distant parts of the
great worldquarry stones of diverse hardness and of diverse hue but
all susceptible of being wrought upon by the heavenly masonry are every
day being shaped for the temple  Strikes among the workmen or frost in
the air may suspend operations for awhile but the building rises
Often are the stones prepared in silence as in the ancient templepile
with no sound of the chisel or the hammer  The Sanballats and Tobiahs of
discouragement and shame may deride the work and embarrass the labourers
but one by one the living stones polished after the similitude of a
palace are incorporated into it  Yes the building rises and it shall
rise for ever  God has promised increase to the Church and her enemies
cannot gainsay it  From the more effectual blessing on churches already
formed from the reversal of the attainder and the bringing into his
patrimonial portion of the disinherited Jew from the proclamation in all
lands of the message of mercy they shall throng into the city of our
solemnities until the waste and the desolate places and the land of her
destruction shall even now be too many by reason of the inhabitants and
they that swallowed thee up shall be far away  What Christian heart
looking for this promised blessing rejoices not with exceeding joy  At
the foundation of the second temple amid the flare of trumpets and the
clang of cymbals while the young men rent the air with gladness there
were choking memories in many a Levite heart that chastened the solemn
joy and were relieved only by passionate tears but at the upbuilding of
the spiritual house the young and the old may feel an equal gladness
or if some memories steal over the spirit of primitive days and of the
joys of a forfeited Eden they may be stilled by the memory of the
grander and abiding truth that
In Christ the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost
Brethren have you this joy  Does it pleasure you that the building
rises  Do your hearts thrill with gladness as you hear of accessions to
the Church and the conversion of sinners to God  Do you love the gates
of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob  Have a care if you feel
not this sympathy for ye are none of his  If it is within you a living
earnest emotion give it play  Let the children of Zion be joyful in
their King
The second privilege is the acceptance of her service and sacrifice
through Jesus ChristTo us who are mean and unworthy it is no small
privilege to be assured of welcome when we come to God  To us who are
guilty and erring it is no small privilege that we can come by Jesus
Christ  The hope of acceptance is necessary to sustain the heart of the
worshipper which without it would soon sink into despair  The apostle
you perceive places the ground of the acceptance of our services upon
our union with Jesus Christ
Vain in themselves their duties were
Their services could never please
Till joind with thine and made to share
The merits of thy righteousness
He is careful to impress upon us that in our holiest moments no less than
when we are wayward and criminal our trust for personal safety and our
only chance of blessing are from our exalted Daysman who can lay his
hand upon us both  Our praise would be unmeaning minstrelsy our prayers
a litany unheard and obsolete all our devotional service a bootless
trouble but that yonder the Intercessor stands and pours his
allprevailing prayer  It is through Him we both the Jews who
crucified Him and the Gentiles who by their persevering neglect of Him
crucify Him afresh have access by one spirit unto the Father  The
words of promise touching the acceptance of the worship of the Church are
explicit and numerous  They shall come up with acceptance on mine
altar and I will glorify the house of my glory  That I should be the
minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles ministering the gospel of God
that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable being
sanctified by the Holy Ghost  In the place where my name is recorded
there will I accept  In every nation he that feareth Him and worketh
righteousness is accepted with Him  Oh comforting thought when I am
convinced of my own sinfulness and restless and disquieted wander about
in distress and lie down in sorrow there is One who hears the stammered
entreaty and smiles a pardon to my agonized cry God be merciful to me
a sinner  When in my daily life I encounter a terrible temptation a
temptation so strong that it tries my strength to the uttermost and
gives my heart a struggle and a bitterness which no stranger may know
there is One who marks my resistance and counts my enduring faith for
righteousness and whispers me that by and bye he that overcometh shall
wear the conquerors crown  When in some moment of unguardedness I
grieve the good Spirit and become unwatchful and in remorseful
penitence I could almost weep my life away the offering of my contrition
is accepted and there is One who heals my backsliding and soothes my
fretting sorrow  My prayers offered in secret pleading for purity and
blessing my praises when the full heart attuned gives its note of
blessing to swell the choral harmony wherewith all Gods works praise
Him the active hand the ready tongue the foot swift and willing in his
cause the service of labour the service of sufferingall these if I
offer them rightly and reliantly are acceptable unto God by Jesus
Christ  There is no room for distrust or for misgiving  I need not fear
that after all my efforts I shall be met with an averted glance or
with a cold denial  The promise standeth sure To that man will I
look  Oh if there had been a pause after this announcement how would
the eager solicitudes of men have gathered round it and waited for the
coming of the words  Where wilt thou direct thy look of favour  To him
who is noble or wealthy or intelligent  To him who with scrupulous
rigidness fasts twice in the week and gives tithes of all that he
possesses  To him whose quick sensibility revels in all expressions of
the beautiful or whose graceful impulse moves him in all works of
charity  No to none of these but To him that is poor and of a
contrite spirit and that trembleth at my word
IIIIf there be this assurance of acceptance how solemn and resistless
is the call to duty To offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
by Jesus Christ  Sacrifice properly speaking is the infliction of
death upon a living creature for the purposes of religious worship but
this sacrifice and offering happily God requires not at our hands
No filleted firstling need now be led to the altar the flocks of Kedar
and the rams of Nebaioth may browse quietly in their pastures for the
Great Sacrifice has been offered and it abidesone sacrifice for
sins for ever needing no repetition one for ever unexhausted in its
virtue and unfailing in the blessing it confers  But in a secondary
sense the recognized and fulfilled duties of the Church are fitly called
sacrifices for they cannot be properly discharged without the alienation
from ourselves of something that was our own and its presentation
whether time ease property or influence to God  Brethren to this
duty you are called today  The name you bear has bound you  The holy
priesthood must offer up spiritual sacrifices  Suffered to become
Christians permitted a race adulterous and dishonoured as you were to
be united to Christ and partakers of his precious grace the spell of
these high privileges enforces every obligation and hallows every claim
Ye are not your own  First offer yourselves upon the altar renew your
covenant in this the house of our solemnities on this the instalment of
our great Christian festival  It will be easy to devote the accessories
when the principal bestowment has been rendered  I claim from you this
sacrifice for God  Yourselves not a halfhearted homage not a
divided service not a stray emotion not a solitary faculty
yourselves you all and all of you your bodies with their
appliances for service your souls with their ardour of affection
intellect with its grasp and power life with its activity and
earnestness endowment with its manifold gifts influence with its
persuasive beseechings  I claim them all  I beseech you therefore by
the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy
acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service  This
consecration made all else will follow in the train litanies of earnest
supplication will rise from the full heart the prayer will be offered
as incense the lifting up of the hands as the evening sacrifice
Glad in its memory of the past and hopeful in its trust for the future
the hosanna of gratitude will rise the sacrifice of praise
continually the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name  The
property received gratefully from heaven will be offered freely and
bountifully for Christ and some outcast housed in a safe and friendly
shelter some emancipated slave or converted Figian some Indian breaking
from his vassaldom of caste and Shaster and longing to sit at Jesus
feet and hear his word will say rejoicingly of your liberality Having
received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of
a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to God
CHRISTS WORK OF DESTRUCTION AND DELIVERANCE
REV JOHN H JAMES
That through death He might destroy him that had the power of death
that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were
all their lifetime subject to bondageHEBREWS ii 14 15
There is a special and ordained connection between the incarnation and
the death of our blessed Lord  Other men die in due course after they
are born he was born just that he might die  He came not to be
ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for
many  It is therefore evident that the theology which magnifies the
incarnation at the expense of the atonement is fundamentally fatally
defective  The brotherhood of Christ with every son of Adam is a blessed
truth but it is by no means the whole truth nor can it be practically
available and influential apart from the offering of his body upon the
cross as a sacrifice for sin  This is very clearly and strongly put in
the text  The incarnation of the Son of God is proved from the Old
Testament and shown to have had reference to his redeeming death  Many
purposes were answered by his becoming partaker of flesh and blood  His
influence as a teacher the power of his spotless example his
identification with the needs and sorrows of humanity and the deep
sympathy resulting therefromthese and similar ends were contemplated
and fulfilled  But the grand purpose was disclosed and accomplished on
the cross where God made his soul an offering for sin  Forasmuch then
as the children are partakers of flesh and blood He also himself
likewise took part of the same that through death He might destroy him
that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who
through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
The death of Jesus then and the end to be accomplished by it
constitute the central vital culminating truth of Christianity  The
apostle puts the death of Christ in a striking point of viewas a work
done rather than a calamity suffered  And it was a double worka work
of destruction on the one hand and of deliverance on the otherof
