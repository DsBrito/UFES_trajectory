I know no ill so great beside
But if you do not like to be
So poorly fed come live with me
Agreed rejoined the wolf Ill go
But pray what work am I to do
Oh guard the house and do not fail
To bark at thieves and wag your tail
So off they joggd and soon arrived
At where the friendly mastiff lived
Well said the wolf I cant deny
You have a better house than I
Not so the other then replied
If you with me will hence abide
Oh said the wolf how kind you are
But what dye call that hanging there
Is it an iron chain or what
Friend said the dog I quite forgot
To mention that sometimes you see
They hook that little chain to me
But it is only meant to keep
Us dogs from walking in our sleep
And should you wear it you would find
Its nothing that you need to mind
Ill take your word the wolf replied
Its truth by me shall neer be tried
Ill have my liberty again
And you your collar and your chain
MORAL
Our neighbors sometimes seem to be
A vast deal better off than we
Yet seldom tis they really are
Since they have troubles too to bear
Which if the truth were really known
Are quite as grievous as our own

THE HERDSMAN
A herdsman who lived at a time and a place
Which should you not know is but little disgrace
Discoverd one morning on counting his stock
That a sheep had been stolen that night from the flock
Oh I wish I had caught ye whoever ye be
Id have soon let you know Id have soon let ye see
What he had to expect said the herdsman I trow
But Ive thought of a scheme that will trouble you now
So what did he do sir but put up a board
Describing the thief and proposed a reward
Of a lamb to the man who would give information
Concerning the thief and his true designation
The project succeeded for soon there applied
A certain near neighbor with others beside
But tell me the thief said the herdsman at least
Come hither said they and well show you the beast
The beast said the rustic who thought he should die on
The spot when he found that the thief was a lion
Ill luck to my hurry what now shall I do
I promised a lamb to detect you tis true
But now Id consent all my substance to pay
If I could but with safety get out of your way
MORAL
Silly people ask things that would ruin if sent
They demand them in haste and at leisure repent

THE BOYS AND THE FROGS
Some boys beside a pond or lake
Were playing once at duck and drake
When doubtless to their hearts content
Volleys of stones were quickly sent
But there were some there will be such
Who did not seem amused so much
These were the frogs to whom the game
In point of sport was not the same
For scarce a stone arrived tis said
But gave some frog a broken head
And scores in less than half an hour
Perished beneath the dreadful shower
At last said one You silly folks I say
Do fling your stones another way
Though sport to you to throw them thus
Remember pray tis death to us
MORAL
From hence this moral may be learnd
Let play be play to all concernd

THE COCK AND THE JEWEL
A cock there was a sage was he
If Esop we may trust
Who wishd to make a meal you see
As other sages must
With this intent as heretofore
When on the hunt for grain
Our hero scratchd the litter oer
With all his might and main
But scarce a minute had he scratchd
When to his great surprise
A gem with golden chain attachd
He saw with both his eyes
Alack quoth he what have we here
A diamond I protest
Which lords and ladies buy so dear
And hold in such request
But one good barleycorn to me
Has more intrinsic worth
Than all the pearls now in the sea
Or gold now in the earth
MORAL
The moral here in Esops mind
Was this theres not a doubt
Things have most value which we find
We cannot do without
Illustration
THE MAN AND THE LION
A man and a lion once had a dispute
Which was reckond the greatest the man or the brute
The lion discoursed on his side at some length
And greatly enlarged on his courage and strength
The man one would think had enough to reply
On his side the question which none could deny
But like many others who make a pretence
He talkd perfect nonsense and thought it good sense
So says he dont be pratinglook yonder I pray
At that sculpture of marble now what will you say
The lion is vanquished but as for the man
He is striding upon him deny it who can
But pray said the lion who sculptured that stone
One of us said the man I must candidly own
But when we are sculptors the other replied
You will then on the man see the lion astride
MORAL
The man might have added if he had been wise
But a beast cannot sculpture a stone if he tries
That sufficiently shows where the difference lies

THE FOX AND THE CRANE
I certainly think said a fox to a crane
That face maam of yours is remarkably plain
That beak that you wear is so frightful a feature
It makes you appear a most singular creature
The crane much offended at what she had heard
Marchd off at full speed without saying a word
Oh dear said the fox Mrs Crane I protest
You misunderstand me twas only a jest
Come dont be affrontedstay with me and dine
You know very well tis this temper of mine
To say such odd things to my intimate friends
But you know that poor Reynard no mischief intends
So the crane thought it best not to break with him quite
But to view his remarks in a goodnatured light
So she put on as pleasant a face as she could
When he askd her to dine and replied that she would
But alas she perceived that his jokes were not over
When Reynard removed from the victuals its cover
Twas neither game butchers meat chicken not fish
But plain gravysoup in a broad shallow dish
Now this the fox lappd with his tongue very quick
While the crane could scarce dip in the point of her beak
You make a poor dinner said he to his guest
Oh dear by no means said the bird I protest
But the crane askd the fox on a subsequent day
When nothing it seems for their dinner had they
But some minced meat served up in a narrowneckd jar
Too long and narrow for Reynard by far
You make a poor dinner I fear said the bird
Why I think said the fox twould be very absurd
To deny what you say yet I cannot complain
But confess though a fox that Im matched by a crane
MORAL
Cunning folks who play tricks which good manners condemn
Often find their own tricks playd again upon them

THE TRAVELLER AND THE SATYR
A luckless wight in winter slow
Travelling once a forest through
Cold and hungry tired and wet
Began in words like these to fret
Oh what a sharp inclement day
And what a dismal dreary way
No friendly cot no cheering fields
No food this howling forest yields
Ive nought in store or expectation
Theres nought before me but starvation
Not quite so bad a voice replied
Quickly the traveller turned aside
And saw the satyr of the wood
Who close beside his dwelling stood
Here is my cave hard by said he
Walk in youre welcome pray be free
The traveller did not hesitate
Hoping for something good to eat
But followd to his hearts content
Blowing his finger as he went
Pray said the satyr may I know
For what you blow your fingers so
What need you said the man be told
To warm my fingers numbd with cold
Indeed was all his host replied
Intent some pottage to provide
Which heated well with spice infused
Was to his shivering guest produced
So hot it was as Esop sung
It made our traveller scald his tongue
And wishing not again to do it
Our hero could not wait but blew it
What said his host in accent rough
Is not your pottage hot enough
Yes said the man full well I know it
Tis far too hot thats why I blow it
You artful villain do you so
His host replied with angry brow
My cave shall not a moment hold
A man that blows both hot and cold
By none but rogues can that be done
You doubledealing wretch begone
MORAL
The traveller scarce deserved such wrath
For warming fingerscooling broth
No statutes old or new forbid it
Although with the same mouth he did it
Yet this beware of old and young
What Esop meanta double tongue
Which flatters now with civil clack
And slanders soon behind ones back
Illustration
THE TRAVELLERS AND THE PURSE
Two friends once were walking in sociable chat
When a purse one espied on the ground
Oh see said he thank my fortune for that
What a large sum of money Ive found
Nay do not say I said his friend for you know
Tis but friendship to share it with me
I share it with you said the other How so
He who found it the owner should be
Be it so said his friend but what sound do I hear
Stop thief one is calling to you
He comes with a constable close in the rear
Said the other Oh what shall we do
Nay do not say we said his friend for you know
You claimed the sole right to the prize
And since all the money was taken by you
With you the dishonesty lies
MORAL
When people are selfish dishonest and mean
Their nature in dealing will quickly be seen
Illustration
THE MOUTH AND THE LIMBS
In days of yore they say twas then
When all things spoke their mind
The arms and legs of certain men
To treason felt inclined
These arms and legs together met
As snugly as they could
With knees and elbows hands and feet
In discontented mood
Said they Tis neither right nor fair
Nor is there any need
To labor with such toil and care
The greedy mouth to feed
This were resolved no more to do
Though we so long have done it
Ah said the knees and elbows too
And we are bent upon it
I said the tongue may surely speak
Since I his inmate am
And for his vices while you seek
His virtues Ill proclaim
You say the mouth embezzles all
The fruit of your exertion
But I on this assembly call
To prove the base assertion
The food which you with labor gain
He too with labor chews
Nor does he long the food retain
But gives it for your use
But he his office has resignd
To whom you may prefer
He begs you therefore now to find
Some other treasurer
Well be it so they all replied
His wish shall be obeyed
We think the hands may now be tried
As treasurers in his stead
The hands with joy to this agreed
And all to them was paid
But they the treasure kept indeed
And no disbursements made
Once more the clamrous members met
A lean and hungry throng
When all allowed from head to feet
That what theyd done was wrong
To take his office once again
The mouth they all implored
Who soon accepted it and then
Health was again restored
MORAL
This tale for state affairs is meant
Which we need not discuss
At present we will be content
To find a moral thus
The mouth has claims of large amount
From arms legs feet and hands
But let them not on that account
Pay more than it demands

THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE
Said a hare to a tortoise Good sir what a while
You have been only crossing the way
Why I really believe that to go half a mile
You must travel two nights and a day
I am very contented the creature replied
Though I walk but a tortoises pace
But if you think proper the point to decide
We will run half a mile in a race
Very good said the hare said the tortoise Proceed
And the fox shall decide who has won
Then the hare started off with incredible speed
But the tortoise walkd leisurely on
Come tortoise friend tortoise walk on said the hare
Well I shall stay here for my dinner
Why twill take you a month at that rate to get there
Then how can you hope to be winner
But the tortoise could hear not a word that she said
For he was far distant behind
So the hare felt secured while at leisure she fed
And took a sound nap when she dined
So at last this slow walker came up with the hare
And there fast asleep did he spy her
And he cunningly crept with such caution and care
That she woke not although he passd by her
Well now thought the hare when she opend her eyes
For the raceand I soon shall have done it
But who can describe her chagrin and surprise
When she found that the tortoise had won it
MORAL
Thus plain plodding people we often shall find
Will leave hasty confident people behind

THE MILKMAID
A milkmaid who poized a full pail on her head
Thus mused on her prospects in life it is said
Lets seeI should think that this milk will procure
One hundred good eggs or fourscore to be sure
Well thenstop a bitit must not be forgotten
Some of these may be broken and some may be rotten
But if twenty for accidents should be detachd
It will leave me just sixty sound eggs to hatchd
Well sixty sound eggsno sound chickens I mean
Of these some may diewell suppose seventeen
Seventeennot so manysay ten at the most
Which will leave fifty chickens to boil or to roast
But then theres their barley how much will they need
Why they take but one grain at a time when they feed
So thats a mere trifle now then let us see
At a fair market price how much money therell be
Six shillings a pairfivefourthreeandsix
To prevent all mistakes that low price I will fix
Now what will that make fifty chickens I said
Fifty times threeandsixpenceIll ask brother Ned
Oh but stopthreeandsixpence a pair I must sell em
Well a pair is a couplenow then let us tell em
A couple in fifty will gomy poor brain
Why just a score times and five pair will remain
Twentyfive pair of fowlsnow how shameful it is
That I cant reckon up as much money as this
Well theres no use in trying so lets give a guess
I will say twenty pounds and it cant be no less
Twenty pounds I am certain will buy me a cow
Thirty geese and two turkeyseight pigs and a sow
Now if these turn out well at the end of the year
I shall fill both my pockets with guineas tis clear
Then Ill bid that old tumbledown hovel goodbye
My mother shell scold and my sisters theyll cry
But I wont care a crows egg for all they can say
I shant go to stop with such beggars as they
But forgetting her burden when this she had said
The maid superciliously tossd up her head
When alas for her prospectsthe milk pail descended
And so all her schemes for the future were ended
MORAL
This moral I think may be safely attachd
Reckon not on your chickens before they are hatchd

THE LARK AND HER YOUNG ONES
A lark who had her nest conceald
Says Esop in a barley field
Began as harvest time drew near
The reaping of the corn to fear
Afraid they would her nest descry
Before her tender brood could fly
She charged them therefore every day
Before for food she flew away
To watch the farmer in her stead
And listen well to all he said
It chanced one day she scarce was gone
Ere the farmer came and his son
The farmer well his field surveyd
And sundry observations made
At last Ill tell you what said he
This corn is fit to cut I see
But we our neighbors help must borrow
So tell them we begin tomorrow
Just after this the lark returned
When from her brood this news she learned
Ah dearest mother then said they
Pray let us all begone today
My dears said she you need not fret
I shall not be uneasy yet
For if he waits for neighbors aid
The business long will be delayd
At dawn she left her nest once more
And charged her young ones as before
At five the farmer came again
And waited for his friends in vain
Well said the man I fancy son
These friends we cant depend upon
Tomorrow early mind you go
And let our own relations know
Again the lark approachd her nest
When round her all her young ones pressd
And told their mother word for word
The fresh intelligence they heard
Ah children be at ease said she
Were safe another day I see
For these relations you will find
Just like his friends will stay behind
At dawn again the lark withdrew
And did again her charge renew
Once more the farmer early came
And found the case was just the same
The day advanced the sun was high
But not a single help drew nigh
Then said the farmer Hark ye son
I see this job will not be done
While thus we wait for friends and neighbors
So you and Ill commence our labors
Tomorrow early well begin
Ourselves and get our harvest in
Now said the lark when this she heard
Our movement must not be deferrd
For if the farmer and his son
Themselves begin twill soon be done
The morrow proved the lark was right
For all was cut and housed by night
MORAL
Hence while we wait for others aid
Our business needs must be delayd
Which might be done with half the labor
Twould take to go and call a neighbor

THE PHILOSOPHER AND THE
ACORN
A philosopher proud of his wit and his reason
Sat him under an oak in a hot summer season
On the oak grew an acorn or two it is said
On the ground grew a pumpkin as big as his head
Thought the sage Whats the reason this oak is so strong
A few acorns to bear that are scarce an inch long
While this poor feeble plant has a weight to sustain
Which had much better hang on the tree it is plain
But just at the time the philosopher spoke
An acorn droppd down on his head from the oak
Then said he who just now thought his plan was so clever
I am glad that this was not a pumpkin however
MORAL
The sage would no doubt have looked grievously dull
Had a pumpkin descended with force on his scull
Of his folly then let us in future beware
And believe that such matters are best as they are
Leave the manners and customs of oak trees alone
Of acorns and pumpkinsand look to our own

THE WOLF AND THE CRANE
A wolf once forgetting the size of his swallow
Tried to pass a large marrowbone through it
Oh dear said the beast thinking death was to follow
How careless and stupid to do it
His mouth was proppd open by means of the bone
And his breathing was greatly impeded
But a crane coming up he contrived to make known
What kind of assistance he needed
How dye do said the bird said the beast Very ill
For a bone has gone down the wrong way
But if you can extract it by means of your bill
The service Ill amply repay
Thought the crane Im no surgeon yet all must agree
That my bill will make excellent forceps
And as for the money I do not now see
Why I need refuse taking his worships
Said the bird Its agreed said his patient Proceed
And take the bone hence I beseech
Which after awhile and with infinite toil
The crane at last managed to reach
Thank my stars said the beast from his terrors released
Thank you too sir said he to the bird
Alas said the crane is this all Im to gain
