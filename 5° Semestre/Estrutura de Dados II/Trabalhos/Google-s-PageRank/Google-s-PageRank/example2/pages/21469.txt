rightminded girl was not far or near to be found
Some four years before the time of which I am now speaking my father
sailed in command of a fine ship the Amphion for the Eastern seas
The time we had expected him to return had long passed away  My mother
did not however give up all expectation of seeing him but day after
day and week after week we looked for him in vain  The owners at last
wrote word that they feared the ship had been lost in a typhoon but yet
it was possible that she might have been cast away on some uninhabited
island from whence the crew could not effect their escape  My mother
therefore still hoped on and endeavoured to eke out her means so as to
retain her house that my father might find a home should he return
I was setting off with Uncle Jack for the Lily which was undergoing a
thorough repair and he seldom failed to pay her one or two visits in
the day to see how things were going on when two seamen came rolling up
the street towards us in sailor fashion and looking it seemed to me
as if they had been drinking though they may not have been exactly
drunk  As they approached one nudged the other and looking at Uncle
Jack exchanged a few words
They would have passed us when he having noticed this hailed them
What cheer my hearties have we ever sailed together
Cant say exactly sir for weve knocked about at sea so long that
its hard to mind all the officers weve served under  But now I looks
at you sir I think you used to come aboard the Amphion before she
left Old England  We heard say you were the captains brother
The Amphion exclaimed Uncle Jack eagerly looking hard at the men
Can you give me any news of her
Aye sir but its bad news
Out with it whatever it is exclaimed Uncle Jack fixing his eyes on
the man to judge whether he spoke the truth
Its a matter of over four years gone by when we sailed for the Eastern
seas  We had been knocking about in them parts for some months when we
were caught in a regular hurricane which carried away our topmasts and
mainyard and did other damage  At the same time we sprang a leak and
had to keep the pumps going without a moments rest  When night came
on and a terrible dark night it was sir matters grew worse and worse
not a hope but that the ship would go down though we wellnigh worked
our arms off to keep her afloat  Howsomedever before long she struck
on a reef though she hadnt been thrashing away on it three minutes
when she drove off and the water came rushing in like a mill stream
Out boats was the cry  Bill here and I with three others got into
the jollyboat but before another soul could spring aboard her she
drifted away from the ship  We felt about and found a lugsail and an
oar  To go back was more than we could do and its our belief that
scarcely had we left her than the ship went down  As our only chance of
keeping the boat afloat was to run before the sea we stepped the mast
and set the lug close reefed hoping to come upon some land or other
When morning broke no land was in sight  We thought we saw what looked
like it far away on the starboard quarter but we could only go where
the wind drove us  Three days we scudded on without a drop of water or
bit of food to put into our mouths  I speaks the truth Bill dont I
Ay ay said Bill looking as if he did not even like to think of that
time you does mate
Go on said Uncle Jack
Well first one went mad and jumped overboard then another died then
another and I thought that Bill would die too when down came a shower
and with the help of our sail we filled an empty breaker which we had in
the boat  Then we knocked down a bird which came near us and that gave
us a little more strength  Then three flyingfish came aboard which
kept us for three days more and after that we caught a small shark but
the water came to an end and we were both so wellnigh done for that
neither Bill nor I could hold an oar to steer by nor knew where we were
goingI speaks the truth dont I Bill
I suppose you does but I dont mind much what happened then  I was
too bad said Bill
Well as I was asaying I thought it was all over with us when a ship
hove in sight and took us aboard  She was a foreign craft and not a
word of what her people said could we make out any more than they could
understand us  We were not over well treated so we ran from her the
first place we touched at and after knocking about for a long spell in
them South Sea islands among the savages in one craft or another we
got home at last  What Ive told you is the blessed truth aint it
Bill
Bill grunted his assent to this assertion he evidently was not a man of
words
My uncle crossquestioned the men but could get nothing more out of
either of them  Whether or not he was perfectly satisfied I could not
tell  Still it seemed too probable that the Amphion with my father
and all hands was lost
Having lodged the seamen so as to find them again my uncle returned
with me to my mother  She was prepared for the information he had to
give her  She had for some time been persuaded of what everybody else
believed that my father was lost and she now knew herself to be a
widow  It was a severe shock to her notwithstanding  She looked at me
and my five brothers and sisters all younger than I was
What shall I do with these fatherless children she asked while her
eyes filled with tears thinking more of us than of herself my means
are almost exhausted for my dear husband saved but little and I shall
not have the wherewithall to pay the rent of this house much less their
food and clothing
God has promised to provide for the fatherless and widows answered
Uncle Jack while I have a shilling in my pocket it shall be yours
Mary  Harry too is able to support himself  Well take him aboard
the Lily and soon make a prime seaman of him
My mother looked at me grieving at the thought that I must so soon be
taken from her  Then other thoughts came into her mind
But you my dear Jack require all the means you possess for yourself
Grace has promised to become yours whenever you desire it
I know that answered Uncle Jack  I prize her love but we are both
young and can wait and true as mine is for her it must not overcome my
duty to you and yours  Captain Haiselden talks of some day going to
live on shore when he will give up charge of the Lily to me or I may
obtain a larger craft and shall make enough for Grace and you and
myself I hope  At all events my dear sister you and the children
must not starve and we shall have Harry here making his fortune  So
cheer up Mary and trust in God
I do Jack I do she answered taking his hands while the tears
still flowed down her pale cheeks  Harry will do his duty I know and
some day be able to help me and I must try to do what I can for myself
though I fear it will be but little
You have friends who will be glad to lend you a helping hand said
Uncle Jack who judged of others by himself  We may have I trust a
successful voyage and all will go well Mary
Much more he said to the same effect  My mother appeared comforted at
all events she grew calm and as Captain Haiselden consented to take me
on board as an apprentice she set herself busily to work to prepare my
outfit while my sister Mary who was next to me and my two younger
brothers were sent to school and Grace Bingley came in every day to
assist her in her task
How industriously Grace sat working away with her needle every now and
then jumping up to prevent Frank or Sally from getting into mischief
Some of the larger garments were certainly not for me  My mother had
promised to overhaul Uncle Jacks wardrobe and supply what was wanting
according to a list he gave her  I should like to describe Grace as she
sat in the bay window opposite my mother with the worktable near them
but it will suffice to say that she was young fair and pretty with
eyes that seemed to have borrowed their colour from the sky  My mother
had assumed the widows cap and might from her clear complexion and
her brown hair braided across her brow have been taken for Graces
elder sister  Though the heart of Grace must have been sad enough I
suspect she talked cheerfully endeavouring to distract my mothers
mind from the thoughts of the past as well as the approaching parting
from me  I came in occasionally and found the two sitting as I have
described but I was generally on board the brig with Uncle Jack
assisting in fitting her out and thus got initiated into many of my
duties before I ever went to sea  The captain often came on board
during the evening to see how we were getting on but during the day he
was mostly engaged in looking out for freight in addition to the cargo
he intended to ship on his own account  He was just the man the crew
were willing to serve under his countenance exhibiting sense and
determination and a kindly spirit beaming from his eyes his hair
grizzled rather by weather than by years his figure of moderate
height broad and well knit betokening strength and activity
We were to sail for Singapore after which we were to proceed eastward
to trade with the various islands in that direction
We expected to have the Lily ready for sea in about a week when just
before this time Captain Bingley who had been long absent in command of
the ship Iris of some four hundred tons returned home  I was at my
mothers one evening when Uncle Jack with Grace Bingley came in  She
looked I thought somewhat out of spirits  My mother thought so too
and asked her the cause  She hesitated for a moment as if to master her
feelings and then said
It is I have no doubt for the best and father wishes it  Mother and
I are to accompany him on his next voyage round Cape Horn and up the
western coast of America then across the Pacific to Java and so round
the world  I cannot refuse to go and of course we should both like to
see strange lands as well as being with father but I had hoped to be
able to remain with you Mary and you know how happy I should have been
in doing so
My poor mother looked much distressed  Of course if your father
wishes you to go you have no choice but I shall miss you greatly  She
could scarcely restrain her tears as she spoke
Uncle Jack became very grave as he heard what Grace said
You sail round the world  Has your father positively determined on
this he asked
I guessed his thoughts he was ready enough to encounter all the risks
and perils of the sea himself but he was very unwilling that Grace
should be exposed to them  What if the ship should be wrecked  What if
sickness should break out on board or a mutiny occur or should she be
captured by an enemy  He dreaded dangers for Grace which he did not
take into a moments consideration in regard to himself but he strove
not to allow her to perceive his anxiety
Father is not a person as you well know to be turned from his
purpose she answered trying to smile  Mother has promised to go
and I cannot let her go without me  She or father might fall ill for
he is not so strong as he was and I ought to be ready to nurse them
and I hope my dear Jack that we shall be back as soon as you are
though my chief anxiety is leaving Mary and Harry also away  Perhaps
too we may meet my father doesnt know exactly where we shall go after
we leave the China seas it must depend upon the freight obtained
It is a wide region and I was hoping that I could picture you when I
was away safe at home answered Uncle Jack but he refrained from
saying more  He was unwilling to create any anxiety in Graces mind
He certainly however looked more distressed than any of the party
After this Grace could be less at our house than usual as she had to
help her mother in preparing for their voyage  The Iris she told us
was to be got ready for sea with all despatch  Uncle Jack and I one
evening went on board to have a look at the ship that as he observed
he might at least know what sort of a craft Grace was sailing in  The
cabins were comfortably fitted up and well suited for the accommodation
of the captains wife and daughter as well as for a few other
passengers  I asked him what he thought of the ship
Shes a fine enough vessel but I can judge better of her if she were
loaded and I should like to know what sort of a crew she has he
answered  Captain Bingley is a good seaman and I respect him as
Graces father but he wants to make money and he may be tempted to
overload his ship or visit dangerous places to obtain freight
I did not see the parting between Uncle Jack and Grace as I went on
board the Lily the night before we sailed  I had already wished
goodbye to my dear mother and all the young ones and as she had to
look after them she could not come to see us off  I know very well
what she must have felt and I heartily wished when the moment came for
leaving that I could have remained to comfort and protect her  My
going away must have brought back to her recollection with painful
vividness the time when my kind father last sailed I suspect she thought
that she might never see me again still she knew that I must work for
my livelihood as I did myself and I was going to begin the profession
I had chosen and for which I had long had a desire  For dangers and
hardships I was ready fully persuaded that though I might encounter I
should get through them
We were at sea at last running down channel with a fair wind  Uncle
Jack had had no difficulty in obtaining a good crew for when he could
find them he picked up old shipmates who were always glad to sail with
him  He had promised Timothy Howlett and Bill Trinder to look them up
and they having spent the last shilling in their pockets were glad to
ship on board he hoping that they having been before in those seas
might be useful  James Ling was second mate and Sam Crowfoot boatswain
making up the complement of our officers besides which there was our
supercargo Edward Blyth a young but very intelligent man who had
already made a voyage to the Eastern seas understood Dutch as well as
the Malay languages and was thus able to act as interpreter at many of
the places where we were going  He was well informed on many subjects
also and possessed a good knowledge of natural history  I must not
forget Little Jem the smallest boy on board  Instead of being
knocked about and bullied he was somewhat of a favourite among the men
with whom however he was pretty free and easy in his way of talking
but they liked him all the better for that  To the officers he was
always respectful wellmannered and being very intelligent and
active was consequently a favourite with them
We had on board four carronades and a long gun as where we were going
it was necessary to have the means of defence but they were stowed
below during the first part of the voyage  We had also a supply of
cutlasses pistols and boarding pikes for all hands which ornamented
the fore bulk head of the main cabin though occasionally taken down to
be cleaned and polished so that they might be of use when wanted
Uncle Jack took great pains to teach me navigation and as I had learnt
mathematics at school I was soon able to take a good observation with
my sextant and to work out the calculations correctly  A knowledge of
seamanship I found was not to be obtained so rapidly though Crowfoot
the boatswain was always ready to give me instruction and express his
opinion how a vessel ought to be handled under all possible
circumstances but a large amount of presence of mind and what may be
called invention has to be exercised on numerous occasions for which
no rules can be laid down
Now Harry you see wits is what a sailor wants  Youve got learning
and with learning you can pick up navigation pretty smartly  I havent
got the learning and so I cant get a mates certificate but Ive got
the wits and have been many a long year at sea and so I am fit for a
boatswain and can take charge of a watch with any man he remarked
The wind favouring us after we left the chops of the channel we ran
into the northeast trades which took us to within two or three degrees
of the equator and after that we had the calms and heavy rains which
are invariably met with and were sometimes wet to the skin at others
roasted in the hot sun  No one suffered however and after getting out
of them we picked up a fine southeast trade wind  This carried us
down to twentysix degrees south  The meridian of the Cape was passed
about the fiftieth day after leaving the Lizard  We ran down our
easting on parallel forty south  The brig was going about eight knots
before the wind when one morning there was a cry of Man overboard
Uncle Jack who had been below sprang up the companionladder and
looking over the side saw that it was little Jem who had fallen from
the fore yardarm  Ordering all hands to brace up the yards and the man
at the wheel to put down the helm while he threw off his jacket he
leaped overboard and struck out for the boy
Heave a grating here he shouted  Harry dont come and I who was
on the point of following did as he directed
The captain was on deck a moment afterwards and made ready to lower the
lee quarter boat  Every one on board as may be supposed was busy
pulling and hauling and bracing up the yards and backing the main
topsail so that there was no time to see what had become of the first
mate and boy but the captain had his eye upon them  It was sharp work
for we knew the lives of our fellowcreatures depended upon our
exertions  I wished that I had possessed the strength of two men  As
soon as the brig was hove to I took one glance to windward  I thought
I saw Uncle Jack and the boy but I also saw what filled me with alarm
a huge albatross flying above apparently about to swoop down upon them
It was but a glance for I sprang over to the other side to jump into
the boat eager to be among those going to save them  The second mate
was already in the boat three other hands following  As soon as we got
under the stern of the brig we saw the captain standing aft pointing
in the direction we were to steer  The second mate I thought appeared
very cool
Give way lads he shouted  We shall be up to them before that bird
strikes either of them on the head for it seems that is what he is
trying to do
A long rolling sea was running and only when we were at the top of a
wave were those ahead of us visible to the mate who stood up every now
and then the better to watch them
Theres that bird making another swoop he exclaimed and soon
afterwards he cried out He has risen again  Give way lads  He may
not have struck both
I did give way as may be supposed  If one had been struck might it not
have been Uncle Jack
He has hold of the grating at last cried the mate  I see him waving
his hand  There comes the bird again
Once more my heart sank within me  I could not turn round to look or I
might have missed my stroke  The boat seemed to be making but fearfully
slow progress as I watched the brig rising to the seas and as she
pitched into them throwing the spray over her bows  There stood the
captain pointing with his hand as if to encourage us to persevere  On
and on we pulled I expecting every moment to hear the mate exclaim that
the albatross had made a fatal swoop  At last I heard a voice though a
very weak one cry Take the boy in first
I knew it was that of Uncle Jack I saw him lift little Jem up while he
held on to the gunwale  The two men in the bow then hauled him in and
next the grating on which he had supported himself
Uncle Jack sank down utterly exhausted  We passed the boy aft  He
seemed to be dead  We then dragged the first mate into the
sternsheets but could not attend to him for we were compelled to keep
our oars going to get the boat round as soon as possible  Uncle Jack
lay without moving  I saw that one of his shoes was off  He presently
came to  His first thought was for the boy whose hands and chest he
began to chafe as well as his weakness would allow
The second mate I thought might have spared a hand to help him but he
looked on it seemed to me with indifference jealous that the first
mate should have behaved so gallantly oralthough I tried to put the
thought from meangry that he had escaped  We pulled away until
rounding the stern of the brig we got alongside when a cheer burst
from the crew as they saw that we had the first mate and little Jem
safe  Eager hands stood by to lift them or board for even Uncle Jack
was still too weak to help himself  While the boat was being hoisted up
the captain directed Mr Blyth and me to carry the boy into his own
cabin he and two of the men following with the first mate who was
placed in his own berth  We in the meantime had got the boys clothes
off him and had wrapped him up in a dry blanket while we kept chafing
his chest arms and feet until he breathed freely  He soon returned to
consciousness and looking about him was much surprised to find where he
was
Wheres Mr Radburn  Oh sir have you got him safe was his first
question
He is all right my lad
Its that bird sir its that bird sir  Oh save me from it he
continued crying out
The bird wont hurt you and Mr Radburn is safe in his cabin I hope
answered Mr Blyth in a kind voice
As soon as I could I went to see how the first mate was getting on  He
had swallowed a cup of hot tea for we were just going to breakfast and
this had greatly restored him and though the captain had advised him to
be still he was putting on his dry clothes and in a short time joined
us at table
Uncle Jack said that he had felt the tips of the birds wing pass over
his head each time that it swooped down but that he had taken off his
shoe and attempted to defend himself until the bird had seized upon it
and carried it off  It will find the shoe a tough morsel to digest
he added laughing but truly I have reason to thank God that it did
not strike either little Jem or me with its sharp beak and I was so
exhausted that if the boat hadnt come up when she did I should have
been unable to keep him longer at bay
Either Mr Blyth or I stayed by Little Jem all day the captain and
first mate every now and then looking in  By night he was well enough
to be removed to his own berth forward where the men promised to look
after him
The captain and Mr Blyth complimented the first mate on his gallant
conduct but he seemed to think he had done nothing out of the way
There is one thing a man should consider before he jumps overboard and
that is whether there is too much sea on to allow of a boat being
lowered for if there is he will not only lose his own life but cause
the loss of others observed the captain  It is a hard matter
however to lay down a rule  Still it is very certain that we should do
our best to save the lives of our fellowcreatures
We once sighted an island which I believe was one of the Crozet group
In rather over three months we entered the Straits of Sunda when as we
were approaching shores the inhabitants of which were addicted to
piracy we got up our guns from the hold and mounted them and
overhauled our firearms  Before long we had a good chance of requiring
them for when running through the Straits of Banca between that island
and Sumatrawhile nearly becalmedwe made out three large prahus full
of people pulling towards us  Whether their intentions were friendly
or the reverse we could not ascertain but we certainly did not like
their looks a breeze however sprang up and we stood on our course
Soon afterwards we came in sight of the fine town of Singapore founded
in 1819 by Sir Stamford Raffles who made it a free port  At that
period a wretched village stood on its site the neighbouring harbour
being the rendezvous only of a few trading prahus  It is now a
magnificent city and upwards of a thousand squarerigged vessels anchor
annually in the roads  On the hills beyond it can be seen the
residences of the merchants surrounded by plantations of spicetrees
while excellent roads with bridges over the streams run in all
directions
Besides English churches and chapels there are Chinese Joss houses
Hindoo temples and Mohammedan mosques while large numbers of Chinese
and Malay cottages form the suburbs  The Chinese are here seen in
considerable numbers being the most industrious part of the population
and include many wealthy merchants  There are Klings from Western
India Arabs chiefly shopkeepers Parsee merchants Bengalese mostly
grooms and washmen Japanese sailors many of whom are also domestic
servants Portuguese clerks and traders from Celebes Boli and other
islands of the vast archipelago
Having discharged part of our cargo we took on board such articles as
we heard were in demand among the natives with whom we hoped to open up
a trade  In the interval Mr Blyth proposed that he and I should make a
trip into the interior  We could not however go far for the island
is only about twentyseven miles in length and eleven in breadth  We
were particularly warned not to venture into the forest as we should
run a great risk of being carried off by tigers large numbers of which
infest the jungles and it is said kill a Chinaman a day they being
the chief workers in the plantations  The captain gave me leave to
accompany the supercargo and we hired two small Timor ponies for our
excursion  We had not got far when we met a party of men carrying
between them the skin of a large tiger propped up on a sort of platform
formed of bamboos looking very fierce with its mouth open and tail on
end  They were on their way to the government office to receive the
reward given for every animal killed just as payment was made in former
years in England for the head of each wolf put out of existence  The
animal had been caught in a pit covered over with sticks and leaves the
usual mode in which they are trapped  We kept a sharp lookout with
our pistols ready to shoot a tiger should one attack us  We heard
several roars and a huge beast crossed the road in front of us  After
this we did not feel altogether comfortable expecting every moment that
it would spring out from the jungle and carry off one or both of us
We returned to the city however without an actual encounter  I cannot
stop further to describe this interesting place  In a few days we
sailed for George Town on the eastern side of the island of Penang the
seat of Government of the British possessions in the Straits of Malacca
Penang is larger than Singapore a considerable portion being rocky and
those most industrious of mortals the Chinese form the chief part of
the population  After discharging the cargo we had brought from England
for this place we again sailed steering through the straits of
Singapore for the eastward
CHAPTER TWO
We were bound for Kuching the capital town of the province of Sarawak
in Borneo where Mr Brooke who went out in 1839 in his yacht the
Royalist had by his judgment and intrepidity established a thriving
community of which he had been appointed the chief or rajah  The
captain and supercargo had mapped out our future course  This was to be
along the north coast of Borneo through the Sooloo archipelago across
the sea of Celebes to the coast of Papua and thence through the Banda
sea to Timor whence we were to return home along the southern coast of
Java  It took two days to get up to Kuching the capital of the
province of Sarawak after we had entered the mouth of the river on the
banks of which it stands  On either side were hills covered with
jungle with here and there clearings where the peaceablydisposed
natives had established themselves
Mr Blyth and I had an opportunity in company with a gentleman who was
making a shooting expedition of taking a trip into the interior  I
wish that I could describe the magnificent vegetation the gigantic
trees and the curious animals we saw  One of the most curious was the
mias  What is a mias will be asked  It is the native name of the
farfamed ourangoutang the principal wild inhabitants of this region
We were proceeding through the forest with our guns when one of our
Dyak companions came running up to tell us that he had seen a mias and
that if we made haste we might be in time to shoot it
We hurried on the Dyak leading the way until we entered a thick
jungle  He pointed to a tree far above our heads  Upon looking up we
saw a great hairy body and a huge black face gazing down upon us as if
wondering what strange creatures we could be  Mr Blyth and our friend
fired whether they had hit the mias we could not tell but it began to
move away among the higher branches at a rapid rate  Led by the Dyak we
followed when again we caught sight of it on the branch of a tree
where it remained for a minute or more  By this time we were joined by
several other Dyaks whose shouts appeared to frighten the
ourangoutang which tried to get along the edge of the forest by some
lower trees keeping however beyond the reach of our rifles  The
Dyaks flourishing their weapons rushed on ahead of us hoping to have
the honour of killing the monster  We had lost sight of them for a few
seconds when we heard fearful shrieks and shouts and running forward
we saw that the mias had either voluntarily descended the tree or had
fallen to the ground and had rushed at one of the natives who unable
to escape was standing with his spear ready to defend himself  We were
afraid in attempting to kill the mias that we might shoot the native
when just as the creature was about to seize the man with its mouth and
formidable claws our friend fired and the animal fell shot through the
heart
On measuring the mias from the top of its head to its heel we found
that it was four feet two inches long while its outstretched arms
measured seven feet three inches across  Its head and body were of the
size of a mans the legs being very short in proportion  This mias was
of the larger species many being under four feet high and some of the
females not more than three feet six inches
We saw a frog with large web feet and inflated body fly from the top
of a tall tree  It was about four inches long the back and limbs of a
shining black hue with yellow beneath  Our friend had promised us a
rich treat at supper and he produced a fruit which he told us was the
Durian  It was of the size of a large cocoanut the husk of a green
colour and covered all over with short stout spines  It grows on a
lofty tree somewhat resembling the elm  It falls immediately it is
ripe but the outer rind is so tough that it is never broken by the
fall  There are marks which show where it may be divided into five
portions these are of a satin whiteness and each one is filled with an
oval mass of creamcoloured pulp in which are two or three seeds about
the size of chestnuts  This pulp is the eatable part  Its consistency
is that of a rich custard  As to describing its taste that is more
than I can do  It is not acid nor is it sweet nor juicy but yet as
we ate it we agreed that none of these qualities were wanting and that
it was the most delicious fruit we had ever met with  The Mangosteen
which comes to perfection in Borneo is another splendid fruit of a
subacid flavour better known than the Durian  But I must not stop to
give long descriptions either of the animals or fruits we met with
Blyth and I had to return as we could not long be absent from the brig
Often had the now smiling plantations through which we passed been
plundered by bloodthirsty pirates and the heads of their inhabitants
carried off  A visitor on board gave us dreadful accounts of the
atrocities committed by the pirates in the seas through which we were to
sail
We will show them that they had better not attack us observed Captain
Haiselden pointing to our guns  The Lily is a match for all their
fleets put together
Not if the Lily is caught at anchor or in a calm you may then find
that they are too much for her was the answer  These prahus often
carry sixty men or more with guns and small arms and you would find it
no easy matter were you to be attacked to beat them off
