ARGUMENTS DRAWN FROM CERTAIN GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  70
THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCES
OF
ORGANIC EVOLUTION
Although it is generally recognised that the Origin of Species has
produced an effect both on the science and the philosophy of our age
which is without a parallel in the history of thought admirers of Mr
Darwins genius are frequently surprised at the ignorance of his work
which is displayed by many persons who can scarcely be said to belong to
the uncultured classes The reason of this ignorance is no doubt partly
due to the busy life which many of our breadwinners are constrained to
live but it is also I think partly due to mere indolence There are
thousands of educated persons who on coming home from their daily work
prefer reading literature of a less scientific character than that which
is supplied by Mr Darwins works and therefore it is that such persons
feel these works to belong to a category of books which is to them a
very large onethe books namely which never are but always to be
read Under these circumstances I have thought it desirable to supply a
short digest of the Origin of Species which any man of however busy
a life or of however indolent a disposition may find both time and
energy to follow
With the general aim of the present abstract being thus understood I
shall start at the beginning of my subject by very briefly describing
the theory of natural selection It is a matter of observable fact that
all plants and animals are perpetually engaged in what Mr Darwin calls
a struggle for existence That is to say in every generation of every
species a great many more individuals are born than can possibly
survive so that there is in consequence a perpetual battle for life
going on among all the constituent individuals of any given generation
Now in this struggle for existence which individuals will be
victorious and live Assuredly those which are best fitted to live the
weakest and the least fitted to live will succumb and die while the
strongest and the best fitted to live will be triumphant and survive
Now it is this survival of the fittest that Mr Darwin calls natural
selection Nature so to speak selects the best individuals out of
each generation to live And not only so but as these favoured
individuals transmit their favourable qualities to their offspring
according to the fixed laws of heredity it follows that the
individuals composing each successive generation have a general tendency
to be better suited to their surroundings than were their forefathers
And this follows not merely because in every generation it is only the
flower of the race that is allowed to breed but also because if in any
generation some new and beneficial qualities happen to appear as slight
variations from the ancestral type these will be seized upon by natural
selection and added by transmission in subsequent generations to the
previously existing type Thus the best idea of the whole process will
be gained by comparing it with the closely analogous process whereby
gardeners and cattlebreeders create their wonderful productions for
just as these men by always selecting their best individuals to breed
from slowly but continuously improve their stock so Nature by a
similar process of selection slowly but continuously makes the various
species of plants and animals better and better suited to the external
conditions of their life
Now if this process of continuously adapting organisms to their
environment takes place in nature at all there is no reason why we
should set any limits on the extent to which it is able to go up to the
point at which a complete and perfect adaptation is achieved Therefore
we might suppose that all species would attain to this condition of
perfect adjustment to their environment and there remain fixed And so
undoubtedly they would if the environment were itself unchanging But
forasmuch as the environmentor the sum total of the external
conditions of lifeof almost every organic type alters more or less
from century to century whether from astronomical geological and
geographical changes or from the immigrations and emigrations of other
species living on contiguous geographical areas it follows that the
process of natural selection need never reach a terminal phase And
forasmuch as natural selection may thus continue ad infinitum slowly
to alter a specific type in adaptation to a gradually changing
environment if in any case the alteration thus effected is sufficient
in amount to lead naturalists to denote the specific type by some
different name it follows that natural selection has transmuted one
specific type into another And so the process is supposed to go on over
all the countless species of plants and animals simultaneouslythe
world of organic types being thus regarded as in a state of perpetual
though gradual flux
Such then is the theory of natural selection or survival of the
fittest and the first thing we have to notice with regard to it is
that it offers to our acceptance a scientific explanation of the
numberless cases of apparent design which we everywhere meet with in
organic nature For all such cases of apparent design consist only in
the adaptation which is shown by organisms to their environment and
it is obvious that the facts are covered by the theory of natural
selection no less completely than they are covered by the theory of
intelligent design Perhaps it may be answeredThe fact that these
innumerable cases of adaptation may be accounted for by natural
selection is no proof that they are not really due to intelligent
design And in truth this is an objection which is often urged by
mindseven highly cultured mindswhich have not been accustomed to
scientific modes of thought I have heard an eminent professor tell his
class that the many instances of adaptation which Mr Darwin discovered
and described as occurring in orchids seemed to him to tell more in
favour of contrivance than in favour of natural causes and another
eminent professor once wrote to me that although he had read the
Origin of Species with care he could see in it no evidence of natural
selection which might not equally well be adduced in favour of
intelligent design But here we meet with a radical misconception of the
whole logical attitude of science For be it observed the exception
in limine to the evidence which we are about to consider does not
question that natural selection may not be able to do all that Mr
Darwin ascribes to it it merely objects to his interpretation of the
facts because it maintains that these facts might equally well be
ascribed to intelligent design And so undoubtedly they might if we
were all childish enough to rush into a supernatural explanation
whenever a natural explanation is found sufficient to account for the
facts Once admit the glaringly illogical principle that we may assume
the operation of higher causes where the operation of lower ones is
sufficient to explain the observed phenomena and all our science and
all our philosophy are scattered to the winds For the law of logic
which Sir William Hamilton called the law of parsimonyor the law which
forbids us to assume the operation of higher causes when lower ones are
found sufficient to explain the observed effectsthis law constitutes
the only logical barrier between science and superstition For it is
manifest that it is always possible to give a hypothetical explanation
of any phenomenon whatever by referring it immediately to the
intelligence of some supernatural agent so that the only difference
between the logic of science and the logic of superstition consists in
science recognising a validity in the law of parsimony which
superstition disregards Therefore I have no hesitation in saying that
this way of looking at the evidence in favour of natural selection is
not a scientific or a reasonable way of looking at it but a purely
superstitious way Let us take for instance as an illustration a
perfectly parallel case When Kepler was unable to explain by any known
causes the paths described by the planets he resorted to a supernatural
explanation and supposed that every planet was guided in its movements
by some presiding angel But when Newton supplied a beautifully simple
physical explanation all persons with a scientific habit of mind at
once abandoned the metaphysical explanation Now to be consistent the
abovementioned professors and all who think with them ought still to
adhere to Keplers hypothesis in preference to Newtons explanation
for excepting the law of parsimony there is certainly no other logical
objection to the statement that the movements of the planets afford as
good evidence of the influence of guiding angels as they do of the
influence of gravitation
So much then for the absurdly illogical position that granting the
evidence in favour of natural selection and supernatural design to be
equal and parallel we should hesitate for one moment in our choice
But of course if the evidence is supposed not to be equal and
parallelie if it is supposed that the theory of natural relation
is not so competent a theory to explain the facts of adaptation as is
that of intelligent designthen the objection is no longer the one that
we are considering It is quite another objection and one which is not
prima facie absurd it requires to be met by examining how far the
theory of natural selection is able to explain the facts Let us state
the problem clearly
Innumerable cases of adaptation of organisms to their environment are
the observed facts for which an explanation is required To supply this
explanation two and only two hypotheses are in the field Of these
two hypotheses one is intelligent design manifested in creation and
the other is natural selection manifested during the countless ages of
the past Now it would be proof positive of intelligent design if it
could be shown that all species of plants and animals were
createdthat is suddenly introduced into the complex conditions of
their life for it is quite inconceivable that any cause other than
intelligence could be competent to adapt an organism to its environment
suddenly On the other hand it would be proof presumptive of natural
selection if it could be shown that one species becomes slowly
transmuted into anotherie that one set of adaptations may be
gradually transformed into another set of adaptations according as
changing circumstances require This would be proof presumptive of
natural selection because it would then become amply probable that
natural selection might have brought about many or most of the cases
of adaptations which we see and if so the law of parsimony excludes
the rival hypothesis of intelligent design Thus the whole question as
between natural selection and supernatural design resolves itself into
thisWere all the species of plants and animals separately created or
were they slowly evolved For if they were specially created the
evidence of supernatural design remains unrefuted and irrefutable
whereas if they were slowly evolved that evidence has been utterly and
for ever destroyed The doctrine of natural selection therefore depends
for its validity on the doctrine of organic evolution for if once the
fact of organic evolution were established no one would dispute that
much of the adaptation was probably effected by natural selection How
much we cannot sayprobably never shall be able to say for even Mr
Darwin himself does not doubt that other causes besides that of natural
selection have assisted in the modifying of specific types For the
sake of simplicity however I shall not go into this subject but shall
always speak of natural selection as the only cause of organic
evolution Let us then weigh the evidence in favour of organic
evolution If we find it wanting we need have no complaints to make of
natural theologians of today but if we find it to be full measure
shaken together and running over we ought to maintain that natural
theologians can no longer adhere to the arguments of such writers as
Paley Bell and Chalmers without deliberately violating the only
logical principle which separates science from fetishism
To avoid misapprehension however I may here add that while Mr
Darwins theory is thus in plain and direct contradiction to the theory
of design or system of teleology as presented by the school of writers
which I have named I hold that Mr Darwins theory has no point of
logical contact with the theory of design in the larger sense that
behind all secondary causes of a physical kind there is a primary cause
of a mental kind Therefore throughout this essay I refer to design in
the sense understood by the narrower forms of teleology or as an
immediate cause of the observed phenomena Whether or not there is an
ultimate cause of a psychical kind pervading all nature a causa
causarum which is the final raison detre of the cosmos this is
another question which as I have said I take to present no point of
logical contact with Mr Darwins theory or I may add with any of the
methods and results of natural science The only position therefore
which I here desire to render plain is that if the doctrine of
evolution is seen to be established by sufficient evidence and
therefore the causes which it sets forth are recognised as adequate to
furnish a scientific explanation of the results observed then the
facts of organic nature necessarily fall into the same logical category
with reference to any question of design as that of all or any other
series of facts in the physical universe
This being understood I shall now proceed to render an epitome of the
evidence in favour of organic evolution and I shall do so by
classifying the arguments in a way tending to show their distinct or
independent character and therefore calculated to display the
additional force which they acquire from their cumulative nature
I
THE ARGUMENT FROM CLASSIFICATION
I shall first take the argument from classification Naturalists find
that all species of plants and animals present among themselves
structural affinities According as these structural affinities are more
or less pronounced the various species are classified under genera
orders families classes subkingdoms and kingdoms Now in such a
classification it is found impossible to place all the species in a
linear series according to the grade of their organization For
instance we cannot say that a wolf is more highly organized than a fox
or a jackal we can only say that the specific points wherein it
differs from these animals are without significance as proving the one
type to be more highly organized than the others But of course in many
cases and especially in the cases of the larger divisions it is often
possible to sayThe members in this division are more highly organized
than are the members in that division Our system of classification
therefore may be likened to a tree in which a short trunk may be taken
to represent the lowest organisms which cannot properly be termed either
plants or animals This short trunk soon separates into two large
trunks one of which represents the vegetable and the other the animal
kingdom Each of these trunks then gives off large branches signifying
classes and these give off smaller but more numerous branches
signifying families which ramify again into orders genera and finally
into the leaves which may be taken to represent species Now in such
a representative tree of life the height of any branch from the ground
may be taken to indicate the grade of organization which the leaves or
species present so that if we picture to ourselves such a tree we
will understand that while there is a general advance of organization
from below upwards there are numberless slight variations in this
respect between leaves growing even on the same branch but in a still
greater number of cases leaves growing on the same branch are growing
on the same levelthat is although they represent different species
it cannot be said that one is more highly organized than the other Now
this treelike arrangement of specific organisms in nature is an
arrangement for which Mr Darwin is not responsible I mean that the
framing of this natural classification has been the work of naturalists
for centuries past and although they did not know what they were doing
it is now evident to evolutionists that they were tracing the lines of
genetic relationship For be it observed a scientific or natural
classification differs very much from a popular or haphazard
classification and the difference consists in this that while a
popular classification is framed with exclusive reference to the
external appearance of organisms a scientific classification is made
with reference to the whole structure A whale for instance is often
thought to be a fish because it resembles a fish in form and habits
whereas dissection shows that it is beyond all comparison more unlike a
fish than it is like a horse or a man This is of course an extreme
case but it was cases such as this that first led naturalists to see
that there are resemblances between organisms much more deep and
important than appear upon the surface and consequently that if a
natural classification was possible at all it must be made with
reference to these deeper resemblances Of course it took time to
perceive this distinction between fundamental and superficial
resemblances I remember once reading a very comical disquisition in one
of Buffons works on the question as to whether or not a crocodile was
to be classified as an insect and the instructive feature in the
disquisition was this that although a crocodile differs from an insect
as regards every conceivable particular of its internal anatomy no
allusion at all is made to this fact while the whole discussion is made
to turn on the hardness of the external casing of a crocodile resembling
the hardness of the external casing of a beetle and when at last Buffon
decides that on the whole a crocodile had better not be classified as
an insect the only reason given is that as a crocodile is so very
large an animal it would make altogether too terrible an insect
But now when at last it came to be recognised that internal anatomy
rather than external appearance was to be taken as a guide to
classification the question was What features in the internal anatomy
are to take precedence over the other features And this question it was
not hard to answer A porpoise for instance has a large number of
teeth and in this feature resembles most fish while it differs from
all mammals But it also gives suck to its young and in this feature it
differs from all fish while it resembles all mammals Now looking at
those two features alone should we say that a porpoise ought to be
classed as a fish or as a mammal Assuredly as a mammal and for this
reason The number of teeth is a very variable feature both in fish and
in mammals whereas the giving of suck is an invariable feature among
mammals and occurs nowhere else in the animal kingdom This of course
is purposely chosen as a very simple illustration but it exemplifies
the general fact that the guiding principle of scientific
classification is the comparing of organism with organism with the view
of seeing which of the constituent organs are of the most invariable
occurrence and therefore of the most typical signification
Now since the days of Linnus this principle has been carefully
followed and it is by its aid that the treelike system of
classification has been established No one even long before Darwins
days ever dreamed of doubting that this system is in reality what it
always has been in name a natural system What then is the
inference we are to draw from it An evolutionist answers that it is
just such a system as his theory of descent would lead him to expect as
a natural system For this treelike system is as clear an expression as
anything could be of the fact that all species are bound together by the
ties of genetic relationship If all species were separately created it
is almost incredible that we should everywhere observe this progressive
shading off of characters common to larger groups into more and more
specialized characters distinctive only of smaller and smaller groups
At any rate to say the least the law of parsimony forbids us to
ascribe such effects to a supernatural cause acting in so whimsical a
manner when the effects are precisely what we should expect to follow
from the action of a highly probable natural cause The classification
of animal forms indeed as Darwin Lyell and Hckel have pointed out
strongly resembles the classification of languages In the case of
languages as in the case of species we have genetic affinities
strongly marked so that it is possible to some extent to construct a
languagetree the branches of which shall indicate in a diagrammatic
form the progressive divergence of a large group of languages from a
common stock For instance Latin may be regarded as a fossil language
which has given rise by way of genetic descent to a group of living
languagesItalian Spanish French and to a large extent English
Now what should we think of a philologist who should maintain that
English French Spanish and Italian were all specially created
languagesor languages separately constructed by the Deity and by as
many separate acts of inspiration communicated to these several
nationsand that their resemblance to the fossil form Latin is to be
attributed to special design Yet the evidence of the natural
transmutation of species is in one respect much stronger than that of
the natural transmutation of languagesin respect namely of there
being a vastly greater number of cases all bearing testimony to the fact
of genetic relationship
II
THE ARGUMENT FROM MORPHOLOGY OR STRUCTURE
I now pass to another line of argument The theory of evolution by
natural selection supposes that hereditary characters admit of being
slowly modified wherever their modification will render an organism
better suited to a change in its conditions of life Let us then
observe the evidence we have of such adaptive modifications of
structure in cases where the need of such modification is apparent For
the sake of clearness I shall begin by again taking the case of the
whales and porpoises The theory of evolution infers from the whole
structure of these animals that their progenitors must have been
terrestrial quadrupeds of some kind which became aquatic in their
habits Now the change in the conditions of their life thus brought
about would render desirable great modifications of structure These
changes would in the first instance begin to affect the least
typicalthat is the least strongly inherited structuressuch as the
skin claws and teeth c But as time went on the adaptation would
begin to extend to the more typical structures until the shape of the
body began to be affected by the bones and muscles required for
terrestrial locomotion becoming better adapted for aquatic locomotion
and the whole outline of the animal more fishlike in shape This is the
stage which we actually observe in the seals where the hind legs
although retaining all their typical bones have become shortened up
almost to rudiments and directed backwards so as to be of no use for
walking but serving to complete the fishlike taper of the body But in
the whales the modification has gone even further than this so that the
hind legs have ceased to be apparent externally and are only
represented internally by remnants so rudimentary that it is impossible
to make out with certainty the homologies of the bones moreover the
head and the whole body have become completely fishlike in shape But
profound as these changes are they only affect those parts of the
organism which it was for the benefit of the organism to have altered
so that it might be adapted to an aquatic mode of existence Thus the
arm which is used as a fin still retains the bones of the shoulder
forearm wrist and fingers although they are all inclosed in a
finshaped sack so as to render them quite useless for any other
purpose than swimming Similarly the head although it so closely
resembles the head of a fish in shape still retains the bones of the
mammalian skull in their proper anatomical relation to one another but
modified in form so as to offer the least possible amount of resistance
to the water In short it may be said that all the modifications have
been effected with the least possible divergence from the typical
mammalian type which is compatible with securing so perfect an
adaptation to a purely aquatic mode of life
Now I have chosen the case of the whale and porpoise group because they
offer so extreme an example of profound modification of structure in
adaptation to changed conditions of life But the same thing may be seen
in hundreds and hundreds of other cases For instance to confine our
attention to the arm not only is the limb modified in the whale for
swimming but in another mammalthe batit is modified for flying by
having the fingers enormously elongated and overspread with a membranous
web In birds again the arm is modified for flight in a wholly
different waythe fingers here being very short and all run together
and the chief expanse of the wing being composed of the shoulder and
forearm In frogs and lizards again we find hands more like our own
but in an extinct species of flying reptile the modification was
extreme the wing having been formed by a prodigious elongation of the
fifth finger and a membrane spread over it and the rest of the hand
Lastly in serpents the hand and arm have disappeared altogether
Thus even if we confine our attention to a single structure how
wonderful are the modifications which it is seen to undergo although
never losing its typical character How are we to explain this By
design manifested in special creation or by descent with adaptive
modification If it is said by design manifested in special creation we
must suppose that the Deity formed an archetypal plan of certain
structures and that He determined to adhere to this plan through all
the modifications which those structures exhibit Now the difficulties
in the way of this supposition are prodigious if not quite
insurmountable In the first place why is it that some structures are
selected as typical and not others Why should the vertebral skeleton
for instance be tortured into every conceivable variety of modification
in order to make it serviceable for as great a variety of functions
while another structure such as the eye is made in different
subkingdoms on fundamentally different plans notwithstanding that it
has throughout to perform the same function Will any one have the
hardihood to assert that in the case of the skeleton the Deity has
endeavoured to show His ingenuity by the manifold functions to which
He has made the same structure subservient while in the case of the
eye He has endeavoured to show his resources by the manifold
structures which He has to subserve the same function If so it appears
to me a most unfortunate circumstance that throughout both the
vegetable and animal kingdoms all cases which can be pointed to as
showing ingenious adaptation of the same typical structure to the
performance of widely different functions are cases which come within
the limits of the same natural group of plants and animals and
therefore admit of being equally well explained by descent from a common
ancestry while all cases of widely different structures performing the
same function are to be found in different groups of plants or animals
and are therefore suggestive of independent variations arising in the
different lines of hereditary descent
To take a specific illustration The octopus or devilfish belongs to a
widely different class of animals from a true fish and yet its eye in
general appearance looks wonderfully like the eye of a true fish Now
Mr Mivart pointed to this fact as a great difficulty in the way of the
theory of evolution by natural selection because it must clearly be a
most improbable thing that so complicated a structure as the eye of a
fish should happen to be arrived at through each of two totally
different lines of descent And this difficulty would indeed be almost
fatal to the theory of evolution by natural selection if the apparent
similarity were a real one Unfortunately for the objection however
Mr Darwin clearly showed in his reply that in no one anatomical
feature of typical importance do the two structures resemble one
another so that in point of fact the two organs do not resemble one
another in any particular further than it is necessary that they should
if both are to serve as organs of sight But now suppose that this had
not been the case and that the two structures besides presenting the
necessary superficial resemblance had also presented an anatomical
resemblance with what tremendous force might it have then been
urgedYour hypothesis of hereditary descent with progressive
modification being here excluded by the fact that the animals compared
belong to two widely different branches of the tree of life how are we
to explain the identity of type manifested by these two complicated
organs of vision The only hypothesis open to us is intelligent
adherence to an ideal type But as this cannot now be urged in any one
case throughout the whole organic world we may on the other hand
present it as a most significant fact that while within the limits of
the same large branch of the tree of life we constantly find the same
typical structures modified so as to perform very different functions
we never find any vestige of these particular types of structure in
other large divisions of that tree In other words we never find
typical structures appearing except in cases where their presence may be
explained by the hypothesis of hereditary descent while in thousands of
such cases we find these structures undergoing every conceivable variety
of adaptive modification
Consequently special creationists must fall back upon another position
and sayWell but it may have pleased the Deity to form a certain
number of ideal types and never to allow the structures occurring in the
one type to appear in any of the others I answer undoubtedly it may
have done so but if it did it is a most unfortunate thing for your
theory for the fact implies that the Deity has planned His types in
such a way as to suggest the countertheory of descent For instance it
would seem to me a most capricious thing in the Deity to make the eyes
of an innumerable number of fish on exactly the same ideal type and
then to make the eye of the octopus so exactly like these other eyes in
superficial appearance as to deceive so accomplished a naturalist as Mr
Mivart and yet to take scrupulous care that in no one ideal particular
should this solitary eye resemble all the host of other eyes However
adopting for the sake of argument this gigantic assumption let us
suppose that God laid down these arbitrary rules for His own guidance in
creation and let us see to what it leads If as is assumed the Deity
formed a certain number of ideal types and determined that on no
account should He allow any part of one type to appear in any part of
another surely we should expect that within the limits of the same type
the same typical structures should always be present Thus remember
what desperate efforts so to speak there have been made to maintain
the uniformity of type in the case of the arm and should we not expect
that in other and similar cases similar efforts should be made Yet we
repeatedly find that this is not the case Even in the whale as we have
seen the hindlimbs are not apparent and it is impossible to see in
what respect the hindlimbs are of any less ideal value than the
forelimbs which as we have also seen are so carefully preserved in
nearly all vertebrated animals except the snakes where again we meet in
this particular with a sudden and sublime indifference to the
maintenance of a typical structure Now I say that if the theory of
ideal types is true we have in these facts evidence of the most
unreasonable inconsistency for no explanation can be assigned why so
much care should have been taken to maintain the type in some cases
while such reckless indifference should have been displayed towards
maintaining it in others But the theory of descent with continued
adaptive modification fully explains all the known cases for in every
