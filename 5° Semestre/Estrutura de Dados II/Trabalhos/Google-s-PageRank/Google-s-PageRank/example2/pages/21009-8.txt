once so that the reader if he finds or fancies a bias in the views to
be expressed in the sequel may know to what to attribute it
From the first symptoms of Secession to the surrender of the last
Southern army the writer has felt a vivid interest in the great
struggle and its issues and a thorough sympathy with the cause of the
North and alienation from that of the Southpoints on which he might
perhaps be more inclined to dilate were it not that at this late
hour of the day Northern adherency might read like the mere worship of
success So it is now but so it was not in many circles of English
society at least during the continuance of the war Almost up to the
very fall of Richmond to express a decisive adherence to the Northern
cause was often to be singular and solitary in a roomful of company the
timorous adherent would be minded to keep silence and the outspoken one
would be prepared for a stare and an embarrassed pause to ensue upon his
avowal At the same time that all his sympathies and hopes were for the
North the writer entertained opinions which forbade him to condemn the
South so far as the mere fact of secession and armed insurrection was
concerned To take a wide view of the question he apprehends that in
every fully constituted community there are two coextensive and
countervailing rights the right of the existent de facto government
to maintain itself by all legal and honorable means and if requisite
by the arbitrament of the sword and the right of any section of the
community to reorganize itself as it may see fit for its own interests
and to establish its independence by force of arms should nothing else
servethe sacred right of insurrection The insurgent party is not
to be decried for the mere act of resistance nor the loyal and
governmental party for the mere act of selfconservation and repression
of its opponents each stands the hazard of the die and commits its
cause to a supreme trial of strength If the American colonies of Great
Britain were not to be blamed for the mere act of resisting the
constituted authorities if the English Parliamentarians the French
Revolution the Polish Insurrection the Italian Wars of Independence
were justifiableand the writer thoroughly believes that they all were
sohe fails to see that the Southern States of the American Union were
necessarily in the wrong simply because they revolted from the Federal
authority And in each case he recognizes the coextensive right so far
as that alone is concerned of the existing government to assert itself
and stem the tide of revolt It is the old question of the Rights of Man
and the Mights of Man concerning which Carlyle has had so much to say
A trial between the Mights often throws considerable light upon the
question of the Rights and until at any rate the true Might has been
ascertained by this crucial test one may without halfheartedness admit
that both of the opposing Rights the conservative and the disruptive
are genuine rights mutually antagonistic and internecine but neither
disproved by the other
But this is only the most rudimentary view of the matter An abstract
and indefeasible right of insurrection may exist maintainable in any
and every case and yet a particular instance of insurrection maybe
foolish wicked and altogether worthy of ruin and extinction And the
writer believes that he is perfectly consistent with himself in thinking
both that the abstract right of insurrection existed in the case of the
Southern States of the Union and the abstract right of repression in the
Federal Government and also that this particular insurrection deserved
condemnation and failure and this particular repression deserved
credit and triumpha triumph which when the Mights of Men had been
sufficiently tested it very arduously and very conclusively managed to
achieve
As to the question of a legal and constitutional right of secession
the writer has not the impudence to expressand scarcely to
entertainan opinion That is a question for American lawyers and
publicists to discuss and determine the obfuscated British mind being
entitled to affirm only this that there seems to have been something to
say on the Southern side of the question as well as a good deal on the
Northern The writer apprehends that the abstract right of insurrection
on the one hand and of selfconservation on the other quite overbears
in so vast and momentous a debate the narrow technical legal
question that which it does not overbear is the rightness or wrongness
of the immediate motive conduct and aim of any particular insurrection
and repression considered individually The abstract rights remain the
same in all cases the application of those rights differs immeasurably
according to the merits of each several case
What were the merits of this particular case The constitutional
majority of the whole nation had elected a President whose election was
held by both parties to be tantamount to the policy of nonextension of
slavery into the Territories of the Republic and into all States to be
thereafter constructed and before the President elect had entered upon
his functions before a single subsisting legal right which might or
might not be a moral wrong had been interfered with while there was
yet no ground for affirming that any such right would ever be interfered
with the Southern States declared that their minority was of more
weight than the nations majority that they would break up the nation
rather than abide by its award and would themselves constitute a new
nation founded on the maintenance of slavery within their own borders
and its extension and propagation as opportunity might offer This and
not the mere fact that they were secessionists insurgents rebels or
whatever harder term may be forthcoming is the reason why the writer
disliked the revolt of the Southern States and wished it to come to
nought and corresponding facts regarding the Northern Statesthat
they were simply upholding a constitutional act performed by the nation
at large were contending for the majestic present and the magnificent
future of a great and free republic were arrayed against the extension
of slavery and might by the force of circumstances and the growth of
ideas find themselves called up even to exterminate the existing
slavesystemthese were the facts which commanded his homage to the
Northern causenot merely that they were the assertors of authority
against innovation The case as the writer understands it amounts
simply to this that the South seceded before it had been in any degree
damnified and to maintain a system the scotching or killing of which
though not in fact then contemplated by the North to any extent contrary
to existing laws would have been a benefit to mankind and an atonement
to human conscience It may perhaps seem superfluous or impertinent to
have given so many words to the statement of opinions so simple and
obvious But the English Liberal adherents of the Northern States were
continually twitted with their assumed inconsistency in censuring the
insurrection of the South while they approved of for instance the
insurrection of Lombardy against the Austrians and it seemed impossible
to get the objectors to understand or at any rate to acknowledge that
motives aims and consequences have some bearing upon revolts as upon
other transactions and that one may consistently abhor a revolt the
motive and aim of which he believes to be bad while he sympathizes with
another the motive and aim of which he believes to be good Of course
too there were other objectors who denied and will to this day not
blush to deny that the question of Slavery was the real substantial
incentive to secession and who paraded the minor questions of tariffs
the conflicting interests of the productive and the manufacturing
States and the like These arguments the writer leaves unfingered it
is no business of his to fray their delicate texture All he has to say
of them here is that as he does not value them at a pins fee as
representing the main point at issue they in no way affected the
feelings which he entertained concerning the war Again there were
remonstrants of a still more impracticable frame of mind who could see
the right absolute or potential of any despotic or constitutional
monarchy or any conquering power to suppress secession and revolt but
could not conceive that any similar right pertained to the central
government of a federative republic To hear them the will of a
national majority was of no account in a national issue provided the
majority of any particular State of the federation took the contrary
side The national majority had no rights such as the strong arm of the
law or the armed force ought to impose upon gainsayers it was only
the national minority which had such rights The latter might break up
the nation the former must not enforce any veto upon the disruption
Why elect a President as your governmental chief if you mean that
government should be a reality Why not be respectable like us
Europeans and have a King at once Such briefly interpreted appears
to have been the quintessence of the wisdom of these political sages
The writer has now done with the exposition of his own viewsof no
consequence assuredly to his American readers save for the clearer
understanding of what he has to say concerning the views entertained by
his British countryman at large He has also done with the few specimens
which it fell in his way to cite of objections urged against his
colleagues in opinion and which he was obtuse enough to imagine to be
no objections at all He proceeds to his main subjectthe varieties of
English opinion on the American War
These varieties may perhaps with some approach to completeness be
defined under the following seven heads
1st The party which believed in the sincerity the right and the
probable eventual success of the North
2d That which believed in the right of the North but which doubted or
disbelieved its sincerity especially on the question of Slavery or its
eventual success or both
3d That which cared only for the antislavery aspect of the contest
4th That which believed in the right and the probable eventual success
of the South
5th That which believed in the right of the South but which doubted or
disbelieved its eventual success
6th That which contrariwise believed in the eventual success of the
South but doubted or disbelieved its right
7th That which covertly or avowedly justified slavery
To each of these parties a few words of comment must be given
1st The party which believed in the sincerity the right and the
probable eventual success of the North was I think extremely small
during the greater part of the warsay between the first Battle of
Bull Run and the capture of Atlanta By sincerity I mean such points as
these that the Federal Government was honestly desirous of fulfilling
its obligations towards the South that the North having to maintain
the integrity of the country by force of arms was ready to make all
needful sacrifices for that object and to lavish its blood and
treasure above all that the professions of dislike to slavery the
offer of military emancipation to negroes and finally the efforts to
amend the Constitution so as to abolish slavery root and branch were
sincere Many of course believed in the right of the North and in one
of other of these items of sincerity few I think in the right in the
sincerity throughout and in the success as well The delusion that
the North after using up its Irish and German population and its
incoming immigrants would quail before the necessity of hazarding also
a large proportion of its own settled AngloSaxon population was
extremely prevalent Equally prevalent the notion that the North was
fighting merely for a constitutional idea or for national integrity
predominance or as Lord Russell phrased it for empire without any
real regard for the interests of the negro And when all these demands
upon ones faith had to be supplemented by a belief in the probable
success of the North few persons seemingly ventured to commit
themselves to the whole of the proposition Within my own personal
circle of observation I could name but one or at the utmost two
besides myself who in the main with some variations according to the
changing current of events clung to the cause of the North in its
entirety The first of these two persons is a painter of great
distinction and a man in other respects of very thinking and serious
mind well known by name and partially by his works to such Americans
as take an interest in fine art The second of the two is one of our
very greatest living poetsAs to the question of success the
following may perhaps be a tolerably fair account of the varying
impressions of many who along with myself hoped for the triumph of
the North and were disposed though not with any overwhelming
confidence to believe in it Up to the first Battle of Bull Run
opinion was suspended or fluctuating but in the main ones sympathies
conspired with ones information as to the comparative resources of the
opponents to produce a considerable degree of confidence That battle
and some other Southern successes acted as a severe check and
discouragement prevailed up to the time when the capture of New Orleans
Grants advance on the line of the Mississippi and McClellans On to
Richmond march righted the balance Great uncertainty however was
still felt and I should say that afterwards between the repulse of
McClellan and Pope and the Battle of Gettysburg most of the adherents
of the North were consciously hoping against hope and especially at
the time of the defeat at Chancellorsville and the Northern invasion by
Lee in 1863 were almost ready to confess the case desperateA
Gettysburg Vicksburg and Port Hudson altered the face of affairs and
revived a confidence which gradually strengthened almost into a
conviction such as not all the vast difficulties which afterwards beset
Grant in his advance towards Richmond nor all the nonsense of the Times
and other Southern journals about Johnston continuing to draw Sherman
from his base or Hood cutting him off from his communications and
compelling him to retreat by that most singular of retreating processes
the triumphal march through Georgia from end to end could ever avail
substantially to becloud Soon after the victory at Gettysburg those
who were not blinded by their wishes or preconceptions saw ground for
thinking that the South had made its greatest efforts and failedthe
North sustained its worst rebuffs and surmounted them
2d The party which believed in the right of the North but which
doubted or disbelieved its sincerity especially on the question of
Slavery or its eventual success or both was of necessity very
largeincluding as it did in a general way all the Northern
partisans whose strength and fulness of conviction were not great enough
to enroll them in my first division It is extremely difficult to form
an opinion or even a guess on the question of relative numbers but I
have always fancied that could the whole nation have been polled on
the subject the number of Northern wellwishers would have been found
sensibly to exceed that of the Southern Generally men of very grave
reflective and unprejudiced minds students in the philosophy of
society and history men known for their lofty ideal of liberty or of
culture appeared to be on the side of the North and the calm
unfaltering attitude free from petulance and invective of those
operative classes in Lancashire whom the war ruined for a while has
often been pointed to as showing that the more informed and intelligent
workingmen were also for the North They endured a great calamity
without murmuring because they thought the cause just which had
entailed that calamity upon them Assuming this to be correct as I
believe it to be the question remains What was the opinion or perhaps
one should rather say the sentiment of the class below thisthe great
numerical bulk of the population who would take sides according as
their sympathies imaginations prejudices or traditional conceptions
of the right might be roused irrespectively in the main of reasoning as
to any antecedents or consequences I incline to suppose that the most
powerful impulsion to the feelings of this class must have been that
strong antislavery sentiment which had undoubtedly for many years been
bone of the bone of Englishmenmore powerful even than that sympathy
for an overmatched struggle on behalf of independence which would have
pleaded for the South If this is a correct view it may be inferred
that the majority of the poorer classes was for the North as they
without refining over the question would regard the contest as one
between Slavery and Antislavery the latter represented by the North
and the former by the South Short however of some decided majority
for the North in these classes whose views do not transpire much upon
the surface of English opinion I fear the majority of the whole nation
would have been found to be with the South and could I take my own
sphere of society as the criterion I should be compelled to say that so
it was in overwhelming preponderance A more diffused connection with
America through the emigration movement and through community of
interest and feeling with a democratic nation may have combined with a
truer instinct of right in the popular heart to rectify the balance and
in default of evidence to the contrary I am fain to suppose it didA
few words must be added as to one branch of our immediate subjectthe
doubt or disbelief of the sincerity of the North on the question of
Slavery Had no prejudice or perversity of argument been imported into
the subject it would I imagine have been apparent to most of my
countrymen that the dominant party at the North was genuinely
antagonistic to slavery that as long as the South did not violate the
Federal Constitution the North was trammelled from interfering with
slavery as already established by law in certain States that the duty
immediately imposed upon the North and the Government by the act of
Secession was one and undividedthe maintenance of the Constitution
and of the Union but that in proportion to the obstinacy of Southern
resistance the antagonism to slavery would obtain free play in the
North the slavery question would assume greater and greater prominence
as the nexus of the whole debate and those who had at first been
bound to make a stand for an extant Union and compromise would be
impelled and more than willing to fight on for reunion and abolition
But this view of the matter was consistently distorted The
constitutionalism and nationalism of the North figured in argument as
indifference to slavery the steps taken towards the emancipation of
slaves as mere hypocritical stratagems of war and the climax of
disingenuousness was reached when the anticonscription and antinegro
riots of New York were fastened upon that very warparty against which
they had been levelled Systematic misrepresentations of this nature
invidious glosses and plausible misconstructions did undoubtedly
conspire with the really complicated conditions of the case and the
undisputed fact of certain antipathies of race predicable as truly of
the Northern States as of any other part of the world to persuade very
many Englishmen that the North was not sincerely hostile to slavery but
used the Antislavery or the Abolition cry as a mere feint to disguise
the lust of domination Those who liked to be persuaded of this were
persuaded with the utmost ease and even among men who considered the
subject without bias many were confused and shaken
3d The party which cared only for the antislavery aspect of the
contest was large Their attitude is to a certain extent indicated in
what has just been said One and not an insignificant section of them
would have sided frankly with the North if satisfied that the Northern
triumph would be an antislavery triumph but talked as they were or
talking themselves into the belief that slavery had little more to fear
from the North than the South they remained at least during the
earlier part of the war indifferent or indignant Others of course the
great majority watched eagerly every symptom and every step which
proved the North to be in earnest in the work of abolition they
thrilled to the sounds which proclaimed liberty to the captivethe
tones of Northern manifestoes and legislation the tread of Northern
legions and the volleys fired by negro soldiers They got to feel a
genuine veneration and even enthusiasm for President Lincoln and formed
probably the only section of men or women in this country who could
speak of General Butler without bringing railing accusations The
party was diffused over the length and breadth of the land It numbered
I suppose some adherents even in the aristocratic and governing
classesthousands no doubt among the working and laboring millions
but its central strength was in that backbone of English philanthropic
effort the more plebeian section of the welltodo middle classthat
section which gravitates towards Dissent in religion towards
Radicalism in politics towards Bible Societies Temperance Movements
Bands of Hope and Exeter Hall If this section of the British
community had not remained true to antislavery ideas the country would
indeed have been turned the seamy side without That we were spared
in the severer crises of the war the last uglinesses of tergiversation
is owing mainly to people of this class the cheapest subjects for
wellbred sneers and intellectual superiority in ordinary times
4th The party which believed in the right and the probable eventual
success of the South was obviously during the greater part of the war
a numerous one In the earlier stages of Secession when the chief
question before ones thoughts was that of right I think that
comparatively few people sided with the South though very many were
lukewarm or frigid or actually inimical towards the North At that time
partyspirit still respected the oldfashioned notions that a
selfgoverning nation must be ruled by its own majority not minority
that a minority which cried out before it was hurt and cut the
connection rather than the balance in its own favor was likely to be a
factious and misguided minority and that a new commonwealth whose
raison detre was Slavery had little claim to the sympathies of
Englishmen or of civilization Others laid greater stress from the first
on the argument that the States of the Union were all sovereign states
which had respectively entered into a voluntary bond and could
voluntarily withdraw from it without gainsaying and that this ground of
right on the side of the South remained unaffected by any accessory
considerations This view rapidly gained over the willing convictions of
Southern sympathizers when the impulse and determination the courage
and early successes of the South had once roused strong feelings in its
favor The earlier argumentative view as to majorities and minorities
and the fundamental basis of all governments sank into desuetude while
the right of a compact community to independent selfgovernment at its
own option occupied the field of vision Vast numbers of peopleI
should think during the greater part of the war four fifths of the
whole countrybelieved in the success of the South considering it
impossible that so determined a community with so vast a territory
should ever be coerced into reunion and not being prepared for an equal
amount of determination on the part of the Northern Government and
people or for their capacity even had the will been admitted to meet
the required outlay in money and men Another question too was
prominent in mens minds and indisposed them to contemplating a
subjugated South They would ask What is to be done with the South on
the unlikely supposition of its being conquered Is it to become an
American Poland All these considerations inclined the great majority
of the nation to believe that the South would succeed and of those who
so believed a large proportion held the Southerners to be in the right
or sympathized with them to a degree which obscured the strict question
of right in favor of preference
5th The party which believed in the right of the South but which
doubted or disbelieved its eventual success appears to me to have been
most inconsiderable up to the final stages of the war I doubt whether I
ever met two men prior let me say to Shermans march through Georgia
who would distinctly limit themselves to this I wish the South might
succeed but I dont think it will When the impending catastrophe of
the South was no longer disputable the Saturday Review the idol of our
Clubmen and Universitymen of those who are at once highly cultivated
and intensely English and who fancy themselves freer from prejudice and
more largeminded than others in proportion to their incapacity to
perceive that their own prejudices are prejudicesa paper which had
gone in for the South with a vehemence only balanced by its virulence
against the Northfound it convenient to turn tail and retort upon
those opponents with whom the laugh remained at last The Saturday
Review bleated pitifully yet unconfessingly to this effectTrue it
is that we have been backing up the South all the while but we meant no
more by it than the backer of any prizefighter or any racehorse means
when he has made his choice and staked his money and shouts to adopted
competitor Go in and win That backer does not necessarily believe
that his side will be the winner but only signalizes that that side
is his The evasion came too late persons who had inconvenient
memories saw through the shuffling of a pseudoprophet who only managed
to cast a retrospective gleam of insincerity over his fortunetelling
to convert blunder into bad faith and to stultify his present along
with his past position The leek had to be eaten at last why after so
many prave ords of superiority and defiance confess that the eating
of it had been more than half foreseen all along
6th The party which believed in the eventual success of the South but
doubted or disbelieved its right must have been pretty considerable if
my previous estimates are true for I have already advanced the
conjecture that more than half the nation sided with the North while
four fifths believed for a long time in the success of the South This
fact alone if correctly alleged furnishes tolerable evidence of the
persistency and influence of proSouthern papers and partisans and
their ingenuity in so misreading the facts
Che il no e il si nel capo ci tenzona
The event has proved that the chances of success were really very much
on the side of the North The superiority in material resources and
certain solid and undeniable successes obtained at and early stage of
the war such as the capture of New Orleans were known to be on the
same side Slighter grounds would in most cases have sufficed to
persuade minds predisposed by sympathy that this side would win yet the
Southern advocates shuffled and played the cards well enough to induce
an opposite conclusion in numerous instances And no doubt many who
began by simply believing that the South would succeed went on to think
that the North deserved to losepartly because upon such an
assumption the personal superiority must have been very largely with
the South and partly because a combatant who has no fair chance of
winning ought to give in and not persist in shedding blood in vain If
a big man fights a little one and turns out upon experiment to have
next to no chance of beating him one soon gets angry with the big one
for pegging away even though one may at first have perceived him to
be in the right Such seemed to many English observers to be the
condition of the case in America They were mistaken but excusable but
for the error in their premise their deduction would have been correct
or at least not irrational
7th The party which covertly or avowedly justified slavery was
incomparably larger than any Englishman would have dreamed of a week
before the secession took place Till then I doubt whether any writer
of credit except one had ventured deliberately to affirm that American
slavery is under limitations an allowable and advantageous thing That
exception is assuredly a most illustrious one perhaps the strongest
head and stoutest heart in the British dominions and our living writer
of the most exalted and durable fameThomas Carlyle His Occasional
Discourse on the Nigger Question published some years ago ruffled and
outraged the antislavery mind which then and for some while before
and since might fairly be termed the mind of all England That
Discourse staggered some readers and roused othersroused them to
contemplate the whole question from a more fundamental and actual a
less traditional and prejudged point of view than had been in vogue
since our own abolition movement gained the ascendency It became
apparent to various thinkers that the humanitarian view of the question
was not its beall and endall that some facts and considerations per
contra had to be taken into account and that what one train of thought
and feeling denounced as a mere selfcondemned wrong might according to
another be even regarded as a higher right Still this new light
upon slavery was received more or less fully by only a very few minds
as compared with the general mass of British convictiona few
thoroughgoing believers in Carlyle a few hardy and openminded
speculators hardly more perhaps in all than those who would join Mr
John Stuart Mill in saying that the right form of Parliamentary suffrage
is universal suffrage open to women as well as men No ordinary English
newspaper would have thought of professing at that time nor any
ordinary English reader of tolerating the theory that slavery is right
It is no part of my plan or business to discuss this question of
slavery I will simply say to avoid misapprehension that while
recognizing the profound good sense of much that Carlyle has said on
this and cognate matters my own instinct of right and habits of opinion
rebel against the proslavery theory and never allowed me to doubt
which side I was on when the question came to its supreme practical
issue in the civil war Such then appears to me to have been the
state of English opinion on this subject when the secession occurred On
one ground or another a large proportion of our population and our
writers sided with the South At first I fancy that no journal and no
average Englishman affirmed that slavery is justifiable but as events
progressed it became more and more difficult to say that the South was
right and yet that slavery was wrong No man can serve two masters
not even such a couple as Jefferson Davis and Wilberforce The British
sympathizers who had determined to hold to the one were reduced to
the logical necessity of despising the other It was a surprising
spectacle The dogmas and traditions of half a century snapped like
threads when it became their office to constrain a penchant
Ethnologists and politicians were equally ready to find out that the
negro was fit for nothing but enforced servitude Parsons
marchionesses and maiden aunts received simultaneous enlightenment as
to Christian truth and discovered that slavery was not prohibited but
was even countenanced in the Bible The inference was inevitable what
Moses did not condemn in Jews thirtythree centuries ago must be the
correct thing for AngloAmericans to uphold at the present day Did not
St Paul tell Onesimus to return to his master etc etc Many
Secessionist organs of public opinion no doubt declined to commit
themselves to proslavery views they started with the assumption that
slavery is an evil and a crime and they continued protesting the same
creed How far this creed was compatible with so rabid an advocacy of
the Southern causehow far it was possible for genuine abominators of
slavery to continue unfaltering their Southern palinodes and Northern
anathemas after such acts on the part of the South as the refusal to
include colored troops among exchangeable prisoners of war and the
massacre at Fort Pillow and such acts on the part of the North as the
Emancipation Proclamation and the introduction of the Constitutional
Amendment for abolitionthese are questions which appear deserving of
an answer yet one may be quite prepared to find that the spirit of
party which made such an anomaly possible is blind to the fact of its
being anomalous and has an answer pat My own belief about the matter
is this When the Secession began there were two sects among the
English partisans of the South the Carlylese apologists of slaverya
very small sect and the political advocates of Secession who partly
with full conviction partly as a mere matter of unchallenged use and
wont repudiated slaverya very large sect The Southern partisanship
of the former sect was perfectly logical that of the latter unable to
stand the wear and tear of discussion as the progress of events made it
more and more manifest that slavery or abolition was the real issue
With this latter sect the political or other liking for the South was a
much stronger and more active feeling than the humanitarian or other
dislike of slavery the first feeling indeed soon developed into a
passion the second into a selfreproachful obstruction Thus the
logical view that slavery as well as the slaveholding interest was
right exercised a powerful centripetal attraction and many minds were
