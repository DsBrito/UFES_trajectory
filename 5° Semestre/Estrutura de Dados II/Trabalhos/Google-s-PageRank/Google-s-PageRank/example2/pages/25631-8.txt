When I wrote the following pages some years back at Oak Lodge as a
pastime I did not think it would be of service to my fellowcreatures
for our suffering soldiers the sick wounded and needy who have so
nobly fought our countrys cause to maintain the flag of our great
Republic and to prove among Nations that a Free Republic is not a myth
With these few words I dedicate this book to the SANITARY FAIR to be
held in Philadelphia June 1864
March 1864
Through tomes of fable and of dream
I sought an eligible theme
But none I found or found them shared
Already by some happier bard
Till settling on the current year
I found the farsought treasure near
A theme for poetry you see
A theme t ennoble even me
In memorable fortythree
Oh Dick you may talk of your writing and reading
Your logic and Greek but there is nothing like feeding
MOORE
Upon singing and cookery Bobby of course
Standing up for the latter Fine Art in full force
MOORE
Are these the choice dishes the Doctor has sent us
Heaven sends us good meats but the Devil sends cooks
That my life like the German may be
Du lit a la table de la table au litMOORE
TO THE READER
Though cooks are often men of pregnant wit
Through niceness of their subject few have writ
Tis a sage question if the art of cooks
Is lodgd by nature or attaind by books
That man will never frame a noble treat
Whose whole dependence lies in some receipt
Then by pure nature everything is spoild
She knows no more than stewd bakd roast and boild
When art and nature join the effect will be
Some nice ragout or charming fricasee
What earth and waters breed or air inspires
Man for his palate fits by torturing fires
But though my edge be not too nicely set
Yet I anothers appetite may whet
May teach him when to buy when seasons passd
Whats stale what choice what plentiful what waste
And lead him through the various maze of taste
The fundamental principle of all
Is what ingenious cooks the relish call
For when the market sends in loads of food
They all are tasteless till that makes them good
Besides tis no ignoble piece of care
To know for whom it is you would prepare
Youd please a friend or reconcile a brother
A testy father or a haughty mother
Would mollify a judge would cram a squire
Or else some smiles from court you would desire
Or would perhaps some hasty supper give
To show the splendid state in which you live
Pursuant to that interest you propose
Must all your wines and all your meat be chose
Tables should be like pictures to the sight
Some dishes cast in shade some spread in light
Some at a distance brighten some near hand
Where ease may all their delicace command
Some should be moved when broken others last
Through the whole treat incentive to the taste
Locket by many labors feeble grown
Up from the kitchen calld his eldest son
Though wise thyself says he though taught by me
Yet fix this sentence in thy memory
There are some certain things that dont excel
And yet we say are tolerably well
Theres many worthy men a lawyer prize
Whom they distinguish as of middle size
For pleading well at bar or turning books
But this is not my son the fate of cooks
From whose mysterious art true pleasure springs
To stall of garters and to throne of kings
A simple scene a disobliging song
Which no way to the main design belong
Or were they absent never would be missd
Have made a wellwrought comedy be hissd
So in a feast no intermediate fault
Will be allowd but if not best tis nought
If you perhaps would try some dish unknown
Which more peculiarly youd make your own
Like ancient sailors still regard the coast
By venturing out too far you may be lost
By roasting that which your forefathers boild
And broiling what they roasted much is spoild
That cook to American palates is complete
Whose savory hand gives turn to common meat
Far from your parlor have your kitchen placed
Dainties may in their working be disgraced
In private draw your poultry clean your tripe
And from your eels their slimy substance wipe
Let cruel offices be done by night
For they who like the thing abhor the sight
Tis by his cleanliness a cook must please
A kitchen will admit of no disease
Were Horace that great master now alive
A feast with wit and judgment hed contrive
As thus Supposing that you would rehearse
A labord work and every dish a verse
Hed say Mend this and tother line and this
If after trial it were still amiss
Hed bid you give it a new turn of face
Or set some dish more curious in its place
If you persist he would not strive to move
A passion so delightful as selflove
Cooks garnish out some tables some they fill
Or in a prudent mixture show their skill
Clog not your constant meals for dishes few
Increase the appetite when choice and new
Een they who will extravagance profess
Have still an inward hatred for excess
Meat forced too much untouchd at table lies
Few care for carving trifles in disguise
Or that fantastic dish some call surprise
When pleasures to the eye and palate meet
That cook has renderd his great work complete
His glory far like sirloin knighthoodxi1 flies
Immortal made as Kitcat by his pies
Next let discretion moderate your cost
And when you treat three courses be the most
Let never fresh machines your pastry try
Unless grandees or magistrates are by
Then you may put a dwarf into a piexi2
Crowd not your table let your number be
Not more than seven and never less than three
Tis the dessert that graces all the feast
For an ill end disparages the rest
A thousand things well done and one forgot
Defaces obligation by that blot
Make your transparent sweetmeats truly nice
With Indian sugar and Arabian spice
And let your various creams encircled be
With swelling fruit just ravishd from the tree
The feast now done discourses are renewed
And witty arguments with mirth pursued
The cheerful master midst his jovial friends
His glass to their best wishes recommends
The grace cup follows To the Presidents health
And to the country Plenty Peace and Wealth
Performing then the piety of grace
Each man that pleases reassumes his place
While at his gate from such abundant store
He showers his godlike blessings on the poor

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS
FOR THE USE OF THE
MISTRESS OF A FAMILY
The mistress of a family should always remember that the welfare and
good management of the house depend on the eye of the superior and
consequently that nothing is too trifling for her notice whereby waste
may be avoided
Many families have owed their prosperity full as much to the conduct and
propriety of female arrangement as to the knowledge and activity of the
father
All things likely to be wanted should be in readinesssugars of
different qualities should be broken currants washed picked and dry in
a jar spice pounded c Every article should be kept in that place
best suited to it as much waste may thereby be avoided Vegetables
will keep best on a stone floor if the air be excluded Dried meats
hams c the same All sorts of seeds for puddings rice c should
be closecovered to preserve from insects Flour should be kept in a
cool perfectly dry room and the bag being tied should be changed
upside down and back every week and well shaken Carrots parsnips and
beetroots should be kept in sand for winter use and neither they nor
potatoes be cleared from the earth Store onions preserve best hung up
in a dry room Straw to lay apples on should be quite dry to prevent a
musty taste Tarragon gives the flavor of French cookery and in high
gravies should be added only a short time before serving
Basil savory and knotted marjoram or London thyme to be used when
herbs are ordered but with discretion as they are very pungent
Celery seeds give the flavor of the plant to soups Parsley should be
cut close to the stalks and dried on tins in a very cool oven it
preserves its flavor and color and is very useful in winter Artichoke
bottoms which have been slowly dried should be kept in paper bags and
truffles lemonpeel c in a very dry place ticketed
Pickles and sweetmeats should be preserved from air where the former
are much used small jars of each should be taken from the stockjar to
prevent frequent opening
Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should be pared first to
preserve the peel dry some should be halved and when squeezed the
pulp cut out and the outsides dried for grating
If for boiling any liquid the first way is best When whites of eggs
are used for jelly or other purposes contrive to have pudding
custards c to employ the yolks also
Gravies or soups put by should be daily changed into fresh scalded
pans
If chocolate coffee jelly gruel bark c be suffered to boil over
the strength is lost
The cook should be charged to take care of jelly bags tapes for the
collared things c which if not perfectly scalded and kept dry give
an unpleasant flavor when next used
Hard water spoils the color of vegetables a pinch of pearlash or salt
of wormwood will prevent that effect
When sirloins of beef loins of veal or mutton come in part of the suet
may be cut off for puddings or to clarify dripping will baste
everything as well as butter fowls and game excepted and for kitchen
pies nothing else should be used
Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched should be soaked in cold
water two or three hours before they are used or more if much iced
when put into hot water or to the fire until thawed no heat will
dress them properly
Meat should be well examined when it comes in in warm weather In the
height of the summer it is a very safe way to let meat that is to be
salted lie an hour in cold water then wipe it perfectly dry and have
ready salt and rub it thoroughly into every part leaving a handful
over it besides Turn it every day and rub the pickle in which will
make it ready for the table in three or four days if it is desired to
be very much corned wrap it in a wellfloured cloth having rubbed it
previously with salt The latter method will corn fresh beef fit for
table the day it comes in but it must be put into the pot when the
water boils
If the weather permits meat eats much better for hanging two or three
days before it be salted
The water in which meat has been boiled makes an excellent soup for the
poor when vegetables oatmeal or peas are added and should not be
cleared from the fat Roast beef bones or shank bones of ham make fine
peas soup and should be boiled with the peas the day before eaten that
the fat may be removed The mistress of the house will find many great
advantages in visiting her larder daily before she orders the bill of
fare she will see what things require dressing and thereby guard
against their being spoiled Many articles may be redressed in a
different form from that in which they are first served an improve the
appearance of the table without increasing the expense
In every sort of provisions the best of the kind goes farthest cutting
out most advantageously and affording most nourishment
Round of beef fillet of veal and leg of mutton bear a higher price
but having more solid meat deserve the preference It is worth notice
however that those joints which are inferior may be dressed as
palatably and being cheaper ought to be bought in turn and when
weighed with the prime pieces the price of the latter is reduced
In loins of meat the long pipe which runs by the bone should be taken
out being apt to taint as likewise the kernels of beef
Rumps and aitch bones of beef are often bruised by the blows the drovers
give and that part always taints avoid purchasing such
The shank bones of mutton should be saved and after soaking and
bruising may be added to give richness to gravies and soups and they
are particularly nourishing for the sick
Calves tongues salted make a more useful dish than when dressed with
the brains which may be served without
Some people like neats tongues cured with the root in which case they
look much larger but should the contrary be approved the root must be
cut off close to the gullet next to the tongue but without taking away
the fat under the tongue The root must be soaked in salt and water and
extremely well cleaned before it be dressed and the tongue laid in salt
for a night and day before pickled
Great attention is requisite in salting meat and in the country where
great quantities are cured it is of still more importance Beef and
pork should be well sprinkled and a few hours after hung to drain
before it be rubbed with the preserving salts which mode by cleansing
the meat from the blood tends to keep it from tasting strong it should
be turned daily and if wanted soon rubbed A salting tub may be used
and a cover should fit close Those who use a good deal of salt will
find it well to boil up the pickle skim and when cold pour it over
meat that has been sprinkled and drained In some families great loss is
sustained by the spoiling of meat If meat is brought from a distance in
warm weather the butcher should be charged to cover it close and bring
it early in the morning
Mutton will keep long by washing with vinegar the broad end of the leg
if any damp appears wipe it immediately If rubbed with salt lightly
it will not eat the worse Game is brought in when not likely to keep a
day in the cooks apprehension yet may be preserved two or three days
if wanted by the following method
If birds woodcocks and snipes excepted which must not be drawn draw
them pick and take out the crop wash them in two or three waters and
rub them with a little salt Have ready a large saucepan of boiling
water put the birds in it and let them remain five minutes moving it
that it may go through them When all are finished hang them by the
heads in a cold place when drained pepper the inside and necks when
to be roasted wash to take off the pepper The most delicate birds
even grouse may be kept this way if not putrid
Birds that live by suction c bear being high it is probable that
the heat might cause them to taint more as a free passage for the
scalding water could not be obtained
Freshwater fish has often a muddy taste to take off which soak it in
strong salt and water or if of a size to bear it give it a scald in
the same after extremely good cleaning and washing
In the following and indeed all other receipts though the quantities
may be as accurately set down as possible yet much must be left to the
discretion of the persons who use them
The different taste of people requires more or less of the flavor of
spices garlic butter c which can never be directed by general
rules and if the cook has not a good taste and attention to that of
her employers not all the ingredients with which nature or art can
furnish her will give an exquisite relish to her dishes
The proper articles should be at hand and she must proportion them
until the true zest be obtained

SOUPS
TURTLE SOUP
Sons of Apicius say can Europes seas
Can aught the edible creation yield
Compare with turtle boast of land and wave
GRAINGER
And zounds who would grudge
Turtle soup though it came to five guineas the bowl
MOORE
The day before you dress a turtle chop the herbs and make the
forcemeat then on the preceding evening suspend the turtle by the two
hind fins with a cord and put one round the neck with a heavy weight
attached to it to draw out the neck that the head may be cut off with
more ease let the turtle hang all night in which time the blood will
be well drained from the body Then early in the morning having your
stoves and plenty of hot water in readiness take the turtle lay it on
the table on its back and with a strong pointed knife cut round the
under shell which is the callipeethere are joints at each end
which must be carefully foundgently separating it from the callipash
which is the upper shell be careful that in cutting out the gut you
do not break the gall When the callipee and the callipash are perfectly
separated take out that part of the gut that leads from the throat
that with the hearts put into a basin of water by themselves the other
interior part put away Take the callipee and cut off the meat which
adheres to it in four quarters laying it on a clean dish Take twenty
pounds of veal chop it up and set it in a large pot as directed for
espagnoles putting in the flesh of the turtle at the same time with
all kinds of turtle herbs carrots onions one pound and a half of lean
ham peppercorns salt and a little spice and two bay leaves leaving
it to stew till it take the color of espagnole put the finsthe skin
scalded offand hearts in half an hour before you fill it with half
water and half beef stock then carefully skim it put in a bunch of
parsley and let it boil gently like consomme While the turtle is
stewing carefully scald the head the callipee and all that is soft of
the callipash attentively observing to take off the smallest skin that
may remain put them with the gut into a large pot of water to boil till
tender when so take them out and cut them in squares putting them in
a basin by themselves till wanted for the soup The next thing is the
thickening of the soup which must be prepared in the same manner as
sauce tournee The turtle being well done take out the fins and hearts
and lay them on a dish the whole of the liquor must pass through a
sieve into a large pan then with a ladle take off all the fat put it
into a basin then mix in the turtle liquor a small quantity at a
time with the thickening made the same as tournee but it does not
require to neither must it be onetwentieth part as thick Set it over
a brisk fire and continue stirring till it boils When it has boiled
gently for one hour put in the callipee and callipash with the guts
hearts and some of the best of the meat and head all cut in squares
with the forcemeat balls and herbs which you should have ready chopped
and stewed in espagnole the herbs and parsley lemon thyme marjoram
basil savory and a few chopped mushrooms
It must be carefully attended to and skimmed and one hour and a half
before dinner put in a bottle of Madeira wine and nearly half a bottle
of brandy keeping it continually boiling gently and skimming it then
take a basin put a little cayenne into it with the juice of six lemons
squeezed through a sieve When the dinner is wanted skim the turtle
stir it well up and put a little salt if necessary then stir the
cayenne and lemon juice in and ladle it into the tureen This receipt
will answer for a turtle between fifty and sixty pounds
CHICKEN BROTH
The chicken broth was brought at nine
He then arose to ham and wine
And with a philosophic air
Decided on the bill of fare
Take the remaining parts of a chicken from which panada has been made
all but the rump skin and put them into the water it was first boiled
in with the addition of a little mace onion and a few peppercorns
and simmer it When of a good flavor put to it a quarter of an ounce of
sweet almond beaten with a spoonful of water boil it a little while
and when cold take off the fat
FISH
TO STEW FISH WHITE
His soup scientifichis fishes quite prime
His pates superb and his cutlets sublime

onions and parsley root boil them in a pint of water cut your fish in
pieces to suit take some clever sized pieces cut them from the bone

yolk of an egg well beaten together teaspoonful of flour mix it
gradually with half a pint of the water the fish was done in then with
all your water put in your balls let it boil very quick when done

ANOTHER WAY TO STEW FISH
Behold the dishes due appear
Fish in the van beef in the rear

With scalding sauce
Boil six onions in water till tender strain and cut them in slices
Put your fish cut in slices in a stewpan with a quart of water salt
pepper ginger and mace to suit taste let it boil fifteen minutes add
the onions and forcemeat balls made of chopped fish grated bread
chopped onion parsley marjoram mace pepper ginger and salt and

and then add six eggs with the juice of five lemons stir the gravy very
slowly add chopped parsley and let it all simmer on a slow fire
keeping the pan in motion until it just boils when it must be taken off
quickly or the sauce will break A little butter or sweet oil added to
the balls is an improvement If you meet with good success in the
cooking of this receipt you will often have stewed fish
PERCH WITH WINE
Here haddock hake and flounders are
And eels and perch and cod
GREEN
Having scalded and taken out the gills put the perch into a stewpan

them with parsleyroot cut in long thin slices in half a teacup of
sweet oil till they become a fine brown Wash and dry your fish cut it

lay it nicely on a dish mix a little flour in your gravy give it a
boil throw it over the fish and let it stand to cool
ROASTED STURGEON
Your betters will despise you if they see
Things that are far surpassing your degree
Therefore beyond your substance never treat
Tis plenty in small fortune to be neat
A widow has cold pie nurse gives you cake
From generous merchants ham or sturgeon take
KING
Take a large piece of sturgeon or a whole small one clean and skin it
properly lard it with eel and anchovies and marinade it in a white
wine marmalade Fasten it to the spit and roast it basting frequently
with the marinade strained Let the fish be a nice color and serve with
a pepper sauce
BOILED SALMON
Red speckled trouts the salmons silver jole
The jointed lobster and unscaly sole
And luscious scallops to allure the tastes
Of rigid zealots to delicious feasts
Wednesdays and Fridays youll observe from hence
Days when our sins were doomed to abstinence
GAY
Put on a fishkettle with spring water enough to well cover the salmon
you are going to dress or the salmon will neither look nor taste well
boil the liver in a separate saucepan When the water boils put in a
handful of salt take off the scum as soon as it rises have the fish
well washed put it in and if it is thick let it boil very gently
Salmon requires as much boiling as meat about a quarter of an hour to a
pound of meat but practice can only perfect the cook in dressing
salmon
A quarter of a salmon will take as long boiling as half a one You must
consider the thickness not the weight
Obs The thinnest part of the fish is the fattest and if you have a
grand gourmand at table ask him if he is for thick or thin
Lobster sauce and rye bread should be eaten with boiled salmon
BOILED LOBSTER
But soon like lobster boild the morn
From black to red began to turn
BUTLER
Those of the middle size are best The male lobster is preferred to eat
and the female to make sauce of Set on a pot with water salted in
proportion of a tablespoonful of salt to a quart of water When the
water boils put it in and keep it boiling briskly from half an hour to
an hour according to its size wipe all the scum off it and rub the
shell with a little butter or sweet oil break off the great claws
crack them carefully in each joint so that they may not be shattered
and yet come to pieces easily cut the tail down the middle and send
the body whole
OYSTERS
The man had sure a palate coverd oer
With brass or steel that on the rocky shore
First broke the oozy oysters pearly coat
And riskd the living morsel down his throat
GAY
Common people are indifferent about the manner of opening oysters and
the time of eating them after they are opened Nothing however is
more important in the enlightened eyes of the experienced oystereater
Those who wish to enjoy this delicious restorative in its utmost
perfection must eat it the moment it is opened with its own gravy in
the under shell If not eaten while absolutely alive its flavor and
spirit are lost
FRIED OYSTERS
You shapeless nothing in a dish
You that are but almost a fish
COWPER
The largest and finest oysters should be chosen for frying Simmer them
in their own liquor for a couple of minutes take them out and lay them
