Columbia SC
A SON OF SLAVES CLIMBS UP
The Rev John B Elliott ABA AM DD 1315 Liberty Hill Avenue
Columbia SC is the son of slaves He was born at Mount Olive NC
in 1869 and missed being a slave by only four years His college
degrees were won at Shaw University Raleigh NC and the degree of
Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by Allen University of Columbia
SC
Sitting on the parsonage piazza recently the Rector of St Annas
Episcopal Church talked about his struggle for education and his labors
up from slavery
I was born at Mount Olive NC the son of Soloman Elliott and Alice
Roberts Elliott They were slaves when they married and I escaped
bondage by only four years since slaves were not freed in the South
until 1865
My father was owned by Robert W Williams of Mount Olive and he was
the most highly prized Negro in the vicinity He was a natural carpenter
and builder Often he would go to the woods and pick out trees for the
job in hand Some of the houses he built there are standing today
Mother was equally trained and well equipped to make a home and keep it
neat and clean When they were free in 1865 half the community was
eager to employ them and pay them well for their services And when I
came along they were living in their own house and prospering
I chose a religious career when quite a boy and when I was ready for
college I was much pleased I finished at Shaw University at Raleigh
took a years study at Columbia University in New York and then finished
a religious course at the Bishop Payne Divinity School at Petersburg
Virginia where most of the colored clergymen of the Episcopal Church
are finished After I felt that I was fairly well fitted to begin my
clerical work I chose South Carolina as my field
My first assignment was at Waccamaw Neck a little below Georgetown
SC and a big industrial center There the Negro population is keen
for wine and whiskey One of the men whom I was interested in was
pretty tipsy when I called and as I sat and talked with him he said
Youre drunk too This surprised me and I asked him why he thought
so Well you got your vest and collar on backwards so you must be
drunk
Since I have had pastorates at Aiken Peak Rock Hill and Walterboro
From Walterboro I came to Columbia as pastor of St Annas Episcopal
Church and the missions of Anns at New Brookland and St Thomas at
Eastover I presume I have done pretty well in this field since the Rt
Rev Bishop Kirkman G Finlay DD appointed me archdeacon for Negro
work in upper South Carolina
As I was coming away from the Bishops office I was accompanied by
another colored rector who had very short legs I am six feet four
inches in height and he looked up at me as we walked along and asked
quizzically How long should a mans legs be I smiled and told him I
thought perhaps every man should have legs long enough to reach to the
ground Yes of course we laughed at each other but my argument won
because Bishop Finlay is about six feet three inches and I told my
short friend When Bishop Finlay and I talk we are able to look each
other in the eye on the level
I married Susan McMahan a colored school teacher and the Lord has
blessed us with a son John B Jr a fine woodworker like his
grandfather was and two sweet daughters Alice the older one is a
teacher in the public schools of Columbia and Annie is a student Our
home life has always been pleasant and unusually sunny
I had one very humorous experience three years ago when I was invited
to deliver an address near Mount Olive NC to a convention of young
people Arriving about 10 oclock that day I was met by a citizen who
told me he was assigned to introduce me that evening As we rode along
I cautioned him not to boost me too highly He said little
When the big and I may say expectant audience was seated that night
he arose and seemed much embarrassed ultimately saying Ladies and
gentlemen I have an unpleasant duty to perform this evening Then
pointing at me he went on I dont know this man much Fact is I
only know two things about him One is he has never been in jail and
the other is I never could figure why
No I am not related to the late Robert Bruce Elliott by ties of
consanguinity He was successively twice a member of Congress from South
Carolina and a member and Speaker of the South Carolina House of
Representatives in 1876 Perhaps these honors came to him because he had
a good education before he met the opportunity for service
When I think of the 60s70s period I am surprised that recent
slaves suddenly placed in administrative positions of honor and trust
did as well as they did
In the seventytwo years since slavery I have noted much improvement
along the road and I am sure that our nation has far less discord now
than it had when I was a small lad And when one can note progress in
our march toward the light I guess that ought to be sufficient for my
optimism

EXSLAVE STORIES
EMANUEL ELMORE
I was born on June 20th and I remember when the war broke out for I
was about five years old We lived in Spartanburg County not far from
old Cherokee ford My father was Emanuel Elmore and he lived to be
about 90 years old
My marster was called by everybody Col Elmore and that is all that I
can remember about his name When he went to the war I wanted to go with
him but I was too little He joined the Spartanburg Sharp Shooters
They had a drill ground near the Falls My pa took me to see them drill
and they were calling him Col Elmore then When I got home I tried to
do like him and everybody laughed at me That is about all that I
remember about the war In those days children did not know things like
thay do now and grown folks did not know as much either
I used to go and watch my father work He was a moulder in the Cherokee
Iron Works way back there when everything was done by hand He moulded
everything from knives and forks to skillets and wash pots If you could
have seen pas hammer you would have seen something worth looking at
It was so big that it jarred the whole earth when it struck a lick Of
course it was a forge hammer driven by water power They called the
hammer Big Henry The butt end was as big as an ordinary telephone
pole
The water wheel had fifteen or twenty spokes in it but when it was
running it looked like it was solid I used to like to sit and watch
that old wheel The water ran over it and the more water came over the
more power the wheel gave out
At the Iron Works they made everything by hand that was used in a
hardware store like nails horse shoes and rims for all kinds of
wheels like wagon and buggy wheels There were moulds for everything no
matter how large or small the thing to be made was Pa could almost pick
up the right mould in the dark he was so used to doing it The patterns
for the pots and kettles of different sizes were all in rows each row
being a different size In my mind I can still see them
Hot molten iron from the vats was dipped with spoons which were handled
by two men Both spoons had long handles with a man at each handle The
spoons would hold from four to five gallons of hot iron that poured just
like water does As quick as the men poured the hot iron in the mould
another man came along behind them and closed the mould The large
moulds had doors and the small moulds had lids They had small pans and
small spoons for little things like nails knives and forks When the
mould had set until cold the piece was prized out
Pa had a turn for making covered skillets and fire dogs He made them
so pretty that white ladies would come and give an order for a pair of
dogs and tell him how they wanted them to look He would take his
hammer and beat them to look just that way
Rollers pressed out the hot iron for machines and for special lengths
and things that had to be flat Railroad ties were pressed out in these
rollers Once the man that handled the hot iron to be pressed through
these rollers got fastened in them himself He was a big man The blood
flew out of him as his bones were crushed and he was rolled into a mass
about the thickness and width of my hand Each roller weighed about
2000 pounds
The man who got killed was named Alex Golightly He taught the boys my
age how to swim fish and hunt His death was the worst thing that had
happened in the community The man who worked at the foundry made Alex
a coffin It had to be made long and thin because he was mashed up so
bad In those days coffins were nothing but boxes anyway but Alexs
coffin was the most terrible thing that I have ever seen I reckon if
they had had pretty coffins then like they do now folks would have
bought them to sleep in
Hundreds went to Alexs funeral white and black to see that long
narrow coffin and the grave which was dug to fit it On the way to the
graveyard negroes sang songs for Alex was a good man They carried him
to the Cherokee graveyard on the old Smith Ford Road and there they
buried him My father helped to build the coffin and he helped haul him
to the graveyard Pa worked at the Iron Foundry until he was very old
He worked there before I was ever born
My father was sold four times during slavery When he was brought to
Virginia he was put on the block and auctioned off for 4000 He said
that the last time he was sold he only brought 1500 He was born in
Alabama When he was bought he was carried from Alabama to Virginia It
was Col Elmore who took him He wanted to go to Alabama again so Col
Elmore let a speculator take him back and sell him He stayed there for
several years and got homesick for South Carolina He couldnt get his
marster to sell him back here so he just refugeed back to Col Elmores
plantation Col Elmore took him back and wouldnt let anybody have him
Pa married twice about the same time He married Dorcas Cooper who
belonged to the Coopers at Staunton Military Academy I was the first
child born in Camden She had sixteen children I was brought to
Spartanburg County when I was little Both ma and pa were sold together
in Alabama The first time pa came to South Carolina he married a girl
called Jenny She never had any children When he went to Alabama
Dorcas went with him but Jenny stayed with Col Elmore Of course pa
just jumped the broom for both of them
When pa left Alabama to refugee back he had to leave Dorcas They did
not love their marster anyway He put Dorcas up on the block with a red
handkerchief around her head and gave her a red apple to eat She was
sold to a man whose name I have forgotten When they herded them she got
away and was months making her way back to South Carolina Those
Africans sure were strong She said that she stayed in the woods at
night Negroes along the way would give her bread and she would kill
rabbits and squirrels and cook and eat in the woods She would get drunk
and beat any one that tried to stop her from coming back When she did
get back to Col Elmores place she was lanky ragged and poor but
Col Elmore was glad to see her and told her he was not going to let
anybody take her off Jenny had cared so well for her children while she
was off that she liked her They lived in the same house with pa till
my mother died
Col Elmore said that negroes who were from Virginia and had African
blood could stand anything He was kind to ma He fed her extra and she
soon got fat again She worked hard for Col Elmore and she and pa sure
did love him One time a lot of the negroes in the quarter got drunk and
ma got to fighting all of them When she got sobered up she was afraid
that Col Elmore was going to send her back to Alabama so she went and
hid in the woods Pa took food to her In about a month Col Elmore
asked where she was and pa just looked sheepish and grinned Col
Elmore told pa to go and bring her back for he said he was tired of
having his rations carried to the woods so ma came home She had stayed
off three months She never felt well anymore and she died in about
three more months Pa and Jenny kept us till we got big and went off to
ourselves
Jenny was born and raised in South Carolina and she was good to
everybody and never fought and went on like ma did Ma liked her and
would not let anybody say anything against her She was good to pa till
he died a real old man Jenny never had any children She was not old
when she died but just a settled woman We felt worse over her death
than we did over mas because she was so good to us and had cared for
us while ma and pa were in Alabama then she was good to us after Dorcas
died and when she hid in the woods
It seems that folks are too tender now They cant stand much My ma
could stand more than I can My children cant stand what I can right
now
