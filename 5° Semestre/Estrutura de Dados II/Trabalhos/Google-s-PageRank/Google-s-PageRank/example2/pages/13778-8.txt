I lay no claim to having inherited Elbert Hubbards Genius his
Personality his Insight into the Human Heart I am another and totally
different sort of man
I know my limitations
Also I am acquainted with such ability as I possess and I believe that
it can be directed to serve you
I got my schooling in East Aurora
I have never been to College But I have traveled across this Country
several times with my Father
I have traveled abroad with him One time we walked from Edinburgh to
London to prove that we could do it
My Father has been my teacherand I do not at all envy the College Man
For the last twenty years I have been working in the Roycroft Shops
I believe I am well grounded in Businessalso in Work
When I was twelve years old my father transferred Ali Baba to the
gardenand I did the chores around the house and barn for a dollar a
week From that day forward I earned every dollar that ever came to me
I fed the printingpress at four dollars a week Then when we purchased a
gasengine I was promoted to be engineer and given a pair of long
overalls
Two or three years later I was moved into the General Office where I
opened mail and filled in orders
Again I was promoted into the Private Office and permitted to sign my
name under my Fathers on checks
Then the responsibility of purchasing materials was given me
One time or another I have worked in every Department of the Roycroft
Shops
My association with Elbert Hubbard has been friendly brotherly I have
enjoyed his complete confidenceand I have tried to deserve it
He believed in me loved me hoped for me Whether I disappointed him at
times is not important I know my average must have pleased him because
the night he said Farewell to the Roycrofters he spoke well of me very
well of me and he left the Roycroft Institution in my charge
He sailed away on the Lusitania intending to be gone several weeks His
Little Journey has been prolonged into Eternity
But the work of Elbert and Alice Hubbard is not done With them one task
was scarcely under way when another was launched Whether complete or
incomplete there had to be an end to their effort sometime and this is
the end
Often Elbert Hubbard would tell the story of Tolstoy who stopped at the
fence to question the worker in the field My Man if you knew you were
to die tomorrow what would you do today And the worker begrimed with
sweat would answer I would plow
Thats the way Elbert Hubbard lived and died and yet he did morehe
planned for the future He planned the future of the Roycroft Shop Death
did not meet him as a stranger He came as a sometimeexpected friend
Father was not unprepared
The plan that would have sustained us the seven weeks he was in Europe
will sustain us seven yearsand another seven years
Elbert Hubbards work will go on
I know of no Memorial that would please Elbert Hubbard half so well as to
broaden out the Roycroft Idea
So we will continue to make handmade Furniture handhammered Copper
Modeled Leather We shall still triumph in the arts of Printing and
Bookmaking
The Roycroft Inn will continue to swing wide its welcoming door and the
kind greeting is always here for you
The Fra will not miss an issue and you who have enjoyed it in the past
will continue to enjoy it
The Philistine belonged to Elbert Hubbard He wrote it himself for just
twenty years and one month No one else could have done it as he did No
one else can now do it as he did
So for very sentimental reasonswhich overbalance the strong temptation
to continue The PhilistineI consider it a duty to pay him the tribute
of discontinuing the little Magazine of Protest
The Roycrofters Incorporated is a band of skilled men and women For
years they have accomplished the work that has invited your admiration
You may expect much of them now The support they have given me the
confidence they have in me is as a great mass of power and courage
pushing me on to success
This thought I would impress upon you It will not be the policy of The
Roycrofters to imitate or copy This place from now on is what we make it
The past is past the future spreads a golden red against the eastern sky
I have the determination to make a Roycroft Shopthat Elbert Hubbard
leaning out over the balcony will look down and say Good boy
Bertgood boy
I have Youth and Strength
I have Courage
My Head is up

ELIZABETH B BROWNING
I have been in the meadows all the day
And gathered there the nosegay that you see
Singing within myself as bird or bee
When such do fieldwork on a morn of May
Irreparableness
Illustration ELIZABETH B BROWNING
Writers of biography usually begin their preachments with the rather
startling statement The subject of this memoir was bornHere follows
a date the name of the place and a cheerful little Mrs Gamp anecdote
this as preliminary to launching forth
It was the merry Andrew Lang I believe who filed a general protest
against these machinemade biographies pleading that it was perfectly
safe to assume the man was born and as for the time and place it mattered
little But the merry man was wrong for Time and Place are often masters
of Fate
For myself I rather like the good oldfashioned way of beginning at the
beginning But I will not tell where and when Elizabeth was born for I do
not know And I am quite sure that her husband did not know The
encyclopedias waver between London and Herefordshire just according as
the writers felt in their hearts that genius should be produced in town or
country One man with opinions pretty well ossified on this subject
having been challenged for his statement that Mrs Browning was born at
Hope End rushed into print in a letter to the Gazette with the
countercheck quarrelsome to the effect You might as well expect
throstles to build nests on Fleet Street buses as for folks of genius
to be born in a big city As apology for the mans ardor I will explain
that he was a believer in the Religion of the East and held that spirits
choose their own time and place for materialization
Mrs Ritchie authorized by Mr Browning declared Burn Hill Durham the
place and March Sixth Eighteen Hundred Nine the time In reply John H
Ingram brings forth a copy of the Tyne Mercury for March Fourteenth
Eighteen Hundred Nine and points to this
In London the wife of Edward M Barrett of a daughter
Mr Browning then comes forward with a fact that derricks can not budge
that is Newspapers have ever had small regard for truth Then he adds
My wife was born March Sixth Eighteen Hundred Six at Carlton Hall
Durham the residence of her fathers brother One might ha thought that
this would be the end ont but it wasnt for Mr Ingram came out with
this sharp rejoinder Carlton Hall was not in Durham but in Yorkshire
And I am authoritatively informed that it did not become the residence of
S Moulton Barrett until some time after Eighteen Hundred Ten Mr
Brownings latest suggestions in this matter can not be accepted In
Eighteen Hundred Six Edward Barrett not yet twenty years of age is
scarcely likely to have already been the father of the two children
assigned to him And there the matter rests Having told this much I
shall proceed to launch forth
The earlier years of Elizabeth Barretts life were spent at Hope End near
Ledbury Herefordshire I visited the place and thereby added not only one
day but several to my life for Ali counts not the days spent in the
chase There is a description of Hope End written by an eminent clergyman
to whom I was at once attracted by his literary style This gentlemans
diction contains so much clearness force and elegance that I can not
resist quoting him verbatim The residentiary buildings lie on the ascent
of the contiguous eminences whose projecting parts and bending
declivities modeled by Nature display astonishing harmoniousness It
contains an elegant profusion of wood disposed in the most careless yet
pleasing order much of the park and its scenery is in view of the
residence from which vantagepoint it presents a most agreeable
appearance to the enraptured beholder So there you have it
Here Elizabeth Barrett lived until she was twenty She never had a
childhoodt was dropped out of her life in some way and a Greek grammar
inlaid instead Of her mother we know little She is never quoted never
referred to her wishes were so whisperingly expressed that they have not
reached us She glides a pale shadow across the diary pages Her
husbands will was to her supreme his whim her conscience We know that
she was sad often ill that she bore eight children She passed out
seemingly unwept unhonored and unsung after a married existence of
sixteen years
Elizabeth Barrett had the same number of brothers and sisters that
Shakespeare had and we know no more of the seven Barretts who were
swallowed by oblivion than we do of the seven Shakespeares that went not
astray
Edward Moulton Barrett had a sort of fierce passionate jealous affection
for his daughter Elizabeth He set himself the task of educating her from
her very babyhood He was her constant companion her tutor adviser
friend When six years old she studied Greek and when nine made
translations in verse Mr Barrett looked on this sort of thing with much
favor and tightened his discipline reducing the little girls hours for
study to a system as severe as the laws of Draco Of course the childs
health broke From her thirteenth year she appears to us like a beautiful
spirit with an astral form or she would did we not perceive that this
beautiful form is being racked with pain No wonder some one has asked
Where then was the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
But this brave spirit did not much complain She had a will as strong as
her fathers and felt a Spartan pride in doing all that he asked and a
little more She studied wrote translated read and thought
And to spur her on and to stimulate her Mr Barrett published several
volumes of her poems It was immature pedantic work but still it had a
certain glow and gave promise of the things yet to come
One marked event in the life of Elizabeth Barrett occurred when Hugh
Stuart Boyd arrived at Hope End He was a fine sensitive soula poet by
nature and a Greek scholar of repute He came on Mr Barretts invitation
to take Mr Barretts place as tutor The young girl was confined to her
bed through the advice of physicians Boyd was blind
Here at once was a bond of sympathy No doubt this break in the monotony
of her life gave fresh courage to the fair young woman The gentle
sightless poet relaxed the severe hours of study Instead of grim digging
in musty tomes they talked he sat by her bedside holding the thin hands
for the blind see by the sense of touch and they talked for hoursor
were silent which served as well Then she would read to the blind man
and he would recite to her for he had the blind Homers memory She grew
better and the doctors said that if she had taken her medicine regularly
and not insisted on getting up and walking about as guide for the blind
man she might have gotten entirely well
In that fine poem Wine of Cyprus addressed to Boyd we see how she
acknowledges his goodness There is no wine equal to the wine of
friendship and love is only friendshipplus something else There is
nothing so hygienic as friendship
Hell is a separation and Heaven is only a going home to our friends
Mr Barretts fortune was invested in sugarplantations in Jamaica
Through the emancipation of the blacks his fortune took to itself wings
He had to give up his splendid country hometo break the old ties It was
decided that the family should move to London Elizabeth had again taken
to her bed The mattress on which she lay was borne down the steps by four
men one man might have carried her alone for she weighed only
eightyfive pounds so they say
Crabb Robinson who knew everything and everybody being very much such a
man as John Kenyon has left on record the fact that Mr Kenyon had a face
like a Benedictine monk a wit that never lagged a generous heart and a
tongue that ran like an Alpine cascade
A razor with which you can not shave may have better metal in it than one
with a perfect edge One has been sharpened and the other not And I am
very sure that the men who write best do not necessarily know the most
Fate has put an edge on themthats all A good kick may start a stone
rolling when otherwise it rests on the mountainside for a generation
Kenyon was one type of the men who rest on the mountainside He dabbled
in poetry wrote bookreviews collected rare editions attended first
nights spoke mysteriously of stuff he was working on and sometimes
confidentially told his lady friends of his intention to bring it out when
he had gotten it into shape asking their advice as to bindings etc Men
of this type rarely bring out their stuff for the reason that they never
get it into shape When they refer to the novel they have on the stocks
they refer to a novel they intend to write It is yet in the inkbottle
And there it remainsall for the want of one good kickbut perhaps its
just as well
Yet these friendly beings are very useful members of society They are
brighter companions and better talkers than the men who exhaust
themselves in creative work and at odd times favor their friends with
choice samples of literary irritability John Kenyon wrote a few bright
little things but his best work was in the encouragement he gave others
He sought out all literary lions and tamed them with his steady glance
They liked his prattle and goodcheer and he liked them for many
reasonsone of which was because he could go away and tell how he advised
them about this that and the other Then he fed them too
And so unrivaled was Kenyon in this line that he won for himself the title
of The Feeder of Lions Now John Kenyonrich idle bookish and
generoussaw in the magazines certain fine little poems by one Elizabeth
Barrett He also ascertained that she had published several books Mr
Kenyon bought one of these volumes and sent it by a messenger with a
little note to Miss Barrett telling how much he had enjoyed it and craved
that she would inscribe her name and his on the flyleaf and return by
bearer Of course she complied with such a modest request so gracefully
expressed these things are balm to poets souls Next Mr Kenyon called
to thank Miss Barrett for the autograph Soon after he wrote to inform
her of a startling fact that he had just discovered they were kinsmen
cousins or somethinga little removed but cousins still In a few weeks
they wrote letters back and forth beginning thus Dear Cousin
And I am glad of this cousinly arrangement between lonely young people
They grasp at it and it gives an excuse for a bit of closer relationship
than could otherwise exist with propriety Goodness me is he not my
cousin Of course he may call as often as he chooses It is his right
But let me explain here that at this time Mr Kenyon was not so very
youngthat is he was not absurdly young he was fifty But men who
really love books always have young hearts Kenyons father left him a
fortune no troubles had ever come his way and his was not the
temperament that searches them out He dressed young looked young acted
young felt young
No doubt John Kenyon sincerely admired Elizabeth Barrett and prized her
work And while she read his mind a deal more understandingly than he did
her poems she was grateful for his kindly attention and wellmeant
praise He set about to get her poems into better magazines and to find
better publishers for her work He was not a gifted poet himself but to
dance attendance on one afforded a gratification to his artistic impulse
He could not write sublime verse himself but he could tell others how So
Miss Barrett showed her poems to Mr Kenyon and Mr Kenyon advised that
the Ps be made bolder and the tails to the Qs be lengthened He also
bought her a new kind of manuscript paper over which a quill pen would
glide with glee it was the kind Byron used But best of all Mr Kenyon
brought his friends to call on Miss Barrett and many of these friends
were men with good literary instincts The meeting with these strong minds
was no doubt a great help to the little lady shut up in a big house and
living largely in dreams
Mary Russell Mitford was in London about this time on a little visit and
of course was sought out by John Kenyon who took her sightseeing She was
fifty years old too she spoke of herself as an old maid but didnt
allow others to do so Friends always spoke of her as Little Miss
Mitford not because she was little but because she acted so Among
other beautiful sights that Mr Kenyon wished to show gushing little Mary
Mitford was a Miss Barrett who wrote things So together they called on
Miss Barrett
Little Miss Mitford looked at the pale face in its frame of dark curls
lying back among the pillows Little Miss Mitford bowed and said it was a
fine day then she went right over and kissed Miss Barrett and these two
women held each others hands and talked until Mr Kenyon twisted
nervously and hinted that it was time to go
Miss Barrett had not been out for two months but now these two insisted
that she should go with them The carriage was at the door they would
support her very tenderly Mr Kenyon himself would driveso there could
be no accidents and they would bring her back the moment she was tired
So they went did these three and as Mr Kenyon himself drove there were
no accidents
I can imagine that James the coachman gave up the reins that day with only
an inward protest and after looking down and smiling reassurance Mr
Kenyon drove slowly towards the Park little Miss Mitford forgot her
promise not to talk incessantly and the dainty whiteporcelain lady
brushed back the raven curls from time to time and nodded indulgently
Not long ago I called at Number Seventyfour Gloucester Place where the
Barretts lived It is a plain solid brick house built just like the ten
thousand other brick houses in London where welltodo tradesmen live The
people who now occupy the house never heard of the Barretts and surely do
not belong to a Browning Club I was told that if I wanted to know
anything about the place I should apply to the Agent whose name is
Opkins and whose office is in Clifford Court off Fleet Street The house
probably has not changed in any degree in these fifty years since little
Miss Mitford on one side and Mr Kenyon on the other tenderly helped Miss
Barrett down the steps and into the carriage
I lingered about Gloucester Place for an hour but finding that I was
being furtively shadowed by various servants and discovering further that
a policeman had been summoned to look after my case I moved on
That night after the ride Miss Mitford wrote a letter home and among
other things she said I called today at a Mr Barretts The eldest
daughter is about twentyfive She has some spinal affection but she is a
charming sweet young woman who reads Greek as I do French She has
published some translations from schylus and some striking poems She is
a delightful creature shy timid and modest
The next day Mr Kenyon gave a little dinner in honor of Miss Mitford who
was the author of a great book called Our Village That night when Miss
Mitford wrote her usual letter to the folks down in the country telling
how she was getting along she described this dinnerparty She says
Wordsworth was therean adorable old man Then there was Walter Savage
Landor too as splendid a person as Mr Kenyon himself but not so full
of sweetness and sympathy But best of all the charming Miss Barrett who
translated the most difficult of the Greek plays Prometheus Bound She
has written most exquisite poems too in almost every modern style She
is so sweet and gentle and so pretty that one looks at her as if she were
some bright flower Then in another letter Miss Mitford adds She is of
a slight delicate figure with a shower of dark curls falling on either
side of a most expressive face large tender eyes richly fringed by dark
lashes a smile like a sunbeam and such a look of youthfulness that I had
some difficulty in persuading a friend that she was really the translator
of schylus and the author of the Essay on Mind
When Miss Mitford went back home she wrote Miss Barrett a letter most
every day She addresses her as My Sweet Love My Dearest Sweet and
My Sweetest Dear She declares her to be the gentlest strongest
sanest noblest and most spiritual of all living persons And moreover she
wrote these things to others and published them in reviews She gave
Elizabeth Barrett much good advice and some not so good Among other
things she says Your one fault my dear is obscurity You must be
simple and plain Think of the stupidest person of your acquaintance and
when you have made your words so clear that you are sure he will
understand you may venture to hope it will be understood by others
I hardly think that this advice caused Miss Barrett to bring her lines
down to the level of the stupidest person she knew She continued to write
just as she chose Yet she was grateful for Miss Mitfords glowing
friendship and all the pretty gush was accepted although perhaps with
good large pinches of the Syracuse product
Of course there are foolish people who assume that gushing women are
shallow but this is jumping at conclusions A recent novel gives us a
picture of a tall soldier who in camp was very full of brag and
bluster We are quite sure that when the fight comes on this man with the
lubricated tongue will prove an arrant coward we assume that he will run
at the first smell of smoke But we are wronghe stuck and when the flag
was carried down in the rush he rescued it and bore it bravely so far to
the front that when he came back he brought anotherthe tawdry red flag
of the enemy
I slip this in here just to warn hasty folk against the assumption that
talkative people are necessarily vacantminded Man has a manysided
nature and like the moon reveals only certain phases at certain times
And as there is one side of the moon that is never revealed at all to
dwellers on the planet Earth so mortals may unconsciously conceal certain
phases of soulstuff from each other
Miss Barrett seems to have written more letters and longer ones to Miss
Mitford than to any of her other correspondents save one Yet she was
aware of this rather indiscreet womans limitations and wrote down to her
understanding
To Richard H Horne she wrote freely and at her intellectual best With
this allround gifted man she kept up a correspondence for many years
and her letters now published in two stout volumes afford a literary
history of the time At the risk of being accused of lack of taste I wish
to say that these letters of Miss Barretts are a deal more interesting to
me than any of her longer poems They reveal the manysided qualities of
the writer and show the workings of her mind in various moods Poetry is
such an exacting form that it never allows the author to appear in
dressinggown and slippers neither can he call over the back fence to his
neighbor without loss of dignity
Horne was author editor and publisher His middle name was Henry but
following that peculiar penchant of the inkstained fraternity to play
flimflam with their names he changed the Henry to Hengist so we now see
it writ thus R Hengist Horne
He found a market for Miss Barretts wares More properly he insisted
that she should write certain things to fit certain publications in which
he was interested They collaborated in writing several books They met
very seldom and their correspondence has a fine friendly flavor about it
tempered with a disinterestedness that is unique They encourage each
other criticize each other They rail at each other in witty quips and
quirks and at times the air is so full of gibes that it looks as if a
quarrel were appearing on the horizonno bigger than a mans handbut
the storm always passes in a gentle shower of refreshing compliments
Meantime dodging in and out we see the handsome gracious and kindly
John Kenyon
Much of the time Miss Barrett lived in a darkened room seeing no one but
her nurse the physician and her father Fortune had smiled again on
Edward Barretta legacy had come his way and although he no longer owned
the black men in Jamaica yet they were again working for him Sugarcane
mills ground slow but small
The brilliant daughter had blossomed in intellect until she was beyond her
teacher She was so far ahead that he called to her to wait for him He
could read Greek she could compose in it But she preferred her native
tongue as every scholar should Now Mr Barrett was jealous of the fame
of his daughter The passion of father for daughter of mother for
sonthere is often something very loverlike in ita deal of whimsy Miss
Barretts darkened room had been illumined by a light that the gruff and
goodly merchant wist not of Loneliness and solitude and physical pain and
hearthunger had taught her things that no book recorded nor tutor knew
Her father could not follow her her allusions were obscure he said
wilfully obscure she was growing perverse
Love is a pain at times To ease the hurt the lover would hurt the
beloved He badgers her pinches her provokes her One step more and he
may kill her
Edward Barretts daughter she of the raven curls and gentle ways was
reaching a point where her fathers love was not her life A good way to
drive love away is to be jealous He had seen it coming years before he
brooded over it the calamity was upon him Her fame was growing some one
called her the Shakespeare of women First her books had been published
at her fathers expense next editors were willing to run their own
risks and now messengers with banknotes waited at the door and begged to
exchange the banknotes for manuscript John Kenyon said I told you so
but Edward Barrett scowled He accused her foolishly he attempted to
dictate to hershe must use this ink or that Why Because he said so He
quarreled with her to ease the lovehurt that was smarting in his heart
Poor little palefaced poet Earthly success has nothing left for thee
Thy thoughts too great for speech fall on dull ears Even thy father
for whom thou first took up pen doth not understand thee and a mothers
love thou hast never known And fame without lovehow barren Heaven is
thy home Let slip thy thin white hands on the thread of life and glide
gently out at ebb of tideout into the unknown It can not but be better
than thisGod understands Compose thy troubled spirit give up thy vain
hopes See thy youth is past little woman look closely there are gray
hairs in thy locks thy face is marked with lines of care and have I not
seen signs of winter in thy veins Earth holds naught for thee Come take
thy pen and write just a last goodby a tender farewell such as thou
alone canst say Then fold thy thin hands and make peace with all by
passing out and away out and awayGod understands
Elizabeth Barrett was thirtyseven and Miss Mitford up to London from
the country for a couple of days wrote home that she had lost her winsome
beauty
John Kenyon had turned well into sixty but he carried his years in a
jaunty way He wore a mossrose bud in the lapel of his wellfitting coat
His linen was immaculate and the only change people saw in him was that
he wore spectacles in place of a monocle
The physicians allowed Mr Kenyon to visit the darkened room whenever he
chose for he never stayed so very long neither was he ever the bearer of
bad news
Did the greatest poetess of the age temporarily slightly indisposed know
one BrowningRobert Browning a writer of verse Why no she had never
met him but of course she knew of him and had read everything he had
written He had sent her one of his books once He was surely a man of
brilliant partsso strong and farseeing He lives in Italy with the
monks they say What a pity the English people do not better appreciate
him
But he may succeed yet said Mr Kenyon He is not old
Oh of course such genius must some day be recognized But he may be
gone thenhow old did you say he was
Mr Kenyon had not said but he now explained that Mr Browning was
thirtyfour that is to say just the age of himself ahem Furthermore
Mr Browning did not live in Italythat is not now for at that present
moment he was in London In fact Mr Kenyon had lunched with him an hour
before They had talked of Miss Barrett for who else was there among
women worth talking of and Mr Browning had expressed a wish to see her
Mr Kenyon had expressed a wish that Mr Browning should see her and now
if Miss Barrett would express a wish that Mr Browning should call and see
her why Mr Kenyon would fetch himdoctors or no doctors
And he fetched him
And Im glad arent you
Now Robert Browning was not at all of the typical poet type In stature
he was rather short his frame was compact and muscular In his youth he
had been a wrestlercarrying away laurels of a different sort from those
which he was to wear later His features were inclined to be heavy in
repose his face was dull and there was no fire in his glance He wore
loosefitting plain gray clothes a slouchhat and thicksoled shoes At
first look you would have said he was a wellfed welltodo country
squire On closer acquaintance you would have been impressed with his
dignity his perfect poise and his fine reserve And did you come to know
him well enough you would have seen that beneath that seemingly phlegmatic
outside there was a spiritual nature so sensitive and tender that it
responded to all the finer thrills that play across the souls of men Yet
if there ever was a man who did not wear his heart upon his sleeve for
daws to peck at it was Robert Browning He was clean wholesome manly
healthy inside and out He was master of self
Of course the gentle reader is sure that the next act will show a tender
lovescene And were I dealing with the lives of Peter Smith and Martha
the milkmaid the gentle reader might be right
But the love of Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett is an instance of
the Divine Passion Take off thy shoes for the place whereon thou
standest is holy ground This man and woman had gotten well beyond the
first flush of youth there was a joining of intellect and soul which
approaches the ideal I can not imagine anything so preposterous as a
proposal passing between them I can not conceive a condition of
hesitancy and timidity leading up to a dambursting avowal They met
looked into each others eyes and each there read his fate no coyness
no affectation no fencingthey loved Each at once felt a heartrest in
the other Each had at last found the other self
That exquisite series of poems Sonnets From the Portuguese written by
Elizabeth Barrett before her marriage and presented to her husband
afterward was all told to him over and over by the look from her eyes
the pressure of her hands and in gentle words or silence that knew
neither shame nor embarrassment
And now it seems to me that somewhere in these pages I said that
friendship was essentially hygienic I wish to make that remark again and
to put it in italics The Divine Passion implies the most exalted form of
friendship that man can imagine
Elizabeth Barrett ran up the shades and flung open the shutters The
sunlight came dancing through the apartment flooding each dark corner and
driving out all the shadows that lurked therein It was no longer a
darkened room
The doctor was indignant the nurse resigned
Miss Mitford wrote back to the country that Miss Barrett was really
looking better than she had for years
As for poor Edward Moulton Barretthe raved He tried to quarrel with
