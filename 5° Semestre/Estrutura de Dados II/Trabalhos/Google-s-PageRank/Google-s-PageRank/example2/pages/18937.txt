THE LITTLE OLD WOMAN WHO LIVED IN A SHOE
Once on a time there was a Little Old Woman who lived in a Shoe This
shoe stood near a great forest and was so large that it served as a
house for the Old Lady and all her children of which she had so many
that she did not know what to do with them
Illustration Old Woman with children and Shoe
But the Little Old Woman was very fond of her children and they only
thought of the best way to please her Strongarm the eldest cut
down trees for firewood Peter made baskets of wickerwork Mark was
chief gardener Lizzie milked the cow and Jenny taught the younger
children to read
Now this Little Old Woman had not always lived in a Shoe She and
her family had once dwelt in a nice house covered with ivy and her
husband was a woodcutter like Strongarm But there lived in a huge
castle beyond the forest a fierce giant who one day came and laid
their house in ruins with his club after which he carried off the
poor woodcutter to his castle beyond the forest When the Little Old
Woman came home her house was in ruins and her husband was no where
to be seen
Illustration Giant holding Woodcutter
Night came on and as the father did not return the Old Lady and her
family went to search for him When they came to that part of the
wood where the Giant had met their father they saw an immense shoe
They spent a long time weeping and calling out for their father but
met with no reply Then the Old Lady thought that they had better
take shelter in the shoe until they could build a new house So Peter
and Strongarm put a roof to it and cut a door and turned it into a
dwelling Here they all lived happily for many years but the Little
Old Lady never forgot her husband and his sad fate Strongarm who
saw how wretched his mother often was about it proposed to the next
eleven brothers that they should go with him and set their father
free from the Giant Their mother knew the Giants strength and
would not hear of the attempt as she feared they would be killed
But Strongarm was not afraid He bought a dozen sharp swords and
Peter made as many strong shields and helmets as well as crossbows
and ironheaded arrows They were now quite ready Strongarm gave
the order to march and they started for the forest The next day
they came in sight of the Giants Castle Strongarm leaving his
brothers in a wood close by strode boldly up to the entrance and
seized the knocker The door was opened by a funny little boy with a
large head who kept grinning and laughing
Illustration Strongarm and Boy with Large Head
Strongarm then walked boldly across the courtyard and presently
met a page who took off his hat and asked him what he wanted
Strongarm said he had come to liberate his father who was kept a
prisoner by the Giant on this the little man said he was sorry for
him because the part of the castle in which his father was kept was
guarded by a large dragon Strongarm nothing daunted soon found
the monster who was fast asleep so he made short work of him by
sending his sword right through his heart at which he jumped up
uttering a loud scream and made as if he would spring forward and
seize Strongarm but the good sword had done its work and the
monster fell heavily on the ground dead

Now the Giant who had been drinking much wine was fast asleep in a
remote part of the castle Strongarm had no sooner finished the
Dragon than up started the funny little boy who had opened the door
He led Strongarm round to another part of the courtyard where he
saw his poor father who at once sprung to his feet and embraced
him Then Strongarm called up his brothers and when they had
embraced their father they soon broke his chain and set him
free
We must now return to the Little Old Woman After her sons had
started she gave way to the most bitter grief While she was in this
state an old witch came up to her and said she would help her as
she hated the Giant and wished to kill him The Old Witch then took
the little Old Lady on her broom and they sailed off through the
air straight to the Giants castle
Illustration Witch and Lady on broom
Now this old Witch had great power and at once afflicted the Giant
with corns and tender feet When he awoke from his sleep he was in
such pain that he could bear it no longer so he thought he would go
in search of his missing shoe which like the other one he had in
his castle was easy and large for his foot When he came to the
spot where the Old Lady and her children lived he saw his old shoe
and with a laugh that shook the trees he thrust his foot into it
breaking through the roof that Strongarm and Peter had put to it
The children in great alarm rushed about inside the shoe and
frightened and trembling scrambled through the door and the slits
which the Giant had formerly made for his corns By this time the
witch and the Little Old Lady as also Strongarm his eleven
brother and his father were come up to the spot Strongarm and his
brothers shot their arrows at him till at last he fell wounded when
Strongarm went up to him and cut off his head Then the father and
the Little Old Woman and all their children built a new house and
lived happily ever afterwards

THE BABES IN THE WOOD
A gentleman of good account
In Norfolk dwelt of late
Whose wealth and riches did surmount
Most men of his estate
Sore sick he was and like to die
No help his life could save
His wife by him as sick did lie
And both were near the grave
No love between these two was lost
Each to the other kind
In love they lived in love they died
And left two babes behind
Now if the children chanced to die
Ere they to age should come
Their uncle should possess their wealth
For so the will did run
Now brother said the dying man
Look to my children dear
Be good unto my boy and girl
No friend else have they here
Illustration Babes and Uncle at deathbed
Their parents being dead and gone
The children home he takes
And brings them both unto his house
Where much of them he makes
He had not kept these pretty babes
A twelvemonth and a day
When for their wealth he did devise
To make them both away
He bargaind with two ruffians bold
Who were of savage mood
That they should take the children twain
And slay them in a wood
They prate and prattle pleasantly
While riding on the way
To those their wicked uncle hired
These lovely babes to slay
Illustration Babes and Ruffians on horseback
So that the pretty speech they had
Made the ruffians heart relent
And they that took the deed to do
Full sorely did repent
Yet one of them more hard of heart
Did vow to do his charge
Because the wretch that hired him
Had paid him very large
The other would not agree thereto
So here they fell at strife
With one another they did fight
About the childrens life
And he that was of milder mood
Did slay the other there
Within an unfrequented wood
The babes did quake for fear
Illustration Ruffian being killed
He took the children by the hand
While they for bread complain
Stay here said he Ill bring ye bread
When I do come again
These pretty babes with hand in hand
Went wandering up and down
But never more they saw the man
Approaching from the town
Illustration Babes wandering
Thus wanderd these two pretty dears
Till death did end their grief
In one anothers arms they died
Poor babes past all relief
No burial these innocents
Of any man receives
But robin redbreast lovingly
Did cover them with leaves
Illustration Robin covering Babes with leaves
The fellow that did take in hand
These children for to kill
Was for a robbery judged to die
As was Gods blessed will
And did confess the very truth
The which is here expressd
Their uncle died while he for debt
Did long in prison rest
Illustration Uncle in prison
LITTLE BOPEEP
Little BoPeep she lost her sheep
And didnt know where to find them
Let them alone and theyll come home
And bring their tails behind them
Illustration Bopeep searching
So runs the Nursery Rhyme Little BoPeep was a very nice little
girl Her cheeks had a bloom on them like a lovely peach and her
voice sounded like a sweet silver bell
But though Little BoPeep was as good as she was beautiful she
sometimes met with misfortunes that made her very sad Once when she
lost her sheep she was very doleful indeed And this is how it
happened
One summer evening when the sun was setting Little BoPeep who had
to rise very early in the morning felt tired and sat down on a bank
covered with daisies Being very weary she soon fell fast asleep Now
the Bellwether of BoPeeps flock was a most stupid and stubborn
fellow I dare say you know that all the sheep in a flock will follow
the Bellwether and that he always wears a bell round his neck It
was a great pity but the Bellwether of BoPeeps flock was very
wild and was much given to wander far away into the wood where of
course the rest of the sheep would follow him
Finding Little BoPeep asleep the tiresome fellow began by standing
on his hind legs and making a great bow to his shadow before him on
the grass After this he whirled himself round like a top shaking
his head all the time and ringing his bell
Illustration BoPeep asleep Bellwether capering
Very soon the rest of the flock began to dance and caper too And
when they had wheeled round their leader for a time they ran off
after him with a bound into the wood Away they went till they were
quite tired out and then they came to a standstill staring at their
leader with very blank faces But the Bellwether looked foolish
enough now and did nothing but shake his head slowly and ring his
bell which seemed to say quite clearly You are lost you are
lost
When Little BoPeep awoke she found her sheep gone and hardly
knowing what she did she walked on and on far into the wood She
met some people with hoes and rakes in their hands and asked them if
they had seen her sheep But they only laughed at her and said No
One man was very cross and threatened to beat her At last she came
to a stile on which an old Raven was perched He looked so wise that
Little BoPeep asked him whether he had seen a flock of sheep But he
only cried Caw caw caw so BoPeep ran on again across the
fields
Illustration Bopeep and Raven
She wandered on till nightfall and being faint with hunger was
very glad to see a light just before her As she went on she saw
that it shone from a cottage window But when she came to the door
it looked so dark and dismal that she was afraid to go in and was
just going to run away when a crosslooking old woman came out and
dragged her into the cottage She made her sit by the side of her
son who was a very ugly youth with a great red face and red
hair
Illustration Bopeep and ugly Youth
The old woman told him that she had brought BoPeep to be his wife
so BoPeep who did not like him at all ran away while they were
asleep But she did not know where to go and gave herself up for
lost when she heard something cry tuwhittuwhoo in the
tree above her It was a great owl which began flapping its wings
with joy BoPeep was frightened at first but as the owl seemed very
kind she followed it It took her to a cottage were there was plenty
to eat and drink and then to BoPeeps great surprise it began to
speak and told her this story
Know dear Maiden said the owl that I am the daughter of a King
and was a lovely Princess but I was changed into an owl by the old
woman at the cottage because I would not marry her ugly son But I
have heard the fairies say that one day a lovely maiden who would
come into this wood to find her lost sheep should be the means of my
gaining my own form again You are that pretty maid and I will take
you to a spot where you will find your sheep but without their
tails The elves will play with them for this night but in the
morning every sheep will have its tail again except the stupid
Bellwether You must then wave his tail three times over my head
and I shall resume my shape again
The owl flew off and led BoPeep into the wood and said Sleep
maiden I will watch How long she was asleep she could not tell
but the charmed spot was suddenly lighted up and she saw the Queen
of the Fairies seated on a bank The Queen said the sheep should be
punished for running away She then saw all her sheep come trooping
into the place and on every sheep there was an Elf who held in his
hand a sheeps tail
Illustration Sheep and Elves
After riding them about for some time and having great fun with
them the mad sport ceased and each Elf restored the tail to his
sheepall but the Bellwethers which their leader hid in a
tree When BoPeep awoke she saw the owl flapping its wings as if
to remind her of her promise so she fetched the tail and waved it
three times over its head when up started the most charming Princess
that ever was seen The princess gave BoPeep a beautiful cottage
and her sheep never ran away from their kind mistress again

THE HISTORY OF FIVE LITTLE PIGS
Illustration Little Pig going to market
The Little Pig who Went to Market
There was once a family of Five Little Pigs and Mrs Pig their
mother loved them all very dearly Some of these little pigs were
very good and took a great deal of trouble to please her The eldest
pig was so active and useful that he was called Mr Pig One day he
went to market with his cart full of vegetables but Rusty the
donkey began to show his bad temper before he had gone very far on
the road All the coaxing and whipping would not make him move So
Mr Pig took him out of the shafts and being very strong drew the
cart to market himself When he got there all the other pigs began
to laugh But they did not laugh so loudly when Mr Pig told them
all his struggles on the road Mr Pig lost no time in selling
his vegetables and very soon after Rusty came trotting into the
marketplace and as he now seemed willing to take his place in the
cart Mr Pig started for home without delay When he got there he
told Mrs Pig his story and she called him her best and most worthy
son
Illustration Little Pig with mother
The Little Pig who Stayed at Home
This little pig very much wanted to go with his brother but as he
was so mischievous that he could not be trusted far away his mother
made him stay at home and told him to keep a good fire while she
went out to the millers to buy some flour But as soon as he was
alone instead of learning his lessons he began to tease the poor
cat Then he got the bellows and cut the leather with a knife so as
to see where the wind came from and when he could not find this out
he began to cry After this he broke all his brothers toys he
forced the drumstick through the drum he tore off the tail from the
kite and then pulled off the horses head And then he went to the
cupboard and ate the jam When Mrs Pig came home she sat down by
the fire and being very tired she soon fell asleep No sooner had
she done so than this bad little pig got a long handkerchief and
tied her in her chair But soon she awoke and found out all the
mischief that he had been doing She saw at once the damage that he
had done to his brothers playthings So she quickly brought out her
thickest and heaviest birch and gave this naughty little pig such a
beating as he did not forget for a long time

The Little Pig who had Roast Beef
This little pig was a very good and careful fellow He gave his
mother scarcely any trouble and always took a pleasure in doing all
she bade him Here you see him sitting down with clean hands and
face to some nice roast beef while his brother the idle pig who
is standing on a stool in the corner with the dunces cap on has
none He sat down and quietly learned his lesson and asked his
mother to hear him repeat it And this he did so well that Mrs Pig
stroked him on the ears and forehead and called him a good little
pig After this he asked her to allow him to help her make tea
He brought everything she wanted and lifted off the kettle from
the fire without spilling a drop either on his toes or the carpet
Byandbye he went out after asking his mothers leave to play with
his hoop He had not gone far when he saw an old blind pig who with
his hat in his hand was crying at the loss of his dog so he put his
hand in his pocket and found a halfpenny which he gave to the poor
old pig It was for such thoughtful conduct as this that his mother
often gave this little pig roast beef We now come to the little pig
who had none
Illustration Little Pig eating roast beef
The Little Pig who had None
This was a most obstinate and wilful little pig His mother had set
him to learn his lesson but no sooner had she gone out into the
garden than he tore his book into pieces When his mother came back
he ran off into the streets to play with other idle little pigs like
himself After this he quarrelled with one of the pigs and got a
sound thrashing Being afraid to go home he stayed out till it was
quite dark and caught a severe cold So he was taken home and put to
bed and had to take a lot of nasty physic
Illustration Little Pig running home
The Little Pig who Cried Wee wee all the Way Home
This little pig went fishing Now he had been told not to go into
Farmer Grumpeys grounds who did not allow any one to fish in his
part of the river But in spite of what he had been told this
foolish little pig went there He soon caught a very large fish and
while he was trying to carry it home Farmer Grumpey came running
along with his great whip He quickly dropped the fish but the
farmer caught him and as he laid his whip over his back for some
time the little pig ran off crying Wee wee wee all the way
home
THE HISTORY OF OLD MOTHER GOOSE AND HER SON JACK
Illustration Mother Goose and family
Old Mother Goose lived in a cottage with her son Jack Jack was a
very good lad and although he was not handsome he was goodtempered
and industrious and this made him betterlooking than half the other
boys Old Mother Goose carried a long stick she wore a highcrowned
hat and highheeled shoes and her kerchief was as white as snow
Then there was the Gander that swam in the pond and the Owl that sat
on the wall So you see they formed a very happy family But what a
fine strong fellow the Gander was Whenever Old Mother Goose wanted
to take a journey she would mount upon his broad strong back and
away he would fly and carry her swiftly to any distance
Illustration Mother Goose and Gander flying
Now Old Mother Goose thought her Gander often looked sad and lonely
so one day she sent Jack to market to buy the finest Goose he could
find It was early in the morning when he started and his way lay
through a wood He was not afraid of robbers so on he went with his
Mothers great clothesprop over his shoulder The fresh morning air
caused Jacks spirits to rise He left the road and plunged into the
thick of the wood where he amused himself by leaping with his
clothesprop till he found he had lost himself After he had made
many attempts to find the path again he heard a scream He jumped up
and ran boldly towards the spot from which the sound came Through an
opening in the trees he saw a young lady trying to get away from a
ruffian who wanted to steal her mantle With one heavy blow of his
staff Jack sent the thief howling away and then went back to the
young lady who was lying on the ground crying
Illustration Jack and young lady
She soon dried her tears when she found that the robber had made off
and thanked Jack for his help The young lady told Jack that she was
the daughter of the Squire who lived in the great white house on the
hilltop She knew the path out of the wood quite well and when they
reached the border she said that Jack must come soon to her fathers
house so that he might thank him for his noble conduct
When Jack was left alone he made the best of his way to the
marketplace He found little trouble in picking out the best Goose
for when he got there he was very late and there was but one left
But as it was a prime one Jack bought it at once and keeping to the
road made straight for home At first the Goose objected to be
carried and then when she had walked along slowly and gravely for a
short time she tried to fly away so Jack seized her in his arms and
kept her there till he reached home
Illustration Jack carrying Goose
Old Mother Goose was greatly pleased when she saw what a fine bird
Jack had bought and the Gander showed more joy than I can describe
And then they all lived very happily for a long time But Jack would
often leave off work to dream of the lovely young lady whom he had
rescued in the forest and soon began to sigh all day long He
neglected the garden cared no more for the Gander and scarcely even
noticed the beautiful Goose But one morning as he was walking by
the pond he saw both the Goose and the Gander making a great noise
as though they were in the utmost glee He went up to them and was
surprised to find on the bank a large golden egg He ran with it to
his mother who said Go to market my son sell your egg and you
will soon be rich enough to pay a visit to the Squire So to market
Jack went and sold his golden egg but the rogue who bought it of
him cheated him out of half his due Then he dressed himself in his
finest clothes and went up to the Squires house Two footmen stood
at the door one looking very stout and saucy and the other sleepy
and stupid
Illustration Jack and Footmen
When Jack asked to see the Squire they laughed at him and made
sport of his fine clothes but Jack had wit enough to offer them each
a guinea when they at once showed him to the Squires room
Now the Squire who was very rich was also very proud and fat and
scarcely turned his head to notice Jack but when he showed him his
bag of gold and asked for his daughter to be his bride the Squire
flew into a rage and ordered his servants to throw him into the
horsepond But this was not so easy to do for Jack was strong and
active and then the young lady come out and begged her father to
release him This made Jack more deeply in love with her than ever
and he went home determined to win her in spite of all And well did
his wonderful Goose aid him in his design Almost every morning she
would lay him a golden egg and Jack grown wiser would no longer
sell them at half their value to the rogue who had before cheated
him So Jack soon grew to be a richer man than the Squire himself
His wealth became known to all the country round and the Squire at
length consented to accept Jack as his soninlaw Then Old Mother
Goose flew away into the woods on the back of her strong Gander
leaving the cottage and the Goose to Jack and his bride who lived
happily ever afterwards
