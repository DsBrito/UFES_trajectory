The roaring reports of the motor fell into abrupt silence as the
driver brought his car to a halt
You signaled he called across the grind of set brakes
In the blending glare of the searchlights from the two machines the
gray one arriving and the limousine drawn to the roadside the young
girl stood her hand still extended in the gesture which had stopped
the man who now leaned across his wheel
Oh please she appealed again
On either side stretched away the Long Island meadows dark
soundless apparently uninhabited Only this spot of light broke the
monotony of dreariness A keen chill October wind sighed past
stirring the girls delicate gown as its folds lay unheeded in the
dust fluttering her furlined cloak and shaking two or three childish
curls from the bondage of her velvet hood The driver swung himself
down and came toward her with the unhasting swiftness of one trained
to the unexpected
I beg pardoncan I be of some use he asked
We are lost she confessed hurriedly If you could set us right I
should be grateful Iwe must get home soon I have been a guest at a
house somewhere here and started to return to New York this
afternoon The chauffeur does not know Long Island we can not seem
to find any place And now we have lost a tire I was afraid
She broke off abruptly as her companion descended from the limousine
We only want to know the way were all right he explained This
is my cousin I came out after her you see Dont get so worried
Emilywell go straight on as soon as Anderson changes the tire
He huddled his words slightly and spoke too rapidly the round
goodhumored face he turned to the white light was too flushed
otherwise there was nothing unusual in his appearance And his caste
was evident and unquestionable in spite of any circumstance There
was no anger in the girls dark eyes as she gazed straight before her
only pity and helpless distress
I can tell your chauffeur the road the driver of the gray car
quietly said Have you far to go
To the St Royal she answered looking at him My uncle is there
Is that far
No you can reach there by ten oclock I will speak to your
chauffeur
Do like a good fellow the other man interposed Awfully obliged
Youre not angry Emily he added lowering his voice and moving
nearer her Since were engaged why should you get frightened simply
because I proposed we get married tonight instead of waiting for a
big wedding I thought it was a good idea you know It isnt my fault
Anderson got lost instead of getting us home for dinner is it
Hush Dick she rebuked hot color sweeping her face You you are
not well And we are not engaged you forget Just because people want
us to be Too proud to let her steadiness quiver she broke the
sentence
If the driver had heard and it was scarcely possible that he had not
he made no sign By the acetylene light he produced an envelope and
pencil and proceeded to sketch a map showing the route to the
limousines chauffeur
Understand it he queried concluding He had a certain decision of
manner not in the least arrogant but the result of a serene
selfsurety that somehow accorded with his lithe trained grace of
movement A judge of men would have read him an athlete perhaps in an
unusual line
Yes sir the chauffeur replied Ill get Miss Ffrench home in no
time after I get the tire on
The indiscretion of the spoken name was ignored except for a slight
lift of the hearers eyebrows
How long does it take you to change a tire
About half an hour its night of course
An odd choking gurgle sounded from the gray machine where a dark
figure had sat until now in quiescent muteness
Half an hour echoed the gray machines driver and faced toward the
chuckle Rupert it isnt in your contract but do you want to come
over and change this tire
Ill do it for you Darling was the sweet response the small
figure rolled over the edge of the car with a catlike celerity
Where are your tools you chauffeur Quick
The bewildered chauffeur mechanically reached for a box on the
runningboard as the young assistant came up grinning all over his
malign dark face
Oh quicker Whats the matter rheumatism They wouldnt have you in
a training camp for motor trucks on Sunday Hustle please
There never had been anything done to that sedate limousine quite as
this was done Even the preoccupied girl looked on in fascination at a
rapidity of unwasted movement suggesting a conjuring feat
By George exclaimed her escort A splendid man youve got there
Really a splendid chauffeur you know
The driver smiled with a gleam of irony but disregarded the comment
Would you like to get into your car he asked the girl You will be
able to start very soon
I see that she acknowledged gratefully Thank you I would rather
wait here
Is your chauffeur trustworthy
Oh yes he has been in my uncles employ for three years But he was
never before out here in this place
There was a pause filled by the soft monotone of insults drifting
from the side of the limousine for Rupert talked while he worked and
his fellowworker did not please him
Wrench baby hippo Oh look behind you where you put ityou need a
memory course You ought to be passing spools to a lady with a
sewingmachine Did you ever see a motorcar before There pump her
up do He rose drew out his watch and glanced at it Five minutes
Ill have to beat that day after tomorrow
The driver looked over at him and their eyes laughed together Now
for the first time the girl noticed that across the shoulders of both
mens jerseys ran in silver letters the name of a famous foreign
automobile
I am very grateful indeed she said bravely and graciously I wish
I could say more or say it better The journey will be short now
But all her dignity could not check the frightened shrinking of her
glance first toward the interior of the limousine and then toward the
man who was to enter there with her And the driver of the gray
machine saw it
We have done very little he returned May I put you in your car
The chauffeur was gathering his tools speechlessly outraged and
making ready to start Seated among the rugs and cushions under the
light of the luxurious car the girl deliberately drew off her glove
and held out her small uncovered hand to the driver of the gray
machine
Thank you she said again meeting his eyes with her own whose
darkness contrasted oddly with the blonde curls clustered under her
hood
You are not afraid to drive into the city alone he asked
Alone Why my cousin
Your cousin is going to stay with me
She flung back her head amazement question relief struggled over
her sensitive face and finally melted into irrepressible mirth under
the fine amusement of his regard
You are cleverand kind to do that No I am not afraid
He closed the door
Take your mistress home he bade the chauffeur Crank for him
Rupert
Why why stammered the limousines other passenger turning as the
motor started
No one heeded him
Byby dont break any records Rupert called after the chauffeur
Hold yourself in do If you shed any more tires telegraph for me
and if Im within a days run Ill come put them on for you and save
you time
Silence closed in again as the red taillight vanished around a bend
The gray cars driver nodded curtly to the stupefied youth in the
middle of the road
Unless you want to stay here all night youd better get in the
machine he suggested My names LestrangeI suppose yours is
Ffrench
Dick Ffrench But see here you mean well but Im going with my
cousin Id like a drive with you but Im busy
Youre not fit to go with your cousin
Not
Fit completed Lestrange definitely Can you hang on somewhere
Rupert
I can Rupert assured with an inflection of his own Get your
friend aboard
Lestrange was already in his seat waiting
Whats that for asked the dazed guest as on taking his place a
strap was slipped around his waist securing him to the seat
So you wont fall out soothed the grinning Rupert You aint well
you know Not that Id care if you did but somebody might blame
Darling
The car leaped forward gathering speed to an extent that was a
revelation in motoring to Ffrench The keen air the giddy rush
through the dark were a sobering tonic After a while he spoke to the
man beside him nervously embarrassed by a situation he was beginning
to appreciate
This is a racing car
It was
Isnt it now
If I were going to race it day after tomorrow I wouldnt be risking
it over a country road tonight A racing machine is petted like a
racehorse until it is wanted
And then
It takes its chances If you are connected with the Ffrenches who
manufacture the Mercury car you should know something of automobile
racing yourself I noticed your limousine was of that make
Yes that is my uncles company I did see a race once at Coney
Island A car turned over and killed its driver and made a nasty muss
II didnt fancy it
A wheel slipped off a stone giving the car a swerving lurch which was
as instantly correctedwith a second lurchby its pilot The effect
was not tranquilizing the shock swept the last confusion from
Ffrenchs brain
Where are you taking me he presently asked
Where do you want to go I will set you down at the next village we
come to you can stay there tonight or you can get a trolley to the
city
The question remained unanswered Several times Ffrench glanced
rather diffidently at his companions clear firm profile and looked
away again without speaking
I went out to get my cousin today and my host gave me a couple of
highballs he volunteered at last I dont know what you thought
Lestrange twisted his car around a belated farmwagon
How old are you he inquired calmly
Twentythree
Im nearly twentyseven Thats what I thought
The simpler mind considered this for a space
Some men are born awake some awake themselves and some are shaken
into awakening paraphrased Lestrange in addition If I were you
Id wake up it comes easier and its sure to arrive anyhow There is
the village aheadshall I stop
It looks terribly dull was the doleful verdict
Then come with me flashed the other unexpectedly for a fractional
instant his eyes left the road and turned to his companions face
Did you ever see race practice at dawn Come try a night in a
training camp
Youd bother with me
Yes
A head bobbed up by Ffrenchs knee where Rupert was clinging in some
inexplicable fashion
Once I rode eight miles out there by the hood head downward holding
in a pin he imparted by way of entertainment
Ffrench stared at the reeling perch indicated and gasped
What for he asked
So we could keep on to our control instead of being put out of the
running of course Did you guess I was curing a headache
But you might have been killed exclaimed Ffrench
Even by the semilight of the lamps there was visible the
mechanicians droll twist of lip and brow
Id drive to hell with Lestrange he explained sweetly and settled
back in his place
Ffrench drew a long breath After a moment he again looked at the
driver
Ill come he accepted And thank you
It was Lestrange who smiled this time with a sudden and enchanting
warmth of mirth
Well try to amuse you he promised
II
It was a business consultation that was being held in Mr Ffrenchs
firelit library in spite of the presence of a teatable and the young
girl behind it A consultation between the two partners who composed
the Mercury Automobile Company of whom the lesser was speaking with a
certain anecdotal weight
And he said he was losing too much time on the turns so the next
round he took the bend at seventytwo miles an hour He went over of
course The third car weve lost this year Im glad the seasons
closed
Emily Ffrench gave an exclamation her velvet eyes widening behind
their black lashes
But the driver Was the poor driver hurt Mr Bailey
He wasnt killed Miss Emily answered Bailey with a tinge of
pensive regret He was a large ruddy whitehaired man with the slow
and careful habit of speech sometimes found in those who live much
with massive machinery No he wasnt killed hes in the hospital
But he wrecked as good a car as ever was built through sheer
foolishness It costs money
Mr Ffrench responded to the indirect appeal with more than usual
irritation his level gray eyebrows contracting
We ought to have better drivers Why do you not get better men
Bailey You wanted to go into this racing business you said the cars
needed advertising My brother always attended to that side of the
factory affairs while he lived with you as his manager Now it is
altogether in your hands Why do you not find a proper driver
Perhaps my hands are not used to holding so much mused Bailey
unresentfully A man might be a good manager maybe and weak as a
partner It isnt the same job But a firstclass driver isnt easy to
get Mr Ffrench Theres Delmar killed and George tied up with
another company and Dorian retired all this last season and we
dont want a foreigner Theres only one man I like
Well get him Pay him enough
Bailey hunched himself together and crossed his legs
Yes sir Hes beaten our carsand othersevery race lately with
poorer machines just by sheer pretty driving He drives fast yet he
dont knock out his car But theres a lot after himtheres just one
way we could get him and get him for keeps
And that
Hes ambitious he wants to get into something more solid than
racing If we offered to make him manager hed come and put some new
ideas maybe into the factory and race our cars wherever we chose to
enter them I know him pretty well
The proposition was advanced tentatively with the hesitation of one
venturing in unknown places But Ethan Ffrench said nothing his gray
eyes fixed on the hearth
He understands motor construction and designing and hes been with
big foreign firms Bailey resumed after waiting Hed be useful
around I cant be everywhere What hed do for us in racing would
help a whole lot Its very well to make a fine standard car but it
needs advertising to keep people remembering And men like to say my
machine is the same as Lestrange won the Cup race with They like
it
I dont know said Mr Ffrench slowly that it is dignified for the
manager of the Mercury factory to be a racing driver
The Christine cars are driven by the son of the man who makes them
was the response Some drive their own
The son of the man who makes them repeated the other He turned his
face still more to the quivering fire his always severe expression
hardening strangely and bitterly The son
The girl rose to draw the crimson curtains before the windows and to
push an electric switch filling the room with a subdued golden glow
in place of the late afternoon grayness Her delicate face as she
regarded her uncle revealed most strongly its characteristic
overearnestness and a sensitive reflection of the moods of those
around her Emily Ffrenchs childhood had been passed in a Canadian
convent and something of its mysticism clung about her As the
cheerful change she had wrought flashed over the room Mr Ffrench
held out his hand in a gesture of summons so that she came across to
sit on the broad arm of his chair during the rest of the conference
her soft gaze resting on the third member
My adopted son and nephew having no such talents we must do the best
we can Mr Ffrench stated with his most precise coldness Being
wellborn and wellbred he has no taste for a mechanics labor or for
circus performances with automobiles in public Who is your man
Bailey
Lestrange sir You must have heard of him often
I never read racing news
I read ours said Bailey darkly Weve been licked often enough by
him And hes straighthes one of the few men wholl stop at the
grandstand and lose time reporting a smashup and sending help
around Every man on the track likes Darling Lestrange
Likes whom
Bailey flushed brickred
I didnt mean to call him that He signs himself D Lestrange and
some of them started reading it Darling joking because he was such a
favorite and because they liked him anyhow Its just a nickname
Emily laughed out involuntarily surprised
I beg pardon she at once apologized but it sounded so frivolous
If you try this man you had better keep that nickname out of the
factory Mr Ffrench advised stiffly What respect could the workmen
feel for a manager with such a title If possible you would do well
to prevent them from recognizing him as the racing driver
Bailey who had risen at the chime of a clock halted amazed
Illustration
Respect for him he echoed Not recognize him Why there isnt a
man on the place who wouldnt give his ears to be seen on the same
side of the street with Lestrange let alone to work under him They
do read the racing news That part of it will be all right if I can
have him
If it is necessary
I think it is sir
Emily moved slightly pushing back her yellowbrown curls under the
ribbon that banded them On a sudden impulse her uncle looked up at
her
What is your opinion he questioned If Dick had been listening I
should have asked his and I fancy yours is fully as valuable Come
shall we have this racing manager
Astonished she looked from her uncle to the other man And perhaps it
was the real anxiety and suspense of Baileys expression that drew her
quick reply
Let us uncle Since we need him let us have him
Very well said Mr Ffrench You hear Bailey
There was a long silence after the junior partners withdrawal
Come where I can see you Emily her uncle finally demanded I
liked your decided answer a few moments ago you can reason How long
have you been a daughter in my house
Six years she responded obediently moving to a low chair opposite
I was fifteen when you took me from the conventto make me very
very happy dear
I sent for you when I sent for Dick and for the same reason I have
tried three times to rear one of my name to fitness to bear it and
each one has failed except you I wish you were a man Emily there
is work for a Ffrench to do
When you say that I wish I were ButIm not Im not She flung
out her slender round arms in a gesture of helpless resignation Im
not even a strongminded woman who might do instead Uncle Ethan may
I askit was Mr Bailey who made me thinkmy cousin whom I never
saw will he never come home
Her voice faltered on the last words frightened at her own daring
But her uncle answered evenly if coldly
Never
He offended you so
His whole life was an offense School college at home in each he
went wrong At twentyone he left me and married a woman from the
vaudeville stage It is not of him you are to think Emily but of a
substitute for him For that I designed Dick once I hoped you would
marry him and sober his idleness
Please no she refused gently I am fond of Dick butplease
no
I am not asking it of you He is well enough a good boy not
overwise but not what is needed here Failed again I am not
fortunate There is left only you
Me
Her startled dark eyes and his determined gray ones met and so
remained
You and your husband Are you going to marry a man who can take my
place in this business in the factory and the model village my
brother and I built around it a man whose name will be fit to join
with ours and so in a fashion preserve it here Will you wait until
such a one is found and will you aid me to find him Or will you too
follow selfish idle fancies of your own
No she answered quite pale I would not do that I will try to
help
You will take up the work the men of your name refuse you will
provide a substitute for them
Her earnestness sprang to meet his strength of will she leaned nearer
in her enthusiasm of selfabnegation scarcely understood
I will find a substitute or accept yours I indeed I will try not to
fail
It was characteristic that he offered neither praise nor caress
You have relieved my mind said Ethan Ffrench and turned his face
once more to the fire
III
It was October when the consultation was held in the library of the
old Ffrench house on the Hudson December was very near on the sunny
morning that Emily drove out to the factory and sought Bailey in his
office
I wanted to talk with you she explained as that gentleman rose to
receive her We have known each other for a long time Mr Bailey
ever since I came from the Sacred Heart to live with Uncle Ethan That
is a very long time
Its a matter of five or six years agreed the charmed Bailey
contemplating her with affectionate pride in her prettiness and grace
You used to drive out here with your pony and spend many an hour
looking on and asking questions Youll excuse me Miss Emily but
there was many a man passed the whisper that youd have made a fine
master of the works
She shook her head folding her small gloved hands upon the edge of
the desk at the opposite sides of which they were seated
At least I would have tried I am quite sure I would have tried But
I am only a girl I came to ask you something regarding that she
lifted her candid eyes to his her soft color rising Do you
knowhave you ever met any men who cared and understood about such
factories as this Men who could take charge of a business the
manufacturing and racing and selling like my uncles I have a reason
for asking
Sure thing said Bailey unexpectedly prompt Ive met one man who
knows how to handle this factory better than I do and Ive been at it
twelve years And there he is he turned in his revolving chair and
rolled up the shade covering the glassset door into the next room
my manager Lestrange
The scene thus suddenly opened to the startled Emily was sufficiently
matteroffact yet not lacking in a certain sober animation of its
own Around a drafting table central in the bare systematic disorder
of the apartment beyond three or four blueshirted men were grouped
bending over a set of drawings which Lestrange was explaining
Explaining with a vivid interest in his task that sparkled over his
clear face in a changing play of expression almost mesmeric in its
command of attention The men watched and listened intently they
themselves no common laborers but the intelligent workmen who were to
carry out the ideas here set forth Wherever Lestrange had been he
was coatless and the sleeves of his outing shirt were rolled back
leaving bare the arms whose smooth symmetry revealed little of the
racing drivers strength his thick brown hair was rumpled into boyish
waves and across his forehead a fine black streak wrote of recent
personal encounter with things practical
Oh exclaimed Emily faintly And after a moment Close the curtain
please
None of the group in the next room had noticed the movement of the
shade absorbed in one another any sound being muffled by the throb
of adjacent machinery Bailey obeyed the request and leaned back in
his chair
Thats Darling Lestrange he stated with satisfaction Thats his
own design for an oiling system hes busy with and its a beauty
Hes entered for every big race coming this season starting next week
in Georgia and meantime he oversees every department in every
building as it never was done before The man for me he is
Emily made an unenthusiastic sign of agreement
I meant very different men from Mr Lestrange she replied her
dignity altogether Ffrench I have no doubt that he is all you say
but I was thinking of another class I meantwell I meant a
gentleman
Oh you meant a gentleman replied Bailey surveying her oddly I
didnt know you see No I dont know any one like that
Thank you Then I will go Iit does not matter
She did not go however but remained leaning on the arm of her chair
in troubled reverie her long lashes lowered Bailey sat as quietly
watching her and waiting
The murmur of voices came dully through the closed door one lighter
and clearer in tone most frequently rising above the roar pervading
the whole building It was not possible that Emilys glimpse of
Lestrange across the glass should identify him absolutely with the man
she had seen once in the flickering lights and shadows on the Long
Island road but he was not of a type easily forgotten and she had
been awakened to a doubting recognition
Now many little circumstances recurred to her a strangeness in
Dicks manner when the new manager was alluded to the fact that her
rescuer on that October night had been driving a racing car and had
worn a racing costume and lastly when Bailey spoke of Darling
Lestrange there had flashed across her mind the mechanicians
ridiculous answer to the request to aid her chauffeur in changing a
tire Ill do it for you Darling And listening to that dominant
voice in the next room she slowly grew crimson before a vision of
herself in the middle of a country road appealing to a stranger for
succor like the heroine of melodramatic fiction Decidedly she
would never see Lestrange never let him discover Miss Ffrench
I will go she reiterated rising impetuously
The glassset door opened with unwarning abruptness
Ill see Mr Bailey declared some one Hell know
Helpless Emily stood still and straightway found herself looking
directly into Lestranges gray eyes as he halted on the threshold
It was Bailey who upheld the moment all unconsciously
Come in he invited heartily Miss Ffrench this is our manager
Mr Lestrange the man whos going to double our sales this year
Emily moved then straightened herself proudly lifting her small
head Lestrange had recognized her she felt the call was to
courage not flight
I think I have already met Mr Lestrange she said composedly I am
pleased to meet him again
Met him cried Bailey Met him Why
Neither heeded him A gleaming surprise and warmth lit Lestranges
always brilliant face
Thank you he answered her You are more than good to recall me
Miss Ffrench I owe an apology for breaking in this way but I fancied
Mr Bailey aloneand he spoils me
It is nothing I was about to go She turned to give Bailey her
hand smiling involuntarily in her relief With a glance an
inflection Lestrange had stripped their former meeting of its
embarrassment and unconventionality how she neither analyzed nor
cared
Good morning said Bailey Shall I take you through or
But Lestrange was already holding open the door with a bright
unconcern as to his workmanlike costume which impressed Emily
pleasantly She wondered if Dick would have borne the situation as
well in the impossible event of his being found at work
The two walked together down an aisle of the huge machinerycrowded
room the grimy men lifting their heads to gaze after Emily as she
passed Once Lestrange paused to speak to a man who sat notebook and
pencil in hand beside another who manipulated under a grinding wheel
a delicate aluminum casting
