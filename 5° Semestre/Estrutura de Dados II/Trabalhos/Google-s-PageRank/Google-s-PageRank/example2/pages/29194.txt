After all Ambrose scarcely a step closer could recall clearly every
word of the bawdy tales
Back to the table again and Brother Ambrose once more noticed how Fray
Lorenzo never let his fork and knife lie crosswise an obvious tribute
he himself always made in Our Senors praise Nor did Lorenzo honor
the Trinity by drinking his orangepulp in three quiet sips rather the
Arian heretic he drained it at a gulp Now he was out trimming his
myrtlebush And touching up his roses
Grrr again Watching his enemy putter away in the deepening twilight
that followed the decline of the Andalusian sun Brother Ambrose
recalled the other traps he had lain to trip the hypocrite Traps set
and failed but oh so delicious anyhow these attempts to send him
flying off to Hell where he belonged a Cathar or a Manichee That last
one involving the pornographic French novel so scrofulous and wicked
How could it failed to have snared its prey Especially when Fray
Ambrose had spent such sleepless nights working out his plot in great
detail
Brother Ambrose allowed himself an inward chortle as he paced along the
portico recollecting how close to success the scheme had come The book
had had to be read first or reread rather by Ambrose to determine
just which chapter would be most apt to damn a soul with concupiscent
suggestion Gray paper with blunt type the whole book had been easy
enough to grasp for that matterwhat with the words so badly spelled
out The cuckoldry tales of Boccaccio and that gay old archpriest Juan
Ruiz de Hita what dry reading they seemed by comparisonalmost like
decretals
As if by misadventure Brother Ambrose had left the book in Lorenzos
cell the pages doubled down at the woeful sixteenth print Ah there
had been a passage Simply glancing at it you groveled hand and foot in
Belials grip
But that twicecursed Lorenzo must have had the devils luck that day
A breeze sprang up to flip the volume closed and the monk not knowing
the books owner and espying only its name had handed it over to the
Prior who had promptly turned the monastery upside down in search of
further such adulterous contraband
Worse fortune followed The next day Brother Lorenzo had come down with
a temporary stroke of blindnessit lasted only a week but even so for
seven days Ambrose had been forced to labor in his stead in the drafty
library copying boresome scrolls in a light scarcely less dim than
moonlight Worse still the Prior had found mistakes letters dropped
transposed Latin was so bothersomely regular compared to the vulgar
tongue For what he called such inexcusable slovenliness the Prior
had imposed a penance of bread and water and extra toil
Slovenliness Why didnt the Priorwas he blind toonotice the
deadly sins that were each day so neatly practised by Brother Lorenzo
They went unpunished Probably Gods Angel would even be found to have
been asleep when Judgment Day came around and Lorenzo would slip into
Heaven by a wink as one might say
Obviously there was no justice except such as man would make himself
Brother Ambrose had at last decided
Ave Maria plena gratia
Now at last he was alone in his cell free finally from the unendurable
sometimes it seemed everlasting torment of Brother Lorenzos presence
Twentynine distinct damnations listed in Galatians if you cared to
look up the text and not one of them could the enemy be made to trip
on adying
In fact of late so bad had the situation grown that Brother Ambrose
had even once considered pledging his soul to Satan Oh not for keeps
No enmity was worth that dread sacrifice But as a trick sort ofwith
a flaw in the indenture that proud Lucifer would miss until it was too
late to wriggle out of the bargain
But that had been two days ago
Now a better scheme presented itself to Brother Ambrose engendered by
that forced labor within the dreary precincts of the convent library
For that was where and when he had made his delightful discovery the
one that would now redeem him from all his irritations and travail The
discovery that would rid him of Brother Lorenzo for always
It had happened like this
Inasmuch as the monastery was over eight hundred years old many ancient
books and moldy scrolls lay forgotten in the cobwebby corners of the
great library especially where the light was gloomy One afternoon
during his week of enforced toil Brother Ambrose had sought the shelter
of one of these illlighted and seldomvisited nooks of the building to
recover certain lost hours of sleep hours that had gone astray the
night before as he sat up in his lonely cell and brooded over his
wrongs But before his drowsy head could nod off into dreams completely
his eye had chanced to notice a faded scroll that jutted forth from its
fellows on the shelves Starting to push the offender back in place
Ambroses fingers had hesitated when he noticed the title De
Necromantiae
Surely thought the monk such a book belonged on the Index Then it
occurred to him that possibly the copy in front of him was the only one
of its kind in the world in which case not even the Holy Father could
be expected to know it existed Then how could it be on the Index or be
forbidden
Taking advantage of this personal achievement in casuistry Brother
Ambrose promptly untied the scroll and began reading
What he discovered there interested him very much We do not intend to
describe all of the marvels unfolded for him in that venerable mildewed
manuscript for some of the more gruesome mysteries of the supernatural
world are better left unrevealed but let it be said at least that one
chapter intrigued Brother Ambrose immensely So much so that he
shamelessly whipped out his scissors and nipping that section stuck it
inside his rough wool robes so he might peruse it at greater leisure
within the privacy of his cell
The chapter that evoked such delight and interest within Brother
Ambroses complicated brain was one that had been penned in the early
ages of the Church by a laybrother who had concerned himself with pagan
magic In it he had described the fiendish habits and activities of
werewolves and had actually even presented a formula Ut Fiat Homo
Lupinus it was entitled which purported to give the secret words and
ritual necessary to achieve the transformation from man to beast
At last the opportunity had arrived Ambroses way to achieve his
longdesired revenge on Brother Lorenzo
Twentyfour hours had passed since the momentous discovery The moment
was at hand Night again had settled upon the Spanish cloisters the
last bell had tolled and all the good and hardy men were supposed to be
at sound sleep on their rough iron cots But in Brother Ambroses chilly
cell a small candle burnedcasting sickly light that produced huge
flickering shadows against the whitewashed walls
Brother Ambrose held the treasured piece of manuscript between his
hands It was difficult to make out the faded Latin the writing was
cramped and crude and Ambrose was no scholar to boot But like all
persons of his times he was quite wellaware of the existence of
werewolves werefoxes and other such monsters and he held no doubt but
what the spell would work
It was the scheming brothers plan to creep in the stealth of night down
the corridor to the barred oak door of Lorenzos own simple cell There
he would knock lightly enough to disturb no other sleepers yet loud
enough that the rapping would summon Brother Lorenzo from whatever
wicked dreams might be festering in his own sleeping mind
As Fray Lorenzos naked footsteps were heard pattering across the bare
floor Ambrose would drink the bats blood he had collected sniff the
wolfbane he had ground to ash and pronounce the obscure Celtic words
that would alter the very atoms of his flesh transforming them into an
obscene travesty of life Brother Lorenzo when he opened the door
would be met not by a fellow human being but by a snarling fanged wolf
that would hurl its hairy bulk at the drowsy monks own throat
The next day the entire monastery would be awakened of course by
shouts of the news that foul murder had been discovered But no amount
of detection would ever manifest the bestial murderer Brother Ambrose
would hug to his soul the secret of his crime until the day of his
shriving
At length the hour had grown so late that it was certain even the Prior
himself must have long since retired
Brother Ambrose made ready to carry out his deed He rose from his cot
removed the coarse brown robe that normally he wore to bed as well as in
his daily rounds so that his longunwashed body stood naked There must
be no chance for telltale blood to stain his clothes when his fierce
talons and wolfish teeth tore and rended at human flesh
Carrying his precious piece of scroll he departed from his cell and
groped his way down the stone corridor until the light improved enough
for him to see his way Luckily a patch of moonlight illuminated the
very space in front of the accursed Brother Lorenzos door What
fortune
Brother Ambrose halted and stared at the door as though his eyes could
see through it at the sleeping form within He sucked in a deep breath
His palms were sweaty his heartbeat rapid For a moment he was almost
ready to back out
Then suddenly the memory of all the hundreds of grudges he bore against
Lorenzo surged through him Hatred built up a massive reservoir that
broke out over his crumbling conscience and flooded his body with anger
and wild resentment His teeth gritted What had he been thinking ofto
retreat now with revenge so nearly at hand
He rapped A moment later he heard a creaking sound like Brother
Lorenzo slipping out of bed
Trembling he lifted the phial of bats blood drank it down It tasted
salty He chewed on the wolfbane powder until it mixed with the saliva
of his mouth then he swallowed Holding the ancient scrollsegment
before him he began to repeat the badlywritten incantation Ut fiat
homo lupinus pulvis arnicae facenda est et dum
A thousand jolts assailed his body as if he had been struck by all the
lightnings in heaven Then came a rushing paralysis a distortion of
time and space a dread feeling of disintegration and death
The door to Brother Lorenzos cell began to recede swelling in volume
as it did The ceiling of the corridor likewise retreated at
everincreasing pace Staring down at his own dwindling frame Ambrose
saw that the slugwhite flesh was now covered with thick fur even as
the limbs were gnarling
Then suddenly the door opened Brother Lorenzo stepped out his kindly
pious face wrinkled with sleep but otherwise showing no irritation or
displeasure at being summoned from his rest At first the monk seemed
not to have noticed Ambroses form for he gazed above him and away
Ambrose kept on shrinking
Finally Brother Lorenzos gaze chanced to glance downward But still
his features mirrored no recognition or alarm only puzzlement
Now thought Ambrose now is the time for me to snarl
But no snarl nor semblance of a snarl emerged from his lips Rather
his lips had elongated into long sucking proboscises while already a
third pair of limbs had commenced growing from his furredover abdomen
This was not a wolflike form he was assuming Ambrose suddenly
realized in terror But if it was not lupine what was it Had he
misread the incantation Had he mispronounced a simple word
The weird crawling form into which he had metamorphosed was now hardly
an inch higher than the surface of the floor But Ambroses eyes had
bulged into great manyfaceted orbs capable of seeing objects with
greater clarity than ever Inches away from him he made out the segment
of scroll he had discarded after reading aloud from it Crawling over to
it he perused the beginning words of the spell
And it suddenly dawned on him while what passed for a heart and
ventricles within his pulpy form began simulating horror that the
ancient monk of centuries ago who had first copied the incantation must
have been as careless of spelling as he For the charm obviously did not
convert its user into a werewolf but rather some other animal
Dredging up all the miserable Latin he knew Ambrose fished for some
word similar to lupinus
And suddenly he had it
Pulicus That was the word the sloppy copyist of yesteryear had
wrongly transcribed
From the word pulex meaning flea
Not how to become a wolflike man but a flealike manthat was what
the formula had described
Ambrose the flea braced himself Gathering his powerful legs under
him he leaped in soaring flight to land upon the object of hatredthe
giant Brother Lorenzo who towered so high above him
But the gentle and considerate Brother Lorenzo who probably would not
have hurt hair nor hide of any other creature on Eartheven he knew
full well that there is only one thing you can do to discourage a flea
