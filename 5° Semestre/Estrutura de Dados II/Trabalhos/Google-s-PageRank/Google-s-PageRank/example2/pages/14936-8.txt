SONGS FOR CATARRHS
The variable climate of our native land as Rowland the Minstrel of
Macassar has elegantly expressed it like a Roman epicure deprives our
nightingales of their tongues and the melodious denizens of our
drawingrooms of their sweet voices
Vainly has Crevelli raised a bulwark of lozenges against the Demon of
Catarrh Soreness will invade the throat and noses run in every family
seeming to be infected with a sentimental furor for bloomingwe presume
from being so newly blown We have seen noses chiseled as it were from
an alabaster block grow in one short day scarlet as our own as though
they blushed for the continual trouble they were giving their proprietors
whilst the peculiar intonation produced by the conversion of the nasals
into liquids and then of the liquids ultimately into mutes leads to the
inference that there must be a stoppage about the bridge and should be
placarded like that of Westminster No thoroughfare
It has been generally supposed that St Cecilia with a cold in her head
would be incompetent to Nix my Dolly and this erroneous and popular
prejudice is continually made the excuse for vocal inability during the
winter months Now the effect which we have before described upon the
articulation of the catarrhed would be in our opinion so far from
displeasing that we feel it would amply compensate for any imperfections
of tune For instance what can be finer than the alteration it would
produce in the wellknown ballad of Oh no we never mention hera
ballad which has almost become wearisome from its sweetness and
repetition With a catarrh the words would run thus
O lo we lever beltiol her
Her labe is lever heard
Struck with this modification of sound PUNCH anxious to cater even for
the catarrhs of his subscribers begs to furnish them with a calzolet
which he trusts will be of more service to harmonic meetings than pectoral
lozenges and paregoric as we have anticipated the cold by converting
every m into b and every n into l

POSSUM UP A GUM TREE
A grand gladiatorial tonguethreshing took place lately in a field near
Paisley between the two great Chartist championsFeargus OConnor and
the Rev Mr Brewster The subject debated was Whether is moral or
physical force the fitter instrument for obtaining the Charter The Doctor
espoused the moral hocussing system and Feargus took up the bludgeon for
physical force After a pretty considerable deal of fireworks had been let
off on both sides it was agreed to divide the field when Feargus waving
his hat ascended into a tree and called upon his friends to follow
him But alas few answered to the summonshe was left in a miserable
minority and the Doctor as the Yankees say decidedly put the critter
up a tree Feargus being a Radical should have kept to the root
instead of venturing into the higher branches of political economy At
all events the Doctor as the Yankees say put the critter up a tree
where we calculate he must have looked tarnation ugly The position was
peculiarly illchosenfor when a fireandfaggot orator begins to speak

leaves

THE HEIR OF APPLEBITE
CHAPTER IX
SHOWS THAT DOCTORS DIFFER
Illustration HHaving christened his child Agamemnon felt it to be his
bounden duty to have him vaccinated but his wifes mother with a
perversity strongly characteristic of the genus strenuously opposed Dr
Jenners plan of repealing the small pox1 and insisted upon having him
inoculated Poor Mrs Applebite was sorely perplexed between her habitual
reverence for the opinions of her mama and the dread which she naturally
felt of converting the face of the infant heir into a plumpudding
Agamemnon had evidently determined to be positive upon this point and all
that could be extracted from him was the one wordvaccination
1 Baylis
To which Mrs Waddledot replied
Vaccination indeedas though the child were a calf Im sure and
certain that the extreme dulness of young people of the present day is
entirely owing to vaccinationit imbues them with a very stupid portion
of the animal economy
As Agamemnon could not understand her he again ejaculatedVaccination
But my dear rejoined Mrs Applebite Mama has had so much experience
that her opinion is worth listening to I know that you give the
preference to
Vaccination interrupted Collumpsion
And so do I but we have heard of grownup peoplewho had always
considered themselves securetaking the small pox dear
To be sure we have chimed in Mrs Waddledot and its a very dreadful
thing after indulgent and tender parents have been at the expense of
nursing clothing physicking teaching music dancing Italian French
geography drawing and the use of the globes to a child to have it
carried off because a misguided fondness has insisted upon
Vaccination shouted pater Collumpsion
Exactly continued the wifes mother Now inoculate at once say I
before the childs shortcoated
Agamemnon rose from his seat and advancing deliberately and solemnly to
the table at which his wife and his wifes mother were seated he slowly
raised his dexter arm above his head and then having converted his hand
into a fist he dashed his contracted digitals upon the rosewood as though
he dared not trust himself with more than one word and that one
wasVaccination
Mrs Waddledots first impulse was to jump out of her turban in which she
would have succeeded had not the mystic rolls of gauze which constituted
that elaborate headdress been securely attached to the chestnut front
with which she had sought for some years to cheat the world into a
forgetfulness of her nativity
I was warned of this I was warned of this exclaimed the disarranged
woman as soon as she obtained breath enough for utterance But I
wouldnt believe it I was told that the member for Puddingbury had driven
one wife to her grave and the other to drinkingI was told that it would
run in the family and that Mr AC Applebite would be no better than
Mr I Applebite
Oh Mamayou really wrong Aggy exclaimed Theresa
Its lucky for you that you think so my dear If ever there was an
illused woman you are that unhappy individual Oh that everIshould
liveto see a child of minehave a child of hers vaccinated against her
wish and here Mrs Waddledot as it is emphatically styled burst into
tears not that we mean to imply that she was converted into an explosive
jet deau but we mean that sheshewhat shall we sayshe blubbered
It is really surprising how very sympathetic women are on all occasions of
weeping scolding and scandalising and accordingly Mrs Applebite
opened the fountains of her eyes and roared in concert with her mama
Agamemnon felt that he was an injured maninjured in the tenderest
pointhis character for connubial kindness and he secretly did what many
husbands have done openlyhe consigned Mrs Waddledot to the gentleman
who is always represented as very black because where he resides there is
no water to wash with
At this agonising moment Uncle Peter made his appearance and as actors
always play best to a good audience the weeping ladies continued their
lachrymose performance with renewed vigour Uncle Peter was a plain
manplain in every meaning of the word that is to say he was very ugly
and very simple and when we tell you that his face resembled nothing but
a halftoasted muffin you can picture to yourself what it must have
looked like under the influence of surprise but nevertheless both
Agamemnon and the ladies simultaneously determined to make him the
arbitrator in this very important matter
Uncle Peter said Agamemnon
Brother Peter sobbed Mrs Waddledot
Which are you an advocate for hystericised Mrs Applebite
Vaccination or inoculation exclaimed everybody ensemble
Now whether Uncle John did clearly understand the drift of the question
put to him or whether he conceived that he was solicited to be the
subject of some benevolent experiments for the advantage of future
generations it is certain that no man ever looked more positively
Illustration ON THE HORN OF A DILEMMA
than Uncle Peter At length the true state of the case was made apparent
to him and the conclusion that he arrived at reflects the greatest
possible credit upon his judgment He decided that as the child was a
divided property for the sake of peace and quietness the heir of
Applebite should be vaccinated in one arm and inoculated in the other
FALSE ALARM
We were paralysed the other day at seeing a paragraph headed Sibthorpes

agitation We thought there existed a greater genius than ourselves and
that some one had discovered that Sibthorp could be converted into
anything but a Member for Lincoln and buffooninwaiting to the House of
Commons We found however that it alluded to a Reverend and not to OUR
Colonel Really the newspaper people should be more careful Such

During the conflagration of the Tower it was apprehended at one time that

and Lord Castlereagh kindly offered their personal services and were
found admirably adapted for the purpose
THE GENTLEMANS OWN BOOK
We will now proceed to the consideration of that indispensable adjunct to
a real gentlemanhis purse This little talisman though of so much real
importance is very limited in the materials of its formation being
confined exclusively to silk It should generally be of net work very
sparingly powdered with small beads and of the most delicate colours
such conveying the idea that the fairy fingers of some beauteous friend
had wove the tiny treasury We have seen some of party colours intended
thereby to distinguish the separate depository of the gold and silver coin
with which it is presumed to be stored This arrangement we repudiate
for a true gentleman should always appear indifferent to the value of
money and affect at least an equal contempt for a sovereign as a
shilling We prefer having the meshes of the purse rather large than
otherwise as whenever it is necessarymind we say necessaryto exhibit
it the glittering contents shining through the interstices are never an
unpleasing object of contemplation
The purse should be used at the cardtable but never produced unless you
are called upon as a loser to pay It may then be resorted to with an
air of nonchalance and when the demand upon it has been honoured it
should be thrown carelessly upon the table as though to indicate your
almost anxiety to make a further sacrifice of its contents Should you
however be a winner any exhibition of the purse might be construed into
an unseemly desire of welling or securing your gains which of course
must always be a matter of perfect indifference to you and whatever
advantages you obtain from chance or skill should be made obvious to every
one are only destined to enrich your valet or be beneficially expended in
the refreshment of cabmen and ladies of faded virtue In order to convey
these intentions more conspicuously should the result of an evening be in
your favour your winnings should be consigned to your waistcoat pocket
and if you have any particular desire to heighten the effect a piece of
moderate value may be left on the table
Illustration A GENTLEMAN TAKING A FIRST FLOOR
cannot do better than find an excuse for a recurrence to his purse and
then the partial exhibition of the coin alluded to above will be found to
be productive of a feeling most decidedly confirmatory in the mind of the
landlady that you are a true gentleman
The same cause will produce the same effect with a tradesman whose
albumwe beg pardon whose ledgeryou intend honouring with your name
You should never display your purse to a poor friend or dependant or the
sight of it might not only stimulate their cupidity or raise their
expectations to an inordinate height but prevent you from escaping with a
moderate douceur by the kind manner in which you slipped a sovereign
into their hand at parting
A servant should never be rewarded from a purse it makes the fellows
discontented for if they see gold they are never satisfied with a
shilling and I must see what can be done for you James
Should you be fortunate enough to break a policemans head or drive over
an old woman you will find that your purse will not only add to the
eclat of the transaction but most materially assist the magistrate
before whom you may be taken in determining that the case is very
trifling and that a fine of 5s will amply excuse you from the effects of
that polite epidemic known vulgo as drunkenness There cannot be a
greater proof of the advantages of a purse than the preceding instance
for we have known numerous cases in which the symptoms have been precisely
the same but the treatment diametrically opposite owing to the absence
of that incontrovertible evidence to characterthe purse
None but a parvenu would carry his money loose and we know of nothing
more certain to ensure an early delivery of your small account than being
detected by a creditor in the act of hunting a sovereign into the corner
of your pocket
We have known tailors bootmakers hatters hosiers
liverystablekeepers c grow remarkably noisy when refused assistance
to meet heavy payments which are continually coming due at most
inconvenient seasons and when repeated denials have failed to silence
them the exhibition only of the purse has procured the desired
effectwe presume by inspiring the idea that you have the means to pay
but are eccentric in your views of creditthus producing with the most
importunate dun

negotiate with you for a few nights performance in a local drama which
shall be written for the occasion and in which you are requested to
represent the Civic dignitary in the identical robes which have become
immortalised by your wearing Mr Dibdin Pitt is of opinion that something
might be done with Whittington and his Cat merely transferring the
scene from London to Dublin and as he hears your county is highly
celebrated for the peculiar breed sending to Ireland for one of the
esteemed Kilkenny species which would give a greater reality to the
dramatis person and feline adjunct This is a mere suggestion as any
other subject you may prefersuch as the Rebellion of 98 Donnybrook
Fair the Interior of the Irish Mansion House or the House of Commons
can be rendered equally effective I beg to call your attention to the
fact that you shall have a clear stage and every advantage as Mr NT
Hicks will be left out of the cast altogether or else play a very small
dumb villain so that you need not fear losing your oratorical reputation
by being outshouted Should you feel disposed to accept the terms one

A PAN FOR DAN
BY ONE OF THE FINEST PISANTRY IN THE WORLD
We have received the following genuine Irish version of a scene from and
for the times from our own peculiar and poetic correspondent
DEAR PUNCH
I beg pardon that yoursilf Im now troublin
But I must let you know what I just seen in Dublin
There Daniel OConnellMayor and great agitator
Has been making a Judy of himself the poor unhappy cratur
At his time of life too tare and ounds its mighty shocking
He shoved ach of his big legs into a span bran new silk stocking
How the divil them calves by any manes was thrust in
Is a mistery to evry one without them black silks busting
And instead of a dacent trousers hanging to his suspenders
He has buttondup onehalf of him in a pair of short kneeenders
Now Punch on your oath did you ever hear the likes o that
But oh houly Paul if you only seen his big cockd hat
Stuck up on the top of his jazya mighty illegant thatch
With hair like young Deaf Burkes all rushing up to the scratch
You must have been divarted and Jewil then he wore
A thundring big Taglionicut purple velvet roquelore
And who but Misther Dan cut it fat in all his pride
Coverd over with white favors like a gentle blushing bride
And wasnt he followd by all the blackguards for his tail
Shouting out for their lives Success to Dan OConnell and Rapale
But the Old Corporation has behaved mighty low and mane
As they wouldnt lend him the loan of the ancient raal goold chain
Nor the collar as they said they thought divil burn em
If theyd done so it was probable Dan never would return em
But goodbye I must be offhes gone to take the chair
So my love to Mrs Punch and no more about the Mayor
PUNCHS PAN TO THE PRINCELET

A roaring Royal boy
And all day long the booming bells
Have rung their peals of joy
And the little parkguns have blazed away
And made a tremendous noise
Whilst the air hath been filld since eleven oclock
With the shouts of little boys
And we have taken our little bell
And rattled and laughd and sang as well

Our little Prince will be daintily swathed
And laid on a bed of down
Whilst his cradle will stand neath a canopy
That is deckd with a golden crown
O we trust when his Queenly Mother sees
Her Princely boy at rest
She will think of the helpless pauper babe
That lies at a milkless breast
And then we will rattle our little bell
And shout and laugh and sing as well
Rootootooit Shallabella
Life to the Prince Fallalderalla
Our little Prince we have not a doubt
Has set up a little cry
But a dozen sweet voices were there to soothe
And sing him a lullaby
We wonder much if a voice so small
Could reach our loved Monarchs ear
If so she said God bless the poor
Who cry and have no one near
So then we will rattle our little bell
And shout and laugh and sing as well
Rootootooit Shallabella
Life to the Prince Fallalderalla
Our little Prince though he heard them not
Hath been greeted with honied words
And his cheeks have been fondled to win a smile
By the Privy Council Lords
Will he trust the charmer in after years
And deem he is more than man
Or will he feel that hes but a speck
In creations mighty plan
Let us hope the best and rattle our bell
And shout and laugh and sing as well
Rootootooit Shallabella
Life to the Prince Fallalderalla
Our little Prince when be grows a boy
Will be taught by men of lore
From the dusty tome of the ancient sage
As Kings have been taught before
But will there be one good true man near
To tutor the infant heart
To tell him the world was made for all
And the poor man claims his part
We trust there will so well rattle our bell
And shout and laugh and sing as well
