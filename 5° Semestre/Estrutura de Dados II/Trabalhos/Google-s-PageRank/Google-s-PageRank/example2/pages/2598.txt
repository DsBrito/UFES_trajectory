others and an ingenious disregard for tenses and the governing powers
of the verb The same singular law which impels people in conversation
with foreigners to imitate their broken English governed the family in
their communications with him He received these evidences of his power
with an indifference not wholly free from scorn The expression of his
eye would occasionally denote that his higher nature revolted from them
I have no doubt myself that his wants were frequently misinterpreted
that the stretching forth of his hands toward the moon and stars might
have been the performance of some religious rite peculiar to his own
country which was in ours misconstrued into a desire for physical
nourishment His repetition of the word googoowhich was subject to
a variety of opposite interpretationswhen taken in conjunction with
his size in my mind seemed to indicate his aboriginal or Aztec origin
I incline to this belief as it sustains the impression I have already
hinted at that his extreme youth is a simulation and deceit that he
is really older and has lived before at some remote period and that his
conduct fully justifies his title as A Venerable Impostor A variety of
circumstances corroborate this impression His tottering walk which is
a senile as well as a juvenile condition his venerable head thatched
with such imperceptible hair that at a distance it looks like a mild
aureola and his imperfect dental exhibition But beside these physical
peculiarities may be observed certain moral symptoms which go to
disprove his assumed youth He is in the habit of falling into
reveries caused I have no doubt by some circumstance which suggests
a comparison with his experience in his remoter boyhood or by some
serious retrospection of the past years He has been detected lying
awake at times when he should have been asleep engaged in curiously
comparing the bedclothes walls and furniture with some recollection
of his youth At such moments he has been heard to sing softly to
himself fragments of some unintelligible composition which probably
still linger in his memory as the echoes of a music he has long
outgrown He has the habit of receiving strangers with the familiarity
of one who had met them before and to whom their antecedents and
peculiarities were matters of old acquaintance and so unerring is
his judgment of their previous character that when he withholds his
confidence I am apt to withhold mine It is somewhat remarkable that
while the maturity of his years and the respect due to them is denied by
man his superiority and venerable age is never questioned by the brute
creation The dog treats him with a respect and consideration accorded
to none others and the cat permits a familiarity which I should shudder
to attempt It may be considered an evidence of some Pantheistic quality
in his previous education that he seems to recognize a fellowship even
in inarticulate objects he has been known to verbally address plants
flowers and fruit and to extend his confidence to such inanimate
objects as chairs and tables There can be little doubt that in the
remote period of his youth these objects were endowed with not only
sentient natures but moral capabilities and he is still in the habit
of beating them when they collide with him and of pardoning them with a
kiss
As he has grown olderrather let me say as we have approximated to his
yearshe has in spite of the apparent paradox lost much of his senile
gravity It must be confessed that some of his actions of late appear to
our imperfect comprehension inconsistent with his extreme age A habit
of marching up and down with a string tied to a sodawater bottle a
disposition to ride anything that could by any exercise of the liveliest
fancy be made to assume equine proportions a propensity to blacken his
venerable white hair with ink and coal dust and an omnivorous appetite
which did not stop at chalk clay or cinders were peculiarities not
calculated to excite respect In fact he would seem to have become
demoralized and when after a prolonged absence the other day he was
finally discovered standing upon the front steps addressing a group of
delighted children out of his limited vocabulary the circumstance could
only be accounted for as the garrulity of age
But I lay aside my pen amidst an ominous silence and the disappearance
of the venerable head from my plane of vision As I step to the other
side of the table I find that sleep has overtaken him in an overt act
of hoary wickedness The very pages I have devoted to an exposition
of his deceit he has quietly abstracted and I find them covered
with cabalistic figures and wildlooking hieroglyphs traced with his
forefinger dipped in ink which doubtless in his own language conveys
a scathing commentary on my composition But he sleeps peacefully
and there is something in his face which tells me that he has already
wandered away to that dim region of his youth where I cannot follow him
And as there comes a strange stirring at my heart when I contemplate the
immeasurable gulf which lies between us and how slight and feeble as
yet is his grasp on this world and its strange realities I find too
late that I also am a willing victim of the Venerable Impostor
FROM A BALCONY
The little stone balcony which by a popular fallacy is supposed to be
a necessary appurtenance of my window has long been to me a source of
curious interest The fact that the asperities of our summer weather
will not permit me to use it but once or twice in six months does not
alter my concern for this incongruous ornament It affects me as I
suppose the conscious possession of a linen coat or a nankeen trousers
might affect a sojourner here who has not entirely outgrown his memory
of Eastern summer heat and its glorious compensationsa luxurious
providence against a possible but by no means probable contingency I do
no longer wonder at the persistency with which San Franciscans adhere
to this architectural superfluity in the face of climatical
impossibilities The balconies in which no one sits the piazzas
on which no one lounges are timid advances made to a climate whose
churlishness we are trying to temper by an ostentation of confidence
Ridiculous as this spectacle is at all seasons it is never more so than
in that bleak interval between sunset and dark when the shrill
scream of the factory whistle seems to have concentrated all the hard
unsympathetic quality of the climate into one vocal expression Add to
this the appearance of one or two pedestrians manifestly too late for
their dinners and tasting in the shrewish air a bitter premonition of
the welcome that awaits them at home and you have one of those ordinary
views from my balcony which makes the balcony itself ridiculous
But as I lean over its balustrade tonighta night rare in its kindness
and beautyand watch the fiery ashes of my cigar drop into the abysmal
darkness below I am inclined to take back the whole of that preceding
paragraph although it cost me some labor to elaborate its polite
malevolence I can even recognize some melody in the music which comes
irregularly and fitfully from the balcony of the Museum on Market
Street although it may be broadly stated that as a general thing
the music of all museums menageries and circuses becomes greatly
demoralizedpossibly through associations with the beasts So soft and
courteous is this atmosphere that I have detected the flutter of one or
two light dresses on the adjacent balconies and piazzas and the front
parlor windows of a certain aristocratic mansion in the vicinity which
have always maintained a studious reserve in regard to the interior
tonight are suddenly thrown into the attitude of familiar disclosure A
few young people are strolling up the street with a lounging step which
is quite a relief to that usual brisk businesslike pace which the
chilly nights impose upon even the most sentimental lovers The genial
influences of the air are not restricted to the opening of shutters
and front doors other and more gentle disclosures are made no doubt
beneath this moonlight The bonnet and hat which passed beneath my
balcony a few moments ago were suspiciously close together I argued
from this that my friend the editor will probably receive any quantity
of verses for his next issue containing allusions to Luna in which
the original epithet of silver will be applied to this planet and
that a boon will be asked for the evident purpose of rhyming with
moon and for no other Should neither of the parties be equal to this
expression the pentup feelings of the heart will probably find vent
later in the evening over the piano in I Wandered by the Brookside
or When the Moon on the Lake is Beaming But it has been permitted me
to hear the fulfilment of my prophecy even as it was uttered From the
window of number Twelve Hundred and Seven gushes upon the slumberous
misty air the maddening ballad Ever of Thee while at Twelve Hundred
and Eleven the Star of the Evening rises with a chorus I am inclined
to think that there is something in the utter vacuity of the refrain
in this song which especially commends itself to the young The simple
statement Star of the evening is again and again repeated with an
imbecile relish while the adjective beautiful recurs with a steady
persistency too exasperating to dwell upon here At occasional
intervals a base voice enunciates Starr Starr as a solitary and
independent effort Sitting here in my balcony I picture the possessor
of that voice as a small stout young man standing a little apart from
the other singers with his hands behind him under his coattail and
a severe expression of countenance He sometimes leans forward with
a futile attempt to read the music over somebody elses shoulder but
always resumes his old severity of attitude before singing his part
Meanwhile the celestial subjects of this choral adoration look down upon
the scene with a tranquillity and patience which can only result from
the security with which their immeasurable remoteness invests them
I would remark that the stars are not the only topics subject to
this damnable iteration A certain popular song which contains the
statement I will not forget you mother apparently reposes all its
popularity on the constant and dreary repetition of this unimportant
information which at least produces the desired result among the
audience If the best operatic choruses are not above this weakness
the unfamiliar language in which they are sung offers less violation to
common sense
It may be parenthetically stated here that the songs alluded to above
may be found in sheet music on the top of the piano of any young
lady who has just come from boardingschool The Old ArmChair or
Woodman spare that Tree will be also found in easy juxtaposition
The latter songs are usually brought into service at the instance of
an uncle or bachelor brother whose request is generally prefaced by a
remark deprecatory of the opera and the gratuitous observation that we
are retrograding sirretrograding and that there is no music
like the old songs He sometimes condescends to accompany Marie in a
tremulous barytone and is particularly forcible in those passages where
the word repeat is written for reasons stated above When the song is
over to the success of which he feels he has materially contributed he
will inform you that you may talk of your arias and your romanzas
but for music sirmusic at which point he becomes incoherent and
unintelligible It is this gentleman who suggests China or Brattle
Street as a suitable and cheerful exercise for the social circle
There are certain amatory songs of an arch and coquettish character
familiar to these localities which the young lady being called upon
to sing declines with a bashful and tantalizing hesitation Prominent
among these may be mentioned an erotic effusion entitled Im talking
in my Sleep which when sung by a young person vivaciously and with
appropriate glances can be made to drive languishing swains to the
verge of madness Ballads of this quality afford splendid opportunities
for bold young men who by ejaculating Oh and Ah at the affecting
passages frequently gain a fascinating reputation for wildness and
scepticism
But the music which called up these parenthetical reflections has died
away and with it the slight animosities it inspired The last song has
been sung the piano closed the lights are withdrawn from the windows
and the white skirts flutter away from stoops and balconies The silence
is broken only by the rattle and rumble of carriages coming from theatre
and opera I fancy that this soundwhich seeming to be more distinct
at this hour than at any other time might be called one of the civic
voices of the nighthas certain urbane suggestions not unpleasant to
those born and bred in large cities The moon round and full gradually
usurps the twinkling lights of the city that one by one seem to fade
away and be absorbed in her superior lustre The distant Mission hills
are outlined against the sky but through one gap the outlying fog which
has stealthily invested us seems to have effected a breach and only
waits the cooperation of the laggard seabreezes to sweep down and
take the beleaguered city by assault An ineffable calm sinks over the
landscape In the magical moonlight the shottower loses its angular
outline and practical relations and becomes a minaret from whose
balcony an invisible muezzin calls the Faithful to prayer Prayer is
better than sleep But what is this A shuffle of feet on the
pavement a low hum of voices a twang of some diabolical instrument
a preliminary hem and cough Heavens it cannot be Ah yesit isit

MELONS
As I do not suppose the most gentle of readers will believe that
anybodys sponsors in baptism ever wilfully assumed the responsibility
of such a name I may as well state that I have reason to infer that
Melons was simply the nickname of a small boy I once knew If he had any
other I never knew it
Various theories were often projected by me to account for this strange
cognomen His head which was covered with a transparent down like that
which clothes very small chickens plainly permitting the scalp to show
through to an imaginative mind might have suggested that succulent
vegetable That his parents recognizing some poetical significance in
the fruits of the season might have given this name to an August child
was an Oriental explanation That from his infancy he was fond of
indulging in melons seemed on the whole the most likely particularly
as Fancy was not bred in McGinniss Court He dawned upon me as Melons
His proximity was indicated by shrill youthful voices as Ah Melons
or playfully Hi Melons or authoritatively You Melons
McGinniss Court was a democratic expression of some obstinate
and radical propertyholder Occupying a limited space between two
fashionable thoroughfares it refused to conform to circumstances but
sturdily paraded its unkempt glories and frequently asserted itself in
ungrammatical language My windowa rear room on the ground floorin
this way derived blended light and shadow from the court So low was the
windowsill that had I been the least predisposed to somnambulism it
would have broken out under such favorable auspices and I should have
haunted McGinniss Court My speculations as to the origin of the court
were not altogether gratuitous for by means of this window I once saw
the Past as through a glass darkly It was a Celtic shadow that early
one morning obstructed my ancient lights It seemed to belong to an
individual with a peacoat a stubby pipe and bristling beard He was
gazing intently at the court resting on a heavy cane somewhat in the
way that heroes dramatically visit the scenes of their boyhood As
there was little of architectural beauty in the court I came to the
conclusion that it was McGinnis looking after his property The fact
that he carefully kicked a broken bottle out of the road somewhat
strengthened me in the opinion But he presently walked away and the
court knew him no more He probably collected his rents by proxyif he
collected them at all
Beyond Melons of whom all this is purely introductory there was little
to interest the most sanguine and hopeful nature In common with all
such localities a great deal of washing was done in comparison with
the visible results There was always something whisking on the line
and always something whisking through the court that looked as if
it ought to be there A fishgeraniumof all plants kept for the
recreation of mankind certainly the greatest illusionstraggled
under the window Through its dusty leaves I caught the first glance of
Melons
His age was about seven He looked older from the venerable whiteness
of his head and it was impossible to conjecture his size as he always
wore clothes apparently belonging to some shapely youth of nineteen
A pair of pantaloons that when sustained by a single suspender
completely equipped him formed his everyday suit How with this
lavish superfluity of clothing he managed to perform the surprising
gymnastic feats it has been my privilege to witness I have never been
able to tell His turning the crab and other minor dislocations were
always attended with success It was not an unusual sight at any hour of
the day to find Melons suspended on a line or to see his venerable head
appearing above the roofs of the outhouses Melons knew the exact height
of every fence in the vicinity its facilities for scaling and the
possibility of seizure on the other side His more peaceful and quieter
amusements consisted in dragging a disused boiler by a large string
with hideous outcries to imaginary fires
Melons was not gregarious in his habits A few youth of his own age
sometimes called upon him but they eventually became abusive and their
visits were more strictly predatory incursions for old bottles and junk
which formed the staple of McGinniss Court Overcome by loneliness one
day Melons inveigled a blind harper into the court For two hours did
that wretched man prosecute his unhallowed calling unrecompensed and
going round and round the court apparently under the impression that it
was some other place while Melons surveyed him from an adjoining fence
with calm satisfaction It was this absence of conscientious motives
that brought Melons into disrepute with his aristocratic neighbors
Orders were issued that no child of wealthy and pious parentage should
play with him This mandate as a matter of course invested Melons with
a fascinating interest to them Admiring glances were cast at Melons
from nursery windows Baby fingers beckoned to him Invitations to tea
on wood and pewter were lisped to him from aristocratic backyards It
was evident he was looked upon as a pure and noble being untrammelled
by the conventionalities of parentage and physically as well as
mentally exalted above them One afternoon an unusual commotion
prevailed in the vicinity of McGinniss Court Looking from my window I
saw Melons perched on the roof of a stable pulling up a rope by which
one Tommy an infant scion of an adjacent and wealthy house was
suspended in midair In vain the female relatives of Tommy congregated
in the backyard expostulated with Melons in vain the unhappy father
shook his fist at him Secure in his position Melons redoubled his
exertions and at last landed Tommy on the roof Then it was that the
humiliating fact was disclosed that Tommy had been acting in collusion
with Melons He grinned delightedly back at his parents as if by merit
raised to that bad eminence Long before the ladder arrived that was
to succor him he became the sworn ally of Melons and I regret to say
incited by the same audacious boy chaffed his own flesh and blood
below him He was eventually taken though of course Melons escaped
But Tommy was restricted to the window after that and the companionship
was limited to Hi Melons and You Tommy and Melons to all
practical purposes lost him forever I looked afterward to see some
signs of sorrow on Melonss part but in vain he buried his grief if
he had any somewhere in his one voluminous garment
At about this time my opportunities of knowing Melons became more
extended I was engaged in filling a void in the Literature of the
Pacific Coast As this void was a pretty large one and as I was
informed that the Pacific Coast languished under it I set apart two
hours each day to this work of filling in It was necessary that I
should adopt a methodical system so I retired from the world and locked
myself in my room at a certain hour each day after coming from my
office I then carefully drew out my portfolio and read what I had
written the day before This would suggest some alteration and I would
carefully rewrite it During this operation I would turn to consult a
book of reference which invariably proved extremely interesting and
attractive It would generally suggest another and better method of
filling in Turning this method over reflectively in my mind I would
finally commence the new method which I eventually abandoned for the
original plan At this time I would become convinced that my exhausted
faculties demanded a cigar The operation of lighting a cigar usually
suggested that a little quiet reflection and meditation would be of
service to me and I always allowed myself to be guided by prudential
instincts Eventually seated by my window as before stated Melons
asserted himself though our conversation rarely went further than
Hello Mister and Ah Melons a vagabond instinct we felt in common
implied a communion deeper than words In this spiritual commingling the
time passed often beguiled by gymnastics on the fence or line always
with an eye to my window until dinner was announced and I found a more
practical void required my attention An unlooked for incident drew us
in closer relation
A seafaring friend just from a tropical voyage had presented me with
a bunch of bananas They were not quite ripe and I hung them before my
window to mature in the sun of McGinniss Court whose forcing qualities
were remarkable In the mysteriously mingled odors of ship and
shore which they diffused throughout my room there was a lingering
reminiscence of low latitudes But even that joy was fleeting and
evanescent they never reached maturity
Coming home one day as I turned the corner of that fashionable
thoroughfare before alluded to I met a small boy eating a banana
There was nothing remarkable in that but as I neared McGinniss Court I
presently met another small boy also eating a banana A third small
boy engaged in a like occupation obtruded a painful coincidence upon
my mind I leave the psychological reader to determine the exact
corelation between this circumstance and the sickening sense of loss
that overcame me on witnessing it I reached my roomand found the
bunch of bananas was gone
There was but one who knew of their existence but one who frequented
my window but one capable of the gymnastic effort to procure them
and that wasI blush to say itMelons Melons the depredatorMelons
despoiled by larger boys of his illgotten booty or reckless and
indiscreetly liberal Melonsnow a fugitive on some neighboring
housetop I lit a cigar and drawing my chair to the window sought
surcease of sorrow in the contemplation of the fishgeranium In a few
moments something white passed my window at about the level of the edge
There was no mistaking that hoary head which now represented to me only
aged iniquity It was Melons that venerable juvenile hypocrite
He affected not to observe me and would have withdrawn quietly but
that horrible fascination which causes the murderer to revisit the scene
of his crime impelled him toward my window I smoked calmly and gazed
at him without speaking He walked several times up and down the court
with a halfrigid halfbelligerent expression of eye and shoulder
intended to represent the carelessness of innocence
Once or twice he stopped and putting his arms their whole length into
his capacious trousers gazed with some interest at the additional
width they thus acquired Then he whistled The singular conflicting
conditions of John Browns body and soul were at that time beginning to
attract the attention of youth and Melonss performance of that melody
was always remarkable But today he whistled falsely and shrilly
between his teeth At last he met my eye He winced slightly but
recovered himself and going to the fence stood for a few moments
on his hands with his bare feet quivering in the air Then he turned
toward me and threw out a conversational preliminary
They is a cirkissaid Melons gravely hanging with his back to
the fence and his arms twisted around the palingsa cirkis over
yonderindicating the locality with his footwith hosses and
hossback riders They is a man wot rides six hosses to onctsix hosses
to onctand nary saddleand he paused in expectation
Even this equestrian novelty did not affect me I still kept a fixed
gaze on Melonss eye and he began to tremble and visibly shrink in his
capacious garment Some other desperate meansconversation with Melons
was always a desperate meansmust be resorted to He recommenced more
artfully
Do you know Carrots
I had a faint remembrance of a boy of that euphonious name with scarlet
hair who was a playmate and persecutor of Melons But I said nothing
Carrots is a bad boy Killed a policeman onct Wears a dirk knife in
his boots saw him today looking in your windy
I felt that this must end here I rose sternly and addressed Melons
Melons this is all irrelevant and impertinent to the case YOU took
those bananas Your proposition regarding Carrots even if I were
inclined to accept it as credible information does not alter the
material issue You took those bananas The offence under the statutes
of California is felony How far Carrots may have been accessory to the
fact either before or after is not my intention at present to discuss
The act is complete Your present conduct shows the animo furandi to
have been equally clear
By the time I had finished this exordium Melons had disappeared as I
fully expected
He never reappeared The remorse that I have experienced for the part
I had taken in what I fear may have resulted in his utter and complete
extermination alas he may not know except through these pages For
I have never seen him since Whether he ran away and went to sea to
reappear at some future day as the most ancient of mariners or whether
he buried himself completely in his trousers I never shall know I have
read the papers anxiously for accounts of him I have gone to the Police
Office in the vain attempt of identifying him as a lost child But
I never saw him or heard of him since Strange fears have sometimes
crossed my mind that his venerable appearance may have been actually the
result of senility and that he may have been gathered peacefully to his
fathers in a green old age I have even had doubts of his existence
and have sometimes thought that he was providentially and mysteriously
offered to fill the void I have before alluded to In that hope I have
written these pages
SURPRISING ADVENTURES OF MASTER CHARLES SUMMERTON
At exactly half past nine oclock on the morning of Saturday August
26 1865 Master Charles Summerton aged five years disappeared
mysteriously from his paternal residence on Folsom Street San
Francisco At twentyfive minutes past nine he had been observed by the
butcher amusing himself by going through that popular youthful
exercise known as turning the crab a feat in which he was singularly
proficient At a court of inquiry summarily held in the back parlor at
1015 Bridget cook deposed to have detected him at twenty minutes
past nine in the felonious abstraction of sugar from the pantry which
by the same token had she known what was acomin shed have never
previnted Patsey a shrillvoiced youth from a neighboring alley
testified to have seen Chowley at half past nine in front of the
butchers shop round the corner but as this young gentleman chose
to throw out the gratuitous belief that the missing child had been
converted into sausages by the butcher his testimony was received with
some caution by the female portion of the court and with downright
scorn and contumely by its masculine members But whatever might have
been the hour of his departure it was certain that from half past ten
A M until nine P M when he was brought home by a policeman Charles
Summerton was missing Being naturally of a reticent disposition he has
since resisted with but one exception any attempt to wrest from him a
statement of his whereabouts during that period That exception has been
myself He has related to me the following in the strictest confidence
His intention on leaving the doorsteps of his dwelling was to proceed
without delay to Van Diemans Land by way of Second and Market streets
This project was subsequently modified so far as to permit a visit
to Otaheite where Captain Cook was killed The outfit for his voyage
consisted of two cartickets five cents in silver a fishingline
the brass capping of a spool of cotton which in his eyes bore some
resemblance to metallic currency and a Sundayschool library ticket
His garments admirably adapted to the exigencies of any climate were
severally a straw hat with a pink ribbon a striped shirt over which
a pair of trousers uncommonly wide in comparison to their length
were buttoned striped balmoral stockings which gave his youthful legs
something of the appearance of wintergreen candy and coppertoed shoes
with iron heels capable of striking fire from any flagstone This
latter quality Master Charley could not help feeling would be of
infinite service to him in the wilds of Van Diemans Land which as
pictorially represented in his geography seemed to be deficient in
corner groceries and matches
Exactly as the clock struck the halfhour the short legs and straw
hat of Master Charles Summerton disappeared around the corner He ran
rapidly partly by way of inuring himself to the fatigues of the journey
before him and partly by way of testing his speed with that of a North
Beach car which was proceeding in his direction The conductor not
being aware of this generous and lofty emulation and being somewhat
concerned at the spectacle of a pair of very short twinkling legs so
far in the rear stopped his car and generously assisted the youthful
Summerton upon the platform From this point a hiatus of several hours
duration occurs in Charless narrative He is under the impression that
he rode out not only his two tickets but that he became subsequently
indebted to the company for several trips to and from the opposite
termini and that at last resolutely refusing to give any explanation
of his conduct he was finally ejected much to his relief on a street
corner Although as he informs us he felt perfectly satisfied with
this arrangement he was impelled under the circumstances to hurl after
the conductor an opprobrious appellation which he had ascertained
from Patsey was the correct thing in such emergencies and possessed
peculiarly exasperating properties
We now approach a thrilling part of the narrative before which most of
the adventures of the Boys Own Book pale into insignificance There
are times when the recollection of this adventure causes Master Charles
to break out in a cold sweat and he has several times since its
occurrence been awakened by lamentations and outcries in the night
season by merely dreaming of it On the corner of the street lay several
large empty sugar hogsheads A few young gentlemen disported themselves
therein armed with sticks with which they removed the sugar which
