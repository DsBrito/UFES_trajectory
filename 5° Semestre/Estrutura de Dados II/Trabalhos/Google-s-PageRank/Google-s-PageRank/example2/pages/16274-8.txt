his companions both in the mountains and as a private citizen We are

leisure hours he has been engaged dictating his life This is to

travels that has ever been written We heartily recommend THIS BOOK
to the reading community for perusal as it presents a life out of the
usual routine of business and is checkered with adventures which

THE AUTHORS PREFACE
The pages here presented to the public form a book of facts They
unfold for the student as does no other work yet extant the great
interior wilderness of the territories belonging to the United States
The scenic views though plainly colored and wrought by the hand of
an unpretending artist inasmuch as they portray a part of the North
American continent which is unsurpassed by any other country on the
face of the earth will not fail to interest the American public In
addition to this the reader is introduced to an intimate acquaintance
with the Indian races of the countries which He east and west of the
Rocky Mountains The savage warrior and hunter is presented stripped
of all the decorations with which writers of fiction have dressed
him He is seen in his ferocity and gentleness in his rascality and
nobility in his boyhood manhood and old age and in his wisdom and
ignorance The attentive reader will learn of his approximations to
truth his bundle of superstitions his acts at home and on the war
path his success while following the buffalo and engaging the wild
Rocky Mountain bear that terror of the western wilderness He will
also behold him carrying devastation to the homes of the New Mexican
settlers and freely spilling their best blood to satiate a savage
revenge He will see him attacking and massacring parties of the white
men traveling across the prairies and trace him in his savage wars
with the early settlers and frontiersmen
In order to acquire these important data that they might be added
to the pages of American history and form a reliable record it was
necessary that some brave bold and determined man should become an
actor on the scenes and among the races described Such an actor
has been and yet is Christopher Carson the Nestor of the Rocky
Mountains and it is the experience as well as the acts of his
stirring life which the following pages present
In olden times there existed in the Rocky Mountains a race
familiarly known by the name of Trappers and Hunters They are now
almost extinct Their history has not yet been written Pen paintings
drawn from the imagination founded upon distant views of their
exploits and adventures have occasionally served as do legends
to adorn a tale The volume now offered to the public gives their
history as related by one whose name as a trapper and hunter of the
Far West stands second to none by a man who for fifteen years
saw not the face of a white woman or slept under a roof who during
those long years with his rifle alone killed over two thousand
buffalo between four and five thousand deer antelope and elk
besides wild game such as bears wild turkeys prairie chickens
etc etc in numbers beyond calculation On account of their
originality daring and interest the real facts concerning this race
of trappers and hunters will be handed down to posterity as matters
belonging to history
As is the case with the Indian the race of the Simon Pure Trapper
is nearly run The advance of civilization keeping up its untiring
march to the westward is daily encroaching upon their wild haunts and
bringing the day close at hand when warrior and trapper will depart
forever to their Happy Hunting Grounds
With the extinction of the great fur companies the trappers of Olden
Time disbanded and separated
The greatest number of these men to be found at the present day
reside in the Territory of New Mexico which in the time of their
prosperity was the country where they located their head quarters In
this Territory Christopher Carson now resides His name in the Rocky
Mountains has been familiarly known for more than a quarter of a
century and from its association with the names of great explorers
and military men is now spread throughout the civilized world It has
been generally conceded and the concession has become strengthened
by time that no small share of the benefits derived from these
explorations and campaigns as well as the safety of the commands
themselves was and is due to the sagacity skill experience
advice and labor of Christopher Carson The exploring parties and
expeditions here referred to are those which he accompanied in the
capacity of chief guide and adviser
His sober habits strict honor and great regard for truth have
endeared him to all who can call him friend and among such may be
enumerated names belonging to some of the most distinguished men whose
deeds are recorded on the pages of American history His past life has
been a mystery which this book will unveil Instead of Kit Carson as
by imaginationa bold braggart and reckless improvident hero of the
riflehe will appear a retired man and one who is very reserved in
his intercourse with others This fact alone will account for the
difficulty which has hitherto attended presenting the public with an
accurate history of his life
A few years since the writer of this work first met Christopher
Carson It needed neither a second introduction nor the assistance of
a friendly panegyric to enable him to discover in Christopher Carson
those traits of manhood which are esteemed by the great and good to
be distinguishing ornaments of character This acquaintance ripened
into a friendship of the purest stamp Since then the writer has been
the intimate friend and companion of Christopher Carson at his home
in the wild scenes of the chase on the war trail and upon the field
of battle For a long period in common with hundredsand we might
with truth add thousands the writer has desired to see Christopher
Carsons wonderful career made public for the world of readers but
while this idea was germinating in his brain he did not for an
instant flatter himself that the pleasant task would ever be assigned
to him Finally however at the urgent solicitation of many personal
friends Christopher Carson dictated the facts upon which this book
is written They were then placed in the writers hands with
instructions to add to them such information as had fallen under his
observation during quite extensive travels over a large part of the
wide expanse of country which has been Christopher Carsons theatre
for action
The book is a book of solid truth therefore the faults in the style
arrangement and composition become affairs of minor consideration
For this reason the writer makes no apologies to embarrass the
critics
Christopher Carson physically is small in stature but of compact
framework He has a large and finely developed head a twinkling
grey eye and hair of a sandy color which he wears combed back a la
Franklin mode His education having been much neglected in his
youth he is deficient in theoretical learning By natural abilities
however he has greatly compensated for this defect He speaks the
French and Spanish languages fluently besides being a perfect master
of several Indian dialects In Indian customs their manners habits
and the groundwork of their conduct no man on the American continent
is better skilled
The writer while on a foreign tour once had the opportunity and
pleasure of hearing Gordon Cumming and other hunters of less note
discourse on their hunting exploits furthermore in our own country
while seated around campfires and in log houses he has listened to
the adventures of ancient and modern Nimrods in the chase besides
these facts he has both seen and read much of hunting exploits but
no hunter ever filled his fancy so perfectly as does Christopher
Carson a man who acts and never boasts
Without further comment the reader is presented with the work while
the writer cherishes the hope that the facts which for the first
time are given to the world will prove to be both interesting and
important as jottings of history
The author begs leave to return to his friend C HATCH SMITH AM
of Brooklyn New York his acknowledgment for valuable assistance in
revising correcting and arranging his manuscript

It is now a wellestablished fact that no State in the American Union
has given birth to so many distinguished pioneers and explorers of
its boundless Territories as the commonwealth of Kentucky An Author
whose task is to tell of a Hero his bravery endurance privations
integrity selfdenial and deeds of daring carries the morale with
which to gain at once for these characteristics the assent of the
reader by the simple assertion My Hero was born a Kentuckian
Indeed in America to be a native of the State of Kentucky is to
inherit all the attributes of a brave man a safe counsellor and a
true friend It is at least certain that this State whether the
fact is due to its inland and salubrious climate or to its habits of
physical training has added many a Hero unto humanity
Christopher Carson by his countrymen familiarly called Kit Carson
was born in the County of Madison State of Kentucky on the 24th day
of December 1809 The Carson family were among the first settlers
of Kentucky and became owners of fine farms Besides being an
industrious and skillful farmer the father of Kit Carson was a
celebrated hunter When the Indians of Kentucky became quieted down
putting an end to the calls upon his courage and skill as a woodsman
he settled into a simple respectable farmer This monotonous life
did not suit his disposition and as the tide of emigration into the
wilds of Missouri was then commencing where both game and the red man
still roamed he resolved to migrate in that direction It was only
one year after the birth of his son Christopher that Mr Carson sold
his estate in Kentucky and established himself with his large family
in that part of the State of Missouri now known as Howard County At
this time Howard County Missouri was a wilderness on the remote
American frontier At his new home the father was in his element His
reputation of carrying an unerring rifle and always enacting the deeds
of a brave man was not long in following him into this wilderness
Mr Carsons only assistant on his first arrival in Howard County
was his eldest son Moses Carson who was afterwards settled in the
State of California where he resided twentyfive years before the
great California gold discovery was made
For two or three years after arriving at their new home the Carson
family with a few neighbors lived in a picketed log fort and when
they were engaged in agricultural pursuits working their farms and
so forth it was necessary to plough sow and reap under guard
men being stationed at the sides and extremities of their fields to
prevent the working party from being surprised and massacred by wild
and hostile savages who infested the country At this time the small
pox that disease which has proved such a terrible scourge to the
Indian had but seldom visited him1
Footnote 1 This disease has probably been the worst enemy with which
the red man of America has had to contend By terrible experience he
has become familiarized with its ravages and has resorted to the most
desperate remedies for its cure Among many tribes the afflicted are
obliged to form camps by themselves and thus left alone they die by
scores One of their favorite remedies when the scourge first makes
its appearance is to plunge into the nearest river by which they
think to purify themselves This course however in reality tends
to shorten their existence When the small pox rages among the
Aborigines a most unenviable position is held by their Medicine
Man He is obliged to give a strict account of himself and if so
unfortunate as to lose a chief or other great personage is sure
to pay the penalty by parting with his own life The duties of the
Medicine Man among the Indians are so mixed up with witchcraft
and jugglery so filled with the pretence of savage quackery so
completely rude and unfounded as to principle that it is impossible
to define the practice for any useful end About five years since a
young gentleman of scientific habits who was attached to an exploring
party accidentally became separated from his companions In his
wanderings he fell in with a band of hostile Sioux Indians who
would quickly have dispatched him had he not succeeded immediately
in convincing them of his wonderful powers It so happened that this
gentleman was well informed in the theory of vaccination and it
struck him that by impressing on the savages his skill he might
extricate himself By the aid of signs a lancet and some virus he
set himself to work and soon saw that he had gained a reputation
which saved him his scalp He first vaccinated his own arm after
which all of the Indians present solicited his magic touch to save
them from the loathsome disease The result was that he found he had
enlisted himself in an active practice After a few days the Indians
were delighted with the results and began to look upon their prisoner
as possessed of superhuman knowledge They feared to do him injury
and finally resolved to let him go of which privilege it is almost
unnecessary to say he was delighted to avail himself and was not
long in finding his friends
The incidents which enliven and add interest to the historic page
have proved of spontaneous and vigorous growth in the new settlements
of America Nearly every book which deals with the early planting and
progress of the American colonists and pioneers contains full and
frequently glowing descriptions of exploits in the forest strifes of
the hunter fights with the savages fearful and terrible surprises of
lurking warriors as they arouse the brave settler and his family
from their midnight dreams by the wild deathannouncing warwhoop
hairbreadth escapes from the larger kinds of game boldly bearded in
their lair the manly courage which never yields but surmounts every
obstacle presented by the unbroken and boundless forest all these
are subjects and facts which have already so many counterparts in
