There are many causes why those who have written upon America have
fallen into error they have represented the Americans as a nation now
they are not yet nor will they for many years be in the true sense of
the word a nationthey are a mass of many people cemented together to
a certain degree by a general form of government but they are in a
state of transition and what may at first appear strange no
amalgamation as has yet taken place the puritan of the east the Dutch
descent of the middle states the cavalier of the south are nearly as
marked and distinct now as at the first occupation of the country
softened down indeed but still distinct  Not only are the populations
of the various states distinct but even those of the cities and it is
hardly possible to make a remark which may be considered as general to a
country where the varieties of soil and of climate are so extensive
Even on that point upon which you might most safely venture to
generalise namely the effect of a democratical form of government upon
the mass your observations must be taken with some exceptions arising
from the climate manners and customs and the means of livelihood so
differing in this extended country
Indeed the habit in which travellers indulge of repeating facts which
have taken place of having taken place in America has perhaps
unintentionally on their part very much misled the English reader  It
would hardly be considered fair if the wilder parts of Ireland and the
disgraceful acts which are committed there were represented as
characteristic of England or the British empire yet between London and
Connaught there is less difference than between the most civilised and
intellectual portion of America such as Boston and Philadelphia and
the wild regions and wilder inhabitants of the west of the Mississippi
and Arkansas where reckless beings compose a scattered population
residing too far for the law to reach or where if it could reach the
power of the government would prove much too weak to enforce obedience
to it  To do justice to all parties America should be examined and
portrayed piecemeal every state separately for every state is
different running down the scale from refinement to a state of
barbarism almost unprecedented but each presenting matter for
investigation and research and curious examples of cause and effect
Many of those who have preceded me have not been able to devote
sufficient time to their object and therefore have failed  If you have
passed through a strange country totally differing in manners and
customs and language from your own you may give your readers some idea
of the contrast and the impressions made upon you by what you saw even
if you have travelled in haste or sojourned there but a few days but
when the similarity in manners customs and language is so great that
you may imagine yourself to be in your own country it requires more
research a greater degree of acumen and a fuller investigation of
cause and effect than can be given in a few months of rapid motion
Moreover English travellers have apparently been more active in
examining the interior of houses than the public path from which they
should have drawn their conclusions they have searched with the
curiosity of a woman instead of examining and surveying with the eye of
a philosopher  Following up this wrong track has been the occasion of
much indiscretion and injustice on their parts and of justifiably
indignant feeling on the part of the Americans  By many of the writers
on America the little discrepancies the mere trifles of custom have
been dwelt upon with a sarcastic illnatured severity to give their
works that semblance of pith in which in reality they were miserably
deficient and they violated the rights of hospitality that they might
increase their interest as authors
The Americans are often themselves the cause of their being
misrepresented there is no country perhaps in which the habit of
deceiving for amusement or what is termed hoaxing is so common
Indeed this and the hyperbole constitute the major part of American
humour  If they have the slightest suspicion that a foreigner is about
to write a book nothing appears to give them so much pleasure as to try
to mislead him this has constantly been practised upon me and for all
I know they may in some instances have been successful if they have
all I can say of the story is that se non e vero e si ben trovato
that it might have happened  Note 1
When I was at Boston a gentleman of my acquaintance brought me Miss
Martineaus work and was excessively delighted when he pointed out to
me two pages of fallacies which he had told her with a grave face and
which she had duly recorded and printed  This practice added to
another that of attempting to conceal for the Americans are aware of
many of their defects has been with me productive of good results it
has led me to much close investigation and has made me very cautious in
asserting what has not been proved to my own satisfaction to be worthy
of credibility
Another difficulty and cause of misrepresentation is that travellers
are not aware of the jealousy existing between the inhabitants of the
different states and cities  The eastern states pronounce the
southerners to be choleric reckless regardless of law and indifferent
as to religion while the southerners designate the eastern states as a
nursery of overreaching pedlars selling clocks and wooden nutmegs
This running into extremes is produced from the clashing of their
interests as producers and manufacturers  Again Boston turns up her
erudite nose at New York Philadelphia in her pride looks down upon
both New York and Boston while New York clinking her dollars swears
the Bostonians are a parcel of puritanical prigs and the Philadelphians
a wouldbe aristocracy  A western man from Kentucky when at the
Tremont House in Boston begged me particularly not to pay attention to
what they said of his state in that quarter  Both a Virginian and
Tennessean when I was at New York did the same
At Boston I was drinking champaign at a supper  Are you drinking
champaign said a young Bostonian  Thats New Yorktake claret or
if you will drink champaign pour it into a green glass and they will
think it hock champaign is not right  How are we to distinguish
between right and wrong in this queer world  At New York they do drink
a great deal of champaign it is the small beer of the dinnertable
Champaign become associated with New York and therefore is not right
I will do the New Yorkers the justice to say that as far as drinks
are concerned they are above prejudice alls right with them provided
theres enough of it
The above remarks will testify that travellers in America have great
difficulties to contend with and that their channels of information
have been chiefly those of the drawingroom or dinnertable  Had I
worked through the same I should have found then very difficult of
access for the Americans had determined that they would no longer
extend their hospitality to those who returned it with ingratitudenor
can they be blamed  Let us reverse the case  Were not the doors of
many houses in England shut against an American author when from his
want of knowledge of conventional usage he published what never
should have appeared in print  And should another return to England
after his tetchy absurd remarks upon the English is there much chance
of his receiving a kind welcome  Most assuredly not both these authors
will be received with caution  The Americans therefore are not only
not to blame but would prove themselves very deficient in a proper
respect for themselves if they again admitted into their domestic
circles those who eventually requited them with abuse
Admitting this of course I have no feelings of illwill toward them for
any want of hospitality toward me on the contrary I was pleased with
the neglect as it left me free and unshackled from any real or fancied
claims which the Americans might have made upon me on that score
Indeed I had not been three weeks in the country before I decided upon
accepting no more invitations even charily as they were made  I found
that although invited my presence was a restraint upon the company
every one appeared afraid to speak and when anything ludicrous
occurred the cry would beOh now  Captain Marryat dont put that
into your book  More than once when I happened to be in large
parties a question such as follows would be put to me by some free and
enlightened individual
Now Captain Marryat I ask you before this company and I trust you
will give me a categorical answer Are you or are you not about to
write a book upon this country  I hardly need observe to the English
reader that under such circumstances the restraint became mutual I
declined all farther invitations and adhered to this determination as
far as I could without cause of offence during my whole tour through
the United States
But if I admit that after the usage which they had received the
Americans are justified in not again tendering their hospitably to the
English I cannot at the same time but express my opinion as to their
conduct toward me personally  They had no right to insult and annoy me
in the manner they did from nearly one end of the Union to the other
either because my predecessors had expressed an unfavourable opinion of
them before my arrival or because they expected that I would do the
same upon my return to my own country I remark upon this conduct not
from any feeling of illwill or desire of retaliation but to compel the
Americans to admit that I am under no obligations to them that I
received from them much more of insult and outrage than of kindness
and consequently that the charge of ingratitude cannot be laid to my
door however offensive to them some of the remarks in this work may
happen to be
And here I must observe that the Americans can no longer anticipate
lenity from the English traveller as latterly they have so deeply
committed themselves  Once indeed they could say We admit and are
hospitable to the English who as soon as they leave our country turn
round and abuse and revile us  We have our faults it is true but such
conduct on their part is not kind or generous  But they can say this
no longer they have retaliated and in their attacks they have been
regardless of justice  The three last works upon the Americans written
by English authors were on the whole favourable to them Mr Powers
and Mr Grunds most decidedly so and Miss Martineaus filled as it is
with absurdities and fallacies was intended at all events to be
favourable
In opposition to them we have Mr Coopers remarks upon England in
which my countrymen are certainly not spared and since that
publication we have another of much greater importance written by Mr
Carey of Philadelphia not indeed in a strain of vituperation or
illfeeling but asserting and no doubt to his own satisfaction and
that of his countrymen proving that in every important point that is
to say under the heads of Security of Person and Property of Morals
Education Religion Industry Invention Credit and consequently
Honesty America is in advance of England and every other nation in
Europe  The tables then are turned it is no longer the English but
the Americans who are the assailants and such being the case I beg
that it may be remembered that many of the remarks which will
subsequently appear in this work have been forced from me by the attacks
made upon my nation by the American authors and that if I am compelled
to draw comparisons it is not with the slightest wish to annoy or
humiliate the Americans but in legitimate and justifiable defence of my
own native land
America is a wonderful country endowed by the Omnipotent with natural
advantages which no other can boast of and the mind can hardly
calculate upon the degree of perfection and power to which whether the
states are eventually separated or not it may in the course of two
centuries arrive  At present all is energy and enterprise everything
is in a state of transition but of rapid improvementso rapid indeed
that those who would describe America now would have to correct all in
the short space of ten years for ten years in America is almost equal
to a century in the old continent  Now you may pass through a wild
forest where the elk browses and the panther howls in ten years that
very forest with its denizens will most likely have disappeared and
in their place you will find towns with thousands of inhabitants with
arts manufactures and machinery all in full activity
In reviewing America we must look upon it as showing the development of
the English character under a new aspect arising from a new state of
things  If I were to draw a comparison between the English and the
Americans I should say that there is almost as much difference between
the two nations at this present time as there has long been between the
English and the Dutch  The latter are considered by us as phlegmatic
and slow and we may be considered the same compared with our energetic
descendants  Time to an American is everything Note 2 and space he
attempts to reduce to a mere nothing  By the steamboats railroads
and the wonderful facilities of watercarriage a journey of five
hundred miles is as little considered in America as would be here a
journey from London to Brighton  Go ahead is the real motto of the
country and every man does push on to gain in advance of his
neighbour  The American lives twice as long as others for he does
twice the work during the time that he lives  He begins life sooner at
fifteen he is considered a man plunges into the stream of enterprise
floats and struggles with his fellows  In every trifle an American
shows the value he puts upon time  He rises early eats his meals with
the rapidity of a wolf and is the whole day at his business  If he be
a merchant his money whatever it may amount to is seldom invested it
is all floatinghis accumulations remain active and when he dies his
wealth has to be collected from the four quarters of the globe
Now all this energy and activity is of English origin and were England
expanded into America the same results would be produced  To a certain
degree the English were in former times what the Americans are now
and this it is which has raised our country so high in the scale of
nations but since we have become so closely packedso crowded that
there is hardly room for the population our activity has been
proportionably cramped and subdued  But in this vast and favoured
country the very associations and impressions of childhood foster and
enlighten the intellect and precociously rouse the energies  The wide
expanse of territory already occupiedthe vast and magnificent rivers
the boundless regions yet remaining to be peopledthe rapidity of
communicationthe dispatch with which everything is effected are
evident almost to the child  To those who have rivers many thousand
miles in length the passage across the Atlantic of 3500 miles
appears but a trifle and the American ladies talk of spending the
winter at Paris with as much indifference as one of our landed
proprietors would of going up to London for the season
We must always bear in mind the peculiar and wonderful advantages of
country when we examine America and its form of government for the
country has had more to do with upholding this democracy than people
might at first imagine  Among the advantages of democracy the greatest
is perhaps that all start fair and the boy who holds the
travellers horse as Van Buren is said to have done may become the
president of the United States  But it is the country and not the
government which has been productive of such rapid strides as have been
made by America  Indeed it is a query whether the form of government
would have existed down to this day had it not been for the advantages
derived from the vast extent and boundless resources of the territory in
which it was established  Let the American direct his career to any
goal he pleases his energies are unshackled and in the race the best
man must win  There is room for all and millions more  Let him choose
his professionhis career is not checked or foiled by the excess of
those who have already embarked in it  In every department there is an
opening for talent and for those inclined to work work is always to be
procured  You have no complaint in this country that every profession
is so full that it is impossible to know what to do with your children
There is a vast field and all may receive the reward due for their
labour
In a country where the ambition and energies of man have been roused to
such an extent the great point is to find out worthy incitements for
ambition to feed upon  A virtue undirected into a wrong channel may by
circumstances prove little better than even if it does not sink down
into actual vice  Hence it is that a democratic form of government is
productive of such demoralising effects  Its rewards are few  Honours
of every description which stir up the soul of man to noble deeds
worthy incitements they have none  The only compensation they can
offer for services is money and the only distinctionthe only means of
raising himself above his fellows left to the Americanis wealth
consequently the acquisition of wealth has become the great spring of
action  But it is not sought after with the avarice to hoard but with
the ostentation to expend  It is the effect of ambition directed into a
wrong channel  Each man would surpass his neighbour and the only great
avenue open to all and into which thousands may press without much
jostling of each other is that which leads to the shrine of Mammon  It
is our nature to attempt to raise ourselves above our fellowmen it is
the mainspring of existencethe incitement to all that is great and
virtuous or great and vicious  In America but a small portion can
raise themselves or find rewards for superior talent but wealth is
attainable by all and having no aristocracy no honours no
distinctions to look forward to wealth has become the substitute and
with very few exceptions every man is great in proportion to his
riches  The consequence is that to leave a sum of money when they die
is of little importance to the majority of the Americans  Their object
is to amass it while young and obtain the consideration which it gives
them during their lifetime
The society in the United States is that which must naturally be
expected in a new country where there are few men of leisure and the
majority are working hard to obtain that wealth which almost alone gives
importance under a democratic form of government  You will find
intellectual and gentlemanlike people in America but they are scattered
here and there  The circle of society is not complete wherever you go
you will find an admixture sudden wealth having admitted those who but
a few years back were in humble circumstances and in the constant state
of transition which takes place in this country it will be half a
century perhaps before a select circle of society can be collected
together in any one city or place  The improvement is rapid but the
vast extent of country which has to be peopled prevents that improvement
from being manifest  The stream flows inland and those who are here
today are gone tomorrow and their places in society filled up by
others who ten years back had no prospect of ever being admitted  All
is transition the waves follow one another to the far west the froth
and scum boiling in the advance
America is indeed well worth the study of the philosopher  A vast
nation forming society ever changing all in motion and activity
nothing complete the old continent pouring in her surplus to supply the
loss of the eastern states all busy as a hive full of energy and
activity  Every year multitudes swarm off from the east like bees not
the young only but the old quitting the closebuilt cities society
and refinement to settle down in some lone spot in the vast prairies
where the rich soil offers to them the certain prospect of their
families and children being one day possessed of competency and wealth
To write upon America as a nation would be absurd for nation
properly speaking it is not but to consider it in its present chaotic
state is well worth the labour  It would not only exhibit to the
living a somewhat new picture of the human mind but as a curious page
in the Philosophy of History it would hereafter serve as a subject of
review for the Americans themselves
It is not my intention to follow the individualising plans of the
majority of those who have preceded me in this country  I did not sail
across the Atlantic to ascertain whether the Americans eat their dinners
with twoprong iron or threeprong silver forks with chopsticks or
their fingers it is quite sufficient for me to know that they do eat
and drink if they did not it would be a curious anomaly which I should
not pass over  My object was to examine and ascertain what were the
effects of a democratic form of government and climate upon a people
which with all its foreign admixture may still be considered as
English
It is a fact that our virtues and our vices depend more upon
circumstances than upon ourselves and there are no circumstances which
operate so powerfully upon us as government and climate  Let it not be
supposed that in the above assertion I mean to extenuate vice or
imply that we are not free agents  Naturally prone to vices in general
circumstances will render us more prone to one description of vice than
to another but that is no reason why we should not be answerable for
it since it is our duty to guard against the besetting sin  But as an
agent in this point the form of government under which we live is
perhaps the most powerful in its effects and thus we constantly hear
of vices peculiar to a country when it ought rather to be said of
vices peculiar to a government
Never perhaps was the foundation of a nation laid under such
peculiarly favourable auspices as that of America  The capital they
commenced with was industry activity and courage  They had moreover
the advantage of the working of genius and wisdom and the records of
history as a beacon and a guide the trial of ages as to the
respective merits of the various governments to which men have
submitted the power to select the merits from the demerits in each a
boundless extent of country rich in everything that could be of
advantage to man and they were led by those who where really giants in
those days a body of men collected and acting together forming an
aggregate of wisdom and energy such as probably will not for centuries
be seen again  Never was there such an opportunity of testing the
merits of a republic of ascertaining if such a form of government could
be maintainedin fact of proving whether an enlightened people could
govern themselves  And it must be acknowledged that the work was well
begun Washington when his career had closed left the country a pure
republic  He did all that man could do  Miss Martineau asserts that
America has solved the great problem that a republic can exist for
fifty years but such is not the case  America has proved that under
peculiar advantages a people can govern themselves for fifty years but
if you put the question to an enlightened American and ask him Were
Washington to rise from his grave would he recognise the present
government of America as the one bequeathed to them and the American
will himself answer in the negative  These fifty years have afforded
another proof were it necessary how shortsighted and fallible are
menhow impossible it is to keep anything in a state of perfection here
below  Washington left America as an infant nation a pure and I may
add a virtuous republic but the government of the country has
undergone as much change as everything else and it has now settled down
into anything but a pure democracy  Nor could it be otherwise a
republic may be formed and may continue in healthy existence when
regulated by a small body of men but as men increase and multiply so do
they deteriorate the closer they are packed the more vicious they
become and consequently the more vicious become their institutions
Washington and his coadjutors had no power to control the nature of man
It may be inquired by some what difference there is between a republic
and a democracy as the terms have been and are often used
indifferently  I know not whether my distinction is right but I
consider that when those possessed of most talent and wisdom are
selected to act for the benefit of a people with full reliance upon
their acting for the best and without any shackle or pledge being
enforced we may consider that form of government as a republic ruled by
the most enlightened and capable but that if on the contrary those
selected by the people to represent them are not only bound by the
pledges previous to their election but ordered by the mass how to vote
after their election then the country is not ruled by the collected
wisdom of the people but by the majority who are as often wrong as
right and then the governing principle sinks into a democracy as it
now is in America  Note 3
It is singular to remark notwithstanding her monarchical form of
government how much more republican England is in her institutions than
America  Ask an American what he considers the necessary qualifications
of a president and after intellectual qualification he will tell you
firmness decision and undaunted courage and it is really an enigma to
him although he will not acknowledge it how the sceptre of a country
like England subject to the monarchical sway which he detests can be
held in the hand of a young female of eighteen years of age
But upon one point I have made up my mind which is that with all its
imperfections democracy is the form of government best suited to the
present condition of America in so far as it is the one under which
the country has made and will continue to make the most rapid
advances  That it must eventually be changed is true but the times of
its change must be determined by so many events hidden in futurity
which may accelerate or retard the convulsion that it would be
presumptuous for any one to attempt to name a period when the present
form of government shall be broken up and the multitude shall separate
and reembody themselves under new institutions
In the arrangement of this work I have considered it advisable to
present first to the reader those portions of my diary which may be
interesting and in which are recorded traits and incidents which will
bear strongly upon the commentaries I shall subsequently make upon the
institutions of the United States and the results of those institutions
as developed in the American character  Having been preceded by so many
writers on America I must occasionally tread in wellbeaten tracts
but although I shall avoid repetition as much as possible this will
not prevent me from describing what I saw or felt  Different ideas and
different associations of ideas will strike different travellers as
the same landscape may wear a new appearance according as it is viewed
in the morning by noon or at night the outlines remain the same but
the lights and shadows and tints are reflected from the varying
idiosyncrasy of various minds
My readers will also find many quotations either embodied in the work
or supplied by notes  This I have considered necessary that my
opinions may be corroborated but these quotations will not be extracted
so much from the works of English as from American writers  The
opinions relative to the United States have been so conflicting in the
many works which have been written that I consider it most important
that I should be able to quote American authorities against themselves
and strengthen my opinions and arguments by their own admissions
Note 1  Paragraph from a New York paper  That old deaf English
maiden lady Miss Martineau who travelled through some of the states a
few years since gives a full account of Mr Poindexters death
unfortunately for her veracity the gentleman still lives but this is
about as near the truth as the majority of her statements  The
loafing English men and women who visit America as pennyaliners
are perfectly understood here and Jonathan amuses himself whenever he
meets them by imposing upon their credulity the most absurd stories
which he can invent which they swallow whole go home with their eyes
sticking out of their heads with wonder and print all they have heard
for the benefit of John Bulls calves
Note 2  The clocks in Americathere rendered so famous by Sam Slick
instead of the moral lessons inculcated by the dials in this country
such as Time flies etcetera teach one more suited to American
feelingTime is money
Note 3  And in this opinion I find that I am borne out by an American
writer who saysIt is true indeed that the American government
which as first set up was properly republicanthat is representation
in a course of salutary degrees and with salutary checks upon the
popular will on the powers of legislation of the executive and the
judiciarywas assailed at an early period of its history and has been
assailed continuously down to the present time by a power called
democracy and that this power has been constantly acquiring influence
and gaining ascendency in the republic during the term of its
historyA Voice from America to England by an American Gentleman

VOLUME ONE CHAPTER ONE
I like to begin at the beginning its a good old fashion not
sufficiently adhered to in these modern times  I recollect a young
gentleman who said he was thinking of going to America on my asking
him how he intended to go he replied I dont exactly know but I
think I shall take the fast coach  I wished him a safe passage and
said I was afraid he would find it very dusty  As I could not find
the office to book myself by this young gentlemans conveyance I walked
down to St Katherines Docks went on board a packet was shewn into a
superb cabin fitted up with birdseye maple mahogany and
lookingglasses and communicating with certain small cabins where
there was a sleeping berth for each passenger about as big as that
allowed to a pointer in a dogkennel  I thought that there was more
finery than comfort but it ended in my promising the captain to meet
him at Portsmouth  He was to sail from London on the 1st of April and
I did not choose to sail on that dayit was ominous so I embarked at
Portsmouth on the 3rd  It is not my intention to give a description of
crossing the Atlantic but as the reader may be disappointed if I do not
tell him how I got over I shall first inform him that we were
thirtyeight in the cabin and 160 men women and children literally
stowed in bulk in the steerage  I shall describe what took place from
the time I first went up the side at Spithead until the ship was under
weigh and then make a very short passage of it
At 930 amEmbarked on board the good ship Quebec and a good ship
she proved to be repeatedly going nine and ahalf knots on a bowling
sails lifting  Captain Hquite delighted to see meall captains of
packets are to see passengers I believed him when he said so
At 950Sheriffs officer as usual came on board  Observed several
of the cabin passengers hasten down below and one who requested the
captain to stow him away  But it was not a penandink affair it was a
case of burglary  The officer has found his man in the steeragethe
handcuffs are on his wrists and they are rowing him ashore  His wife
and two children are on board her lips quiver as she collects her
baggage to follow her husband  One halfhour more and he would have
escaped from justice and probably have led a better life in a far
country where his crimes were unknown  By the bye Greenacre the man
who cut the woman up was taken out of the ship as she went down the
river he had very nearly escaped  What cargoes of crime folly and
recklessness do we yearly ship off to America  America ought to be very
much obliged to us
The women of the steerage are persuading the wife of the burglar not to
go on shore their arguments are strong but not strong enough against
the devoted love of a womanYour husband is certain to be hung
whats the use of following him  Your passage is paid and you will
have no difficulty in supporting your children in America  But she
rejects the advicegoes down the side and presses her children to her
breast as overcome with the agony of her feelings she drops into the
boat and now that she is away from the ship you hear the sobs which
can no longer be controlled
10 amAll hands up anchor
I was repeating to myself some of the stanzas of Mrs Nortons Heres a
Health to the Outwardbound when I cast my eyes forward
