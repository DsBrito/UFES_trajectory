inhabitants say by the misconduct of the king who having increased
in levity and licentiousness to such a frightful degree as even to
marry his own daughter God Almighty caused Saboon the prince of
Wadai to march against him and destroy him laying waste at the
same time all his country and leaving the houses uninhabited as a
signal chastisement for his impiety
Major Denham having applied for the covering of the above warrior and
his horse in his journal thus describes their arrivalAug 11 Soon
after daylight Karouash with Hadgi Mustapha the chief of the
Shouaas and the Sheikhs two nephews Hassein and Kanemy came to our
huts They were attended by more than a dozen slaves bearing presents
for us for King George and the consul at Tripoli I had applied for a
lebida horsecovering after seeing those taken from the Begharmis
the sheikh now sent a man clothed in a yellow wadded jacket with a
scarlet cap and mounted on the horse taken from the Begharmis on which
the sultans eldest son rode He was one of the finest horses I had
seen and covered with a scarlet cloth also wadded Every thing
Hadgi Mustapha said except the man is to be taken to your great
king
The Begharmis it will be seen were conquered by the people of Kanem
and Major Denham has translated and given in the appendix to his
Travels a song of thanksgiving on the triumphant return of the
governor full of the characteristic beauty and simplicity of savage
life In these struggles it would appear the law of nations is severe on
the weakest for the son of the late sultan of the Begharmis is
described as now a slave of the sheikh of Bornou So wags the world

MOHAMMEDAN SUPERSTITION
The eastern and all Mohammedan people considering Alexander the Great
as the only monarch who conquered the globe from east to west give him
the title of the two horned in allusion to his said conquests They
likewise believe that Gog and Magog were two great nations but that in
consequence of their wicked and mischievous disposition Alexander
gathered and immured them within two immensely high mountains in the
darkest and northernmost parts of Europe by a most surprising and
insuperable wall made of iron and copper of great thickness and
height and that to the present time they are confined there that
notwithstanding they are a dwarfish raceviz from two to three feet
in height onlythey will one day come out and desolate the world As
Lord Mayors Day is just approaching perhaps some of the visiters of
Gog and Magog on that occasion may decide this matter It is almost akin

LIVING IN GENEVA
The vicinity of Geneva appears peculiarly eligible for the permanent
residence of an English family There is perhaps no town on the
continent where greater facilities are afforded for a man of literary
and scientific pursuits to indulge his taste or to increase his
knowledge The city is close built and consequently not an agreeable
place to live in but its immediate environs abound with delightful
spots
The costume of the Genevese assimilates much with that of the French
but the better class of females are partial to the English fashions The
language of the country is French but its habits and religion are
widely different Not only does the Protestant faith find here the
salutary prevalence of a kindred faith but the members of our own
ecclesiastical establishment are enabled to join each other every
Sabbath day in the worship of God and at stated seasons to receive the
holy sacrament according to the pure and apostolic ritual of the church
of England
The expense of a house with a garden and piece of land within a mile
of the gates including also the keeping of a caleche and pair of
horses for a gentleman his lady two children and three servants
does not exceed 300 l a year and with this he is enabled to receive his
friends occasionally and in a respectable style To proceed from a
family establishment to a bachelors pension I says Mr Seth
Stevenson in his Continental Travels was told that a person
at Petit Saconnex has a sleepingroom to himself and his breakfast
dinner tea and supper with the family for 500 francs 20 l 16 s 8 d

The taxation of Geneva is described as very trifling There is a sort of
incometax to which every man of property contributes on his honour
as to the amount of that property The whole tax for horses and
carriages amounts to about 18 d for each person the richest it seems
pays no more and the others pay no less My friend assures me
continues Mr S that his fellow citizens approve of their annexation
to Switzerland and also of the union of the Valais with the Helvetic
confederationthat the people of this little republic are flourishing
again contented with their government and as the best proof of their
returning prosperity since the peace he adverted to the comparatively
few indigent or distressed persons among them and to the fact of there
being only fortyfive persons in the poors hospital besides those

ORIGINAL STORY OF HAMLET
From the Latin of Saxo Grammaticus but interspersed
Florwendillus king of Jutland married Geruthra or Gertrude the only
daughter of Ruric king of Denmark The produce of this union was a son
called Amlettus When he grew towards manhood his spirit and
extraordinary abilities excited the envy and hatred of his uncle who
before the birth of Amlettus was regarded as presumptive heir to the
crown Fengo which was the name of this haughty prince conceived a
passion for his sisterinlaw the queen and meeting with reciprocal
feelings they soon arranged a plan which putting into execution he
ascended the throne of his brother and espoused the widowed princess
Amlettus or Hamlet suspecting that his father had died by the hand
or the devices of his uncle determined to be revenged But perceiving
the jealousy with which the usurper eyed his superior talents and the
better to conceal his hatred and intentions he affected a gradual
derangement of reason and at last acted all the extravagance of an
absolute madman Fengos guilt induced him to doubt the reality of a
malady so favourable to his security and suspicious of some direful
project being hidden beneath assumed insanity he tried by different
stratagems to penetrate the truth One of these was to draw him into a
confidential interview with a young damsel who had been the companion
of his infancy but Hamlets sagacity and the timely caution of his
intimate friend frustrated this design In these two persons we may
recognise the Ophelia and Horatio of Shakspeare A second plot was
attended with equal want of success It was concerted by Fengo that the
queen should take her son to task in a private conversation vainly
flattering himself that the prince would not conceal his true state from
the pleadings of a mother Shakspeare has adopted every part of this
scene not only the precise situation and circumstances but the
sentiments and sometimes the very words themselves The queens
apartment was the appointed place of conference where the king to
secure certain testimony had previously ordered one of his courtiers to
conceal himself under a heap of straw so says the historian and
though Shakspeare in unison with the refinement of more modern times
changes that rustic covering for the royal tapestry yet it was even as
Saxo Grammaticus relates it In those primitive ages straw hay of
rushes strewed on the floor were the usual carpets in the chambers of
the great One of our Henrys in making a progress to the north of
England previously sent forward a courier to order clean straw
at every house where he was to take his lodging But to return to the
subject
The prince suspecting there might be a concealed listener and that it
was the king pursued his wild and frantic acts hoping that by some
lucky chance he might discover his hidingplace Watchful of all that
passed in the room as he dashed from side to side he descried a little
movement of the uneasy courtiers covering Suddenly Hamlet sprung on
his feet began to crow like a cock and flapping his arms against his
sides leaped upon the straw feeling something under him he snatched
out his sword and thrust it through the unfortunate lord The barbarism
of the times is most shockingly displayed in the brutal manner in which
he treats the dead body but for the honour of the Danish prince we
must suppose that it was not merely a wanton act but done the more
decidedly to convince the king when the strange situation of the corpse
was seen how absolutely he must be divested of reason Being assured he
was now alone with his mother in a most awful manner he turns upon her
and avows his madness to be assumed he reproaches her with her wicked
deeds and incestuous marriage and threatens a mighty vengeance upon the
instigator of her crime
In the historian we find that the admonitions of Hamlet awakened the
conscience of the queen and recalled her to penitence and virtue The
king observing the change became doubly suspicious of the prince and
baffling some preliminary steps he took to vengeance Hamlet was
entrapped by him into an embassy to England He sent along with him two
courtiers who bore private letters to the English monarch requesting
him as the greatest favour he could confer on Denmark to compass by
secret and by sure means the death of the prince as soon as he landed
Hamlet during the voyage had reason to suspect the mission of his
companions and by a stratagem obtaining their credentials he found the
treacherous mandate and changing it for one wherein he ordered the
execution of the two lords he quietly proceeded with them to the
British shore On landing the papers were delivered and the king
without further parley obeyed what he believed to be the request of his
royal ally and thus did treason meet the punishment due to its crime
The daughter of the king being charmed with the person and manners of
the foreign prince evinced such marks of tenderness that Hamlet could
not but perceive the depth of his conquest He was not insensible to her
attractions and receiving the kings assent in the course of a few
days led her to the nuptial altar Amidst all joys he was however
like a perturbed ghost that could not rest and before many suns had
rose and set he obtained a hard wrung leave from his bride once more
set sail and appeared at Elsineur just in time to be a witness of the
splendid rites which Fengo supposing him now to be murdered had
prepared for his funeral On the proclamation of his arrival he was
welcomed with enthusiasm by the people whose idol he was and who had
been overwhelmed with grief when Fengo announced to them his sudden
death in England The king inflamed with so ruinous a disappointment
and becoming doubly jealous of his growing popularity now affected no
conciliation but openly manifested his hatred and hostility Hamlet
again had recourse to his pretended madness and committed so many
alarming acts that Fengo fearing their direction ordered his sword to
be locked in its scabbard under a plea of guarding the lunatic from
personal harm After various adventures at last the prince accomplished
the death of his uncles adherents and vengeance on the fratricide
himself by setting fire to the palace during the debauch of a midnight
banquet Rushing amidst the flames he kills Fengo with his own hand
reproaching him at the moment with his murder adultery and incest
Immediately on this act of retribution he was proclaimed lawful
successor to the throne and crowned with all due solemnity
Thus far Shakspeare treads in the steps of the annalist the only
difference is in the fate of the hero in the one he finds a kingdom in
the other a grave Saxo Grammaticus carries the history further and
after the crowning of Hamlet as king brings him again into Britain
where in compliment to that land of beauty he marries a second wife
the daughter of a Scottish king Hamlet brought both his wives to
Denmark and prepared for a long life of prosperity and peace But the
sword hung over his head war burst around him and he fell in combat by
the hand of Vigelotes son of Ruric Saxo Grammaticus sums up his
character in a few words He was a wise prince and a great warrior
Like Achilles he had the principal actions of his life wrought on his
shield The daughter of the king of Scotland casting her eye on it
loved him for the battles he had won and became his bride
SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS
ENGLISH FRUITS
Concluded from page 295
The VineThe value and transcendant excellence of this foreign fruit
is too well known to require any extended account in this paper as a
native of the southern verge of the northern temperate zone it only
requires its natural degree of heat to bring it to perfection The
growth is luxuriant is fertile easy of management and as it requires
support obedient to the trainers will Many excellent varieties ate in
our stoves and vineries differing in hardness size of bunches and in
colour and flavour of fruit These it is likely have been gained from
seeds and as its cultivation has been primval with the inhabitants of
the earth no wonder it received for its unequalled utility their
chiefest care
That the climate of this country has undergone a considerable change
within the last hundred years is allowed by all who have considered the
subject and nothing furnishes a more convincing proof of this than the
history of the vine Previous to the reign of Henry VIII every abbey
and monastery had its vineyard In the rentrolls of church property in
those days and long afterwards considerable quantities of grapes were
paid as tithe and the vestiges of some of those vineyards remain to
this day They were usually placed on the south side of a hill in a
light dry soil having the surface covered with sand the vines being
trained near the ground But with such inclement and changeable springs
and long protracted winters as have been experienced of late even such
frost as is seen at this moment 24th of April vines as standards in
the open air would be destroyed or at least no dependence could be
placed upon them for a crop But vineyards in the country could neither
be so profitable nor are they so necessary as they were in those days
international intercourse is now more open and corporations whether
religious or civil can be supplied with grapes in any shape and their
precious juice in any quantity at a cheaper rate than either homegrown
or homemade In their cultivation in this country practitioners are
more liable to err in planting them in too rich than in too poor a
soil the first adds too much to their natural luxuriance of growth and
always reduces the flavour of the fruit
The MulberryThis fruit has not been subjected to the
operations and attention of the improver so much perhaps as it
deserves true it has been planted against walls and as espaliers and
in both places has done well
The Fig has been long in our gardens a very ancient one is still
alive in the garden of one of the colleges at Oxford In its native
country it produces two crops in the year and this property makes its
management rather difficult in a country where it can but with
difficulty be made to produce one and especially when trained in the
common way to a wall where the crop is often sacrificed to the useless
symmetry of the tree It is impatient of frost and requires protection
during winter and is also impatient of the knife and more perhaps
than any other tree is disposed to form its own natural head When kept
in a glass case either planted in the ground or in pots it well repays
the trouble bestowed upon it
The QuinceThis fruit remains very steadily in character to
what it has always been known to be the taste is too austere to be used
alone from the tree but with other fruits in pastry or in the shape of
preserves or marmalade it is useful
The MedleyTwo or three sorts of this tree are in cultivation
they are placed in the lowest grade of fruits though when they are
perfectly mature they are much relished by some palates The azarola
service and two or three others used in the south of Europe are not
worth notice here
The FilbertThe common wild hazle of our hedges has been
improved by chance or cultivation into the several varieties of red
and white filberts and cobnuts Working them upon the hazle or upon
themselves is necessary because it not only makes them more fruitful
but also brings them sooner into bearing
The WalnutThis nuciferous tree has been cultivated in England
more for the value of the timber than for its fruit There are several
varieties differing chiefly in the size of the nut from the diminutive
bennut to the large or double French sort The only improvement which
can be expected in this is a hardier sort which would be less
susceptible of damage from frost
The ChestnutThe description of the walnut may be applied to
this as they are natives of the same climate and their flowers are
alike impatient of frost The fruit of this is however inferior to
that of the walnut and seldom arrives at the same degree of perfection
The tree grows to a great size and is one of the most valuable of our
forest trees In days of yore it must have been much more plentiful
in this country or more plentifully imported than it now is as the
principal timbers of abbeys cathedrals and other ancient buildings
are chiefly formed of it being equally durable as the oak which it so
much resembles that they can hardly be distinguished from each other
but by the test of the wet edge of a chissel being stained by the oak
and not at all by the chestnut
The Melon and CucumberThese exotic fruits are extensively
cultivated the latter takes various shapes in our bills of fare the
former is more a luxury than a fruit for general use their culture on
hotbeds forms a material branch of modern gardening and with that of
the gourd pumpkin squash vegetable marrow c is well known
The PineAppleThis sovereign of fruits is and can only be in
this country an appendage to opulence and rank Several varieties are
cultivated in our forcingstoves and grace the tables of the rich and
in as great perfection as they can be had between the tropics In their
wild state they affect the sides of rivulets and often under the shade
of lofty trees but are of inferior flavour unless the weather is very
dry when they are ripening off and when cultivated they receive little
or no water during the last stage of their growthQuarterly Journal

ANECDOTES OF THE MARVELLOUS
A Prediction Fulfilled
At the time of the American war a gentleman a mere youth entered the
army and saw some little service One day during an engagement he
was in the hurry and confusion of it knocked down and a soldier
setting his foot upon his chest in passing over him hurt him so
exceedingly that he became senseless upon recovering he found himself
still stretched on the ground and a singular looking female stood
beside him who as he opened his eyes exclaimed in an illboding
voice Ay young man mark my words that hurt will be the
death of you in your fortysecond year He immediately recognised in
this old raven one of those soothsayers who usually followed the
army and gained a livelihood by their oracular powers Mr L certainly
did mark her words inasmuch as returning to England he quitted
the army entered the church and amongst other redcoat reminiscences
used frequently to mention and mention but to ridicule the American
soothsayers prediction Nevertheless true it is that he did die in
his fortysecond year and of a disease in his chest too
although he had never suffered from the hurt beyond the period at which
he received it
Imagination
The measles it is pretty well known to all voyagers is at St Helena a
hideous and fatal disorder although generally mild at the Cape which
is about a fortnights sail from the former island every ship
therefore from the Cape upon touching at St Helena undergoes
examination and if the measles are known to be prevalent at the former
place is put into quarantine and no officer however urgent his
business may be allowed to land without making oath or affidavit that
he has not been on shore at the Cape or approached an infected person
Some years since a naval officer acquainted with the then governor of
St Helena General Pn was invited to dine with him and met at
dinner another officer from another vessel who it is to be presumed
had eluded undergoing the usual precautionary measures and was perhaps
ignorant of their existence since he mentioned during the repast that
the measles were prevailing at Cape Town and admitted that he had
entered it Now he had just arrived at St Helena and though he
expressly stated that he had not gone near any infected person poor
Mrs P uttering a shriek fled from the table exclaiming that she
knew she should have the measles in fact she immediately fell sick of
that disorder and died I think I understood All her family took it
and it raged through the island proving dreadfully destructive
Mysterious Incident
It was the wedding day of Mr and Mrs Terry I mean the actual
not the anniversary weddingday and the jocund bridegroom bride and
their guests were assembled about noon in the drawingroom when a
servant entered and said a gentleman had called and wished to speak to
Mr T that he was waiting below stairs and would not come up because
he came upon very particular business Mr Terry desiring his company
to excuse him for a few minutes quitted the room One hour elapsedno
bridegroom two hourshe did not appearthreefourhe was not
returned the brides mind misgave her and the hymeneal guests were
quite alarmed the servants declared that they had seen their master and
the gentleman walk into the garden from whence they were not returned
Now a high brick wall in which there was no outlet and over which no
person could climb except by a ladder enclosed the garden which when
searched was empty whilst at the same time Mr Terry and his
friend the gentleman could not have walked out at the
halldoor without being from its situation seen and heard by the
servants in the kitchen Time fledand he did not returnnoand
although his lady lived to be nearly ninety years of age she
never gained tidings again of the spouse thus so mysteriously
spirited away
Raising the Wind
The superstitions of sailors are not few as those assert who are
conversant in maritime affairs Amongst others is the custom pretty
well known of whistling for a wind A gentleman told me that on his
first voyage being then very young and ignorant of sea usages he was
in the habit of walking the deck a great deal and whistling as he
went perhaps for want of thoughtperhaps for lack of something
better to do Shortly he fancied that the captain of the vessel seemed
not a little annoyed whenever this took place although he kept a
respectful silence upon the subject At length Mr  resolved to
speak to him himself and accordingly one day when it blew a pretty
brisk gale said I observe captain that you appear particularly
uneasy whenever I whistleTo say the truth sir I am just now
replied he On a fair still day whistle as much as you please but
when there is a wind like this we dont like to have any more

A PHILOSOPHICAL KITCHEN
A romantic and ludicrous novel has just appeared entitled The Mummy
or Tale of the Twentysecond Century exhibiting some of the probable
results of the march of intellect and of the pungency of its satire
the following is a fair specimen describing a kitchen in the
twentysecond century
When Dr Entwerfen left the breakfastroom of Lord Gustavus which he
did not do till a considerable time after the rest of the party had
quitted it he was so absorbed in meditation that he did not know
exactly which way he was going and happening unfortunately to turn to
the right when he should have gone to the left to his infinite surprise
he found himself in the kitchen instead of his own study Absent as the
doctor was however his attention was soon roused by the scene before
him Being like many of his learned brotherhood somewhat of a
gourmand his indignation was violently excited by finding the cook
comfortably asleep on a sofa on one side of the room whilst the meat
intended for dinner a meal it was then the fashion to take about noon
was as comfortably resting itself from its toils on the other The
chemical substitute for fire which ought to have cooked it having gone
out and the cooks nap precluding all reasonable expectation of its
reillumination the doctors wrath was kindled though the fire was
not and in a violent rage he seized the gentle Celestinas shoulder
and and shook her till she woke Where am I exclaimed she opening
her eyes Any where but where you ought to be cried the doctor in a
fury Look hussy look at that fine joint of meat lying quite cold
and sodden in its own steam Dear me returned Celestina yawning
I am really quite unfortunate today An unlucky accident has already
occurred to a leg of mutton which was to have formed part of todays
aliments and now this piece of beef is also destroyed I am afraid
there will be nothing for dinner but some mucilaginous saccharine
vegetables and they most probably will be boiled to a viscous
consistency And what excuse can you offer for all this exclaimed
the doctor his voice trembling with passion It was unavoidable
replied Celestina coolly whilst I was copying a cast from the Apollo
Belvidere this morning having unguardedly applied too much caloric to
the vessel containing the leg of mutton the aqueous fluid in which it
was immersed evaporated and the viand became completely calcinated
Whilst the other affair Hush hush interrupted the doctor I
cannot bear to hear you mention it Oh surely Job himself never
suffered such a trial of his patience In fact his troubles were
scarcely worth mentioning for he was never cursed with learned
servants Saying this the doctor retired lamenting his hard fate in
not having been born in those halcyon days when cooks drew nothing but
their poultry whilst the gentle Celestinas breast panted with
indignation at his complaint An opportunity soon offered for revenge
and seeing the doctors steam valet ready to be carried to its masters
chamber she treacherously applied a double portion of caloric in
consequence of which the machine burst whilst in the act of brushing
the doctors coat collar and by discharging the whole of the scalding
water contained in its cauldron upon him reduced him to a melancholy
state

THE FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH ERECTED IN ENGLAND
For the Mirror
The venerable and interesting church of St Martin is situated on the
side of a hill named from it at the distance of little more than a
quarter of a mile from the dilapidated walls of Canterbury It is
generally believed to have been erected by the Christian soldiers in the
Roman army about the time of king Lucius AD 182 and hence is justly
esteemed as the first Christian church erected in Britain and
indeed nothing appears to contradict this assertion for the Britons
before the arrival of the Romans were as is well known in a state of
barbarism and idolatry and their habitations huts of clay and turf and
as to its being built after their departure I do not think it at all
likely for England was then ravaged and overrun by the warlike clans of
its mountain neighbours and consequently its inhabitants had not time
or inclination to erect buildings when their lives and property were
daily in danger Their successors the early Saxons too I think
cannot claim any pretensions to St Martin they being heathens and
unacquainted with the Christian religion Nor could they entirely
ignorant of Roman materials have built an edifice completely composed
with them
Here then was a Christian church and a Christian congregation
established in Britain full 415 years before Augustins arrival but as
St Martin bishop of Tours died in the year 395 this church could not
have been erected in his honour but it might afterwards have been
dedicated to him by Luidhard chaplain to Bertha wife of Ethelbert the
Kentish king and this is the more likely as Luidhard himself was a
French bishop
In conclusion it may not be unnecessary to state that though the
papists consider Augustin as the apostle of the English they do not
acknowledge him as their first instructor in Christianity for as it
appears in their service for May 26 Lucius a British king wrote to
St Eleutherius who was elected priest AD 177 desiring that he
might be numbered among the Christians By whom or by what means this
conversion was effected does not appear but however in reply to it
Eleutherius sent the monks Damian and Fryatius into Britain from whom
the king and many of his subjects received the gospel
