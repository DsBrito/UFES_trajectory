that the writer was born in a New England home and bred in an
antislavery atmosphere where the political creed of Douglas could not
thrive If this book reveals a somewhat less sectional outlook than
this personal allusion suggests the credit must be given to those
generous friends in the great Middle West who have helped the writer
to interpret the spirit of that region which gave both Douglas and
Lincoln to the nation
The material for this study has been brought together from many
sources Through the kindness of Mrs James W Patton of Springfield
Illinois I have had access to a valuable collection of letters
written by Douglas to her father Charles H Lanphier Esq editor of
the Illinois State Register Judge Robert M Douglas of North
Carolina has permitted me to use an autobiographical sketch of his
father as well as other papers in the possession of the family Among
those who have lightened my labors either by copies of letters penned
by Douglas or by personal recollections I would mention with
particular gratitude the late Mrs LK Lippincott Grace
Greenwood Mr JH Roberts and Stephen A Douglas Esq of Chicago
Chief Justice Melville W Fuller and the late Hon Robert E Hitt of
Washington With his wonted generosity Mr James F Rhodes has given
me the benefit of his wide acquaintance with the newspapers of the
period which have been an invaluable aid in the interpretation of
Douglass career Finally by personal acquaintance and conversation
with men who knew him I have endeavored to catch the spirit of those
who made up the great mass of his constituents

THE CALL OF THE WEST
CHAPTER I
FROM THE GREEN MOUNTAINS TO THE PRAIRIES
The dramatic moments in the colonizing of coastal New England have
passed into song story and sober chronicle but the farther
migration of the English people from tidewater to interior has been
too prosaic a theme for poets and too diverse a movement for
historians Yet when all the factors in our national history shall be
given their full value none will seem more potent than the great
racial drift from the New England frontier into the heart of the
continent The New Englanders who formed a broad belt from Vermont and
New York across the Northwest to Kansas were a social and political
force of incalculable power in the era which ended with the Civil
War The New Englander of the Middle West however ceased to be
altogether a Yankee The lake and prairie plains bred a spirit which
contrasted strongly with the smug provincialism of rockribbed and
sterile New England The exultation born of wide unbroken horizon
lines and broad teeming prairie landscapes found expression in the
oftenquoted saying Vermont is the most glorious spot on the face of
this globe for a man to be born in provided he emigrates when he is
very young The career of Stephen Arnold Douglas is intelligible only
as it is viewed against the background of a New England boyhood a
young manhood passed on the prairies of Illinois and a wedded life
pervaded by the gentle culture of Southern womanhood
In America observed De Tocqueville two generations ago democracy
disposes every man to forget his ancestors When the Hon Stephen A
Douglas was once asked to prepare an account of his career for a
biographical history of Congress he chose to omit all but the barest
reference to his forefathers1 Possibly he preferred to leave the
family tree naked that his unaided rise to eminence might the more
impress the chance reader Yet the records of the Douglass family are
not uninteresting2 The first of the name to cross the ocean was
William Douglass who was born in Scotland and who wedded Mary Ann
daughter of Thomas Marble of Northampton Just when this couple left
Old England is not known but the birth of a son is recorded in
Boston in the year 1645 Soon after this event they removed to New
London preferring it would seem to try their luck in an outlying
settlement for this region was part of the Pequot country Somewhat
more than a hundred years later Benajah Douglass a descendant of
this pair and grandfather of the subject of this sketch pushed still
farther into the interior and settled in Rensselaer County in the
province of New York The marriage of Benajah Douglass to Martha
Arnold a descendant of Governor William Arnold of Rhode Island has
an interest for those who are disposed to find Celtic qualities in the
grandson for the Arnolds were of Welsh stock and may be supposed to
have revived the strain in the Douglass blood
Tradition has made Benajah Douglass a soldier in the war of the
Revolution but authentic records go no farther back than the year
1795 when he removed with his family to Brandon Vermont There he
purchased a farm of about four hundred acres which he must have
cultivated with some degree of skill since it seems to have yielded
an ample competency He is described as a man of genial buoyant
disposition with much selfconfidence He was five times chosen
selectman of Brandon and five times he was elected to represent the
town in the General Assembly The physical qualities of the grandson
may well have been a family inheritance since of Benajah we read that
he was of medium height with large head and body short neck and
short limbs3
The portrait of Benajahs son is far less distinct He was a graduate
of Middlebury College and a physician by profession He married Sally
Fisk the daughter of a welltodo farmer in Brandon by whom he had
two children the younger of whom was Stephen Arnold Douglass born
April 23 1813 The promising career of the young doctor was cut short
by a sudden stroke which overtook him as he held his infant son in
his arms The plain little oneandahalf story house in which the
boy first saw the light suggests that the young physician had been
unable to provide for more than the bare necessities of his family4
Soon after the death of Dr Douglass his widow removed to the farm
which she and her unmarried brother had inherited from her father The
children grew to love this bachelor uncle with almost filial
affection Too young to take thought for the morrow they led the
wholesome natural life of country children Stephen went to the
district school on the Brandon turnpike and had no reason to bemoan
the fate which left him largely dependent upon his uncles generosity
An old schoolmate recalls young Douglass through the haze of years
as a robust healthy boy with generous instincts though tenacious of
his rights5 After school hours work and play alternated The
regular farm chores were not the least part in the youngsters
education he learned to be industrious and not to despise honest
labor6
This bare outline of a commonplace boyhood must be filled in with many
details drawn from environment Stephen fell heir to a wealth of
inspiring local traditions The fresh mountain breezes had also once
blown full upon the anxious faces of heroes and patriots the quiet
valleys had once echoed with the noise of battle this land of the
Green Mountains was the Wilderness of colonial days the frontier for
restless New Englanders where with good axe and stout heart they had
carved their home plots out of the virgin forest Many a legend of
adventure of border warfare and of personal heroism was still
current among the Green Mountain folk Where was the Vermont lad who
did not fight over again the battles of Bennington Ticonderoga and
Plattsburg
Other influences were scarcely less formative in the life of the
growing boy Vermont was also the land of the town meeting Whatever
may be said of the efficiency of town government it was and is a
school of democracy In Vermont it was the natural political
expression of social forces How else indeed could the general will
find fit expression except through the attrition of many minds And
who could know better the needs of the community than the commonalty
Not that men reasoned about the philosophy of their political
institutions they simply accepted them And young Douglass grew up in
an atmosphere friendly to local selfgovernment of an extreme type
Stephen was nearing his fourteenth birthday when an event occurred
which interrupted the even current of his life His uncle who was
commonly regarded as a confirmed old bachelor confounded the village
gossips by bringing home a young bride The birth of a son and heir
was the nephews undoing While the uncle regarded Stephen with
undiminished affection he was now much more emphatically in loco
parentis An indefinable something had come between them The subtle
change in relationship was brought home to both when Stephen proposed
that he should go to the academy in Brandon to prepare for college
That he was to go to college he seems to have taken for granted
There was a moment of embarrassment and then the uncle told the lad
frankly but kindly that he could not provide for his further
education With considerable show of affection he advised him to give
up the notion of going to college and to remain on the farm where he
would have an assured competence In after years the grown man related
this incident with a tinge of bitterness averring that there had been
an understanding in the family that he was to attend college7
Momentary disappointment he may have felt to be sure but he could
hardly have been led to believe that he could draw indefinitely upon
his uncles bounty
Piqued and somewhat resentful Stephen made up his mind to live no
longer under his uncles roof He would show his spirit by proving
that he was abundantly able to take care of himself Much against the
wishes of his mother who knew him to be mastered by a boyish whim he
apprenticed himself to Nahum Parker a cabinetmaker in Middlebury8
He put on his apron went to work sawing table legs from twoinch
planks and delighted with the novelty of the occupation and
exhilarated by his newly found sense of freedom believed himself on
the highway to happiness and prosperity He found plenty of companions
with whom he spent his idle hours young fellows who had a taste for
politics and who rapidly kindled in the newcomer a consuming
admiration for Andrew Jackson He now began to read with avidity such
political works as came to hand Discussion with his new friends and
with his employer who was an ardent supporter of Adams and Clay
whetted his appetite for more reading and study In after years he was
wont to say that these were the happiest days of his life9
Toward the end of the year he became dissatisfied with his employer
because he was forced to perform some menial services in the
house10 He wished his employer to know that he was not a household
servant but an apprentice Further difficulties arose which
terminated his apprenticeship in Middlebury Returning to Brandon he
entered the shop of Deacon Caleb Knowlton also a cabinetmaker but
in less than a year he quit this employer on the plea of
illhealth11 It is quite likely that the confinement and severe
manual labor may have overtaxed the strength of the growing boy but
it is equally clear that he had lost his taste for cabinet work He
never again expressed a wish to follow a trade He again took up his
abode with his mother and the means now coming to hand from some
source he enrolled as a student in Brandon Academy with the avowed
purpose of preparing for a professional career12 It was a wise
choice Vermont may have lost a skilled handworkerthere are those
who vouch for the excellence of his handiwork13but the Union
gained a joiner of firstrate ability
Wedding bells rang in another change in his fortunes The marriage of
his sister to a young New Yorker from Ontario County was followed by
the marriage of his mother to the father Gehazi Granger Both couples
took up their residence on the Granger estate and thither also went
Stephen with perhaps a sense of loneliness in his boyish heart14
He was then but seventeen This removal to New York State proved to be
his first step along a path which Vermonters were wearing toward the
West
Happily his academic course was not long interrupted by this
migration for Canandaigua Academy which offered unusual advantages
was within easy reach from his new home Under the wise instruction of
Professor Henry Howe he began the study of Latin and Greek and by
his own account made considerable improvement though there is
little evidence in his later life of any acquaintance with the
classics He took an active part in the doings of the literary
societies of the academy distinguishing himself by his readiness in
debate His Democratic proclivities were still strong and he became
an ardent defender of Democracy against the rising tide of
AntiMasonry which was threatening to sweep New York from its
political moorings Tradition says that young Douglass mingled much
with local politicians learning not a little about the arts and
devices by which the Albany Regency controlled the Democratic
organization in the State In this school of practical politics he was
beyond a peradventure an apt pupil
A characteristic story is told of Douglass during these school days at
Canandaigua15 A youngster who occupied a particularly desirable
seat at table had been ousted by another lad who claimed a better
right to the place Some one suggested that the claimants should have
the case argued by counsel before a board of arbitration The
dispossessed boy lost his case because of the superior skill with
which Douglass presented the claims of his client It was the first
assertion of the doctrine of squatter sovereignty said the defeated
claimant recalling the incident years afterward when both he and
Douglas were in politics
Douglass was now maturing rapidly His ideals were clearer his native
tastes more pronounced It is not improbable that already he looked
forward to politics as a career At all events he took the proximate
step toward that goal by beginning the study of law in the office of
local attorneys at the same time continuing his studies begun in the
academy What marked him off from his comrades even at this period was
his lively acquisitiveness He seemed to learn quite as much by
indirection as by persevering application to books16
In the spring of 1833 the same unrest that sent the first Douglass
across the sea to the new world seized the young man Against the
remonstrances of his mother and his relatives he started for the
great West which then spelled opportunity to so many young men He was
only twenty years old and he had not yet finished his academic
course but with the impatience of ambition he was reluctant to spend
four more years in study before he could gain admission to the bar In
the newer States of the West conditions were easier Moreover he was
no longer willing to be a burden to his mother whose resources were
limited And so with purposes only half formed and with only enough
money for his immediate needs he began not so much a journey as a
drift in a westerly direction for he had no particular destination in
view17
After a short stay in Buffalo and a visit to Niagara Falls and the
battle ground of Chippewa the boy took a steamboat to Cleveland
where happily he found a friend in Sherlock J Andrews Esquire a
successful attorney and a man of kindly impulses Finding the city
attractive and the requirements for the Ohio bar less rigorous
Douglass determined to drop anchor in this pleasant port Mr Andrews
encouraged him in this purpose offering the use of his office and
law library In a single year Douglass hoped to gain admission to the
bar With characteristic energy he began his studies Fate ruled
however that his career should not be linked with the Western
Reserve Within a few days he was prostrated by that foe which then
lurked in the marshes and lowlands of the Westfoe more dreaded than
the redmanmalarial typhoid For four weary months he kept his bed
hovering between life and death until the heat of summer was spent
and the first frosts of October came to revive him Urgent appeals now
came to him to return home but pride kept him from yielding After
paying all his bills he still had forty dollars left He resolved to
push on farther into the interior18
He was far from well when he took the canal boat from Cleveland to
Portsmouth on the Ohio river but he was now in a reckless and
adventurous mood He would test his luck by pressing on to Cincinnati
He had no welldefined purpose he was in a listless mood which was
no doubt partly the result of physical exhaustion From Cincinnati he
drifted on to Louisville and then to St Louis His small funds were
now almost all spent He must soon find occupation or starve His
first endeavor was to find a law office where he could earn enough by
copying and other work to pay his expenses while he continued his law
studies No such opening fell in his way and he had no letters of
introduction here to smooth his path He was now convinced that he
must seek some small country town Hearing that Jacksonville
Illinois was a thriving settlement he resolved to try his luck in
this quarter With much the same desperation with which a gambler
plays his last stake he took passage on a river boat up the Illinois
and set foot upon the soil of the great prairie State19
A primitive stage coach plied between the river and Jacksonville Too
fatigued to walk the intervening distance Douglass mounted the
lumbering vehicle and ruefully paid his fare From this point of
vantage he took in the prairie landscape Morgan County was then but
sparsely populated Timber fringed the creeks and the river bottoms
while the prairie grass grew rank over soil of unsuspected fertility
Most dwellings were rude structures made of roughhewn logs and
designed as makeshifts Wildcats and wolves prowled through the timber
lands in winter and game of all sorts abounded20 As the stage
swung lazily along the lad had ample time to let the first impression
of the prairie landscape sink deep In the timber the trees were
festooned with bittersweet and with vines bearing wild grapes in the
open country nothing but unmeasured stretches of waving grass caught
the eye21 To one born and bred among the hills this broad horizon
and unbroken landscape must have been a revelation Weak as he was
Douglass drew in the fresh autumnal air with zest and unconsciously
borrowed from the face of nature a sense of unbounded capacity Years
afterward when he was famous he testified I found my mind
liberalized and my opinions enlarged when I got on these broad
prairies with only the heavens to bound my vision instead of having
them circumscribed by the little ridges that surrounded the valley
where I was born22 But of all this he was unconscious when he
alighted from the stage in Jacksonville He was simply a wayworn lad
without a friend in the town and with only one dollar and twentyfive
cents in his pocket23
Jacksonville was then hardly more than a crowded village of log cabins
on the outposts of civilized Illinois24 Comfort was not among the
first concerns of those who had come to subdue the wilderness Comfort
implied leisure to enjoy and leisure was like Heavento be attained
only after a wearisome earthly pilgrimage Jacksonville had been
scourged by the cholera during the summer and those who had escaped
the disease had fled the town for fear of it25 By this time
however the epidemic had spent itself and the refugees had returned
All told the town had a population of about one thousand souls among
whom were no less than eleven lawyers or at least those who called
themselves such26
A days lodging at the Tavern ate up the remainder of the wanderers
funds so that he was forced to sell a few school books that he had
brought with him Meanwhile he left no stone unturned to find
employment to his liking One of his first acquaintances was Murray
McConnell a lawyer who advised him to go to Pekin farther up the
Illinois River and open a law office The young man replied that he
had no license to practice law and no law books He was assured that
a license was a matter of no consequence since anyone could practice
before a justice of the peace and he could procure one at his
leisure As for books McConnell with true Western generosity
offered to loan such as would be of immediate use So again Douglass
took up his travels At Meredosia the nearest landing on the river
he waited a week for the boat upstream There was no other available
route to Pekin Then came the exasperating intelligence that the only
boat which plied between these points had blown up at Alton After
settling accounts with the tavernkeeper he found that he had but
fifty cents left27
There was now but one thing to do since hard manual labor was out of
the question he would teach school But where Meredosia was a
forlorn thriftless place and he had no money to travel Fortunately
a kindhearted farmer befriended him lodging him at his house over
night and taking him next morning to Exeter where there was a
prospect of securing a school Disappointment again awaited him but
Winchester ten miles away was said to need a teacher Taking his
coat on his armhe had left his trunk at Meredosiahe set off on
foot for Winchester28
Accident happily turned to his profit served to introduce him to the
townspeople of Winchester The morning after his arrival he found a
crowd in the public square and learned that an auction sale of
personal effects was about to take place Everyone from the
administrator of the estate to the village idler was eager for the
sale to begin But a clerk to keep record of the sales and to draw the
notes was wanting The eye of the administrator fell upon Douglass
something in the youths appearance gave assurance that he could
cipher The impatient bystanders lowed that he might do so he
was given a trial Douglass proved fully equal to the task and in two
days was in possession of five dollars for his pains29
Through the good will of the village storekeeper who also hailed from
Vermont Douglass was presented to several citizens who wished to see
a school opened in town and by the first Monday in December he had a
subscription list of forty scholars each of whom paid three dollars
for three months tuition30 Luck was now coming his way He found
lodgings under the roof of this same friendly compatriot the village
storekeeper who gave him the use of a small room adjoining the
storeroom31 Here Douglass spent his evenings devoting some hours
to his law books and perhaps more to comfortable chats with his host
and talkative neighbors around the stove For diversion he had the
weekly meetings of the Lyceum which had just been formed32 He owed
much to this institution for the the debates and discussions gave him
a chance to convert the traditional leadership which fell to him as
village schoolmaster into a real leadership of talent and ready wit
In this Lyceum he made his first political speech defending Andrew
Jackson and his attack upon the Bank against Josiah Lamborn a lawyer
from Jacksonville33 For a young man he proved himself astonishingly
wellinformed If the chronology of his autobiography may be accepted
he had already read the debates in the Constitutional Convention of
1787 the Federalist the works of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson
and the recent debates in Congress
Even while he was teaching school Douglass found time to practice law
in a modest way before the justices of the peace and when the first
of March came he closed the schoolhouse door on his career as
pedagogue He at once repaired to Jacksonville and presented himself
before a justice of the Supreme Court for license to practice law
After a short examination which could not have been very searching
he was duly admitted to the bar of Illinois He still lacked a month
of being twentyone years of age34 Measured by the standard of
older communities in the East he knew little law but there were few
cases in these Western courts which required much more than
commonsense ready speech and acquaintance with legal procedure
Stare decisis was a maxim that did not trouble the average lawyer
for there were few decisions to stand upon35 Besides experience
would make good any deficiencies of preparation

CHAPTER II
THE RISE OF THE POLITICIAN
The young attorney who opened a law office in the Court House at
Jacksonville bore little resemblance to the forlorn lad who had
vainly sought a livelihood there some months earlier The winter winds
of the prairies so far from racking the frame of the convalescent
had braced and toned his whole system When spring came he was in the
best of health and full of animal spirits He entered upon his new
life with zest Here was a people after his own heart a generous
wholesome optimistic folk He opened his heart to them and of
course hospitable doors opened to him He took society as he found
it rude perhaps but genuine With plenty of leisure at command he
mingled freely with young people of his own age he joined the
boisterous young fellows in their village sports he danced with the
maidens and he did not forget to cultivate the good graces of their
elders Mothers liked his animation and ready gallantry fathers found
him equally responsive on more serious matters of conversation
Altogether he was a very general favorite in a not too fastidious
society36
Nor was the circle of the young attorneys acquaintances limited to
Jacksonville As the county seat and most important town in Morgan
County Jacksonville was a sort of rural emporium Thither came
farmers from the country round about to market their produce and to
purchase their supplies The town had an unwontedly busy aspect on
Saturdays This was the day which drew women to town While they did
their shopping the men loitered on street corners or around the
