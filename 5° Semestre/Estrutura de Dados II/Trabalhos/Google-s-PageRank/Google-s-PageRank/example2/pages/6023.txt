Eastthorpe was a malting town and down by the water were two or three
large malthouses  The view from the bridge was not particularly
picturesque but it was pleasant especially in summer when the wind was
southwest  The malthouses and their cowls the wharves and the gaily
painted sailing barges alongside the fringe of slanting willows turning
the silvergray sides of their foliage towards the breeze the island in
the middle of the river with bigger willows the large expanse of sky
the soft clouds distinct in form almost to the far distant horizon and
looking eastwards the illimitable distance towards the fens and the
seaall this made up a landscape more suitable perhaps to some persons
than rock or waterfall although no picture had ever been painted of it
and nobody had ever come to see it
Such was Eastthorpe  For hundreds of years had the shadow of St Marys
swept slowly over the roofs underneath it and of all those years
scarcely a line of its history survived save what was written in the
churchyard or in the church registers  The town had stood for the
Parliament in the days of the Civil War and there had been a skirmish in
the place but who fought in it who were killed in it and what the
result was nobody knew  Half a dozen old skulls of much earlier date
and of great size were once found in a gravel pit two miles away and
were the subject of much talk some taking them for Romans some for
Britons some for Saxons and some for Danes  As it was impossible to be
sure if they were Christian they could not be put in consecrated ground
they were therefore included in an auction of dead and live stock and
were bought by the doctor  Surnames survived in Eastthorpe with singular
pertinacity for it was remote from the world but what was the
relationship between the scores of Thaxtons for example whose deaths
were inscribed on the tombstones some of them all awry and weatherworn
and the Thaxtons of 1840 no living Thaxton could tell every spiritual
trace of them having disappeared more utterly than their bones  Their
bones indeed did not disappear and were a source of much trouble to
the sexton for in digging a new grave they came up to the surface in
quantities and had to be shovelled in and covered up again so that the
bodily remains of successive generations were jumbled together and
Puritan and Georgian Thaxtons were mixed promiscuously with their
descendants  Nevertheless Eastthorpe had really had a history  It had
known victory and defeat love hatred intrigue hope despair and all
the passions just as Elizabeth King Charles Cromwell and Queen Anne
knew them but they were not recorded
It was a bright hot August Saturday as we have said and it was market
day  Furthermore it was halfpast two in the afternoon and the guests
at Mr Furzes had just finished their dinner  Mr Furze was the largest
ironmonger in Eastthorpe and sold not only ironmongery but ploughs and
all kinds of agricultural implements  At the back of the shop was a
small foundry where all the foundry work for miles round Eastthorpe was
done  It was Mr Furzes practice always to keep a kind of open house on
Saturday and on this particular day at halfpast two Mr Bellamy Mr
Chandler Mr Gosford and Mr Furze were drinking their
whiskeyandwater and smoking their pipes in Mr Furzes parlour  The
first three were welltodo farmers and with them the whiskeyandwater
was not a pretence  Mr Furze was a tradesman and of a different build
Strong tobacco and whiskey at that hour and in that heat were rather too
much for him and he played with his pipe and drank very slowly  The
conversation had subsided for a while under the influence of the beef
Yorkshire pudding beer and spirits when Mr Bellamy observed
Old Bartletts widow still alivin up at the Croft
Yes said Mr Gosford after filling his pipe again and pausing for at
least a minute Bartletts dead
Bartlett wur a slowcoach observed Mr Chandler after another pause
of a minute so wur his mare  I mind me I wur behind his mare about
five years ago last Michaelmas and I wur wellnigh perished  I wur a
goin to give her a poke with my stick and old Bartlett says Doant
hit her doant hit her yer cant alter her
The three worthy farmers roared with laughter Mr Furze smiling gently
That was a good un said Mr Bellamy
Ah replied Chandler I mind that as well as if it wur yesterday
Mr Bellamy at this point had to leave and Mr Furze was obliged to
attend to his shop  Gosford and Chandler however remained and Gosford
continued the subject of Bartletts widow
Whats she astayin on for up there
Old Bartletts left her a goodish bit
She wur younger than he
A dead silence of some minutes
She aint agoin to take the Croft on herself observed Gosford
Them beasts of the squires replied Chandler fetched a goodish lot
Scaled just over ninety stone apiece
Why doant you go in for the widow Chandler
Mr Chandler was a widower
Eh with a nasal tone and a smilebit too much for me
Too much  Why there aint above fourteen stone of her  Keep yer warm
o nights up at your cold place
Mr Chandler took the pipe out of his mouth put it inside the fender
compressed his lips rubbed his chin and looked up to the ceiling
Well I must be agoin
I suppose I must too and they both went their ways to meet again at
teatime
At five punctually all had again assembled the additions to the party
being Mrs Furze and her daughter Catharine a young woman of nineteen
Mrs Furze was not an Eastthorpe lady she came from Cambridge and Mr
Furze had first seen her when she was on a visit in Eastthorpe  Her
father was a draper in Cambridge which was not only a much bigger place
than Eastthorpe but had a university and Mrs Furze talked about the
university familiarly so that although her education had been slender
a university flavour clung to her and the farmers round Eastthorpe would
have been quite unable to determine the difference between her and a
senior wrangler if they had known what a senior wrangler was
Ha observed Mr Gosford when they were seated I wur sayin Mrs
Furze to Chandler as he ought to go in for old Bartletts widow  Now
what do you think  Wouldnt they make a pretty pair and he twisted
Chandlers shoulders round a little till he faced Mrs Furze
Dont you be a fool Gosford said Chandler in good temper but as he
disengaged himself he upset his tea on Mrs Furzes carpet
Really Mr Gosford replied Mrs Furze with some dignity and
asperity I am no judge in such matters  They are best left to the
persons concerned
No offence maam no offence
Mrs Furze was not quite a favourite with her husbands friends and he
knew it but he was extremely anxious that their dislike to her should
not damage his business relationships with them  So he endeavoured to
act as mediator
No doubt my dear no doubt but at the same time there is no reason why
Mr Gosford should not make any suggestion which may be to our friend
Chandlers advantage
But Mr Gosford was checked and did not pursue the subject  Catharine
sat next to him
Mr Gosford when may I come to Moat Farm again
Lord my dear whenever you like you know that  Me and Mrs G is
always glad to see you  Whenever you please and Mr Gosford
instantly recovered the goodhumour which Mrs Furze had suppressed
Dont forget us chimed in Mr Bellamy  Well turn out your room and
store apples in it if you dont use it oftener
Now Mr Bellamy said Catharine holding up her finger at him youll
be sick of me at last  Youve forgotten when I had that bad cold at your
house and was in bed there for a week and what a bother I was to Mrs
Bellamy
Bother cried Bellamybother  Lord have mercy on us why the missus
was sayin when you talked about bother my missus says Id sooner have
Catharine here and me have tea up there with her notwithstanding there
must be a fire upstairs and Ive had to send Lucy to the infirmary with a
whitlow on her thumbyes I would than be at a many teaparties I
know
Mrs Furze gave elaborate teaparties and was uncomfortably uncertain
whether or not the shaft was intended for her
My dear Catharine I shall be delighted if you go either to Mr
Gosfords or to Mr Bellamys but you must consider your wardrobe a
little  You will remember that the last time on each occasion a dress
was torn in pieces
But mother are not dresses intended to keep thorns from our legs or
at any rate isnt that one reason why we wear them
Suppose it to be so my dear there is no reason why you should plunge
about in thorns
Catharine had a provoking way of saving yes or no when she wished to
terminate a controversy  She stated her own opinion and then if
objection was raised at least by some people her father and mother
included she professed agreement by a simple monosyllable either
because she was lazy or because she saw that there was no chance of
further profit in the discussion  It was irritating because it was
always clear she meant nothing  At this instant a servant opened the
door and Alice a curly brown retriever squeezed herself in and made
straight for Catharine putting her head on Catharines lap
Catharine Catharine cried her mother with a little scream shes
dripping wet  Do pray my child think of the carpet
But Catharine put her lips to Alices face and kissed it deliberately
giving her a piece of cake
Mr Gosford my poor bitch has puppiesthree of themall as true as
their mother for we know the father
Ah replied Gosford youre lucky then Miss Catharine for dogs
especially in a town
Mrs Furze at this moment hastily rang the bell making an unusual
clatter with the crockery Mr Furze said the company must excuse him
and the three worthy farmers rose to take their departure
CHAPTER II
It was Mr Furzes custom on Sunday to go to sleep for an hour between
dinner and tea upstairs in what was called the drawingroom while Mrs
Furze sat and read or said she read a religious book  On hot summer
afternoons Mr Furze always took off his coat before he had his nap and
sometimes divested himself of his waistcoat  When the coat and waistcoat
were taken off Mrs Furze invariably drew down the blinds  She had
often remonstrated with her husband for appearing in his shirtsleeves
and objected to the neighbours seeing him in this costume  There was a
sofa in the room but it was horsehair with high ends both alike not
comfortable which were covered with curious complications called
antimacassars that slipped off directly they were touched so that
anybody who leaned upon them was engaged continually in warfare with
them picking them up from the floor or spreading them out again  There
was also an easy chair but it was not easy for it matched the sofa in
horsehair and was so ingeniously contrived that directly a person
placed himself in it it gently shot him forwards  Furthermore it had
special antimacassars which were a work of art and Mrs Furze had
warned Mr Furze off them  He would ruin them she said if he put
his head upon them  So a windsor chair with a high back was always
carried by Mr Furze upstairs after dinner together with a common
kitchen chair and on these he slumbered  The room was never used save
on Sundays and when Mrs Furze gave a teaparty  It overlooked the
marketplace and although on a Sunday afternoon the High Street was
almost completely silent Mrs Furze liked to sit so near the window that
she could peep out at the edge of the blind when she was not dozing  It
is true no master nor mistress ever stirred at that hour but every now
and then a maidservant could be seen and she was better than nothing for
the purpose of criticism  A round table stood in the middle of the room
with a pink vase on it containing artificial flowers and on the
mantelpiece were two other pink vases and two great shells  Over the
mantelpiece was a portrait of His Majesty King George the Fourth in his
robes and exactly opposite was a picture of the Virgin Mary which was
old and valuable  Mr Furze bought it at a sale with some other things
and did not quite like it  It savoured of Popery which he could not
abide but the parson one day saw it and told Mrs Furze it was worth
something whereupon she put it in a new maple frame and had it hung in
a place of honour second to that occupied by King George and so arranged
that he and the Virgin were always looking at one another  On the other
side of the room were a likeness of Mr Eaton in hunting array with the
dogs and a mezzotint of the Deluge
Mr Furze had just awaked on the Sunday afternoon following the day of
which the history is partly given in the first chapter
My dear said his wife I have been thinking a good deal of Catharine
She is not quite what I could wish
No replied Mr Furze with a yawn
To begin with she uses bad language  I was really quite shocked
yesterday to hear the extremely vulgar word almostalmostI do not
know what to call itprofane I may say which she applied to her dog
when talking of it to Mr Gosford  Then she goes in the foundry and I
firmly believe that all the money which has been spent on her music is
utterly thrown away
The thing iswhat is to be done
Now I have a plan
In order to make Mrs Furzes plan fully intelligible it may be as well
to explain that up to the year 1840 the tradesmen of Eastthorpe had
lived at their shops  But a year or two before that date some houses had
been built at the north end of the town and called The Terrace  A new
doctor had taken one the brewer another and a third had been taken by
the grocer a man reputed to be very well off who not only did a large
retail business but supplied the small shops in the villages round
Well my dear what is your plan
Your connection is extending and you want more room  Now why should
you not move to the Terrace  If we were to go there Catharine would be
withdrawn from the society in which she at present mixes  You could not
continue to give market dinners and gradually her acquaintance with the
persons whom you now invite would cease  I believe too that if we were
in the Terrace Mrs Colston would call on us  As the wife of a brewer
she cannot do so now  Then there is just another thing which has been on
my mind for a long time  It is settled that Mr Jennings is to leave
for he has accepted an invitation from the cause at Ely  I do not think
we shall like anybody after Mr Jennings and it would be a good
opportunity for us to exchange the chapel for the church  We have
attended the chapel regularly but I have always felt a kind of prejudice
there against us or at least against myself and there is no denying
that the people who go to church are vastly more genteel and so are the
service and everything about itthe vespersthe bellssomehow there is
a respectability in it
Mr Furze was silent  At last he said It is a very serious matter  I
must consider it in all its bearings
It was a serious matter and he did consider itbut not in all its
bearings for he did nothing but think about it so that it enveloped
him and he could not put himself at such a distance that he could see
its real shape  He was now well over fifty and was the kind of person
with whom habits become firmly fixed  He was fixed even in his dress  He
always wore a white neckcloth and his shirt was frilledfashions which
were already beginning to die out in Eastthorpe  His manner of life was
most regular breakfast at eight dinner at one tea at five supper at
nine with a pipe afterwards was his unvarying round  He never left
Eastthorpe for a holiday and read no books of any kind  He was a most
respectable member of a Dissenting congregation but he was not a member
of the church and was never seen at the weeknight services or the
prayermeetings  He went through the ceremony of family worship morning
and evening but he did not pray extempore as did the elect and
contented himself with reading prayers from a book called Family
Devotions  The days were over for Eastthorpe when a man like Mr Furze
could be denounced a man who paid his pewrent regularly and
contributed to the missionary societies  The days were over when any
expostulations could be addressed to him or any attempts made to bring
him within the fold and Mr Jennings therefore called on him and
religion was not mentioned  It may seem extraordinary that without
convictions based on any reasoning process Mr Furzes outward existence
should have been so correct and so moral  He had passed through the
usually stormy period of youth without censure  It is true he was
married young but before his marriage nobody had ever heard a syllable
against him and after marriage he never drank a drop too much and
never was guilty of a single dishonest action  Day after day passed by
like all preceding days in unbroken level succession without even the
excitement of meetinghouse emotion  Naturally therefore his wifes
proposals made him uneasy and even alarmed him  He shrank from them
unconsciously and yet his aversion was perfectly wise more so perhaps
than any action for which he could have assigned a definite motive  With
men like Mr Furze the unconscious reason which is partly a direction by
past and forgotten experiences and partly instinct is often more to be
trusted than any mental operation strictly socalled  An attempt to use
the mind actively on subjects which are too large or with which it has
not been accustomed to deal is pretty nearly sure to mislead  He knew
or it knew whatever we like to call it that to break him from his
surroundings meant that he himself was to be broken for they were a part
of him
His wife attacked him again the next day  She was bent upon moving and
it is only fair to her to say that she did really wish to go for
Catharines sake  She loved the child in her own way but she also
wanted to go for many other reasons
Well my dear what have you to say to my little scheme
How about my dinner and tea
Come home to the Terrace  How far is it
Ten minutes walk
An hour every day in all weathers and then theres the expense
As to the expense I am certain we should save in the long run because
you would not be expected to be continually asking people to meals
I am afraid that the business might suffer
Nonsense  In what way my dear  Your attention will be more fixed upon
it than it can be with the parlour always behind you
There was something in that and Mr Furze was perplexed  He was not
sufficiently well educated to know that something and a great deal too
can be said for anything and he had not arrived at that callousness to
argument which is the last result of culture
Yes but I was thinking that perhaps if we leave off chapel and go to
church some of our customers may not like it
Now my good man Furze why you know you have as many customers who go
to church as to chapel
Ah but those who go to chapel may drop off
Why should they  We have plenty of customers who go to church  They
dont leave us because we are Dissenters and as there are five times as
many church people as Dissenters your connection will be extended
Mrs Furze was unanswerable but her poor husband after all was right
The change when it took place did not bring more people to the shop
and some left who were in the habit of coming  His dumb dull
presentiment was a prophecy and his wifes logic was nothing but words
Then there are all the rooms here what shall we do with them
I have told you you want more space  Besides you do not make half
enough show  You ought to go with the times  Why at Crosss at
Cambridge their upstairs windows are hung full of spades and hoes and
such things and you can see it is business up to the garret  I should
turn the parlour into a countinghouse  It isnt the proper thing for
you to be standing always at that pokey little desk at the end of the
counter with a pen behind your ear  Turn the parlour I say into a
countinghouse and come out when Tom finds it necessary to call you
That makes a much better impression  The rooms above the drawingroom
might be used for lighter goods so as not to weight the floors too
much
Mr Furze was not sentimental but he shuddered  In the big front
bedroom his father and he had been born  The first thing he could
remember was having measles there and watching day by day when he was a
little better what went on in the street below  His brothers and
sisters were also born there  He remembered how his mother was shut up
there and he was not allowed to enter how when he tried the door
Nurse Judkins came and said he must be a good boy and go away and how he
heard a little cry and was told he had a new sister and he wondered how
she got in  In that room his father had died  He was very ill for a
long time and again Nurse Judkins came  He sat up with his father there
night after night and heard the church clock sound all the hours as the
sick man lay waiting for his last  He rallied towards the end and
being very pious he made his son sit down by the bedside and read to him
the ninetyfirst Psalm  He then blessed his boy in that very room and
five minutes afterwards he had rushed from it choked with sobbing when
the last breath was drawn  He did not relish the thought of taking down
the old fourpost bedstead and putting rakes and shovels in its place
but all he could say was
I dont quite fall in with it
Why not  Now my dear I will make a bargain with you  If you can
assign a good reason I will give it up but if you cannot then of
course we ought to go because I have plenty of reasons for going
Nothing can be fairer than that
Mr Furze was not quite clear about the ought although it was so fair
but he was mute and after a pause went into his shop  An accident
decided the question  Catharine was the lightest sleeper in the house
notwithstanding her youth  Two nights after this controversy she awoke
suddenly and smelt something burning  She jumped out of bed flung her
dressinggown over her opened her door and found the landing full of
smoke  Without a moments hesitation she rushed out and roused her
parents  They were both bewildered and hesitated ejaculating all sorts
of useless things  Catharine was impatient
Now then not a second upstairs through Janes bedroom out into the
gutter and through Hopkinss attic  You cannot go downstairs
Still there was trembling and indecision
But the tin box gasped Mr Furze it is in the wardrobe  I must take
it
Catharine replied by literally driving them before her  They picked up
the maidservant crept behind the high parapet and were soon in safety
By this time the smoke was pouring up thick and fast although no flame
had appeared  Suddenly Catharine cried
But where is Tom
Tom was the assistant and slept in an offset at the back  Underneath
him was the kitchen and beyond was the lower offset of the scullery
Catharine darted towards the window
Catharine shrieked her mother where are you going  You cannot you
are not dressed
But she answered not a word and had vanished before anybody could arrest
her  The smoke was worse and almost suffocating but she wrapped her
face and nose in her woollen gown and reached Toms door  He never
slept with it fastened and the amazed youth was awakened by a voice
which he knew to be that of Miss Furze  Escape by the way she had come
was hopeless  The staircase was now opaque  Fortunately Toms casement
instead of being in the side wall was at the end and the drop to the
scullery roof was not above four feet  Catharine reached it easily and
Tom coming after her helped her to scramble down into the yard  The
gate was unbarred and in another minute they were safe with their
neighbours  The town was now stirring and a fireengine came a machine
which attended fires officially and squirted on them officially but was
never known to do anything more save to make the road sloppy  The
thick brick party walls of the houses adjoining saved them but Mr
Furzes house was gutted from top to bottom  It was surrounded by a
crowd the next day which stared unceasingly  The fireengine still
operated on the ashes and a great steam and smother arose  A charred
oak beam hung where it had always hung but the roof had disappeared
entirely and the walls of the old bedchamber which had seen so much of
sweetness and of sadness of the mysteries of love birth and death lay
bare to the sky and the street
CHAPTER III
The stone bridge was deeply recessed and in each recess was a stone
seat  In the last recess but one at the north end and on the east
side there sat daily some few years before 1840 a blind man Michael
Catchpole by name selling shoelaces  He originally came out of Suffolk
but he had lived in Eastthorpe ever since he was a boy and had worked
for Mr Furzes father  He was blinded by a splash of melted iron and
was suddenly left helpless a widower with one boy Tom fifteen years
old  His employer the present Mr Furze did nothing for him save
sending him two bottles of lotion which he had heard were good for the
eyes and Mike for a time was confounded  His club helped him so long as
he was actually suffering and confined to his house but their pay did
not last above six weeks  In these six weeks Mike learned much  He was
brought face to face with a blank wall with the pursuer behind himan
experience which teaches more than most books and he was on the point of
doing what some of us have been compelled to dothat is to say to
recognise that the worst is inevitable throw up the arms and bravely
yield  But Mike also learned that this is not always necessary to a man
with courage and that very often escape lies in the last moment the
very last when endurance seems no longer possible  His deliverance did
not burst upon him in rainbow colours out of the sky complete  It was a
very slow affair  He heard that an old woman had died who lived in
Parkers Alley and sold old clothes old iron bottles and such like
trash  Parkers Alley was not very easy to find  Going up High Street
from the bridge you first turned to the right through Cross Street and
then to the right again down Lock Lane and out of Lock Lane ran the
alley a little narrow gutter of a place dark and squalid paved with
round stones through which slops of all kinds perpetually percolated
and gave forth on the cleanest days a faint and sickening odour  Mike
thought he could buy the stock for five shillings the rent was only half
a crown a week and with the help of Tom a remarkably sharp boy who
could tell him in what condition the goods were which were offered him
for purchase he hoped he could manage to make way  It was a dreadful
trial  The old woman had lived amongst all her property  She had eaten
and drunk and slept amidst the dirty rags of Eastthorpe but Mike could
not  Fortunately the cottage was at the end of the alley  One window
looked out on it but the door was in a kind of indentation in it round
the corner  On the righthand side of the door was the room looking into
the alley and this Mike made his shop on the left was a little cupboard
of a livingroom  He kept the shop window open so that no customer came
through the doorway and he begged some scarlet geranium cuttings which
in due time bloomed into brilliant colour on his sittingroom window
sill proclaiming that from their possessor hope and delight in life had
not departed  Alas the enterprise was a failure  Mike was no hand at
driving hard bargains and frequently when the Jew from Cambridge came
round to sweep up what Mike had been unable to sell in the town he found
himself the worse for his purchases  The unscalable wall was again in
front of him and his foe at his heels closer than before and raging
for his blood  He had gone out one morning Tom leading him and was
passing the bank when the cashier ran out  Miss Foster one of the
maiden ladies who it will be remembered lived in the Abbey Close had
left a sovereign on the counter and the cashier was exceedingly anxious
to show his zeal by promptly returning it for Miss Foster it will also
be remembered was a daughter of a former partner in the bank and still
as it was supposed retained some interest in it  She had gone too far
however and the cashier could not venture to leave his post and follow
her  Knowing Mike and Tom perfectly well he asked Mike to take the
sovereign at once to the lady  He promptly obeyed and was in time to
restore it to its owner before it was missed  She was not particularly
sensitive but the sight of Mike and Tom standing at the hall entrance
rather touched her and she rewarded them with a shilling  She was also
pleased to inquire how Mike was getting on and he briefly told her he
did not get on in any way save as the most unsuccessful happily get on
and so at last terminate their perplexities  Miss Foster although well
todo kept neither footman nor page and a thought struck her  She
abhorred male servants but it was very often inconvenient to send her
maids on errands  She therefore suggested to Mike that if he and Tom
could station themselves within call they would not only be useful but
earn something of a livelihood  The bank wanted an odd man occasionally
and she was sure that other people in the town would employ him
Accordingly Mike and Tom one morning established themselves in the recess
of the bridge after having given notice to everybody who would be likely
to assist them and Mike set up a stock of bootlaces and shoelaces of
all kinds  He thus managed to pick up a trifle  He wrapped sacking
round his legs to keep off the cold as he sat and had for a footstool a
box with straw in it  He also rigged up a little awning on some sticks
to keep off the sun and a shower but of course when a storm came he was
obliged to retreat  He was then allowed a shelter in the bank  The dust
was a nuisance for it was difficult to predict its capricious eddies
but he learnt its laws at last and how to choose his station so as to
diminish annoyance  At first he was depressed at the thought of sitting
still for so many hours with nothing to do but he was not left to
himself so much as he anticipated  Two hours on the average were spent
on errands then there was his dinner Tom talked to him people went by
and said a word or two and thus he discovered that a foreseen trouble
may look impenetrable but when we near it or become immersed in it it
is often at least semitransparent and even sometimes admits a ray of
sunshine  Gradually his employment became sweet to him he was a part of
the town he heard all its news it was gentle within him even the rough
boys never molested him he tamed a black kitten to stay with him and a
red ribbon and a bell were provided for her by a friend  When the kitten
grew to be a cat she gravely watched under Mikes awning during his short
absences with Tom and not a soul ever touched the property she guarded
Country folk who came to market on Saturday invariably saluted Mike with
their kind country friendliness and brought him all sorts of little
gifts in the shape of fruit and even of something more substantial when
a pig was killed  Thus with Mike time and the hour wore out the roughest
day
Two years had now passed since his accident and Tom was about seventeen
when Miss Catharine crossed the bridge one fine Monday morning in June
with the servant and as was her wont stopped to have a word or two
with her friend Mike  Mike was always at his best on Monday morning
Sunday was a day of rest but he preferred Monday  It was a delight to
him to hear again the carts and the noise of feet and to feel that the
world was alive once more  Sunday with its enforced quietude and
inactivity was a burden to him
Well Miss Catharine how are you today
How did you know I was Miss Catharine  I hadnt spoken
Lord Miss I could tell  Though its only about two years since I lost
