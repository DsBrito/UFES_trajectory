CHAPTER I
A JUNE WATER
The train a special made up of a private car and a diner was running
on a slow order and crawled between the bluffs at a snails pace
Ahead the sun was sinking into the foothills and wherever the eye
could reach to the horizon barren wastes lay riotously green under the
golden blaze  The river swollen everywhere out of its banks spread
in a broad and placid flood of yellow over the bottoms and a hundred
shallow lakes studded with willowed islands marked its wandering course
to the south and east  The clear far air of the mountains the glory
of the gold on the June hills and the illimitable stretch of waters
below spellbound the group on the observation platform
Its a pity too declared Conductor OBrien who was acting as
mountain Baedeker that were held back this way when were covering
the prettiest stretch on the road for running  It is right along here
where you are riding that the speed records of the world have been
made  Fourteen and sixtenths miles were done in nine and a half
minutes just west of that curve about six months agoof course it was
down hill
Several of the party were listening  Do you use speed recorders out
here asked Allen Harrison
Hows that
Do you use speed recorders
Only on our slow trains replied OBrien  To put speed recorders on
Paddy McGraw or Jimmie the Wind would be like timing a teal duck with
an eightday clock  Sir he asked turning to another questioner
while the laugh lingered on his side  No those are not really
mountains at all  Those are the foothills of the Sleepy Cat
rangewest of the Spider Water  We get into that range about two
hundred miles from herewell I say they are west of the Spider but
for ten days its been hard to say exactly where the Spider is  The
Spider is making us all the trouble with high water just nowand were
coming out into the valley in about a minute he added as the car gave
an embarrassing lurch  The track is certainly soft but if youll
stay right where you are on this side ladies youll get the view of
your lives when we leave the bluffs  The valley is about nine miles
broad and its pretty much all under water
Beyond the curve they were taking lay a long tangent stretching like a
steel wand across a sea of yellow and as their engine felt its way
very gingerly out upon it there rose from the slowmoving trucks of
their car the softened resonance that tells of a soundingboard of
waters
Soon they were drawn among wooded knolls between which hurried little
rivers tossed out of the Spider flood into dry waterways and brawling
with surprised stones and foaming noisily at stubborn root and
impassive culvert  Through the trees the travellers caught passing
glimpses of shaded eddies and a wilderness of placid pools  And
this murmured Gertrude Brock to her sister Marie this is the
Spider  OBrien talking to the men at her elbow overheard
Hardly Miss Brock not yet  You havent seen the river yet  This is
only the backwater
They were rising the grade to the bridge approach and when they
emerged a few moments later from the woods the conductor said There
The panorama of the valley lay before them  High above their level and
a mile away the long threadlike spans of Haileys great bridge
stretched from pier to pier  To the right of the higher ground a fan
of sidetracks spread with lines of flat cars and gondolas loaded with
stone brush piling and timbers and in the foreground two hulking
piledrivers their leads like rabbits ears laid sleekly back
squatted mysteriously  Switch engines puffed impatiently up and down
the ladder track shifting stuff to the distant spurs  At the river
front an army of men moved like loaded ants over the dikes  Beyond
them the eye could mark the boiling yellow of the Spider its winding
channel marked through the waste of waters by whirling driftwood
bobbing wreckage and plunging treessweepings of a thousand angry
miles  Theres the Spider repeated the West End conductor
pointing out there in the middle where you see things moving right
along  Thats the Spider on a twentyyear rampage  The train
moving slowly stopped  I guess weve got as close to it as were
going to for a while  Ill take a look forward
It was the time of the June water in the mountains  A year earlier the
rise had taken the Peace River bridge and with the second heavy year of
snow railroad men looked for new trouble  June is not a month for
despair because the mountain men have never yet scheduled despair as a
West End liability  But it is a month that puts wrinkles in the right
of way clear across the desert and sows gray hairs in the roadmasters
records from McCloud to Bear Dance  That June the mountain streams
roared the foothills floated the plains puffed into sponge and in
the thick of it all the Spider Water took a manslaughtering streak and
started over the Bad Lands across lots  The big river forced Bucks
hand once more and to protect the main line Glover third of the
mountain roadbuilders was ordered off the highline construction and
back to the hills where Brodie and Hailey slept to watch the Spider
The special halted on a tongue of high ground flanking the bridge and
extending upstream to where the river was gnawing at the long dike that
held it off the approach  The delay was tedious  Doctor Lanning and
Allen Harrison went forward to smoke  Gertrude Brock took refuge in a
book and Mrs Whitney her aunt annoyed her with stories  Marie Brock
and Louise Donner placed their chairs where they could watch the
sorting and unloading of neverending strings of flat cars the
spasmodic activity in the lines of laborers the hurrying of the
foremen and the movement of the rapidly shifting fringe of men on the
danger line at the dike
The clouds which had opened for the dying splendor of the day closed
and a shower swept over the valley the conductor came back in his
raincoathis party were at dinner  Are we to be detained much
longer asked Mrs Whitney
For a little while Im afraid replied the trainman diplomatically
Ive been away over there on the dike to see if I could get permission
to cross but I didnt succeed
Oh conductor remonstrated Louise Donner
And we dont get to Medicine Bend tonight said Doctor Lanning
What we need is a man of influence suggested Harrison  We ought
never to have let your pa go he added turning to Gertrude Brock
beside whom he sat
Cant we really get ahead  Gertrude lifted her brows reproachfully
as she addressed the conductor  Its becoming very tiresome
OBrien shook his head
Why not see someone in authority she persisted
I have seen the man in authority and nearly fell into the river doing
it then he turned me down
Did you tell him who we were demanded Mrs Whitney
I made all sorts of pleas
Does he know that Mr Bucks promised we should be In Medicine Bend
tonight asked pretty little Marie Brock
He wouldnt in the least mind that
Mrs Whitney bridled  Pray who is he
The construction engineer of the mountain division is the man in
charge of the bridge just at present
It would be a very simple matter to get orders over his head
suggested Harrison
Not very
Mr Bucks
Hardly  No orders would take us over that bridge tonight without
Glovers permission
What an autocrat sighed Mrs Whitney  No matter I dont care to
go over it anyway
But I do protested Gertrude  I dont feel like staying in this
water all night if you please
Im afraid thats what well have to do for a few hours  I told Mr
Glover he would be in trouble if I didnt get my people to Medicine
Bend tonight
Tell him again laughed Doctor Lanning
Conductor OBrien looked embarrassed  Youd like to ask particular
leave of Mr Glover for us I know suggested Miss Donner
Well hardlythe second timenot of Mr Glover  A sheet of rain
drenched the plateglass windows  But Im going to watch things and
well get out just as soon as possible  I know Mr Glover pretty well
He is all right but hes been down here now a week without getting out
of his clothes and the river rising on him every hour  Theyve got
every grain bag between Salt Lake and Chicago and theyre filling them
with sand and dumping them in where the river is cutting
Any danger of the bridge going asked the doctor
None in the world but theres a lot of danger that the river will go
That would leave the bridge hanging over dry land  The fight is to
hold the main channel where it belongs  Theyre getting rock over the
bridge from across the river and strengthening the approach for fear
the dike should give way  The track is busy every minute so I
couldnt make much impression on Mr Glover
There was light talk of a deputation to the dike followed by the
resignation of travellers cards afterward and pingpong  With the
deepening of the night the rain fell harder and the wind rising in
gusts drove it against the glass  When the women retired to their
compartments the train had been set over above the bridge where the
wind now hard from the southeast sung steadily around the car
Gertrude Brock could not sleep  After being long awake she turned on
the light and looked at her watch it was one oclock  The wind made
her restless and the air in the stateroom had become oppressive  She
dressed and opened her door  The lights were very low and the car was
silent all were asleep
At the rear end she raised a windowshade  The night was lighted by
strange waves of lightning and thunder rumbled in the distance
unceasingly  Where she sat she could see the sidings filled with cars
and when a sharper flash lighted the backwater of the lakes vague
outlines of faroff bluffs beetled into the sky
She drew the shade for the continuous lightning added to her disquiet
As she did so the rain drove harshly against the car and she retreated
to the other side  Feeling presently the coolness of the air she
walked to her stateroom for her Newmarket coat and wrapping it about
her sunk into a chair and closed her eyes  She had hardly fallen
asleep when a crash of thunder split the night and woke her  As it
rolled angrily away she quickly raised the windowcurtain
The heavens were frenzied  She looked toward the river  Electrical
flashes charging from end to end of the angry sky lighted the bridge
reflected the black face of the river and paled flickering lights and
flaming torches where on vanishing stretches of dike an army of dim
figures moving unceasingly lent awe to the spectacle
She could see smoke from the hurrying switch engines whirled viciously
up into the sweeping night and above her head the wind screamed  A
gale from the southwest was hurling the Spider against the revetment
that held the eastern shore and the day and the night gangs together
were reinforcing it  Where the dike gave under the terrific pounding
or where swiftly boiling pools sucked under the heavy piling Glovers
men were sinking fresh relays of mattresses and loading them with stone
At moments laden flat cars were pushed to the brink of the flood and
men with picks and bars rose spiritlike out of black shadows to
scramble up their sides and dump rubble on the sunken brush  Other men
toiling in unending procession wheeled and slung sandbags upon the
revetment others stirred crackling watchfires that leaped high into
the rain and over all played the incessant lightning and the angry
thunder and the flying night
She shut from her eyes the strangely moving sight returned to her
compartment closed her door and lay down  It was quieter within the
little room and the fury of the storm was less appalling
Half dreaming as she lay mountains shrouded in a deathly lightning
loomed wavering before her and one most terrible of all she strove
unwillingly to climb  Up she struggled clinging and slipping a
cramping fear over all her senses her ankles clutched in icy fetters
until from above an apparition strange and threatening pushed her
screaming and she swooned into an awful gulf
Gertrude  Gertrude  Wake up cried a frightened voice
The car was rocking in the wind and as Gertrude opened her door Louise
Donner stumbled terrified into her arms  Did you hear that awful
awful crash  Im sure the car has been struck
No no Louise
It surely has been  Oh let us waken the men at once Gertrude we
shall be killed
The two clung to one another  Im afraid to stay alone Gertrude
sobbed her companion
Stay with me Louise  Come  While they spoke the wind died and for
a moment the lightning ceased but the calm like the storm was
terrifying  As they stood breathless a report like the ripping of a
battery burst over their heads a blast shook the heavy car and howled
shrilly away
Sleep was out of the question  Gertrude looked at her watch  It was
four oclock  The two dressed and sat together till daylight  When
morning broke dark and gray the storm had passed and out of the
leaden sky a drizzle of rain was falling  Beside the car men were
moving  The forward door was open and the conductor in his stormcoat
walked in
Everything is all right this morning ladies he smiled
All right  I should think everything all wrong exclaimed Louise
We have been frightened to death
Theyve got the cutting stopped continued OBrien smiling  Mr
Glover has left the dike  He just told me the river had fallen six
inches since two oclock  Well be out of here now as quick as we can
get an engine theyve been switching with ours  There was
considerable wind in the night
Considerable wind
You didnt notice it did you  Glover loaded the bridge with freight
trains about twelve oclock and Im thinking its lucky for when the
wind went into the northeast about four oclock I thought it would take
my head off  It snapped like dynamite clear across the valley
Oh we heard
When the wind jumped a crew was dumping stone into the river  The
men were ordered off the flat cars but there were so many they didnt
all get the word at once and while the foreman was chasing them down
he was blown clean into the river
Drowned
No he was not  He crawled out away down by the bridge though a man
couldnt have done it once in a thousand times  It was old Bill
Dancinghes got more lives than a cat  Do you remember where we
first pulled up the train in the afternoon  A string of ten box cars
stood there last night and when the wind shifted it blew the whole
bunch off the track
Oh do let us get away from here urged Gertrude  I feel as if
something worse would happen if we stayed  Im sorry we ever left
McCloud yesterday
The men came from their compartments and there was more talk of the
storm  Clem and his helpers were starting breakfast in the diningcar
and the doctor and Harrison wanted to walk down to see where the river
had cut into the dike  Mrs Whitney had not appeared and they asked
the young ladies to go with them  Gertrude objected  A foggy haze
hung over the valley
Come along urged Harrison the air will give you an appetite
After some remonstrating she put on her heavy coat and carrying
umbrellas the four started under the conductors guidance across to the
dike  They picked their steps along curving tracks between material
piles and through the debris of the night  On the dike they spent some
time looking at the gaps and listening to explanations of how the river
worked to undermine and how it had been checked  Watchers hooded in
yellow stickers patrolled the narrow jetties or motionless studied
the eddies boiling at their feet
Returning the party walked around the edge of the camp where cooks
were busy about steaming kettles  Under long open tents wearied men
lying on scattered hay slept after the hardship of the night  In the
drizzling haze half a dozen men assistants to the engineerrough
looking but strongfeatured and quickeyedsat with buckets of
steaming coffee about a huge campfire  Four men bearing a litter came
down the path  Doctor Lanning halted them  A laborer had been pinched
during the night between loads of piling projecting over the ends of
flat cars and they told the doctor his chest was hurt  A soiled
neckcloth covered his face but his stertorous breathing could be heard
and Gertrude Brock begged the doctor to go to the camp with the injured
man and see whether something could not be done to relieve him until
the company surgeon arrived  The doctor with OBrien turned back
Gertrude depressed by the incident followed Louise and Allen Harrison
along the path which wound round a clump of willows flanking the
campfire
On the sloping bank below the trees and a little out of the wind a man
on a mattress of willows lay stretched asleep  He was clad in leather
mudstained and wrinkled and the big brown boots that cased his feet
were strapped tightly above his knees  An arm outstretched supported
his head hidden under a soft gray hat  Like the thick gloves that
covered his clasped hands his hat and the handkerchief knotted about
his neck were soaked by the rain falling quietly and trickling down
the furrows of his leather coat  But his attitude was one of
exhaustion and trifles of discomfort were lost in his deep respiration
Oh exclaimed Gertrude Brock under her breath look at that poor
fellow asleep in the rain  Allen
Allen Harrison ahead was struggling to hold his umbrella upright
while he rolled a cigarette  He turned as he passed the paper across
his lips
Throw your coat over him Allen
Harrison pasted the paper roll and putting it to his mouth felt for
his matchcase  Throw my coat over him
Yes
Allen took out a match  Well I like that  Thats like you
Gertrude  Suppose you throw your coat over him
Gertrude looked silently at her companion  There is a moment when
women should be humored not all men are fortunate enough to recognize
it  Louise still walking ahead called Come on but Gertrude did
not move
Allen throw your coat over the poor fellow she urged  You
wouldnt let your dog lie like that in the rain
But Gertrudedo me the kindnesshe passed his umbrella to her that
he might better manage the lightinghes not my dog
If she made answer it was only in the expression of her eyes  She
handed the umbrella back flung open her long coat and slipped it from
her shoulders  With the heavy garment in her hands she stepped from
her path toward the sleeper and noticed for the first time an utterly
disreputablelooking dog lying beside him in the weeds  The dogs long
hair was bedraggled to the color of the mud he curled in and as he
opened his eyes without raising his head Gertrude hesitated but his
tail spoke a kindly greeting  He knew no harm was meant and he watched
unconcernedly while determined not to recede from her impulse
Gertrude stepped hastily to the sleepers side and dropped her coat
over his shoulders
Louise was too far ahead to notice the incident  After breakfast she
asked Gertrude what the matter was
Nothing  Allen and I had our first quarrel this morning
As she spoke the train high in the air was creeping over the Spider
bridge
CHAPTER II
AN ERROR AT HEADQUARTERS
When the BrockHarrison party familiarly knownamong those with whom
they were by no means familiaras the Steel Crowd bought the
transcontinental lines that J S Bucks the second vicepresident and
general manager had built up into a system their first visit to the
West End was awaited with some uneasiness  An impression prevailed that
the new owners might take decided liberties with what Conductor OBrien
termed the personal of the operating department
But week after week followed the widely heralded announcement of the
purchase without the lookedfor visit from the new owners  During the
interval West End men from the general superintendent down were
admittedly on edgewith the exception of Conductor OBrien  If I go I
go was all he said and in making the statement in his even
significant way it was generally understood that the trainman that ran
the paycars and the swell mountain specials had in view a
superintendency on the New York Central  On what he rested his
confidence in the opening no one certainly knew though Pat Francis
claimed it was based wholly on a cigar in a glass case once given to the
genial conductor by Chauncey M Depew when travelling special to the
coast under his charge
Be that as it may when the West End was at last electrified by the
announcement that the BrockHarrison syndicate train had already crossed
the Missouri and might be expected any day OBrien with his usual luck
was detailed as one of the conductors to take charge of the visitors
The pang in the operating department was that the longdelayed inspection
tour should have come just at a time when the water had softened things
until every train on the mountain division was run under sloworders
At McCloud Vicepresident Bucks a very old campaigner had held the
party for two days to avoid the adverse conditions in the west and turned
the financiers of the party south to inspect branches while the road was
drying in the hills  But the party of visitors contained two distinct
elements the moneymakers and the moneyspendersthe generation that
made the investment and the generation that distributed the dividends
The young people rebelled at branch line trips and insisted on heading
for sightseeing and hunting straight into the mountains  Accordingly at
McCloud the party split and while Henry S Brock and his business
associates looked over the branches his private cars containing his
family and certain of their friends were headed for the headquarters of
the mountain division Medicine Bend
Medicine Bend is not quite the same town it used to be and
disappointment must necessarily attend efforts to identify the once
familiar landmarks of the mountain division  Improvement implacable
priestess of American industry has wellnigh obliterated the picturesque
features of pioneer days  The very right of way of the earliest overland
line abandoned for miles and miles is seen now from the car windows
bleaching on the desert  So once its own rails vigorous and aggressive
skirted grinning heaps of buffalo bones and its own tangents were spiked
across the grave of pony rider and Indian bravethe king was the king
is
But the Sweetgrass winds are the same  The same snows whiten the peaks
the same sun dies in western glory and the mountains still see nestling
among the tracks at the bend of the Medicine River the first headquarters
building of the mountain division nicknamed The Wickiup  What in the
face of continual and unrelenting changes could have saved the Wickiup
Not the fact that the crazy old gables can boast the storm and stress of
the mad railroad life of another day than thisfor every deserted curve
and hill of the line can do as much  The Wickiup has a better claim to
immortality for once its cracked and smoky walls raised solely to house
the problems and perplexities of the operating department sheltered a
pair of lovers so strenuous in their perplexities that even yet in the
gleam of the long nightfires of the West End their story is told
In that day the construction department of the mountain division was
cooped up at one end of the hall on the second floor of the building
Bucks at that time thought twice before he indorsed one of Glovers
twentythousanddollar specifications  Now with the department
occupying the entire third floor and pushing out of the dormer windows a
milliondollar estimate goes through like a requisition for postage
stamps
But in spite of his holeinthewall office Glover the construction
engineer of that day was a man to be reckoned with in estimates of West
End men  They knew him for a captain long before he left his mark on the
Spider the time he held the river for a straight week at twentyeight
feet bitted and gagged between Haileys piers and forced the yellow
tramp to understand that if it had killed Hailey there were equally bad
men left on the mountain payroll  Glover it may be said took his
final degrees in engineering in the Grand Canon he was a member of the
Bush party and of the four that got back alive to Medicine one was Ab
Glover
Glover rebuilt the whole system of snowsheds on the West End practically
everything from the Peace to the Sierras  Every section foreman in the
railroad Bad Lands knew Glover  Just how he happened to lose his
position as chief engineer of the systemfor he was a big man on the
East End when he first came with the roadno one certainly knew  Some
said he spoke his mind too freelya bad trait in a railroad man others
said he could not hold down the job  All they knew in the mountains was
that as a snow fighter he could wear out all the plows on the division
and that if a branch line were needed in haste Glover would have the
rails down before an ordinary man could get his bids in
Ordinarily these things are expected from a mountain constructionist and
elicit no comment from headquarters but the matter at the Spider was one
that could hardly pass unnoticed  For a year Glover had been begging for
a stenographer  Writing to him was as distasteful as sodawater and
one morning soon after his return from the valley flood a letter came
with the news that a competent stenographer had been assigned to him and
would report at once for duty at Medicine Bend
Glover emerged from his halloffice in great spirits and showed the
letter to Callahan the general superintendent for congratulations
That is right commented Callahan cynically  You saved them a hundred
thousand dollars last monththey are going to blow ten a week on you
By the way your stenographer is here
He is
She is  Your stenographer a very dignified young lady came in on
Number One  You had better go and get shaved  She has been in to
inquire for you and has gone to look up a boardingplace  Get her
started as soon as you canI want to see your figures on the Rat Canon
work
A helper now would be a boon from heaven  But she wont stay long after
she sees this office Glover reflected ruefully as he returned to it
He knew from experience that stenographers were hard to hold at Medicine
Bend  They usually came out for their health and left at the slightest
symptoms of improvement  He worried as to whether he might possibly have
been unlucky enough to draw another invalid  And at the very moment he
had determined he would not lose his new assistant if good treatment
would keep her he saw a trainman far down the gloomy hall pointing a
finger in his directionsaw a young lady coming toward him and realized
he ought to have taken time that morning to get shaved
There was nothing to do but make the best of it dismissing his
embarrassment he rose to greet the newcomer  His first reflection was
that he had not drawn an invalid for he had never seen a fresher face in
his life and her bearing had the confidence of health itself
I heard you had been here he said reassuringly as the young lady
hesitated at his door
Pardon me
I heard you had been here he repeated with deference
I wish to send a despatch she replied with an odd intonation  Her
reply seemed so at variance with his greeting that a chill tempered his
enthusiasm  Could they possibly have sent him a deaf stenographerone
worn in the exacting service at headquarters  There was always a fly
somewhere in his ointment and so capable and engaging a young lady
seemed really too good to be true  He saw the message blank in her hand
Let me take it he suggested and added raising his voice It shall
go at once  The young lady gave him the message and sitting down at his
desk he pressed an electric call  Whatever her misfortunes she enlisted
his sympathy instantly and as no one had ever accused him of having a
weak voice he determined he would make the best of the situation  Be
seated please he said  She looked at him curiously  Pray be
seated he repeated more firmly
I desire only to pay for my telegram
Not at all  It isnt necessary  Just be seated
In some bewilderment she sat down on the edge of the chair beside which
she stood
We are cramped for room at present in the construction department he
went on affixing his frank to the telegram  Here Gloomy rush this
my boy said he to the messenger who came through a door connecting
with the operators room  But we have the promise of more space soon
he resumed addressing the young lady hopefully  I have had your desk
placed there to give you the benefit of the south light
The stenographer studied the superintendent of construction with some
surprise  His determination to provide for her comfort was most apparent
and his apologies for his crowded quarters were so sincere that they
could not but appeal to a stranger  Her expression changed  Glover felt
that he ought to ask her to take off her hat but could not for his life
The frankness of her eyes was rather too confusing to support very much
of at once and he busied himself at sorting the blueprints on his table
guiltily aware that she was alive to his unshaven condition  He
endeavored to lead the conversation  We have excellent prospects of a
new headquarters building  As he spoke he looked up  Her eyes were
certainly extraordinary  Could she be laughing at him  The prospect of
a new building had been it was true a joke for many years and evidently
she put no more confidence in the statement than he did himself  Of
course you are aware he continued to bolster his assertion that the
road has been bought by an immensely rich lot of Pittsburg duffers
The stenographer half rose in her chair  Will it not be possible for me
to pay for my message at once she asked somewhat peremptorily
