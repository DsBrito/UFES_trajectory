despair he attempted to kill himself  I was said he as ill as I
could be and I continued to live to sell apples     He afterward
became a gatekeeper and later retailed kvass in the streets   A
happy chance brought him to the notice of a lawyer who interested
himself in him directed his reading and organized his instruction
But his restless disposition drew him back to his wandering life he
traveled over Russia in every direction and tried his hand at every
trade including henceforth that of man of letters
He began by writing a short story Makar Tchoudra which was
published by a provincial newspaper  It is a rather interesting work
but its interest lies more frankly speaking in what it promises than
in what it actually gives  The subject is rather too suggestive of
certain pieces of fiction dear to the romantic school
Gorkys appearance in the world of literature dates from 1893  He had
at this time the acquaintance of the writer Korolenko and thanks to
him soon published Tchelkache which met with a resounding success
Gorky henceforth rejects all traditional methods and free and
untrammeled devotes himself to frankly and directly interpreting life
as he sees it  As he has so far lived only in the society of tramps
himself a tramp and one of the most refractory it has been reserved
for him to write the poem of vagrancy
His preference is for the short story  In seven years he has written
thirty contained in three volumes which in their expressive brevity
sometimes recall Maupassant
The plot is of the simplest  Sometimes there are only two personages
an old beggar and his grandson two workmen a tramp and a Jew a
bakers boy and his assistant two companions in misery
The interest of these stories does not lie in the unraveling of an
intricate plot  They are rather fragments of life bits of biography
covering some particular period without reaching the limits of a real
drama  And these are no more artificially combined than are the events
of real life
Everything that he relates Gorky has seen  Every landscape that he
describes has been seen by him in the course of his adventurous
existence  Each detail of this scenery is fraught for him with some
remembrance of distress or suffering  This vagrant life has been his
own  These tramps have been his companions he has loved or hated
them  Therefore his work is alive with what he has almost
unconsciously put in of himself  At the same time he knows how to
separate himself from his work the characters introduced live their
own lives independent of his having their own characters and their
own individual way of reacting against the common misery  No writer
has to a greater degree the gift of objectivity while at the same time
freely introducing himself into his work
Therefore his tramps are strikingly truthful  He does not idealise
them the sympathy that their strength courage and independence
inspire in him does not blind him  He conceals neither their faults
vices drunkenness nor boastfulness  He is without indulgence for
them and judges them discriminatingly  He paints reality but
without for all that exaggerating ugliness  He does not avoid
painful or coarse scenes but in the most cynical passages he does not
revolt because it is felt that he only desires to be truthful and not
to excite the emotions by cheap means  He simply points out that
things are as they are that there is nothing to be done about it that
they depend upon immutable laws  Accordingly all those sad even
horrible spectacles are accepted as life itself  To Gorky the
spectacle presented by these characters is only natural he has seen
them shaken by passion as the waves by the wind and a smile pass over
their souls like the sun piercing the clouds  He is in the true
acceptation of the term a realist
The introduction of tramps in literature is the great innovation of
Gorky  The Russian writers first interested themselves in the
cultivated classes of society then they went as far as the moujik
The literature of the moujik assumed a social importance  It had a
political influence and was not foreign to the abolition of serfdom
In the story Malva Gorky offers us two characteristic types of
peasants who become tramps by insensible degrees almost without
suspecting it through the force of circumstances  One of them is
Vassili  When he left the village he fully intended to return  He
went away to earn a little money for his wife and children  He found
employment in a fishery  Life was easy and joyous  For a while he
sent small sums of money home but gradually the village and the old
life faded away and became less and less real  He ceased to think of
them  His son Iakov came to seek him and to procure work for himself
for a season  He had the true soul of a peasant
Later he falls like the others under the spell of this easy free
life and one feels that Iakov will never more return to the village
In Gorkys eyes his work is tainted by a capital vice  It is unsuited
to producing the joy that quickens  Humanity has forgotten joy what
has he done beyond pitying or rallying suffering     These
reflections haunt him and this doubt of his beneficent efficacy
imparts extreme sadness to his genius

TwentySix and One
BY MAXIME GORKY
There were twentysix of ustwentysix living machines locked up in
a damp cellar where we patted dough from morning till night making
biscuits and cakes  The windows of our cellar looked out into a
ditch which was covered with bricks grown green from dampness the
window frames were obstructed from the outside by a dense iron
netting and the light of the sun could not peep in through the
panes which were covered with flourdust  Our proprietor stopped up
our windows with iron that we might not give his bread to the poor or
to those of our companions who being out of work were starving our
proprietor called us cheats and gave us for our dinner tainted
garbage instead of meat
It was stifling and narrow in our box of stone under the low heavy
ceiling covered with smokeblack and spiderwebs  It was close and
disgusting within the thick walls which were spattered with stains
of mud and mustiness     We rose at five oclock in the morning
without having had enough sleep and dull and indifferent we seated
ourselves by the table at six to make biscuits out of the dough
which had been prepared for us by our companions while we were
asleep  And all day long from morning till ten oclock at night
some of us sat by the table rolling out the elastic dough with our
hands and shaking ourselves that we might not grow stiff while the
others kneaded the dough with water  And the boiling water in the
kettle where the cracknels were being boiled was purring sadly and
thoughtfully all day long the bakers shovel was scraping quickly
and angrily against the oven throwing off on the hot bricks the
slippery pieces of dough  On one side of the oven wood was burning
from morning till night and the red reflection of the flame was
trembling on the wall of the workshop as though it were silently
mocking us  The huge oven looked like the deformed head of a
fairytale monster  It looked as though it thrust itself out from
underneath the floor opened its wide mouth full of fire and
breathed on us with heat and stared at our endless work through the
two black airholes above the forehead  These two cavities were like
eyespitiless and impassible eyes of a monster they stared at us
with the same dark gaze as though they had grown tired of looking at
slaves and expecting nothing human from them despised them with the
cold contempt of wisdom  Day in and day out amid flourdust and mud
and thick badodored suffocating heat we rolled out the dough and
made biscuits wetting them with our sweat and we hated our work
with keen hatred we never ate the biscuit that came out of our
hands preferring black bread to the cracknels  Sitting by a long
table one opposite the othernine opposite ninewe mechanically
moved our hands and fingers during the long hours and became so
accustomed to our work that we no longer ever followed the motions of
our hands  And we had grown so tired of looking at one another that
each of us knew all the wrinkles on the faces of the others  We had
nothing to talk about we were used to this and were silent all the
time unless abusing one anotherfor there is always something for
which to abuse a man especially a companion  But we even abused one
another very seldom  Of what can a man be guilty when he is half
dead when he is like a statue when all his feelings are crushed
under the weight of toil  But silence is terrible and painful only
to those who have said all and have nothing more to speak of but to
those who never had anything to sayto them silence is simple and
easy     Sometimes we sang and our song began thus During work
some one would suddenly heave a sigh like that of a tired horse and
would softly start one of those drawling songs whose touchingly
caressing tune always gives ease to the troubled soul of the singer
One of us sang and at first we listened in silence to his lonely
song which was drowned and deafened underneath the heavy ceiling of
the cellar like the small fire of a woodpile in the steppe on a
damp autumn night when the gray sky is hanging over the earth like a
leaden roof  Then another joined the singer and now two voices
soar softly and mournfully over the suffocating heat of our narrow
ditch  And suddenly a few more voices take up the songand the song
bubbles up like a wave growing stronger louder as though moving
asunder the damp heavy walls of our stony prison
All the twentysix sing loud voices singing in unison fill the
workshop the song has no room there it strikes against the stones
of the walls it moans and weeps and reanimates the heart by a soft
tickling pain irritating old wounds and rousing sorrow
The singers breathe deeply and heavily some one unexpectedly leaves
off his song and listens for a long time to the singing of his
companions and again his voice joins the general wave  Another
mournfully exclaims Eh sings his eyes closed and it may be that
the wide heavy wave of sound appears to him like a road leading
somewhere far away like a wide road lighted by the brilliant sun
and he sees himself walking there
The flame is constantly trembling in the oven the bakers shovel is
scraping against the brick the water in the kettle is purring and
the reflection of the fire is trembling on the wall laughing in
silence     And we sing away with some one elses words our
dull sorrow the heavy grief of living men robbed of sunshine the
grief of slaves  Thus we lived twentysix of us in the cellar of a
big stony house and it was hard for us to live as though all the
three stories of the house had been built upon our shoulders
But besides the songs we had one other good thing something we all
loved and which perhaps came to us instead of the sun  The second
story of our house was occupied by an embroidery shop and there
among many girl workers lived the sixteen year old chambermaid
Tanya  Every morning her little pink face with blue cheerful
eyes leaned against the pane of the little window in our hallway
door and her ringing kind voice cried to us Little prisoners
Give me biscuits
We all turned around at this familiar clear sound and joyously
kindheartedly looked at the pure maiden face as it smiled to us
delightfully  We were accustomed and pleased to see her nose
flattened against the windowpane and the small white teeth that
flashed from under her pink lips which were open with a smile  We
rush to open the door for her pushing one another she enters
cheerful and amiable and holding out her apron  She stands before
us leaning her head somewhat on one side and smiles all the time  A
thick long braid of chestnut hair falling across her shoulder lies
on her breast  We dirty dark deformed men look up at her from
belowthe threshold was four steps higher than the floorwe look at
her lifting our heads upwards we wish her a good morning  We say
to her some particular words words we use for her alone  Speaking
to her our voices are somehow softer and our jokes lighter
Everything is different for her  The baker takes out a shovelful of
the brownest and reddest biscuits and throws them cleverly into
Tanyas apron
Look out that the boss doesnt see you we always warn her  She
laughs roguishly and cries to us cheerfully
Goodby little prisoners and she disappears quickly like a
little mouse  Thats all  But long after her departure we speak
pleasantly of her to one another  We say the very same thing we said
yesterday and before because she as well as we and everything
around us is also the same as yesterday and before  It is very hard
and painful for one to live when nothing changes around him and if
it does not kill his soul for good the immobility of the
surroundings becomes all the more painful the longer he lives  We
always spoke of women in such a manner that at times we were
disgusted at our own rude and shameless words and this is quite
clear for the women we had known perhaps never deserved any better
words  But of Tanya we never spoke ill  Not only did none of us
ever dare to touch her with his hand she never even heard a free
jest from us  It may be that this was because she never stayed long
with us she flashed before our eyes like a star coming from the sky
and then disappeared or perhaps because she was small and very
beautiful and all that is beautiful commands the respect even of
rude people  And then though our hard labor had turned us into dull
oxen we nevertheless remained human beings and like all human
beings we could not live without worshipping something  We had
nobody better than she and none except her paid any attention to
us the dwellers of the cellar no one though tens of people lived
in the house  And finallythis is probably the main reasonwe all
considered her as something of our own as something that existed
only because of our biscuits  We considered it our duty to give her
hot biscuits and this became our daily offering to the idol it
became almost a sacred custom which bound us to her the more every
day  Aside from the biscuits we gave Tanya many advicesto dress
more warmly not to run fast on the staircase nor to carry heavy
loads of wood  She listened to our advice with a smile replied to
us with laughter and never obeyed us but we did not feel offended at
this  All we needed was to show that we cared for her  She often
turned to us with various requests  She asked us for instance to
open the heavy cellar door to chop some wood  We did whatever she
wanted us to do with joy and even with some kind of pride
But when one of us asked her to mend his only shirt she declined
with a contemptuous sneer
We laughed heartily at the queer fellow and never again asked her
for anything  We loved her all is said in this  A human being
always wants to bestow his love upon some one although he may
sometime choke or slander him he may poison the life of his neighbor
with his love because loving he does not respect the beloved  We
had to love Tanya for there was no one else we could love
At times some one of us would suddenly begin to reason thus
And why do we make so much of the girl  Whats in her  Eh  We
have too much to do with her  We quickly and rudely checked the man
who dared to say such words  We had to love something  We found it
out and loved it and the something which the twentysix of us loved
had to be inaccessible to each of us as our sanctity and any one
coming out against us in this matter was our enemy  We loved
perhaps not what was really good but then we were twentysix and
therefore we always wanted the thing dear to us to be sacred in the
eyes of others  Our love is not less painful than hatred  And
perhaps this is why some haughty people claim that our hatred is more
flattering than our love  But why then dont they run from us if
that is true
Aside from the biscuit department our proprietor had also a shop for
white bread it was in the same house separated from our ditch by a
wall the bulochniks whitebread bakers there were four of them
kept aloof considering their work cleaner than ours and therefore
considering themselves better than we were they never came to our
shop laughed at us whenever they met us in the yard nor did we go
to them  The proprietor had forbidden this for fear lest we might
steal loaves of white bread  We did not like the bulochniks
because we envied them  Their work was easier than ours they were
better paid they were given better meals theirs was a spacious
light workshop and they were all so clean and healthyrepulsive to
us while we were all yellow and gray and sickly  During holidays
and whenever they were free from work they put on nice coats and
creaking boots two of them had harmonicas and they all went to the
city park while we had on dirty rags and burst shoes and the city
police did not admit us into the parkcould we love the bulochniks
One day we learned that one of their bakers had taken to drink that
the proprietor had discharged him and hired another one in his place
and that the other one was a soldier wearing a satin vest and a gold
chain to his watch  We were curious to see such a dandy and in the
hope of seeing him we now and again one by one began to run out
into the yard
But he came himself to our workshop  Kicking the door open with his
foot and leaving it open he stood on the threshold and smiling
said to us
God help you  Hello fellows The cold air forcing itself in at
the door in a thick smoky cloud was whirling around his feet he
stood on the threshold looking down on us from above and from under
his fair curled moustache big yellow teeth were flashing  His
waistcoat was blue embroidered with flowers it was beaming and the
buttons were of some red stones  And there was a chain too  He was
handsome this soldier tall strong with red cheeks and his big
light eyes looked goodkind and clear  On his head was a white
stifflystarched cap and from under his clean apron peeped out sharp
toes of stylish brightly shining boots
Our baker respectfully requested him to close the door he did it
without haste and began to question us about the proprietor  Vieing
with one another we told him that our boss was a rogue a rascal
a villain a tyrant everything that could and ought to be said of
our proprietor but which cannot be repeated here  The soldier
listened stirred his moustache and examined us with a soft light
look
And are there many girls here he asked suddenly
Some of us began to laugh respectfully others made soft grimaces
some one explained to the soldier that there were nine girls
Do you take advantage    asked the soldier winking his eye
Again we burst out laughing not very loud and with a confused
laughter  Many of us wished to appear before the soldier just as
clever as he was but not one was able to do it  Some one confessed
saying in a low voice
It is not for us
Yes it is hard for you said the soldier with confidence
examining us fixedly  You havent the bearing for it    the
figureyou havent the appearance I mean  And a woman likes a good
appearance in a man  To her it must be perfect everything perfect
And then she respects strength     A hand should be like this
The soldier pulled his right hand out of his pocket  The shirt
sleeve was rolled up to his elbow  He showed his hand to us
It was white strong covered with glossy golden hair
A leg a chest in everything there must be firmness  And then
again the man must be dressed according to style     As the
beauty of things requires it  I for instance I am loved by women
I dont call them I dont lure them they come to me of themselves
He seated himself on a bag of flour and told us how the women loved
him and how he handled them boldly  Then he went away and when the
door closed behind him with a creak we were silent for a long time
thinking of him and of his stories  And then suddenly we all began
to speak and it became clear at once that he pleased every one of
us  Such a kind and plain fellow  He came sat awhile and talked
Nobody came to us before nobody ever spoke to us like this so
friendly    And we all spoke of him and of his future successes
with the embroidery girls who either passed us by closing their
lips insultingly when they met us in the yard or went straight on
as if we had not been in their way at all  And we always admired
them meeting them in the yard or when they went past our
windowsin winter dressed in some particular hats and in fur coats
in summer in hats with flowers with colored parasols in their hands
But thereafter among ourselves we spoke of these girls so that had
they heard it they would have gone mad for shame and insult
However see that he doesnt spoil Tanushka too said the baker
suddenly with anxiety
We all became silent dumbfounded by these words  We had somehow
forgotten Tanya it looked as though the soldiers massive handsome
figure prevented us from seeing her  Then began a noisy dispute
Some said that Tanya would not submit herself to this others argued
that she would not hold out against the soldier still others said
that they would break the soldiers bones in case he should annoy
Tanya and finally all decided to look after the soldier and Tanya
and to warn the girl to be on guard against him     This put an
end to the dispute
About a month went by  The soldier baked white bread walked around
with the embroidery girls came quite often to our workshop but
never told us of his success with the girls he only twisted his
moustache and licked his lips with relish
Tanya came every morning for the biscuits and as always was
cheerful amiable kind to us  We attempted to start a conversation
with her about the soldier but she called him a goggleeyed calf
and other funny names and this calmed us  We were proud of our
little girl seeing that the embroidery girls were making love to the
soldier  Tanyas relation toward him somehow uplifted all of us and
we as if guided by her relation began to regard the soldier with
contempt  And we began to love Tanya still more and meet her in
the morning more cheerfully and kindheartedly
But one day the soldier came to us a little intoxicated seated
himself and began to laugh and when we asked him what he was
laughing at he explained Two had a fight on account of me
Lidka and Grushka     How they disfigured each other  Ha ha
One grabbed the other by the hair and knocked her to the ground in
the hallway and sat on her     Ha ha ha  They scratched each
others faces     It is laughable  And why cannot women fight
honestly  Why do they scratch  Eh
He sat on the bench strong and clean and jovial talking and
laughing all the time  We were silent  Somehow or other he seemed
repulsive to us this time
How lucky I am with women Eh  It is very funny  Just a wink and I
have them
His white hands covered with glossy hair were lifted and thrown
back to his knees with a loud noise  And he stared at us with such a
pleasantly surprised look as though he really could not understand
why he was so lucky in his affairs with women  His stout red face
was radiant with happiness and selfsatisfaction and he kept on
licking his lips with relish
Our baker scraped the shovel firmly and angrily against the hearth of
the oven and suddenly said sarcastically
You need no great strength to fell little firtrees but try to
throw down a pine
That is do you refer to me asked the soldier
To you
What is it
Nothing     Too late
No wait  Whats the matter  Which pine
Our baker did not reply quickly working with his shovel at the oven
He would throw into the oven the biscuits from the boiling kettle
would take out the ready ones and throw them noisily to the floor to
the boys who put them on bast strings  It looked as though he had
forgotten all about the soldier and his conversation with him  But
suddenly the soldier became very restless  He rose to his feet and
walking up to the oven risked striking his chest against the handle
of the shovel which was convulsively trembling in the air
No you tell mewho is she  You have insulted me     I
Not a single one can wrench herself from me never  And you say to
me such offensive words     And indeed he looked really
offended  Evidently there was nothing for which he might respect
himself except for his ability to lead women astray it may be that
aside from this ability there was no life in him and only this
ability permitted him to feel himself a living man
There are people to whom the best and dearest thing in life is some
kind of a disease of either the body or the soul  They make much of
it during all their lives and live by it only suffering from it
they are nourished by it they always complain of it to others and
thus attract the attention of their neighbors  By this they gain
peoples compassion for themselves and aside from this they have
nothing  Take away this disease from them cure them and they are
rendered most unfortunate because they thus lose their sole means of
living they then become empty  Sometimes a mans life is so poor
that he is involuntarily compelled to prize his defect and live by
it  It may frankly be said that people are often depraved out of
mere weariness  The soldier felt insulted and besetting our baker
roared
Tell mewho is it
Shall I tell you the baker suddenly turned to him
Well
Do you know Tanya
Well
Well try
I
You
Her  Thats easy enough
Well see
Youll see  Ha ha
Shell
A months time
What a boaster you are soldier
Two weeks  Ill show you  Who is it  Tanya  Tfoo
Get away I say
Get away     youre bragging
Two weeks thats all
Suddenly our baker became enraged and he raised the shovel against
the soldier  The soldier stepped back surprised kept silent for
awhile and saying ominously in a low voice Very well then he
left us
During the dispute we were all silent interested in the result  But
when the soldier went out a loud animated talk and noise was
started among us
Some one cried to the baker
You contrived a bad thing Pavel
Work replied the baker enraged
We felt that the soldier was touched to the quick and that a danger
was threatening Tanya  We felt this and at the same time we were
seized with a burning pleasant curiositywhat will happen  Will
she resist the soldier  And almost all of us cried out with
confidence
Tanya  She will resist  You cannot take her with bare hands
We were very desirous of testing the strength of our godling we
persistently proved to one another that our godling was a strong
godling and that Tanya would come out the victor in this combat
Then finally it appeared to us that we did not provoke the soldier
enough that he might forget about the dispute and that we ought to
irritate his selflove the more  Since that day we began to live a
particular intensely nervous lifea life we had never lived before
We argued with one another all day long as if we had grown wiser
We spoke more and better  It seemed to us that we were playing a
game with the devil with Tanya as the stake on our side  And when
we had learned from the bulochniks that the soldier began to court
our Tanya we felt so dreadfully good and were so absorbed in our
curiosity that we did not even notice that the proprietor availing
himself of our excitement added to our work fourteen poods a
pood is a weight of forty Russian pounds of dough a day  We did
not even get tired of working  Tanyas name did not leave our lips
all day long  And each morning we expected her with especial
impatience  Sometimes we imagined that she might come to usand
that she would be no longer the same Tanya but another one
However we told her nothing about the dispute  We asked her no
questions and treated her as kindly as before  But something new and
foreign to our former feelings for Tanya crept in stealthily into our
relation toward her and this new something was keen curiosity
sharp and cold like a steel knife
Fellows  Time is up today said the baker one morning commencing
to work
We knew this well without his calling our attention to it but we
gave a start nevertheless
Watch her     Shell come soon suggested the baker  Some one
exclaimed regretfully What can we see
And again a lively noisy dispute ensued  Today we were to learn at
last how far pure and inaccessible to filth was the urn wherein we
had placed all that was best in us  This morning we felt for the
first time that we were really playing a big game that this test of
our godlings purity might destroy our idol  We had been told all
these days that the soldier was following Tanya obstinately but for
some reason or other none of us asked how she treated him  And she
kept on coming to us regularly every morning for biscuits and was the
same as before  This day too we soon heard her voice
Little prisoners  Ive come
We hastened to let her in and when she entered we met her against
our habit in silence  Staring at her fixedly we did not know what
to say to her what to ask her and as we stood before her we formed
a dark silent crowd  She was evidently surprised at our unusual
reception and suddenly we noticed that she turned pale became
restless began to bustle about and asked in a choking voice
Why are you    such
And you asked the baker sternly without taking his eyes off the
