those to whom it seems so are hardly in sympathy with Matthew Arnold
himself And if the discussion seems to any one too often to take the
form of a critical examination let him remember Mr Arnolds own
words in comparing the treatment of Milton by Macaulay and by M
Scherer
Whoever comes to the Essay on Milton with the desire to get
at the real truth about Milton whether as a man or a poet will
feel that the essay in nowise helps him A reader who only wants
rhetoric a reader who wants a panegyric on Milton a panegyric on
the Puritans will find what he wants A reader who wants criticism
will be disappointed
I have endeavoured in dealing with the master of all English critics
in the latter half of the nineteenth century to help the reader who
wants criticism

CHAPTER I
LIFE TILL MARRIAGE AND WORK TILL THE PUBLICATION OF THE POEMS
OF 1853
Even those who are by no means greedy of details as to the biography
of authors may without inconsistency regret that Matthew Arnolds
Letters do not begin till he was just fiveandtwenty And then
they are not copious telling us in particular next to nothing about
his literary work which is later their constant subject till he
was past thirty We could spare schoolboy letters which though often
interesting are pretty identical save when written by little prigs
But the letters of an undergraduateespecially when the person is
Matthew Arnold and the University the Oxford of the years
184145ought to be not a little symptomatic not a little
illuminative We might have learnt from them something more than we
know at present about the genesis and early stages of that not
entirely comprehensible or classifiable form of Liberalism in matters
political ecclesiastical and general which with a kind of altered
Voltairian touch attended his Conservatism in literature Moreover
it is a real loss that we have scarcely anything from his own pen
about his poems before Sohrab and Rustumthat is to say about the
great majority of the best of them By the time at which we have full
and frequent commentaries on himself he is a married man a harnessed
and hardworking inspector of schools feeling himself too busy for
poetry not as yet tempted by promptings within or invitations from
without to betake himself to critical prose in any quantity or
variety Indeed by a not much more than allowable hyperbole we may
say that we start with the book of his poetry all but shut and the
book of his prose all but unopened
We must therefore make what we can of the subject and of course a
great deal more is to be made in such a case of the work than of the
life The facts of the latter are but scanty Matthew Arnold as all
the world knows was the sonthe eldest sonof the famous Dr
Thomas Arnold Headmaster of Rugby and Regius Professor of Modern
History at Oxford where he had earlier been a Fellow of Oriel Dr
Arnold survives in the general memory now chiefly by virtue of his
headmastership which was really a remarkable one whatever
distinction it may owe to the loyalty of such a group of pupils as his
son Dean Stanley Clough Tom Brown Hughes and others But he was
if not positively great a notable and influential person in many
ways As a historian he was alert and intelligent though perhaps too
much under the influence of that subtlest and most dangerous kind of
popular breeze which persuades those on whom it blows that they are
sailing not with but away from the vulgar As a scholar he was
ingenious if not very erudite or deep He was really a master and
has been thought by some good judges a great master of that admirable
late Georgian academic style of English prose which is almost the
equal of the greatest But he was if not exactly cupidus novarum
rerum in Church and State very ready to entertain them he was
curiously deficient in logic and though the religious sense was
strong in him he held and transmitted to his son the heresythe
foundation of all heresiesthat religion is something that you can
bespeak that you can select and arrange to your own taste that it
is not to take or to leave at your peril and as it offers itself
On August 11 1820 Dr Arnold married Mary Penrose and as he had
devoted his teaching energies which were early developed not to
school or university work but to the taking of private pupils at
Laleham on the Thames between Staines and Chertsey their eldest son
was born there on Christmas Eve 1822 He was always enthusiastic
about the Thames valley though not more so than it deserves and in
his very earliest letter January 2 1848 we find record of a visit
when he found the stream with the old volume width shine rapid
fulness kempshott1 and swans unchanged and unequalled He was
only six years old when his father was elected to the headmastership
of Rugby he was educated in his early years at his birthplace where
an uncle the Rev John Buckland carried on the establishment and at
the age of fourteen he was sent to Winchester his fathers school
Here he only remained a year and entered Rugby in August 1837 He
remained there for four years obtaining an open Balliol scholarship
in 1840 though he did not go up till October 1841 In 1840 he had
also gained the prize for poetry at Rugby itself with Alaric at
Rome a piece which was immediately printed but never reprinted
by its author though it is now easily obtainable in the 1896 edition
of those poems of his which fell out of copyright at the seven years
after his death
It is an observation seldom falsified that such exercises by poets
of the higher class display neither their special characteristics
nor any special characteristics at all Matthew Arnolds was not one
of the exceptions It is very much better than most school prize
poems it shows the critical and scholarly character of the writer
with very fair foreshadowing but it does not foreshadow his poetry
in the very least It is quite free from the usual formal faults of a
boys verse except some evidences of a deficient ear especially for
rhyme full and beautiful palaces and days It manages a
rather difficult metre the sixain rhymed ababcc and ending
with an Alexandrine without too much of the monotony which is its
special danger And some of the tricks which the boypoet has caught
are interesting and abode with him such as the anadiplosis
Yes there are stories registered on high
Yes there are stains Times fingers cannot blot
in which kind he was to produce some years later the matchless
Still nursing the unconquerable hope
Still clutching the inviolable shade
of the ScholarGipsy On the whole the thing is correct but
colourless even its melancholy is probably mere Byronism and has
nothing directly to do with the later quality of Dover Beach
and Poor Matthias
Of Mr Arnolds undergraduate years we have unluckily but little
authentic record and as has been said not one letter The most
interesting evidence comes from Principal Shairps wellknown lines in
Balliol Scholars 18401843 written or at least published
many years later in 1873
The one widewelcomed for a fathers fame
Entered with free bold step that seemed to claim
Fame for himself nor on another lean
So full of power yet blithe and debonair
Rallying his friends with pleasant banter gay
Or half adream chaunting with jaunty air
Great words of Goethe catch of Beranger
We see the banter sparkle in his prose
But knew not then the undertone that flows
So calmly sad through all his stately lay2
Like some other persons of much distinction and a great many of
little or none he missed his first in December 1844 and though he
obtained three months later the consolation prize of a Fellowship
at Oriel too he made no postgraduate stay of any length at the
university The then very general though even then not universal
necessity of taking orders before very long would probably in any case
have sent him wandering for it is clear from the first that his bent
was hopelessly anticlerical and he was not merely too honest but
much too proud a man to consent to be put in one of the priests
offices for a morsel of bread It may well be doubtedthough he felt
and expressed not merely in splendid passages of prose and verse for
public perusal but in private letters quite towards the close of his
life that passionate attachment which Oxford more than any other
place of the kind inspireswhether he would have been long at home
there as a resident For the place has at once a certain republicanism
and a certain tyranny about its idea which could not wholly suit the
aspiring and restless spirit of the author of Switzerland None
of her sons is important to Oxfordthe meanest of them has in his
sonship the same quality as the greatest Now it was very much at Mr
Arnolds heart to be important and he was not eager to impart or
share his qualities
However this may be there were ample reasons why he should leave the
fold The Bar though he was actually called and for many years went
circuit as Marshal to his fatherinlaw Mr Justice Wightman would
have suited him in practice if not in principle even less than the
Church and he had no scientific leanings except a taste for botany
Although the constantly renewed cries for some not clearly defined
system of public support for men of letters are as a rule absurd
there is no doubt that Mr Arnold was the very man for a sinecure and
would have justified the existence of Pipe or Hanaper to all
reasonable men But his political friends had done away with nearly
all such things and no one of the very few that remained fell to his
lot His father had died in 1842 but the son served a short
apprenticeship to schoolteaching at Rugby then became private
secretary to Lord Lansdowne the President of the Council it is now
that we first meet him as an epistoler and early in 1851 was
appointed by his chief to an inspectorship of schools Having now a
livelihood he married in June of that year Frances Lucy Wightman
daughter of a judge of the Queens Bench Their first child Thomas
was born on July 6 1852 and Mr Arnold was now completely estated in
the three positions of husband father and inspector of schools
which occupiedto his great delight in the first two cases not quite
so in the thirdmost of his life that was not given to literature
Some not ungenerous but perhaps rather unnecessary indignation has
been spent upon his drudgery and its scanty rewards It is enough to
say that few men can arrange at their pleasure the quantity and
quality of their work and that not every man even of genius has had
his breadandbutter secured for life at eightandtwenty
But in the ten or twelve years which had passed since Alaric at
Rome literature itself had been by no means neglected and in
another twelvemonth after the birth of his firstborn Matthew Arnold
had practically established his claim as a poet by utterances to which
he made comparatively small additions later though more than half his
life was yet to run And he had issued one prose exercise in
criticism of such solidity and force as had not been shown by any
poet since Dryden except Coleridge
These documents can hardly be said to include the Newdigate poem
Cromwell of 1843 they consist of The Strayed Reveller and other
Poems by A 1849 Empedocles on Etna and other Poems still
by A 1852 and Poems by Matthew Arnold a new edition 1853the
third consisting of the contents of the two earlier with Empedocles
and a few minor things omitted but with very important additions
including Sohrab and Rustum The Church of Brou Requiescat and
The ScholarGipsy The contents of all three must be carefully
considered and the consideration may be prefaced by a few words on
Cromwell
This Greek agonisma like the other Mr Arnold never included in
any collection of his work but it was printed at Oxford in the year
of its success and again at the same place separately or with other
prize poems in 1846 1863 and 1891 It may also be found in the
useful noncopyright edition above referred to Couched in the
consecrated couplet but not as of old limited to fifty lines it is
good rhymes as the elder Mr Pope used to say to the younger but a
prudent taster would perhaps have abstained even more carefully than
in the case of the Alaric from predicting a real poet in the
author It is probably better than six Newdigates out of seven at
least but it has no distinction The young but not so very young
poethe was as old as Tennyson when he produced his unequal but
wonderful first volumebegins by borrowing Wordsworths two voices of
the mountain and the sea shows some impression here and there from
Tennysons own masterissue the great collection of 1842 which had
appeared a year before ventures on an Alexandrine
Between the barren mountains and the stormy sea
which comes as a pleasant relief and displays more than once as he
did afterwards in Tristram and Iseult an uncertain but by no means
infelicitous variety of couplet which he never fully or fairly worked
out but left for Mr William Morris to employ with success many years
later Otherwise the thing is good but negligible It would have
taken an extremely strong competition or an extremely incompetent
examiner to deprive it of the prize but he must have been a sanguine
man who in giving the author that prize expected to receive from him
returns of poetry
Yet they came If we did not know that the middle of this century was
one of the nadirs of English3 criticism and if we did not know
further that even good critics often go strangely wrong both in praise
and in blame of new verse it would be most surprising that The
Strayed Reveller volume should have attracted so little attention
It is full of faults but that is part of the beauty of it Some of
these faults are those which persevering prevented Mr Arnold from
attaining a higher position than he actually holds in poetry but no
critic could know that There is nothing here worse or more
necessarily fatal than many things in Tennysons 1830 and 1832
collections he overwent those so might Mr Arnold have overgone
these And the promisenay the performanceis such as had been seen
in no verse save Tennysons and the almost unnoticed Brownings for
some thirty years The titlepoem though it should have pleased even
a severe judge might have aroused uncomfortable doubts even in an
amiable one In the first place its rhymelessness is a caprice a
willworship Except blank verse every rhymeless metre in English has
on it the curse of the tour de force of the acrobatic Campion
and Collins Southey and Shelley have done great things in it but
neither Rosecheeked Laura nor Evening neither the
great things in Thalaba nor the great things in Queen
Mab can escape the charge of being caprices And caprice as some
have held is the eternal enemy of art
But the caprice of The Strayed Reveller does not cease with its
rhymelessness The rhythm and the linedivision are also studiously
odd unnatural paradoxical Except for the poetic diction of
putting Goddess after Circe instead of before it the first stave
is merely a prose sentence of strictly prosaic though not
inharmonious rhythm But in this stave there is no instance of the
strangest peculiarity and what seems to some the worst fault of the
piece the profusion of brokenup decasyllables which sometimes
suggest a very corrupt manuscript or a passage of that singular
stuff in the Caroline dramatists which is neither blank verse nor any
other nor prose Here are a few out of many instances
Is it then evening
So soon I see the nightdews
Clustered in thick beads dim etc
When the white dawn first
Through the rough firplanks
Thanks gracious One
Ah the sweet fumes again
They see the Centaurs
In the upper glens
One could treble theseindeed in one instance the
sketch of the Indian the entire stanza of eleven lines by the
insertion of one and only becomes a smooth blankverse piece of
seven two of which are indeed hemistichs and three weakended
but only such as are frequent in Shakespeare
They see the Indian drifting knife in hand
His frail boat moored to a floating islethickmatted
With largeleaved and lowcreeping melonplants
And the dark cucumber
He reaps and stows them drifting drifting round him
Round his green harvestplot flow the cool lakewaves
The mountains ring them
Nor perhaps though the poem is a pretty one will it stand criticism
of a different kind much better Such mighty personages as Ulysses and
Circe are scarcely wanted as mere bystanders and supers to an
imaginative young gentleman who enumerates somewhat promiscuously a
few of the possible visions of the Gods There is neither classical
nor romantic nor logical justification for any such mild effect of
the dread Wine of Circe and one is driven to the conclusion that the
author chiefly wanted a frame after his own fashion for a set of
disconnected vignettes like those of Tennysons Palace of Art
and Dream of Fair Women
But if the title poem is vulnerable there is plenty of compensation
The opening sonnet
Two lessons Nature let me learn of thee
is perhaps rather learnt from Wordsworth yet it does not fail to
strike the note which fairly differentiates the Arnoldian variety of
Wordsworthianismthe note which rings from Resignation to
Poor Matthias and which is a very curious cross between two
things that at first sight may seem unmarriageable the Wordsworthian
enthusiasm and the Byronic despair But of this4 more when we have
had more of its examples before us The second piece in the volume
must or should have struckfor there is very little evidence that
it did strikereaders of the volume as something at once considerable
and in no small measure new Mycerinus a piece of some 120
lines or so in thirteen sixline stanzas and a blankverse
coda is one of those characteristic poems of this century
which are neither mere copies of verses mere occasional pieces nor
substantive compositions of the old kind with at least an attempt at
a beginning middle and end They attempt rather situations than
stories rather facets than complete bodies of thought or
description or character They supply an obvious way of escape for
the Romantic tendency which does not wish to break wholly with
classical tradition and above all they admit of indulgence in that
immense variety which seems to have become one of the chief
devices of modern art attempting the compliances necessary to gratify
modern taste
The Herodotean anecdote of the Egyptian King Mycerinus his
indignation at the sentence of death in six years as a recompense for
his just rule and his device of lengthening his days by revelling all
night is neither an unpromising nor a wholly promising subject The
foolish good sense of Mr Toots would probably observeand
justlythat before six years or six months or even six days were
over King Mycerinus must have got very sleepy and the philosophic
mind would certainly recall the parallel of Cleobis and Biton as to
the best gift for man Mr Arnold however draws no direct moral The
stanzapart of the poem the kings expostulation contains very fine
poetry and the note rings again throughout it especially in the
couplet
And prayers and gifts and tears are fruitless all
And the night waxes and the shadows fall
The blankverse tailpiece is finer still in execution it is with
the still finer companioncoda of Sohrab and Rustum the
authors masterpiece in the kind and it is like that an early and
consummate example of Mr Arnolds favourite device of finishing
without a finish of playing out the audience so to speak with
something healing and reconciling description simile what not to
relieve the strain of his generally sad philosophy and his often
melancholy themes
One may less admire despite its famous and oftenquoted line
Who saw life steadily and saw it whole
the sonnet To a Friend praising Homer and Epictetus and
Sophocles for it seems to some to have a smatch of priggishness Nor
am I one of those who think very highly of the much longer Sick
King in Bokhara which with a fragment of an Antigone
whereof more hereafter follows as this sonnet precedes The
Strayed Reveller itself There is the note again and I daresay
the orientalism has the exactness of colour on which as we know from
the Letters Mr Arnold prided himself Yet the handling of the
piece seems to me prolix and uncertain and the drift either very
obscure or somewhat unimportant But about the Shakespeare
sonnet which follows there can be no controversy among the competent
Almost adequate is in such a case the highest praise and it must be
given
The companions of this sonnet are respectable but do not deserve much
warmer words and then we turn to a style of poem remarkably different
from anything which the author had yet published and from most of his
subsequent work It is not unnoteworthy that the batch of poems called
in the later collected editions Switzerland and completed at
last by the piece called On the Terrace at Berne appeared
originally piecemeal and with no indication of connection The first
of its numbers is here To my Friends who Ridiculed a Tender
Leavetaking It applies both the note of thought which has been
indicated and the quality of style which had already disengaged
itself to the commonestthe greatesttheme of poetry but to one
which this poet had not yet triedto Love Let it be remembered that
the thought has the cast of a strictly pessimist quietismthat the
style aims if it aims at any single thing at the reproduction of the
simpler side of classicalism at an almost prim and quakerish
elegance a sort of childlike grace There is however by no
means any great austerity in the tone on the contrary the refrain
altered later
Ere the parting kiss be dry
Quick thy tablets Memory
approaches the luscious It is not easy to decide and it is perhaps
in both senses impertinent to speculate whether the Marguerite
whose La Tourlike portrait is drawn in this piece with such relish
and who is so philosophically left to her fate by her lover on the
Terrace at Berne later had any live original She seems a little more
human in some ways than most of those cloudJunos of the poets the
heroines of sonnetsequence and songstring She herself has a
distinct touch of philosophy anticipating with nonchalant resignation
the years severance and with equally nonchalant anticipation the
time when
Some day next year I shall be
Entering heedless kissed by thee
Her wooer paints her with gusto but scarcely with ardour and ends
with the boding note
Yet if little stays with man
Ah retain we all we can
seeming to be at least as doubtful of his own constancy as of hers
Nor do we meet her again in the volume The wellknown complementary
pieces which make up Switzerland were either not written or
held back
The inferior but interesting Modern Sappho almost the poets
only experiment in Mooreish method and melody
They are goneall is still Foolish heart dost thou quiver
is a curiosity rather than anything else The style is ill suited to
the thought besides Matthew Arnold a master at times of blank
verse and of the statelier stanza was less often an adept at the
lighter and more rushing lyrical measures He is infinitely more at
home in the beautiful New Sirens which for what reason it is
difficult to discover he never reprinted till many years later
partly at Mr Swinburnes most judicious suggestion The scheme is
trochaic and Mr Arnold deriving beyond all doubt inspiration from
Keats was happier than most poets with that charming but difficult
foot The note is the old one of yearning rather than passionate
melancholy applied in a new way and put most clearly though by no
means most poetically in the lines
Can men worship the wan features
The sunk eyes the wailing tone
Of unsphered discrowned creatures
Souls as little godlike as their own
The answer is No of course but as some one informed Mr Arnold
many years later we knew that before and it is distressing to be
told it as we are a little later with a rhyme of dawning and
morning Yet the poem is a very beautiful onein some ways the
equal of its authors best up to this time at least he had yet done
nothing except the Shakespeare sonnet equal to the splendid
stanza beginning
And we too from upland valleys
and the cry of the repentant sirens punished as they had sinned
Come you say the hours are dreary
Yet the strong Tennysonian influence which the poet rather
ungraciously kicked against in his criticism shows itself here also
and we know perfectly well that the good lines
When the first rose flush was steeping
All the frore peaks awful crown
are but an unconscious reminiscence of the great ones
And on the glimmering summit far withdrawn
God made himself an awful rose of dawn
He kept this level though here following not Tennyson or Keats but
Shelley in the three ambitious and elaborate lyrics The Voice To
Fausta and Stagirius fine things if somehow a little suggestive
of inability on their authors part fully to meet the demands of the
forms he attemptsthe note in short expressed practically as well
as in theory Stagirius in particular wants but a very little to be
a perfect expression of the obstinate questionings of the century and
yet wanting a little it wants so much Others To a Gipsy Child and
The Hayswater Boat Mr Arnold never reprinted this are but faint
Wordsworthian echoes and thus we come to The Forsaken Merman
It is I believe not so correct as it once was to admire this but
I confess indocility to correctness at least the correctness which
varies with fashion The Forsaken Merman is not a perfect poemit
has longueurs though it is not long it has those inadequacies
those incompetences of expression which are so oddly characteristic
of its author and his elaborate simplicity though more at home here
than in some other places occasionally gives a dissonance But it is
a great poemone by itself one which finds and keeps its own place
in the foreordained gallery or museum with which every true lover of
poetry is provided though he inherits it by degrees No one I
suppose will deny its pathos I should be sorry for any one who fails
to perceive its beauty The brief picture of the land and the fuller
one of the sea and that more elaborate still of the occupations of
the fugitive all have their own charm But the triumph of the piece
is in one of those metrical coups which give the triumph of all the
greatest poetry in the sudden change from the slower movements of the
earlier stanzas or strophes to the quicker sweep of the famous
conclusion
The salt tide rolls seaward
Lights shine from the town
to
She left lonely for ever
The kings of the sea
Here the poets poetry has come to its own
In Utrumque Paratus sounds the note again and has one exceedingly
fine stanza
Thin thin the pleasant human noises grow
And faint the city gleams
Rare the lone pastoral hutsmarvel not thou
The solemn peaks but to the stars are known
But to the stars and the cold lunar beams
Alone the sun arises and alone
Spring the great streams
But Resignation the last poem in the book goes far higher Again
it is too long and as is not the case in the Merman or even in
The Strayed Reveller itself the general drift of the poem the
allegory if it be an allegory of the two treadings of the selfsame
road with Fausta and so forth is unnecessarily obscure and does not
tempt one to spend much trouble in penetrating its obscurity But the
splendid passage beginning
The Poet to whose mighty heart
and ending
His sad lucidity of soul
has far more interest than concerns the mere introduction in this
last line itself of one of the famous Arnoldian catchwords of later
years It has far more than lies even in its repetition with fuller
detail of what has been called the authors main poetic note of
halfmelancholy contemplation of life It has once more the interest
of poetryof poetical presentation which is independent of any
subject or intention which is capable of being adapted perhaps to
