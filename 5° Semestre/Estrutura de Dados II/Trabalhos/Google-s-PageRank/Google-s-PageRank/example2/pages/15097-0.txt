To these may be added certain combinations of letters universally used in
printing as fl ff fi ffi ffl and  or and per se and
Our letters are commonly reckoned twentyfour because anciently i and
j as well as u and v were expressed by the same character but as those
letters which had always different powers have now different forms
our alphabet may be properly said to consist of twentysix letters
Vowels are five a e i o u
Such is the number generally received but for i it is the practice to
write y in the end of words as thy holy before i as from die dying
from beautify beautifying in the words says days eyes and in words
For u we often write w after a vowel to make a diphthong as raw grew
view vow flowing lowness
The sounds of all the letters are various
In treating on the letters I shall not like some other grammarians
inquire into the original of their form as an antiquarian nor into
their formation and prolation by the organs of speech as a mechanick
anatomist or physiologist nor into the properties and gradation of
sounds or the elegance or harshness of particular combinations as a
writer of universal and transcendental grammar I consider the English
alphabet only as it is English and even in this narrow disquisition I
follow the example of former grammarians perhaps with more reverence
than judgment because by writing in English I suppose my reader
already acquainted with the English language and consequently able to
pronounce the letters of which I teach the pronunciation and because
of sounds in general it may be observed that words are unable to
describe them An account therefore of the primitive and simple
letters is useless almost alike to those who know their sound and
those who know it not
OF VOWELS
A
A has three sounds the slender open and broad
A slender is found in most words as face mane and in words ending in
ation as creation salvation generation
The a slender is the proper English a called very justly by Erpenius
in his Arabick Grammar a Anglicum cum e mistum as having a middle
sound between the open a and the e The French have a similar sound in
the word pais and in their e masculine
A open is the a of the Italian or nearly resembles it as father rather
congratulate fancy glass
A broad resembles the a of the German as all wall call
Many words pronounced with a broad were anciently written with au as
sault mault and we still say fault vault This was probably the
Saxon sound for it is yet retained in the northern dialects and in
the rustick pronunciation as maun for man haund for hand
The short a approaches to the a open as grass
The long a if prolonged by e at the end of the word is always slender as
graze fame
A forms a diphthong only with i or y and u or w Ai or ay as in plain
wain gay clay has only the sound of the long and slender a and differs
not in the pronunciation from plane wane
Au or aw has the sound of the German a as raw naughty
Ae is sometimes found in Latin words not completely naturalized or
assimilated but is no English diphthong and is more properly
expressed by single e as Cesar Eneas
E
E is the letter which occurs most frequently in the English language
E is long as in scAne or short as in cAllar sAparate cAlebrate mAn
thAn
It is always short before a double consonant or two consonants as in vAx
pArplexity relAnt mAdlar rAptile sArpent cAllar cAssation blAssing
fAll fAlling dAbt
E is always mute at the end of a word except in monosyllables that have no
other vowel as the or proper names as Penelope Phebe Derbe being used
to modify the foregoing consonants as since once hedge oblige or to
lengthen the preceding vowel as bAn bAne cAn cAne pAn pAne tAn
tAne rAb rAbe pAp pApe fAr fAre cAr cAre tAb tAbe
Almost all words which now terminate in consonants ended anciently in
e as year yeare wildness wildnesse which e probably had the force
of the French e feminine and constituted a syllable with its associate
consonant for in old editions words are sometimes divided thus
cleare felle knowledge This e was perhaps for a time vocal or
silent in poetry as convenience required but it has been long wholly
mute Camden in his Remains calls it the silent e
It does not always lengthen the foregoing vowel as glAve lAve gAve
It has sometimes in the end of words a sound obscure and scarcely
perceptible as open shapen shotten thistle participle metre lucre
This faintness of sound is found when e separates a mute from a liquid
as in rotten or follows a mute and liquid as in cattle
E forms a diphthong with a as near with i as deign receive and with u
or w as new stew
Ea sounds like e long as mean or like ee as dear clear near
Ei is sounded like e long as seize perceiving
Eu sounds as u long and soft
E a u are combined in beauty and its derivatives but have only the
sound of u
E may be said to form a diphthong by reduplication as agree sleeping
Eo is found in yeoman where it is sounded as o short and in people
where it is pronounced like ee
I
I has a sound long as fAne and short as fAn
That is eminently observable in i which may be likewise remarkable in
other letters that the short sound is not the long sound contracted
but a sound wholly different
The long sound in monosyllables is always marked by the e final as thAn
thAne
I is often sounded before r as a short u as flirt first shirt
It forms a diphthong only with e as field shield which is sounded as the
double ee except friend which is sounded as frAnd
I is joined with eu in lieu and ew in view which triphthongs are
sounded as the open u
O
O is long as bAne Abedient corrAding or short as blAck knAck
Ablique lAll
Women is pronounced wimen
The short o has sometimes the sound of close u as son come
O coalesces into a diphthong with a as moan groan approach oa has the
sound of o long
O is united to e in some words derived from Greek as Aconomy but as
being not an English diphthong they are better written as they are
sounded with only e economy
With i as oil soil moil noisome
This coalition of letters seems to unite the sounds of the two letters
as far as two sounds can be united without being destroyed and
therefore approaches more nearly than any combination in our tongue to
the notion of a diphthong
With o as boot hoot cooler oo has the sound of the Italian u
With u or w as our power flower but in some words has only the sound of
o long as in soul bowl sow grow These different sounds are used to
distinguish different significations as bow an instrument for shooting
bow a depression of the head sow the she of a boar sow to scatter
seed bowl an orbicular body bowl a wooden vessel
Ou is sometimes pronounced like o soft as court sometimes like o short
as cough sometimes like u close as could or u open as rough tough
which use only can teach
Ou is frequently used in the last syllable of words which in Latin end
in or and are made English as honour labour favour from honor
labor favor
Some late innovators have ejected the u without considering that the
last syllable gives the sound neither of or nor ur but a sound between
them if not compounded of both besides that they are probably derived
to us from the French nouns in eur as honeur faveur
U
U is long in Ase confAsion or short as As concAssion
It coalesces with a e i o but has rather in these combinations the
force of the w consonant as quaff quest quit quite languish sometimes
in ui the i loses its sound as in juice It is sometimes mute before a e
i y as guard guest guise buy
U is followed by e in virtue but the e has no sound
Ue is sometimes mute at the end of a word in imitation of the French
as prorogue synagogue plague vague harangue
Y
Y is a vowel which as Quintilian observes of one of the Roman letters we
might want without inconvenience but that we have it It supplies the
place of i at the end of words as thy before an i as dying and is
commonly retained in derivative words where it was part of a diphthong in
the primitive as destroy destroyer betray betrayed betrayer pray
prayer say sayer day days
Y being the Saxon vowel y which was commonly used where i is now put
occurs very frequently in all old books
GENERAL RULES
A vowel in the beginning or middle syllable before two consonants is
commonly short as AppArtunity
In monosyllables a single vowel before a single consonant is short as
stag frog
Many is pronounced as if it were written manny
OF CONSONANTS
B
B has one unvaried sound such as it obtains in other languages
It is mute in debt debtor subtle doubt lamb limb dumb thumb climb
comb womb
It is used before l and r as black brown
C
C has before e and i the sound of s as sincerely centrick century
circular cistern city siccity before a o and u it sounds like k as
calm concavity copper incorporate curiosity concupiscence
C might be omitted in the language without loss since one of its
sounds might be supplied by s and the other by k but that it
preserves to the eye the etymology of words as face from facies
captive from captivus
Ch has a sound which is analyzed into tsh as church chin crutch It is
the same sound which the Italians give to the c simple before i and e as
citta cerro
Ch is sounded like k in words derived from the Greek as chymist scheme
choler Arch is commonly sounded ark before a vowel as archangel and with
the English sound of ch before a consonant as archbishop
Ch in some French words not yet assimilated sounds like sh as
machine chaise
C according to English orthography never ends a word therefore we
write stick block which were originally sticke blocke In such
words c is now mute
It is used before l and r as clock cross
D
Is uniform in its sound as death diligent
It is used before r as draw dross and w as dwell
F
F though having a name beginning with a vowel is numbered by the
grammarians among the semivowels yet has this quality of a mute that it
is commodiously sounded before a liquid as flask fry freckle It has an
unvariable sound except that of is sometimes spoken nearly as ov
G
G has two sounds one hard as in gay go gun the other soft as in gem
giant
At the end of a word it is always hard as ring snug song frog
Before e and i the sound is uncertain
G before e is soft as gem generation except in gear geld geese get
gewgaw and derivatives from words ending in g as singing stronger and
generally before er at the ends of words as finger
G is mute before n as gnash sign foreign
G before i is hard as give except in giant gigantick gibbet gibe
giblets Giles gill gilliflower gin ginger gingle to which may be
added Egypt and gypsy
Gh in the beginning of a word has the sound of the hard g as ghostly in
the middle and sometimes at the end it is quite silent as though right
sought spoken tho rite soute
It has often at the end the sound of f as laugh whence laughter retains
the same sound in the middle cough trough sough tough enough slough
It is not to be doubted but that in the original pronunciation gh has
the force of a consonant deeply guttural which is still continued
among the Scotch
G is used before h l and r
H
H is a note of aspiration and shows that the following vowel must be
pronounced with a strong emission of breath as hat horse
It seldom begins any but the first syllable in which it is always sounded
with a full breath except in heir herb hostler honour humble honest
humour and their derivatives
It sometimes begins middle or final syllables in words compounded as
blockhead or derived from the Latin as comprehend
J
J consonant sounds uniformly like the soft g and is therefore a letter
useless except in etymology as ejaculation jester jocund juice
K
K has the sound of hard c and is used before e and i where according to
English analogy c would be soft as kept king skirt skeptick for so it
should be written not sceptick because sc is sounded like s as in scene
It is used before n as knell knot but totally loses its sound in
modern pronunciation
K is never doubled but c is used before it to shorten the vowel by a
double consonant as cockle pickle
L
L has in English the same liquid sound as in other languages
The custom is to double the l at the end of monosyllables as kill
will full These words were originally written kille wille fulle
and when the e first grew silent and was afterward omitted the ll was
retained to give force according to the analogy of our language to
the foregoing vowel
L is sometimes mute as in calf half halves calves could would
should psalm talk salmon falcon
The Saxons who delighted in guttural sounds sometimes aspirated the l
at the beginning of words as hlaf a loaf or bread hlaford a lord
but this pronunciation is now disused
Le at the end of words is pronounced like a weak el in which the e is
almost mute as table shuttle
M
M has always the same sound as murmur monumental
N
N has always the same sound as noble manners
N is sometimes mute after m as damn condemn hymn
P
P has always the same sound which the Welsh and Germans confound with b
P is sometimes mute as in psalm and between m and t as tempt
Ph is used for f in words derived from the Greek as philosopher
philanthropy Philip
Q
Q as in other languages is always followed by u and has a sound which
our Saxon ancestors well expressed by cw as quadrant queen equestrian
quilt inquiry quire quotidian Qu is never followed by u
Qu is sometimes sounded in words derived from the French like k as
conquer liquor risque chequer
R
R has the same rough snarling sound as in the other tongues
The Saxons used often to put h before it as before l at the beginning
of words
Rh is used in words derived from the Greek as myrrh myrrhine
catarrhous rheum rheumatick rhyme
Re at the end of some words derived from the Latin or French is
pronounced like a weak er as theatre sepulchre
S
S has a hissing sound as sibilation sister
A single s seldom ends any word except in the third person of verbs
as loves grows and the plurals of nouns as trees bushes
distresses the pronouns this his ours yours us the adverb thus
and words derived from Latin as rebus surplus the close being always
either in se as house horse or in ss as grass dress bliss less
anciently grasse dresse
S single at the end of words has a grosser sound like that of z as
trees eyes except this thus us rebus surplus
It sounds like z before ion if a vowel goes before it as intrusion and
like s if it follows a consonant as conversion
It sounds like z before e mute as refuse and before y final as rosy and
in those words bosom desire wisdom prison prisoner present present
damsel casement
It is the peculiar quality of s that it may be sounded before all
consonants except x and z in which s is comprised x being only ks
and z a hard or gross s This s is therefore termed by grammarians suA
potestatis litera the reason of which the learned Dr Clarke
erroneously supposed to be that in some words it might be doubled at
pleasure Thus we find in several languages
sgranare shake slumber smell snipe space splendour spring squeeze
shrew step strength stramen stripe sventura swell
S is mute in isle island demesne viscount
T
T has its customary sound as take temptation
Ti before a vowel has the sound of si as salvation except an s goes
before as question excepting likewise derivatives from words ending in
ty as mighty mightier
Th has two sounds the one soft as thus whether the other hard as
thing think The sound is soft in these words then thence and there
with their derivatives and compounds and in that these thou thee thy
thine their they this those them though thus and in all words
between two vowels as father whether and between r and a vowel as
burthen
In other words it is hard as thick thunder faith faithful Where it is
softened at the end of a word an e silent must be added as breath
breathe cloth clothe
V
V has a sound of near affinity to that of f as vain vanity
From f in the Islandick alphabet v is only distinguished by a
diacritical point
W
Of w which in diphthongs is often an undoubted vowel some grammarians
have doubted whether it ever be a consonant and not rather as it is called
a double u or ou as water may be resolved into ouater but letters of the
same sound are always reckoned consonants in other alphabets and it may be
observed that w follows a vowel without any hiatus or difficulty of
utterance as frosty winter
Wh has a sound accounted peculiar to the English which the Saxons better
expressed by hw as what whence whiting in whore only and sometimes in
wholesome wh is sounded like a simple h
X
X begins no English word it has the sound of ks as axle extraneous
Y
Y when it follows a consonant is a vowel when it precedes either a vowel
or a diphthong is a consonant as ye young It is thought by some to be
in all cases a vowel But it may be observed of y as of w that it follows
a vowel without any hiatus as rosy youth
The chief argument by which w and y appear to be always vowels is that
the sounds which they are supposed to have as consonants cannot be
uttered after a vowel like that of all other consonants thus we say
tu ut do odd but in wed dew the two sounds of w have no
resemblance to each other
Z
Z begins no word originally English it has the sound as its name izzard
or s hard expresses of an s uttered with a closer compression of the
palate by the tongue as freeze froze
In orthography I have supposed orthoepy or just utterance of words to
be included orthography being only the art of expressing certain
sounds by proper characters I have therefore observed in what words
any of the letters are mute
Most of the writers of English grammar have given long tables of words
pronounced otherwise than they are written and seem not sufficiently
to have considered that of English as of all living tongues there is
a double pronunciation one cursory and colloquial the other regular
and solemn The cursory pronunciation is always vague and uncertain
being made different in different mouths by negligence unskilfulness
or affectation The solemn pronunciation though by no means immutable
and permanent is yet always less remote from the orthography and less
liable to capricious innovation They have however generally formed
their tables according to the cursory speech of those with whom they
happened to converse and concluding that the whole nation combines to
vitiate language in one manner have often established the jargon of
the lowest of the people as the model of speech
For pronunciation the best general rule is to consider those as the
most elegant speakers who deviate least from the written words
There have been many schemes offered for the emendation and settlement
of our orthography which like that of other nations being formed by
chance or according to the fancy of the earliest writers in rude ages
was at first very various and uncertain and is yet sufficiently
irregular Of these reformers some have endeavoured to accommodate
orthography better to the pronunciation without considering that this
is to measure by a shadow to take that for a model or standard which
is changing while they apply it Others less absurdly indeed but with
equal unlikelihood of success have endeavoured to proportion the
number of letters to that of sounds that every sound may have its own
character and every character a single sound Such would be the
orthography of a new language to be formed by a synod of grammarians
upon principles of science But who can hope to prevail on nations to
change their practice and make all their old books useless or what
advantage would a new orthography procure equivalent to the confusion
and perplexity of such an alteration
Some ingenious men indeed have endeavoured to deserve well of their
country by writing honor and labor for honour and labour red for read
in the pretertense sais for says repete tor repeat explane for
explain or declame for declaim Of these it may be said that as they
have done no good they have done little harm both because they have
innovated little and because few have followed them
The English language has properly no dialects the style of writers has
no professed diversity in the use of words or of their flexions and
terminations nor differs but by different degrees of skill or care
The oral diction is uniform in no spacious country but has less
variation in England than in most other nations of equal extent The
language of the northern counties retains many words now out of use
but which are commonly of the genuine Teutonick race and is uttered
with a pronunciation which now seems harsh and rough but was probably
used by our ancestors The northern speech is therefore not barbarous
but obsolete The speech in the western provinces seems to differ from
the general diction rather by a depraved pronunciation than by any
real difference which letters would express
ETYMOLOGY
Etymology teaches the deduction of one word from another and the various
modifications by which the sense of the same word is diversified as horse
horses I love I loved
Of the ARTICLE
The English have two articles an or a and the
AN A
A has an indefinite signification and means one with some reference to
more as This is a good book that is one among the books that are good
He was killed by a sword that is some sword This is a better book for a
man than a boy that is for one of those that are men than one of those
that are boys An army might enter without resistance that is any army
In the senses in which we use a or an in the singular we speak in the
plural without an article as these are good books
I have made an the original article because it is only the Saxon an
or An one applied to a new use as the German ein and the French un
the n being cut off before a consonant in the speed of utterance
Grammarians of the last age direct that an should be used before h whence
it appears that the English anciently asperated less An is still used
before the silent h as an herb an honest man but otherwise a as
A horse a horse my kingdom for a horse       Shakespeare
An or a can only be joined with a singular the correspondent plural is the
noun without an article as I want a pen I want pens or with the
pronominal adjective some as I want some pens
THE
The has a particular and definite signification
The fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world       Milton
That is that particular fruit and this world in which we live So He
giveth fodder for the cattle and green herbs for the use of man that is
for those beings that are cattle and his use that is man
The is used in both numbers
I am as free as Nature first made man
Ere the base laws of servitude began
When wild in woods the noble savage ran       Dryden
Many words are used without articles as
1 Proper names as John Alexander Longinus Aristarchus Jerusalem
Athens Rome London GOD is used as a proper name
2 Abstract names as blackness witchcraft virtue vice beauty
ugliness love hatred anger goodnature kindness
3 Words in which nothing but the mere being of any thing is implied This
is not beer but water this is not brass but steel
Of NOUNS SUBSTANTIVE
The relations of English nouns to words going before or following are not
expressed by cases or changes of termination but as in most of the other
European languages by prepositions unless we may be said to have a
genitive case
Singular
Nom Magister        a Master the Master
Gen Magistri        of a Master of the Master
or Masters the Masters
Dat Magistro        to a Master to the Master
Acc Magistrum       a Master the Master
Voc Magister        Master O Master
Abl Magistro        from a Master from the Master
Plural
Nom Magistri        Masters the Masters
Gen Magistrorum     of Masters of the Masters
Dat Magistris       to Masters to the Masters
Acc Magistros       Masters the Masters
Voc Magistri        Masters O Masters
Abl Magistris       from Masters from the Masters
Our nouns are therefore only declined thus
Master     Gen Masters        Plur Masters
Scholar    Gen Scholars       Plur Scholars
These genitives are always written with a mark of elision masters
scholars according to an opinion long received that the s is a
contraction of his as the soldiers valour for the soldier his
valour but this cannot be the true original because s is put to
female nouns Womans beauty the Virgins delicacy Haughty Junos
unrelenting hate and collective nouns as Womens passions the
rabbles insolence the multitudes folly in all these cases it is
apparent that his cannot be understood We say likewise the
foundations strength the diamonds lustre the winters severity but
in these cases his may be understood he and his having formerly been
applied to neuters in the place now supplied by it and its
The learned and sagacious Wallis to whom every English grammarian owes
a tribute of reverence calls this modification of the noun an
adjective possessive I think with no more propriety than he might have
applied the same to the genitive in equitum decus TrojA oris or any
other Latin genitive Dr Lowth on the other part supposes the
possessive pronouns mine and thine to be genitive cases
This termination of the noun seems to constitute a real genitive
indicating possession It is derived to us from the Saxons who
declined smith a smith Gen smither of a smith Plur smither or
smithar smiths and so in two other of their seven declensions
It is a further confirmation of this opinion that in the old poets
both the genitive and plural were longer by a syllable than the
original word knitis for knights in Chaucer leavis for leaves in
Spenser
