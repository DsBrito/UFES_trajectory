native to him as it is to a wild stag In addition his face was almost
without flawa good face as well as a beautiful one and when he lifted
his hat which he did just then to a passing lady I saw that his head
was covered with little golden curls growing close to the scalp
Good gracious I said to my friend with whom I was walking why
that fellow looks like a statue of Apollo come to life What a splendid
man he is
Yes he answered he is the handsomest man in the University and one
of the nicest too They call him the Greek god but look at the other
one hes Vinceys thats the gods name guardian and supposed to be
full of every kind of information They call him Charon I looked
and found the older man quite as interesting in his way as the glorified
specimen of humanity at his side He appeared to be about forty years
of age and was I think as ugly as his companion was handsome To begin
with he was shortish rather bowlegged very deep chested and with
unusually long arms He had dark hair and small eyes and the hair grew
right down on his forehead and his whiskers grew right up to his hair
so that there was uncommonly little of his countenance to be seen
Altogether he reminded me forcibly of a gorilla and yet there was
something very pleasing and genial about the mans eye I remember
saying that I should like to know him
All right answered my friend nothing easier I know Vincey
Ill introduce you and he did and for some minutes we stood
chattingabout the Zulu people I think for I had just returned from
the Cape at the time Presently however a stoutish lady whose name
I do not remember came along the pavement accompanied by a pretty
fairhaired girl and these two Mr Vincey who clearly knew them well
at once joined walking off in their company I remember being rather
amused because of the change in the expression of the elder man whose
name I discovered was Holly when he saw the ladies advancing He
suddenly stopped short in his talk cast a reproachful look at his
companion and with an abrupt nod to myself turned and marched off
alone across the street I heard afterwards that he was popularly
supposed to be as much afraid of a woman as most people are of a mad
dog which accounted for his precipitate retreat I cannot say however
that young Vincey showed much aversion to feminine society on this
occasion Indeed I remember laughing and remarking to my friend at
the time that he was not the sort of man whom it would be desirable to
introduce to the lady one was going to marry since it was exceedingly
probable that the acquaintance would end in a transfer of her
affections He was altogether too goodlooking and what is more
he had none of that consciousness and conceit about him which usually
afflicts handsome men and makes them deservedly disliked by their
fellows
That same evening my visit came to an end and this was the last I saw
or heard of Charon and the Greek god for many a long day Indeed I
have never seen either of them from that hour to this and do not think
it probable that I shall But a month ago I received a letter and two
packets one of manuscript and on opening the first found that it was
signed by Horace Holly a name that at the moment was not familiar to
me It ran as follows
College Cambridge May 1 18
My dear SirYou will be surprised considering the very slight nature
of our acquaintance to get a letter from me Indeed I think I had
better begin by reminding you that we once met now some five years ago
when I and my ward Leo Vincey were introduced to you in the street at
Cambridge To be brief and come to my business I have recently
read with much interest a book of yours describing a Central African
adventure I take it that this book is partly true and partly an effort
of the imagination However this may be it has given me an idea It
happens how you will see in the accompanying manuscript which together
with the Scarab the Royal Son of the Sun and the original sherd I
am sending to you by hand that my ward or rather my adopted son Leo
Vincey and myself have recently passed through a real African adventure
of a nature so much more marvellous than the one which you describe
that to tell the truth I am almost ashamed to submit it to you lest you
should disbelieve my tale You will see it stated in this manuscript
that I or rather we had made up our minds not to make this history
public during our joint lives Nor should we alter our determination
were it not for a circumstance which has recently arisen We are for
reasons that after perusing this manuscript you may be able to guess
going away again this time to Central Asia where if anywhere upon this
earth wisdom is to be found and we anticipate that our sojourn there
will be a long one Possibly we shall not return Under these altered
conditions it has become a question whether we are justified in
withholding from the world an account of a phenomenon which we believe
to be of unparalleled interest merely because our private life is
involved or because we are afraid of ridicule and doubt being cast
upon our statements I hold one view about this matter and Leo
holds another and finally after much discussion we have come to a
compromise namely to send the history to you giving you full leave to
publish it if you think fit the only stipulation being that you shall
disguise our real names and as much concerning our personal identity as
is consistent with the maintenance of the bona fides of the narrative
And now what am I to say further I really do not know beyond once more
repeating that everything is described in the accompanying manuscript
exactly as it happened As regards She herself I have nothing to add
Day by day we gave greater occasion to regret that we did not better
avail ourselves of our opportunities to obtain more information from
that marvellous woman Who was she How did she first come to the Caves
of KA r and what was her real religion We never ascertained and now
alas we never shall at least not yet These and many other questions
arise in my mind but what is the good of asking them now
Will you undertake the task We give you complete freedom and as a
reward you will we believe have the credit of presenting to the world
the most wonderful history as distinguished from romance that its
records can show Read the manuscript which I have copied out fairly
for your benefit and let me know
Believe me very truly yours L Horace Holly
PSOf course if any profit results from the sale of the writing
should you care to undertake its publication you can do what you
like with it but if there is a loss I will leave instructions with my
lawyers Messrs Geoffrey and Jordan to meet it We entrust the sherd
the scarab and the parchments to your keeping till such time as we
demand them back again L H H
This name is varied throughout in accordance with the
writers requestEditor
This letter as may be imagined astonished me considerably but when I
came to look at the MS which the pressure of other work prevented me
from doing for a fortnight I was still more astonished as I think the
reader will be also and at once made up my mind to press on with the
matter I wrote to this effect to Mr Holly but a week afterwards
received a letter from that gentlemans lawyers returning my own with
the information that their client and Mr Leo Vincey had already left
this country for Thibet and they did not at present know their address
Well that is all I have to say Of the history itself the reader must
judge I give it him with the exception of a very few alterations
made with the object of concealing the identity of the actors from the
general public exactly as it came to me Personally I have made up my
mind to refrain from comments At first I was inclined to believe that
this history of a woman on whom clothed in the majesty of her almost
endless years the shadow of Eternity itself lay like the dark wing
of Night was some gigantic allegory of which I could not catch the
meaning Then I thought that it might be a bold attempt to portray the
possible results of practical immortality informing the substance of
a mortal who yet drew her strength from Earth and in whose human bosom
passions yet rose and fell and beat as in the undying world around her
the winds and the tides rise and fall and beat unceasingly But as I
went on I abandoned that idea also To me the story seems to bear the
stamp of truth upon its face Its explanation I must leave to others
and with this slight preface which circumstances make necessary I
introduce the world to Ayesha and the Caves of KA rThe Editor
PSThere is on consideration one circumstance that after a reperusal
of this history struck me with so much force that I cannot resist
calling the attention of the reader to it He will observe that so far
as we are made acquainted with him there appears to be nothing in the
character of Leo Vincey which in the opinion of most people would have
been likely to attract an intellect so powerful as that of Ayesha He is
not even at any rate to my view particularly interesting Indeed one
might imagine that Mr Holly would under ordinary circumstances have
easily outstripped him in the favour of She Can it be that extremes
meet and that the very excess and splendour of her mind led her by
means of some strange physical reaction to worship at the shrine of
matter Was that ancient Kallikrates nothing but a splendid animal
loved for his hereditary Greek beauty Or is the true explanation what
I believe it to benamely that Ayesha seeing further than we can
see perceived the germ and smouldering spark of greatness which lay hid
within her lovers soul and well knew that under the influence of her
gift of life watered by her wisdom and shone upon with the sunshine
of her presence it would bloom like a flower and flash out like a star
filling the world with light and fragrance
Here also I am not able to answer but must leave the reader to form his
own judgment on the facts before him as detailed by Mr Holly in the
following pages
I
MY VISITOR
There are some events of which each circumstance and surrounding detail
seems to be graven on the memory in such fashion that we cannot forget
it and so it is with the scene that I am about to describe It rises
as clearly before my mind at this moment as thought it had happened but
yesterday
It was in this very month something over twenty years ago that I Ludwig
Horace Holly was sitting one night in my rooms at Cambridge grinding
away at some mathematical work I forget what I was to go up for my
fellowship within a week and was expected by my tutor and my college
generally to distinguish myself At last wearied out I flung my book
down and going to the mantelpiece took down a pipe and filled it
There was a candle burning on the mantelpiece and a long narrow glass
at the back of it and as I was in the act of lighting the pipe I caught
sight of my own countenance in the glass and paused to reflect The
lighted match burnt away till it scorched my fingers forcing me to drop
it but still I stood and stared at myself in the glass and reflected
Well I said aloud at last it is to be hoped that I shall be able
to do something with the inside of my head for I shall certainly never
do anything by the help of the outside
This remark will doubtless strike anybody who reads it as being slightly
obscure but I was in reality alluding to my physical deficiencies
Most men of twentytwo are endowed at any rate with some share of the
comeliness of youth but to me even this was denied Short thickset
and deepchested almost to deformity with long sinewy arms heavy
features deepset grey eyes a low brow half overgrown with a mop of
thick black hair like a deserted clearing on which the forest had once
more begun to encroach such was my appearance nearly a quarter of a
century ago and such with some modification it is to this day
Like Cain I was brandedbranded by Nature with the stamp of abnormal
ugliness as I was gifted by Nature with iron and abnormal strength and
considerable intellectual powers So ugly was I that the spruce
young men of my College though they were proud enough of my feats of
endurance and physical prowess did not even care to be seen walking
with me Was it wonderful that I was misanthropic and sullen Was it
wonderful that I brooded and worked alone and had no friendsat least
only one I was set apart by Nature to live alone and draw comfort
from her breast and hers only Women hated the sight of me Only a week
before I had heard one call me a monster when she thought I was out
of hearing and say that I had converted her to the monkey theory Once
indeed a woman pretended to care for me and I lavished all the pentup
affection of my nature upon her Then money that was to have come to me
went elsewhere and she discarded me I pleaded with her as I have never
pleaded with any living creature before or since for I was caught by
her sweet face and loved her and in the end by way of answer she took
me to the glass and stood side by side with me and looked into it
Now she said if I am Beauty who are you That was when I was only
twenty
And so I stood and stared and felt a sort of grim satisfaction in the
sense of my own loneliness for I had neither father nor mother nor
brother and as I did so there came a knock at my door
I listened before I went to open it for it was nearly twelve oclock at
night and I was in no mood to admit any stranger I had but one friend
in the College or indeed in the worldperhaps it was he
Just then the person outside the door coughed and I hastened to open
it for I knew the cough
A tall man of about thirty with the remains of great personal beauty
came hurrying in staggering beneath the weight of a massive iron box
which he carried by a handle with his right hand He placed the box upon
the table and then fell into an awful fit of coughing He coughed and
coughed till his face became quite purple and at last he sank into
a chair and began to spit up blood I poured out some whisky into a
tumbler and gave it to him He drank it and seemed better though his
better was very bad indeed
Why did you keep me standing there in the cold he asked pettishly
You know the draughts are death to me
I did not know who it was I answered You are a late visitor
Yes and I verily believe it is my last visit he answered with a
ghastly attempt at a smile I am done for Holly I am done for I do
not believe that I shall see tomorrow
Nonsense I said Let me go for a doctor
He waved me back imperiously with his hand It is sober sense but I
want no doctors I have studied medicine and I know all about it No
doctors can help me My last hour has come For a year past I have
only lived by a miracle Now listen to me as you have never listened to
anybody before for you will not have the opportunity of getting me to
repeat my words We have been friends for two years now tell me how
much do you know about me
I know that you are rich and have had a fancy to come to College long
after the age that most men leave it I know that you have been married
and that your wife died and that you have been the best indeed almost
the only friend I ever had
Did you know that I have a son
No
I have He is five years old He cost me his mothers life and I have
never been able to bear to look upon his face in consequence Holly
if you will accept the trust I am going to leave you that boys sole
guardian
I sprang almost out of my chair Me I said
Yes you I have not studied you for two years for nothing I have
known for some time that I could not last and since I realised the fact
I have been searching for some one to whom I could confide the boy and
this and he tapped the iron box You are the man Holly for like a
rugged tree you are hard and sound at core Listen the boy will be the
only representative of one of the most ancient families in the world
that is so far as families can be traced You will laugh at me when
I say it but one day it will be proved to you beyond a doubt that my
sixtyfifth or sixtysixth lineal ancestor was an Egyptian priest
of Isis though he was himself of Grecian extraction and was called
Kallikrates His father was one of the Greek mercenaries raised
by HakHor a Mendesian Pharaoh of the twentyninth dynasty and his
grandfather or greatgrandfather I believe was that very Kallikrates
mentioned by Herodotus In or about the year 339 before Christ just
at the time of the final fall of the Pharaohs this Kallikrates the
priest broke his vows of celibacy and fled from Egypt with a Princess
of Royal blood who had fallen in love with him and was finally wrecked
upon the coast of Africa somewhere as I believe in the neighbourhood
of where Delagoa Bay now is or rather to the north of it he and his
wife being saved and all the remainder of their company destroyed in
one way or another Here they endured great hardships but were at last
entertained by the mighty Queen of a savage people a white woman of
peculiar loveliness who under circumstances which I cannot enter into
but which you will one day learn if you live from the contents of
the box finally murdered my ancestor Kallikrates His wife however
escaped how I know not to Athens bearing a child with her whom she
named Tisisthenes or the Mighty Avenger Five hundred years or more
afterwards the family migrated to Rome under circumstances of which no
trace remains and here probably with the idea of preserving the idea
of vengeance which we find set out in the name of Tisisthenes they
appear to have pretty regularly assumed the cognomen of Vindex or
Avenger Here too they remained for another five centuries or more
till about 770 AD when Charlemagne invaded Lombardy where they were
then settled whereon the head of the family seems to have attached
himself to the great Emperor and to have returned with him across the
Alps and finally to have settled in Brittany Eight generations later
his lineal representative crossed to England in the reign of Edward
the Confessor and in the time of William the Conqueror was advanced to
great honour and power From that time to the present day I can trace
my descent without a break Not that the Vinceysfor that was the final
corruption of the name after its bearers took root in English soilhave
been particularly distinguishedthey never came much to the fore
Sometimes they were soldiers sometimes merchants but on the whole they
have preserved a dead level of respectability and a still deader level
of mediocrity From the time of Charles II till the beginning of the
present century they were merchants About 1790 by grandfather made a
considerable fortune out of brewing and retired In 1821 he died and
my father succeeded him and dissipated most of the money Ten years ago
he died also leaving me a net income of about two thousand a year Then
it was that I undertook an expedition in connection with that and he
pointed to the iron chest which ended disastrously enough On my way
back I travelled in the South of Europe and finally reached Athens
There I met my beloved wife who might well also have been called the
Beautiful like my old Greek ancestor There I married her and there
a year afterwards when my boy was born she died
The Strong and Beautiful or more accurately the
Beautiful in strength
The Kallikrates here referred to by my friend was a
Spartan spoken of by Herodotus Herod ix 72 as being
remarkable for his beauty He fell at the glorious battle of
PlatAa September 22 BC 479 when the LacedAmonians
and Athenians under Pausanias routed the Persians putting
nearly 300000 of them to the sword The following is a
translation of the passage For Kallikrates died out of the
battle he came to the army the most beautiful man of the
Greeks of that daynot only of the LacedAmonians
themselves but of the other Greeks also He when Pausanias
was sacrificing was wounded in the side by an arrow and
then they fought but on being carried off he regretted his
death and said to Arimnestus a PlatAan that he did not
grieve at dying for Greece but at not having struck a blow
or although he desired so to do performed any deed worthy
of himself This Kallikrates who appears to have been as
brave as he was beautiful is subsequently mentioned by
Herodotus as having been buried among the a14Ia123I12II
young commanders apart from the other Spartans and the
HelotsL H H
He paused a while his head sunk upon his hand and then continued
My marriage had diverted me from a project which I cannot enter into
now I have no time HollyI have no time One day if you accept my
trust you will learn all about it After my wifes death I turned my
mind to it again But first it was necessary or at least I conceived
that it was necessary that I should attain to a perfect knowledge of
Eastern dialects especially Arabic It was to facilitate my studies
that I came here Very soon however my disease developed itself and
now there is an end of me And as though to emphasise his words he
burst into another terrible fit of coughing
I gave him some more whisky and after resting he went on
I have never seen my boy Leo since he was a tiny baby I never could
bear to see him but they tell me that he is a quick and handsome child
In this envelope and he produced a letter from his pocket addressed
to myself I have jotted down the course I wish followed in the boys
education It is a somewhat peculiar one At any rate I could not
entrust it to a stranger Once more will you undertake it
I must first know what I am to undertake I answered
You are to undertake to have the boy Leo to live with you till he is
twentyfive years of agenot to send him to school remember On his
twentyfifth birthday your guardianship will end and you will then
with the keys that I give you now and he placed them on the table
open the iron box and let him see and read the contents and say
whether or no he is willing to undertake the quest There is no
obligation on him to do so Now as regards terms My present income is
two thousand two hundred a year Half of that income I have secured
to you by will for life contingently on your undertaking the
guardianshipthat is one thousand a year remuneration to yourself for
you will have to give up your life to it and one hundred a year to
pay for the board of the boy The rest is to accumulate till Leo is
twentyfive so that there may be a sum in hand should he wish to
undertake the quest of which I spoke
And suppose I were to die I asked
Then the boy must become a ward of Chancery and take his chance Only
be careful that the iron chest is passed on to him by your will Listen
Holly dont refuse me Believe me this is to your advantage You are
not fit to mix with the worldit would only embitter you In a few
weeks you will become a Fellow of your College and the income that you
will derive from that combined with what I have left you will enable you
to live a life of learned leisure alternated with the sport of which
you are so fond such as will exactly suit you
He paused and looked at me anxiously but I still hesitated The charge
seemed so very strange
For my sake Holly We have been good friends and I have no time to
make other arrangements
Very well I said I will do it provided there is nothing in this
paper to make me change my mind and I touched the envelope he had put
upon the table by the keys
Thank you Holly thank you There is nothing at all Swear to me by
God that you will be a father to the boy and follow my directions to
the letter
I swear it I answered solemnly
Very well remember that perhaps one day I shall ask for the account of
your oath for though I am dead and forgotten yet I shall live There
is no such thing as death Holly only a change and as you may perhaps
learn in time to come I believe that even that change could under
certain circumstances be indefinitely postponed and again he broke
into one of his dreadful fits of coughing
There he said I must go you have the chest and my will will be
found among my papers under the authority of which the child will be
handed over to you You will be well paid Holly and I know that you
are honest but if you betray my trust by Heaven I will haunt you
I said nothing being indeed too bewildered to speak
He held up the candle and looked at his own face in the glass It had
been a beautiful face but disease had wrecked it Food for the worms
he said Curious to think that in a few hours I shall be stiff and
coldthe journey done the little game played out Ah me Holly life
is not worth the trouble of life except when one is in loveat least
mine has not been but the boy Leos may be if he has the courage and
the faith Goodbye my friend and with a sudden access of tenderness
he flung his arm about me and kissed me on the forehead and then turned
to go
Look here Vincey I said if you are as ill as you think you had
better let me fetch a doctor
No no he said earnestly Promise me that you wont I am going to
die and like a poisoned rat I wish to die alone
I dont believe that you are going to do anything of the sort I
answered He smiled and with the word Remember on his lips was
gone As for myself I sat down and rubbed my eyes wondering if I had
been asleep As this supposition would not bear investigation I gave it
up and began to think that Vincey must have been drinking I knew that
he was and had been very ill but still it seemed impossible that he
could be in such a condition as to be able to know for certain that he
would not outlive the night Had he been so near dissolution surely he
would scarcely have been able to walk and carry a heavy iron box with
him The whole story on reflection seemed to me utterly incredible
for I was not then old enough to be aware how many things happen in
this world that the common sense of the average man would set down as
so improbable as to be absolutely impossible This is a fact that I have
only recently mastered Was it likely that a man would have a son five
years of age whom he had never seen since he was a tiny infant No Was
it likely that he could foretell his own death so accurately No Was
it likely that he could trace his pedigree for more than three
centuries before Christ or that he would suddenly confide the absolute
guardianship of his child and leave half his fortune to a college
friend Most certainly not Clearly Vincey was either drunk or mad That
being so what did it mean and what was in the sealed iron chest
The whole thing baffled and puzzled me to such an extent that at last I
could stand it no longer and determined to sleep over it So I jumped
up and having put the keys and the letter that Vincey had left away
into my despatchbox and stowed the iron chest in a large portmanteau
I turned in and was soon fast asleep
As it seemed to me I had only been asleep for a few minutes when I was
awakened by somebody calling me I sat up and rubbed my eyes it was
broad daylighteight oclock in fact
Why what is the matter with you John I asked of the gyp who waited
on Vincey and myself You look as though you had seen a ghost
Yes sir and so I have he answered leastways Ive seen a corpse
which is worse Ive been in to call Mr Vincey as usual and there he
lies stark and dead
II
THE YEARS ROLL BY
As might be expected poor Vinceys sudden death created a great stir
in the College but as he was known to be very ill and a satisfactory
doctors certificate was forthcoming there was no inquest They were
not so particular about inquests in those days as they are now indeed
they were generally disliked because of the scandal Under all these
circumstances being asked no questions I did not feel called upon to
volunteer any information about our interview on the night of Vinceys
decease beyond saying that he had come into my rooms to see me as he
often did On the day of the funeral a lawyer came down from London and
followed my poor friends remains to the grave and then went back with
his papers and effects except of course the iron chest which had been
left in my keeping For a week after this I heard no more of the matter
and indeed my attention was amply occupied in other ways for I was
up for my Fellowship a fact that had prevented me from attending the
funeral or seeing the lawyer At last however the examination was
over and I came back to my rooms and sank into an easy chair with a
happy consciousness that I had got through it very fairly
Soon however my thoughts relieved of the pressure that had crushed
them into a single groove during the last few days turned to the events
of the night of poor Vinceys death and again I asked myself what it
all meant and wondered if I should hear anything more of the matter
and if I did not what it would be my duty to do with the curious iron
chest I sat there and thought and thought till I began to grow quite
disturbed over the whole occurrence the mysterious midnight visit the
prophecy of death so shortly to be fulfilled the solemn oath that I had
taken and which Vincey had called on me to answer to in another world
than this Had the man committed suicide It looked like it And what
was the quest of which he spoke The circumstances were uncanny so
much so that though I am by no means nervous or apt to be alarmed
at anything that may seem to cross the bounds of the natural I grew
afraid and began to wish I had nothing to do with them How much more
do I wish it now over twenty years afterwards
As I sat and thought there came a knock at the door and a letter in a
big blue envelope was brought in to me I saw at a glance that it was
a lawyers letter and an instinct told me that it was connected with my
trust The letter which I still have runs thus
SirOur client the late M L Vincey Esq who died on the 9th
instant in  College Cambridge has left behind him a Will of which
you will please find copy enclosed and of which we are the executors
Under this Will you will perceive that you take a lifeinterest in about
half of the late Mr Vinceys property now invested in Consols subject
to your acceptance of the guardianship of his only son Leo Vincey at
present an infant aged five Had we not ourselves drawn up the document
in question in obedience to Mr Vinceys clear and precise instructions
both personal and written and had he not then assured us that he had
very good reasons for what he was doing we are bound to tell you that
its provisions seem to us of so unusual a nature that we should have
bound to call the attention of the Court of Chancery to them in order
that such steps might be taken as seemed desirable to it either by
contesting the capacity of the testator or otherwise to safeguard
the interests of the infant As it is knowing that the testator was
a gentleman of the highest intelligence and acumen and that he has
absolutely no relations living to whom he could have confided the
guardianship of the child we do not feel justified in taking this
course
Awaiting such instructions as you please to send us as regards
the delivery of the infant and the payment of the proportion of the
dividends due to you
We remain Sir faithfully yours
Geoffrey and Jordan
Horace L Holly Esq
I put down the letter and ran my eye through the Will which appeared
from its utter unintelligibility to have been drawn on the strictest
legal principles So far as I could discover however it exactly bore
out what my friend Vincey had told me on the night of his death So
it was true after all I must take the boy Suddenly I remembered the
letter which Vincey had left with the chest I fetched and opened it
