flock
Now it happened that one day while David was as usual out in the
fields that a sudden stir of excitement awoke in the little town of
Bethlehem Men gathered round the city gate and with anxious fearful
eyes looked down the long white road that led up from the plain below
And yet there seemed nothing there to make them look so terrified and
anxious Only an old feeble man was slowly climbing up towards the town
He was driving a heifer before him and carrying what looked like a horn
in his hand
Illustration An old feeble man was slowly climbing up towards the
town
But the people whispered together that the old man was none other than
Samuel the prophet of the Lord who carried Gods messages He must be
bringing a message to them and who knew if it was good or evil They
tried with uneasy minds to remember if they had been doing anything
wrong of late as they watched the old man drawing nearer and nearer
Then at last the chief men of the town went out to meet him
Comest thou peaceably they asked anxiously
The old man lifted his head and looked at them kindly as he echoed their
words
Peaceably he answered at once I am come to sacrifice unto the
Lord
A great sigh of relief went up from the people The visit was a mark of
Gods favour and not of His displeasure
It was true indeed that Samuel had come to offer sacrifice but he had
come also on a secret errand about which no man knew but himself God
had bidden him take his horn of oil and anoint one of the sons of Jesse
to be king over His people instead of Saul the present king who had
displeased Him But it was to be done secretly Saul must not hear of
it or his vengeance would be swift
It was in Jesses house that the feast of the sacrifice was prepared
and Samuel ordered that all the sons of the house should pass before him
as they went to attend the sacrifice
The first to come was Eliab Jesses eldest son and when Samuel saw him
he felt sure that this was the man who was to be anointed king He was a
splendid young man tall and strong and handsome looking almost as
kingly as Saul himself
Surely this is he murmured Samuel to himself But Gods answer came
quickly No this was not the man Samuel saw only the outward signs of
strength and beauty but God saw deeper into the heart
So the eldest son passed on and one by one the six brothers followed
all sons that a father might well be proud of But God sent no sign to
show that any of them was the chosen king
Illustration Surely this is he murmured Samuel to himself
Samuel was puzzled What could it mean Then he turned again to Jesse
Are here all thy children he asked
Surprised at the question Jesse suddenly remembered the little lad
his youngest son who was out in the fields tending the sheep Was it
possible that Samuel had any use for him
Send and fetch him ordered Samuel instantly for we will not sit
down till he comes hither
So a messenger was sent in haste to bring David and presently he came
hurrying in and as soon as Samuel saw him he knew his search was ended
He was only a little shepherd lad with the breath of the hills about
him his golden hair tossed by the wind his fair face flushed and his
sunburned hand holding his shepherds crook But there was no doubt that
God had chosen him
Arise and anoint him for this is he said Gods voice in Samuels
heart
Slowly then the old man rose and held the oil aloft and poured it upon
the boys bowed head while the rest of the company looked silently on
They were puzzled to know what it all meant Perhaps the elder brothers
were envious and wondered why this mere child should be singled out for
special favour But no one dared to question Gods messenger
Nothing further happened just then Samuel returned as he had come by
the winding white road and before long his visit was forgotten as the
people settled to their work again
Illustration Saul tries to kill David
Only David out in the fields thought more and more about what had
happened and grew more and more certain that it had been a call from
God to do some special work for Him The wonder of it filled his mind
but it never interfered with his work
There was little time for idle dreaming in the boys life He was as
watchful as ever in his care for his sheep and as courageous as ever in
guarding them from prowling beasts Even in his leisure time he was busy
too and there was not one of the sunny hours of daylight that he
wasted
He loved music and he taught himself to play on the harp practising so
carefully and patiently that his fingers grew most wonderfully skilful
Then he made songs to go to the music some of the most beautiful songs
that ever have been made in all the world Almost every child today
knows his beautiful song about the Good Shepherd The Lord is my
shepherd I shall not want
There was another thing too that he learned to do with the same care
and patient perseverance and that was to use his shepherds sling
There was no boy in all Bethlehem who could shoot as straight as he
could He never missed his mark
It was no great thing perhaps to make music and aim straight but it
was a great thing to do what lay nearest his hand with all his might
Perhaps some day God would make use of his singing or have some work for
a boy who had a quick eye and a sure aim Who could tell
So David learned to do his very best and before very long Gods call
came to him
Illustration Saul sat day after day in his darkened tent
Saul the King of Israel sat day after day in his darkened tent ill and
full of misery No one dared to go near him and his servants whispered
together It is an evil spirit from the Lord that troubles him
Then some one suggested that perhaps music might help to cheer him and
drive the evil spirit from him
Let our lord now command thy servants to seek out a man who is a
cunning player on a harp they said to the king and it shall come to
pass that when the evil spirit from God is upon thee he shall play
with his hand and thou shalt be well
Illustration David drew magic music from his harps strings
Saul listened to their words and hope crept into his heart
Provide me now a man that can play well and bring him unto me he
said eagerly
Now the fame of Davids playing and singing had spread even beyond
Bethlehem We must send for David the son of Jesse said the kings
servants at once He was the very person they wanted Not only could he
sing and play but he was a good boy brave and fearless and best of
all as the servants said The Lord is with him
So the shepherd boy was brought to the kings darkened tent ready to do
his bidding Sitting there in the dim light he drew such magic music
from his harps strings and sang such sweet songs that the very song
of the birds seemed to be filling the tent The king as he listened
seemed to feel the breath of the mountain fields to hear the call of
the sheepfold and the murmur of the dancing streams It acted like a
charm The black misery was lifted from his heart and the evil spirit
was put to flight by the song of the shepherd boy
It was no wonder then that the king for a time at least loved the
boy with his bright face and sunny hair and wanted to keep him as his
armourbearer But perhaps as Saul grew well and had no further need of
the music David was no longer wanted and so he went back again to the
Bethlehem fields to look after his sheep
God had made use of Davids skill in music and before very long another
call came to him This time the need was for one who could aim straight
who had a quick eye and a steady hand
War had broken out The fierce Philistines had come up with their great
armies to try and conquer the land Every man in Israel who could fight
was called up to protect his country Already Davids three elder
brothers had joined Sauls army which was preparing to fight the enemy
Illustration Jesse sends David to the camp
On either side of a narrow valley divided by a stream which ran along
over smooth stones the two armies faced each other There they were
encamped like wild beasts ready to fly at each others throats At any
moment the fight might begin and that stream be stained red with blood
Only the Philistines were far the strongest and the Israelites had but
little chance of victory
This valley was seven or eight miles distant from the little town of
Bethlehem and Jesse waited anxiously day after day for news of his
three sons At last he could bear the anxiety no longer and he
determined to send David to the camp to carry food to his brothers and
bring back news how they fared
So very early one morning David set out on his errand He had
carefully put his sheep under the care of another shepherd and he took
with him parched corn and loaves of bread for his brothers as well as
ten cheeses which his father was sending to the officers under whom they
served
It was not long before the boy came within sight of the valley and his
heart began to beat with excitement for he saw that he had arrived just
as something was about to happen The armies were drawn up in battle
array and suddenly a great shout went up from both sides It was the
battlecry of the two armies which sounded in his ears
There was no time now to carry food and gifts so David quickly left his
load at the entrance to the camp and hurried on to search for his
brothers He had learned to find his way about a camp where for a
short time he had been Sauls armourbearer So now he went swiftly
among the soldiers until at last he found his brothers Were they
well he eagerly asked them and what were they doing
Illustration Eagerly David began to ask them what it meant
But even while he spoke there was a stir among the Philistines and all
eyes were turned to watch all ears were strained to hear the enemys
challenge which rang out clearly across the narrow valley
Out of the rank of the Philistines there had stepped a man so tall and
strong that he appeared to be a giant He was more than nine feet high
and the armour which he wore was so solid and heavy that it would have
crushed any ordinary man to the earth
This was Goliath the great champion of the Philistines Every morning
and every evening he strode proudly out and defied the Israelites
bidding them find a champion who would come and fight with him Once
again his challenge rang out on the clear air
Choose you a man for you and let him come down to me If he be able to
fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if I
prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and
serve us I defy the armies of Israel this day Give me a man that we
may fight together
A great silence fell after the champion had shouted his last words of
defiance There was no answer from the Israelites No man had courage
enough to dream of accepting the challenge
David looked round him in amazement and his cheeks burned with shame
What were the people doing to allow this boasting heathen Philistine to
defy the armies of the living God Eagerly he turned to the men around
him and began to ask them what it meant The soldiers answered him
shortly No there was no one who dared to go forth and fight Goliath
The king had promised great rewards to any man who would kill the giant
But no one had dared to try
Davids elder brothers heard his questions and seeing how amazed he
was they began to grow angry Did he mean to reproach them Perhaps he
thought of offering himself to fight the champion It was time that this
shepherd boy should be put in his proper place So his eldest brother
turned to him with a sneer
Illustration While he kept his fathers sheep he had often to defend
them from wild beasts
Why camest thou hither he asked And with whom hast thou left those
few sheep in the wilderness I know thy pride and the naughtiness of thy
heart for thou hast come down that thou mightest see the battle
It could not have been very easy to bear this taunt But David had
learned to conquer himself before he set out to conquer giants So he
answered quietly instead of flashing back an angry reply
What have I done he asked May I not ask a harmless question
There were many questions he still wished to ask and presently the
soldiers began to repeat his words one to another until at last the
report was spread that some one had been found ready and willing to
answer the challenge of the giant Philistine And of course the news
soon reached the kings ear Saul sent immediately and ordered that the
shepherd lad should be brought to him He had quite forgotten about the
boy who had charmed away his black moods with the magic music of his
harp And David had grown and changed since those days
So now when David stood before the king Saul had no idea who he was
and his one thought as he looked at the slender youth was that it was
madness to think of such a mere boy going out to give battle to the
great giant
Thou art not able to go against this Philistine he said for thou
art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth
But David answered eagerly He did not boast but spoke steadily and
wisely True he had not been trained as a soldier but his courage and
his strength had both been already proved And he went on to tell the
king that while he kept his fathers sheep he had often to defend them
from wild beasts Once he had fought with a lion and a bear
singlehanded and had killed them both
Illustration Saul puts his own armour on David
It was not in his own strength that he trusted The Lord that delivered
me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear He will
deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine he ended triumphantly
Faith in God was Davids sure defence and Saul as he listened bowed his
head in shame for it was the faith which he himself had lost It was
this faith he knew which might win the victory It was an echo of the
confidence he had once felt when his whole trust had been in God and he
recognized the true ring of the boys courage
Go he said and the Lord be with thee
Then the king was eager to put his own armour on David and he bade the
soldiers arm him with the royal sword and put a brass helmet on his
head But David was not accustomed to wear heavy armour and had never
been trained to use a sword No he would do his best with the only
weapon he thoroughly understood
So putting on once more his shepherds coat he took his sling in his
hand and as he crossed the brook at the foot of the valley he filled
his shepherds bag with smooth stones and fitted one of them to his
sling Then with springing steps he began to climb the opposite side
The rage of Goliath was great when he saw the slender fairhaired boy
without either armour or sword coming so boldly to meet him
Am I a dog he shouted that thou comest to me with staves
Illustration Davids fight with Goliath
I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts the God of the armies
of Israel whom thou hast defied rang out the clear answer The Lord
saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the Lords and He
will give you into our hands
The great giant lifted his spear ready with one blow to end this
unequal fight But David did not wait to come within reach of the spear
Before Goliath came near the boy stopped suddenly and sent a stone
whizzing through the air straight at the giants head The stone sank
into Goliaths forehead and the great figure reeled and fell with a
mighty crash to the earth Instantly David seized his sword and cut off
his head
Illustration David seized his sword and cut off his head
So Gods people were saved and so again God made use of the shepherd
boys training and skill this time to win a great victory for His
people
The fairhaired shepherd boy had done his duty faithfully in the fields
on the hillside at home where he was but little thought of He had
always tried to do his best whether he was keeping the sheep or
practising with his sling or learning to play the harp And now
suddenly the great opportunity had come and found him ready
He had entered the camp an unnoticed country lad carrying provisions to
his brothers Now every soldier in the camp was shouting his name the
king was ready to shower rewards and honors upon him He was the hero of
the hour
The pleasant days in the Bethlehem fields were now over for David There
was no thought of allowing him to return to his work No the king
declared he must remain as a soldier in the army ready to defend his
king and country Though he was still a mere boy he was placed in
command and set over the men of war
It was much more difficult work than looking after sheep and as time
went on and dangers and difficulties beset him on every side David must
often have longed for the old quiet days on the hillside His path was
rough and dangerous now and sad to say his feet often slipped and he
wandered far astray but always he held fast to his faith in God and
found his way back to the straight path
As the years went by Samuels promise was at last fulfilled and David
was made king over Gods chosen people David had often forgotten God
but God had never forgotten him
What a change it was from the days when he wandered about the fields in
his sheepskin coat often sleeping out under the stars possessing only
his harp and his shepherds sling
Now he wore royal robes and there was a crown of pure gold upon his
head Instead of the starry sky for a roof he now lived in a palace of
cedar wood
And he knew surely that it was God who had taken care of him that it
was God who had set the crown of gold upon his head the seal to the
promise made in that long ago day when the old prophet had poured the
anointing oil upon the head of the wandering shepherd boy
Looking back he saw that he had made many mistakes that his soul was
stained with many sins but he knew too that God would listen when he
prayed Wash me and I shall be whiter than snow
As a little shepherd lad he had cared far more for his sheep than his
own safety He had always been ready to risk his life for them So now
when he became king his people were just as precious to him as his
sheep had been He cared for them with all his heart He was prepared to
suffer himself rather than any hurt should come near them
So perhaps he was after all not unworthy to stand as a type of the
great King great Davids greater Son the little Baby who was to be
born in the town of Bethlehem the Good Shepherd who was to lay down His
life for His sheep
