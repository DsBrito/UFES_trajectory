might not perish
And it came to pass that the next day about evening we saw within a
kenning before us towards the north as it were thick clouds which
did put us in some hope of land knowing how that part of the South Sea
was utterly unknown and might have islands or continents that
hitherto were not come to light  Wherefore we bent our course thither
where we saw the appearance of land all that night and in the dawning
of the next day we might plainly discern that it was a land flat to
our sight and full of boscage which made it show the more dark  And
after an hour and a halfs sailing we entered into a good haven being
the port of a fair city not great indeed but well built and that
gave a pleasant view from the sea and we thinking every minute long
till we were on land came close to the shore and offered to land
But straightways we saw divers of the people with bastons in their
hands as it were forbidding us to land yet without any cries of
fierceness but only as warning us off by signs that they made
Whereupon being not a little discomforted we were advising with
ourselves what we should do
During which time there made forth to us a small boat with about
eight persons in it whereof one of them had in his hand a tipstaff of
a yellow cane tipped at both ends with blue who came aboard our ship
without any show of distrust at all  And when he saw one of our
number present himself somewhat before the rest he drew forth a
little scroll of parchment somewhat yellower than our parchment and
shining like the leaves of writing tables but otherwise soft and
flexible and delivered it to our foremost man  In which scroll were
written in ancient Hebrew and in ancient Greek and in good Latin of
the school and in Spanish these words Land ye not none of you and
provide to be gone from this coast within sixteen days except you
have further time given you  Meanwhile if you want fresh water or
victuals or help for your sick or that your ship needeth repairs
write down your wants and you shall have that which belongeth to
mercy  This scroll was signed with a stamp of cherubim wings not
spread but hanging downwards and by them a cross  This being
delivered the officer returned and left only a servant with us to
receive our answer
Consulting hereupon amongst ourselves we were much perplexed  The
denial of landing and hasty warning us away troubled us much on the
other side to find that the people had languages and were so full of
humanity did comfort us not a little  And above all the sign of the
cross to that instrument was to us a great rejoicing and as it were a
certain presage of good  Our answer was in the Spanish tongue that
for our ship it was well for we had rather met with calms and
contrary winds than any tempests  For our sick they were many and in
very ill case so that if they were not permitted to land they ran
danger of their lives  Our other wants we set down in particular
adding That we had some little store of merchandise which if it
pleased them to deal for it might supply our wants without being
chargeable unto them  We offered some reward in pistolets unto the
servant and a piece of crimson velvet to be presented to the officer
but the servant took them not nor would scarce look upon them and so
left us and went back in another little boat which was sent for him
About three hours after we had dispatched our answer there came
towards us a person as it seemed of place  He had on him a gown with
wide sleeves of a kind of water chamolet of an excellent azure
colour fair more glossy than ours his under apparel was green and so
was his hat being in the form of a turban daintily made and not so
huge as the Turkish turbans and the locks of his hair came down below
the brims of it  A reverend man was he to behold  He came in a boat
gilt in some part of it with four persons more only in that boat and
was followed by another boat wherein were some twenty When he was
come within a flightshot of our ship signs were made to us that we
should send forth some to meet him upon the water which we presently
did in our shipboat sending the principal man amongst us save one
and four of our number with him
When we were come within six yards of their boat they called to us to
stay and not to approach farther which we did  And thereupon the
man whom I before described stood up and with a loud voice in
Spanish asked Are ye Christians  We answered We were fearing
the less because of the cross we had seen in the subscription  At
which answer the said person lifted up his right hand towards Heaven
and drew it softly to his mouth which is the gesture they use when
they thank God and then said If ye will swear all of you by the
merits of the Saviour that ye are no pirates nor have shed blood
lawfully nor unlawfully within forty days past you may have licence
to come on land  We said We were all ready to take that oath
Whereupon one of those that were with him being as it seemed a
notary made an entry of this act  Which done another of the
attendants of the great person which was with him in the same boat
after his Lord had spoken a little to him said aloud My Lord would
have you know that it is not of pride or greatness that he cometh
not aboard your ship but for that in your answer you declare that you
have many sick amongst you he was warned by the Conservator of Health
of the city that he should keep a distance  We bowed ourselves
towards him and answered We were his humble servants and accounted
for great honour and singular humanity towards us that which was
already done but hoped well that the nature of the sickness of our
men was not infectious  So he returned and a while after came the
Notary to us aboard our ship holding in his hand a fruit of that
country like an orange but of color between orangetawney and
scarlet which cast a most excellent odour  He used it as it seemeth
for a preservative against infection  He gave us our oath By the
name of Jesus and his merits and after told us that the next day
by six of the Clock in the Morning we should be sent to and brought
to the Strangers House so he called it where we should be
accommodated of things both for our whole and for our sick So he
left us and when we offered him some pistolets he smiling said He
must not be twice paid for one labour meaning as I take it that he
had salary sufficient of the State for his service  For as I after
learned they call an officer that taketh rewards twice paid
The next morning early there came to us the same officer that came to
us at first with his cane and told us He came to conduct us to the
Strangers House and that he had prevented the hour because we might
have the whole day before us for our business  For said he if
you will follow my advice there shall first go with me some few of
you and see the place and how it may be made convenient for you and
then you may send for your sick and the rest of your number which ye
will bring on land  We thanked him and said That this care which
he took of desolate strangers God would reward  And so six of us
went on land with him and when we were on land he went before us and
turned to us and said He was but our servant and our guide He led
us through three fair streets and all the way we went there were
gathered some people on both sides standing in a row but in so civil
a fashion as if it had been not to wonder at us but to welcome us
and divers of them as we passed by them put their arms a little
abroad which is their gesture when they did bid any welcome
The Strangers House is a fair and spacious house built of brick of
somewhat a bluer colour than our brick and with handsome windows some
of glass some of a kind of cambric oiled  He brought us first into a
fair parlour above stairs and then asked us What number of persons
we were  And how many sick  We answered We were in all sick and
whole one and fifty persons whereof our sick were seventeen  He
desired us to have patience a little and to stay till he came back to
us which was about an hour after and then he led us to see the
chambers which were provided for us being in number nineteen they
having cast it as it seemeth that four of those chambers which were
better than the rest might receive four of the principal men of our
company and lodge them alone by themselves and the other fifteen
chambers were to lodge us two and two together  The chambers were
handsome and cheerful chambers and furnished civilly Then he led us
to a long gallery like a dorture where he showed us all along the one
side for the other side was but wall and window seventeen cells
very neat ones having partitions of cedar wood Which gallery and
cells being in all forty many more than we needed were instituted as
an infirmary for sick persons  And he told us withal that as any of
our sick waxed well he might be removed from his cell to a chamber
for which purpose there were set forth ten spare chambers besides the
number we spake of before  This done he brought us back to the
parlour and lifting up his cane a little as they do when they give
any charge or command said to us Ye are to know that the custom of
the land requireth that after this day and tomorrow which we give
you for removing of your people from your ship you are to keep within
doors for three days  But let it not trouble you nor do not think
yourselves restrained but rather left to your rest and ease  You
shall want nothing and there are six of our people appointed to attend
you for any business you may have abroad  We gave him thanks with
all affection and respect and said God surely is manifested in this
land  We offered him also twenty pistolets but he smiled and only
said What twice paid  And so he left us
Soon after our dinner was served in which was right good viands both
for bread and treat better than any collegiate diet that I have known
in Europe  We had also drink of three sorts all wholesome and good
wine of the grape a drink of grain such as is with us our ale but
more clear And a kind of cider made of a fruit of that country a
wonderful pleasing and refreshing drink  Besides there were brought
in to us great store of those scarlet oranges for our sick which
they said were an assured remedy for sickness taken at sea  There
was given us also a box of small gray or whitish pills which they
wished our sick should take one of the pills every night before
sleep which they said would hasten their recovery
The next day after that our trouble of carriage and removing of our
men and goods out of our ship was somewhat settled and quiet I
thought good to call our company together and when they were
assembled said unto them My dear friends let us know ourselves and
how it standeth with us  We are men cast on land as Jonas was out of
the whales belly when we were as buried in the deep and now we are
on land we are but between death and life for we are beyond both the
old world and the new and whether ever we shall see Europe God only
knoweth  It is a kind of miracle bath brought us hither and it must
be little less that shall bring us hence  Therefore in regard of our
deliverance past and our danger present and to come let us look up
to God and every man reform his own ways  Besides we are come here
amongst a Christian people full of piety and humanity let us not
bring that confusion of face upon ourselves as to show our vices or
unworthiness before them  Yet there is more  For they have by
commandment though in form of courtesy cloistered us within these
wall for three days who knoweth whether it be not to take some
taste of our manners and conditions  And if they find them bad to
banish us straightways if good to give us further time  For these
men that they have given us for attendance may withal have an eye upon
us  Therefore for Gods love and as we love the weal of our souls and
bodies let us so behave ourselves as we may be at peace with God and
may find grace in the eyes of this people  Our company with one voice
thanked me for my good admonition and promised me to live soberly and
civilly and without giving any the least occasion of offence  So we
spent our three days joyfully and without care in expectation what
would be done with us when they were expired During which time we
had every hour joy of the amendment of our sick who thought themselves
cast into some divine pool of healing they mended so kindly and so
fast
The morrow after our three days were past there came to us a new man
that we had not seen before clothed in blue as the former was save
that his turban was white with a small red cross on the top  He had
also a tippet of fine linen  At his coming in he did bend to us a
little and put his arms abroad  We of our parts saluted him in a very
lowly and submissive manner as looking that from him we should
receive sentence of life or death he desired to speak with some few
of us whereupon six of us only staid and the rest avoided the room
He said I am by office governor of this House of Strangers and by
vocation I am a Christian priest and therefore am come to you to offer
you my service both as strangers and chiefly as Christians Some
things I may tell you which I think you will not be unwilling to hear
The State hath given you license to stay on land for the space of six
weeks and let it not trouble you if your occasions ask further time
for the law in this point is not precise and I do not doubt but my
self shall be able to obtain for you such further time as may be
convenient  Ye shall also understand that the Strangers House is at
this time rich and much aforehand for it hath laid up revenue these
thirtyseven years for so long it is since any stranger arrived in
this part and therefore take ye no care the State will defray you all
the time you stay neither shall you stay one day the less for that
As for any merchandise ye have brought ye shall be well used and have
your return either in merchandise or in gold and silver for to us it
is all one  And if you have any other request to make hide it not
For ye shall find we will not make your countenance to fall by the
answer ye shall receive  Only this I must tell you that none of you
must go above a karan that is with them a mile and an half from
the walls of the city without especial leave
We answered after we had looked awhile one upon another admiring this
gracious and parentlike usage That we could not tell what to say
for we wanted words to express our thanks and his noble free offers
left us nothing to ask  It seemed to us that we had before us a
picture of our salvation in Heaven for we that were a while since in
the jaws of death were now brought into a place where we found
nothing but consolations  For the commandment laid upon us we would
not fail to obey it though it was impossible but our hearts should be
enflamed to tread further upon this happy and holy ground  We added
That our tongues should first cleave to the roofs of our mouths ere
we should forget either his reverend person or this whole nation in
our prayers  We also most humbly besought him to accept of us as his
true servants by as just a right as ever men on earth were bounden
laying and presenting both our persons and all we had at his feet
He said He was a priest and looked for a priests reward which was
our brotherly love and the good of our souls and bodies So he went
from us not without tears of tenderness in his eyes and left us also
confused with joy and kindness saying amongst ourselves That we were
come into a land of angels which did appear to us daily and prevent
us with comforts which we thought not of much less expected
The next day about ten of the clock the Governor came to us again and
after salutations said familiarly That he was come to visit us and
called for a chair and sat him down and we being some ten of us
the rest were of the meaner sort or else gone abroad sat down with
him And when we were set he began thus We of this island of
Bensalem for so they call it in their language have this that by
means of our solitary situation and of the laws of secrecy which we
have for our travellers and our rare admission of strangers we know
well most part of the habitable world and are ourselves unknown
Therefore because he that knoweth least is fittest to ask questions it
is more reason for the entertainment of the time that ye ask me
questions than that I ask you
We answered That we humbly thanked him that he would give us leave so
to do and that we conceived by the taste we had already that there
was no worldly thing on earth more worthy to be known than the state
of that happy land  But above all we said since that we were met
from the several ends of the world and hoped assuredly that we should
meet one day in the kingdom of Heaven for that we were both parts
Christians we desired to know in respect that land was so remote
and so divided by vast and unknown seas from the land where our
Saviour walked on earth who was the apostle of that nation and how
it was converted to the faith  It appeared in his face that he took
great contentment in this our question he said Ye knit my heart to
you by asking this question in the first place for it sheweth that
you first seek the kingdom of heaven and I shall gladly and briefly
satisfy your demand
About twenty years after the ascension of our Saviour it came to
pass that there was seen by the people of Renfusa a city upon the
eastern coast of our island within night the night was cloudy and
calm as it might be some mile into the sea a great pillar of light
not sharp but in form of a column or cylinder rising from the sea a
great way up towards heaven and on the top of it was seen a large
cross of light more bright and resplendent than the body of the
pillar  Upon which so strange a spectacle the people of the city
gathered apace together upon the sands to wonder and so after put
themselves into a number of small boats to go nearer to this
marvellous sight  But when the boats were come within about sixty
yards of the pillar they found themselves all bound and could go no
further yet so as they might move to go about but might not approach
nearer so as the boats stood all as in a theatre beholding this light
as an heavenly sign  It so fell out that there was in one of the
boats one of the wise men of the society of Salomons House which
house or college my good brethren is the very eye of this kingdom
who having awhile attentively and devoutly viewed and contemplated this
pillar and cross fell down upon his face and then raised himself upon
his knees and lifting up his hands to heaven made his prayers in this
manner
LORD God of heaven and earth thou hast vouchsafed of thy grace to
those of our order to know thy works of Creation and the secrets of
them and to discern as far as appertaineth to the generations of men
between divine miracles works of nature works of art and impostures
and illusions of all sorts  I do here acknowledge and testify before
this people that the thing which we now see before our eyes is thy
Finger and a true Miracle  And forasmuch as we learn in our books that
thou never workest miracles but to divine and excellent end for the
laws of nature are thine own laws and thou exceedest them not but upon
great cause we most humbly beseech thee to prosper this great sign
and to give us the interpretation and use of it in mercy which thou
dost in some part secretly promise by sending it unto us
When he had made his prayer he presently found the boat he was in
moveable and unbound whereas all the rest remained still fast and
taking that for an assurance of leave to approach he caused the boat
to be softly and with silence rowed towards the pillar  But ere he
came near it the pillar and cross of light brake up and cast itself
abroad as it were into a firmament of many stars which also vanished
soon after and there was nothing left to be seen but a small ark or
chest of cedar dry and not wet at all with water though it swam
And in the foreend of it which was towards him grew a small green
branch of palm and when the wise man had taken it with all reverence
into his boat it opened of itself and there were found in it a Book
and a Letter both written in fine parchment and wrapped in sindons of
linen  The Book contained all the canonical books of the Old and New
Testament according as you have them for we know well what the
churches with you receive and the Apocalypse itself and some other
books of the New Testament which were not at that time written were
nevertheless in the Book  And for the Letter it was in these words
I Bartholomew a servant of the Highest and Apostle of Jesus
Christ was warned by an angel that appeareth to me in a vision of
glory that I should commit this ark to the floods of the sea
Therefore I do testify and declare unto that people where God shall
ordain this ark to come to land that in the same day is come unto them
salvation and peace and goodwill from the Father and from the Lord
Jesus
There was also in both these writings as well the Book as the
Letter wrought a great miracle conform to that of the Apostles in
the original Gift of Tongues  For there being at that time in this
land Hebrews Persians and Indians besides the natives every one
read upon the Book and Letter as if they had been written in his own
language  And thus was this land saved from infidelity as the
remainder of the old world was from water by an ark through the
apostolical and miraculous evangelism of Saint Bartholomew  And here
he paused and a messenger came and called him from us  So this was
all that passed in that conference
The next day the same governor came again to us immediately after
dinner and excused himself saying That the day before he was called
from us somewhat abruptly but now he would make us amends and spend
time with us if we held his company and conference agreeable We
answered That we held it so agreeable and pleasing to us as we
forgot both dangers past and fears to come for the time we hear him
speak and that we thought an hour spent with him was worth years of
our former life  He bowed himself a little to us and after we were
set again he said Well the questions are on your part
One of our number said after a little pause that there was a matter
we were no less desirous to know than fearful to ask lest we might
presume too far  But encouraged by his rare humanity towards us that
could scarce think ourselves strangers being his vowed and professed
servants we would take the hardiness to propound it humbly
beseeching him if he thought it not fit to be answered that he would
pardon it though he rejected it  We said We well observed those his
words which he formerly spake that this happy island where we now
stood was known to few and yet knew most of the nations of the world
which we found to be true considering they had the languages of
Europe and knew much of our state and business and yet we in Europe
notwithstanding all the remote discoveries and navigations of this
last age never heard of the least inkling or glimpse of this island
This we found wonderful strange for that all nations have
interknowledge one of another either by voyage into foreign parts or
by strangers that come to them and though the traveller into a foreign
country doth commonly know more by the eye than he that stayeth at
home can by relation of the traveller yet both ways suffice to make a
mutual knowledge in some degree on both parts  But for this island
we never heard tell of any ship of theirs that had been seen to arrive
upon any shore of Europe nor of either the East or West Indies nor
yet of any ship of any other part of the world that had made return
from them  And yet the marvel rested not in this  For the situation
of it as his lordship said in the secret conclave of such a vast sea
might cause it  But then that they should have knowledge of the
languages books affairs of those that lie such a distance from them
it was a thing we could not tell what to make of for that it seemed to
us a conditioner and propriety of divine powers and beings to be
hidden and unseen to others and yet to have others open and as in a
light to them
At this speech the Governor gave a gracious smile and said That we
did well to ask pardon for this question we now asked for that it
imported as if we thought this land a land of magicians that sent
forth spirits of the air into all parts to bring them news and
intelligence of other countries  It was answered by us all in all
possible humbleness but yet with a countenance taking knowledge that
we knew that he spake it but merrily That we were apt enough to think
there was somewhat supernatural in this island but yet rather as
angelical than magical  But to let his lordship know truly what it was
that made us tender and doubtful to ask this question it was not any
such conceit but because we remembered he had given a touch in his
former speech that this land had laws of secrecy touching strangers
To this he said You remember it aright and therefore in that I shall
say to you I must reserve some particulars which it is not lawful for
me to reveal but there will be enough left to give you satisfaction
You shall understand that which perhaps you will scarce think
credible that about three thousand years ago or somewhat more the
navigation of the world especially for remote voyages was greater
than at this day  Do not think with yourselves that I know not how
much it is increased with you within these sixscore years I know it
well and yet I say greater then than now whether it was that the
example of the ark that saved the remnant of men from the universal
deluge gave men confidence to adventure upon the waters or what it
was but such is the truth  The Phoenicians and especially the
Tyrians had great fleets  So had the Carthaginians their colony
which is yet further west  Toward the east the shipping of Egypt and
of Palestine was likewise great  China also and the great Atlantis
that you call America which have now but junks and canoes abounded
then in tall ships  This island as appeareth by faithful registers
of those times had then fifteen hundred strong ships of great
content  Of all this there is with you sparing memory or none but
we have large knowledge thereof
At that time this land was known and frequented by the ships and
vessels of all the nations before named  And as it cometh to pass
they had many times men of other countries that were no sailors that
came with them as Persians Chaldeans Arabians so as almost all
nations of might and fame resorted hither of whom we have some stirps
and little tribes with us at this day  And for our own ships they
went sundry voyages as well to your straits which you call the
Pillars of Hercules as to other parts in the Atlantic and Mediterrane
Seas as to Paguin which is the same with Cambaline and Quinzy
upon the Oriental Seas as far as to the borders of the East Tartary
At the same time and an age after or more the inhabitants of the
great Atlantis did flourish  For though the narration and description
which is made by a great man with you that the descendants of Neptune
planted there and of the magnificent temple palace city and hill
and the manifold streams of goodly navigable rivers which as so many
chains environed the same site and temple and the several degrees of
ascent whereby men did climb up to the same as if it had been a scala
coeli be all poetical and fabulous yet so much is true that the said
country of Atlantis as well that of Peru then called Coya as that of
Mexico then named Tyrambel were mighty and proud kingdoms in arms
shipping and riches so mighty as at one time or at least within the
space of ten years they both made two great expeditions they of
Tyrambel through the Atlantic to the Mediterrane Sea and they of Coya
through the South Sea upon this our island and for the former of
these which was into Europe the same author amongst you as it
seemeth had some relation from the Egyptian priest whom he cited  For
assuredly such a thing there was  But whether it were the ancient
Athenians that had the glory of the repulse and resistance of those
forces I can say nothing but certain it is there never came back
either ship or man from that voyage  Neither had the other voyage of
those of Coya upon us had better fortune if they had not met with
enemies of greater clemency  For the king of this island by name
Altabin a wise man and a great warrior knowing well both his own
strength and that of his enemies handled the matter so as he cut off
their landforces from their ships and entoiled both their navy and
their tamp with a greater power than theirs both by sea and land arid
compelled them to render themselves without striking stroke and after
they were at his mercy contenting himself only with their oath that
they should no more bear arms against him dismissed them all in safety
But the divine revenge overtook not long after those proud
enterprises  For within less than the space of one hundred years the
great Atlantis was utterly lost and destroyed not by a great
earthquake as your man saith for that whole tract is little subject
to earthquakes but by a particular deluge or inundation those
countries having at this day far greater rivers and far higher
mountains to pour down waters than any part of the old world  But it
is true that the same inundation was not deep not past forty foot in
most places from the ground so that although it destroyed man and
beast generally yet some few wild inhabitants of the wood escaped
Birds also were saved by flying to the high trees and woods  For as
for men although they had buildings in many places higher than the
depth of the water yet that inundation though it were shallow had a
long continuance whereby they of the vale that were not drowned
perished for want of food and other things necessary
So as marvel you not at the thin population of America nor at the
rudeness and ignorance of the people for you must account your
inhabitants of America as a young people younger a thousand years at
the least than the rest of the world for that there was so much time
between the universal flood and their particular inundation  For the
poor remnant of human seed which remained in their mountains peopled
the country again slowly by little and little and being simple and
savage people not like Noah and his sons which was the chief family
of the earth they were not able to leave letters arts and civility
to their posterity and having likewise in their mountainous
habitations been used in respect of the extreme cold of those regions
to clothe themselves with the skins of tigers bears and great hairy
goats that they have in those parts when after they came down into
the valley and found the intolerable heats which are there and knew
no means of lighter apparel they were forced to begin the custom of
going naked which continueth at this day  Only they take great pride
and delight in the feathers of birds and this also they took from
those their ancestors of the mountains who were invited unto it by the
infinite flights of birds that came up to the high grounds while the
waters stood below  So you see by this main accident of time we lost
our traffic with the Americans with whom of all others in regard
they lay nearest to us we had most commerce
As for the other parts of the world it is most manifest that in the
ages following whether it were in respect of wars or by a natural
revolution of time navigation did every where greatly decay and
specially far voyages the rather by the use of galleys and such
vessels as could hardly brook the ocean were altogether left and
omitted  So then that part of intercourse which could be from other
nations to sail to us you see how it hath long since ceased except it
were by some rare accident as this of yours  But now of the cessation
of that other part of intercourse which might be by our sailing to
other nations I must yield you some other cause  For I cannot say if
I shall say truly but our shipping for number strength mariners
pilots and all things that appertain to navigation is as great as
ever and therefore why we should sit at home I shall now give you an
account by itself and it will draw nearer to give you satisfaction to
your principal question
There reigned in this land about nineteen hundred years ago a king
whose memory of all others we most adore not superstitiously but as a
divine instrument though a mortal man his name was Solamona and we
esteem him as the lawgiver of our nation  This king had a large heart
inscrutable for good and was wholly bent to make his kingdom and
people happy  He therefore taking into consideration how sufficient
and substantive this land was to maintain itself without any aid at
