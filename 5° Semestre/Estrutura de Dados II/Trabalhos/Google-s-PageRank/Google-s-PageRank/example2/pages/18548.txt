The late A J Cassatt then a Director of the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company and previous thereto as General Manager and VicePresident and
later as President of that company was deeply interested in obtaining
an entrance into New York City but was not satisfied with the proposed
rapid transit passenger tunnels which required the termination of the
Pennsylvania Railroad trains at its Jersey City Station Therefore upon
his request in September of the same year another study and report was
made by Joseph T Richards M Am Soc C E then Engineer of
Maintenance of Way of the Pennsylvania Railroad on a route beginning in
New York City at 38th Street and Park Avenue on the high ground of
Murray Hill thence crossing the East River on a bridge and passing
around Brooklyn to Bay Ridge thence under the Lower Bay or Narrows to
Staten Island and across to the mainland reaching the New York Division
of the Pennsylvania Railroad at some point between Rahway and Metuchen
Mr Cassatt also had in mind at that time a connection with the New
England Railroad then independent but now part of the New York New
Haven and Hartford Railroad system by means of the Long Island
Railroad and a tunnel under the East River which in later years as
the result of further consideration of the situation has been covered
by the proposed New York Connecting Railroad with a bridge across the
East River and over Wards and Randalls Islands
As a result of these investigations the late George D Roberts who was
then President of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company authorized an
expenditure of about 25000 for soundings to determine the nature of
the strata for tunneling under water These soundings were carefully
made by Mr Richards with a diamond drill bringing up the actual core
of all rock found in crossing the waters of New York Bay from the west
to the east side and extending from the Narrows to the Jersey City
Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad
After these investigations had been made early in 1892 Mr Roberts
expressed himself as being favorable to the undertaking with the
definite limitation that the tunnels must be for small cars doing local
suburban business and for the transfer of Pennsylvania Railroad
passengers to and from New York Brooklyn and Jersey City and not in
any way to be tunnels for standard steam equipment the expense for
terminals and the prohibited use of coal for fuel in such tunnels not
warranting any broader consideration Under such instructions the
interests of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for effecting a physical
entrance into New York City in that year were turned over to Samuel Rea
M Am Soc C E then Assistant to the President of that Company who
has been identified with the investigations and the progress and
construction of this work since that time Mr Cassatt also working in
conjunction with him on the plans then and since considered by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Management
On October 5th 1892 Mr Rea under special direction of President
Roberts made an extended investigation of the various routes which had
then been projected for extending the system into New York City by rail
or transport and reported to Mr Roberts that in his opinion because
of the limitation of the tunnel scheme to rapid transit trains and the
consequent transfer of passengers and traffic carried in passenger
trains and because of the drawbacks caused by the use of steam
locomotives in fullsized tunnels and the objection to cable traction
or any system of transportation which had not then stood the test of
years of practical service the plan of the North River Bridge for
reaching New York City and establishing a terminus therein was the best
that had been evolved up to that time The plan provided a direct rail
entrance into New York City for all railroads reaching the west side of
the Hudson River and also for the New York Central and Hudson River
Railroad as well as adequate station facilities in that city This
bridge would have had one clear span of 3100 ft between pier heads
landing on the New York side at the foot of West 23d Street and thence
the line would have passed diagonally to the terminus at Sixth Avenue
and 25th Street The location of the terminus was subsequently changed
to the vicinity of Seventh Avenue and 36th Street The bridge was
designed with three decks The first or lower deck was to accommodate
eight steam railroad tracks the second was to have six tracks four of
which could be assigned for rapid transit trains operating with electric
power and the other two for steam railroad trains the third deck
reached by elevators was to be a promenade extending from anchorage to
anchorage A connection with the Eleventh Avenue tracks of the New York
Central and Hudson River Railroad was to bring the trains of that road
into the Union Station The Bridge Company had a Federal
chartergranted in 1888with broad powers Gustav Lindenthal M Am
Soc C E was Chief Engineer and he and Mr Rea were corporators and
among its early promoters The Pennsylvania Railroad Management looked
with favor on its construction at that time as subaqueous tunnels with
standard railroad equipment with steam traction were not regarded as a
final or attractive solution of the problem from the standpoint of the
Management and at a subsequent period the Pennsylvania Railroad Company
agreed to use the North River Bridge provided the other roads reaching
the west bank of the Hudson River would join These roads however did
not avail themselves of the opportunity which in its broadest scope was
laid before them in 1900 after the Board of Directors of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company had approved the scheme at the instance of
Mr Cassatt
The scheme of Mr Corbin for a subway connection between Flatbush
Avenue and the Jersey City Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad for
local transit took form in 1892 and jointly with the Pennsylvania
interests railroad companies were incorporated in the respective States
to build a tunnel from under the Jersey City Station under the Hudson
River to Cortlandt Street New York City thence under Maiden Lane the
East River and Pineapple and Fulton Streets Brooklyn to a location at
or near Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues On May 9th 1893 these companies
were merged into the Brooklyn New York and Jersey City Terminal
Railroad Company and estimates and reports on the construction were
made ready by the writer in association with Mr Rea pending
application for the franchises The panic of 1893 occurring about that
time checked further progress on this scheme and before it could be
revived again other important projects for reaching New York City were
given consideration
That part of Mr Corbins plan contemplating a subway under Atlantic
Avenue in Brooklyn to the present Flatbush Avenue Terminal was not a new
idea as a tunnel had been built in 1845 and operated under a portion of
Atlantic Avenue but later it was filled up Plate IV reproduced from a
crayon sketch which was the property of the late William H Baldwin
Jr is a view of this tunnel
In conjunction with schemes for river tunnels complete plans for rapid
transit subways for New York City very much on the line of the present
rapid transit subways were also prepared for Mr Corbin by the writer
These plans provided a system of deep tunnels in rock entirely below
the plane of quicksand and at the Battery the lines were to connect
directly into the tunnels to Long Island and New Jersey respectively
and the stations throughout where the rock was at a deep level were to
be fitted with elevators grouped as suggested in Plate V using private
property on each side of the street at station locationsone side for
northbound and the other side for southbound traffic These plans were
submitted to the first Rapid Transit Commission and after long
consideration were rejected by that Commission because they provided
for the construction of the tunnels by a private company
notwithstanding Mr Corbin gave the Commission assurances of ample
financial means to carry the work to completion
During the years 189293 Mr Corbin was convinced that it was necessary
to get better facilities for handling the baggage and express matter of
the Long Island Railroad and the Long Island Express Company across the
East River between Long Island City and New York City and he
instructed the writer to investigate and report on the feasibility of
building a tunnel along the lines of the East River Gas Tunnels then
nearly completed between the foot of East 34th Street New York City
and the Long Island City Station of the Long Island Railroad In 1893 an
investigation was made for such a tunnel to be of similar size to the
East River Gas Tunnel 8 by 10 ft solely for the purpose of handling
baggage and express matter Investigation was made and estimates
prepared but the cost was considered to be prohibitive in view of the
possible earnings solely from the handling of baggage and express and
the matter was not considered further

While Mr Corbin was deeply interested in the downtown river tunnels
the uptown situation was of great importance to the Long Island
Railroad and having allied himself with Mr Charles Pratt they took
up generally the franchise owned by Dr Thomas Rainey for a bridge over
Blackwells Island Mr Corbin became interested with Dr Rainey in
1894 and the actual construction proceeded on this bridge The design
provided for four railroad tracks besides highways for tracks
pedestrians etc with a terminal station at Third Avenue and 64th
Street New York City which under the franchise was the limit to
which the railroad could proceed
At this period there were two projects for bridging the Hudson or North
River the New York and New Jersey Bridge Company at about 59th Street
and the North River Bridge Company at 23d Street as hereinbefore
described Several studies were made by the writer with the idea of
making a rail connection between the Long Island Rainey bridge and a
bridge over the North River An overhead structure connection was
prohibitory as no franchise could be obtained to cross Fifth Avenue
with an overhead structure Sketches were prepared for a subway
construction to connect with the bridges but a final plan was not
worked out
The failure to carry out the joint undertaking with the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company in 1893 led Mr Corbin to revive the scheme of
extending the Long Island Railroad from Flatbush Avenue Brooklyn to
New York City therefore consideration was given to a relocation of the
route for Mr Corbin during the early months of 1896 the idea being
that the entire uptown outlet for the Long Island Railroad would be by
Blackwells Island Bridge and the tunnel project would give the
downtown outlet
At this time a commission had been appointed by the Legislature to
investigate the conditions on Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn and evolve some
scheme for the elimination of grade crossings on that avenue Early in
1896 plans were prepared and presented to this Commission first for a
subway from Flatbush Avenue Terminal for the entire distance to the
limits of the City of Brooklyn at Elderts Lane second for a subway
from the Flatbush Avenue Terminal to East New York Manhattan Crossing
the railroad to remain as it previously existed at grade through the
26th Ward of Brooklyn Each of these schemes contemplated an extension
through Brooklyn to New York City at Cortlandt Street and Broadway and
surveys and borings for this work were made across the East River In
the summer of 1896 on the decease of Mr Corbin all projects and work
were immediately stopped but after some months Mr W H Baldwin
Jr when elected President of the Long Island Railroad Company took up
actively the reconsideration of the means whereby the Long Island
Railroad could reach New York City After the fullest consideration he
decided that the Blackwells Island Bridge was by no means a suitable
adequate or convenient entry for the Long Island Railroad into New York
City as it involved too great a cost and altogether too rigid a
connection it was also a very inconvenient location inasmuch as it was
cut off from convenient access to the west side of New York City by
Central Park
For the downtown connection Mr Baldwin became enthusiastic but he
had in mind throughout the allimportant necessity for the Long Island
Railroad to reach the Pennsylvania Railroad across the North River At
the same time Mr Baldwin took up energetically the Atlantic Avenue
Improvement with the Atlantic Avenue Commission and on consideration
decided it was essential that it should extend through the 26th Ward
above or below grade The better plan of course was obviously to make
it a subway throughout but further the residents of this ward
objected to the subway through that section and that construction would
have made any change of the Manhattan Beach Division at Manhattan
Crossing very difficult for the future besides this the controlling
factor was the absolute limitation by the City of Brooklyn of the amount
of expenditure therefor in which they would participate therefore a
composite scheme which is the plan as carried out was agreed upon
being in part subway and part elevated This scheme reached a focus
early in 1897 and the law constituting the Board for the Atlantic
Avenue Improvement was passed with a provision in the last paragraph of
the Act for the construction of a tunnel from Flatbush Avenue Terminal
under Flatbush Avenue and Fulton Street to Pineapple Street crossing
the river to Broadway and Maiden Lane Cortlandt Street New York City
and with the understanding that it would be extended beyond the New York
State Line to the Pennsylvania Railroad Station in New Jersey This gave
the legal right for the construction of this tunnel and on June 20th
1899 the New York and Long Island Terminal Railroad Company was
incorporated for the purpose Mr Baldwin being President and J V
Davies M Am Soc C E Chief Engineer Application was immediately
made to the Boards of Aldermen of Brooklyn and of New York City The
latter acted favorably on the application but the Board of Aldermen of
Brooklyn held the matter up while the Rapid Transit Commission laid out
and promulgated the plan for Contract No 2 of the Rapid Transit Subway
With the understanding that the Rapid Transit Brooklyn extension would
be constructed to the Flatbush Avenue Terminal Mr Baldwin withdrew the
application for the independent franchise and agreed to proceed with
the Atlantic Avenue Improvement on the basis of the City proceeding
with the Brooklyn extension of the Rapid Transit Subway This provided
for the Long Island Railroad entry down town

Subsequently however it was proved that Mr Baldwin had not been fully
satisfied that this was the proper solution of the matter for on April
12th 1901 and upon his recommendation the Board of Directors of the
Long Island Railroad Company took over from the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company its entire interests in the old Brooklyn New York and Jersey
City Terminal Railway Company thus giving him control of the route from
Flatbush Avenue via Maiden Lane and Cortlandt Street to underneath the
Jersey City station
In the early part of 1900 active consideration was being given by the
Pennsylvania Railroad and other railroads terminating in New Jersey to
the proposed North River Bridge as hereinbefore stated and for the
Long Island Railroad Mr Baldwin organized a new company to construct a
tunnel from the Long Island Railroad at Sunnyside Yard diving under the
streets of Long Island City by two tracks under the East River to the
foot of 33d Street and then proceeding under 33d Street as far as
Seventh Avenue A station was to be located at Fourth Avenue below the
Rapid Transit Subway Station and also a large Terminal Station at
Broadway For this purpose an option was obtained on the property of the
Newbold Lawrence Estate at Broadway Sixth Avenue 33d and 34th
Streets now occupied by Saks Store Mr Baldwin however considered
that the amount of the investment 1600000 for that property was too
great for this purpose and allowed the option to expire The property
was sold within a week thereafter to the Morganthau Syndicate for
2000000 At this time May 1900 the Pennsylvania Railroad obtained
a controlling interest in the Long Island Railroad and thereafter the
two schemes became one Mr Baldwin and Mr Rea purchased two 25ft
lots on 33d Street just east of Broadway for an entrance to the
underground station Plans were also prepared for extending this line
from Seventh Avenue northward under Seventh Avenue to 45th Street The
investigation and preliminary work in connection with this project were
carried out in the early part of 1900
Reconsideration was given by Mr Baldwin to the proposed location of the
uptown tunnels with the idea of connecting the New York Central and
Hudson River Railroad by a tunnel between Long Island City Long Island
Railroad Station and the foot of 42d Street and extending to the Grand
Central Station but nothing further than investigation and the
preparation of estimates was done on this
In the summer of 1901 Mr Cassatt was in Paris and was advised by Mr
Rea of the opening of the extension of the Orleans Railway to the Quai
dOrsay Station and its successful operation by electric power also of
the possibility of the Pennsylvania Railroad reaching New York City in a
similar way the other trunk lines not having joined in the promotion of
the North River Bridge project He at once examined the new line and
then consulted the writer in London in relation to the possibility of
building tunnels under the North River The writer returned to New York
with Mr Cassatt and soon thereafter a conference of Mr Cassatt Mr
Rea and Mr Baldwin with the writer and Mr Davies was held in the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company Office in New York when Mr Cassatt
outlined the scheme practically as it is now carried out the only
difference being that he also proposed a station on property of the New
York and Harlem Railroad Company at 33d Street which was soon abandoned
on account of the grade from the East River and particularly because
of the superior location of the adopted site at Seventh Avenue and 33d
Street this being central between the downtown commercial and
financial district and Central Park which divides New York City On Mr
Cassatts instructions surveys and investigations were begun in
November 1901 and estimates drawings etc were made Preliminary
estimates were presented to him on November 8th 1901 Following this
borings were continued and a plan was presented to Mr Cassatt for
assisting the support of the North River tunnels on piles if necessary
At the time of the appointment of the Board of Engineers and the general
organization of the work the preliminary investigations and work had
been carried to an advanced state
One result of the determination of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to
extend its lines into New York City and thus move its principal station
from Jersey City was that the downtown local and suburban as well as
through business was not provided for properly Mr William G McAdoo
appreciating this opportunity revived the scheme of an electric subway
from Jersey City to New York originally promoted by Mr Corbin and
associates but not including the extension via Maiden Lane to
Brooklyn and entered into negotiations with the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company to provide for this downtown business by extensions of the
tunnel lines of the New York and New Jersey Railroads to Exchange Place
Jersey City under the Pennsylvania Railroad Station and thence across
the Hudson River to Cortlandt and Church Streets As a result the
Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company was organized in 1902 and
contracts were made with the Pennsylvania Railroad Company for the
subsurface use of its station in Jersey City and for the interchange
of passenger business at that point between the trains of the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company and the tunnel of the Hudson and Manhattan
Railroad Company Later a further contract was made with the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company providing for the construction of the
tunnel of the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company westward under the
tracks of the Pennsylvania Railroad in Jersey City to a junction with
the latter at Summit Avenue at which point can be installed a joint
station and the operation effected of a joint electric train service
between Church Street New York City and Newark N J the
Pennsylvania Railroad tracks between Summit Avenue and Newark to be
electrified for that purpose with a transfer station established east
of Newark at Harrison at which point the steam and electric
locomotives will exchange By means of this all downtown passengers
will transfer to the electric service at Harrison Station and thus the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company is expected to be relieved of maintaining
a separate steam service for passenger traffic to Jersey City and a
large downtown station with extensive contingent facilities at that
point
From the foregoing it will be seen that the final decision to extend the
Pennsylvania Railroad into and through New York City by a system of
tunnels and erect a large station in that city on a most eligible site
was not reached in a hurried or offhand manner but after years of
painstaking study and a full and extended investigation of all routes
projects and schemes whether originating with the company or suggested
by others

Plate VI is a map of New York City and vicinity on which are shown the
various lines contemplated in the evolution of the New York Tunnel
Extension of the Pennsylvania Railroad hereinbefore outlined
The question of tunnels under the North River was an uncertain factor in
the larger Pennsylvania Railroad scheme owing to the nature of the
ground composing the river bed in which the tunnels would be
constructed
It is well known that about 35 years ago an attempt was made to
construct a tunnel under the North River by using a Pilot system under
compressed air and forming the tunnels in brick masonry Owing to the
very soft nature of the materials through which it passed several
serious accidents occurred and the work was abandoned after about 2000
ft of tunnel had been constructed Later this work was taken up again
when a shield was installed and an additional 1800 ft was built with
castiron segmental lining but the work was again abandoned owing
principally to financial difficulties while coincidentally before
entering a rock reef which presented another serious difficulty in
construction The experience then in the construction of this tunnel led
capitalists and engineers to believe that owing to the very soft nature
of the ground a tunnel could not be built that would be sufficiently
stable to withstand the vibration due to heavy traffic and for this
reason tunnels under the North River were not looked upon as
practicable The writer devised a scheme to carry within the tunnel the
rolling loads on bridging supported on piers or piles extending from
the tunnel invert down to hard material These would be attached to the
tunnel itself or would pass into it independently through sliding joints
in the tunnel shell This scheme gained the confidence of the
management as it was believed that by adopting such a plan tunnels
could be built in the soft material underlying the Hudson River and
remain stable under all conditions of traffic After thus feeling
assured that by this method the tunnels could be made safe beyond
question orders were given to proceed with the great work of the
extension into New York of the Pennsylvania and Long Island Railroad
systems

center line which had been assumed as the center line of 32d Street
extended westward was slightly changed
The grade adopted was approximately 2 descending westward from Ninth
Avenue which would place the tunnel well below the Government dredging
plane of 40 ft below mean low water at the pier head line thence
