WILD BEES OF THE WOOD ARE WE
BUT OUR HIVE YOU MUST NOT SEE
VOL XXIINO 1
THE WILD BEES HOME
WILD bees of the wood are we
But our hive you must not see
Here behold our happy home
Where we labor where we roam
Brooks that on their shining bosoms
Catch the overhanging blossoms
Banks all bright with clustering flowers
Here is where we pass our hours
Seldom on this solitude
Does a girl or boy intrude
Few among you are aware
What a home is ours so fair
In the brook are little fish
You would like them on a dish
Keep away and bring no hooks
To these happy murmuring brooks
You would like to find our hoard
Of honeycomb and honey stored
You would track us if you could
Through the field and through the wood
Till within some hollow tree
You our waxen cells could see
But beware now what you do
Treat us well and well treat you

PERCY AND THE OXEN
SUMMER came and the city streets were dry dusty and noisy and the
bricks made everybodys eyes ache
So mamma took little Percy who was only three years old and the rosy
fat oneyearold baby and went away in the steam cars to the green
fresh cool sunny country Grandpa was left all alone in the still city
home with good old Titia to keep house for him until the family should
come back in the fall
Well those who could go to the country had just as much fun as they
could wish forsitting out under the trees all the sunny days and in
the barn when the sun was too hot for them to want him to shine on
them
One day greataunt Hannah was giving her nephews and nieces a dinner of
corn and beans and apples and cream and nice bread and butter and
they all sat at the table a long time talking and laughing and
enjoying themselves
All at once little mamma said Why wheres Percy and sprang up and
ran to the sidedoor which opened on to the green
No Percy was to be seen there so all began to hunt through the
sittingroom even through the parlor where he never played out in
the kitchen farther out through the long woodshed still farther out
in the carriagehouse but he was in none of these places
Then greataunt Hannah opened the cupboards and pulled out the drawers
as though she expected to find the grandboy rolled up in a napkin
and tucked away in a corner
There was a high state of flutter when mamma peeped round the edge of
the open diningroom door and said Come with me
She was so smiling that every one knew the search was up and a row of
tall people and short people headed by little mamma and ended by tall
aunt Hannah streamed out and over the green across the road There
they were stopped and told by mamma to go softly and look in one of the
barnwindows
What did they see A good load of sweetscented hay piled on a wide
haycart two big oxen yoked to that standing in the middle of the
barnfloor with their two great heads held down very low
In front of them was little chubby Percy in his clean white frock
swinging a tiny pail that would hold a teaspoonful of berries in one
hand and with the other holding out a berry to the oxen as they put
their great mouths down to be fed

PET RABBITS
MANY of my little readers have owned tame rabbits but I doubt if they
ever had for a pet the little wild rabbit who lives in the woods and
at the South builds his nest above ground
On a warm sunny afternoon in May two little rabbits whose mother had
been killed by a dog were brought home in a gentlemans pocket and
given to my little boys They were not old enough to feed themselves so
we put some milk in a small bottle and tied a piece of sponge to the
neck of it and in that way the little things sucked up the milk
The children had a large oldfashioned fireplace in their room and
after taking out the andirons they covered the bricks with fresh clover
and grass making a safe and snug home for the rabbits at night Several
times a day they were allowed to run about the lawn and crop the sweet
white clover and often at night they would jump out from their home in
the fireplace and run about the room
They were named George and Mary Rabbit and always used to sleep side by
side But after a few weeks they must have felt tired of their humdrum
life for one bright morning they ran away I hope they are living
happily together in the fragrant woods from which they were brought

FOURTH OF JULY MORNING
MAT Let and Win are the names by which three little sisters of my
acquaintance are usually called These are nicknames of course Can you
guess what their real names are
Lest you should be too long about it I will tell you they are Matilda
Letitia and Winifred Mat is the one standing on the chair in the
picture Let is the one sitting on the bed with her left foot hanging
down and Win the youngest is the one sitting up in bed
What is the cause of all this commotion It is only four oclock in the
morning but Mat and Let have rushed into Wins room to get a good view
out of her window of the men firing guns out on the green It is the
Fourth of July
Why do they wake us up so early with their bellringing their
crackers and guns said Let I hate the Fourth of July
She talks like a rebel said Win She must be put in prison
That is not a bad idea Win said Mat She hates the Fourth of July
does shethe birthday of the great republic She hates itthe day
that made us a nation
Yes and I hate the stars and stripes and all this fuss and noise
this smell of smoke and firing of crackers said Let showing a fist
Jump up Win and help me arrest this rebel said Mat The country is
lost if we allow such talk
The next minute the three sisters were running about the roomMat and
Win trying to catch poor Let and thrust her into the closet which was
to be her prison Such a stamping such an outcry as there was
Whats all that racket there cried papa at last from the foot of
the stairs that led into his room underneath Isnt there noise enough
out of doors without your shaking the house over our heads
Let says she hates the Fourth of July and the old flag cried Mat
and we think she ought to be put in prison as a rebel We are trying to
arrest her
Go to bed every one of you you rogues said papa or I will put you
all in prison for breaking the peaceWheres my big whip mother
Ill tell you where it is papa cried little Win
Where then is it you little darlI mean you little rogue said
papa
It is where Cinderellas glass slippers are screamed Win Ask the
fairies where that is
What a scampering and laughing there was then
Papa made a pounding with his feet on the stairs as if he were coming
up in a great rage but he and mamma were laughing all the time and so
were Mat and Letall but Win and she kept a grave face
It was now almost five oclock and the three sisters made up their
minds that they would dress themselves and go out on the green to see
the fun

A FISH STORY
COUSIN WILLIE lives on a pleasant island in Chesapeake Bay He has a
boat called the Nautilus One morning he was taking a sail in his
boat when he saw a large fishhawk soaring and wheeling through the
air as though in search of a breakfast for its young nestlings At
length it made a dive down to the water and brought up a large fish
Just then an eagle that had been watching the fishhawk from the top of
a tree came swooping down toward the hawk as if determined to have the
fish for his own breakfast
The eagle attacked the hawk and the two birds fought for the fish until
the hawk was forced to let it drop when the eagle made a rapid swoop
and caught the fish in his talons
Cousin Willie from his boat watched the fight of the birds and
thought he would like to make the bold robber give up his prey So he
shot at him with a pistol and gave him such a fright that he dropped
the fish in his turn
Willie picked up the fish took it home and laid it upon a table in the
kitchen to be cooked for dinner But a sly old cat saw it on the table
and as no one was near to prevent she grabbed it quickly and stole
away with it to give herself and her kittens a breakfast
Thus the cunning puss and her kitties you see
Got the better of those brave fishers three

BUTTERCUPS CIRCUS
FRED and Bertie two little blackeyed boys were visiting their Aunt
Susan in a beautiful country village The large oldfashioned house
under a giant elmtree was full of wonders to them but their greatest
delights were in driving the old gray horse or feeding and petting an
Alderney calf which their Uncle Harry was raising
This babycow as little Bertie called her was kept away from its
mother old Clover most of the day and tied to a cherrytree in the
side yard The boys named her Buttercup They were allowed to feed her
with meal and water and she soon grew so tame that they could pat and
caress her as much as they pleased
One day Fred found an old saddle in the stable and he proposed to
Bertie to help him put it on the calf and have a ride the length of
her rope They succeeded in fastening it upon Buttercups smooth back
and Freddie exclaimed with delight Now we will have a firstclass
circus
They brought a chair from the house and placed it by the side of Miss
Cow she looking wonderingly at them with great round eyes The boys
both stood together in the chair and Fred said Now I will count and
when I say four we must spring upon the saddle Onetwothreefour
and on they went
But before they could have said five Miss Buttercups heels were in
the air and her head went down so quickly that Master Fred felt a
sudden chill and found himself in a tub of rainwater that stood under
the eaves of the woodshed while Bertie went headforemost into a pan
of meal and water
A slight noise followed their fall Their uncle and aunt appeared The
saddle was sent back to the stable and the boys did not engage
Buttercup for any more circus performances that summer

AT SEA
BARK MURRAY PACIFIC OCEAN December 1876
Dear NurseryI am making a voyage on a sailing vessel from San
Francisco to the Sandwich Islands We have been on the water for three
weeks
Every day at noon if the sun shines the captain comes up on deck with
a queer thing in his hand which he calls a sextant With this he looks
at the sun and finds out just where on this great ocean we are and
just how far we have gone in the last twentyfour hours Today he says
we are three hundred miles from Honolulu
Illustration
There are twenty sails on this ship I love to lie down on deck and
look at them and I think it is a beautiful sight to see them all spread
and filled with wind It almost seems as if their tops touched the sky
All the masts and sails and ropes have names I am sure it would take me
a good while to learn them but all the sailors know them
When the captain wants a sail changed he gives the order in a very loud
tone then the first mate who is never very far from the captain
repeats the order and then the sailors run quickly to the ropes and
pull away and sing while they pull and the sail goes up or down just
as the captain wants it
Every hour a sailor takes his turn at steering the ship so there is
always one man at the wheel There is a large bell swung just in front
of him which he strikes every halfhour to mark the time When it is
twelve oclock he strikes the bell eight times and it is eight bells
again at four oclock and at eight oclock The first hour after eight
bells is two bells the second four bells the third six bells and
the halfhours strike the odd numbersthree five and seven bells It
is a very funny way to tell time I think
One day the captain slung a hammock on deck and we had a nice time
swinging in it Another day when the sea was very calm he hung a rope
from the rigging and made a real swing for us We have long fishlines
which we throw over the ships side Once a gentleman on board caught a
beautiful dolphin all green and blue and gold The steward made a nice
chowder out of the dolphin for our lunch and we had baked dolphin for
dinner that day
Thanksgiving Eve a little lamb was born on board The sailors named it
Thanksgiving for the day It is a dear little lamb nowso white and
gentle We have tied a blue ribbon around its neck and it will run all
over the deck after us and go to sleep in our laps There is a cunning
little pig too which I call Dennis after the pig that I read about
in The Nursery I wish it were really the same wonderful little pig
but mamma says she does not think it can be
I must tell you about the beautiful bouquet the steward made for our
Thanksgiving dinner It was made out of vegetables with a knifeyellow
roses from carrots and white roses japonicas and tuberoses from
turnips and potatoes Some of the petals he dipped into beetwater and
so made blush roses of them Then he made two canarybirds of carrots
and perched them among the flowers Mamma said that she had seen many a
cluster of wax flowers that were not as beautiful
Perhaps I will write again when we arrive at Honolulu

SOLOMON AND THE TAME BEAR
UNCLE REUBEN was a farmer and he had a great many cattle sheep
horses pigs geese and turkeys all of which you know are usually
found on a large farm and besides these he had one animal not usually
found on a farm and that was a tame bear He hired a large boy to do
the chores as the easy part of farmwork is called and this boys
name was Solomon Sturtevant
Now although the bear was tame he was kept chained for there was no
knowing what mischief even a tame bear might take it into his head to
do He might take a notion to find out how a nice tender pig would
taste
Solomon thought it fine sport to tease the bear and there was one way
of doing it more amusing than any other and that was to pelt him with
green chestnutburs
Chestnutburs you know are covered with sharp thorns and yet the
bear being very fond of chestnuts would try to get at the nuts which
he knew were in themsnarling and whining and making up very comical
faces because the burs pricked his mouth
Solomon would stand and watch him and think it fine fun But he came
near doing it once too often for one day when he had carried the bear
a capful of burs intending to have a good laugh at him the chain that
held the bear was not fastened as firmly as usual After trying two or
three burs the bear made a spring toward Solomon got loose from his
chain and started after him in earnest
Solomon was not long in deciding that he had something to do that time
besides laughing and started in a hurry to get out of the bears way
Now there was a ladder leaning against the side of the barn close by
and Solomon thought that if he went up on the barnroof he would be all
right
Illustration
No such thing The bear went right up the ladder after him Then Solomon
ran up the roof to the ridge but the bear followed Solomon ran down
the other side of the roof and so did the bear Solomon jumped down to
the cowhouse and still the bear followed him Then Solomon jumped on
to a shed that was close by the cowhouse and the bear jumped too
Solomon now began to think that his time had come He gave one more jump
from the shed to the ground This was too much of a jump for the bear to
take and so Solomon made good his escape
I do not remember how the bear got down but I am sure that when he
did Solomon did not care to feed him any more with green chestnutburs
I think Solomon was too glad to escape a hugging to try it very soon
again
This is a true story

AT DINNER
MY little kittens here you see
Are just as good as they can be
Not often do three children dine
Who are as wellbehaved as mine
Ive taught them how to be polite
To keep their bibs all clean and white
To say Meeoo for If you please
And never to be cross or tease
My darlings Muff and Puff and Fluff
Stop always when theyve had enough
They never come unwashed or late
They never crowd or push the plate
My care has not been vainly spent
Thats why I purr with such content
For Im the milkwhite puss you know
That sits close bytheir motherSNOW

SIXTH LESSON IN ASTRONOMY
DID you ever hear of a great bear and a little bear made of stars And a
big dog And a lion If you never did I suppose you would like to be
told where they aresuch astonishing things as animals made of stars
But if you think a minute you will see that every thing that has any
thing to do with stars must be up in the sky
Now this very night if the stars come out before you go to bed I want
you to look for the Great Bear It is not a real bear of course but it
is a kind of picture of a bear I wish it could growl to give you an
idea where it is because it really looks so little like a bear it is
very hard to find It is nearly overhead now but you neednt be a bit
frightened The Great Bear has never been known to drop down on little
girls and boys
There is a funny thing about this bear Part of him is a big dipper and
I think you will find him out by that If you can find the seven bright
stars in the shape of a dipper you have found the bears tail and a
part of his body
And now I want to tell you how it happens that these stars are called
the Great Bear If you look up in the sky some bright starlight night
you will see there a good many different figures in stars and a long
time ago people gave names to these figures To one of them they gave
the name of the Great Bear to another the Little Bear to another the
Great Dog and so on These different starfigures are called
constellations They really look very little like the things they are
named for so I cant expect you to find them without help
Now it is very convenient to have the stars divided up in this way
When I asked you to find the red star last winter it would have been a
great help to you if I had told you what constellation it was in but
you might not have known what I meant by a constellation
I had so many pleasant letters about that red star I am going to ask
you to write again when you find the Great Bear although I suppose most
of you are abed and asleep before he comes out for the night He will
appear earlier when the days are shorter and I do not believe he can
escape all your bright eyes But I should advise you to ask some one who
knows where he is to point him out to you

TEDDYS KITTEN
TO let the kitten lie and sleep
Is something Teddy cannot do
Like caterpillar in a heap
Shed like to curl the whole day through
If Teddy did but want her to
I wonder if she understands
How just the look of her soft fur
So tempts his little roguish hands
He cannot keep away from her
He says he wants to hear her purr
And if he does tis well enough
But then why does he rub the way
To make her silky coat look rough
That coat of shining silvergray
So washed and polished every day
Why is it that he loves so much
To tickle the unconscious paws
With just a finger tip or touch
Or open them to find the claws
His reason for it is Because
When Teddy sometime wanted rest
What if a giant came and sat
Beside him when he slept the best
And rolled him this way rubbed him that
And teased him as he does the cat
Do you believe hed smile and blink
And bear the teasing patiently
I think hed wink a sleepy wink
And say not over pleasantly
O giant please to let me be

WHEN little Jack Horner was eating pie he put in his thumb and pulled
out a plum When Marys mother reads to her out of a book the little
girl acts a good deal like Jack
She puts out her finger and points to the pictures She thinks them
the best part of the book They are her plums
Illustration
If Mary calls out Moooo you may know that she sees a picture of
cows Here is the very one she found a day or two ago In it you see two
cowsa big one and a little one The big cow is standing up and the
little cow is lying beside her
The little cow has no horns Mary calls it a little cow because it
looks too old to be called a calf
Here is the very picture that Mary was looking at when she called out
Baaa
How many sheep do you see in it There are two lying down there is one
standing up that makes three Is that all
Illustration
Look very sharp See if you cant find more of them Mary found some
straying about on the hills She thought she could see lambs too but
