PREFACE
This book deals chiefly with the authors adventures during a journey
taken in Tibet in 1897 when that country owing to religious
fanaticism was closed to strangers For the scientific results of the
expedition for the detailed description of the customs manners etc
of the people the larger work entitled In the Forbidden Land Harper
Brothers publishers by the same author should be consulted
During that journey of exploration the author made many important
geographical discoveries among which may be mentioned
a The discovery of the two principal sources of the Great
Brahmaputra River one of the four largest rivers in the world
b The ascertaining that a high range of mountains existed north of
the Himahlyas but with no such great elevations as the highest of the
Himahlyan range
c The settlement of the geographical controversy regarding the
supposed connection between the Sacred Mansarowar and the Devils
Rakastal lakes
d The discovery of the real sources of the Sutlej River
In writing geographical names the author has given the names their true
sounds as locally pronounced and has made no exception even for the
poetic word Himahlya the abode of snow which in English is usually
misspelt and distorted into the meaningless Himalaya
All bearings of the compass given in this book are magnetic Temperature
observations were registered with Fahrenheit thermometers

ADVENTURES IN TIBET
CHAPTER I
A FORBIDDEN COUNTRY
Tibet was a forbidden land That is why I went there
This strange country cold and barren lies on a high tableland in the
heart of Asia The average height of this desolate tablelandsome
15000 feet above sealevelis higher than the highest mountains of
Europe People are right when they call it the roof of the world
Nothing or next to nothing grows on that high plateau except poor
shrubs and grass in the lower valleys The natives live on food imported
from neighboring countries They obtain this by giving in exchange wool
borax iron and gold
High mountain ranges bound the Tibetan plateau on all sides The highest
is the Himahlya range to the south the loftiest mountain range on
earth From the south it is only possible to enter Tibet with an
expedition in summer when the mountain passes are not entirely blocked
by snow
At the time of my visit the law of Tibet was that no stranger should be
allowed to enter the country The Tibetan frontier was closely guarded
by soldiers
A few expeditions had travelled in the northern part of Tibet as the
country was there practically uninhabited They had met with no one to
oppose their march save perhaps a few miserable nomads No one since
Tibet became a forbidden country to strangers had been able to
penetrate in the Province of Lhassathe only province of Tibet with a
comparatively thick population It was this province the most forbidden
of all that forbidden land that I intended to explore and survey I
succeeded in my object although I came very near paying with my life
for my wish to be of use to science and my fellowcreatures
With the best equipment that money could buy for scientific work I
started for the Tibetan frontier in 1897 From Bombay in India I
travelled north to the end of the railway at Kathgodam and then by
carts and horses to Naini Tal At this little hillstation on the lower
Himahlyas in the northwest Province of India I prepared my
expedition resolved to force my way in the Unknown Land
Naini Tal is 6407 feet above the level of the sea From this point all
my loads had to be carried on the backs of coolies or porters
Therefore each load must not exceed fifty pounds in weight I packed
instruments negatives and articles liable to get damaged in cases of
my own manufacture specially designed for rough usage A set of four
such cases of wellseasoned deal wood carefully joined and fitted
zinclined and soaked in a special preparation by which they were
rendered water and air tight could be made useful in many ways Taken
separately they could be used as seats Four placed in a row answered
the purpose of a bedstead Three could be used as seat and table The
combination of four used in a certain manner made a punt or boat of
quick solid and easy construction with which an unfordable river
could be crossed or for taking soundings in the still waters of
unexplored lakes The cases could be used as tanks for photographic
work In case of emergency they might serve even as watercasks for
carrying water in regions where it was not to be found Each of these
boxes packed was exactly a coolie load or else in sets of two they
could be slung over a packsaddle by means of straps with rings
My provisions had been specially prepared for me and were suited to the
severe climate and the high elevations I should find myself in The
preserved meats contained a vast amount of fat and carbonaceous or
heatmaking food as well as elements easily digestible and calculated
to maintain ones strength in moments of unusual stress I carried a
256 Mannlicher rifle a MartiniHenry and 1000 cartridges duly packed
in a watertight case I also had a revolver with 500 cartridges a
number of huntingknives skinning implements wire traps of several
sizes for capturing small mammals butterflynets bottles for
preserving reptiles in alcohol insectkilling bottles cyanide of
potassium a quantity of arsenical soap bone nippers scalpels and
all other accessories necessary for the collection of naturalhistory
specimens There were in my outfit three sets of photographic cameras
and a dozen dry plates as well as all adjuncts for the developing
fixing printing etc of the negatives I had two complete sets of
instruments for astronomical observations and for use in surveying One
set had been given to me by the Royal Geographical Society of London
The other was my own Each set consisted of the following instruments A
sixinch sextant The hypsometrical apparatus a device used for
measuring heights by means of boilingpoint thermometers which had been
specially constructed for work at great elevations It is well known
that the higher one goes the lower is the temperature at which water
boils By measuring the temperature of boiling water and at the same
time the temperature of the atmosphere at any high point on a mountain
and working out a computation in relation to the boilingpoint
temperature of a given place on the sealevel one can obtain with
accuracy the difference in height between the two points
Two aneroid barometers were also carried which were specially made for
meone registering heights to 20000 feet the other to 25000 feet
Although I used these aneroids principally for differential heights
along my route as aneroids cannot always be relied upon for great
accuracy I found on checking these particular instruments with the
boilingpoint thermometers that they were always extremely accurate
This was however exceptional and it would not do for any one to rely
on aneroids alone for the exact measurement of mountain heights There
were in my outfit three artificial horizonsone with mercury the
others constructed with a plate glass The latter had a special
arrangement by which they could be levelled to a nicety I found that
for taking observations for latitude and longitude by the sun the
mercury horizon was satisfactory but when occultations had to be taken
at night the plateglass horizons were easier to work and gave a more
clearly defined reflection of stars and planets in such a bitterly cold
climate as Tibet where astronomical observations were always taken
under great difficulty The most useful instrument I carried on that
expedition was a powerful telescope with astronomical eyepiece
Necessarily I carried a great many compasses which included prismatic
luminous floating and pocket compasses Maximum and minimum
thermometers were taken along to keep a record of the daily temperature
and I also took with me a box of drawing and painting materials as well
as all kinds of instruments for mapmaking such as protractors
parallel rules tape rules section paper notebooks etc I had
watertight halfchronometer watches keeping Greenwich mean time and
three other watches In order to work out on the spot my observations
for latitude and longitude I had with me such books as Rapers
Navigation and the Nautical Almanac for the years 1897 and 1898 in
which all the necessary tables for the computations were to be found
I was provided with a light mountain tent usually called a tente
dabri it was seven feet long four feet wide and three feet high it
weighed four pounds All I needed in the way of bedding was one
camelshair blanket My clothing was reduced to a minimum My headgear
was a mere straw hat which was unfortunately destroyed at the beginning
of my journey so that I went most of the time with my head uncovered or
else wore a small cap I wore medium thick shoes without nails and
never carried a stick It was largely due to the simplicity of my
personal equipment that I was able to travel with great speed often
under trying circumstances Although the preparations for my expedition
cost me several thousand dollars I spent little money on medicines for
myself and my men in fact all they cost me was sixtytwo cents two
shillings and sixpence I am firm in the belief that any healthy man
living naturally under natural conditions and giving himself plenty of
exercise can be helped very little by drugs
I started from Naini Tal and rode to Almora 5510 feet above sealevel
the last hillstation toward the Tibetan frontier where I expected to
find European residents At this place I endeavored to obtain plucky
honest wiry healthy servants who would be ready for the sake of a
good salary and a handsome reward to brave the many discomforts
hardships and perils my expedition into Tibet was likely to involve
Scores of servants presented themselves Each one produced a certificate
with praises unbounded of all possible virtues that a servant could
possess Each certificate was duly ornamented with the signature of some
AngloIndian officereither a governor a general a captain or a
deputy commissioner What struck me mostly was that bearers of these
testimonials seemed sadly neglected by those who had been so
enthusiastically pleased with their services They all began by begging
or else asked for a loan of rupees in order to buy food clothes and
support the dear ones they would be leaving behind
I was sitting one day in the post restinghouse when an odd creature
came to offer his services Where are your certificates I asked
Sahib hum certificates ne hai Sir I have no certificates
I employed him at once His facial lines showed much more character than
I had noticed in the features of other local natives That was quite
sufficient for me I am a great believer in physiognomy and first
impressions which are to me more than any certificate in the world I
have so far never been mistaken
My new servants dress was peculiar His head was wrapped in a white
turban From under a short waistcoat there appeared a gaudy yellow and
black flannel shirt which hung outside his trousers instead of being
tucked in them He had no shoes and carried in his right hand an old
cricketstump with which he presented arms every time I came in or
went out of the room His name was Chanden Sing He was not a skilful
valet For instance one day I found him polishing my shoes with my best
hairbrushes When opening sodawater bottles he generally managed to
give you a spray bath and invariably hit you in the face with the
flying cork It was owing to one of these accidents that Chanden Sing
having hurt my eye badly was one day flung bodily out of the door
Lateras I had no more soda water leftI forgave him and allowed him
to return It was this man who turned out to be the one plucky man among
all my followers It was he who stood by me through thick and thin
during our trials in Tibet
From Almora up to what is usually called Bhot the country upon the
Himahlya slopes on the British side of the frontier our journey was
through fairly wellknown districts therefore I shall not dwell on the
first portion of our route I had some thirty carriers with me We
proceeded up and down through thick forests of pine and fir trees on
the sides of successive mountain ranges
We went through the ancient Gourkha town of Pithoragarh with its old
fort Several days later I visited the old Rajah of Askote one of the
finest princes Northern India then possessed I went to see the Raots a
strange race of savages living secluded from everybody in the forest
In a work called In the Forbidden Land a detailed description will be
found of my experiences with those strange people and also of our long
marches through that beautiful region of the lower Himahlyas
We reached at last a troublesome part of the journeya place called the
Nerpani which translated means the waterless trail Few travellers
had been as far as this point I shall not speak of the ups and down at
precipitous angles which we found upon the trail which had been cut
along the almost vertical cliff Here and there were many sections of
the trail which were built on crowbars thrust horizontally into the
rock A narrow path had been made by laying over these crowbars large
slabs of stone not particularly firm when you trod over them As you
went along this shaky path on the side of the precipice the drop down to
the river at the bottom of the cliff was often from 1800 to 2000 feet
and the path in many places not wider than six inches In other places
the Nerpani trail consisted of badly put together flights of hundreds of
steps along the face of the cliff
CHAPTER II
AN UNKNOWN PASS
It was at a place called Garbyang close to the Tibetan boundary that I
made my last preparations for my expedition into Tibet A delay at this
place was inevitable as all the passes over the Himahlya range were
closed Fresh snow was falling daily I intended to cross over by the
Lippu Pass the lowest of all in that region but having sent men to
reconnoitre I found it was impossible at that time to take up my entire
expedition even by that easier way
I had a Tibetan tent made in Garbyang Dr H Wilson of the Methodist
Evangelical Mission whom I met at this place went to much trouble in
trying to get together men for me who would accompany me over the
Tibetan border His efforts were not crowned with success The thirty
men I had taken from India refused to come any further and I was
compelled to get fresh men from this place The Shokas the local and
correct name of the inhabitants of Bhot were not at all inclined to
accompany me They knew too well how cruel the Tibetans were Many of
them had been tortured and men could be seen in Garbyang who had been
mutilated by the Tibetans Indeed the Tibetans often crossed the border
to come and claim dues and taxes and inflict punishment on the helpless
Shokas who were left unprotected by the Government of India
Illustration INVOLUNTARY TOBOGGANING
The Jong Pen of Taklakot a high official at the Tibetan frontier upon
hearing of my proposed visit sent threats that he would confiscate the
land of any man who came in my employ He sent messengers threatening to
cut off my head if I crossed the boundary and promised to flog and kill
any man who accompanied me On my side I had spies keeping me well
informed of his movements He kept on sending daily messengers with more
threats He gathered his soldiers on the Lippu Pass where he suspected
I might enter his country
Before starting with my entire expedition I took a reconnoitring trip
with only a few men in order to see what tactics I should adopt in
order to dodge the fanatical natives of the forbidden land To go and
find new ways on virgin mountains and glaciers was not easy work During
our rapid scouting journey we had a number of accidents Going over a
snowslope one day I slipped and shot down a snowslope with terrific
speed for a distance of three hundred yards just escaping getting
smashed to pieces at the end of this involuntary toboganning One of my
carriers who carried a child on the top of one of my loads had a
similar accident with the result that the child was killed
On returning to Garbyang I found that the Tibetans had tried to set the
natives against me Tibetan spies travelled daily between Taklakot and
Garbyang in order to keep the Jong Pen informed of my movements The
Jong Pen sent an impudent messenger one day to say that he had plenty
of soldiers guarding the Lippu Pass and that he would kill us all if we
came If he caught me alive he would cut off my head my body he said
he would sew in skins and fling into the river I sent a messenger back
to the Jong Pen to inform him that I was ready to start and that I
would meet him on the Lippu Pass that he had better beware and get out
of my way The messenger who brought him this news barely escaped with
his life He returned to me saying that the Jong Pen was preparing for
war that he had gathered all his soldiers on the top of a narrow pass
where they had piled up a great number of large rocks and smaller
ammunition to be rolled down upon us when we should be coming up the
mountainside
Having collected men enough after much trouble I one day unexpectedly
mustered them and that same night made a sudden start The Tibetans
suspecting that I might be leaving that day cut down the bridge over a
rapid and deep torrent forming the boundary between India and Nepal
This inconvenienced me as I had to find my way on our side of the
stream which was very rugged This gave us additional trouble Some of
the precipices we had to cross were extremely dangerous
I reached the highest village in the Himahlyas a place called Kuti at
an elevation of 12920 feet Here I hastily made my final preparations
for the last dash across the frontier Every available Shoka had joined
my party and no inducement brought more volunteers I needed two extra
men Two stray shepherds turned up half famished and naked with long
unkempt heads of hair and merely a coral necklace and a silver bangle
by way of clothing With these two men my little force was brought up to
thirty strong
One of the two shepherds interested me He was sulky He seldom uttered
a word and when he did he never spoke pleasantly He looked painfully
ill Motionless he would sometimes stare at a fixed point as if in a
trance His features were peculiarly refined and regular but his skin
had the ghastly shiny whitish tinge peculiar to lepers I paid no
special attention to him at first as I was busy with other matters but
one day while on the march I examined him carefully and discovered that
the poor fellow had indeed all the symptoms of that most terrible of all
diseases leprosy His distorted and contracted fingers with the skin
sore at the joints were a sad and certain proof I examined his feet
and found further evidence that the man was a leper
What is your name I inquired of him
Mansing he said dryly becoming immediately again absorbed in one of
his dreamy trances
In looking over my followers I was amused to see what a strange mixture
they were There were Humlis and Jumlis mountain tribesmen living near
the Tibetan border they wore their long black hair tied into small
braids and a topknot There were Tibetans Shokas Rongbas
Nepaleseall good mountaineers Then there were Chanden Sing and
Mansing belonging to the Rajiput caste There were a Brahmin two native
Christians and a Johari Then Doctor Wilson What a collection What a
confusion of languages and dialects An amusing feature of this odd
crowd was that each particular caste looked down upon all the others
This from the beginning occasioned a good deal of trouble among my
men I was glad of this as it seemed a sort of guarantee that they
would never combine against me One of the most peculiar men I had with
me was a Tibetan brigand a man with the strength of an ox His history
did not bear a close examination He had killed many people He asked to
be employed by me as he had quarrelled with his wife and refused to
live with her any longer In camp he went by the name of Daku the
brigand The son of one of the richest traders of Garbyang a young
fellow called Kachi also accompanied me He was intelligent and could
speak a few words of English I had employed him to look after the men
and to act as interpreter if necessary His uncle Dola was employed in
the capacity of valet and cook
Instead of proceeding by the Lippu Pass where the Jong Pen was waiting
for me with his men I made forced marches from Kuti in a different
direction altogether I meant to cross over by a high untrodden pass
practically unknown where no one could suspect that a caravan would
enter Tibet My men were good We marched steadily for several days over
very rough country getting higher and higher toward the eternal snows
We suffered considerably in crossing the rapid and foaming torrents
They were often quite deep and the water was so cold from the melting
snows that we were nearly frozen each time we waded through them We
crossed several large flat basins of stones and gravel which appeared
to have been lakebeds In these basins we found deltas formed by the
stream dividing in various directions We suffered tortures in crossing
barefooted one cold stream after another Some of my men narrowly
escaped frostbites and it was only after rubbing their feet violently
that the intense pain ceased and circulation was at last restored The
soles of my feet and my toes were badly cut and bruised Every stone in
the streams seemed to have a sharp edge I too suffered agony after I
had been in the water for some time Never until that day did I know
what a great comfort it was to possess a pair of warm socks The last
basin we crossed was at an elevation of 15400 feet We made our camp
there The thermometer registered a minimum temperature of 24 whereas
the maximum temperature that day was 51 Fahrenheit
One of the main drawbacks of travelling at great elevations was the want
of fuel There was not a tree not a shrub to be seen near our camp
Nature wore her most desolate and barren look Failing wood my men
dispersed to collect and bring in the dry dung of yaks ponies and
sheep to serve as fuel Kindling this was no easy matter Box after box
of matches was quickly used and our collective lungpower severely
drawn upon in blowing the unwilling sparks into a flame a few inches
high Upon this meagre fire we attempted to cook our food and boil our
water a trying process at great elevations The cuisine that night was
not of the usual excellence We had to eat everything halfcooked or
to be accurate practically uncooked The night was a bitterly cold
one and snow was falling heavily When we rose in the morning snow was
two feet deep around us The glare was painful to our eyes I mustered
my men Mansing was missing He had not arrived the previous night and
there was no sign of the man I had sent in search of him I was anxious
not only for the man but for the load he carrieda load of flour
salt pepper and five pounds of butter I feared that the poor leper
had been washed away in one of the dangerous streams He must at any
rate be suffering terribly from the cold with no shelter and no fire
It was long after sunrise when with the aid of my telescope I
discovered the rescued man and rescuer coming toward us They arrived in
camp an hour or so later Mansing had been found sound asleep several
miles back lying flat by the side of the empty butterpot He had eaten
all the butter When we discovered this every one in camp was angry The
natives valued fat and butter as helping to keep them warm when going
over those cold passes With much trouble I rescued Mansing from the
clutches of my other men who wanted to punish the poor leper severely
In order that this might not happen again I ordered Mansing to carry a
heavy load of photographic plates and instruments which I thought would
not prove quite so appetizing
While we were camping a flock of some six hundred sheep appeared and
with them some Tibetans As I had pitched my Tibetan tent they made for
it expecting to find some of their own countrymen Their confusion was
amusing when they found themselves face to face with Doctor Wilson and
myself Hurriedly removing their fur caps they laid them upon the
ground and made a comical bow They put out their tongues full length
and kept them so until I made signs that they could draw them back as I
wanted them to answer several questions This unexpected meeting with us
frightened them greatly They were trembling all over with fear After
getting as much information as they seemed to have I bought their
fattest sheep When the money was paid there was a further display of
furred tongues and more grand salaams when they departed while all
hands in my camp were busy trying to prevent our newly purchased animals
from rejoining the flock moving away from us On our next march these
animals were a great trouble We had to drag them most of the way
Kachi who had been intrusted with a stubborn strong beast which I had
specially promised my men for their dinner if they made a long march
that day was outwitted by the sheep It freed its head from the cord
with which Kachi was dragging it and cantered away full speed in the
opposite direction to the one in which we were travelling It is well
known that at great altitudes running is a painful operation for the
rarefied air makes such exertion almost suffocating Yet Kachi having
overcome his first surprise was soon chasing the escaped beast and
urged by the cheers of my other men succeeded after an exciting race
in catching the animal by its tail This feat is easier to describe than
to accomplish for Tibetan sheep have very short stumpy tails Kachi
fell to the ground exhausted but he held fast with both hands to his
capture and finally the animal was secured with ropes
Climbing over rolling ground we rose to a pass 15580 feet highover a
thousand feet higher than Pikes Peak in Colorado Then crossing a
wide flat land we followed the Kuti River with its high snowy
mountains to the west and east The line of perpetual snow was at 16000
feet the snow below this level melted daily except in a few shaded
places Red and white flowers were still to be seen though not in such
quantities as lower down We saw many pairs of small butterflies with
blackandwhite wings
After a while there was yet another bitterly cold stream to ford two
small lakes to skirt and three more deep rivers to wade with cold
water from the snows reaching up to our chests We had to make the best
way we could through a large field of ironbearing rock which so
affected my compass that for the time it became quite unreliable owing
to its deviation
Mile after mile we marched over sharp stones wading through another
troublesome delta fully a mile in width with eight streams and crossing
a flat basin of pointed pebbles At last to our great comfort we came
to smooth grassland
Here the Kuti River flowed through a large basin not unlike the one
near which we had camped the night before It looked like the bed of a
lake with high vertical rocks on the left As we went on to the
northwest the basin became wider and the Kuti River turned to the
northwest while the Mangshan River descending from the east joined
the first stream in the centre of the basin In wading through the
numerous branches of the two rivers we felt more than ever the trials
and weariness of the day before The water seemed colder than ever Our
feet were by this time in a dreadful condition bleeding and sore
because it was constantly necessary to walk barefooted rather than keep
removing our footgear every few minutes Aching and chilled we
stumbled on in and out of the water always treading it seemed on
sharply pointed stones The pain had to be borne patiently At last we
reached our campingground situated under the lee of the high chain of
mountains to the north of us and on the northern bank of the Mangshan
River Directly in front of us stood the final obstaclethe great
backbone of the Himahlyas Once across this range I should be on the
high Tibetan plateau so accurately described as the roof of the
world
CHAPTER III
A NARROW ESCAPE
From Kuti I had sent a sturdy Shoka named Nattoo to find out whether it
was possible to cross the Himahlyan chain over the high Mangshan Pass
In case of a favorable report I should be able to get several marches
into Tibet without fear of being detected I reckoned on turning the
position occupied by the force of soldiers which I was informed the Jong
Pen of Taklakot had gathered on the Lippu Pass in order to prevent my
entering his country Before the Tibetans could have time to find where
