THE FLOCKMASTER OF POISON CREEK
CHAPTER I
THE SHEEP COUNTRY
So John Mackenzie had put his foot upon the road This after he had
reasoned it out as a mathematical problem considering it as a matter
of quantities alone There was nothing in schoolteaching at sixty
dollars a month when men who had to carry a rubber stamp to sign their
names to their checks were making fortunes all around him in sheep
That was the way it looked to John Mackenzie the morning he set out
for Poison Creek to hunt up Tim Sullivan and strike him for a job
Against the conventions of the country he had struck out on foot
That also had been reasoned out in a cool and calculative way A
sheepherder had no use for a horse in the first place Secondly and
finally the money a horse would represent would buy at least twelve
head of ewes With questioning eyes upon him when he left Jasper and
contemptuous eyes upon him when he met riders in his dusty journey
John Mackenzie had pushed on his pack on his back
There was not a book in that pack John Mackenzie schoolmaster had
been a bondslave of books in that country for four obscure wellnigh
profitless years and he was done with them for a while The less a
sheepman knew about books the more he was bound to know about sheep
for sheep would be the object and aim of his existence Mackenzie knew
plenty of sheepmen who never had looked into any kind of a book but a
bankdeposit book in their lives That seemed to be education enough
to carry them very nicely along even to boost them to the state
legislature and lift one of them to the United States senate So
what was the use of worrying along on a mission of enlightenment at
sixty dollars a month
Mackenzie had not come into the West in a missionary spirit at the
beginning He had not believed the youth of that section to be in any
greater depths of ignorance than elsewhere in this more or less
favored land But from his earliest years he had entertained romantic
notions adventurous desires With his normalschool certificate in
his breast pocket tight trousers on his rather long legs a short
vest scarcely meeting them at the waistband he had traveled into the
West seeking romance alert for adventure
When he arrived at Jasper which was only the intermountain West and
far from the golden coast of his most fervid dreams he found that
adventure and romance apparently had packed up and gone elsewhere
years ahead of him There was nothing nearer either of them in Jasper
than a tame gamblingjoint in the back end of a saloon where greasy
morose sheepherders came to stake quarters on roulette and faro where
railroaders squandered away their wages leaving the grocerymen
unpaid And there was no romance for John Mackenzie in any such
proceeding as that
Simple you will see he was openfaced and guileless as the day
Farmbred rawboned slow of speech clear of eye no vices no
habits that pulled a man down unless a fondness for his briarroot
pipe might be so classed But in the way Mackenzie smoked the pipe it
was more in the nature of a sacrifice to his gods of romance than even
a mild dissipation
In the four years of his schoolteaching at Jasper Mackenzie slowly
grew out of his extreme rawness of appearance His legs hardened from
long rambles over the hills his face browned like an outdoor mans
his rustic appearance his clabberdays shyness all slowly dissolved
away But the school board was not cognizant of any physical or mental
strengthening in him He was worth sixty dollars a month to that
slowthinking body when he came to Jasper he was worth no more than
sixty dollars when he threw up the job and left
Romance and adventure had called him away to the road at last but the
romance of sheepriches the adventure of following a flock over the
sagegray hills Maybe he would find it too late even to glimpse them
when he arrived in the heart of the sheeplands perhaps times had
shifted since the heavyjowled illiterates whom he had met in Jasper
began their careers with a few pounds of dried apples and uncommon
endurance for hardships in the open fields
Simple they thought him down in Jasper in the mild simplicity of a
preacher or any man who would not fight In their classification he
was a neutral force an emasculated mild harmless creature who held
the childs view of life from much association with children He often
had heard it said
A man never could advance to notability in a community that rated him
as mildly simple he would have a hard time of it even to become
notorious Only one man there had taken an interest in him as man to
man a flockmaster who had come into that country twenty years before
a schoolteacher like himself
This man had kicked up the golden dust before Mackenzies eyes with
his tales of the romance of the range the romance of sheepriches
the quick multiplication of a band run on the increasesharing plan
This man urged Mackenzie to join him taking a band of sheep on
shares But his range was in sight of Jasper there was no romance on
his hills So Mackenzie struck out for the headwaters of Poison Creek
to find Tim Sullivan notable man among the sheeprich of his day
It was a fivedays journey on foot as he calculated itnobody in
that country ever had walked it as far as he could learnto Tim
Sullivans ranch on Poison Creek Now in the decline of the fifth day
he had come to Poison Creek a loud a rapid and boisterous stream
which a man could cross in two jumps It made a great amount of noise
in its going over the boulders in its bed as a little water in a vast
arid land probably was justified by its importance in doing It was
the first running water Mackenzie had met since leaving the Big Wind
clear as if it came unpolluted by a hoof or a hand from its mountain
source
But somewhere along its course Tim Sullivan grazed and watered forty
thousand sheep and beyond him were others who grazed and watered many
times that number Poison Creek might well enough merit its name from
the slaver of many flocks the schoolmaster thought although he knew
it came from pioneer days and was as obscure as pioneer names usually
are obscure
And some day he would be watering his thousands of sheep along its
rushing vein That was John Mackenzies intent and purpose as he
trudged the dusty miles of gray hills with their furze of gray sage
and their gray twilights which fell with a melancholy silence as
chilling as the breath of death For John Mackenzie was going into
the sheeplands to become a master He had determined it all by
mathematical rule
There was the experience to be gained first and it was cheaper to do
that at another mans expense than his own He knew how the right kind
of a man could form a partnership with a flockmaster sometimes he had
heard stories of such small beginnings leading to large ownership and
oily prosperity Jasper had examples of its own he was familiar with
them all
Some of them began as herders on the basis of half the increase from a
stated number of sheep not more than ten years past Now they looked
upon a sixtydollarsamonth schoolteacher with the eyes of
superiority as money always despises brains which it is obliged to
hire probably because brains cannot devise any better method of
finding the necessary calories than that of letting themselves out by
the month
Tim Sullivan needed herders he had advertised for them in the Jasper
paper Besides Tim had the name of a man who could see the
possibilities in another He had put more than one young fellow on the
way of success in the twenty years he had been running sheep on the
Poison Creek range But failing to land a partnership deal with
Sullivan Mackenzie was prepared to take a job running sheep by the
month Or should he find all avenues to experience at another mans
expense closed to him he was ready to take the six hundred dollars
saved out of his years of book bondage and buy a little flock of his
own Somewhere in that wide expanse of governmentowned land he would
find water and grazing and there his prosperity would increase
Sheep had visited the creek lately at the point where Mackenzie first
encountered it but there were no dusty flocks in sight billowing over
the hills Tim Sullivans house was not to be seen any more than
sheep from the highest hill in the vicinity It must be several miles
ahead of him still Mackenzie concluded remembering that Poison Creek
was long Yet he hoped he might reach it by nightfall for his feet
were growing weary of the untrodden way they had borne him for a
hundred and fifty miles more or less
He pushed on now and again crossing the broad trail left by bands of
sheep counting two or three thousand feeling the lonesomeness of the
unpeopled land softened by these domestic signs Sunset and no sight
of a house nightfall and not the gleam of a light to show him either
herders camp or permanent domicile of man
Mackenzie lingered beside the clamoring water in a little valley where
the uncropped grass was lush about his feet considering making camp
there for the night It was a pleasant place for a land so bleak even
in summer as that country of high tablelands and rolling gray hills
As he started to unsling his pack he caught the dim note of somebodys
voice raised in song and stood so hand on the strap listening
The voice was faint broken by the distance yet cheering because it
was a voice Mackenzie pressed up the hill hoping to be able to
thread the voice back to its source from that eminence As he neared
the top the voice came clearer as he paused to listen it seemed
quite close at hand It was a woman singing and this was the manner
of her song
Naafer alooone naafer alone
He promise nafer to leafe me
Nafer to leafe me alone
The valley whence came the song was quite dark below him and darker
for the indefinite blotch of something that appeared to be trees In
that grove the house that sheltered the melancholy singer must be
hidden so completely shrouded that not even a gleam of light escaped
to lead him to the door Mackenzie stood listening There was no other
sound rising from that sequestered homestead than the womans song
and this was as doleful as any sound that ever issued from human
lips
Over and over again the woman sang the three lines a silence after
the last long tremulous note which reached to the travelers heart
more eloquent in its expression of poignant loneliness than the
hopeless repetition of the song He grinned dustily as he found
himself wishing in all seriousness that somebody would take a day
off and teach her the rest of the hymn
Mackenzies bones were weary of the road hard as he tried to make
himself believe they were not and that he was a tough man ready to
take and give as it might come to him in the life of the sheeplands
In his heart he longed for a bed that night and a cup of hot coffee
to gladden his gizzard Coffee he had not carried with him much less
a coffeepot his load would be heavy enough without them he rightly
anticipated before he reached Tim Sullivans Nothing more cheering
than water out of the holes by the way had passed his lips these five
days
He could forgive the woman her song if she would supply some of the
comforts of those who luxuriated in houses for just this one night He
went on coming soon to barbed wire along the way and presently to a
gap in it that let him in among the trees which concealed the house
It was a small low cabin quite buried among the trees no light
showing as Mackenzie drew near although the voice of the woman still
rose in the plaintive monotony of her song
Mackenzie put as much noise into his arrival as was possible by
walking heavily knowing very well that a surprise by night is not a
good beginning for a claim of hospitality The woman must have heard
for her song ceased in the middle of a word At the corner of the
house Mackenzie saw a dim light falling through an open door into
which the shadow of the woman came
A little way from the door Mackenzie halted hat in hand giving the
woman good evening She stood within the threshold a few feet the
light of the lantern hanging in an angle of the wall over her bending
forward in the pose of one who listened She was wiping a plate which
she held before her breast in the manner of a shield stiffly in both
hands Her eyes were large and full of a frightened surprise her pale
yellow hair was hanging in slovenly abandon down her cheeks and over
her ears
She was a tall woman thin of frame worn and sad but with a faded
comeliness of face more intelligence apparent in it than is commonly
shown by Scandinavian women of the peasant class who share the labors
and the loads of their men on the isolated homesteads of the
Northwest She stood so leaning and staring her mouth standing open
as if the song had been frightened out so quickly that it had no time
to shut the door
Good evening madam said Mackenzie again
She came out of her paralysis of fright and surprise at the assuring
sound of his voice He drew nearer smiling to show his friendly
intention the lantern light on the close flat curls of his fair
hair which lay damp on temples and forehead
Tall after his kind was this traveler at her door spare of flesh
hollow of cheeks great of nose a seriousness in his eyes which
balanced well the marvelous tenderness of his smile Not a handsome
man but a man whose simple goodness shone in his features like a
friendly lamp The woman in the door advanced a timid step the color
deepened in her pale and melancholy face
I thought it was my man she said her voice soft and slow a
labored effort in it to speak without the harsh dialect so apparent in
her song
I am a traveler Mackenzie is my name on my way to Tim Sullivans
sheep ranch My grub has run low Id like to get some supper if you
can let me have a bite
There is not much for a gentleman to eat said she
Anything at all Mackenzie returned unslinging his pack letting it
down wearily at his feet
My man would not like it You have heard of Swan Carlson
No but Ill pay for it hell have no right to kick
You have come far if you have not heard of Swan Carlson His name is
on the wind like a curse Better you would go on sir my man would
kill you if he found you in this house
She moved a step to reach and lay the plate on a table close at hand
As she lifted her foot there was the sharp clink of metal as of a
dragging chain Mackenzie had heard it before when she stepped nearer
the door and now he bent to look into the shadow that fell over the
floor from the flaring bottom of the lantern
Madam said he indignantly amazed by the barbarous thing he beheld
does that man keep you a prisoner here
Like a dog she said nodding her untidy head lifting her foot to
show him the chain
It was a common tracechain from plow harness two of them in fact
welded together to give her length to go about her household work She
had a freedom of not more than sixteen feet one end of the chain
welded about her ankle the other set in a staple driven into a log of
the wall She had wrapped the links with cloths to save her flesh but
for all of that protection she walked haltingly as if the limb were
sore
I never heard of such inhuman treatment Mackenzie declared hot to
the bone in his burning resentment of this barbarity How long has he
kept you tied up this way
Three years now said she with a weary sigh
Its going to stop right here What did you let him treat you this
way for Why didnt some of your neighbors take a hand in it
Nobody comes she sighed shaking her head sadly The name of Swan
Carlson is a curse on the wind Nobody passes we are far from any
road that men travel your face is the first I have seen since Swan
put the chain on me like a wolf
Where does he keep his tools
Maybe in the barnI do not know Only there never is anything left
in my reach Will you set me free kind stranger
If I can find anything to cut that chain Let me have the lantern
The woman hesitated her eyes grown great with fright
My man he is the one who choked two sheepherders with his hands You
must have read in the paper
Maybe it was before my time Give me down the lantern
Swan Carlson appeared to be a man who got along with very few tools
Mackenzie could not find a coldchisel among the few broken and rusted
odds and ends in the barn although there was an anvil such as every
rancher in that country had fastened to a stump in the yard a hammer
rusting beside it on the block As Mackenzie stood considering what
could be done with the material at hand the woman called to him from
the door her voice vibrant with anxious excitement
My man will come soon she said
Mackenzie started back to the house hammer in hand thinking that he
might break the chain near her foot and give her liberty at least A
pile of logs lay in the dooryard an ax hacked into the end of one
With this tool added to the hammer he hurried to the prisoner
I think we can make it now he said
The poor creature was panting as if the hand of her man hung over her
in threat of throttling out her life as he had smothered the
sheepherders in the tragedy that gave him his evil fame Mackenzie
urged her to a chair giving her the lantern to hold and with the
edge of the ax set against a link of her chain the poll on the floor
he began hammering the soft metal against the bit
Once she put her hand on his shoulder her breath caught in a sharp
exclamation of alarm
I thought it was Swans step she whispered Listendo you hear
Theres nobody he assured her turning his head to listen the
sweat on his lean cheek glistening in the light
It is my fear that he will come too soon Strike fast good young
man strike fast
If Swan Carlson had been within half a mile he would have split the
wind to find out the cause of such a clanging in his shunned and
proscribed house and that he did not appear before the chain was
severed was evidence that he was nowhere near at hand When the cut
links fell to the floor Mrs Carlson stood the lantern down with
gentle deliberation as if preparing to enter the chamber of someone
in a desperate sickness to whom had come a blessed respite of sleep
Then she stood her lips apart her breath suspended lifting her
freed foot with a joyous relief in its lightness
Mackenzie remained on his knees at her feet looking up strangely into
her face Suddenly she bent over him clasped his forehead between her
hands kissed his brow as if he were her son A great hot tear
splashed down upon his cheek as she rose again a sob in her throat
that ended in a little moaning cry She tossed her long arms like an
eagle set free from a cramping cage her head thrown back her
streaming hair far down her shoulders There was an appealing grace in
her tall spare body a strange awakening beauty in her haggard
face
God sent you she said May He keep His hand over you wherever you
go
Mackenzie got to his feet she picked up the ax and leaned it against
the table close to her hand
I will give you eggs you can cook them at a fire she said and
bread I will give you but butter I cannot give That I have not
tasted since I came to this land four years ago a bride
She moved about to get the food walking with awkwardness on the foot
that had dragged the chain so long laughing a little at her efforts
to regain a normal balance
Soon it will pass away and I will walk like a lady as I once knew
how
But I dont want to cook at a fire Mackenzie protested I want you
to make me some coffee and fry me some eggs and then well see about
things
She came close to him her great gray eyes seeming to draw him until
he gazed into her soul
No you must go she said It will be better when Swan comes that
nobody shall be here but me
But you Why you poor thing hell put that chain on you again
knock you down for all I know and fasten you up like a beast Im
not going Ill stay right here till he comes
No shaking her head in sad earnestness better it will be for all
that I shall be here alone when he comes
Alone said he impatiently what can you do alone
When he comes said she drawing a great breath shaking her hair
back from her face her deep grave eyes holding him again in their
earnest appeal then I will stand by the door and kill him with the
ax
CHAPTER II
SWAN CARLSON
Mackenzie found it hard to bend the woman from this plan of summary
vengeance She had suffered and brooded in her loneliness so long the
cruel hand of Swan Carlson over her that her thoughts had beaten a
path to this desire This selfadministration of justice seemed now
her lifes sole aim She approached it with glowing eyes and flushed
cheeks she had lived for that hour
Harshly she met Mackenzies efforts at first to dissuade her from this
longplanned deed yielding a little at length not quite promising to
withhold her hand when the step of her savage husband should sound
outside the door
If you are here when he comes then it will do for another night if
you are gone then I will not say
That was the compromise she made with him at last turning with no
more argument to prepare his supper carrying the ax with her as she
went about the work Often she stood in rigid concentration listening
for the sound of Swans coming such animation in her eyes as a
brides might show in a happier hour than hers She sat opposite her
visitor as he made his supper on the simple food she gave him and
told him the story of her adventure into that heartless land the
axhandle against her knee
A ministers daughter educated to fit herself for a ministers wife
She had learned English in the schools of her native land as the
custom is and could speak it fairly when family reverses carried her
like a farblown seed to America She had no business training for
what should a ministers wife know of business beyond the affairs of
the parish and the economy of her own home She found therefore
nothing open to her hands in America save menial work in the
households of others
Not being bred to it nor the intention or thought of it as a future
contingency she suffered in humbling herself to the services of
people who were at once her intellectual and social inferiors The one
advantage in it was the improvement of her English speech through
which she hoped for better things in time
It was while she was still new to America its customs and social
adjustments and the shame of her menial situation burned in her soul
like a corrosive acid that she saw the advertisement of Swan Carlson
in a Swedish newspaper Swan Carlson was advertising for a wife
Beneath a handsome picture of himself he stated his desires frankly
with evident honesty in all his representations He told of his
holdings in sheep and land of his money in the bank
A dream of new consequence in this strange land came to Hertha
Jacobsen as she read the advertisement as she studied the features of
Swan Carlson his bold face looking at her from the page She had seen
men and the women of such men sharing their honors who had risen
from peasants to governors and senators to positions of wealth and
consequence in this strange land with all the romance of a tale out of
a book Perhaps fate had urged her on to this unfriendly shore only
to feed her on the bitter herbs for her purification for a better
life
The minister of her church investigated Swan Carlson and his claims
finding him all that he professed to be Hertha wrote to him in time
Swan came to visit her a tall longstriding man handsomer than his
picture in the paper handsome as a Viking lord with his proud foot on
the neck of a fallen foe
So she married him and came away with him to the sheeplands and
Swans hand was as tender of her as a summer wind It was shearing
time when they reached home Swan was with her every day for a little
while gathering his flocks from the range into the shearing sheds He
was master of more than fifteen thousand sheep
When the shearing was done and Swan had gone with his wagons to ship
the clip returning with his bankbook showing thousands in added
wealth a change came into her life so radiant with the blossoms of a
new happiness Swans big laugh was not so ready in his throat any
more his great hand seemed forgetful of its caress He told her that
the time of idling now was over she must go with him in a sheepwagon
to the range and care for her band of sheep sharing the labors of his
life as she shared its rewards
No that was not to her liking The wife of a rich man should not live
as a peasant woman dew in her draggled skirts to her knees the sun
browning her skin and bleaching her hair It was not for his woman to
give him no said Swan Be ready at a certain hour in the morning
they must make an early start for the way was long
But no she refused to take the burden of a peasant woman on her back
That was the first time Swan knocked her senseless When she
recovered the sheepwagon was rocking her in its uneasy journey to
the distant range Swans cruelties multiplied with his impatience at
her slowness to master the shepherds art The dogs were sullen
creatures unused to a womans voice unfriendly to a womans
presence Swan insisted that she lay aside her womans attire and
dress as a man to gain the goodwill of the dogs
Again she defied his authority all her refinement rising against the
degradation of her sex again Swan laid her senseless with a blow
When she woke her limbs were clad in overalls a greasy jumper was
buttoned over her breast But the dogs were wiser than their master
no disguise of mans could cover her from the contempt of their shrewd
senses They would not obey her shrilled commands
Very well said Swan if she did not have it in her to win even the
respect of a dog let her do a dogs work So he took the collies
away leaving her to range her band of sheep in terrible labor
mindwrenching loneliness over the sagegray hills Wolves grew bold
the lambs suffered When Swan came again to number her flock he
cursed her for her carelessness giving her blows which were kinder
than his words
With the first snow she abandoned her flock and fled Disgraceful as
it was for a woman to leave her man the frenzy of loneliness drove
her on With his companionship she could have endured Swans cruelty
but alone her heart was dead Three days she wandered Swan found her
after she had fallen in the snow
His great laugh woke her and she was home in this house the light of
day in her eyes Swan was sitting beside her merry in the thought of
how he had cheated her out of her intention to die like an old ewe
among the mountain drifts
She was good for nothing he said but to sit at home like a cat But
he would make sure that she sat at home to be there at his coming
and not running away from the bounty of a man who had taken a beggar
to his bosom Then he brought the chain and the anvil and welded the
redhot iron upon her limb He laughed when the smoke of her burning
flesh rose hissing laughed when he mounted his horse and rode away
leaving her in agony too great to let her die
This summer now beginning was the fourth since that melancholy day In
the time that had passed Swan had come into the ways of trouble
suffering a great drain upon his hoarded money growing as a
consequence sullen and somber in his moods No more he laughed even
the distress of his chained wife the sight of her wasting face and
body the pleading of her tortured eyes could not move his loud gales
of merriment again
Swan had killed two of his sheepherders as she had mentioned before
It grew out of a dispute over wages in which the men were right That
was the winter following her attempt to run away Swan being alone
with them upon the stormy range He declared both of them set upon him
at once like wolves and that he fought only to defend his life He
strangled them the throat of each grasped in his broad thick hand
and held them from him so stiff arms against their desperate
struggles until they sank down in the snow and died
Only a little while ago the lawyers had got him off from the charge of
murder after long delays The case had been tried in another county
for Swan Carlsons neighbors all believed him guilty of a horrible
crime no man among them could have listened to his story under oath
with unprejudiced ear The lawyers had brought Swan off for at the
end it had been his living word against the mute accusations of two
dead men There was nobody to speak for the herders so the lawyers
had set him free But it had cost him thousands of dollars and Swans
evil humor had deepened with the drain
Crazy he said of his wife a poor mad thing bent on selfdestruction
in wild and mournful ways In that Swan was believed at least Nobody
came to inquire of her none ever stopped to speak a word The nearest
neighbor was twelve or fifteen miles distant a morose man with sour
face master of a sea of sheep
All of this Swan himself had told her in the days when he laughed He
told her also of the lawyers drain upon his wealth starving her days
together to make a pebble of saving to fill the ruthless breach
Tonight Swan will come she said After what I have told you are
you not afraid
I suppose I ought to be Mackenzie returned leaving her to form her
own conclusion
She searched his face with steady eyes her hand on the axhelve in
earnest effort to read his heart
No you are not afraid she said But wait when you hear him
speak then you will be afraid
How do you know he is coming home tonight
She did not speak at once Her eyes were fixed on the open door at
Mackenzies side her face was set in the tensity of her mental
concentration as she listened Mackenzie bent all his faculties to
hear if any foot approached There was no sound
