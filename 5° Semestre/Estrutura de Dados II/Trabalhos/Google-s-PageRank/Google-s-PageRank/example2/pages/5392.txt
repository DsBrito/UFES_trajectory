I will not go mother he said If at length every man is needed that
will be different
It is for you to decide my son she answered There are many ways in
which you can serve your country here But remember that you may have to
face hard things
I have had to do that before mother he replied calmly I cannot
leave you dependent upon charity
She went back into her room to pray for she knew that he had laid his
ambition at her feet
It was not until a week later that the dreaded news came All through the
Friday shells had rained on the little fort while Charleston looked on
No surrender yet Through a wide land was that numbness which precedes
action Force of habit sent men to their places of business to sit idle
A prayerful Sunday intervened Sumter had fallen South Carolina had shot
to bits the flag she had once revered
On the Monday came the call of President Lincoln for volunteers Missouri
was asked for her quota The outraged reply of her governor went back
never would she furnish troops to invade her sister states Little did
Governor Jackson foresee that Missouri was to stand fifth of all the
Union in the number of men she was to give To her was credited in the
end even more men than stanch Massachusetts
The noise of preparation was in the cityin the land On the Monday
morning when Stephen went wearily to the office he was met by Richter
at the top of the stairs who seized his shoulders and looked into his
face The light of the zealot was on Richters own
We shall drill every night now my friend until further orders It is
the Leaders word Until we go to the front Stephen to put down
rebellion Stephen sank into a chair and bowed his head What would he
thinkthis man who had fought and suffered and renounced his native
land for his convictions Who in this nobler allegiance was ready to die
for them How was he to confess to Richter of all men
Carl he said at length II cannot go
Youyou cannot go You who have done so much already And why
Stephen did not answer But Richter suddenly divining laid his hands
impulsively on Stephens shoulders
Ach I see he said Stephen I have saved some money It shall be for
your mother while you are away
At first Stephen was too surprised for speech Then in spite of his
feelings he stared at the German with a new appreciation of his
character Then he could merely shake his head
Is it not for the Union implored Richter I would give a fortune if
I had it Ah my friend that would please me so And I do not need the
money now I havenobody
Spring was in the air the first faint smell of verdure wafted across the
river on the wind Stephen turned to the open window tears of intense
agony in his eyes In that instant he saw the regiment marching and the
flag flying at its head
It is my duty to stay here Carl he said brokenly
Richter took an appealing step toward him and stopped He realized that
with this young New Englander a decision once made was unalterable In
all his knowledge of Stephen he never remembered him to change With the
demonstrative sympathy of his race he yearned to comfort him and knew
not how Two hundred years of Puritanism had reared barriers not to be
broken down
At the end of the office the stern figure of the Judge appeared
Mr Brice he said sharply
Stephen followed him into the littered room behind the ground glass door
scarce knowing what to expectand scarce caring as on that first day
he had gone in there Mr Whipple himself closed the door and then the
transom Stephen felt those keen eyes searching him from their
hidingplace
Mr Brice he said at last the President has called for seventyfive
thousand volunteers to crush this rebellion They will go and be
swallowed up and more will go to fill their places Mr Brice people
will tell you that the war will be over in ninety days But I tell you
sir that it will not be over in seven times ninety days He brought
down his fist heavily upon the table This sir will be a war to the
death One side or the other will fight until their blood is all let and
until their homes are all ruins He darted at Stephen one look from
under those fierce eyebrows Do you intend to go sir
Stephen met the look squarely No sir he answered steadily not
now
Humph said the Judge Then he began what seemed a neverending search
among the papers on his desk At length he drew out a letter put on his
spectacles and read it and finally put it down again
Stephen said Mr Whipple you are doing a courageous thing But if we
elect to follow our conscience in this world we must not expect to
escape persecution sir Two weeks ago he continued slowly two weeks
ago I had a letter from Mr Lincoln about matters here He mentions you
He remembers me cried Stephen
The Judge smiled a little Mr Lincoln never forgets any one said he
He wishes me to extend to you his thanks for your services to the
Republican party and sends you his kindest regards
This was the first and only time that Mr Whipple spoke to him of his
labors Stephen has often laughed at this since and said that he would
not have heard of them at all had not the Judges sense of duty compelled
him to convey the message And it was with a lighter heart than he had
felt for many a day that he went out of the door
Some weeks later five regiments were mustered into the service of the
United States The Leader was in command of one And in response to his
appeals despite the presence of officers of higher rank the President
had given Captain Nathaniel Lyon supreme command in Missouri
Stephen stood among the angry jeering crowd that lined the streets as
the regiments marched past Here were the Black Jaegers No wonder the
crowd laughed Their step was not as steady nor their files as straight
as Company A There was Richter his head high his blue eyes defiant
And there was little Tiefel marching in that place of second lieutenant
that Stephen himself should have filled Here was another company and at
the end of the first four big Tom Catherwood His father had disowned
him the day before His two brothers George and little Spencer were in
a house not far awaya house from which a strange flag drooped
Clouds were lowering over the city and big drops falling as Stephen
threaded his way homeward the damp anal gloom of the weather in his very
soul He went past the house where the strange flag hung against its
staff In that big city it flaunted all unchallenged The house was thrown
wide open that day and in its window lounged young men of honored
families And while they joked of German boorishness and Yankee cowardice
they held rifles across their knees to avenge any insult to the strange
banner that they had set up In the hall through the open doorway the
mouth of a shotted field gun could be seen The guardians were the Minute
Men organized to maintain the honor and dignity of the state of
Missouri
Across the street from the house was gathered a knot of curious people
and among these Stephen paused Two young men were standing on the steps
and one was Clarence Colfax His hands were in his pockets and a
careless scornful smile was on his face when he glanced down into the
street Stephen caught that smile Anger swept over him in a hot flame
as at the slave auction years agone That was the unquenchable fire of
the war The blood throbbed in his temples as his feet obeyedand yet
he stopped
What right had he to pull down that flag to die on the pavement before
that house
CHAPTER XVII
CAMP JACKSON
What enthusiasm on that gusty Monday morning the Sixth of May 1861
Twelfth Street to the north of the Market House is full three hundred
feet across and the militia of the Sovereign State of Missouri is
gathering there Thence by order of her Governor they are to march to
Camp Jackson for a week of drill and instruction
Half a mile nearer the river on the house of the Minute Men the strange
flag leaps wildly in the wind this day
On Twelfth Street the sun is shining drums are beating and bands are
playing and bright aides dashing hither and thither on spirited
chargers One by one the companies are marching up and taking place in
line the city companies in natty gray fatigue the country companies
often in their Sunday clothes But they walk with heads erect and chests
out and the ladies wave their gay parasols and cheer them Here are the
aristocratic St Louis Grays Company A there come the Washington Guards
and Washington Blues and Laclede Guards and Missouri Guards and Davis
Guards Yes this is Secession Day this Monday And the colors are the
Stars and Stripes and the Arms of Missouri crossed
What are they waiting for Why dont they move Hark A clatter and a
cloud of dust by the market place an ecstasy of cheers running in waves
the length of the crowd Make way for the dragoons Here they come at
last four and four the horses prancing and dancing and pointing
quivering ears at the tossing sea of hats and parasols and ribbons Maude
Catherwood squeezes Virginias arm There riding in front erect and
firm in the saddle is Captain Clarence Colfax Virginia is red and
white and red againtrue colors of the Confederacy How proud she was
of him now How ashamed that she even doubted him Oh that was his true
calling a soldiers life In that moment she saw him at the head of
armies from the South driving the Yankee hordes northward and still
northward until the roar of the lakes warns them of annihilation She saw
his chivalry sparing them Yes this is Secession Monday
Down to a trot they slow Clarences black thoroughbred arching his long
neck proud as his master of the squadron which follows four and four
The square young man of bone and sinew in the first four whose horse is
built like a Crusaders is George Catherwood And Eugenie gives a cry
and points to the rear where Maurice is riding
Whose will be the Arsenal now Can the Yankee regiments with their
slouchy Dutchmen hope to capture it If there are any Yankees in Twelfth
Street that day they are silent Yes there are some And there are
some even in the ranks of this Militiawho will fight for the Union
These are sad indeed
There is another wait the companies standing at ease Some of the
dragoons dismount but not the handsome young captain who rides straight
to the bright group which has caught his eye Colonel Carvel wrings his
gauntleted hand
Clarence we are proud of you sir he says
And Virginia repeats his words her eyes sparkling her fingers
caressing the silken curve of Jeffersons neck
Clarence you will drive Captain Lyon and his Hessians into the river
Hush Jinny he answered we are merely going into camp to learn to
drill that we may be ready to defend the state when the time comes
Virginia laughed I had forgotten she said
You will have your cousin courtmartialed my dear said the Colonel
Just then the call is sounded But he must needs press Virginias hand
first and allow admiring Maude and Eugenie to press his Then he goes
off at a slow canter to join his dragoons waving his glove at them and
turning to give the sharp order Attention to his squadron
Virginia is deliriously happy Once more she has swept from her heart
every vestige of doubt Now is Clarence the man she can admire Chosen
unanimously captain of the Squadron but a few days since Clarence had
taken command like a veteran George Catherwood and Maurice had told the
story
And now at last the city is to shake off the dust of the North On to
Camp Jackson was the cry The bands are started the general and staff
begin to move and the column swings into the Olive Street road followed
by a concourse of citizens awheel and afoot the horse cars crowded
Virginia and Maude and the Colonel in the Carvel carriage and behind
Ned on the box is their luncheon in a hamper Standing up the girls can
just see the nodding plumes of the dragoons far to the front
Olive Street now paved with hot granite and disfigured by trolley wires
was a country road then Green trees took the place of crowded rows of
houses and stores and little bobtail yellow cars were drawn by
plodding mules to an inclosure in a timbered valley surrounded by a
board fence known as Lindell Grove It was then a resort a picnic
ground what is now covered by close residences which have long shown the
wear of time
Into Lindell Grove flocked the crowd the rich and the poor the
proprietor and the salesmen to watch the soldiers pitch their tents
under the spreading trees The gallant dragoons were off to the west
across a little stream which trickled through the grounds By the side of
it Virginia and Maude enchanted beheld Captain Colfax shouting his
orders while his troopers dragged the canvas from the wagons and
staggered under it to the line Alas that the girls were there The
Captain lost his temper his troopers perspiring over Gordian knots in
the ropes uttered strange soldier oaths while the mad wind which blew
that day played a hundred pranks
To the discomfiture of the young ladies Colonel Carvel pulled his goatee
and guffawed Virginia was for moving away
How mean Pa she said indignantly How car you expect them to do it
right the first day and in this wind
Oh Jinny look at Maurice exclaimed Maude giggling He is pulled
over on his head
The Colonel roared And the gentlemen and ladies who were standing by
laughed too Virginia did not laugh It was all too serious for her
You will see that they can fight she said They can beat the Yankees
and Dutch
This speech made the Colonel glance around him Then he smiledin
response to other smiles
My dear he said you must remember that this is a peaceable camp of
instruction of the state militia There fly the Stars and Stripes from
the generals tent Do you see that they are above the state flag Jinny
you forget yourself
Jinny stamped her foot
Oh I hate dissimulation she cried Why cant we say outright that
we are going to run that detestable Captain Lyon and his Yankees and
Hessians out of the Arsenal
Why not Colonel Carvel cried Maude She had forgotten that one of her
brothers was with the Yankees and Hessians
Why arent women made generals and governors said the Colonel
If we were answered Virginia something might be accomplished
Isnt Clarence enough of a fireeater to suit you asked her father
But the tents were pitched and at that moment the young Captain was seen
to hand over his horse to an orderly and to come toward them He was
followed by George Catherwood
Come Jinny cried her cousin let us go over to the main camp
And walk on Davis Avenue said Virginia flushing with pride Isnt
there a Davis Avenue
Yes and a Lee Avenue and a Beauregard Avenue said George taking his
sisters arm
We shall walk in them all said Virginia
What a scene of animation it was The rustling trees and the young grass
of early May and the two hundred and forty tents in lines of military
precision Up and down the grassy streets flowed the promenade proud
fathers and mothers and sweethearts and sisters and wives in gala dress
Wear your bright gowns now you devoted women The day is coming when you
will make them over and over again or tear them to lint to stanch the
blood of these young men who wear their new gray so well
Every afternoon Virginia drove with her father and her aunt to Camp
Jackson All the fashion and beauty of the city were there The bands
played the black coachmen flecked the backs of their shining horses and
walking in the avenues or seated under the trees were natty young
gentlemen in white trousers and brassbuttoned jackets All was not
soldier fare at the regimental messes Cakes and jellies and even ices
and more substantial dainties were laid beneath those tents Dress parade
was one long sigh of delight Better not to have been born than to have
been a young man in St Louis early in Camp Jackson week and not be a
militiaman
One young man whom we know however had little of pomp and vanity about
himnone other than the young manager some whispered silent partner
of Carvel  Company If Mr Eliphalet had had political ambition or
political leanings during the halfyear which had just passed he had
not shown them Mr Cluyme no mean business man himself had pronounced
Eliphalet a conservative young gentleman who attended to his own affairs
and let the mad country take care of itself This is precisely the wise
course Mr Hopper chose Seeing a regiment of Missouri Volunteers
slouching down Fifth street in citizens clothes he had been remarked to
smile cynically But he kept his opinions so close that he was supposed
not to have any
On Thursday of Camp Jackson week an event occurred in Mr Carvels store
which excited a buzz of comment Mr Hopper announced to Mr Barbo the
bookkeeper that he should not be there after four oclock To be sure
times were more than dull The Colonel that morning had read over some
two dozen letters from Texas and the Southwest telling of the
impossibility of meeting certain obligations in the present state of the
country The Colonel had gone home to dinner with his brow furrowed On
the other hand Mr Hoppers equanimity was spoken of at the widows
table
At four oclock Mr Hopper took an Olive Street car tucking himself
into the far corner where he would not be disturbed by any ladies who
might enter In the course of an hour or so he alighted at the western
gate of the camp on the Olive Street road Refreshing himself with a
little tobacco he let himself be carried leisurely by the crowd between
the rows of tents A philosophy of his own which many men before and
since have adopted permitted him to stare with a superior good nature at
the open lovemaking around him He imagined his own figurewhich was
already growing a little stoutin a light gray jacket and duck
trousers and laughed Eliphalet was not burdened with illusions of that
kind These heroes might have their heroworship Life held something
dearer for him
As he was sauntering toward a deserted seat at the foot of a tree it so
chanced that he was overtaken by Mr Cluyme and his daughter Belle Only
that morning this gentleman in glancing through the real estate column
of his newspaper had fallen upon a deed of sale which made him wink He
reminded his wife that Mr Hopper had not been to supper of late So now
Mr Cluyme held out his hand with more than common cordiality When Mr
Hopper took it the fingers did not close any too tightly over his own
But it may be well to remark that Mr Hopper himself did not do any
squeezing He took off his hat grudgingly to Miss Belle He had never
liked the custom
I hope you will take pot luck with us soon again Mr Hopper said the
elder gentleman We only have plain and simple things but they are
wholesome sir Dainties are poor things to work on I told that to his
Royal Highness when he was here last fall He was speaking to me on the
merits of roast beef
Its a fine day said Mr Hopper
So it is Mr Cluyme assented Letting his gaze wander over the camp
he added casually I see that they have got a few mortars and howitzers
since yesterday I suppose that is the stuff we heard so much about
which came on the Swon marked marble They say Jeff Davis sent the
stuff to em from the Government arsenal the Secesh captured at Baton
Rouge Theyre pretty near ready to move on our arsenal now
Mr Hopper listened with composure He was not greatly interested in this
matter which had stirred the city to the quick Neither had Mr Cluyme
spoken as one who was deeply moved Just then as if to spare the pains
of a reply a Jenny Lind passed them Miss Belle recognized the
carriage immediately as belonging to an elderly lady who was well known
in St Louis Every day she drove out dressed in black bombazine and
heavily veiled But she was blind As the motherinlaw of the stalwart
Union leader of the city Miss Belles comment about her appearance in
Camp Jackson was not out of place
Well she exclaimed Id like to know what shes doing here
Mr Hoppers answer revealed a keenness which in the course of a few
days engendered in Mr Cluyme as lusty a respect as he was capable of
I dont know said Eliphalet but I callate shes got stouter
What do you mean by that Miss Belle demanded
That Union principles must be healthy said he and laughed
Miss Cluyme was prevented from following up this enigma The appearance
of two people on Davis Avenue drove the veiled lady from her mind
Eliphalet too had seen them One was the tall young Captain of
Dragoons in cavalry boots and the other a young lady with dark brown
hair in a lawn dress
Just look at them cried Miss Belle They think they are alone in the
garden of Eden Virginia didnt use to care for him But since hes a
captain and has got a uniform shes come round pretty quick Im
thankful I never had any silly notions about uniforms
She glanced at Eliphalet to find that his eyes were fixed on the
approaching couple
Clarence is handsome but worthless she continued in her sprightly
way I believe Jinny will be fool enough to marry him Do you think
shes so very pretty Mr Hopper
Mr Hopper lied
Neither do I Miss Belle assented And upon that greatly to the
astonishment of Eliphalet she left him and ran towards them Virginia
she cried Jinny I have something so interesting to tell you
Virginia turned impatiently The look she bestowed upon Miss Cluyme was
not one of welcome but Belle was not sensitive Putting her arm through
Virginias she sauntered off with the pair toward the parade grounds
Clarence maintaining now a distance of three feet and not caring to hide
his annoyance
Eliphalets eyes smouldered following the three until they were lost in
the crowd That expression of Virginias had reminded him of a time
years gone when she had come into the store on her return from Kentucky
and had ordered him to tell her father of her arrival He had smarted
then And Eliphalet was not the sort to get over smarts
A beautiful young lady remarked Mr Cluyme And a deserving one Mr
Hopper Now she is my notion of quality She has wealth and manners
and looks And her father is a good man Too bad he holds such views on
secession I have always thought sir that you were singularly fortunate
in your connection with him
There was a point of light now in each of Mr Hoppers green eyes But
Mr Cluyme continued
What a pity I say that he should run the risk of crippling himself by
his opinions Times are getting hard
Yes said Mr Hopper
And southwestern notes are not worth the paper they are written on
But Mr Cluyme has misjudged his man If he had come to Eliphalet for
information of Colonel Carvels affairs or of any one elses affairs he
was not likely to get it It is not meet to repeat here the long business
conversation which followed Suffice it to say that Mr Cluyme who was
in dry goods himself was as ignorant when he left Eliphalet as when he
met him But he had a greater respect than ever for the shrewdness of the
business manager of Carvel  Company
That same Thursday when the first families of the city were whispering
jubilantly in each others ears of the safe arrival of the artillery and
stands of arms at Camp Jackson something of significance was happening
within the green inclosure of the walls of the United States arsenal far
to the southward
The days had become alike in sadness to Stephen Richter gone and the
Judge often away in mysterious conference he was left for hours at a
spell the sole tenant of the office Fortunately there was work of
Richters and of Mr Whipples left undone that kept him busy This
Thursday morning however he found the Judge getting into that best
black coat which he wore on occasions His manner had recently lost much
of its gruffness
Stephen said he they are serving out cartridges and uniforms to the
regiments at the arsenal Would you like to go down with me
Does that mean Camp Jackson asked Stephen when they had reached the
street
Captain Lyon is not the man to sit still and let the Governor take the
first trick sir said the Judge
As they got on the Fifth Street car Stephens attention was at once
attracted to a gentleman who sat in a corner with his children about
him He was lean and he had a face of great keenness and animation He
had no sooner spied Judge Whipple than he beckoned to him with a kind of
military abruptness
That is Major William T Sherman said the Judge to Stephen He used
to be in the army and fought in the Mexican War He came here two months
ago to be the President of this Fifth Street car line
They crossed over to him the Judge introducing Stephen to Major Sherman
who looked at him very hard and then decided to bestow on him a vigorous
nod
Well Whipple he said this nation is going to the devil eh
Stephen could not resist a smile For it was a bold man who expressed
radical opinions provided they were not Southern opinions in a St
Louis street car early in 61
The Judge shook his head We may pull out he said
Pull out exclaimed Mr Sherman Whos man enough in Washington to
shake his fist in a rebels face Our leniencyour timidityhas
paralyzed us sir
By this time those in the car began to manifest considerable interest in
the conversation Major Sherman paid them no attention and the Judge
once launched in an argument forgot his surroundings
I have faith in Mr Lincoln He is calling out volunteers
Seventyfive thousand for three months said the Major vehemently a
bucketful on a conflagration I tell you Whipple well need all the
water weve got in the North
The Judge expressed his belief in this and also that Mr Lincoln would
draw all the water before he got through
Upon my soul said Mr Sherman Im disgusted Nows the time to stop
em The longer we let em rear and kick the harder to break em You
dont catch me going back to the army for three months If they want me
theyve got to guarantee me three years Thats more like it Turning to
Stephen he added Dont you sign any three months contract young
man
Stephen grew red By this time the car was full and silent No one had
offered to quarrel with the Major Nor did it seem likely that any one
would
Im afraid I cant go sir
Why not demanded Mr Sherman
Because sir said the Judge bluntly his mothers a widow and they
have no money He was a lieutenant in one of Blairs companies before the
call came
The Major looked at Stephen and his expression changed
Find it pretty hard he asked
Stephens expression must have satisfied him but he nodded again more
vigorously than before
Just you WAIT Mr Brice he said It wont hurt you any
Stephen was grateful But he hoped to fall out of the talk Much to his
discomfiture the Major gave him another of those queer looks His whole
manner and even his appearance reminded Stephen strangely of Captain
Elijah Brent
Arent you the young man who made the Union speech in Mercantile Library
Hall
Yes sir said the Judge He is
At that the Major put out his hand impulsively and gripped Stephens
Well sir he said I have yet to read a more sensible speech except
some of Abraham Lincolns Brinsmade gave it to me to read Whipple that
speech reminded me of Lincoln It was his style Where did you get it
Mr Brice he demanded
I heard Mr Lincolns debate with Judge Douglas at Freeport said
Stephen beginning to be amused
The Major laughed
I admire your frankness sir he said I meant to say that its logic
rather than its substance reminded one of Lincoln
I tried to learn what I could from him Major Sherman
At length the car stopped and they passed into the Arsenal grounds
Drawn up in lines on the green grass were four regiments all at last in
the blue of their countrys service Old soldiers with baskets of
cartridges were stepping from file to file giving handfuls to the
recruits Many of these thrust them in their pockets for there were not
enough belts to go around The men were standing at ease and as Stephen
saw them laughing and joking lightheartedly his depression returned It
was driven away again by Major Shermans vivacious comments For suddenly
Captain Lyon the man of the hour came into view
Look at him cried the Major hes a man after my own heart Just look
at him running about with his hair flying in the wind and the papers
bulging from his pockets Not dignified eh Whipple But this isnt the
time to be dignified If there were some like Lyon in Washington our
troops would be halfway to New Orleans by this time Dont talk to me of
Washington Just look at him
The gallant Captain was a sight indeed and vividly described by Major
Shermans picturesque words as he raced from regiment to regiment and
from company to company with his sandy hair awry pointing
gesticulating commanding In him Stephen recognized the force that had
swept aside stubborn army veterans of wavering faith that snapped the
tape with which they had tied him
Would he be duped by the Governors ruse of establishing a State Camp at
this time Stephen as he gazed at him was sure that he would not This
man could see to the bottom through every specious argument Little
matters of law and precedence did not trouble him Nor did he believe
elderly men in authority when they told gravely that the state troops
were there for peace
After the ranks were broken Major Sherman and the Judge went to talk to
Captain Lyon and the Union Leader who was now a Colonel of one of the
Volunteer regiments Stephen sought Richter who told him that the
regiments were to assemble the morning of the morrow prepared to march
To Camp Jackson asked Stephen
Richter shrugged his shoulders
We are not consulted my friend he said Will you come into my
quarters and have a bottle of beer with Tiefel
Stephen went It was not their fault that his sense at their comradeship
was gone To him it was as if the ties that had bound him to them were
asunder and he was become an outcast
CHAPTER XVIII
THE STONE THAT IS REJECTED
That Friday morning Stephen awoke betimes with a sense that something was
to happen For a few moments he lay still in the half comprehension which
