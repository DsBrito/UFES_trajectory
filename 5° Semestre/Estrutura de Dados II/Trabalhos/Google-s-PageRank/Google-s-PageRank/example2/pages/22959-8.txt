the DemocratsFirst appearance of the slavery issue in politics

annexation and John Tyler
Through the influence of early associations I began my political
life as a Whig casting my first presidential ballot for General
Harrison in 1840  I knew next to nothing of our party politics
but in the matter of attending massmeetings singing Whig songs
and drinking hard cider I played a considerable part in the
memorable campaign of that year  So far as ideas entered into my
support of the Whig candidate I simply regarded him as a poor man
whose home was a log cabin and who would in some way help the
people through their scuffle with poverty and the hard times
while I was fully persuaded that Van Buren was not only a graceless
aristocrat and a dandy but a cunning conspirator seeking the
overthrow of his countrys liberties by uniting the sword and the
purse in his own clutches as he was often painted on the party
banners  In these impressions I was by no means singular  They
filled the air and seemed to be wafted on every breeze  Horace
Greeleys famous campaign organ The Log Cabin only gave them
voice and fitting pictorial effect and he frankly admitted in
later years that his Whig appeals with his music and wood engravings
of General Harrisons battle scenes were more vivid than sedately
argumentative  No one will now seriously pretend that this was
a campaign of ideas or a struggle for political reform in any
sense  It was a grand national frolic in which the imprisoned
mirth and fun of the people found such jubilant and uproarious
expression that anything like calmness of judgment or real seriousness
of purpose was out of the question in the Whig camp
As regards party issues General Harrison singularly enough was
not a Whig but an old fashioned StatesRights Democrat of the
Jeffersonian school  His letters to Harmar Denny and Sherrod
Williams committed him to none of the dogmas which defined a Whig
No authentic utterance of his could be produced in which he had
ever expressed his agreement with the Whig party on the questions
of a protective tariff internal improvements or a national bank
There was very high Whig authority for saying that the bank question
was not an issue of the canvass while Van Burens great measure
for separating the currency from the banks became a law pending
the Presidential struggle  In fact it was because no proof of
General Harrisons party orthodoxy could be found that he was
nominated and the Whig managers of the Harrisburg Convention felt
obliged to sacrifice Henry Clay which they did through the basest
doubledealing and treachery for the reason that his right angled
character as a party leader would make him unavailable as a candidate
As to John Tyler he was not a Whig in any sense  It is true that
he had opposed the removal of the deposits and voted against
Bentons expunging resolutions but on all the regular and recognized
party issues he was fully committed as a Democrat and was moreover
a nullifier  The sole proof of his Whiggery was the apocryphal
statement that he wept when Clay failed to receive the nomination
while his political position was perfectly understood by the men
who nominated him  There was one policy only on which they were
perfectly agreed and that was the policy of avowing no principles
whatever and they tendered but one issue and that was a change
of the national administration  On this issue they were perfectly
united and thoroughly in earnest and it was idle to deny that on
their own showing the spoils alone divided them from the Democrats
and inspired their zeal
The demand of the Whigs for a change was wellfounded  Samuel
Swartwout the New York Collector of Customs had disgraced the
Government by his defalcations and although he was a legacy of
Mr Van Burens illustrious predecessor and had been vindicated
by a Senate committee composed chiefly of his political opponents
he was unquestionably a public swindler and had found shelter
under Mr Van Burens administration  He was the most conspicuous
public rascal of his time but was far from being alone in his
odious notoriety  The system of public plunder inaugurated by
Jackson was in full blast and an organized effort to reform it
was the real need of the hour but here was the weak point of the
Whigs  They proceeded upon the perfectly gratuitous assumption
that the shameless abuses against which they clamored would be
thoroughly reformed should they come into power  They took it for
granted that a change would be equivalent to a cure and that the
people would follow them in thus begging the very question on which
some satisfactory assurance was reasonably required  They seemed
totally unconscious of the fact that human nature is essentially
the same in all parties and that a mere change of men without any
change of system would be fruitless  They laid down no programme
looking to the reform of the civil service  They did not condemn
it and their sole panacea for the startling frauds and defalcations
of Van Burens administration was the imagined superior virtue and
patriotism of the Whigs  In the light of this fact alone it is
impossible to account for the perfectly unbounded and irrepressible
enthusiasm which swept over the land during the campaign and so
signally routed the forces of Democracy  Something more than empty
promises and windy declamation was necessary and that something
in an evil hour was supplied by the Democrats themselves
General Harrison was a man of Revolutionary blood  He commanded
the confidence of the chief Fathers of the Republic  He was a man
of undoubted bravery and had made a most honorable record both
as a soldier and a civilian upon ample trial in both capacities
He was unquestionably honest and patriotic and the fact that he
was a poor man and a plain farmer of the West could properly form
no objection to his character or his fitness for the Presidency
But the Democratic orators and newspapers assailed him as an
imbecile  They called him a dotard and a granny  They said
he had distinguished himself in war by running away from the enemy
One Democratic journalist spoke of him contemptuously as a man
who should be content with a log cabin and a barrel of hard cider
without aspiring to the Presidency  The efforts to belittle his
merits and defile his good name became systematic and degenerated
into the most unpardonable personal abuse and political defamation
This was exactly what the Whigs needed to supplement their lack of
principles  It worked like a charm  It rallied the Whig masses
like a grand battlecry  Massmeetings of the people such as had
never been dreamed of before became the order of the day  The
people took the work of politics into their own keeping and the
leaders became followers  The first monster meeting I attended
was held on the Tippecanoe battleground on the 29th and 30th of
May  In order to attend it I rode on horseback through the mud
and swamps one hundred and fifty miles but I considered myself
amply compensated for the journey in what I saw and enjoyed  The
gathering was simply immense and I remember that James Brooks
since conspicuous in our national politics tried to address the
multitude from the top of a huge log cabin  Large shipments of
hard cider had been sent up the Wabash by steamer and it was
liberally dealt out to the people in gourds as more appropriate
and oldfashioned than glasses  The people seemed to be supremely
happy and their faces were so uniformly radiant with smiles that
a man who was detected with a serious countenance was at once
suspected as an unrepentant Locofoco  But by far the largest
meeting of the campaign was that held at Dayton on the 12th day
of September where General Harrison spoke at length  He was the
first great man I had seen and while gazing into his face with
an awe which I have never since felt for any mortal I was suddenly
recalled from my rapt condition by the exit of my pocketbook
The number in attendance at this meeting was estimated at two
hundred thousand and I think it could not have been far out of
the way  I am sure I have never seen it equaled although I have
witnessed many great meetings within the past forty years  The
marked peculiarity of all the gatherings of this campaign was a
certain grotesque pomp and extravagance of representation suggestive
of a grand carnival  The banners devices and pictures were
innumerable while huge wagons were mounted with log cabins cider
barrels canoes miniature ships and raccoons
But the most distinguishing feature of the campaign was its music
The spirit of song was everywhere and made the whole land vocal
The campaign was set to music and the song seriously threatened
to drown the stump speech  Whiggery was translated into a tune
and poured itself forth in doggerel rhymes which seemed to be born
of the hour and exactly suited to the crisis  I give a few
specimens partly from memory and partly from The Harrison and
Log Cabin Song Book of 1840 a copy of which is before me
What has caused the great commotion motion motion
Our country through
It is the ball arolling on on
For Tippecanoe and Tyler tooTippecanoe and Tyler too
And with them well beat little Van Van Van
Van is a used up man
And with them well beat little Van
Like the rushing of mighty waters waters waters
On it will go
And in its course will clear the way
For Tippecanoe and Tyler tooTippecanoe and Tyler too
And with them well beat little Van Van Van
Van is a used up man
And with them well beat little Van
The famous ball alluded to in this song originated with the Whigs
of Allegheny County Pennsylvania and was sent by them to a Mass
Convention held at Baltimore  It was ten or twelve feet in diameter
and upon the ends of it on blue ground were stars corresponding
in number with the States of the Union  On its wide spaces of red
and white stripes various inscriptions were made including the
following which belongs to the poetry and music of the campaign
With heart and soul
This ball we roll
May times improve
As on we move
This Democratic ball
Set rolling first by Benton
Is on another track
From that it first was sent on
Farewell dear Van
Youre not our man
To guide the ship
Well try old Tip
The following sung to the tune of Old Rosin the Bow was quite
as popular
Come ye who whatever betide her
To Freedom have sworn to be true
Prime up with a cup of hard cider
And drink to old Tippecanoe
On top Ive a cask of as good sir
As man from the tap ever drew
No poison to cut up your blood sir
But liquor as pure as the dew
Parched corn men cant stand it much longer
Enough is as much as well bear
With Tip at our head in October
Well tumble Van out of the chair
Then ho for March fourth fortyone boys
Well shout till the heavens arched blue
Shall echo hard cider and fun boys
Drink drink to old Tippecanoe
The following kindred verses will be familiar to everybody who
remembers the year 1840
Ye jolly young lads of Ohio
And all ye sick Vanocrats too
Come out from among the foul party
And vote for old Tippecanoe
Good men from the Van jacks are flying
Which makes them look kinder askew
For they see they are joining the standard
With the hero of Tippecanoe
They say that he lived in a cabin
And lived on old cider too
Well what if he did  Im certain
Hes the hero of Tippecanoe
I give the following verses of one of the best which used to be
sung with tremendous effect
The times are bad and want curing
They are getting past all enduring
Let us turn out Martin Van Buren
And put in old Tippecanoe
The best thing we can do
Is to put in old Tippecanoe
Its a business we all can take part in
So let us give notice to Martin
That he must get ready for sartin
For well put in old Tippecanoe
The best thing we can do
Is to put in old Tippecanoe
Weve had of their humbugs a plenty
For now all our pockets are empty
Weve a dollar now where we had twenty
So well put in old Tippecanoe
The best thing we can do
Is to put in old Tippecanoe
The following verses are perfectly characteristic
See the farmer to his meal
Joyfully repair
Crackers cheese and cider too
A hard but homely fare
Martin to his breakfast comes
At the hour of noon
Sipping from a china cup
With a golden spoon
Martins steeds impatient wait
At the palace door
Outriders behind the coach
And lackeys on before
After the State election in Maine a new song appeared which at
once became a favorite and from which I quote the following
And have you heard the news from Maine
And what old Maine can do
She went hell bent for Governor Kent
And Tippecanoe and Tyler too
And Tippecanoe and Tyler too
Such was this most remarkable Whig campaign with its monster
meetings and music its infinite drolleries its rollicking fun
and its strong flavor of political lunacy  As to the canvass of
the Democrats the story is soon told  In all points it was the
reverse of a success  The attempt to manufacture enthusiasm failed
signally  They had neither fun nor music in their service and
the attempt to secure them would have been completely overwhelmed
by the flood on the other side  It was a melancholy struggle and
constantly made more so by the provoking enthusiasm and unbounded
good humor of the Whigs  It ended as a campaign of despair while
its humiliating catastrophe must have awakened inexpressible
disappointment and disgust both among the leaders and masses of
the party
This picture of party politics fortythree years ago is not very
flattering to our American pride but it simply shows the working
of Democratic institutions in dealing with the raw material of
society and life at that time  The movement of 1840 was necessarily
transient and provisional while underneath its clatter and nonsense
was a real issue  It was unrecognized by both parties but it made
its advent and the men who pointed its way quietly served notice
upon the country of their ulterior purposes
As long ago as the year 1817 Charles Osborn had established an
antislavery newspaper in Ohio entitled The Philanthropist
which was followed in 1821 by the publication of Benjamin Lundys
Genius of Universal Emancipation  In 1831 the uprising of slaves
in Southampton County Virginia under the lead of Nat Turner
had startled the country and invited attention to the question of
slavery  In the same year Garrison had established The Liberator
and in 1835 was mobbed in Boston and dragged through its streets
with a rope about his neck  In 1837 Lovejoy had been murdered in
Alton Illinois and his assassins compared by the Mayor of Boston
to the patriots of the Revolution  In 1838 a proslavery mob had
set fire to Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia and defied the city
authorities in this service of slavery  President Jackson and Amos
Kendall his Postmaster General had openly set the Constitution
at defiance by justifying the rifling of the mails and the suppression
of the circulation of antislavery newspapers in the South  The
gag resolutions had been introduced in the House of Representatives
in 1836 which provoked the splendid fights of Adams Giddings and
Slade for the right of petition and the freedom of speech  Dr
Channing had published his prophetic letter to Henry Clay on the
annexation of Texas in 1837 and awakened a profound interest in
the slavery question on both sides of the Atlantic  We had been
disgraced by two Florida wars caused by the unconstitutional
espousal of slavery by the General Government  President Van Buren
had dishonored his administration and defied the moral sense of
the civilized world by his efforts to prostitute our foreign policy
to the service of slavery and the slave trade  In February 1839
Henry Clay had made his famous speech on Abolitionism and thus
recognized the bearing of the slavery question upon the presidential
election of the following year  The Abolitionists had laid siege
to the conscience and humanity of the people and their moral
appeals were to be a wellspring of life to the nation in its final
struggle for selfpreservation but as yet they had agreed upon no
organized plan of action against the aggressions of an institution
which threatened the overthrow of the Union and the end of Republican
government  But now they were divided into two camps the larger
of which favored political action organized as a party and
nominated as its candidate for President James G Birney who
received nearly seven thousand votes
This was a small beginning but it was the beginning of the end
That slavery was to be put down without political action in a
government carried on by the ballot was never a tenable proposition
and the inevitable work was at last inaugurated  It was done
opportunely  Harrison and Van Buren were alike objectionable to
antislavery men who understood their record  To choose between
them was to betray the cause  Van Buren had attempted to shelter
the slave trade under the national flag  He had allied himself to
the enemies of the right of petition and the freedom of debate as
the means of conciliating the South  He had taken sides with
Jackson in his lawless interference with the mails at the bidding
of slaveholders  In a word he had fairly earned the description
of a Northern man with Southern principles  General Harrison
on the other hand was a proslavery Virginian  While Governor of
Indiana Territory he had repeatedly sought the introduction of
slavery into that region through the suspension of the ordnance of
1787 which had forever dedicated it to freedom  He had taken
sides with the South in 1820 on the Missouri question  He had no
sympathy with the struggle of Adams and his associates against
the gag and in favor of the right of petition and regarded the
discussion of the slavery question as unconstitutional  The first
