CHAPTER I
HOW RICHARD BEGAN TO WOO
On this faraway November morning it being ten by every steeple clock
and an hour utterly chaste there could have existed no impropriety in
ones having had a look into the rooms of Mr Richard Storms said rooms
being secondfloor front of the superfashionable house of Mr Lorimer
Gwynn Washington North West Richard wrapped to the chin in a
bathrobe was sitting much at his ease having just tumbled from the
tub There was ever a recess in Richards morning programme at this
point during which his breakfast arrived Pending that repast he had
thrown himself into an easychair before the blaze which crackled in the
deep fireplace The sudden sharp weather made the fire pleasant enough
The apartment in which Richard lounged and the rooms to the rear
belonging with it were richly appointed A fortune had been spilled to
produce those effects in velvets and plushes and pictures and bronzes
and crystals and chinas and lamps and Russia leathers and laces and
brocades and silks and as you walked the thick rugs you made no more
noise than a ghost It was Richards caprice to have his environment the
very lap of splendor being as given to luxury as a woman
Against the pane beat a swirl and white flurry of snow for winter broke
early that year Richard turned an eye of gray indolence on the window
The downcome of snow in no sort disquieted him there abode a bent for
winter in his blood throughout the centuries Norse that would have
liked a Laplander Even his love for pictures ran away to scenes of snow
and windwhipped wolds with drifts piled high These if well drawn he
would look at while he turned his back on palms and jungles and things
tropical in paint the sight of which made him perspire like a harvest
hand As Richards idle glance came back from the window it caught the
brown eyes of Mr Pickwick considering him through a silvery fringy
thicket of hair Mr Pickwick was said to be royally descended however
that might have been indubitably his pedigree harbored somewhere both a
doormat and a mop
Rats observed Richard to Mr Pickwick
Richard did not say this because it was true but to show Mr Pickwick
that the ties which bound them were friendly On his side Mr Pickwick
albeit he stood well aware how there was never a rat in the room arose
vivaciously and went snuffling and scuffling behind curtains and beneath
sofas and all in a mood prodigiously dire
The room being exhaustively searched Mr Pickwick came and sat by
Richard and with yelp and howl and at intervals a little epileptic
bark proceeded to disparage all manners and septs of rats and spake
slightingly of all such vermin deer Having freed his mind on the
important subject of rats Mr Pickwick returned to silence and his
cushion and curled up
Matzai the Japanese valet brought in the breakfaststeak potatoes
eggs toast marmalade and coffee The deft Matzai placed the tray on
the mahogany at Richards elbow Richard did not like a multiplicity of
personal attendants Of the score of souls within the walls of that
house Richard would meet only Mr Gwynn and Matzai This was as the
wisdom of Solomon since neglect is born of numbers
Mr Lorimer Gwynn was a personageclean and tall and slim and solemn
and sixty years of age He was as wholly English as Mr Pickwick was
wholly Skye and exuded an indomitable respectability from his formal
shaven face Rumor had it that Mr Gwynn was fabulously rich
It was in June when Mr Gwynn came to town and leased the house just
vacated by Baron Trenk late head of the Austrian diplomatic corps This
leasing of itself half established Mr Gwynn in a highest local esteem
his being English did the rest since in the Capital of America it is
better socially to come from anywhere rather than from home In
addition to those advantages of Baron Trenks house and an English
emanation Mr Gwynn made his advent indorsed to the Washington banks by
the Bank of England also he was received by the British Ambassador on
whom he made a call of respect the moment he set foot in town
It became known that Mr Gwynn was either widower or bachelor and at
that coupled with his having taken a large house the hope crept about
that in the season he would entertain The latter thought addressed
itself tenderly to the local appetite which was ready to be received
wherever there abode good cooks and sound wines Mr Gwynn it should be
mentioned was duly elected a member of the Metropolitan Clubwhere he
never went as was likewise Richardwho was seen there a great deal
Richard had not come to town until both Mr Gwynn and his house were
established When he did appear it was difficult for the public to fix
him in his proper place He was reserved and icily taciturn and that
did not blandly set his moderate years with no friends and few
acquaintances he seemed to prefer his own society to that of whomsoever
came about him
Who was he
What was he
What were his relations with Mr Gwynn
Surely Richard could be neither son nor nephew of that English
gentleman Richard was too obviously the American of full blood his
high cheekbones square jaw and lean curved nose told of two centuries
of Western lineage Could it be that Richard was Mr Gwynns secretary
This looked in no wise probable he went about too much at lordly ease
for that In the end the notion obtained that Richard must be a needy
dependent of Mr Gwynn and his perfect clothes and the thoroughbred
horse he rode were pointed to as evidences of that gentlemans
generosity Indeed Mr Gwynn was much profited in reputation thereby
Richard while not known was not liked He wore the air of one
selfcentered and cold to all judgments except his own This last makes
no friends but only enemies for him whose position is problematical
Richards pose of insolent indifference would have been beautiful in a
gentleman who counted his fortune by millions in a dollarless beggar
who lived off alms it was detestable Wherefore the town so far as
Richard encountered it left our silent supercilious one to himself
which neglect dovetailed with his humor and was the precise lonely thing
he sought This gave still further edge to the publics disregard no
one likes you to accept with grace what is intended for punishment
Matzai carried away the breakfast tray and Richard lighted a cigar
Matzai returned and stood mute inside the door awaiting new commands
Richard pointed through the cigarsmoke to the clockone of those
soundless curious creatures of brass and glass and ivory which is wound
but once in four hundred days and of which the hairhung pendulum
twists and turns and does not swing
In an hour Eleven oclock said Richard
At the risk of shaking him in general standing it should be called to
your notice that Richard preceded breakfast with no strong waters
Richard would drink nothing more generous than coffee and speaking in
the sense limited tobacco was his only vice Perhaps he stuck to cigars
to retain his hold on earth and avoid translation before his hour was
ripe
It was no pale morality that got between Richard and the wine cup In
another day at college he had emptied many But early in his twenties
Richard discovered that he carried his drink uneasily it gave a Gothic
cant to his spirit which under its warm spell turned warlike Once
having sat late at dinnerthis was in that seminary town in France
where he attended schoolhe bestrode a certain iron lion the same
strange to him and guarding the portals of a public building Being thus
happily placed he drew two huge American sixshooters whereof his
possession was wrapped in mystery even to himself and blazed vacuously
yet ferociously at the moon Spoken to by the constabulary who came
flying to the spot Richard replied with acrimony
If you interfere with me remarked Richard on that explosive occasion
addressing the French constables Ill buy your town and burn it The
last with a splendid disdain of limitations that was congenital
Exploits similar to the above taught Richard the futility of alcoholic
things and thereupon he cultivated a Puritan sobriety upon coffee and
tobacco
Richard cast the halfburned cigar into the fire Stepping to the
mantel he took from it a small metal casket builded to hold jewels
What should be those gems of price which the metal box protected
Richard did not strike one as the man to nurse a weakness for barbaric
adornment A bathrobe is not a costume calculated to teach one the
wearers fineness To say best a bathrobe is but a savage thing It is
the garb most likely to obscure and set backward even a Walpole or a
Chesterfield in any impression of gentility In spite of this primitive
regalia however Richard gave forth an idea of elevation and as though
his ancestors in their civilization had long ago climbed above a level
where men put on gold to embellish their worth What then did that
casket of carved bronze contain
Richard took from its velvet interior the heel of a womans shoe and
kissed it It was a little kissable heel elegant in fashion one could
tell how it belonged aforetime to the footwear of a beautiful girl
Perhaps this thought was aided by the reverent preoccupation of Richard
as he regarded it for he set the bootheel on the table and hung over
it in a rapt way that had the outward features of idolatry It was right
that he should the little heel spoke of Richards first strong passion
You will retrace the year to the 10th of June Richard after roving the
Eastern earth for a decade had just returned to his own land which he
hardly knew Throughout those ten years of long idling from one European
city to another had Richard met the woman he might love he would have
laid siege to her conquered her and brought her home as his wife But
his instinct was too tribal too American Whether it were Naples or
Paris or Vienna or St Petersburg or Berlin those women whom he met
might have pleased him in everything save wedlock In London and for a
moment Richard saw a girl he looked at twice But she straightway drank
beer with the gusto of a bargeman and the vision passed
It was the evening after his return and Richard at the Waldorf sat
amusing himself with those tides of vulgar humanity that ebb and flow in
a stretch of garish corridor known as Peacock Lane Surely it was a
hopeless place wherein to seek a wife and Richard had no such thought
But who shall tell how and when and where his fate will overtake him
Who is to know when Satanor a more benevolent spiritwill be hiding
behind the hedge to play good folk a marriage trick And Richard had
been warned Once in Calcutta price one rupee a necromancer after
fullest reading of the signs informed him that when he met the woman who
should make a wife to him she would come upon him suddenly Wherefore
he should have kept a brighter watch expecting the unexpected
Richards gaze went following two rustical peopleclearly bride and
groom In a cloudy way he loathed the groom and was foggily wondering
why His second thought would have told him that the male of his
speciessuch is his sublime egotismfeels cheated with every wedding
not his own and for an earliest impulse on beholding a woman with
another man would tear her from that other one by force Thus did his
skinclad ancestors when time was
However Richard had but scanty space wherein either to enjoy his blunt
hatred of that bridegroom or theorize as to its roots His ear caught a
muffled scream and then down the wide staircase in front of him a
winsome girl came tumbling
With a dexterity born of a youth more or less replete of football
Richard sprang forward and caught the girl in his arms He caught and
held her as though she were featherlight and that feat of a brutal
strength even through her fright worked upon the saved one who
remembering her one hundred and thirty pounds did not think herself
down of thistles
Are you hurt asked Richard still holding her lightly close
Richard looked at the girl black hair white skin lashes of ink eyes
of blue roseleaf lips teeth white as rice a spot of red in her
cheeksthe last the fruit of fright no doubt He had never seen aught
so beautiful Even while she was in his arms the face fitted into his
heart like a picture into its frame and Richard thought on that prophet
of Calicut
Are you injured he asked again
Thanks to youno said the girl
With a kind of modest energy she took herself out of his arms for
Richard had held to her stoutly and might have been holding her until
now had she not come to her own rescue For all that she had leisure to
admire the steellike grasp and the deep even voice Her own words as
she replied came in gasps
No she repeated Im not injured Help me to a seat
The beautiful rescued one limped and Richard turned white
Your ankle he exclaimed
No my heel she retorted with a little flutter of a laugh My French
heel caught on the stair it was torn away No wonder I limp
Then came the girls mother and called her Dorothy
Richard who was not without presence of mind climbed six steps and
secretly made prize of the baby bootheel Perhaps you will think he did
this on the argument by which an Indian takes a scalp Whatever the
argument he placed the sweet trophy over that heart which held the
picture of the girl once there the bootheel showed bulgingly foolish
through his coat
Richard returned to the mother and daughter the latter had regained her
poise He introduced himself Mr Richard Storms The mother gave him
her card Mrs John Harley She added
My name is HanwayHarley and this is my daughter Dorothy Harley
Hanway is my own family name I always use it Then she thanked Richard
for his saving interference in her childs destinies Just to think
she concluded and a curdling horror gathered in her tones Dorothy
you might have broken your nose
Richard ran a glance over Mrs HanwayHarley She was not coarse but
was superficiala woman of inferior ideals He marveled how a being so
fine as the daughter could have had a no more silken source and hugged
the bootheel The daughter was a flower the mother a weed He decided
that the superiority of Dorothy was due to the father and gave that
absent gentleman a world of credit without waiting to make his
acquaintance
Mrs HanwayHarley said that she lived in Washington Where did Mr
Storms live
My home has been nowhere for ten years returned Richard Then as he
looked at Dorothy while his heart took a firmer grip on the picture
But I shall live in Washington in a few months
Dorothy the saved beneath whose bootheel beat Richards heart looked
up and in the blue depthsso Richard thoughtshone pleasure at the
news He could not be certain for when the blue eyes met the gray ones
they fell to a furtive consideration of the floor
You are to take a house in Washington said Richard to Mr Gwynn an
hour later
Mr Gwynn bowed
You who read will now come back to that snowfilled day in November
Richard relocked his dear bootheel in the casket eleven and Matzai had
entered the room together Matzai laid out Richards clothes down to
pin and puff tie Richard shook off his bathrobe skin and shone forth in
a sleeveless undershirt and a pair of those cotton trousers cut short
above the knee which dramatic usage ascribes to fishermen and
buccaneers
As Richard stood erect shoulders wide as a vikings chest arched like
the deck of a whaleback he might have been a model for the Farnese
Hercules if that demigod were slimmed down by training and ten years
off his age He of Farnese should be about forty if one may go by
looks while Richard was but thirty Also Richards arms muscled to
the wrists and as long as a Picts would have been out of drawing from
standpoints of ancient art One must rescue Richards head it was not
that nubbin of a head which goes with the Farnese one Moreover it
showed wisest balance from base to brow with the face free of beard and
mustache while the yellow hair owned no taint of curlaltogether an
American head on Farnese shoulders refined
Richard made no speed with his dressing What with refusing several
waistcoatsa fastidiousness which opened the slant eyes of Matzai
being unusualand what with pausing to smoke a brooding cigar it stood
roundly twelve before he was ready for the street One need not call
Richard lazy He was no one to retire or to rise with the birds why
should he Early to bed and early to rise is a tradition of the
copybooks It did well when candlelight was cheap at a dollar the dozen
but should not belong to a day of electricity no dearer than the sun
Before going out Richard crossed to a writing cabinet and pressed a
button the white disk whereof showed in its mahogany side It was not
the bell he used for the wheathued Matzai and owned a note peculiar to
itself As though in response came Mr Gwynn irreproachable austere
Upon the advent of Mr Gwynn one might have observed sundry amazing
phenomena innocent at that Mr Gwynn did not sit down but stood in
the middle of the room On the careless other hand Richard did not
arise from the chair into which he had flung himself but sat with his
hat on puffing blue wreaths and tapping his foot with a rattan
Mr Gwynn quoth Richard you will catch the fouroclock limited to
New York Talon  Trehawke Attorneys Temple Court have on sale a
majority of the stock of the Daily Tory Buy it notify those in
present charge of the editorial and business departments of the new
proprietorship There will be no changes in the personnel of the paper
so far as refers to New York You are to say however that you will
give me charge in Washington Talon  Trehawke can put you in control
and fortyeight hours should be enough to carry out my plans The
balance of the stock you will buy up at your leisure This is Tuesday
have the bureau here ready for me by Thursday evening
Mr Gwynn inclined his head
Can you give me sir some notion of what Talon  Trehawke are to
have asked Mr Gwynn
Their letter addressed to youhere it issays that sixty per cent of
the stock can be had for two millions eight hundred thousand
Very good sir and Mr Gwynn bowed deeply
Richard pulled on his gloves to depart whereat Mr Pickwick yelped
frantically from his cushion Richard tapped Mr Pickwick with the
lacquered rattan
Old man said Richard I am going to take a look at the lady I love
Mr Pickwick moaned querulously while Richard sought the street
Richard the day before dispatched a note and a card to Mrs
HanwayHarley and had been told in reply that he might call today at
three Richard decided to repair to the club and wait for three
oclock
Richard during his week in Washington had found a deserted corner in
the club and preempted it At those times when he honored the club with
his presence he occupied this vantage point From it he was given both
a view of the street and a fair survey of the apartment itself No one
approached him his atmosphere was repellant beyond civil nods
curtailed to the last limit of civility his intercourse with his
fellows had not advanced
On this afternoon as Richard smoked a solitary cigar and reviewed the
thin procession of foot passengers trudging through the snow beneath his
window he was attracted by the loud talk of a coterie about a table
The center of the group was Count Storria giant Russ This Storri did
not belong to the Russian legation did not indeed reside in town and
had been vouched into the club by one of his countrymen He had onyx
eyes with blueblack beard and mustaches which half covered his face
and hair as raven as his beard Also he valued himself for that a
favorite dish with him was raw meat chopped fine with peppers and oil
Storris educationwhich was widedid not suffice to cover up in him
the barbarian videlicet the Tartarwhich was wider and when a trifle
uplifted of drink it was his habit to brag profoundly in purring
snarling halfchallenging tones Storri boasted most of his thews
which would not have disgraced Goliath He was at the moment telling a
knot of gaping youngsters of monstrous deeds of strength Storri had
crushed horseshoes in his hand he had rolled silver pieces into bullets
between thumb and finger
See you children I will show what a Russian can do cried Storri
Storri came over to the fireplace the rest at his heels Taking up the
pokera round halfinch rod of wrought ironhe seized it firmly by one
end with his left hand and with the right wound it twice about his left
arm The black spiral reached from hand to elbow when he withdrew his
arm the club poker was a Brobdingnagian corkscrew
The youngsters stared wonderbitten Then a mighty chatter of
compliments broke forth and Storri swelled with the savage glory of his
achievement
Richard the somber who did not like noise shrugged his shoulders
Storri by the fireplace caught the shrug and found it offensive He
made towards Richard and offered the right hand his white teeth
gleaming in a sinister way through the fastnesses of his beard
Will you try grips with me cried Storri loudly Will you shake hands
Russian fashion
No retorted Richard all ice and unconcern I will not shake your
hand Russian fashion
Storri broke into an evil grin that made him look like a black panther
Some day you must put your fingers into that trap said he opening
and closing his broad hand
Richard making no return Storri and the others went back to their
decanters
Richard might have said and would have believed that he did not like
Storri because of a Siberian rudeness and want of breeding It is to be
thought however that his antipathy arose rather from having heard the
day before Storris name coupled with that of Dorothy Harley The Russ
was a caller at the Harley house it seemed and rumor gave it that he
and Mr Harley were together in speculations At that Richard hated
Storri with the dull integrity of a healthy normal animal just as he
would have hated any man who raised his eyes to Dorothy Harley for you
are to know that Richard was in a last analysis even more savage than
was Storri himself and withal as jealously hot as a coal of fire
Presently Storri departed and Richard forgot him in a reverie of smoke
It stood the quarter of three and Richard took up his walk to the
Harleys It was no mighty journey being but two blocks
In the Harley drawing room whom should Richard meet but Storri The Russ
was on the brink of departure At that meeting Richards face clouded
Dorothy was alone with Storri her mother had been called temporarily
from the room At sight of Dorothys flowerlike hand in Storris hairy
paw Richards eyes turned jade
Mr Storms said Dorothy as Richard paused in the door permit me to
present Count Storri
Ah whispered Storri beneath his breath see now how my word comes
true
With that he put out his hand like a threat
Storris exultation fell frostnipped in greenest bud It was as though
some implacable destiny had seized his hand In vain did Storri put
forth his last resource of strengthhe who crushed horseshoes and
twisted pokers Like things of steel Richards fingers closed grimly and
invincibly upon those of Storri The Russian strove to recover his hand
against the awful force that held him his boasted strength was as the
strength of children
Storri looked into Richards eyes they were less ferocious but
infinitely more relentless than his own There was that too in the
others look which appalled the Tartar soul of Storrisomething in the
drawn brow the eye like agate the jaw as iron as the hand And ever
more and a little more that fearful grip came grinding The onyx eyes
glared in terror the tortured forehead white as paper became spangled
with drops of sweat
There arose a smothered feline screech as from a tiger whose back is
broken in a deadfall Richard gave his wrist the shadow of a twist and
Storri fell on one knee Then as though it were some foul thing
Richard tossed aside Storris hand from the nails of which blood came
oozing in black drops as large as grapes
What was it gasped Dorothy who had stood throughout the duel like
one planetstruck what was it you did
Storri on his knee asked Richard with a kind of vicious sweetness
There was something arctic something remorselessly glacial in the man
It caught and held Dorothy entrancing while it froze Storri on his
knee repeated Richard looking where his adversary was staining a
handkerchief with Tartar blood It was nothing It is a way in which
Russians honor methat is Russians whom I do not like
CHAPTER II
HOW A PRESIDENT IS BRED
Mr Patrick Henry Hanway a Senator of the United States had the
countenance of a prelate and the conscience of a buccaneer His
grandfatherit was at this old gentleman for lack of information he
was compelled to stop his ancestral countwas a farmer in his day
Also personally he had been the soul of ignorance and religion and of
a narrowness touching Scriptural things that oft got him into trouble
Grandfather Hanway read his Bible and believed it He held that the
earth was flat that it had four corners and that the sun went around
the earth He replied to a neighbor who assured him that the earth
revolved by placing a pan of water on his gatepost Not a drop was
spilled not a spoonful missing in the morning He showed this to the
astronomical neighbor as refutatory of that theory of revolution
For said Grandfather Hanway with a logical directness which among
the worlds greatest has more than once found parallel if the yearth
had turned over in the night like you allow that water would have done
run out
When the astronomical one undertook a counter argument Grandfather
Hanway fell upon him with the blind unreasoning fury of a holy war and
beat him beyond expression After that Grandfather Hanway was left
undisturbed in his beliefs and their demonstrations and tilled his sour
acres and begat a son
The son Hiram Hanway was sly and lazy and not wanting in a gift for
making money that was rather the fruit of avarice than any general
length and breadth and depth of native wit Having occasion to visit as
a young man the little humdrum capital of his State he stayed there
and engaged in the trade of lobbyist before the name was coined He
too married and had childrenPatrick Henry Hanway and Barbara Hanway
These his offspring were given a peculiar albeit not always a sumptuous
bringing up
When Patrick Henry Hanway was about the age of Oliver Twist at the time
Bill Sykes shoved him through the window Hiram Hanway caused him to be
appointed page in the State Senate There for eight years he lived in
the midst of all that treason and mendacity and cowardice and rapacity
and dishonor which as raw materials are ground together to produce laws
for a commonwealth He learned early that the ten commandments have no
bearing on politics and legislation and was taught that part of valor
which basing itself on greed and cunning and fear is called
discretion and consists in first running from an enemy and then hiding
from pursuit Altogether those eight years might have been less
pernicious in their influence had Patrick Henry Hanway passed them with
the chain gang and he emerged therefrom to cast his first vote
treacherous and plausible and boneless and falseas voracious as a pike
and as much without a principle
Patrick Henry Hanway did not follow in the precise footsteps of his
sire He resolved to make his money by pulling and hauling at
legislation but the methods should be changed He would improve upon
his father and instead of pulling and hauling from the lobby he would
pull and haul from within The returns were surer also it was easier to
knead and mold and bake ones loaf of legislation as a member with a
seat in Senate or Assembly than as some unassigned John Smith who
with a handful of bribes and a heart full of cheap intrigue must do his
work from the corridor A legislative seat was a twoedged sword to cut
both ways You could trade with it using it as a bribe bartering vote
for vote that was one edge Or you could threaten with it promising
nay for nay and thus compel some member to save your bill to save his
own that was the other edge A mere bribe from the lobby owned but the
one edge it was like a cavalry saber you might make the one slash at a
required vote with as many chances of missing as of cutting it down
Every argument therefore pointed to a seat whereat Patrick Henry
Hanway bent himself to its acquirement and at the age of twentysix he
was sworn to uphold the law and the Constitution and told to vote in the
Assembly In that body he flourished for ten years while his manhood
mildewed and his pockets filled
The native State of Patrick Henry Hanway was a mossgrown member of the
republic and had been one of the original thirteen It possessed with
other impedimenta a mossgrown aristocracy that borrowed money
devoured canvasbacks drank burgundy wore spotless tow in summer clung
to the duello and talked of days of greatness which had been before the
war It carried mossgrown laws upon its statute books which arranged
for the capture of witches the flogging of Quakers at a carts tail
the boring of Presbyterian tongues with redhot irons and the
punishment of masters who oppressed their hapless slaves with terrapin
oftener than three times a week However these measures excellent
doubtless in their hour together with the aristocracy referred to had
fallen to decay
The mossgrown aristocracy were aware in a lifeless lofty way of
Patrick Henry Hanway and tolerating while they despised him as one
without an origin permitted him his place in the legislature Somebody
must go and why not Patrick Henry Hanway They the aristocracy would
there command his services in what legislation touching game and
oysterbeds and the foreclosure of mortgages they required and that was
