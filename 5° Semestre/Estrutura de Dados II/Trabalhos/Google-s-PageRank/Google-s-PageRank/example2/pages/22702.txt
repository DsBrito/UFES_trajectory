on the drillground in the school of the company and the battalion He
wore the shoulderstraps of a second lieutenant
On one side of the soldier sat the Rev Mr Morton his cousin and on
the other Miss Bertha Morton a kindly faced middleaged lady who was
her brothers housekeeper and the hostess of this occasion
The fourth member of the party was a girl of nineteen or twenty She was
a very pretty girl and although today her pallid cheeks and red and
swollen eyelids would to other eyes have detracted somewhat from her
charms it was certain that they did not make her seem less adorable
to the young officer for he was her lover and was to march with the
regiment in the morning
Lieutenant Philip King was a lawyer and by perseverance and native
ability had worked up a fair practice for so young a man in and around
Upton When he volunteered he had to make up his mind to leave this
carefully gathered clientage to scatter or to be filched from him by
less patriotic rivals but it may be well believed that this seemed to
him a little thing compared with leaving Grace Roberts with the chance
of never returning to make her his wife If indeed it had been for him
to say he would have placed his happiness beyond hazard by marrying
her before the regiment marched nor would she have been averse but her
mother an invalid widow took a sensible rather than a sentimental view
of the case If he were killed she said a wife would do him no good
and if he came home again Grace would be waiting for him and that
ought to satisfy a reasonable man It had to satisfy an unreasonable
one The Robertses had always lived just beyond the garden from the
parsonage and Grace who from a little girl had been a great pet of the
childless minister and his sister was almost as much at home there as
in her mothers house When Philip fell in love with her the Mortons
were delighted They could have wished nothing better for either From
the first Miss Morton had done all she could to make matters smooth for
the lovers and the present little farewell banquet was but the last of
many meetings she had prepared for them at the parsonage
Philip had come out from camp on a threehours leave that afternoon
and would have to report again at halfpast seven It was nearly that
hour now though still light the season being midsummer There had been
an effort on the part of all to keep up a cheerful tone but as the time
of the inevitable separation drew near the conversation had been more
and more left to the minister and his sister who with observations
sometimes a little forced continued to fend off silence and the
demoralization it would be likely to bring to their young friends Grace
had been the first to drop out of the talking and Philips answers
when he was addressed grew more and more at random as the meetings of
his eyes with his sweethearts became more frequent and lasted longer
He will be the handsomest officer in the regiment thats one comfort
Wont he Grace said Miss Morton cheerily
The girl nodded and smiled faintly Her eyes were brimming and the
twitching of her lips from time to time betrayed how great was the
effort with which she kept her selfcommand
Yes said Mr Morton but though he looks very well now it is
nothing to the imposing appearance he will present when he comes back
with a colonels shoulderstraps You should be thinking of that
Grace
I expect we shall hear from him every day said Miss Morton He will
have no excuse for not writing with all those envelopes stamped and
addressed with blank paper in them which Grace has given him You
should always have three or four in your coat pocket Phil
The young man nodded
I suppose for the most part we shall learn of you through Grace but
you mustnt forget us entirely my boy said Mr Morton We shall want
to hear from you directly now and then
Yes I ll be sure to write Philip replied
I suppose it will be time enough to see the regiment pass if we are in
our places by nine oclock suggested Miss Morton after a silence
I think so said her brother It is a great affair to break camp and
I dont believe the march will begin till after that time
James has got us one of the windows of Ray  Seymours offices you
know Philip resumed Miss Morton which one did you say James
The north one
Yes the north one she resumed They say every window on Main Street
along the route of the regiment is rented Grace will be with us you
know You must nt forget to look up at us as you go byas if the
young man were likely to
He was evidently not now listening to her at all His eyes were fastened
upon the girls opposite him and they seemed to have quite forgotten
the others Miss Morton and her brother exchanged compassionate glances
Tears were in the ladys eyes A clock in the sittingroom began to
strike
One two three four five six seven
Philip started
What time is that he asked a little huskily No one replied at once
Then Mr Morton said
I am afraid it struck seven my boy
I must leave in ten minutes then said the young man rising from the
table The rest followed his example
I wonder if the buggy will be in time said he
It is at the gate replied Miss Morton I heard it drive up some time
ago
Unmindful of the others now Philip put his arm about Graces waist and
drew her away to the end of the piazza and thence out into the garden
Poor young things murmured Miss Morton the tears running down her
cheeks as she looked after them It is pitiful James to see how they
suffer
Yes said the minister and there are a great many just such scenes
today Ah well as St Paul says we see as yet but in part
Passing in and out among the shrubbery and presently disappearing
from the sympathetic eyes upon the piazza the lovers came to a little
summerhouse and there they entered Taking her wrists in his hands he
held her away from him and his eyes went slowly over her from head to
foot as if he would impress upon his mind an image that absence should
not have power to dim
You are so beautiful he said that in this moment when I ought to
have all my courage you make me feel that I am a madman to leave you
for the sake of any cause on earth The future to most men is but a
chance of happiness and when they risk it they only risk a chance
In staking their lives they only stake a lottery ticket which would
probably draw a blank But my ticket has drawn a capital prize I risk
not the chance but the certainty of happiness I believe I am a fool
and if I am killed that will be the first thing they will say to me on
the other side
Dont talk of that Phil Oh dont talk of being killed
No no of course not he exclaimed Dont fret about that I shall
not be killed Ive no notion of being killed But what a fool I am to
waste these last moments staring at you when I might be kissing you my
love my love And clasping her in his arms he covered her face with
kisses
She began to sob convulsively
Dont darling dont Dont make it so hard for me he whispered
hoarsely
Oh do let me cry she wailed It was so hard for me to hold back all
the time we were at table I must cry or my heart will break Oh my
own dear Phil what if I should never see you again Oh Oh
Nonsense darling he said crowding down the lump that seemed like
iron in his throat and making a desperate effort to keep his voice
steady You will see me again never doubt it Dont I tell you I am
coming back The South cannot hold out much longer Everybody says so I
shall be home in a year and then you will be my wife to be Gods Grace
to me all the rest of my life Our happiness will be on interest till
then ten per cent a month at least compound interest piling up every
day Just think of that dear dont let yourself think of anything
else
Oh Phil how I love you she cried throwing her arms around his neck
in a passion of tenderness Nobody is like you Nobody ever was Surely
God will not part us Surely He will not He is too good
No dear He will not Some day I shall come back It will not be
long Perhaps I shall find you waiting for me in this same little
summerhouse Let us think of that It was here you know we found out
each others secret that day
I had found out yours long before she said faintly smiling
Time s up Phil It was Mr Mortons voice calling to them from the
piazza
I must go darling Goodby
Oh no not yet not quite yet she wailed clinging to him Why we
have been here but a few moments It cant be ten minutes yet
Under the influence of that close passionate embrace those clinging
kisses and mingling tears there began to come over Philip a feeling of
weakness of fainting courage a disposition to cry out Nothing can be
so terrible as this I will not bear it I will not go By a tyrannical
effort of will against which his whole nature cried out he unwound her
arms from his neck and said in a choked voice
Darling this is harder than any battle I shall have to fight but this
is what I enlisted for I must go
He had reached the door of the summerhouse not daring for honors sake
to look back when a heartbroken cry smote his ear
You have nt kissed me goodby
He had kissed her a hundred times but these kisses she apparently
distinguished from the goodby kiss He came back and taking her again
in his embrace kissed her lips her throat her bosom and then once
more their lips met and in that kiss of parting which plucks the heart
up by the roots
How strong must be the barrier between one soul and another that they do
not utterly merge in moments like that turning the agony of parting to
the bliss of blended being
Pursued by the sound of her desolate sobbing he fled away
The stableboy held the dancing horse at the gate and Mr Morton and
his sister stood waiting there
Goodby Phil till we see you again said Miss Morton kissing him
tenderly We ll take good care of her for you
Will you please go to her now he said huskily She is in the
summerhouse For Gods sake try to comfort her
Yes poor boy I will she answered He shook hands with Mr Morton
and jumped into the buggy
I ll get a furlough and be back in a few months maybe Be sure to
tell her that he said
The stableboy stood aside the mettlesome horse gave a plunge and
started off at a threeminute gait The boy drew out his watch and
observed He haint got but fifteen minutes to git to camp in but he
ll do it The mare s a stepper and Phil King knows how to handle the
ribbons
The buggy vanished in a cloud of dust around the next turn in the road
The stableboy strode whistling down the street the minister went to
his study and Miss Morton disappeared in the shrubbery in the direction
of the summerhouse
II
Early next morning the country roads leading into Waterville were
covered with carts and wagons and carriages loaded with people coming
into town to see the regiment off The streets were hung with flags
and spanned with decorated arches bearing patriotic inscriptions Bed
white and blue streamers hung in festoons from building to building
and floated from cornices The stores and places of business were all
closed the sidewalks were packed with people in their Sunday clothes
and the windows and balconies were lined with gazers long before it was
time for the regiment to appear Everybodymen women and children
wore the national colors in cockades or rosettes while many young
girls were dressed throughout in red white and blue The city seemed
tricked out for some rare galaday but the grave faces of the expectant
throng and the subdued and earnest manner which extended even to the
older children stamped this as no ordinary holiday
After hours of patient waiting at last the word passes from mouth to
mouth They are coming Vehicles are quickly driven out of the way
and in a general hush all eyes are turned towards the head of the
street Presently there is a burst of martial music and the regiment
comes wheeling round the corner into view and fills the wide street from
curb to curb with its broad front As the blue river sweeps along the
rows of polished bayonets rising and falling with the swinging tread
of the men are like interminable ranks of foamcrested waves rolling in
upon the shore The imposing mass with its rhythmic movement gives the
impression of a single organism One forgets to look for the individuals
in it forgets that there are individuals Even those who have brothers
sons lovers there for a moment almost forget them in the impression of
a mighty whole The mind is slow to realize that this great dragon
so terrible in its beauty emitting light as it moves from a thousand
burnished scales with flaming crest proudly waving in the van is but
an aggregation of men singly so feeble
The hearts of the lookerson as they gaze are swelling fast An afflatus
of heroism given forth by this host of selfdevoted men communicates
itself to the most stolid spectators The booming of the drum fills the
brain and the blood in the veins leaps to its rhythm The unearthly
gayety of the fife like the sweet shrill song of a bird soaring above
the battle infects the nerves till the idea of death brings a scornful
smile to the lips Eyes glaze with rapturous tears as they rest upon the
flag There is a thrill of voluptuous sweetness in the thought of dying
for it Life seems of value only as it gives the poorest something to
sacrifice It is dying that makes the glory of the world and all other
employments seem but idle while the regiment passes
The time for farewells is gone by The lucky men at the ends of the
ranks have indeed an opportunity without breaking step to exchange an
occasional handshake with a friend on the sidewalk or to snatch a kiss
from wife or sweetheart but those in the middle of the line can only
look their farewells Now and then a mother intrusts her baby to a
fileleader to be passed along from hand to hand till it reaches the
father to be sent back with a kiss or maybe perched aloft on his
shoulder to ride to the depot crowing at the music and clutching at
the gleaming bayonets At every such touch of nature the people cheer
wildly From every window and balcony the ladies shower garlands upon
the troops
Where is Grace for this is the Upton company which is passing now
Yonder she stands on a balcony between Mr Morton and his sister She
is very pale and the tears are streaming down her cheeks but her face
is radiant She is smiling through her tears as if there was no such
thing on earth as fear or sorrow She has looked forward to this ordeal
with harrowing expectations only to find herself at the trying moment
seized upon and lifted above all sense of personal affliction by the
passion of selfdevotion with which the air is electric Her face as
she looks down upon her lover is that of a priestess in the ecstasy
of sacrifice He is saluting with his sword Now he has passed With a
great sob she turns away She does not care for the rest of the pageant
Her patriotism has suddenly gone The ecstasy of sacrifice is over She
is no longer a priestess but a brokenhearted girl who only asks to be
led away to some place where she can weep till her lover returns
III
There was to be a great battle the next day The two armies had been
long manoeuvring for position and now they stood like wrestlers who
have selected their holds and with body braced against body knee
against knee wait for the signal to begin the struggle There had
been during the afternoon some brisk fighting but a common desire to
postpone the decisive contest till the morrow had prevented the main
forces from becoming involved Philips regiment had thus far only been
engaged in a few trifling skirmishes barely enough to stir the blood
This was to be its first battle and the position to which it had been
allotted promised a bloody baptism in the morning The men were in
excellent heart but as night settled down there was little or no
merriment to be heard about the campfires Most were gathered in
groups discussing in low tones the chances of the morrow Some knowing
that every fibre of muscle would be needed for the work before them had
wisely gone to sleep while here and there a man heedless of the talk
going on about him was lying on his back staring up at the darkening
sky thinking
As the twilight deepened Philip strolled to the top of a little knoll
just out of the camp and sat down with a vague notion of casting up
accounts a little in view of the final settlement which very possibly
might come for him next day But the inspiration of the scene around him
soon diverted his mind from personal engrossments Some distance down
the lines he could see the occasional flash of a gun where a battery
was lazily shelling a piece of woods which it was desirable to keep the
enemy from occupying during the night A burning barn in that direction
made a flare on the sky Over behind the wooded hills where the
Confederates lay rockets were going up indicating the exchange of
signals and the perfecting of plans which might mean defeat and ruin to
him and his the next day Behind him within the Federal lines clouds
of dust dimly outlined against the glimmering landscape betrayed the
location of the roads along which artillery cavalry infantry were
hurrying eagerly forward to take their assigned places for the morrows
work
Who said that men fear death Who concocted that fable for old wives He
should have stood that night with Philip in the midst of a host of one
hundred and twentyfive thousand men in the full flush and vigor of
life calmly and deliberately making ready at dawn to receive death
in its most horrid forms at one anothers hands It is in vain that
Religion invests the tomb with terror and Philosophy shuddering
averts her face the nations turn from these gloomy teachers to storm
its portals in exultant hosts battering them wide enough for thousands
to charge through abreast The heroic instinct of humanity with its
high contempt of death is wiser and truer never let us doubt
than superstitious terrors or philosophic doubts It testifies to a
conviction deeper than reason that man is greater than his seeming
self to an underlying consciousness that his mortal life is but an
accident of his real existence the fashion of a day to be lightly worn
and gayly doffed at dutys call
What a pity it truly is that the tonic air of battlefieldsthe air
that Philip breathed that night before Antietamcannot be gathered
up and preserved as a precious elixir to reinvigorate the atmosphere in
times of peace when men grow faint of heart and cowardly and quake at
thought of death
The soldiers huddled in their blankets on the ground slept far more
soundly that night before the battle than their menfolk and womenfolk
in their warm beds at home For them it was a night of watching a vigil
of prayers and tears The telegraph in those days made of the nation an
intensely sensitive organism with nerves a thousand miles long Ere its
echoes had died away every shot fired at the front had sent a tremor
to the anxious hearts at home The newspapers and bulletin boards in
all the towns and cities of the North had announced that a great battle
would surely take place the next day and as the night closed in a
mighty cloud of prayer rose from innumerable firesides the selfsame
prayer from each that he who had gone from that home might survive the
battle whoever else must fall
The wife lest her own appeal might fail taught her cooing baby to lisp
the fathers name thinking that surely the Great Fathers heart would
not be able to resist a babys prayer The widowed mother prayed that if
it were consistent with Gods will he would spare her son She laid her
heart pierced through with many sorrows before Him She had borne so
much life had been so hard her boy was all she had to show for so much
enduredmight not this cup pass Pale impassioned maids kneeling
by their virgin beds wore out the night with an importunity that would
not be put off Sure in their great love and their little knowledge that
no case could be like theirs they beseeched God with bitter weeping
for their lovers lives because forsooth they could not bear it if
hurt came to them The answers to many thousands of these agonizing
appeals of maid and wife and mother were already in the enemys
cartridgeboxes
IV
The day came The dispatches in the morning papers stated that the
armies would probably be engaged from an early hour
Who that does not remember those battlesummers can realize from
any telling how the fathers and mothers the wives and sisters and
sweethearts at home lived through the days when it was known that a
great battle was going on at the front in which their loved ones were
engaged It was very quiet in the house on those days of battle All
spoke in hushed voices and stepped lightly The children too small to
understand the meaning of the shadow on the home felt it and took their
noisy sports elsewhere There was little conversation except as to when
definite news might be expected The household work dragged sadly for
though the women sought refuge from thought in occupation they were
constantly dropping whatever they had in hand to rush away to their
chambers to face the presentiment perhaps suddenly borne in upon them
with the force of a conviction that they might be called on to bear
the worst The table was set for the regular meals but there was little
pretense of eating The eyes of all had a faroff expression and they
seemed barely to see one another There was an intent listening look
upon their faces as if they were hearkening to the roar of the battle a
thousand miles away
Many pictures of battles have been painted but no true one yet for
the pictures contain only men The women are unaccountably left out
We ought to see not alone the opposing lines of battle writhing and
twisting in a death embrace the batteries smoking and flaming the
hurricanes of cavalry but innumerable women also spectral forms of
mothers wives sweethearts clinging about the necks of the advancing
soldiers vainly trying to shield them with their bosoms extending
supplicating hands to the foe raising eyes of anguish to Heaven The
soldiers grimfaced with battlelighted eyes do not see the ghostly
forms that throng them but shoot and cut and stab across and through
them as if they were not thereyes through them for few are the
balls and bayonets that reach their marks without traversing some of
these devoted breasts Spectral alas is their guardianship but real
are their wounds and deadly as any the combatants receive
Soon after breakfast on the day of the battle Grace came across to
the parsonage her swollen eyes and pallid face telling of a sleepless
night She could not bear her mothers company that day for she knew
that she had never greatly liked Philip Miss Morton was very tender and
sympathetic Grace was a little comforted by Mr Mortons saying that
commonly great battles did not open much before noon It was a respite
to be able to think that probably up to that moment at least no harm
had come to Philip In the early afternoon the minister drove into
Waterville to get the earliest bulletins at the Banner office leaving
the two women alone
The latter part of the afternoon a neighbor who had been in Waterville
drove by the house and Miss Morton called to him to know if there were
any news yet He drew a piece of paper from his pocket on which he had
scribbled the latest bulletin before the Banner office and read as
follows The battle opened with a vigorous attack by our right The
enemy was forced back stubbornly contesting every inch of ground
General s division is now bearing the brunt of the fight and is
suffering heavily The result is yet uncertain
The division mentioned was the one in which Philips regiment was
included Is suffering heavilythose were the words There was
something fearful in the way the present tense brought home to Grace a
sense of the battle as then actually in progress It meant that while
she sat there on the shady piazza with the drowsy hum of the bees in her
ears looking out on the quiet lawn where the house cat stretched
on the grass kept a sleepy eye on the birds as they flitted in the
branches of the appletrees Philip might be facing a storm of lead
and iron or maybe blent in some desperate handtohand struggle was
defending his lifeher lifeagainst murderous cut and thrust
To begin to pray for his safety was not to dare to cease for to cease
would be to withdraw a sort of protectionall alas I she could give
and abandon him to his enemies If she had been watching over him
from above the battle an actual witness of the carnage going on that
afternoon on the faroff field she could scarcely have endured a more
harrowing suspense from moment to moment Overcome with the agony she
threw herself on the sofa in the sittingroom and lay quivering
with her face buried in the pillow while Miss Morton sat beside her
stroking her hair and saying such feeble soothing words as she might
It is always hard and for ardent temperaments almost impossible to
hold the mind balanced in a state of suspense yielding overmuch neither
to hope nor to fear under circumstances like these As a relief to
the torture which such a state of tension ends in causing the mind
at length if it cannot abandon itself to hope embraces even despair
About five oclock Miss Morton was startled by an exceeding bitter cry
Grace was sitting upon the sofa Oh Miss Morton she cried bursting
into tears which before she had not been able to shed he is dead
Grace Grace what do you mean
He is dead I know he is dead wailed the girl and then she explained
that while from moment to moment she had sent up prayers for him every
breath a cry to God she suddenly had been unable to pray more and this
she felt was a sign that petition for his life was now vain Miss
Morton strove to convince her that this was but an effect of overwrought
nerves but with slight success
In the early evening Mr Morton returned with the latest news the
telegraph had brought The full scope of the result was not yet known
The advantage had probably remained with the National forces although
the struggle had been one of those close and stubborn ones with scanty
laurels for the victors to be expected when men of one race meet in
battle The losses on both sides had been enormous and the report was
confirmed that Philips division had been badly cut up
The parsonage was but one of thousands of homes in the land where no
lamps were lighted that evening the members of the household sitting
together in the darksilent or talking in low tones of the faraway
starlighted battlefield the anguish of the wounded the still heaps of
the dead
Nevertheless when at last Grace went home she was less entirely
despairing than in the afternoon Mr Morton in his calm convincing
way had shown her the groundlessness of her impression that Philip
was certainly dead and had enabled her again to entertain hope It
no longer rose indeed to the height of a belief that he had escaped
wholly scathless In face of the terrible tidings that would have been
too presumptuous But perhaps he had been only wounded Yesterday the
thought would have been insupportable but now she was eager to make
this compromise with Providence She was distinctly affected by the
curious superstition that if we voluntarily concede something to fate
while yet the facts are not known we gain a sort of equitable assurance
against a worse thing It was settled she told herself that she
was not to be overcome or even surprised to hear that Philip was
woundedslightly wounded She was no better than other women that he
should be wholly spared
The paper next morning gave many names of officers who had fallen
but Philips was not among them The list was confessedly incomplete
nevertheless the absence of his name was reassuring Grace went across
the garden after breakfast to talk with Miss Morton about the news and
the auspicious lack of news Her friends cheerful tone infused her with
fresh courage To one who has despaired a very little hope goes to
the head Eke wine to the brain of a faster and though still very
tremulous Grace could even smile a little now and was almost cheerful
Secretly already she was beginning to play false with fate and in flat
repudiation of her last nights compact to indulge the hope that her
soldier had not been even wounded But this was only at the bottom of
her heart She did not own to herself that she really did it She felt a
little safer not to break the bargain yet
About eleven oclock in the forenoon Mr Morton came in His start and
look of dismay on seeing Grace indicated that he had expected to find
his sister alone He hastily attempted to conceal an open telegram which
he held in his hand but it was too late Grace had already seen it and
whatever the tidings it might contain there was no longer any question
of holding them back or extenuating them Miss Morton after one look
at her brothers face silently came to the girls side and put her arms
around her waist Christ our Saviour she murmured for thy names
sake help her now Then the minister said
Try to be brave try to bear it worthily of him for my poor little
girl your sacrifice has been accepted He fell in a charge at the head
of his men
V
Philips body was brought home for burial and the funeral was a great
event in the village Business of all kinds was suspended and all the
people united in making of the day a solemn patriotic festival Mr
Morton preached the funeral sermon
Oh talk about the country sobbed Grace when he asked her if there
was anything in particular she would like him to speak of
For pitys sake dont let me feel sorry now that I gave him up for the
Union Dont leave me now to think it would have been better if I had
not let him go
So he preached of the country as ministers sometimes did preach in
those days making it very plain that in a righteous cause men did well
to die for their native land and their women did well to give them up
Expounding the lofty wisdom of selfsacrifice he showed how truly it
was said that whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever
will lose his life shall find it and how none make such rich profit
out of their lives as the heroes who seem to throw them away
They had come he told the assembled people to mourn no misadventure
no misfortune this dead soldier was not pitiable He was no victim of a
tearcompelling fate No broken shaft typified his career He was rather
one who had done well for himself a wise young merchant of his blood
who having seen a way to barter his life at incredible advantage at
no less a rate indeed than a mans for a nations had not let slip so
great an opportunity
So he went on still likening the life of a man to the wares of a
shopkeeper worth to him only what they can be sold for and a loss if
overkept till those who listened began to grow ill at ease in presence
of that flagdraped coffin and were vaguely troubled because they still
lived
Then he spoke of those who had been bereaved This soldier he said
like his comrades had staked for his country not only his own life but
the earthly happiness of others also having been fully empowered by
