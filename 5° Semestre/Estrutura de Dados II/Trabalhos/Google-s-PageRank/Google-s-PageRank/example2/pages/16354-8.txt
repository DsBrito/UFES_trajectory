launching torpedoes and three rapid firing Nordenfelt guns She lately
arrived in Santander Spain after the very rapid passage of forty
hours from England
THE NEW SPANISH ARMORED CRUISER REINA REGENTE
Illustration THE NEW SPANISH ARMORED CRUISER REINA REGENTE
The new armored cruiser Reina Regente which has been built and
engined by Messrs James  George Thomson of Clydebank for the
Spanish government has recently completed her official speed trials
on the Clyde the results attained being sufficient to justify the
statement made on her behalf that she is the fastest war cruiser in
the world She is a vessel of considerable size the following being
her measurements Length over all 330 ft and 307 ft between
perpendiculars breadth 5012 ft and her draught is 20 ft giving a
displacement of 5000 tons which will be increased to 5600 tons when
she is fully equipped
This vessel belongs to the internally protected type of war cruisers
a type of recent origin and of which she is the largest example yet
built The internal protection includes an armored deck which consists
of steel plates ranging from 318 in in thickness in the flat center
to 434 in at the sloping sides of the deck This protective deck
covers the vitals of the ship the machinery boilers etc Then
there is a very minute subdivision in the hull of the ship there
being in all 156 watertight compartments 83 of which are between
the armored deck and the one immediately above it or between wind and
water Most of these compartments are used as coal bunkers Of the
remainder of the watertight compartments 60 are beneath the armor
Throughout her whole length the Reina Regente has a double bottom
which also extends from side to side of the ship In order to keep the
vessel as free of water as possible there have been fitted on board
four 14 in centrifugal pumps all of which are connected to a main
pipe running right fore and aft in the ship and into which branches
are received from every compartment These pumps are of the Bon
Accord type and were supplied by Messrs Drysdale  Co Glasgow
Not being weighted by massive external armor the Reina Regente is
unusually light in proportion to her bulk and in consequence it has
been rendered possible to supply her with engines of extraordinary
power They are of the horizontal triple expansion type driving twin
screws and placed in separate watertight compartments The boilers
four in number are also in separate compartments Well above the
water line there are two auxiliary boilers which were supplied by
Messrs Merryweather London and are intended for raising steam
rapidly in cases of emergency These boilers are connected with all
the auxiliary engines of the ship numbering no fewer than
fortythree
The engines have been designed to indicate 12000 horse power and on
the trial when they were making 110 revolutions per minute they
indicated considerably upward of 11000 horse power the bearings all
the while keeping wonderfully cool and the temperature of the engine
and boiler rooms being never excessive The boilers are fitted with a
forced draught arrangement giving a pressure of 1 in of water In the
official run she attained a speed equal to 21 knots over 24 miles
per hour and over a period of four hours an average speed of 2072
knots per hour was developed without the full power of the engines
being attained The average steam pressure in the boilers was 140 lb
per square inch In the course of some private trials made by the
builders the consumption of coal was tested with the result that
while the vessel was going at a moderate speed the very low
consumption of 14 lb of coal per indicated horse power per hour was
reached The vessel is capable of steaming 6000 knots when there is a
normal supply of coal in her bunkers and when they are full there is
sufficient to enable her to steam 13000 knots
The Reina Regente will be manned by 50 officers and a crew of 350 men
all of whom will have their quarters on the main deck Among her
fittings and equipment there are three steam lifeboats and eight other
boats five of Sir William Thomsons patent compasses and a complete
electric light installation the latter including two powerful search
lights which are placed on the bridge All parts of the vessel are in
communication by means of speaking tubes In order to enable the
vessel to turn speedily she is fitted with the sternway rudder of
Messrs Thomson  Biles This contrivance is a combination of a
partially balanced rudder with a rudder formed as a continuation of
the after lines of a ship The partial balance tends to reduce the
strains on the steering gear and thereby enables the rudder area to
be increased without unduly straining the gear
When fitted out for actual service this novel war cruiser will have a
most formidable armament consisting of four 24 centimeter Hontorio
guns each of 21 tons six 12 centimeter guns also of the Hontorio
type six 6 pounder Nordenfelt guns fourteen small guns and five
torpedo tubesone at the stern two amidships and two at the bow of
the ship
It is worthy of note that this war cruiser was constructed in fifteen
months or three months under the stipulated contract time in fact
the official trial of the vessel took place exactly eighteen months
from the signing of the contract Not only is this the fastest war
cruiser afloat but her owners also possess in the El Destructor what
is probably the simplest torpedo catcher afloat a vessel which has
attained a speed of 2212 knots or over 26 miles per hour

OLIVER EVANS AND THE STEAM ENGINE
A correspondent of the New York Times deeming that far too much
credit has been given to foreigners for the practical development of
the steam engine contributes the following interesting resume
Of all the inventions of ancient or modern times none have more
importantly and beneficently influenced the affairs of mankind than
the double acting high pressure steam engine the locomotive the
steam railway system and the steamboat all of which inventions are
of American origin The first three are directly and the last
indirectly associated with a patent that was granted by the State of
Maryland in 1787 being the very year of the framing of the
Constitution of the United States In view of the momentous nature of
the services which these four inventions have rendered to the material
and national interests of the people of the United States it is to be
hoped that neither they nor their origin will be forgotten in the
coming celebration of the centennial of the framing of the
Constitution
The high pressure steam engine in its stationary form is almost
ubiquitous in America In all great iron and steel works in all
factories in all plants for lighting cities with electricity in
brief wherever in the United States great power in compact form is
wanted there will be found the high pressure steam engine furnishing
all the power that is required and more too if more is demanded
because it appears to be equal to every human requisition But go
beyond America Go to Great Britain and the American steam
enginealthough it is not termed American in Great Britainwill be
found fast superseding the English enginein other words James
Watts condensing engine It is the same the world over On all the
earth there is not a steam locomotive that could turn a wheel but for
the fact that in common with every locomotive from the earliest
introduction of that invention it is simply the American steam engine
put on wheels and it was first put on wheels by its American
inventor Oliver Evans being the same Oliver Evans to whom the State
of Maryland granted the before mentioned patent of 1787
He is the same Oliver Evans whom Elijah Galloway the British writer
on the steam engine compared with James Watt as to the authorship of
the locomotive or rather steam carriage as the locomotive was in
those days termed After showing the unfitness of Mr Watts low
pressure steam engine for locomotive purposes Mr Galloway more than
fifty years ago wrote We have made these remarks in this place in
order to set at rest the title of Mr Watt to the invention of steam
carriages And taking for our rule that the party who first attempted
them in practice by mechanical arrangements of his own is entitled to
the reputation of being their inventor Mr Oliver Evans of America
appears to us to be the person to whom that honor is due He is the
same Oliver Evans whom the Mechanics Magazine of London the
leading journal of its kind at that period had in mind when in its
number of September 1830 it published the official report of the
competitive trial between the steam carriages Rocket San Pariel
Novelty and others on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway
In that trial the companys engines developed about 15 miles in an
hour and spurts of still higher speed The Magazine points to the
results of the trial and then under the heading of The First
Projector of Steam Traveling it declares that all that had been
accomplished had been anticipated and its feasibility practically
exemplified over a quarter of a century before by Oliver Evans an
American citizen The Magazine showed that many years before the
trial Mr Evans had offered to furnish steam carriages that on level
railways should run at the rate of 300 miles in a day or he would
not ask pay therefor The writer will state that this offer by Mr
Evans was made in November 1812 at which date not a British steam
carriage had yet accomplished seven miles in an hour
In 1809 Mr Evans endeavored to establish a steam railway both for
freight and passenger traffic between New York and Philadelphia
offering to invest 500 per mile in the enterprise At the date of his
effort there was not a railway in the world over ten miles long nor
does there appear to have been another human being who up to that date
had entertained even the thought of a steam railway for passenger and
freight traffic In view of all this is it at all surprising that the
British Mechanics Magazine declared Oliver Evans an American to
be the first projector of steam railway traveling In 1804 Mr Evans
made a most noteworthy demonstration his object being to practically
exemplify that locomotion could be imparted by his high pressure steam
engine to both carriages and boats and the reader will see that the
date of the demonstration was three years before Fulton moved a boat
by means of Watts low pressure steam engine The machine used
involved the original double acting high pressure steam engine the
original steam locomotive and the original high pressure steamboat
The whole mass weighed over twenty tons
Notwithstanding there was no railway except a temporary one laid over
a slough in the path Mr Evans engine moved this great weight with
ease from the southeast corner of Ninth and Market streets in the
city of Philadelphia one and a half miles to the River Schuylkill
There the machine was launched into the river and the land wheels
being taken off and a paddle wheel attached to the stern and connected
with the engine the now steamboat sped away down the river until it
emptied into the Delaware whence it turned upward until it reached
Philadelphia Although this strange craft was square both at bow and
stern it nevertheless passed all the upbound ships and other sailing
vessels in the river the wind being to them ahead The writer repeats
that this thorough demonstration by Oliver Evans of the possibility of
navigation by steam was made three years before Fulton But for more
than a quarter of a century prior to this demonstration Mr Evans had
time and again asserted that vessels could be thus navigated He did
not contend with John Fitch but on the contrary tried to aid him and
advised him to use other means than oars to propel his boat But Fitch
was wedded to his own methods In 1805 Mr Evans published a book on
the steam engine mainly devoted to his form thereof In this book he
gives directions how to propel boats by means of his engine against
the current of the Mississippi Prior to this publication he
associated himself with some citizens of Kentuckyone of whom was the
grandfather of the present Gen Chauncey McKeever United States
Armythe purpose being to build a steamboat to run on the
Mississippi The boat was actually built in Kentucky and floated to
New Orleans The engine was actually built in Philadelphia by Mr
Evans and sent to New Orleans but before the engine arrived out the
boat was destroyed by fire or hurricane The engine was then put to
sawing timber and it operated so successfully that Mr Stackhouse
the engineer who went out with it reported on his return from the
South that for the 13 months prior to his leaving the engine had been
constantly at work not having lost a single day
The reader can thus see the high stage of efficiency which Oliver
Evans had imparted to his engine full 80 years ago On this point Dr
Ernst Alban the German writer on the steam engine when speaking of
the high pressure steam engine writes Indeed to such perfection
did he Evans bring it that Trevithick and Vivian who came after
him followed but clumsily in his wake and do not deserve the title
of either inventors or improvers of the high pressure engine which
the English are so anxious to award to them When it is considered
under what unfavorable circumstances Oliver Evans worked his merit
must be much enhanced and all attempts made to lessen his fame only
show that he is neither understood nor equaled by his detractors
The writer has already shown that there are bright exceptions to this
general charge brought by Dr Alban against British writers but the
overwhelming mass of them have acted more like envious children than
like men when speaking of the authorship of the double acting high
pressure steam engine the locomotive and the steam railway system
Speaking of this class of British writers Prof Renwick when
alluding to their treatment of Oliver Evans writes Conflicting
national pride comes in aid of individual jealousy and the writers of
one nation often claim for their own vain and inefficient projectors
the honors due to the successful enterprise of a foreigner Many of
these writers totally ignore the very existence of Oliver Evans and
all of them attribute to Trevithick and Vivian the authorship of the
high pressure steam engine and the locomotive Yet when doing so all
of them substantially acknowledge the American origin of both
inventions because it is morally certain that Trevithick and Vivian
got possession of the plans and specifications of his engine Oliver
Evans sent them to England in 17945 by Mr Joseph Stacy Sampson of
Boston with the hope that some British engineer would approve and
conjointly with him take out patents for the inventions Mr Sampson
died in England but not until after he had extensively exhibited Mr
Evans plans apparently however without success After Mr
Sampsons death Trevithick and Vivian took out a patent for a high
pressure steam engine This could happen and yet the invention be
original with them
But they introduced into Cornwall a form of boiler hitherto unknown in
Great Britain namely the cylindrical flue boiler which Oliver Evans
had invented and used in America years before the names of Trevithick
and Vivian were associated with the steam engine Hence they were
charged over fifty years ago with having stolen the invention of Mr
Evans and the charge has never been refuted Hence when British
writers ignore the just claims of Oliver Evans and assert for
Trevithick and Vivian the authorship of the high pressure steam engine
and the locomotive they thereby substantially acknowledge the
American origin of both inventions They are not only of American
origin but their author although born in 1755 was nevertheless an
American of the second generation seeing that he was descended from
the Rev Dr Evans Evans who in the earlier days of the colony of
Pennsylvania came out to take charge of the affairs of the Episcopal
Church in Pennsylvania
The writer has thus shown that with the patent granted by the State of
Maryland to Oliver Evans in 1787 were associatedfirst the double
acting high pressure steam engine which today is the standard steam
engine of the world second the locomotive that is in worldwide use
third the steam railway system which pervades the world fourth the
high pressure steamboat which term embraces all the great ocean
steamships that are actuated by the compound steam engine as well as
all the steamships on the Mississippi and its branches
The time and opportunity has now arrived to assert before all the
world the American origin of these universally beneficent inventions
Such a demonstration should be made if only for the instruction of
the rising generation Not a school book has fallen into the hands of
the writer that correctly sets forth the origin of the subject matter
of this paper He apprehends that it is the same with the books used
in colleges and universities for otherwise how could that parody on
the history of the locomotive called The Life of George Stephenson
Railway Engineer by Samuel Smiles have met such unbounded success
To the amazement of the writer a learned professor in one of the most
important institutions of learning in the country did in a lecture
quote Smiles as authority on a point bearing on the history of the
locomotive It is true that he made amends by adding when his lecture
was published a counter statement but that such a man should have
seriously cited such a work shows the widespread mischief done among
people not versed in engineering lore by the admirably written romance
of Smiles who as Edward C Knight in his Mechanical Dictionary
truly declares has pettifogged the whole case If as Prof Renwick
intimates conflicting national pride has led the major part of
British writers to suppress the truth as to the origin of the high
pressure steam engine the locomotive and the steam railway system
surely true national pride should induce the countrymen of Oliver
Evans to assert it In closing this paper the writer will say for the
information of the socalled practical men of the country or in
other words those men whose judgment of an invention is mainly guided
by its money value that Poors Manual of Railroads in the United
States for 1886 puts their capital stock and their debts at over
8162000000 The value of the steamships and steamboats actuated by
the high pressure steam engine the writer has no means of
ascertaining Neither can he appraise the factories and other plants
in the United Statesto say nothing of the rest of the worldin
which the high pressure steam engine forms the motive power
AUGUSTES ENDLESS STONE SAW
It does not seem as if the band or endless saw should render the same
services in sawing stone as in working wood and metals for the
reason that quite a great stress is necessary to cause the advance of
the stone which is in most cases very heavy against the blade Mr
A Auguste however has not stopped at such a consideration or
better he has got round the difficulty by holding the block
stationary and making the blade act horizontally Fig 1 gives a
general view of the apparatus Fig 2 gives a plan view Fig 3 is a
transverse section Fig 4 is an end view Figs 5 6 and 7 show
details of the water and sand distributer and Figs 8 9 and 10 show
the pulleys arranged for obtaining several slabs at once

Illustration FIGS 3 and 4 AUGUSTES STONE SAW
Illustration FIGS 5 through 10 AUGUSTES STONE SAW
The machine is wholly of cast iron The frame consists of four
columns A bolted to a rectangular bed plate A and connected above
by a frame B that forms a table for the support of the transmission
pieces as well as the iron ladders a and the platform b that
supports the water reservoirs C and sand receptacles C
Between the two columns at the ends of the machine there are two
crosspieces D and D so arranged that they can move vertically like
carriages These pieces carry the axles of the pulleys P and P
around which the band saw S passes In the center of the bed plate
A which is cast in two pieces connected by bolts there are ties to
which are screwed iron rails e which form a railway over which the
platform car E carrying the stone is made to advance beneath the
saw
The saw consists of an endless band of steel either smooth or
provided with teeth that are spaced according to the nature of the
material to be worked It passes around the pulleys P and P which
are each encircled by a wide and stout band of rubber to cause the
blade to adhere and which are likewise provided with two flanges Of
the latter the upper one is cast in a piece with the pulley and the
lower one is formed of sections of a circle connected by screws The
pulley P is fast and carries along the saw the other P is
loose and its hub is provided with a bronze socket Figs 1 and 4
It is through this second pulley that the blade is given the desired
tension and to this effect its axle is forged with a small disk
adjusted in a frame and traversed by a screw d which is
maneuvered through a hand wheel The extremities of the crosspieces D
and D are provided with brass sockets through which the pieces slide
up and down the columns with slight friction under the action of the
vertical screws g and g within the columns
A rotary motion is communicated to the four screws simultaneously by
the transmission arranged upon the frame To this effect the pulley
P which receives the motion and transmits it to the saw has its
axle f prolonged and grooved throughout its length in order that
it may always be carried along whatever be the place it occupies by
the hollow shaft F which is provided at the upper extremity with a
bevel wheel and two keys placed at the level of the bronze collars of
its support G The slider D is cast in a piece with the pillow
block that supports the shaft f and the bronze bushing of this
pillow block is arranged to receive a shoulder and an annular
projection both forged with the shaft and designed to carry it as
well as the pulley P keyed to its extremity Now the latter by its
weight exerts a pressure which determines a sensible friction upon
the bushing through this shoulder and projection and in order to
diminish the same the bushing is continuously moistened with a
solution of soap and water through the pipe g which runs from the
reservoir G
The saw is kept from deviating from its course by movable guides
placed on the sliders D and D These guides H and H each consist
of a cast iron box fixed by a nut to the extremity of the arms h
and h and coupled by crosspieces j and j which keep them
apart and give the guides the necessary rigidity
The shaft m mounted in pillow blocks fixed to the left extremity
of the frame receives motion from the motor through the pulley p
at the side of which is mounted the loose pulley p This motion is
transmitted by the drum M and the pulley L to the shaft l at
the other extremity This latter is provided with a pinion l
which through the wheel F gives motion to the saw The shaft m
likewise controls the upward or downward motion of the saw through the
small drums N and n and the two pairs of fast and loose pulleys
N and n This shaft too transmits motion a very slow one to
the four screws g and g in the interior of the columns and the
nuts of which are affixed to the sliders D and D To this effect
the shaft q is provided at its extremities with endless screws
that gear with two wheels q with helicoidal teeth fixed near the
middle of two parallel axes r running above the table B and
terminating in bevel wheels r that engage with similar wheels
fixed at the end of the screws g and g
The car that carries the block to the saw consists of a strong frame
E mounted upon four wheels This frame is provided with a pivot and a
circular track for the reception of the cast iron platform E which
rests thereon through the intermedium of rollers Between the
rails e and parallel with them are fixed two strong screws e
held by supports that raise them to the bottom of the car frame so
that they can be affixed thereto When once the car is fastened in
this way the screws are revolved by means of winches and the block
is thus made to advance or recede a sufficient distance to make the
lines marked on its surface come exactly opposite the saw blade
In sawing hard stones it is necessary as well known to keep up a
flow of water and fine sand upon the blade in order to increase its
friction Upon two platforms b at the extremities of the machine
are fixed the water reservoir C and the receptacles C containing
fine sand or dry pulverized grit stone As may be seen from Figs 5
and 6 the bottom of the sand box C is conical and terminates in a
hopper T beneath which is adjusted a slide valve t connected
with a screw that carries a pulley T By means of this valve the
bottom of the hopper may be opened or closed in such a way as to
regulate the flow of the sand at will by acting upon the pulley T
through a chain t passing over the guide pulley t2 A rubber
tube u which starts from the hopper runs into a metal pipe U
that descends to the guide H with which it is connected by a collar
Under the latter this pipe terminates in a sphere containing a small
aperture to allow the sand to escape upon an inclined board provided
with a flange At the same time through the rubber tube c coming
from the reservoir C a stream of water is directed upon the board in
order to wet the sand
As the apparatus with but a single endless saw makes but two kerfs at
once Mr Auguste has devised an arrangement by means of which several
blades may be used and the work thus be expedited
Without changing the general arrangements he replaces the pulleys P
and P by two half drums V and V Figs 8 9 and 10 which are
each cast in a piece with the crosspieces D2 and D3 designed to
replace D and D and like them sliding up and down the columns A
of the frame Motion is transmitted to all the saw blades by a cog
wheel X keyed to the vertical shaft f and gearing with small
pinions x which are equally distant all around and which
themselves gear with similar pinions forming the radii of a succession
of circles concentric with the first All these pinions are mounted
upon axles traversing bronze bearings within the drum which to this
effect is provided with slots The axles of the pinions are prolonged
in order to receive rollers x surrounded with rubber so as to
facilitate through friction the motion of all the blades running
between them
The other drum V is arranged in the same way except that it is not
cast in a piece with the carriage D3 but is so adjusted to it that
a tension may be exerted upon the blades by means of the screw d
and its hand wheel
Through this combination all the blades are carried along at once in
opposite directions and at the same speedPublication

ROBURITE THE NEW EXPLOSIVE
A series of experiments of great interest and vital importance to
colliery owners and all those engaged in mining coal has been carried
out during the last ten days in the South Yorkshire coal field The
new mines regulation act provides that any explosible used in coal
mines shall either be fired in a water cartridge or be of such a
nature that it cannot inflame firedamp This indeed is the problem
which has puzzled many able chemists during the last few years and
which Dr Roth of Berlin claims to have solved with his explosive
roburite We recently gave a detailed account of trials carried out
at the School of Military Engineering Chatham to test the safety and
strength of roburite as compared with gun cotton dynamite and
blasting gelatine The results were conclusive of the great power of
the new explosive and so far fully confirmed the reports of the able
mining engineer and the chemical experts who had been sent to Germany
to make full inquiries These gentlemen had ample opportunity of
seeing roburite used in the coal mines of Westphalia and it was
mainly upon their testimony that the patents for the British empire
were acquired by the Roburite Explosive Company
It has however been deemed advisable to give practical proof to
those who would have to use it that roburite possesses all the high
qualities claimed for it and hence separate and independent trials
have been arranged in such representative collieries as the
Wharncliffe Silkstone near Sheffield Monk Bretton near Barnsley
and further north in the Durham coal field at Lord Londonderrys
Seaham and Silksworth collieries Mr GB Walker resident manager of
the Wharncliffe Colliery Company had gone to Germany as an
independent observerprovided with a letter of introduction from the
