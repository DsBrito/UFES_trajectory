a nigger up to Sixfingered Jack the Portugee If it want forow
Josephus Henryfor this rheumatiz Id be aboard the Benn this

But you aint fit for the sea no longer mumbled Onearm Jerry
through one corner of the mouth that paralysis had drawn awry
Thats what I told the owners of the Benn when I fit em offm

Better leave it where it is counselled Jerry his cautious thrift
dominating even in that hour of death Landsharks is allus lookin
out sharp for sailormen that git on shore
Its why I dont dast to go into businessme thats follered the
sea so long returned the skipper nursing his aching leg
Then do as I tell ye to do said the old man on the bed It may
be a comedown for a man thats had men under him all his life but
it amounts to moren five hundred a year sure and stiddy Its
something to do and you couldnt stand it to loafyou thats always
been so active It aint reskin anything and with all the passin
and the meetin folks and the gossipin and the chattin and all
that all your time is took up Its honerble its stiddy Leave
your money where it is take my place and keep this job in the
family
The two men were talking in a little cottage at the end of a long
covered bridge A painted board above the door heralded the fact that
the cottage was the tollhouse and gave the rates of toll
Its Providence that has sent you here jest as I was bein took out
of the world went on Uncle Jerry Youre my only reltive Im
leavin you the three thousand Ive accumulated I want to leave you
the job too I
A hoarse hail outside interrupted The Capn scowling shuffled out
and came in jingling some pennies in his brown hand
I feel like a handorgan monkey every time I go out there he
muttered
I tell ye protested the old man as earnestly as his feebleness
would permit theres lots of big business in this world that dont
need so long a head as this one doesbein as how youre goin to
run it shipshape You need brains that you do nephy Itll keep
you studyin all the time When you git interested in it you aint
never goin to have time to be lonesome Theres the plain hello folks
to be treated one way the goodday folks the passthetimeoday
folks the folks that need the tip o the hatjest for politeness
and not because youre beneath em he hastened to add noting the
skippers scowl the folks that swing up to the platform the folks
that youve got to chase a little even if it is muddy the folks
that pay in advance and want you to remember it and save em trouble
the folks that pay when they come back and the folks that never pay
at alland I tell ye nephy theres where your work is cut out for
ye Ive only had one arm but theres mighty few that have ever done
me out of toll and Im goin to give ye a tip on the old bellwether
of em all Im goin to advise ye to stand to one side and let him
pass Hes
And me a man thats licked every
Hold on Hes diffrunt from all youve ever tackled
In his excitement the old tollgatherer attempted to struggle upon
his elbow He choked The nurse came and laid him back with gentle
remonstrance Before he had regained his voice to talk more the
minister came obeying a summons of grave import Then came One who
sealed Onearm Jerrys lips and quieted the fingers that had been
picking at the faded coverlet as though they were gathering pennies
And a day later half sullenly the Capn accepted the proposition
of the directors of the bridge company who had said some very
flattering things to him about the reliability of the Sproul family
He reflected that he was far enough from tidewater to avoid the
mariners who had known him in his former state Ill dock and repair
riggin he pondered Its a comedown but Ill clear and cruise
again when the notion strikes me
His possessions came promptly by expresshis seachest two parrots
and a most amazing collection of curios that fairly transformed the
little cottage where the skipper with seamans facility in
housekeeping set up bachelors hall
He grudgingly allowed to himself that he was going to like it The
sun beamed blandly warm on the little bench before the tollhouse
His rheumatism felt better People commented admiringly on such of
the curios as were displayed in the windows of the cottage And when
the parrotsPort and Starboardripped out such remarks as
Ahoy Heave to Down hellum and larded the conversation with
horrible oaths the wayfarers professed to see great humor in the
performance
In a little while the parrots would squall as soon as a traveller
appeared at the brow of the river hill or poked out from the dim depths
of the covered bridge Even when the Capn was busy in his little
kitchen he never failed to receive due notice of the approach of
persons either in wagons or on foot
It will be a good man who runs toll on this bridge he mused one
day as he poked dainties between the bars of the parrots cages
The old un was a good man in his day like all the Sprouls He didnt
have but one arm but there want many that ever come it over him
Ive been thinkin about one that did and that he was scart of If
there was ever a man that scart him and kept him scart till the day
he died then Id like to see that same It will be for me to show
him that the nephy has some accounts of the poor old uncle to square
Up the slope where the road to Smyrna Bridge wound behind the willows
there was the growing rattle of wheels The Capn cocked his head
His seamans instinct detected something stormy in that impetuous
approach He fixed his gaze on the bend of the road
Into sight came tearing a tall gaunt horse dragging a wagon equally
tall and gaunt The horse was galloping and a tall man in the wagon
stood up and began to crack a great whip with reports like a pistol
fusillade
Capn Sproul took three defiant steps into the middle of the road
and then took one big step backa stride that made his rheumatiz
speak up but a stride that carried him safely to his platform The
team roared past The big whip swished over his head and the snapper
barked in his ear He got one fleeting glimpse at the man who was
drivinga man with a face as hard as a pine knot His lips were rolled
away from his yellow teeth in a grimace that was partly a grin partly
a sneer A queer tall pointed cap with a knob on its top was perched
on his head like a candlesnuffer on a taper With a shrill yell and
more crackings of his whip he disappeared into the gloomy mouth of
the covered bridge and the roaring echoes followed him
The skipper stood looking first at the mouth of the bridge and then
at the sign above it that warned
THREE DOLLARS FINE
FOR DRIVING FASTER THAN A WALK
As I was jest sayin he muttered as the noise of the wheels died
away I should like to see that manand I reckon as how I have
He sat down under the woodbine that wreathed the little porch and
slowly filled his pipe his gaze still on the bridge opening As he
crooked his leg and dragged the match across the faded blue of his
trousers he growled
I dunno who he is nor where hes come from nor where hes goin
to nor when he expects to get back but as near as I can figger
it he owes me ten cents toll and three dollars finemoney makin
a total of three ten to be charged and collected as I understand
it
When he had got his pipe to going after some little gruntings he
pulled out a notebook and a stubby pencil and marked down the figures
At the head of the page he scrawled
Old Hurrycain Dr
That name ll have to do till I git a better one he mused and
then stood up to receive toll from a farmer who drove slowly out from
the bridge his elbows on his knees his horse walking slouchily
If it aint no great output to you mister to tell do you happen
to know who was the nub of that streak of wind and cusswords that
jest went past here
The farmer bored him strangely a moment with his little gimlet eyes
snorted out a laugh clapped his reins and started on
I heard ye was a joker he shouted back his beard trailing over
his shoulder as he turned his head
There aint no joke to this roared the skipper But the man kept
on
Another patron emerged from the bridge digging from his trousers
pocket
You spoke it didnt ye demanded the skipper Chain lightnin
on wheels Who is he
The man grinned amiably and appreciatively
Quite a hand to hector aint ye tollkeeper He was goin so fast
I didnt know him neither He drove on though the Capn hobbled
after him shouting strong language in which the parrots joined
You neednt try to make me think that there aint nobody who dont
know the Kunl was the retort the man flung over his shoulder
Nice and accommodatin class of paternage thats passin growled
the Capn kicking an inoffensive chair as he came back to his
platform They talk about him as though he was Lord Gull and ruler
of the stars Jest as though a man that had sailed deep water all
his days knowed all the old landpiruts round here
It was a pedestrianOld Man Jordan bound to the village with a few
pats of butter in a bucketthat the skipper finally held up
Oh sho said Old Man Jordan Course ye know him Every one does
I tell you I dont bawled the skipper
Why yas you do
Say look ahere Whatsyourname Im goin to give ye ten seconds
to tell me the name of that critter
He made a clutch to one side and then remembered with a flush that
he was no longer in reach of a spikerack
Why that was Kunl Gideon Ward faltered Uncle Jordan impressed
at last by the Capns fury I thought ye knew
Thought Thought Why ye never thought in your life You only
thought you thought I dunno no more who you mean by Kunl Gideon
Ward than as though you said General Bill Beelzebub
Why yas you do
There you go again Do you mean to stand here and tell me Im a liar
The glare in the seamans eyes was too fierce to be fronted
Kunl Gideon Ward isiswall hes Kunl Gideon Ward
Jordan backed away suddenly at the oath the Capn ripped out
He owns more timber land than any other man in the county He hires
more men than any one else He aint never been downed in a trade
or a fight yet Hes got double teeth upper and lower all the way
round drinks kairosene in the winter cause its more warmin than
rum andand
Well whats that got to do with his runnin toll on this bridge
demanded the Capn
Bridge piers hold up his logs he says and he aint never goin
to pay toll till the bridgemen pay him for loss of time on logs Its
been what you might call a standoff for a good many years Best thing
is to let him run toll Thats what your uncle thought I reckoned
you knew all about Kunl Gid Ward Why everybody knows
Say you let up on that string right now and here snorted the
Capn
Old Man Jordan trotted away
While the skipper was still pondering on the matter of Colonel
Wardthe meditation had lasted over into the next daythere was
a roar on the bridge and the subject of his reflections passed in
a swirl of dust on his return trip He was standing up in his wagon
as before and he saluted the indignant tollman with a flick of his
whip that started the dust from the latters peajacket
Hes been over to the home place to see his sister Jane volunteered
Uncle Jordan again on his way to the village with eggs She aint
never got married and he aint never got married Old Squire Ward
left his whole property to the two of em and the Kunl aint ever
let it be divided He runs the whole estate and domineers over her
and she dont dast to say her souls her own If I was Jane Id have
my half out and git married to some nice man and git a little comfort
outn life He dont give her nonedont let her have the handlin
of a cent of money Shes a turrible nice sort of woman Theres
risin a hundred thousand dollars in her share if the truth was known
and theres been some pretty good men shine up around her a little
but the Kunl has run em away with a picked stick
Has hey
There aint no Jack the GiantKillers in these parts sighed Old
Man Jordan hooking his bucket upon his arm and shambling away
For several days Capn Sproul was busy about the gable end of the
bridge during his spare moments and hours climbing up and down the
ladder and handling a rope and certain pulleys with sailor dexterity
All the time his grim jawmuscles ridged his cheeks When he had
finished he had a rope running through pulleys from the big gate up
over the gable of the bridge and to the porch of the tollhouse
There he muttered with great satisfaction thats the first
beartrap I ever set and it aint no extra sort of job but I reckon
when old grizzly goes aginst it hell callate that this ere is
a tollbridge
Then came days of anxious waiting Sometimes a teamsters shouts to
his horses up around the willows sent the Capn hobbling to the end
of the rope An unusual rattling in the bridge put him at his post
with his teeth set and his eyes gleaming
II
One day a mild and placid little woman in dovegray came walking from
the bridge and handed over her penny She eyed the skipper with
interest and cocked her head with the pert demureness of a sparrow
while she studied the parrots who were waddling about their cages
I never heard a parrot talk sir she said I hear that yours talk
I should dearly love to hear them
Their language is mostly deepwater flavor said the Capn curtly
and taint flavored edsackly like vanilla icecream Theres more
of the peppersass tang to it than ladies usly enjoys
The little woman gave a chirrup at the birds and to the skippers
utter astonishment both Port and Starboard chirruped back sociably
Port then remarked Pretty Polly Starboard chirruped a few cheery
bars from A Sailors Wife a Sailors Star Should Be Then both
parrots rapped their beaks genially against the bars of the cages
and beamed on the lady with their little button eyes
Well I swow ejaculated the Capn rubbing his knurly forefinger
under his nose and glancing first at the parrots and then at the
lady If that aint as much of an astonisher as when the scuttlebutt
danced a jig on the dogvane Them two usly cusses strangers no
matter what age or sect They was learnt to do it He gazed
doubtfully at the birds as though they might possibly be
deteriorating in the effeminacies of shore life
I always was a great hand with pets of all kinds said the lady
modestly Animals seem to take to me sort of naturally I hear you
have long followed the sea Capn SproulI believe thats the name
Capn Sproul
Sproul it is maamAaron for foreriggin Them as said I follered
the sea was nearer than shorefolks usly be Took my dunnage aboard
at fourteen master at twentyfour keelhauled by rheumatiz at
fiftysixwouldnt be here if it wasnt for that I aint stuck on
a pennyflippin job of this sort
I should think it would be very pleasant after all the storms and
the tossings And yet the seathe sea the glorious seahas always
had a great fascination for meeven though Ive never seen it
Nevnevnever seen salt water This amazedly
Never This sadly Ive been keptIve stayed very closely at
my home Being a single lady Ive had no one to talk to me or take
me about I have read books about the ocean but Ive never had any
chance to hear a real and truly mariner tell about the wonderful waste
of waters and describe foreign countries I suppose you have been
way way out to sea Capn Sproulacross the ocean I mean
She had timidly edged up and taken one of the chairs on the porch
gazing about her at the curios
Well maam remarked the Capn dryly as he seated himself in
another chair Ive waded across a cove wunst or twice at low water
I should love so to hear a mariner talk of his adventures I have
never had much chance to talk with any manI mean any sailor I have
been keptI mean I have stayed very closely at home all my life
It broadens a man it sartain does to travel said the skipper
furtively slipping a sliver of tobacco into his cheek and clearing
his throat preparatory to yarning a bit The frank admiration and
trustful innocence in the eyes of the pretty woman touched him
I suppose you have been out at sea in some awful storms Capn I
often think of the sailormen at sea when the snow beats against the
window and the winds howl around the corner
The wust blow I ever remember began the skipper leaning back
and hooking his brown hands behind his head like a basket was my
second trip to Bonis Airisgeneral cargo out to fetch back hides
It was that trip we found the shark that had starved to death and
that was a story that was worth speakin of It
There was a hoarse bellow of Giddap up behind the willows Then
into sight came galloping the tall gaunt horse of Colonel Gideon
Ward The Colonel stood up smacking his whip
With one leap the Capn was at his rope and began to haul in hand
over hand
The big gate at the mouth of the bridge squalled on its rusty hinges
You mustnt shut that gateyou mustnt shrieked the little woman
She ran and clutched at his sturdy arms Thats my brother thats
coming Youll break his neck
The gate was already half shut and the doughty skipper kept on
pulling at the rope
Cant help it maam if its the apostle Paul he gritted There
aint nobody goin to run toll on this bridge
It will kill him
Its him thats lickin that hoss Taint me
Its my brother I tell you She tried to drag the rope out of his
hands but he shook her off pulled the big gate shut set his teeth
clung to the rope and waited
The rush down the hill had been so impetuous and the horse was now
running so madly under the whip that there was no such thing as
checking him With a crash of splintering wood he drove breaston
against the gate throwing up his bony head at the end of his scraggy
neck At the crash the woman screamed and covered her eyes But the
outfit was too much of a catapult to be stopped Through the gate
it went and the wagon roared away through the bridge the driver
yelling oaths behind him
Capn Aaron Sproul walked out and strolled among the scattered debris
kicking it gloomily to right and left The woman followed him
It was awful she half sobbed
So youre Miss Jane Ward be ye he growled glancing at her from
under his knotted eyebrows Speakin of your pets I should reckon
that ere brother of yourn want one that you had tamed down fit
to be turned loose But you tell him for me the next time you see
him that Ill plug the end of that bridge against him if it takes
evry dum cent of the propty Im wuthand thats thutty thousand
dollars if its a cent I aint none of your twocent chaps he
roared visiting his wrath vicariously on her as a representative
of the family Ive got money of my own Your brother seems to have
made doormats outn most of the folks round here but Ill tell ye
that hes wiped his feet on me for the last time You tell him that
dum him
Her face was white and her eyes were shining as she looked at him
Gideon has always had his own way Capn Sproul she faltered I
hope you wont feel too bitter against him It would be awfulhe
so headstrongand you sosobrave She choked this last out
unclasping her hands
Well I aint no coward and I never was blurted the Capn
Its the bravest man that overcomes himself she said Now you
have good judgment Capn My brother is hotheaded Every one knows
that you are a brave man You can afford to let him go over the bridge
without
Never the skipper howled in his best sea tones Youre the last
woman to coax and beg for him if half what they tell me is true
He has abused you wussn he has any one else If you and the rest
aint got any spunk I have Youll be one brother out if he comes
slambangin this way agin
She looked at him appealingly for a moment then tiptoed over the
fragments of the gate and hurried away through the bridge
You aint no ironclad Kunl Ward muttered Sproul Ill hold
ye next time
He set to work on the riverbank that afternoon cutting saplings
trusting to the squall of the faithful parrots to signal the approach
of passers
But the next day when he was nailing the saplings to make a truly
Brobdingnagian grid one of the directors of the bridge company
appeared to him
Were not giving you license to let any one run toll on this bridge
you understand said the director but this fighting Colonel Ward
with our property is another matter Its like fighting a bear with
your fists And even if you killed the bear the hide wouldnt be
worth the damage He has got too many ways of hurting us Capn He
has always had his own way in these parts and he probably always
will Let him go We wont get the toll nor the fines but well
have our bridge left
I was thinking of resigning this job returned the Capn it was
not stirrin enough for a seafarin man but Im sort of gittin
intrested How much will ye take for your bridge
But the director curtly refused to sell
All right then said the skipper chocking his axe viciously into
a sapling birch and leaving it there Ill fill away on another
tack
For the next two weeks as though to exult in his victory the Colonel
made many trips past the tollhouse
He hurled much violent language at the Capn The Capn reinforced
with his vociferous parrots returned the language with great
enthusiasm and volubility
Then came the day once more when the little woman sat down in a chair
in the shade of the woodbine
I took the first chance Capn while my brother has gone upcountry
to come to tell you how much I appreciate your generous way of doing
what I asked of you You are the first man that ever put away selfish
pride and did just what I asked
The seaman started to repudiate vigorously but looked into her
brimming eyes a moment choked and was silent
Yes sir youre what I call noble not to pay any attention to the
boasts my brother is making of how he has backed you down
He is is he The Capn rolled up his lip and growled
But I know just how brave you are to put down all your anger at
the word of a poor woman And a true gentleman too There are only
a few real gentlemen in the world after all
The Capn slid his thumb into the armhole of his waistcoat and swelled
his chest out a little
There was no man ever come it over me and some good ones have tried
it maam So fur as women goes I aint never been married but I
reckon I know what politeness to a lady means
She smiled at him brightly and with such earnest admiration that
he felt a flush crawling up from under his collar He blinked at her
and looked away Starboard with an embarrassing aptness that is
sometimes displayed by children whistled a few bars of A Sailors
Wife a Sailors Star Should Be
I dont mind owning up to you that my brother has imposed upon me
in a great many ways said the little lady her eyes flashing I
have endured a good deal from him because he is my brother I know
just how you feel about him Capn and thats why it makes me feel
that we have aa sort of what you might call common interest I dont
know why Im talking so frankly with you who are almost a stranger
but Ive beenI have always lacked friends so much that now I cant
seem to help it You truly do seem like an old friend you have been
so willing to do what I asked of you after you had time to think
it over
The Capn was now congratulating himself that he hadnt blurted out
anything about the bridge director and that sapling fence It
certainly was a grateful soundthat praise from the pretty lady
He didnt want to interrupt it
Now will you go on with that story of the storm she begged
hitching the chair a bit nearer I want to hear about your
adventures
She had all the instincts of Desdemona did that pretty little lady
Three times that week she came to the tollhouse and listened with
lips apart and eyes shining Capn Sproul had never heard of Othello
and his wooing but after a time his heart began to glow under the
reverent regard she bent on him Never did mutual selection more
naturally come about She loved him for the perils he had braved
and herobbed of his mistress the seayearned for just such
companionship as she was giving him He had known that life lacked
something This was it
And when one day after a stuttering preamble that lasted a full half
hour he finally blurted out his hearthankering she wept a little
while on his shoulderit being luckily a time when there was no one
passingand then sobbingly declared it could never be
Fraid of your brother hey he inquired
She bumped her forehead gently on his shoulder in nod of assent
I reckon ye like me
Oh Aaron It was a volume of rebuke appeal and affection in two
words
Then there aint nothin more to say little woman You aint never
had any one to look out for your intrests in this life After this
its me that does it I dont want your money Ive got plenty of
my own But your interests bein my interests after this you hand
evrything over to me and Ill put a twist in the tail of that Bengal
tiger in your famly that ll last him all his life
At the end of a long talk he sent her away with a pat on her shoulder
and a cheery word in her ear
It was Old Man Jordan who a week or so later on his way to the village
with butter in his bucket stood in the middle of the road and tossed
his arms so frenziedly that Colonel Ward gathering up his speed
behind the willows pulled up with an oath
Yere jest gittin back from upcountry aint ye asked Uncle
Jordan
What do you mean you old fool by stoppin me when Im busy What
be ye gittin items for newspapers
No Kunl Ward but Ive got some news that I thought ye might like
to hear before ye went past the tollhouse this time Intentions
between Capn Aaron Sproul and Miss Jane Ward has been published
Whaaat
They were married yistiddy
Wha The cry broke into inarticulateness
The Capn aint goin to be tollman after today Says hes goin
to live on the home place with his wife There Uncle Jordan stepped
to one side just in time for the gaunt horse sprung under the lash
as though he had the wings of Pegasus
The Capn was sitting in front of the tollhouse The tall horse
galloped down the hill but the Colonel stood up and with elbows
akimbo and hands under his chin yanked the animal to a standstill
his splay feet skating through the highway dust The Colonel leaped
over the wheel and reversed his heavy whipbutt The Capn stood up
gripping a stout cudgel that he had been whittling at for many hours
While the new arrival was choking with an awful word that he was
trying his best to work out of his throat the Capn pulled his little
notebook out of his pocket and slowly drawled
I reckoned as how ye might find time to stop some day and Ive got
your account all figgered You owe thirteen tolls at ten cents each
one thutty and thirteen times three dollars finethe whole
amountin to jest forty dollars and thutty cents Then theres a gate
to
Im goin to kill you right in your tracks where you stand bellowed
the Colonel
The Capn didnt wait for the attack He leaped down off his porch
and advanced with the fierce intrepidity of a sea tyrant
Youll pay that toll bill he gritted if I have to pick it out
of your pockets whilst the coroner is settin on your remains
The bully of the countryside quailed
Youve stole my sister he screamed This aint about toll Im
talkin Youve been and robbed me of my sister
Do you want to hear a word on that demanded the Capn grimly
He came close up whirling the cudgel Youre an old cheap
ploughedland blowhard thats what you are Youve cuffed round
hired men and abused weak wimmenfolks I knowed you was a coward
when I got that line on ye You dont dast to stand up to a man like
me Ill split your head for a cent He kept advancing step by step
his mien absolutely demoniac Ive married your sister because she
wanted me Now Im goin to take care of her Ive got thutty thousand
dollars of my own and shes giv me power of attorney over hers
Ill take every cent of what belongs to her out of your business
and I know enough of the way that your business is tied up to know
that I can crowd you right to the wall Now do ye want to fight
The tyrants face grew sickly white for he realized all that threat
meant
