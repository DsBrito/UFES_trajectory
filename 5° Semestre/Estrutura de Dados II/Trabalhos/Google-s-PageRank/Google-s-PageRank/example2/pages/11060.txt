in sacerdotal vestments lifting the monstrance in the vaulted
choir censed by the beating wings of halfseen Cherubim And she
would tremble awestruck as if she were the mother of a god this
poor sick workwoman whose puling child lay beside her drooping
in the poisoned air of a backshop
But for the nonce on mothers breast
My sweet boybishop take thy rest
One evening as her husband handed her a cooling drink she said
to him in a tone of regret
Why did you disturb me I could see the Holy Virgin among flowers
and precious stones and lights It was so beautiful so beautiful
She said she was no longer in pain that she wished her Jean to
learn Latin And she passed away
II
The widower who from the Beauce country sent his son to his
native village in the EureetLoir to be brought up by kinsfolk
there As for himself he was a strong man and soon learned
to be resigned he was of a saving habit by instinct in both
business and family matters and never put off the green serge
apron from weeks end to weeks end save for a Sunday visit to
the cemetery He would hang a wreath on the arm of the black
cross and if it was a hot day take a chair on the way back
along the boulevard outside the door of a wineshop There as he
sat slowly emptying his glass his eye would rest on the mothers
and their youngsters going by on the sidewalk
These young wives as he watched them approach and pass on were
so many passing reminders of his Clotilde and made him feel sad
without his quite understanding why for he was not much given
to thinking
Time slipped by and little by little his dead wife grew to be a
tender vague memory in the bookbinders mind One night he tried
in vain to recall Clotildes features after this experience
he told himself that perhaps he might be able to discover the
mothers lineaments in the childs face and he was seized with
a great longing to see this relic of the lost one once more
to have the child home again
In the morning he wrote a letter to his old sister Mademoiselle
Servien begging her to come and take up her abode with the little
one in the Rue NotreDame des Champs The sister who had lived
for many years in Paris at her brothers expense for indolence
was her ruling passion agreed to resume her life in a city where
she used to say folks are free and need not depend on their
neighbours
One autumn evening she arrived at the Gare de lOuest with Jean
and her boxes and baskets an upright hardfeatured fierceeyed
figure all ready to defend the child against all sorts of
imaginary perils The bookbinder kissed the lad and expressed his
satisfaction in two words
Then he lifted him pickaback on his shoulders and bidding him
hold on tight to his fathers hair carried him off proudly to
the house
Jean was seven Soon existence settled down to a settled routine
At midday the old dame would don her shawl and set off with the
child in the direction of Grenelle
The pair followed the broad thoroughfares that ran between shabby
walls and redfronted drinkingshops Generally speaking a sky
of a dappled grey like the great carthorses that plodded past
invested the quiet suburb with a gentle melancholy Establishing
herself on a bench while the child played under a tree she would
knit her stocking and chat with an old soldier and tell him her
troubleswhat a hard life it was in other peoples houses
One day one of the last fine days of the season Jean squatted
on the ground was busy sticking up bits of planetree bark in
the fine wet sand That faculty of pretending by which children
are able to make their lives one unending miracle transformed a
handful of soil and a few bits of wood into wondrous galleries and
fairy castles to the lads imagination he clapped his hands and
leapt for joy Then suddenly he felt himself wrapped in something
soft and scented It was a ladys gown he saw nothing except
that she smiled as she put him gently out of her way and walked
on He ran to tell his aunt
How good she smells that lady
Mademoiselle Servien only muttered that great ladies were no
better than others and that she thought more of herself with
her merino skirt than all those setup minxes in their flounces
and finery adding
Better a good name than a gilt girdle
But this talk was beyond little Jeans comprehension The perfumed
silk that had swept his face left behind a vague sweetness a
memory as of a gentle ghostly caress
III
One evening in summer the bookbinder was enjoying the fresh air
before his door when a big man with a red nose past middle age and
wearing a scarlet waistcoat stained with greasespots appeared
bowing politely and confidentially and addressed him in a singsong
voice in which even Monsieur Servien could detect an Italian
accent
Sir I have translated the Gerusalemme Liberata the immortal
masterpiece of Torquato Tassoand a bulging packet of manuscript
under his arm confirmed the statement
Yes sir I have devoted sleepless nights to this glorious and
ungrateful task Without family or fatherland I have written my
translation in dark icecold garrets on chandlers wrappers
snuff papers the backs of playing cards Such has been the exiles
task You sir you live in your own land in the bosom of a
happy familyat least I hope so
This speech which impressed him by its magniloquence and its
strangeness set the bookbinder dreaming of the dead woman he
had loved and he saw her in his minds eye coiling her beautiful
hair as in the early days of their married life
The big man proceeded
Man is like a plant which perishes when the storms uproot it
Here is your son is it not so He is like youand laying
his hand on Jeans head who clung to his fathers coattails
in wonder at the red waistcoat and the singsong voice he asked
if the child learned his lessons well if he was growing up to
be a clever man if he would not soon be beginning Latin
That noble language he added whose inimitable monuments have
often made me forget my misfortunes
Yes sir I have often breakfasted on a page of Tacitus and supped
on a satire of Juvenal
As he said the words a look of sadness overspread his shining
red face and dropping his voice
Forgive me sir if I hold out to you the casque of Belisarius
I am the Marquis Tudesco of Venice When I have received from
the bookseller the price of my labour I will not forget that
you succoured me with a small coin in the time of my sharpest
trial
The bookbinder casehardened as he was against beggars who
on winter evenings drifted into his shop with the east wind
nevertheless experienced a certain sympathy and respect for the
Marquis Tudesco He slipped a francpiece into his hand
Thereupon the old Italian like a man inspired exclaimed
One Nation there is that is unhappyItaly one generous
PeopleFrance and one bond that unites the twainhumanity
Ah chiefest of the virtues humanity humanity
Meantime the bookbinder was pondering his wifes last words I
wish my Jean to learn Latin He hesitated till seeing Monsieur
Tudesco bowing and smiling to go
Sir he said if you are ready two or three times a week
to give the boy lessons in French and Latin we might come to
terms
The Marquis Tudesco expressed no surprise He smiled and said
Certainly sir as you wish it I shall find it a delightful
task to initiate your son in the mysteries of the Latin rudiments
We will make a man of him and a good citizen and God knows
what heights my pupil will scale in this noble land of freedom
and generosity He may one day be ambassador my dear sir I
say it knowledge is power
You will know the shop again said the bookbinder there is
my name on the signboard
The Marquis Tudesco after tweaking the sons ear amicably and
bowing to the father with a dignified familiarity walked away
with a step that was still jaunty
IV
The Marquis Tudesco returned in due course smiled at Mademoiselle
Servien who darted poisonous looks at him greeted the bookbinder
with a discreet air of patronage and had a supply of grammars
and dictionaries bought
At first he gave his lessons with exemplary regularity He had
taken a liking to these repetitions of nouns and verbs which he
listened to with a dignified condescending air slowly unrolling
his screw of snuff the while he only interrupted to interject
little playful remarks with a geniality just touched with a trace
of ferocity that bespoke his real nature as an unctuous cringing
bully He was jocular and pompous at the same time and always
made a pretence of being a long time in seeing the glass of wine
put on the table for his refreshment
The bookbinder regarding him as a clever man of illregulated
life always treated him with great consideration for faults
of behaviour almost cease to shock us except among neighbours
or at most fellowcountrymen Without knowing it Jean found a
fund of amusement in the witticisms and harangues of his old
teacher who united in himself the contradictory attributes of
highpriest and buffoon He was great at telling a story and
though his tales were beyond the childs intelligence they did
not fail to leave behind a confused impression of recklessness
irony and cynicism Mademoiselle Servien alone never relaxed her
attitude of uncompromising dislike and disdain She said nothing
against him but her face was a rigid mask of disapproval her
eyes two flames of fire in answer to the courteous greeting
the tutor never failed to offer her with a special roll of his
little grey eyes
One day the Marquis Tudesco walked into the shop with a staggering
gait his eyes glittered and his mouth hung half open in anticipation
of racy talk and selfindulgence while his great nose his pink
cheeks his fat loose hands and his big belly gallantly carried
gave him beneath his jacket and felt hat a perfect likeness to
a little rustic god his ancestors worshipped the old Silenus
Lessons that day were fitful and haphazard Jean was repeating
in a drawling voice moneo mones monet  monebam monebas
monebat Suddenly Monsieur Tudesco sprang forward dragging
his chair along the floor with a horrid screech and clapping
his hand on his pupils shoulder
Child he said today I am going to give you a more profitable
lesson than all the pitiful teaching I have confined myself to
up to now
It is a lesson of transcendental philosophy Hearken carefully
child If one day you rise above your station and come to know
yourself and the world about you you will discover this that
men act only out of regard for the opinion of their fellowsand
per Bacco they are consummate fools for their pains They
dread other folks blame and crave their approval
The idiots fail to see that the world does not care a straw
for them and that their dearest friends will see them glorified
or disgraced without missing one mouthful of their dinner This
is my lesson caro figliuolo that the worlds opinion is not
worth the sacrifice of a single one of our desires If you get
this into your pate you will be a strong man and can boast you
were once the pupil of the Marquis Tudesco of Venice the exile
who has translated in a freezing garret on scraps of refuse
paper the immortal poem of Torquato Tasso What a task
The child listened to the tipsy philosopher without understanding
one word of his rigmarole only Monsieur Tudesco struck him as
a strange and alarming personage and taller by a hundred feet
than anybody he had ever seen before
The professor warmed to his subject
Ah he cried springing from his seat and what profit did
the immortal and illstarred Torquato Tasso win from all his
genius A few stolen kisses on the steps of a palace And he
died of famine in a madhouse I say it the worlds opinion
that empress of humankind I will tear from her her crown and
sceptre Opinion tyrannizes over unhappy Italy as over all the
earth Italy what flaming sword will one day come to break her
fetters as now I break this chair
In fact he had seized his chair by the back and was pounding
it fiercely on the floor
But suddenly he stopped gave a knowing smile and said in a low
voice
No no Marquis Tudesco let be let Venice be a prey to Teuton
savagery The fetters of the fatherland are daily bread to the
exiled patriot
His chin buried in his cravat he stood chuckling to himself
and his red waistcoat rose and fell in jerks
Mademoiselle Servien who sat by at the lesson knitting a stocking
and for some moments had been watching the tutor her spectacles
pushed halfway up her forehead with a look of amazement and
suspicion exclaimed as if talking to herself
If it isnt abominable to come to peoples houses in drink
Monsieur Tudesco did not seem to hear her His manner was quiet
and jocular again
Child he ordered write down the theme for an essay Write
down The worst thing yes the worst thing of all write
it down is an old woman with a spiteful temper
And rising with the gracious dignity of a Prince of the Church
he bowed low to the aunt gave the nephews cheek a friendly
tap and marched out of the room
However beginning with the very next lesson he lavished every
mark of respect on the old lady and treated her to all his choicest
airs and graces rounding his elbows pursing his lips strutting
and swaggering She would not relax a muscle and sat there as
silent and sulky as an owl
But one day when she was hunting for her spectacles as she was
always doing Monsieur Tudesco offered her his and persuaded her
to try them she found they suited her sight and felt a trifle
less unamiable towards him The Italian pursuing his advantage
got into talk with her and artfully turned the conversation upon
the vices of the rich The old lady approved his sentiments and
an exchange of petty confidences ensued Tudesco knew a sovereign
remedy for catarrh and this too was well received He redoubled
his attentions and the concierge who saw him smiling to himself
on the doorstep told Aunt Servien The mans in love with you
Of course she declared At my time of life a woman doesnt want
lovers but her vanity was tickled all the same Monsieur Tudesco
got what he wantedto have his glass filled to the brim every
lesson Out of politeness they would even leave him the pint jug
only half empty which he was indiscreet enough to drain dry
One day he asked for a taste of cheesejust enough to make
a mouses dinner was his expression Mice are like me they
love the dark and a quiet life and books and like me they live
on crumbs
This pose of the wise man fallen on evil days made a bad impression
and the old lady became silent and sombre as before
When springtime came Monsieur Tudesco vanished
V
The bookbinder for all his scanty earnings was resolved to
enter Jean at a school where the boy could enjoy a regular and
complete course of instruction He selected a dayschool not
far from the Luxembourg because he could see the top branches
of an acacia overtopping the wall and the house had a cheerful
look
Jean as a little new boy he was now eleven was some weeks
before he shook off the shyness with which his schoolfellows
loud voices and rough ways and his masters ponderous gravity
had at first overwhelmed him Little by little he grew used to
the work and learned some of the tricks by means of which
punishments were avoided his schoolfellows found him so inoffensive
they left off stealing his cap and initiated him in the game of
marbles But he had little love for schoollife and when five
oclock came prayers were over and his satchel strapped it
was with unfeigned delight he dashed out into the street basking
in the golden rays of the setting sun In the intoxication of
freedom he danced and leapt seeing everything men and horses
carriages and shops in a charmed light and out of sheer joy of
life mumbling at his Aunt Serviens hand and arm as she walked
home with him carrying the satchel and lunchbasket
The evening was a peaceful time Jean would sit drawing pictures
or dreaming over his copybooks at one end of the table where
Mademoiselle Servien had just cleared away the meal His father
would be busy with a book As age advanced he had acquired a
taste for reading his favourites being La Fontaines Fables
Anquetils History of France and Voltaires Dictionnaire
Philosophique to get the hang of things as he put it
His sister made fruitless efforts to distract his attention with
some stinging criticism of the neighbours or a question about
our fat friend who had not come back for she made a point
of never remembering the Marquis Tudescos name
VI
Before long Jeans whole mind was given over to the catechizings
and sermons and hymns preparatory to the First Communion
Intoxication with the music of chants and organ drowned in the
scent of incense and flowers hung about with scapularies rosaries
consecrated medals and holy images he like his companions assumed
a certain air of selfimportance and wore a smug sanctified look
He was cold and unbending towards his aunt who spoke with far
too much unconcern about the great day Though she had long
been in the habit of taking her nephew to Mass every Sunday
she was not pious Most likely she confounded in one common
detestation the luxury of the rich and the pomps of the Church
service She had more than once been overheard informing one
of the cronies she used to meet on the boulevards that she was
a religious woman but she could not abide priests that she
said her prayers at home and these were every bit as good as
the fine ladies who flaunted their crinolines in church His
father was more in sympathy with the lads newfound zeal he
was interested and even a little impressed He undertook to bind
a missal with his own hands against the ceremony
When the days arrived for retreats and general confessions Jean
swelled with pride and vague aspirations He looked for something
out of the ordinary to happen Coming out at evening from
SaintSulpice with two or three of his schoolfellows he would
feel an atmosphere of miracle about him some divine interposition
must be forthcoming The lads used to tell each other strange
stories pious legends they had read in one of their little books
of devotion Now it was a phantom monk who had stepped out of the
grave showing the stigmata on hands and feet and the pierced
side now a nun beautiful as the veiled figures in the Church
pictures expiating in the fires of hell mysterious sins Jean
had his favourite tale Shuddering he would relate how St
Francis Borgia after the death of Queen Isabella who was lovely
beyond compare must have the coffin opened wherein she lay at rest
in her robe embroidered with pearls in imagination he pictured
the dead Queen invested her form with all the magic hues of the
unknown traced in her lineaments the enchantments of a womans
beauty in the dark gulf of death And as he told the tale he could
hear in the twilight gloom a murmur of soft voices sighing in
the plane trees of the Luxembourg
The great day arrived The bookbinder who attended the ceremony
with his sister thought of his wife and wept
He was most favourably impressed by the cures homily in which
a young man without faith was compared to an unbridled charger
that plunges over precipices The simile struck his fancy and
he would quote it years after with approbation He made up his
mind to read the Bible as he had read Voltaire to get the
hang of things
Jean withdrew from the houselling cloth wondering to be just
the same as ever and already disillusioned He was never again
to recover the first fervent rapture
VII
The holidays were near An noon of a blazing hot day Jean was
seated in the shade on the dwarfwall that bounded the school
count towards the headmasters garden He was playing languidly
at shovelboard with a schoolfellow a lad as pretty as a girl
with his curls and his jacket of white duck
Ewans said Jean as he pushed a pebble along one of the lines
drawn in charcoal on the stone coping Ewans you must find
it tiresome to be a boarder
Mother cannot have me with her at home replied the boy
Servien asked why
Oh Because stammered Ewans
He stared a long time at the white pebble he held in his hand
ready to play before he added
My mother goes travelling
And your father
He is in America I have never seen him Youve lost Lets begin
again
Servien who felt interested in Madame Ewans because of the superb
boxes of chocolates she used to bring to school for her boy
put another question
You love her very much your mother I mean
Of course I do cried the other adding presently
You must come and see me one day in the holidays at home Youll
find our house is very pretty theres sofas and cushions no end
But you must not put off for we shall be off to the seaside
soon
At this moment a servant a tall thin man appeared in the
playground and called out something which the shrill cries of
their companions at play prevented the two seated on the wall
from hearing A fat boy standing by himself with his face to
the wall with the unconcern born of long familiarity with this
form of punishment clapped his two hands to his mouth trumpetwise
and shrieked
Ewans youre wanted in the parlour
The usher marched up
Garneret he ordered you will stand half an hour this evening
at preparation speaking when you were forbidden to Ewans go
to the parlour
The latter clapped his hands and danced for joy telling his friend
Its my mother Ill tell her you are coming to our house
Servien reddened with pleasure and stammered out that he would
ask his fathers leave But Ewans had already scampered across
the yard leaving a dusty furrow behind him
Leave was readily granted by Monsieur Servien who was fully
persuaded that all boys admitted to so expensive a school born of
welltodo parents whose society could not but prove advantageous
to his sons manners and morals and to his future success in
life
Such information as Jean could give him about Madame Ewans was
extremely vague but the bookbinder was well used to contemplating
the ways of rich folks through a veil of impenetrable mystery
Aunt Servien indulged in sundry observations on the occasion of
a very general kind touching people who ride in carriages Then
she repeated a story about a great lady who just like Madame
Ewans had put her son to boardingschool and who was mixed up
in a case of illicit commissions in the time of LouisPhilippe
She added to clinch the matter that the cowl does not make
the monk that she thought herself for all she did not wear
flowers in her hat a more honest woman than your society ladies
false jades everyone concluding with her pet proverb Better
a good name than a gilt girdle
Jean had never seen a gilt girdle but he thought in a vague way
he would very much like to have one
The holidays came and one Thursday after breakfast his aunt
produced a white waistcoat from the wardrobe and Jean dressed
in his Sunday best climbed on an omnibus which took him to the
Rue de Rivoli He mounted four flights of a staircase the carpet
and polished brass stairrods of which filled him with surprise
and admiration
On reaching the landing he could hear the tinkling of a piano
He rang the bell blushed hotly and was sorry he had rung He
would have given worlds to run away A maidservant opened the
door and behind her stood Edgar Ewans wearing a brown holland
suit in which he looked entirely at his ease
Come along he cried and dragged him into a drawingroom into
which the halfdrawn curtains admitted shafts of sunlight that
were flashed back in countless broken reflections from mirrors
and gilt cornices A sweet stimulating perfume hung about the
room which was crowded with a superabundance of padded chairs
and couches and piles of cushions
In the halflight jean beheld a lady so different from all he had
ever set eyes on till that moment that he could form no notion of
what she was no idea of her beauty or her age Never had he seen
eyes that flashed so vividly in a face of such pale fairness or
lips so red smiling with such an unvarying almost tiredlooking
smile She was sitting at a piano idly strumming on the keys
without playing any definite tune What drew Jeans eyes above
all was her hair arranged in some fashion that struck him with
a sense of mystery and beauty
She looked round and smoothing the lace of her peignoir with
one hand
You are Edgars friend she asked in a cordial tone though
her voice struck Jean as harsh in this beautiful room that was
perfumed like a church
Yes Madame
You like being at school
Yes madame
The masters are not too strict
No Madame
You have no mother
As she put the question Madame Evans voice softened
No Madame
What is your father
A bookbinder Madameand the bookbinders son blushed as he
gave the answer At that moment he would gladly have consented
never to see his father more his father whom he loved if by
the sacrifice he could have passed for the son of a Captain in
the Navy or a Secretary of Embassy He suddenly remembered that
one of his fellowpupils was the son of a celebrated physician
whose portrait was displayed in the stationers windows
If only he had had a father like that to tell Madame Ewans of
But that was out of the questionand how cruelly unjust it was
He felt ashamed of himself as if he had said something shocking
But his friends mother seemed quite unaffected by the dreadful
avowal She was still moving her hands at random up and down
the keyboard Then presently
You must enjoy yourself finely today boys she cried We
will all go out Shall I take you to the fair at SaintCloud
Yes Edgar was all for going because of the roundabouts
Madame Ewans rose from the piano patted her pale flaxen hair
in place with a pretty gesture and gave a sidelong look in the
mirror as she passed
Im going to dress she told them I shall not be long
While she was dressing Edgar sat at the piano trying to pick
out a tune from an opera bouffe and Jean perched uncomfortably
on the edge of his chair stared about the room at a host of
strange and sumptuous objects that seemed in some mysterious
way to be part and parcel of their beautiful owner and affected
him almost as strangely as she herself had done
Preceded by a faint waft of scent and a rustle of silk she
reappeared tying the strings of the hat that made a dainty diadem
above her smiling eyes
Edgar looked at her curiously
Why mother theres something I dont know what   something
that alters you
She glanced in the mirror examining her hair which showed pale
violet shadows amid the flaxen plaits
Oh its nothing she said only I have put some powder in
my hair Like the Empress she added and broke into another
smile
As she was drawing on her gloves a ring was heard and the maid
came in to tell her mistress that Monsieur Delbeque was waiting
to see her
Madame Ewans pouted and declared she could not receive him whereupon
the maid spoke a few words in a very peremptory whisper Madame
Ewans shrugged her shoulders
Stay where you are she told the boys and passed into the
diningroom whence the murmur of two voices could presently be
heard
Jean asked Edgar under his breath who the gentleman was
Monsieur Delbeque Edgar informed him He keeps horses and a
