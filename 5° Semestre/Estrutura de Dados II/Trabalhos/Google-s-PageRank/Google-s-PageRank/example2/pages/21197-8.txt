Preface
The purpose of this translation of Collados Ars Grammaticae Iaponicae
Linguae of 1632 is to make more readily available to the scholarly
community an annotated version of this significant document in the history
of both Japanese language study and grammatical description in general
Collados work derived in all its significant features from the Arte da
lingoa de Iapam completed in 1608 by Joao Rodriguez is in a strict
scholarly sense less valuable than its precursor However if used with the
Arte as a simplified restatement of the basic structure of the language
Collados Grammar offers to the student of the Japanese language an
invaluable ancillary tool for the study of the colloquial language of the
early 17th Century
While less extensive and less carefully edited than the Arte Collados
Grammar has much to recommend it as a document in the history of
grammatical description It is an orthodox description attempting to fit
simple Japanese sentences into the framework established for Latin by the
great Spanish humanist Antonio Lebrija Thus as an application of
preCartecian grammatical theory to the structure of a nonIndoEuropean
language the Ars Grammaticae is an important document worthy of careful
examination by those wishing insight into the origins of what three
centuries later was to become the purview of descriptive linguistics
The present translation was begun with the able assistance of Ms Roberta
Galli whose contribution to my understanding of the Latin text is most
gratefully acknowledged For his continued encouragement in this
undertaking I am grateful to Professor Roy Andrew Miller Thanks are also
due to the Graduate School of the University of Kansas for its support in
the preparation of the manuscript and to Ms Sue Schumock whose capable
typing turned a scribbled multilingual draft into a legible manuscript

Introduction
In 1632 as the Christian Century in Japan was drawing swiftly to a close
three works pertaining to the Japanese language were being published at
Rome by the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith These works were
by the Spanish Dominican Father Diego Collado d 1638 who had spent the
years from 1619 to 1622 in Japan Their publication clearly reflects the
vitality of the missionary spirit in that age as well as the important
place reserved for language study in the propagation of the faith
The first two works whose manuscripts had been prepared in Madrid the year
before were a grammar and a dictionary of Japanese The third prepared in
1631 while the larger works were being seen through the press was a guide
to the taking of confession written in both Latin and Japanese1 The
grammar drafted in Spanish was published in Latin in 1632 under the title
Ars Grammaticae Iaponicae Linguae It is this work that is translated
here The dictionary only at the last moment supplied with Latin glosses
to supplement those in Spanish was published in the same year with the
title Dictionarium sive Thesauri Linguae Iaponicae Compendium2 Taken
together these three works by Collado constitute the final extant efforts
of those who studied the Japanese language first hand during the Christian
Century3
Two other grammatical works must be mentioned here as central to the proper
assessment of Collados Grammar They are both by the great Jesuit scholar
Father Joao Rodnguez 156116344 the Arte da Lingoa de Iapam
Nagasaki 16048 hereafter the Arte and the Arte Breve da Lingoa
Iapoa Macao 1620 hereafter Arte Breve The first 2 is by any
standards the greatest grammatical study of Japanese made during the
Christian Century It is further as we shall see the primary source for
Collados Grammar The Arte Breve on the other hand is not directly
related to Collados work Indeed it is clear that Rodriguez 1620 Macao
publication was unknown to Collado Nevertheless since the Arte Breve is
an abbreviated version of the Arte with a purpose similar to the Ars
Grammaticae a comparison of these two books with respect to the way they
systematize the material from the Arte is included in this introduction
to contribute some insight into the treatment of the Japanese language at
the beginning of the Tokugawa Period
In presenting this translation two potential audiences are envisioned The
first and more restricted group is that having an interest in the history
of the Japanese language It is hoped that an English version of this work
will make more readily available this significant material pertaining to
the Japanese language as spoken in the early modern period I use the word
significant here to avoid granting excessive value to a work which derives
such a large portion of its material and insight from Rodriguez Arte
The second and wider group for whom this translation is intended is that
which has a need for an edited edition of an important document in the
history of grammatical description In this area of scholarship Collados
work is of more than moderate significance It was accepted for publication
by the prestigious Propaganda Press and even if those more familiar with
Japanese than the editorial board of that Press might have had serious
reservations concerning the linguistic accuracy of the text it is
reasonable to assume that the Press judged it to be a good example of
grammatical description It thus represents a grammar of a nonEuropean
language which suited the requirements of the day for publication at
Rome5
3
In order to permit this translation of the Ars Grammaticae to be of use
in both these areas of scholarship I have made an effort to reduce to a
minimum those places where a knowledge of either Japanese or Latin is
required for the comprehension of the translation It is sincerely hoped
that the result is not an effort that is satisfying to neither and thus to
no one
Because of the derivative nature of the text this translation has put
aside a number of important philological problems as better dealt with
within the context of Rodriguez grammars This decision has its most
obvious consequences in the section on the arithmetic where innumerable
data require exposition However since a basic purpose of this translation
is within the context of the history of descriptive grammar these
tantalizing side roads have been left unexplored It is nevertheless
hoped that this translation will serve as a convenient tool for those
wishing to make a more detailed investigation into the philological
questions raised by the text But I must caution those who would undertake
such an inquiry that they had best begin with a careful study of the works
of Father Rodriguez
With its limitations acknowledged the Ars Grammaticae Iaponicae Linguae
remains a document worthy of our interest and I offer this translation in
order that Collados work may more easily find its proper place in the
history of descriptive grammar
The Grammatical Framework
Collado perceived his task to be the presentation of a grammar of Japanese
which would have sufficient scope to equip those dedicated to the
propagation of the faith with a knowledge of the proper spoken language of
his time While he concludes his grammar with a brief and rather
presumptuous statement concerning the written language his purpose is
clearly to train his students in the fundamentals of colloquial speech His
sensitivity to this point is demonstrated by his carefully transforming
those examples presented by Rodriguez in the written language in the Arte
into correct colloquial expressions in his own grammar
The description is of course prescriptive But given its age and its
purpose this ought not to be construed in the contemporary pejorative 4
sense Collado as Rodriguez and indeed all the grammarians of the period
felt obligated to train their students in those patterns of speech which
were appropriate to the most polite elements of society Particularly as
they addressed themselves to missionaries they wished to warn them away
from such illiteracies as might undermine their capacities to propagate the
faith
The description further reflects the traditional process conceptualization
of language This is particularly obvious in the treatment of the verb
Thus
Praesens subiunctiui fit ex praesenti indicatiui mutato u in quo
finitur in eba The present subjunctive is formed from the present
indicative by changing the u in which it ends to eba p 23
In general each of the verbal forms is conceived to be the result of a
specified alteration of a basic form Likewise the nouns are treated within
the framework of the declension of cases
The treatment of Japanese forms is based upon a semantic framework within
which the formal characteristics of the language are organized For
example given the construction aguru coto aro p 31 and its gloss
Erit hoc quod ist offere idest offeret It will be that he is to offer
or he will offer it is clear that the aguru coto is classified as an
infinitive because of its semantic equivalence to offere The same is
true of the latter supine If the form in Latin is closely associated with
such constructions as easy to or difficult to the semantically
similar form which appears as the element iomi in iominicui difficult
to read must be classed as the latter supine Rodriguez in his Arte
Breve of 1620unknown to Colladomakes an attempt to classify the
structural units of Japanese along more formal lines but in Collados
treatment the semantic and for him logical and true classes established
by the formal structure of Latin constitute the theoretical framework
through which the Japanese language is to be described
Collado makes reference to two specific sources of influence upon his
grammar The first is included in the title to the first section of the
grammar Antonius Nebrissensis It is to this great Spanish humanist 5
better known as Antonio Lebrija 14441522 that Collado turns for the
model of his description
An examination of Lebrijas grammar the Introductiones Latinae
Salamanca 1481 shows that from the basic outline of his presentation
to the organization of subsections and the selection of terminology there
is little departure by Collado from his predecessor
Even in such stylistic devices as introducing the interrogatives by giving
the form following it with to which one responds and then listing a
number of characteristic answers Collado is faithful to the
Introductiones
But it is from his Jesuit colleague Father Joao Rodriguez that Collado
receives his most significant influence There is no section of his grammar
that does not reflect Rodriguez interpretation of the raw linguistic data
of Japanese On the basis of the innumerable examples taken from
Rodriguezmost of the substantive sentences are directly quoted from the
Arteas well as the parallel listing of forms and identical descriptions
of certain grammatical phenomena it is clear that the writing of the Ars
Grammaticae Iaponicae Linguae consisted to no small degree of abridging
the exhaustive material contained in Rodriguez grammar and arranging it
within the framework of Lebrijas Introductiones
To say that Collado followed Lebrija in the general structure of his
description is not to imply that he fell heir to all of his precursors
virtues The Salamanca grammar of 1481 is a masterpiece of orderly
presentation Printed in lettera formata with carefully indented
subdivisions it offers the student a clear display of the conjugational
system as well as long columns of Latin examples of a given grammatical
structure accompanied on the right side of the page with Spanish
equivalents Collado makes little effort at copying this orderly display
There are in his presentation no paradigms but instead only loosely
connected sentences that talk the student through the various forms of the
conjugation and there is no orderly array of examples Add to this the
innumerable factual and typographical errors and one is left with a
presentation that lacks most of the basic scholarly virtues of its
precursor
A similar criticism may be leveled against the work from the point 6 of
view of Rodriguez influence Without matching the Introductiones in
orderliness the Arte more than compensates for its casual format by
containing a mass of exhaustively collected and scrupulously presented
linguistic data6 There was available no better source than the Arte
from which Collado might have culled his examples of Japanese
One doubt that remains in assessing Collados use of Rodriguez material is
that perhaps his presentation of the most readily understandable material
in the Arte is not so much an effort on his part to simplify the learning
of Japanese for his students as it is a reflection of his lack of adequate
familiarity with the language he was teaching
The Phonological System
A study of the phonological data reveals the Ars Grammaticae Iaponicae
Linguae to be of minimal historical value Any student of the phonology of
early modern Japanese should turn to the far more reliable work of Father
Rodriguez Nevertheless certain aspects of Collados transcription require
our attention
The most obvious innovation in the representation of the language is
Collados transcription with an i of the palatal consonant which all his
contemporaries record with a y Thus in the text we find iomi and
coie terms for native words and Chinese borrowings where Rodriguez
writes yomi and coye This change was affected while the text was being
translated from the Spanish manuscript which uses y and Collado himself
must have felt the innovation to be of dubious value since he retained y
for the spellings in the Dictionarium7
Collados handling of the nasal sounds is too inconsistent to be a reliable
source for phonological data Given his rather awkward specification that
nasalization is predictable before what we must assume he means to be the
voiced stops and affricates8 his grammar presents an uncomfortably
irregular pattern in the transcription of the phenomena Thus on page 39
we find vo modori aro ca as well as 7 modori aro ca Again what he
presents as the ending zuba in his description of the formation
of the negative conditional p 34 appears in tovazunba in its only
occurrence in a sample sentence p 62 To further confound the issue such
forms as tovazunba and qinpen occur in contrast to sambiacu
varambe and varabe
In Chart 1 the traditional pattern of the gojuonzu chart of 50
sounds is followed as a convenient framework in which to display the
transcriptional system employed by Collado

In this chart the phonemic grid is presented in a broad phonetic 8
notation while the underlined entries are in the form used by the text
Dashes indicate sequences which do not occur in the Christian material
while the forms in parentheses are sequences which do not occur in the text
but have been reconstructed on the basis of the overall system from
sequences attested to elsewhere The forms ie vo vo and vo have
been placed in brackets to indicate that neither e o oo or au
occur in the syllable initial position and where in the modern language
they do the text regularly spells that with an initial i or v The
forms in eo at the foot of the chart represent sequences that are
phonetically identical to the forms above them but which are transcribed
differently to reflect morphological considerations eg the form agueo
from the stem ague The phonetic values of au uu and ou are
IPA Openmid back rounded vowel u and o
Two aspects of the usage of q should be noticed First as in the Arte
c is changed to q before o and u when the sequence occurs at a
morphological juncture eg ioqu well and iqo I shall go This
rule does not extend to a in such contexts cf iocatta was good
Second in contrast to the system used by Rodriguez Collado does not feel
compelled to follow q with u in all contexts Thus what Rodriguez
spells as queredomo Collado spells as qeredomo Finally the text
records one usage of the letter h in the exclamation ha
The Morphological System
Collados treatment of the morphology contains one quite obvious difference
from those of his predecessors he isolates the particles of the language
as separate elements of the structure While his effort is more or less
carelessly maintained by the type setter his attempt to establish a
division between the semantemes shi and the morphemes ji of
Japanese by establishing formal distance between his verba and
particula reflects his consciousness that the morphological elements in
Japanese are of a different order than those in Latin At times such as
when he describes the preterit subjunctive as agueta raba his divisions
fly in the face of derivational history But he can claim a reasonable
justification for his decision by citing Rodriguez rule for the formation
of this form add raba to the preterit of the verb Arte 18v
Perhaps it is a prejudice founded upon familiarity with 9 contemporary
romanizations but I cannot help but consider this attempt to give greater
independence to the particles as an improvement in the representation of
the morphological system
In all other significant facets of the morphology Collado follows the
principles established by Rodriguez with the one exception that in the
overall systematization of the verbal formation and conjugation he follows
the classifications established in Lebrijas Introductiones rather than
those which Rodriguez inherited from the Institutiones of Alverez The
most significant difference between the two systems is the use by Lebrija
of the term subjunctive in his description of the moods where Rodriguez
gives independent status to the conjunctive conditional concessive and
potential As we shall see after presenting the conjugational system of
the verb within the framework of Lebrija Collado breaks the expected
sequence of his description of the verb to interject a section on
conditional constructions and another on those of the potential
In the treatment of the tenses Collado breaks with Rodriguez in not
attempting to establish an imperfect for Japanese but he does follow him
in the overall classification of the conjugations Thus9
1st Conjugation    verbs ending in e gi and     eg ague uru
ji xi and maraxi
2nd Conjugation    verbs ending in i                eg iomi u
3rd Conjugation    verbs ending in ai oi and    eg narai o
ui
To the description of this general system Collado adds the treatment of the
substantive verbs This section in many respects is the weakest in his
grammar with a portion of his description lost in composing the final text
Since Collado does not as Rodriguez present the conjugations in
paradigmatic form I have extracted from his presentation the most
representative forms of the verb ague uru for each of the categories of
the system and presented them in Chart 2 for reference

The Structure of Collados and Rodriguez Descriptions Contrasted
In every section of his description Collado is indebted to the material
presented by Rodriguez in his Arte da Lingoa de Iapam The structure of
the Ars Grammaticae however follows a much more simplistic design than
that of the Arte As a consequence Collado found it necessary to assemble
his data from various sections of Rodriguez description In the paragraphs
which follow we will briefly sketch the structural relation between these
two grammars
As he clearly states in his title to the main portion of the grammar
Collado bases his description on the Introductiones of Antonio Lebriya
and more specifically upon that portion of the great Latin grammar which
dealt with the parts of speech Further he limits himself to the spoken
language rather than attempting as does Rodriguez an integrated treatment
of both the spoken and written grammars
Under these influences Collados grammar takes on the following form
A Prologue including the phonology               35
The Body of the Grammar by parts of speech       661
A Brief Syntax                                    6166
A Treatment of the Arithmetic                     6674
A Note on the Written Language                    7475
In contrast Rodriguez Arte prepared under the influence of Alvarez
Institutiones develops its description over the span of three books
which treat both the spoken and written grammar in progressively greater
detail Thus
The Introduction                          iiiv
BOOK I
The Declensions                             12v
The Conjugations                           2v54
The Parts of Speech Rudimenta          5580v
BOOK II
The Syntax of the Parts of Speech          83168
Styles Pronunciation Poetics etc      168184
BOOK III
The Written Language                     184v206v

The Arithmetic                           212v239
12
Given these differing formats10 it is clear that Collado is unable to
cope adequately with the more complex aspects of the grammar specifically

book
An analysis of Collados description and a listing of the portions of
Rodriguez grammar from which material was taken yields the following

Two aspects of Japanese were not able to be described with any degree of
satisfaction by Collado the adjectives adjectiva and the prepositions
praepositio His difficulties attributable to the basic structural
difference between Latin and Japanese were compounded by the fact that
Rodriguez too was unable to find a satisfactory solution to their
description
With respect to the adjectives Collado attempts to deal with their
functions in the manner appropriate to Latin that is as a subclass of
13 nouns pp 911 He also recognizes their formal similarity to the
verb and treats them briefly as a subclass of the substantive verb pp
3233 but his heavy reliance upon the semantic categories of Latin does
not permit him to follow Rodriguez who is able more clearly to recognize
their formal as well as their functional distinctiveness
Concerning prepositions Collado was confronted with an all but
insurmountable taxonomic problem Here too Rodriguez was unable to develop
a completely satisfactory descriptive framework In the Arte the term
posposicao is used for those particles which function in a manner similar
to the Latin prepositions eg tameni taixite and tomoni cf
7373v and 140148v the term artigo is used for those particles having
the functions of the inflectional endings of Latin eg ga ye and
ni cf 12 78 and 137140 and the general term particula is used
to cover the broad spectrum of particles that include adverbs
conjunctions and exclamations as well as those otherwise unaccounted for
