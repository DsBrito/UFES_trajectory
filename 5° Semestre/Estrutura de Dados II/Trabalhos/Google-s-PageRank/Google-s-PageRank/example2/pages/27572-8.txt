The central shrine of a literary cult is at least as often its heros
home of adoption as his place of birth To the Wordsworthian
Cockermouth has but a faint remote interest in comparison with Grasmere
and Rydal Mount Edinburgh for all its associations with the life and
the genius of Scott is not as Abbotsford or as that beloved Border
country in which his memory has struck its deepest roots And so it is
with Dickens The accident of birth attaches his name but slightly to
Landport in Southsea The Dickens pilgrim treads in the most palpable
footsteps of Boz amongst the landmarks of a Victorian London too
rapidly disappearing and through the rich and varied landscape on
either side of the Medway covered with cornfields and pastures with
here and there a windmill or a distant church which Dickens loved from
boyhood peopled with the creatures of his teeming fancy and chose for
his last and mostcherished habitation
What Abbotsford was to Scott that almost to Dickens in his later
years was Gadshill Place From his study window in the grave redbrick
house on his little Kentish freeholda house which he had added to
and stuck bits upon in all manner of ways so that it was as pleasantly
irregular and as violently opposed to all architectural ideas as the
most hopeful man could possibly desirehe looked out so he wrote to a
friend on as pretty a view as you will find in a long days English
ride Cobham Park and Woods are behind the house the distant Thames
is in front the Medway with Rochester and its old castle and
cathedral on one side On every side he could not fail to reach in
those brisk walks with which he sought too strenuously perhaps health
and relaxation some object redolent of childish dreams or mature
achievement of intimate joys and sorrows of those phantoms of his
brain which to him then as to hundreds of thousands of his readers
since were not less real than the men and women of everyday encounter
On those seven miles between Rochester and Maidstone which he
discovered to be one of the most beautiful walks in England he might be
tempted to strike off at Aylesford for a short stroll to such a
pleasant old Elizabethan mansion as Cobtree Hall the very type it may
be of Manor Farm Dingley Dell or for a longer tramp to Town Malling
from which he may well have borrowed many strokes for the picture of
Muggleton that town of sturdy Kentish cricket Sometimes he would walk
across the marshes to Gravesend and returning through the village of
Chalk would pause for a retrospective glance at the house where his
honeymoon was spent and a good part of Pickwick planned In the latter
end of the year when he could take a short cut through the stubble
fields from Higham to the marshes lying further down the Thames he
would often visit the desolate churchyard where little Pip was so
terribly frightened by the convict Or descending the long slope from
Gadshill to Strood and crossing Rochester Bridgeover the balustrades
of which Mr Pickwick leaned in agreeable reverie when he was accosted
by Dismal Jemmythe author of Great Expectations and Edwin Drood
would pass from Rochester High Streetwhere Mr Pumblechooks seed shop
looks across the way at Miss Twinkletons establishmentinto the Vines
to compare once more the impression on his unerring inward eye with
the actual features of that Restoration House which under another name
he assigned to Miss Havisham and so round by Fort Pitt to the Chatham
lines And therewho can doubtif he seemed to hear the melancholy
wind that whistled through the deserted fields as Mr Winkle took his
reluctant stand a wretched and desperate duellist his thoughts would
also stray to the busy dockyard town and a blessed little room in a
plainlooking plasterfronted house from which dated all his early
readings and imaginings
Between the very small and notoverparticularlytakencareof boy and
the strong selfreliant man whose fame had filled two continents
Gadshill Place was an immediate link Everyone knows the story which
Dickens tells of a vision of his former self meeting him on the road to
Canterbury
So smooth was the old high road and so fresh were the horses and
so fast went I that it was midway between Gravesend and Rochester
and the widening river was bearing the ships whitesailed or
blacksmoked out to sea when I noticed by the wayside a very
queer small boy
Halloa said I to the very queer small boy where do you live
At Chatham says he
What do you do there say I
I go to school says he
I took him up in a moment and we went on Presently the very
queer small boy says This is Gadshill we are coming to where
Falstaff went out to rob those travellers and ran away
You know something about Falstaff eh said I
All about him said the very queer small boy I am old I am
nine and I read all sorts of books But do let us stop at the top
of the hill and look at the house there if you please
You admire that house said I
Illustration GADSHILL PLACE FROM THE GARDENS
Bless you sir said the very queer small boy when I was not
more than half as old as nine it used to be a treat for me to be
brought to look at it And now I am nine I come by myself to look
at it And ever since I can recollect my father seeing me so fond
of it has often said to me If you were to be very persevering
and were to work hard you might some day come to live in it
Though thats impossible said the very queer small boy drawing a
low breath and now staring at the house out of window with all his
might
I was rather amazed to be told this by the very queer small boy
for that house happens to be my house and I have reason to
believe that what he said was true
As the queer small boy in the Uncommercial Traveller said Gadshill
Place is at the very top of Falstaffs hill It stands on the south side
of the Dover roadon the north side but a little lower down is a
delightfully oldfashioned inn of the old coaching days the Sir John
Falstaffsurrounded by a high wall and screened by a row of limes
The front view with its wooden and pillared porch its bays its dormer
windows let into the roof and its surmounting bell turret and vane
bears much the same appearance as it did to the queer small boy But
amongst the many additions and alterations which Dickens was constantly
making the drawingroom had been enlarged from a smaller existing one
and the conservatory into which it opens was as he laughingly told his
younger daughter positively the last improvement at Gadshilla jest
to prove sadly prophetic for it was uttered on the Sunday before his
death The little library too on the opposite side of the porch from
the drawingroom and conservatory was a converted bedroom Its aspect
is familiar to most Dickenslovers from Sir Luke Fildess famous picture
of The Empty Chair In summer however Dickens used to do his work
not in the library but in a Swiss chalet presented to him by Fechter
the great actor which stood in a shrubbery lying on the other side of
the highroad and entered by a subway that Dickens had excavated for the
purpose The chalet now must be sought in the terrace garden of Cobham
Hall When Dickens sat at his desk in a room of the chalet up among
the branches of the trees the five mirrors which he had put in
reflected the leaves quivering at the windows and the great fields of
waving corn and the saildotted river The birds and butterflies flew
in and out the green branches shot in at the open windows and the
lights and shadows of the clouds and the scent of flowers and of
everything growing for miles had the same free access No imaginative
artist whether in words or colour could have desired a more inspiring
environment The back of the house looking southward descends by one
flight of steps upon a lawn where one of the balustrades of the old
Rochester Bridge had when this was demolished been fitted up as a
sundial The lawn in turn communicates with flower and vegetable
gardens by another flight of steps Beyond is the muchcoveted meadow
which Dickens obtained partly by exchange from the trusteesnot of
Wattss Charity as Forster has stated but of Sir Joseph Williamsons
Free School at Rochester It was in this field that the villagers from
neighbouring Higham played cricket matches and that just before
Dickens went to America for the last time he held those quaint
footraces for all and sundry described in one of his letters to
Forster Though the landlord of the Falstaff from over the way was
allowed to erect a drinking booth and all the prizes were given in
money though too the road from Chatham to Gadshill was like a fair
all day and the crowd consisted mainly of rough labouring men of
soldiers sailors and navvies there was no disorder not a flag rope
or stake displaced and no drunkenness whatever As striking a tribute
if rightly considered as ever was exacted by a strong and winning
personality One of those oddities in which Dickens delighted was
elicited by a hurdle race for strangers The man who came in second ran
120 yards and leaped over ten hurdles with a pipe in his mouth and
smoking it all the time If it hadnt been for your pipe said the
Master of Gadshill Place clapping him on the shoulder at the
winningpost you would have been first I beg your pardon sir he
answered but if it hadnt been for my pipe I should have been
nowhere
To the hospitable hearth of Gadshill Place were drawn by the fame of
the Inimitable Boz a long succession of brilliant men and women
mostly of the AngloSaxon race whether English or American and if not
in the throngs for which at Abbotsford open house was kept yet with a
frequency which would have made literary work almost impossible for the
host without remarkable steadiness of purpose and regularity of habits
For Longfellow and his daughters he turned out that they might see
all of the surrounding country which could be seen in a short stay a
couple of postilions in the old red jackets of the old red royal Dover
road and it was like a holiday ride in England fifty years ago
In his study in the late and early months and his Swiss chalet through
the summer Dickens would write such novels as Great Expectations and
the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood taking his local colour from
spots which lay within the compass of a reasonable walk and others
such as A Tale of Two Cities and Our Mutual Friend to which the
circumstances of time and place furnished little or nothing except their
influence on his mood Some of the occasional papers which in the
character of The Uncommercial Traveller he furnished to All the
Year Round have as much of the genius loci as any of his romances
Even today the rushing swarm of motor cars has not yet driven from the
more secluded nooks of Kent all such idylls of openair vagabondage as
this
I have my eyes upon a piece of Kentish road bordered on either
side by a wood and having on one hand between the road dust and
the trees a skirting patch of grass Wild flowers grow in
abundance on this spot and it lies high and airy with a distant
river stealing steadily away to the ocean like a mans life To
gain the milestone here which the moss primroses violets
bluebells and wild roses would soon render illegible but for
peering travellers pushing them aside with their sticks you must
come up a steep hill come which way you may So all the tramps
with carts or caravansthe gipsy tramp the show tramp the Cheap
Jackfind it impossible to resist the temptations of the place
and all turn the horse loose when they come to it and boil the
pot Bless the place I love the ashes of the vagabond fires that
have scorched its grass
The Kentish road that Dickens thus describes is certainly the Dover Road
at Gadshill from which of course there is a steep declivity whether
the route is westward to Gravesend or eastwards to Strood and Rochester
In Strood itself Dickens found little to interest him though the view
of Rochester from Strood Hill is an arresting one with the stately
medivalism of Castle and Cathedral emerging from a kind of haze in
which it is hard to distinguish what is smokewreath and what a mass of
crowding roofs The Medway which divides Strood from the almost
indistinguishably overlapping towns of Rochester Chatham and
Brompton is crossed by an iron bridge superseding the old stone
structure commemorated in Pickwick Mr Pickwicks notes on the four
towns do not require very much modification to apply to their present
state
The principal productions he wrote appear to be soldiers
sailors Jews chalk shrimps officers and dockyard men The
commodities chiefly exposed for sale in the public streets are
marine stores hardbake apples flatfish and oysters The
streets present a lively and animated appearance occasioned
chiefly by the conviviality of the military The consumption of
tobacco in these towns must be very great and the smell which
pervades the streets must be exceedingly delicious to those who are
extremely fond of smoking A superficial traveller might object to
the dirt which is their leading characteristic but to those who
view it as an indication of traffic and commercial prosperity it
is truly gratifying
Illustration ROCHESTER FROM STROOD
This description is much less true of Rochester than of its three
neighbours and does no justice to the aspects which Dickens himself
presented in the Market Town of Great Expectations and the
Cloisterham of Edwin Drood Amid the rather sordid encroachments of a
modern industrialism Rochester still keeps something of the air of an
oldworld country town and in the precincts of its Cathedral there
still broods a cloistral peace The dominating feature of the town from
whatever side approached is the massive ruin of the Norman Keep of
Bishop Gundulf the architect also of Londons White Tower Though
the blue sky is its only roof and on the rugged staircase the dark
apertures in the walls where rafters and floors were once show like
gaping sockets from which the ravens and daws have picked out the eyes
it seems to stand with all the immovable strength of some solid rock on
which the waves of rebellion or invasion would have dashed and broken
It is easy to believe the saying of Lambarde in his Perambulation of
Kent that from time to time it had a part in almost every tragedie
But the grimness of its grey walls is relieved by a green mantle of
clinging ivy and though it can no longer be said of the Castle that it
is bathed though in ruins with a flush of flowers the beautiful
single pink grows wild on its ramparts
From the Castle to the Bull in the High Street is a transition which
seems almost an anachronism It is but to follow in the traces of the
Pickwick Club The covered gateway the staircase almost wide enough for
a coach and four the ballroom on the first floor landing with
cardroom adjoining and the bedroom which Mr Winkle occupied inside
Mr Tupmansall are there just as when the club entertained Alfred
Jingle to a dinner of soles a broiled fowl and mushrooms and Mr
Tupman took him to the ball in Mr Winkles coat borrowed without
leave and Dr Slammer of the 97th sent his challenge next morning to
the owner of the coat The Guildhall with its gilt ship for a vane and
its old brick front supported by Doric stone columns is not so
memorable because Hogarth played hopscotch in the colonnade during his
Five Days Peregrination by Land and Water as for the day when
Pumblechook bundled Pip off to be bound apprentice to Jo before the
Justices in the Hall a queer place with higher pews in it than a
church  and with some shining black portraits on the walls This was
the Town Hall too which Dickens has told us that he had set up in his
childish mind as the model on which the genie of the lamp built the
palace for Aladdin only to return and recognize with saddened
grownup eyesexaggerating the depreciation a little for the sake of
the contrasta mere mean little heap of bricks like a chapel gone
demented Close by the Guildhall is the Town Clock supposed to be the
finest clock in the world which alas turned out to be as moonfaced
and weak a clock as a mans eyes ever saw
On the north side of the High Street not many yards from the Bull is a
Tudor twostoried stonebuilt house with latticed windows and gables
This is the Charity founded by the will of Richard Watts in 1579 to
give lodging and entertainment for one night and fourpence each to
six poor travellers not being rogues or proctors It furnished the
theme to the Christmas cycle of stories The Seven Poor Travellers
the narrator who treats the waifs and strays harboured one Christmas
eve at the Charity to roast turkey plum pudding and wassail
bringing up the number to seven being as he says a traveller
myself though an idle one and being withal as poor as I hope to be
Farther up the High Street towards Chatham about a quarter of a mile
from Rochester Bridge are two sixteenthcentury houses with fronts of
carved oak and gables facing each other across the street One has
figured in both Great Expectations and Edwin Drood for it is the
house of Mr Pumblechook the pompous and egregious corn and seedsman
and of Mr Sapsea the auctioneer still more pompous and egregious The
otherEastgate House now converted into a museumis the Nuns
House where Miss Twinkleton kept school and had Rosa Bud and Helen
Landless for pupils
From the hum and traffic of the cheerfully frequented High Street to the
calm and hush of the Cathedral precincts entrance is given by Chertseys
or College Yard Gate which abuts on the High Street about a hundred
yards north of the Cathedral It was this Gate which Sir Luke Fildes
sketched as he has recorded in an interesting letter published in A
Weeks Tramp in DickensLand by W R Hughes for the background of
his drawing of Durdles Cautioning Sapsea There are however two
other gatehouses the Priors a tower over an archway containing a
single room approached by a postern stair and Deanery Gate a
quaint old house adjoining the Cathedral which has ten rooms some of
them beautifully panelled Its drawingroom on the upper floor bears a
strong resemblance to the roomas depicted by Sir Luke Fildesin which
Jasper entertained his nephew and Neville Landless but the artist
believes that he never saw the interior It is not unlikely that Dickens
took some details from each of the gatehouses to make a composite
picture of Mr Jaspers own gatehouse which seemed so to stem the
tide of life that while the murmur of the tide was heard beyond not a
wave would pass the archway
Rochester Cathedral which overshadows though in a less insistent and
tragic manner the whole human interest of Edwin Drood almost as much
as Notre Dame overshadows the human interest in Victor Hugos romance
preserves some remains of the original Saxon and Norman churches on the
site of which it was erected Its Early English and Decorated Gothic
came off lightly from three restorations but the tower is
nineteenthcentury vandalism The Norman west front enshrines in the
riches of its sculptured portal with its five receding arches figures
of the Saviour and his twelve apostles and on two shafts are carved
likenesses of Henry I and his Queen Freeman has pronounced it to be far
the finest example of Norman architecture of its kind The Chapter House
door a magnificent example of Decorated Gothic is adorned with
effigies representing the Christian and Jewish Churches which are
surrounded by Holy Fathers and Angels who pray for the soul
emblematically represented as a small nude form above them But it is
about the stonevaulted crypt where even by daylight the heavy pillars
which support the roof engender masses of black shade with lanes of
light between and about the winding staircase and belfry of the great
tower that the spells of the Dickens magic especially cling and Jasper
and Durdles revisit these haunts by the glimpses of the moon as
persistently as Quasimodo and the sinister Priest beset with their
ghostly presences the belfry of the great Paris minster
Of the historic imagination Dickens had little or none He could not
evoke and never had the faintest desire to evoke a Past that was
divided from the Present by an unbridgeable chasm Thus Rochester
Castle though he seldom failed to bring his guests to view it
affected him only with a remote sense of antiquity such as he would have
experienced no more and no less amongst the Pyramids But he was
keenly sensitive to the influences of a Past which still survived and
by the continuity of a corporate life made an integral part in the
Present The Cathedral life in which by virtue of their office canons
and dean were living relics of antiquity and as much the contemporaries
as the successors of the ecclesiastics who lay crumbling in the crypt
stirred this sense in him as it had been stirred by the ancient Inns of
London Almost the last words that he wrote were a tribute to the beauty
of the venerable fane in which beneath the monument of the founder of
that quaint Charity rendered so famous by his story of The Seven Poor
Travellers a simple brass records his birth death and burialplace
To connect his memory with the scenes in which his earliest and his
latest years were passed and with the associations of Rochester
Cathedral and its neighbourhood which extended over all his life
Illustration RESTORATION HOUSE ROCHESTER
In the old cemetery of St Nicholas Church on the north side of the
Cathedral it was Dickenss desire to be buried and his family would
have carried out his wishes had it not been that the burialground had
been closed for years and no further interments were allowed On the
south side of the Cathedral is the delightfully oldfashioned terrace
known as Minor Canon RowDickenss name for it is Minor Canon
Cornerwhere the Reverend Septimus Crisparkle kept house with the
china shepherdess mother The Monks Vineyard of Edwin Drood
exists as The Vines Here under a group of elms called The Seven
Sisters Edwin Drood and Rosa sat when they decided to break their
engagement and opposite The Seven Sisters is the Satis House of
Great Expectations where the lonely and embittered Miss Havisham
taught Estella the cruel lessons of a ruined life It is really
Restoration HouseSatis House is on the site of the mansion of Master
Richard Watts to whose apologies for no better entertainment of his
Sovereign Queen Elizabeth answered Satisand it takes its name from
having received the restored Merry Monarch under its roof on his way to
London and the throne Pepys who was terrified by the steepness of the
castle cliff and had no time to stay to service at the Cathedral when
he had been inspecting the defences at Chatham found something more to
his mind in a stroll by Restoration House and into the Cherry Garden
where he met a silly shopkeeper with a pretty wife and did kiss her
Dickens would often follow this route of Pepys but in the reverse
direction that is through the Vines to Chatham and its lines of
fortification where Mr Pickwick Mr Winkle and Mr Snodgrass became
so hopelessly entangled in the sham fight which they had gone over from
Rochester to see At No 11 Ordnance Terrace the little Charles Dickens
lived from 1817 to 1821 and at No 18 St Marys Place from 1821 to
1823 the financial troubles which eventually drove the family into the
Marshalsea debtors prison and Charles himself into the sordid drudgery
of the blackingshop by Hungerford Stairs having already enforced a
migration to a cheaper and meaner house In Clover Street then Clover
Lane the little Dickens went to a school kept by a Mr William Giles
who years afterwards sent to him when he was halfway through with
Pickwick a silver snuffbox inscribed to the Inimitable Boz To the
Mitre Inn in the Chatham High Street where Nelson had many times put
up Dickens was often brought by his father to recite or sing standing
on a table for the amusement of parties of friends He speaks of it in
the Holly Tree Inn as
The inn where friends used to put up and where we used to go to
see parents and to have salmon and fowls and be tipped It had an
ecclesiastical signthe mitreand a bar that seemed to be the
next best thing to a bishopric it was so snug I loved the
landlords youngest daughter to distractionbut let that pass It
was in this inn that I was cried over by my little rosy sister
because I had acquired a black eye in a fight
When the little Charles Dickens was taken away to London inside the
stagecoach Commodorehis kind master on the night before having come
flitting in among the packingcases to give him Goldsmiths Bee as a
keepsakehe was leaving behind for ever in the playingfield near
Clover Lane and the grounds of Rochester Castle and the green drives of
Cobham Park the untroubled dreams of happy childhood And though he
could not know this yet as he sat amongst the damp straw piled up
round him in the inside of the coach he consumed his sandwiches in
solitude and dreariness and thought life sloppier than he had expected
to find it And in David Copperfield he has thrown back into those
earlier golden days the shadow of his London privations by bringing the
little Copperfield footsore and tired toiling towards dusk into
Chatham which in that nights aspect is a mere dream of chalk and
drawbridges and mastless ships in a muddy river roofed like Noahs
arks No doubt the terrible old Jew in the marinestores shop who
rated and frightened David with his Oh my eyes and limbs what do you
want Oh my lungs and liver what do you want Ohgoroo
goroountil the helpless little fellow was obliged to close with an
offer of a few pence instead of half a crown for his waistcoat is the
portrait of some actual Jew dealer whom in one of the back streets of
Chatham the keen eyes of the precocious child seeming to look at
nothing had curiously watched hovering like a hideous spider on the
pounce behind his grimeencrusted window
It was old associations that led Dickens so often in his walks from
Gadshill Place to Chatham But the neighbourhood which gave him most
pleasure combining as it did with similar associations an exquisite
beauty was Forster tells us the sylvan scenery of Cobham Park The
green woods and green shades of Cobham would recur to his memory even in
faroff Lausanne and the last walk that he ever enjoyedon the day
before his fatal seizurewas through these woods the charm of which
cannot be better defined than in his own description in Pickwick
A delightful walk it was for it was a pleasant afternoon in June
and their way lay through a deep and shady wood cooled by the
light wind which gently rustled the thick foliage and enlivened by
the songs of the birds that perched upon the boughs The ivy and
the moss crept in thick clusters over the old trees and the soft
green turf overspread the ground like a silken mat They emerged
upon an open park with an ancient hall displaying the quaint and
picturesque architecture of Elizabeths time Long vistas of
stately oaks and elm trees appeared on every side large herds of
deer were cropping the fresh grass and occasionally a startled
hare scoured along the ground with the speed of the shadows thrown
by the light clouds which swept across a sunny landscape like a
passing breath of summer
The mission on which Mr Pickwick and his two disciples were engaged
was it will be remembered to convert Mr Tupman from his resolution
to forsake the world in a fit of misanthropy induced by the
faithlessness of Rachel Wardle
If this said Mr Pickwick looking about himIf this were the
place to which all who are troubled with our friends complaint
came I fancy their old attachment to this world would very soon
return
Mr Pickwick was right for when they arrived at the village and
entered that clean and commodious village alehouse the Leather
Bottle they found Mr Tupman set down at a table well covered with a
roast fowl bacon ale and et ceteras and looking as unlike a man
who had taken leave of the world as possible
The ancient hall of Cobham consists of two Tudor wings with a central
block designed by Inigo Jones It has a splendid collection of Old
Masters and a music room which the Prince Regent pronounced to be the
finest room in England In the terrace flower garden at the back of the
Hall it may be mentioned again here is the Swiss chalet from Gadshill
Place which served Dickens for a study in the summer months The
circuit of Cobham Park is about seven miles and it is crossed by the
Long Avenue leading to Rochester and the Grand Avenue which
sloping down from the tenantless Mausoleum opens into Cobham village
The inn to which Mr Tupman retired in disgust with life still
retains the title of the Leather Bottle but has mounted for its sign
a coloured portrait of Mr Pickwick addressing the Club in
characteristic attitude It was in Cobham village that Mr Pickwick made
his notable discovery of the stone with the mysterious inscriptionan
inscription which the envious Blotton maintained was nothing more than
BIL STUMPS HIS MARK Local tradition suggests that Dickens intended the
episode for a skit upon archaeological theories about the dolmens known
as Kits Coty House and that a Strood antiquary keenly resented the
satire However that may be Kits Coty House is not at Cobham but some
miles away near Aylesford In Cobham church there is perhaps the finest
and most complete series of monumental brasses in this country most of
them commemorating the Lords of Cobham
Illustration COBHAM PARK
Out of the Cobham woods it is not a long walk to the little village of
Shorne where Dickens was fond of sitting on a hot summer afternoon in
its pretty shaded churchyard This is believed to be the spot which he
has described in Pickwick as one of the most peaceful and secluded
churchyards in Kent where wild flowers mingle with the grass and the
soft landscape around forms the fairest spot in the garden of England
A picturesque lane leads into the road from Rochester to Gravesend on
the outskirts of the village of Chalk Here in a corner house on the
south side of the road Dickens spent his honeymoon and many of the
earlier chapters of Pickwick were written In February of the
following year1837Dickens and his wife returned to the same
lodgings shortly after the birth of his eldest son Chalk church is
about a mile from the village There was formerly above the porch the
figure of an old priest in a stooping attitude holding an upturned jug
Dickens took a strange interest in this quaint carving and it is said
that whenever he passed it he took off his hat or gave it a nod as to
an old acquaintance
Very different to the soft and genial landscapes about Cobham is the
grey and desolate aspect of another haunt which Dickens loved to
frequent This was the meshes around Cooling In winter when it was
possible to make a short cut across the stubble fields he would visit
Cooling churchyard not less seldom than in summer he would go to sit in
the churchyard of Shorne First however he would have to pass through
the village of Higham where too was his nearest railway station
though he often preferred to walk over and entrain at Gravesend or
Greenhithe But the pleasant tinkle of harness bells was a familiar
sound in the night to the Higham villagers as the carriage was sent
down from Gadshill Place to meet the master or his friends returning
from London by the ten oclock train Dickens took a kindly and active
