of Christ sent you to that poor man  May that love ever dwell richly
in you by faith  May it constrain you to seek the wandering souls of
men with the fervent desire to spend and be spent for his glory  May
the unction of the Holy Spirit attend the word spoken by you with
power and convey deep conviction to the hearts of your hearers  May
many of them experience the Divine change of being made new creatures
in Christ
Sir be fervent in prayer with God for the conviction and conversion
of sinners  His power is great and who can withstand it  He has
promised to answer the prayer of faith that is put up in his Sons
name Ask what ye will it shall be granted you  How this should
strengthen our faith when we are taught by the Word and the Spirit
how to pray  O that sweet inspiring hope how it lifts up the
fainting spirits when we look over the precious promises of God  What
a mercy if we know Christ and the power of his resurrection in our
own hearts  Through faith in Christ we rejoice in hope and look in
expectation of that time drawing near when all shall know and fear
the Lord and when a nation shall be born in a day
What a happy time when Christs kingdom shall come then shall his
will be done in earth as it is in heaven  Men shall be daily fed
with the manna of his love and delight themselves in the Lord all the
day long  Then what a paradise below they will enjoy  How it
animates and enlivens my soul with vigour to pursue the ways of God
that I may even now bear some humble part in giving glory to God and
the Lamb
Sir I began to write this on Sunday being detained from attending
on public worship  My dear and only sister living as a servant with
Mrs  was so ill that I came here to attend in her place and on
her  But now she is no more
I was going to intreat you to write to her in answer to this she
being convinced of the evil of her past life and that she had not
walked in the ways of God nor sought to please Him  But she
earnestly desired to do so  This makes me have a comfortable hope
that she is gone to glory and that she is now joining in sweet
concert with the angelic host in heaven to sing the wonders of
redeeming love  I hope I may now write Blessed are the dead which
die in the Lord
She expressed a desire to receive the Lords Supper and commemorate
his precious death and sufferings  I told her as well as I was able
what it was to receive Christ into her heart but as her weakness of
body increased she did not mention it again  She seemed quite
resigned before she died  I do hope she is gone from a world of death
and sin to be with God for ever
Sir I hope you will not be offended with me a poor ignorant person
to take such a liberty as to write to you  But I trust as you are
called to instruct sinners in the ways of God you will bear with me
and be so kind to answer this wrote letter and give me some
instructions  It is my hearts desire to have the mind that was in
Christ that when I awake up in his likeness then I may be satisfied
My sister expressed a wish that you might bury her  The minister of
our parish whither she will be carried cannot come  She will lie at
She died on Tuesday morning and will be buried on Friday or
Saturday whichever is most convenient to you at three oclock in
the afternoon  Please to send an answer by the bearer to let me know
whether you can comply with this request
From your unworthy servant
ELIZABETH W
I was much struck with the simple and earnest strain of devotion which
this letter breathed  It was but indifferently written and spelt but
this rather tended to endear the hitherto unknown writer as it seemed
characteristic of the union of humbleness of station with eminence of
piety  I felt quite thankful that I was favoured with a correspondent of
this description the more so as such characters were at this time very
rare in the neighbourhood  I have often wished that epistolary
intercourse of this kind was more encouraged and practised among us  I
have the greatest reason to speak well of its effect both on myself and
others  Communication by letter as well as by conversation with the
pious poor has often been the instrument of animating and reviving my
own heart in the midst of duty and of giving me the most profitable
information for the general conduct of the ministerial office
As soon as the letter was read I inquired who was the bearer of it
He is waiting at the outside of the gate sir was the reply
I went out to speak to him and saw a venerable old man whose long hoary
hair and deeplywrinkled countenance commanded more than common respect
He was resting his arm upon the gate and tears were streaming down his
cheeks  On my approach he made a low bow and said
Sir I have brought you a letter from my daughter but I fear you will
think us very bold in asking you to take so much trouble
By no means I replied I shall be truly glad to oblige you and any of
your family in this matter provided it be quite agreeable to the
minister of your parish
Sir he told me yesterday that he should be very glad if I could procure
some gentleman to come and bury my poor child for him as he lives five
miles off and has particular business on that day  So when I told my
daughter she asked me to come to you sir and bring that letter which
would explain the matter
I desired him to come into the house and then said
What is your occupation
Sir I have lived most of my days in a little cottage at  six miles
from here  I have rented a few acres of ground and kept some cows
which in addition to my daylabour has been the means of supporting and
bringing up my family
What family have you
A wife now getting very aged and helpless two sons and one daughter
for my other poor dear child is just departed out of this wicked world
I hope for a better
I hope so too poor thing  She did not use to take to such good ways
as her sister but I do believe that her sisters manner of talking with
her before she died was the means of saving her soul  What a mercy it
is to have such a child as mine is  I never thought about my own soul
seriously till she poor girl begged and prayed me to flee from the
wrath to come
How old are you
Near seventy and my wife is older we are getting old and almost past
our labour but our daughter has left a good place where she lived in
service on purpose to come home and take care of us and our little
dairy  And a dear dutiful affectionate girl she is
Was she always so
No sir when she was very young she was all for the world and
pleasure and dress and company  Indeed we were all very ignorant and
thought if we took care for this life and wronged nobody we should be
sure to go to heaven at last  My daughters were both wilful and like
ourselves strangers to the ways of God and the Word of his grace  But
the eldest of them went out to service and some years ago she heard a
sermon at  Church by a gentleman that was going to  as chaplain
to the colony and from that time she seemed quite another creature  She
began to read the Bible and became sober and steady  The first time she
returned home afterwards to see us she brought us a guinea which she had
saved from her wages and said as we were getting old she was sure we
should want help adding that she did not wish to spend it in fine
clothes as she used to do only to feed pride and vanity  She said she
would rather show gratitude to her dear father and mother because Christ
had shown such mercy to her
We wondered to hear her talk and took great delight in her company for
her temper and behaviour were so humble and kind she seemed so desirous
to do us good both in soul and body and was so different from what we
had ever seen before that careless and ignorant as we had been we
began to think there must be something real in religion or it never
could alter a person so much in a little time
Her youngest sister poor soul used to laugh and ridicule her at that
time and said her head was turned with her new ways  No sister she
would say not my head but I hope my heart is turned from the love
of sin to the love of God  I wish you may one day see as I do the
danger and vanity of your present condition
Her poor sister would reply I do not want to hear any of your
preaching I am no worse than other people and that is enough for me
Well sister Elizabeth would say if you will not hear me you
cannot hinder me from praying for you which I do with all my heart
And now sir I believe those prayers are answered  For when her sister
was taken ill Elizabeth went to Mrs s to wait in her place and take
care of her  She said a great deal to her about her soul and the poor
girl began to be so deeply affected and sensible of her past sin and so
thankful for her sisters kind behaviour that it gave her great hopes
indeed for her sake  When my wife and I went to see her as she lay
sick she told us how grieved and ashamed she was of her past life but
said she had a hope through grace that her sisters Saviour would be her
Saviour too for she saw her own sinfulness felt her own helplessness
and only wished to cast herself upon Christ as her hope and salvation
And now sir she is gone and I hope and think her sisters prayers for
her conversion to God have been answered  The Lord grant the same for
her poor father and mothers sake likewise
This conversation was a very pleasing commentary upon the letter which I
had received and made me anxious both to comply with the request and to
become acquainted with the writer  I promised the good Dairyman to
attend on the Friday at the appointed hour and after some more
conversation respecting his own state of mind under the present trial he
went away
He was a reverend old man his furrowed cheeks white locks weeping
eyes bent shoulders and feeble gait were characteristic of the aged
pilgrim  As he slowly walked onwards supported by a stick which seemed
to have been the companion of many a long year a train of reflections
occurred which I retrace with pleasure and emotion
At the appointed hour I arrived at the church and after a little while
was summoned to the churchyard gate to meet the funeral procession  The
aged parents the elder brother and the sister with other relatives
formed an affecting group  I was struck with the humble pious and
pleasing countenance of the young woman from whom I had received the
letter  It bore the marks of great seriousness without affectation and
of much serenity mingled with a glow of devotion
A circumstance occurred during the reading of the burial service which I
think it right to mention as one among many testimonies of the solemn
and impressive tendency of our truly evangelical Liturgy
A man of the village who had hitherto been of a very careless and even
profligate character went into the church through mere curiosity and
with no better purpose than that of vacantly gazing at the ceremony  He
came likewise to the grave and during the reading of those prayers
which are appointed for that part of the service his mind received a
deep serious conviction of his sin and spiritual danger  It was an
impression that never wore off but gradually ripened into the most
satisfactory evidence of an entire change of which I had many and long
continued proofs  He always referred to the burial service and to some
particular sentences of it as the clearly ascertained instrument of
bringing him through grace to the knowledge of the truth
The day was therefore one to be remembered  Remembered let it be by
those who love to hear
The short and simple annals of the poor
Was there not a manifest and happy connection between the circumstances
that providentially brought the serious and the careless to the same
grave on that day together  How much do they lose who neglect to trace
the leadings of God in providence as links in the chain of his eternal
purpose of redemption and grace
While infidels may scoff let us adore
After the service was concluded I had a short conversation with the good
old couple and their daughter  She had told me that she intended to
remain a week or two at the gentlemans house where her sister died till
another servant should arrive and take her sisters place
I shall be truly obliged said she by an opportunity of conversing
with you either there or at my fathers when I return home which will
be in the course of a fortnight at the farthest  I shall be glad to talk
to you about my sister whom you have just buried
Her aspect and address were highly interesting  I promised to see her
very soon and then returned home quietly reflecting on the
circumstances of the funeral at which I had been engaged  I blessed the
God of the poor and prayed that the poor might become rich in faith and
the rich be made poor in spirit
CHAPTER II
A sweet solemnity often possesses the mind whilst retracing past
intercourse with departed friends  How much is this increased when they
were such as lived and died in the Lord  The remembrance of former
scenes and conversations with those who we believe are now enjoying the
uninterrupted happiness of a better world fills the heart with pleasing
sadness and animates the soul with the hopeful anticipation of a day
when the glory of the Lord shall be revealed in the assembling of all his
children together never more to be separated  Whether they were rich or
poor while on earth is a matter of trifling consequence the valuable
part of their character is that they are kings and priests unto God and
this is their true nobility  In the number of now departed believers
with whom I once loved to converse on the grace and glory of the kingdom
of God was the Dairymans daughter
About a week after the funeral I went to visit the family at  in
whose service the youngest sister had lived and died and where Elizabeth
was requested to remain for a short time in her stead
The house was a large and venerable mansion  It stood in a beautiful
valley at the foot of a high hill  It was embowered in fine woods which
were interspersed in every direction with rising falling and swelling
grounds  The manorhouse had evidently descended through a long line of
ancestry from a distant period of time  The Gothic character of its
original architecture was still preserved in the latticed windows
adorned with carved divisions and pillars of stonework  Several pointed
terminations also in the construction of the roof according to the
custom of our forefathers fully corresponded with the general features
of the building
One end of the house was entirely clothed with the thick foliage of an
immense ivy which climbed beyond customary limits and embraced a lofty
chimney up to its very summit  Such a tree seemed congenial to the walls
that supported it and conspired with the antique fashion of the place to
carry imagination back to the days of our ancestors
As I approached I was led to reflect on the lapse of ages and the
successive generations of men each in their turn occupying lands
houses and domains each in their turn also disappearing and leaving
their inheritance to be enjoyed by others  David once observed the same
and cried out Behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and
mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is
altogether vanity  Surely every man walketh in a vain show surely they
are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall
gather them Psal xxxix 5 6
Happy would it be for the rich if they more frequently meditated on the
uncertainty of all their possessions and the frail nature of every
earthly tenure  Their inward thought is that their houses shall
continue for ever and their dwellingplaces to all generations they
call their lands after their own names  Nevertheless man being in
honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perish  This their way is
their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings  Like sheep they
are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and their beauty shall
consume in the grave from their dwelling Psal xlix 1114
As I advanced to the mansion a pleasing kind of gloom overspread the
front it was occasioned by the shade of trees and gave a characteristic
effect to the ancient fabric  I instantly recollected that death had
very recently visited the house and that one of its present inhabitants
was an affectionate mourner for a departed sister
There is a solemnity in the thought of a recent death which will
associate itself with the very walls from whence we are conscious that a
soul has just taken its flight to eternity
After passing some time in conversation with the superiors of the family
in the course of which I was much gratified by hearing of the unremitted
attention which the elder sister had paid to the younger during the
illness of the latter  I received likewise other testimonies of the
excellency of her general character and conduct in the house  I then
took leave requesting permission to see her agreeably to the promise I
had made at the funeral not many days before
I was shown into a parlour where I found her alone  She was in deep
mourning  She had a calmness and serenity in her countenance which
exceedingly struck me and impressed some idea of those attainments which
a further acquaintance with her afterwards so much increased
She spoke of her sister  I had the satisfaction of finding that she had
given very hopeful proofs of a change of heart before she died  The
prayers and earnest exhortations of Elizabeth had been blessed to a happy
effect  She described what had passed with such a mixture of sisterly
affection and pious dependence on the mercy of God to sinners as
convinced me that her own heart was under the influence of pure and
undefiled religion
She requested leave occasionally to correspond with me on serious
subjects stating that she needed much instruction  She hoped I would
pardon the liberty which she had taken by introducing herself to my
notice  She expressed a trust that the Lord would overrule both the
death of her sister and the personal acquaintance with me that resulted
from it to a present and future good as it respected herself and also
her parents with whom she statedly lived and to whom she expected to
return in a few days
Finding that she was wanted in some household duty I did not remain long
with her but left her with an assurance that I proposed to visit her
parents very shortly
Sir said she I take it very kind that you have condescended to leave
the company of the rich and converse with the poor  I wish I could have
said more to you respecting my own state of mind  Perhaps I shall be
better able another time  When you next visit me instead of finding me
in these noble walls you will see me in a poor cottage  But I am
happiest when there  Once more sir I thank you for your past kindness
to me and mine and may God in many ways bless you for it
I quitted the house with no small degree of satisfaction in consequence
of the new acquaintance which I had formed  I discovered traces of a
cultivated as well as a spiritual mind  I felt that religious
intercourse with those of low estate may be rendered eminently useful to
others whose outward station and advantages are far above their own
How often does it appear that God hath chosen the weak things of the
world to confound the things which are mighty and base things of the
world and things which are despised hath God chosen yea and things
which are not to bring to nought things that are that no flesh should
glory in his presence 1 Cor i 2729
It was not unfrequently my custom when my mind was filled with any
interesting subject for meditation to seek some spot where the beauties
of natural prospect might help to form pleasing and useful associations
I therefore ascended gradually to the very summit of the hill adjoining
the mansion where my visit had just been made  Here was placed an
elevated sea mark it was in the form of a triangular pyramid and built
of stone  I sat down on the ground near it and looked at the
surrounding prospect which was distinguished for beauty and
magnificence  It was a lofty station which commanded a complete circle
of interesting objects to engage the spectators attention
Southward the view was terminated by a long range of hills at about six
miles distance  They met to the westward another chain of hills of
which the one whereon I sat formed a link and the whole together nearly
encompassed a rich and fruitful valley filled with cornfields and
pastures  Through this vale winded a small river for many miles much
cattle were feeding on its banks  Here and there lesser eminences arose
in the valley some covered with wood others with corn or grass and a
few with heath or fern  One of these little hills was distinguished by a
parish church at the top presenting a striking feature in the landscape
Another of these elevations situated in the centre of the valley was
adorned with a venerable holly tree which had grown there for ages  Its
singular height and widespreading dimensions not only render it an
object of curiosity to the traveller but of daily usefulness to the
pilot as a mark visible from the sea whereby to direct his vessel safe
into harbour  Villages churches countryseats farmhouses and
cottages were scattered over every part of the southern valley  In this
direction also at the foot of the hill where I was stationed appeared
the ancient mansion which I had just quitted embellished with its
woods groves and gardens
Southeastward I saw the open ocean bounded only by the horizon  The
sun shone and gilded the waves with a glittering light that sparkled in
the most brilliant manner  More to the east in continuation of that
line of hills where I was placed rose two downs one beyond the other
both covered with sheep and the sea just visible over the farthest of
them as a terminating boundary  In this point ships were seen some
sailing others at anchor  Here the little river which watered the
southern valley finished its course and ran through meadows into the
sea in an eastward direction
On the north the sea appeared like a noble river varying from three to
seven miles in breadth between the banks of the opposite coast and those
of the island which I inhabited  Immediately underneath me was a fine
woody district of country diversified by many pleasing objects  Distant
towns were visible on the opposite shore  Numbers of ships occupied the
sheltered station which this northern channel afforded them  The eye
roamed with delight over an expanse of near and remote beauties which
alternately caught the observation and which harmonised together and
produced a scene of peculiar interest
Westward the hills followed each other forming several intermediate and
partial valleys in a kind of undulations like the waves of the sea
and bending to the south completed the boundary of the larger valley
before described to the southward of the hill on which I sat  In many
instances the hills were cultivated with corn to their very summits and
seemed to defy the inclemency of weather which at these heights
usually renders the ground incapable of bringing forth and ripening the
crops of grain  One hill alone the highest in elevation and about ten
miles to the southwestward was enveloped in a cloud which just
permitted a dim and hazy sight of a signalpost a lighthouse and an
ancient chantry built on its summit
Amidst these numerous specimens of delightful scenery I found a mount for
contemplation and here I indulged it
How much of the natural beauties of Paradise still remain in the world
although its spiritual character has been so awfully defaced by sin  But
when Divine grace renews the heart of the fallen sinner Paradise is
regained and much of its beauty restored to the soul  As this prospect
is compounded of hill and dale land and sea woods and plains all
sweetly blended together and relieving each other in the landscape so do
the gracious dispositions wrought in the soul produce a beauty and
harmony of scene to which it was before a stranger
I looked towards the village in the plain below where the Dairymans
younger daughter was buried  I retraced the simple solemnities of the
funeral  I connected the principles and conduct of her sister with the
present probably happy state of her soul in the world of spirits and was
greatly impressed with a sense of the importance of family influence as a
means of grace  That young woman I thought has been the conductor
of not only a sister but perhaps a father and mother also to the true
knowledge of God and may by Divine blessing become so to others  It
is a glorious occupation to win souls to Christ and guide them out of
Egyptian bondage through the wilderness into the promised Canaan  Happy
are the families who are walking hand in hand together as pilgrims
towards the heavenly country  May the number of such be daily
increasing
Casting my eye over the numerous dwellings in the vales on the right and
left I could not help thinking How many of their inhabitants are
ignorant of the ways of God and strangers to his grace  May this
thought stimulate to activity and diligence in the cause of immortal
souls  They are precious in Gods sightthey ought to be so in ours
Some pointed and affecting observations to that effect recurred to my
mind as having been made by the young person with whom I had been just
conversing  Her mind appeared to be much impressed with the duty of
speaking and acting for God while it is day conscious that the night
cometh when no man can work
Her laudable anxiety on this head was often testified to me afterwards
both by letter and conversation  What she felt herself in respect to
endeavours to do good she happily communicated to others with whom she
corresponded or conversed
Time would not permit my continuing so long in the enjoyment of these
meditations on this lovely mount of observation as my heart desired  On
my return home I wrote a few lines to the Dairymans daughter chiefly
dictated by the train of thought which had occupied my mind while I sat
on the hill
On the next Sunday evening I received her reply of which the following
is a transcript
Sunday
Rev Sir
I am this day deprived of an opportunity of attending the house of
God to worship Him  But glory be to his name He is not confined to
time nor place  I feel Him present with me where I am and his
presence makes my paradise for where He is is heaven  I pray God
that a double portion of his grace and Holy Spirit may rest upon you
this day that his blessing may attend all your faithful labours and
that you may find the truth of his Word assuring us that wherever we
assemble together in his name there He is in the midst to bless every
waiting soul
How precious are all his promises  We ought never to doubt the truth
of his Word for He will never deceive us if we go on in faith always
expecting to receive what his goodness waits to give  Dear sir I
have felt it very consoling to read your kind letter today  I feel
thankful to God for ministers in our Church who love and fear his
name there it is where the people in general look for salvation and
there may they ever find it for Jesus sake  May his Word spoken by
you his chosen vessel of grace be made spirit and life to their dead
souls  May it come from you as an instrument in the hands of God as
sharp arrows from a strong archer and strike a deathblow to all
their sins  How I long to see the arrows of conviction fasten on the
minds of those that are hearers of the word and not doers  O sir be
ambitious for the glory of God and the salvation of souls it will add
to the lustre of your crown in glory as well as to your present joy
and peace  We should be willing to spend and be spent in his service
saying Lord may thy will be done by me on earth even as it is by
thy angels in heaven  So you may expect to see his face with joy
and say Here am I Lord and all the souls thou hast given me
It seems wonderful that we should neglect any opportunity of doing
good when there is if it be done from love to God and his creatures
a present reward of grace in reflecting that we are using the talents
committed to our care according to the power and ability which we
receive from Him  God requires not what He has not promised to give
But when we look back and reflect that there have been opportunities
in which we have neglected to take up our cross and speak and act for
God what a dejection of mind we feel  We are then justly filled with
shame  Conscious of being ashamed of Christ we cannot come with that
holy boldness to a throne of grace nor feel that free access when we
make our supplications
We are commanded to provoke one another to love and good works and
where two are agreed together in the things of God they may say
And if our fellowship below
In Jesus be so sweet
What heights of rapture shall we know
When round the throne we meet
Sir I hope Mrs  and you are both of one heart and one mind  Then
you will sweetly agree in all things that make for your present and
eternal happiness  Christ sent his disciples out not singly but two
and two that they might comfort and help each other in those ways and
works which their Lord commanded them to pursue
It has been my lot to have been alone the greatest part of the time
that I have known the ways of God  I therefore find it such a treat
to my soul when I can meet with any who loves to talk of the goodness
and love of God and all his gracious dealings  What a comfortable
reflection to think of spending a whole eternity in that delightful
employmentto tell to listening angels his love immense
unsearchable
Dear sir I thank you for your kindness and condescension in leaving
those that are of high rank and birth in the world to converse with
me who am but a servant here below  But when I consider what a high
calling what honour and dignity God has conferred upon me to be
called his child to be born of his Spirit made an heir of glory and
joint heir with Christ how humble and circumspect should I be in all
my ways as a dutiful and loving child to an affectionate and loving
Father  When I seriously consider these things it fills me with love
and gratitude to God and I do not wish for any higher station nor
envy the rich  I rather pity them if they are not good as well as
great  My blessed Lord was pleased to appear in the form of a
servant and I long to be like Him
I did not feel in so happy a frame for conversation that day nor yet
that liberty to explain my thoughts which I sometimes do  The fault
must have been all in myself for there was nothing in you but what
seemed to evidence a Christian spirit temper and disposition  I
very much wished for an opportunity to converse with you  I feel very
thankful to God that you do take up the cross and despise the shame
if you are found faithful you will soon sit down with Him in glory
I have written to the Rev Mr  to thank him for permitting you to
perform the burial service at  over my dear departed sister and
to tell him of the kind way in which you consented to do it  I should
mention that your manner of reading the service on that day had a
considerable effect on the hearers
Pray excuse all faults and correct my errors  I expect in a few
days to return home to my parents house  We shall rejoice to see you
there
From your humble servant in Christ

It was impossible to view such a correspondent with indifference  I had
just returned from a little cottage assembly where on Sunday evenings
