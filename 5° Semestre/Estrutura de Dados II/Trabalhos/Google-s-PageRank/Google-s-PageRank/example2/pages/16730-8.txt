Since John Norton had come to live in London his idea had been to
put his theory of life which he had defined in his aphorism Let
the world be my monastery into active practice He did not
therefore refuse to accompany Mike Fletcher to restaurants and
musichalls and was satisfied so long as he was allowed to
disassociate and isolate himself from the various women who clustered
about Mike But this evening he viewed the courtesans with more
than the usual liberalism of mind had even laughed loudly when one
fainted and was upheld by anxious friends the most zealous and the
most intimate of whom bathed her white tragic face and listened in
alarm to her incoherent murmurings of Mike darling oh Mike John
had uttered no word of protest until dear old Laura who had never
as Mike said behaved badly to anybody and had been loved by
everybody sat down at their table and the discussion turned on who
was likely to be Bessies first sweetheart Bessie being her youngest
sister whom she was bringing out Then he rose from the table and
wished Mike goodnight but Mikes liking for John was sincere and
preferring his company to Lauras he paid the bill and followed his
friend out of the restaurant and as they walked home together he
listened to his grave and dignified admonitions and though John
could not touch Mikes conscience he always moved his sympathies It
is the shallow and the insincere that inspire ridicule and contempt
and even in the dissipations of the Temple where he had come to
live he had not failed to enforce respect for his convictions and
ideals
In the Temple John had made many acquaintances and friends and about
him were found the contributors to the Pilgrim a weekly newspaper
devoted to young men their doings their amusements their
literature and their art The editor and proprietor of this organ
of amusement was Escott His editorial work was principally done in
his chambers in Temple Gardens where he lived with his friend Mike
Fletcher Of necessity the newspaper drew like gravitation art
and literature but the revelling lords who assembled there were
a disintegrating influence and made John Norton a sort of second
centre and Harding and Thompson and others of various temperaments
and talents found their way to Pump Court Like cuckoos some men are
only really at home in the homes of others others are always ill at
ease when taken out of the surroundings which they have composed to
their ideas and requirements and John Norton was never really John
Norton except when wrapped in his long dressinggown and sitting in
his high canonical chair he listened to Hardings paradoxes or
Thompsons sententious utterances These artistic discussionswhen
in the passion of the moment all the cares of life were lost and
the soul battled in pure ideawere full of attraction and charm
for John and he often thought he had never been so happy And then
Hardings eyes would brighten and his intelligence eager as a wolf
prowling for food ran to and fro seeking and sniffing in all Johns
interests and enthusiasms He was at once fascinated by the scheme
for the pessimistic poem and charmed with the projected voyage in
Thibet and the book on the Great Lamas
One evening a discussion arose as to whether Goethe had stolen from
Schopenhauer or Schopenhauer from Goethe the comparison of mans
life with the sun which seems to set to our earthly eyes but which
in reality never sets but shines on unceasingly The conversation
came to a pause and then Harding said
Mike spoke to me of a pessimistic poem he has in mind did he ever
speak to you about it Escott
I think he said something once but he did not tell me what it was
about He can speak of nothing now but a nun whom he has persuaded
to leave her convent I had thought of having some articles written
about convents and we went to Roehampton While I was talking to my
cousin who is at school there he got into conversation with one of
the sisters I dont know how he managed it but he has persuaded her
to leave the convent and she is coming to see him tomorrow
You dont mean to say cried John that he has persuaded one of
the nuns to leave the convent and to come and see him in Temple
Gardens Such things should not be permitted The Reverend Mother or
some one is in fault That man has been the ruin of hundreds if not
in fact in thought He brings an atmosphere of sensuality wherever
he goes and all must breathe it even the most virtuous are
contaminated I have felt the pollution myself If the woman is
seventy she will look pleased and coquette if he notices her The
fascination is inexplicable
We all experience it and that is why we like Mike said Harding
I heard a lady and a woman whose thoughts are not I assure you
given to straying in that direction say that the first time she saw
him she hated him but soon felt an influence like the fascination
the serpent exercises over the bird stealing over her We find but
ourselves in all that we see hear and feel The world is but our
idea All that women have of goodness sweetness gentleness they
keep for others A woman would not speak to you of what is bad in
her but she would to Mike her sensuality is the side of her nature
which she shows him be she Messalina or St Theresa the proportion
not the principle is altered And this is why Mike cannot believe in
virtue and declares his incredulity to be founded on experience
No doubt no doubt
Fresh brandiesandsodas were poured out fresh cigars were lighted
and John descended the staircase and walked with his friends into
Pump Court where they met Mike Fletcher
What have you been talking about tonight he asked
We wanted Norton to read us the pessimistic poem he is writing but
he says it is in a too unfinished state I told him you were at work
on one on the same subject It is curious that you who differ so
absolutely on essentials should agree to sink your differences at the
very point at which you are most opposed to principle and practice
After a pause Mike said
I suppose it was Schopenhauers dislike of women that first
attracted you He used to call women the shortlegged race that were
only admitted into society a hundred and fifty years ago
Did he say that Oh how good and how true I never could think
a female figure as beautiful as a male A male figure rises to the
head and is a symbol of the intelligence a womans figure sinks to
the inferior parts of the body and is expressive of generation
As he spoke his eyes followed the line and balance of Mikes neck and
shoulders which showed at this moment upon a dark shadow falling
obliquely along an old wall Soft violet eyes in which tenderness
dwelt and the strangely tall and lithe figure was emphasized by the
conventional posethat pose of arm and thigh which the Greeks never
wearied of Seeing him the mind turned from the reserve of the
Christian world towards the frank enjoyment of the Pagan and Johns
solid rhythmless form was as symbolic of dogma as Mikes of the
grace of Athens
As he ascended the stairs having bidden his friends goodnight John
thought of the unfortunate nun whom that man had persuaded to leave
her convent and he wondered if he were justified in living in such
close communion of thought with those whose lives were set in all
opposition to the principles on which he had staked his lifes value
He was thinking and writing the same thoughts as Fletcher They were
swimming in the same waters they were living the same life
Disturbed in mind he walked across the room his spectacles
glimmering on his high nose his dressinggown floating The
manuscript of the poems caught his eyes and he turned over the
sheets his hand trembling violently And if they were antagonistic
to the spirit of his teaching if not to the doctrine that the Church
in her eternal wisdom deemed healthful and wise and conducive to the
best attainable morality and heaven What a fearful responsibility
he was taking upon himself He had learned in bitter experience that
he must seek salvation rather in elimination than in acceptance of
responsibilities But his poems were all he deemed best in the world
For a moment John stood face to face with and he looked into the
eyes of the Church The dome of St Peters a solitary pope
cardinals bishops and priests Oh wonderful symbolization of mans
lust of eternal life
Must he renounce all his beliefs The wish so dear to him that the
unspeakable spectacle of life might cease for ever must he give
thanks for existence because it gave him a small chance of gaining
heaven Then it were well to bring others into the world True it
is that the Church does not advance into such sloughs of optimism
but how different is her teaching from that of the early fathers and
how different is such dull optimism from the severe spirit of early
Christianity
Whither lay his duty Must he burn the poems Far better that they
should burn and he should save his soul from burning A sudden vision
of hell a realistic medival hell full of black devils and ovens
came upon him and he saw himself thrust into flame It seemed to him
certain that his soul was lostso certain that the source of prayer
died within him and he fell prostrate He cursed with curses that
seared his soul as he uttered them Harding that cynical atheist
who had striven to undermine his faith and he shrank from thought of
Fletcher that dirty voluptuary
He went out for long walks hoping by exercise to throw off the gloom
and horror which were thickening in his brain He sought vainly to
arrive at some certain opinions concerning his poems and he weighed
every line not now for cadence and colour but with a view of
determining their ethical tendencies and this poor torn soul stood
trembling on the verge of fearful abyss of unreason and doubt
And when he walked in the streets London appeared a dismal phantom
city The tall houses vanishing in darkness the unending noise the
sudden and vague figures passing some with unclean gaze others in
mysterious haste the courtesans springing from hansoms and entering
their restaurant lurking prostitutes jocular lads and alleys
suggestive of crime All and everything that is city fell violently
upon his mind jarring it and flashing over his brow all the horror
of delirium His pace quickened and he longed for wings to rise out
of the abominable labyrinth
At that moment a gable of a church rose against the sky The gates
were open and one passing through seemed to John like an angel and
obeying the instinct which compels the hunted animal to seek refuge
in the earth he entered and threw himself on his knees Relief
came and the dread about his heart was loosened in the romantic
twilight One poor woman knelt amid the chairs presently she rose
and went to the confessional He waited his turn his eyes fixed on
the candles that burned in the dusky distance
Father forgive me for I have sinned
The priest an old man of gray and shrivelled mien settled his
cassock and mumbled some Latin
I have come to ask your advice father rather than to confess the
sins I have committed in the last week Since I have come to live in
London I have been drawn into the society of the dissolute and the
impure
And you have found that your faith and your morals are being
weakened by association with these men
I have to thank God that I am uninfluenced by them Their society
presents no attractions for me but I am engaged in literary
pursuits and most of the young men with whom I am brought in contact
lead unclean and unholy lives I have striven and have in some
measure succeeded in enforcing respect for my ideals never have
I countenanced indecent conversation although perhaps I have not
always set as stern a face against it as I might have
But you have never joined in it
Never But father I am on the eve of the publication of a volume
of poems and I am grievously afflicted with scruples lest their
tendency does not stand in agreement with the teaching of our holy
Church
Do you fear their morality my son
No no said John in an agitated voice which caused the old man to
raise his eyes and glance inquiringly at his penitent the poem I am
most fearful of is a philosophic poem based on Schopenhauer
I did not catch the name
Schopenhauer if you are acquainted with his works father you will
appreciate my anxieties and will see just where my difficulty lies
I cannot say I can call to mind at this moment any exact idea of his
philosophy does it include a denial of the existence of God
His teaching I admit is atheistic in its tendency but I do not
follow him to his conclusions A part of his theorythat of the
resignation of desire of lifeseems to me not only reconcilable with
the traditions of the Church but may really be said to have been
original and vital in early Christianity however much it may have
been forgotten in these later centuries Jesus Christ our Lord is the
perfect symbol of the denial of the will to live
Jesus Christ our Lord died to save us from the consequences of the
sin of our first parents He died of His own freewill but we may
not live an hour more than is given to us to live though we desire
it with our whole heart We may be called away at any moment
John bent his head before the sublime stupidity of the priest
I was anxious father to give you in a few words some account of
the philosophy which has been engaging my attention so that you
might better understand my difficulties Although Schopenhauer may be
wrong in his theory regarding the will the conclusion he draws from
it namely that we may only find lasting peace in resignation seems
to me well within the dogma of our holy Church
It surprises me that he should hold such opinions for if he does
not acknowledge a future state the present must be everything and
the gratification of the senses the only
I assure you father no one can be more opposed to materialism than
Schopenhauer He holds the world we live in to be a mere
delusionthe veil of Maya
I am afraid my son I cannot speak with any degree of certainty
about either of those authors but I think it my duty to warn you
against inclining too willing an ear to the specious sophistries of
German philosophers It would be well if you were to turn to our
Christian philosophers our great cardinalCardinal Newmanhas over
and over again refuted the enemies of the Church I have forgotten
the name
Schopenhauer
Now I will give you absolution
The burlesque into which his confession had drifted awakened new
terrors in John and sensations of sacrilege He listened devoutly to
the prattle of the priest and to crush the rebellious spirit in him
he promised to submit his poems and he did not allow himself to
think the old man incapable of understanding them But he knew he
would not submit those poems and turning from the degradation he
faced a command which had suddenly come upon him A great battle
raged and growing at every moment less conscious of all save his
souls salvation he walked through the streets his stick held
forward like a church candle
He walked through the city seeing it not and hearing all cruel
voices dying to onethis I can only attain salvation by the
elimination of all responsibilities There is therefore but one
course to adopt Decision came upon him like the surgeons knife It
was in the cold darkness of his rooms in Pump Court He raised his
face deadly pale from his hands but gradually it went aflame with
the joy and rapture of sacrifice and taking his manuscript he
lighted it in the gas He held it for a few moments till it was well
on fire and then threw it all blazing under the grate
CHAPTER II
An odour of spirits evaporated in the warm winds of May which came
through the open window The rich velvet sofa of early English design
was littered with proofs and copies of the Pilgrim and the stamped
velvet was two shades richer in tone than the pale deadred of the
floorcloth Small pictures in light frames harmonized with a green
paper of long interlacing leaves On the right the grand piano and
the slender brass lamps and the impression of refinement and taste
was continued for between the blue chintz curtains the river lay
soft as a picture of old Venice The beauty of the water full of
the shadows of hay and sails many forms of chimneys wharfs and
warehouses made panoramic and picturesque by the motion of the great
hayboats were surely wanted for the windows of this beautiful
apartment
Mike and Frank stood facing the view and talked of Lily Young whom
Mike was momentarily expecting
You know as much about it as I do It was only just at the end that
you spoke to your cousin and I got in a few words
What did you say
What could I say Something to the effect that the convent must be a
very happy home
How did you know she cared for you
I always know that The second time we went there she told me she
was going to leave the convent I asked her what had decided her to
take that step and she looked at methat thirsting look which women
cannot repress I said I hoped I should see her when she came to
London she said she hoped so too Then I knew it was all right I
pressed her hand and when we went again I said she would find a
letter waiting for her at the postoffice Somehow she got the letter
sooner than I expected and wrote to say shed come here if she
could Here is the letter But will she come
Even if she does I dont see what good it will do you it isnt as
if you were really in love with her
I believe I am in love it sounds rather awful doesnt it but she
is wondrous sweet I want to be true to her I want to live for her
Im not half so bad as you think I am I have often tried to be
constant and now I mean to be This ceaseless desire of change is
very stupid and it leads to nothing Im sick of change and would
think of none but her You have no idea how I have altered since I
have seen her I used to desire all women I wrote a ballade the
other day on the women of two centuries hence Is it not shocking
to think that we shall lie mouldering in our graves while women are
dancing and kissing They will not even know that I lived and was
loved It will not occur to them to say as they undress of an
evening Were he alive today we might love him
THE BALLADE OF DON JUAN DEAD
My days for singing and loving are over
And stark I lie in my narrow bed
I care not at all if roses cover
Or if above me the snow is spread
I am weary of dreaming of my sweet dead
All gone like me unto common clay
Lifes bowers are full of loves fair fray
Of piercing kisses and subtle snares
So gallants are conquered ah well away
My love was stronger and fiercer than theirs
O happy moths that now flit and hover
From the blossom of white to the blossom of red
Take heed for I was a lordly lover
Till the little day of my life had sped
As straight as a pinetree a golden head
And eyes as blue as an austral bay
Ladies when loosing your evening array
Reflect had you lived in my years my prayers
Might have won you from weakly lovers away
My love was stronger and fiercer than theirs
Through the song of the thrush and the pipe of the plover
Sweet voices come down through the binding lead
O queens that every age must discover
For men that mans delight may be fed
Oh sister queens to the queens I wed
For the space of a year a month a day
No thirst but mine could your thirst allay
And oh for an hour of life my dears
To kiss you to laugh at your lovers dismay
My love was stronger and fiercer than theirs
ENVOI
Prince was I ever of festival gay
And time never silvered my locks with gray
The love of your lovers is as hope that despairs
So think of me sometimes dear ladies I pray
My love was stronger and fiercer than theirs
It is like all your poetrymerely meretricious glitter there is no
heart in it That a man should like to have a nice mistress a girl
he is really fond of is simple enough but lamentation over the
limbo of unborn loveliness is to my mind sheer nonsense
Mike laughed
Of course it is silly but I cannot alter it it is the sex and not
any individual woman that attracts me I enter a ballroom and I see
one one whom I have never seen before and I say It is she whom I
have sought I can love her I am always disappointed but hope is
born again in every fresh face Women are so common when they have
loved you
Startled by his words Mike strove to measure the thought
I can see nothing interesting in the fact that it is natural to you
to behave badly to every woman who gives you a chance of deceiving
her Thats what it amounts to At the end of a week youll tire of
this new girl as you did of the others I think it a great shame It
isnt gentlemanly
Mike winced at the word gentlemanly For a moment he thought of
resentment but his natural amiability predominated and he said
I hope not I really do think I can love this one she isnt like
the others Besides I shall be much happier There is I know a
great sweetness in constancy I long for this sweetness Seeing by
Franks face that he was still angry he pursued his thoughts in the
line which he fancied would be most agreeable he did so without
violence to his feelings It was as natural to him to think one way
as another Mikes sycophancy was so innate that it did not appear
and was therefore almost invariably successful I have been the
lover of scores of women but I never loved one I have always hoped
to love it is love that I seek I find lovetokens and I do not know
who were the givers I have possessed nothing but the flesh and I
have always looked beyond the flesh I never sought a woman for her
beauty I dreamed of a companion one who would share each thought
I have dreamed of a woman to whom I could bring my poetry who could
comprehend all sorrows and with whom I might deplore the sadness of
life until we forget it was sad and I have been given some more or
less imperfect flesh
I said Frank dont care a rap for your bluestockings I like a
girl to look pretty and sweet in a muslin dress her hair with the
sun on it slipping over her shoulders a large hat throwing a shadow
over the garden of her face I like her to come and sit on my knee in
the twilight before dinner to come behind me when I am working and
put her hand on my forehead saying Poor old man you are tired
And you could love one girl all your lifeLizzie Baker for
instance and you could give up all women for one and never wander
again free to gather
It is always the same thing
No that is just what it is not The last one was thin this one
is fat the last one was tall this one is tiny The last one was
stupid this one is witty Some men seek the source of the Nile I
the lace of a bodice A new love is a voyage of discovery What is
her furniture like What will she say What are her opinions of love
But when you have been a womans lover a month you know her morally
and physically Society is based on the family The family alone
survives it floats like an ark over every raging flood But you
may understand without being able to accept and I cannot accept
although I understand and love family life What promiscuity of body
and mind The idea of never being alone fills me with horror to lose
that secret self which like a shy bird flies out of sight in the
day but is with you oh how intensely in the morning
Nothing pleases you so much as to be allowed to talk nonsense about
yourself
Mike laughed
Let me have those operaglasses That woman sitting on the bench is
like her
The trees of the embankment waved along the laughing water and in
scores the sparrows flitted across the sleek green sward The porter
in his bright uniform cocked hat and brass buttons explained the
way out to a woman Her child wore a red sash and stooped to play
with a cat that came along the railings its tail high in the air
They know nothing of Lily Young Mike said to himself and knowing
the porter could not interfere he wondered what he would think if he
knew all If she comes nothing can save her she must and shall be
mine
Waterloo Bridge stood high above the river level and lovely Over
Charing Cross the brightness was full of spires and pinnacles but
Southwark shore was lost in flat dimness Then the sun glowed and
Westminster ascended tall and romantic St Thomass and St Johns
floating in pale enchantment and beneath the haze that heaved and
drifted revealing coalbarges moored by the Southwark shore lay a
sheet of gold The candour of the morning laughed upon the river
and there came a little steamer into the dazzling water her smoke
heeling over coiling and uncoiling like a snake and casting
tremendous shadowin her train a line of boats laden to the edge
with deal planks Then the haze heaved and London disappeared became
again a gray city faint and far awayfaint as spires seem in a
dream Again and again the haze wreathed and went out discovering
wharfs and gold inscriptions uncovering barges aground upon the
purple slime of the Southwark shore their yellow yards pointing like
birds with outstretched necks
The smoke of the little steamer curled and rolled over now like a
great snake now like a great bird hovering with a snake in its
talons and the little steamer made pluckily for Blackfriars Carts
and hansoms vans and brewers vans all silhouetting Trains slip
past obliterating with white whiffs the delicate distances the
perplexing distances that in London are delicate and perplexing as
a spiders web Great hayboats yellow in the sun brown in the
shadowgreat hayboats came by their sails scarce filled with the
light breeze standing high they sailed slowly and picturesquely
with men thrown in all attitudes somnolent in sunshine and pungent
odourone only at work wielding the great rudder
Ah if she would not disappoint me if she would only come I would
give my life not to be disappointed Three oclock She said she
would be here by three if she came at all I think I could love
herI am sure of it it would be impossible to weary of herso
fraila white blonde She said she would come I know she wanted
to This waiting is agony Oh if I were only goodlooking
Whatever power I have over women I have acquired it was the desire
to please women that gave me whatever power I possess I was as soft
as wax and in the fingers of desire was modified and moulded You
did not know me when I was a boyI was hideous It seemed to me
impossible that women could love men Women seemed to me so beautiful
and desirable men so hideous and revolting Could they touch us
without a revulsion of feeling Could they really desire us That
is why I could not bear to give women money nor a present of any
kindno not even a flower If I did all my pleasure was gone
I could not help thinking it was for what they got out of me that
they liked me I longed to penetrate the mystery of womens life
It seemed to me cruel that the differences between the sexes should
never be allowed to dwindle but should be strictly maintained
through all the observances of life There were beautiful beings
walking by us of whom we knew nothingirreparably separated from
us I wanted to be with this sex as a shadow is with its object
You didnt find many opportunities of gratifying your tastes in
Cashel
No indeed Of course the women about the town were not to be
thought of Unpleasant memories seemed to check his flow of words
Without noticing his embarrassment Frank said
After France it must have been a horrible change to come to Ireland
How old were you
About fourteen I could not endure the place Every day was so
appallingly like the last There was nothing for me to do but to
dream I dreamed of everything I longed to get alone and let my
fancy wanderweaving tales of which I was the hero building castles
of which I was the lord
I remember always hearing of your riding and shooting No one knew
of your literary tastes I dont mind telling you that Mount Rorke
often suspected you of being a bit of a poacher
Mike laughed
I believe I have knocked down a pheasant or two I was an odd
mixturehalf a man of action half a man of dreams My position in
Cashel was unbearable My mother was a lady my fatheryou know how
he had let himself down You cannot imagine the yearnings of a poor
boy you were brought up in all elegance and refinement That
beautiful park On afternoons I used to walk there and I remember
the very moments I passed under the foliage of the great beeches and
lay down to dream I used to wander to the outskirts of the wood as
near as I dared to the pleasuregrounds and looking on the towers
strove to imagine the life there The bitterest curses lie in the
hearts of young men who understanding refinement and elegance see
it for ever out of their reach I used to watch the parade of dresses
passing on the summer lawns between the firs and flowering trees
What graceful and noble words were spokenand that man walking into
the poetry of the laburnum gold did he put his arm about her And I
wondered what silken ankles moved beneath her skirts My brain was on
fire and I was crazed I thought I should never hold a lady in my
arms A lady all the delicacy of silk and lace highheeled shoes
and the scent and colour of hair that a coiffeur has braided
I think you are mad
Mike laughed and continued
I was so when I was sixteen There was a girl staying there Her
hair was copper and her flesh was pink and white Her waist you
could span it I saw her walking one day on
You must mean Lady Alice Hargood a very tall girl
