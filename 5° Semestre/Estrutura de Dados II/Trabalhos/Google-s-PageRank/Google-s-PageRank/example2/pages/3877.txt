she is I perceive affiliated to the Jesuits and what she says does
not originate with herself  She is commissioned by some reverend father
and I will know by whom  Spies were accordingly set to watch her
movements and they discovered that one Father de Saci and still more
particularly one Father Frey guided this ladys conduct  What a
pity said Madame to me that the Abbe Chauvelin cannot know this He
was the most formidable enemy of the reverend fathers  Madame du Chiron
always looked upon me as a Jansenist because I would not espouse the
interests of the good fathers with as much warmth as she did
Madame is completely absorbed in the Abbe de Bernis whom she thinks
capable of anything she talks of him incessantly  Apropos of this
Abbe I must relate an anecdote which almost makes one believe in
conjurors  A year or fifteen months before her disgrace Madame de
Pompadour being at Fontainebleau sat down to write at a desk over
which hung a portrait of the King  While she was shutting the desk
after she had finished writing the picture fell and struck her
violently on the head  The persons who saw the accident were alarmed
and sent for Dr Quesnay  He asked the circumstances of the case and
ordered bleeding and anodynes  Just as she had been bled Madame de
Brancas entered and saw us all in confusion and agitation and Madame
lying on her chaiselongue  She asked what was the matter and was told
After having expressed her regret and having consoled her she said I
ask it as a favour of Madame and of the King who had just come in
that they will instantly send a courier to the Abbe de Bernis and that
the Marquise will have the goodness to write a letter merely requesting
him to inform her what his fortunetellers told him and to withhold
nothing from the fear of making her uneasy  The thing was done as she
desired and she then told us that La Bontemps had predicted from the
dregs in the coffeecup in which she read everything that the head of
her best friend was in danger but that no fatal consequences would
ensue
The next day the Abbe wrote word that Madame Bontemps also said to him
You came into the world almost black and that this was the fact  This
colour which lasted for some time was attributed to a picture which
hung at the foot of his mothers bed and which she often looked at  It
represented a Moor bringing to Cleopatra a basket of flowers containing
the asp by whose bite she destroyed herself  He said that she also told
him You have a great deal of money about you but it does not belong to
you and that he had actually in his pocket two hundred Louis for the
Duc de La Valliere  Lastly he informed us that she said looking in the
cup I see one of your friendsthe besta distinguished lady
threatened with an accident that he confessed that in spite of all his
philosophy he turned pale that she remarked this looked again into the
cup and continued Her head will be slightly in danger but of this no
appearance will remain half an hour afterwards  It was impossible to
doubt the facts  They appeared so surprising to the King that he
desired some inquiry to be made concerning the fortuneteller  Madame
however protected her from the pursuit of the Police
A man who was quite as astonishing as this fortuneteller often visited
Madame de Pompadour  This was the Comte de St Germain who wished to
have it believed that he had lived several centuries
St Germain was an adepta worthy predecessor of Cagliostro who
expected to live five hundred years  The Count de St Germain pretended
to have already lived two thousand and according to him the account
was still running  He went so far as to claim the power of transmitting
the gift of long life  One day calling upon his servant to bear
witness to a fact that went pretty far back the man replied I have no
recollection of it sir you forget that I have only had the honour of
serving you for five hundred years
St Germain like all other charlatans of this sort assumed a theatrical
magnificence and an air of science calculated to deceive the vulgar
His best instrument of deception was the phantasmagoria and as by means
of this abuse of the science of optics he called up shades which were
asked for and almost always recognised his correspondence with the
other world was a thing proved by the concurrent testimony of numerous
witnesses
He played the same game in London Venice and Holland but he constantly
regretted Paris where his miracles were never questioned
St Germain passed his latter days at the Court of the Prince of Hesse
Cassel and died at Plewig in 1784 in the midst of his enthusiastic
disciples and to their infinite astonishment at his sharing the common
destiny
One day at her toilet Madame said to him in my presence What was the
personal appearance of Francis I  He was a King I should have
likedHe was indeed very captivating said St Germain and he
proceeded to describe his face and person as one does that of a man one
has accurately observed  It is a pity he was too ardent  I could have
given him some good advice which would have saved him from all his
misfortunes but he would not have followed it for it seems as if a
fatality attended Princes forcing them to shut their ears those of the
mind at least to the best advice and especially in the most critical
momentsAnd the Constable said Madame what do you say of
himI cannot say much good or much harm of him replied he  Was
the Court of Francis I very brilliantVery brilliant but those of
his grandsons infinitely surpassed it  In the time of Mary Stuart and
Margaret of Valois it was a land of enchantmenta temple sacred to
pleasures of every kind those of the mind were not neglected  The two
Queens were learned wrote verses and spoke with captivating grace and
eloquence  Madame said laughing You seem to have seen all thisI
have an excellent memory said he and have read the history of France
with great care  I sometimes amuse myself not by making but by letting
it be believed that I lived in old timesYou do not tell me your age
however and you give yourself out for very old  The Comtesse de Gergy
who was Ambassadress to Venice I think fifty years ago says she knew
you there exactly what you are nowIt is true Madame that I have
known Madame de Gergy a long timeBut according to what she says
you would be more than a hundredThat is not impossible said he
laughing but it is I allow still more possible that Madame de Gergy
for whom I have the greatest respect may be in her dotageYou have
given her an elixir the effect of which is surprising She declares that
for a long time she has felt as if she was only fourandtwenty years of
age why dont you give some to the KingAh Madame said he with a
sort of terror I must be mad to think of giving the King an unknown
drug  I went into my room to write down this conversation Some days
afterwards the King Madame de Pompadour some Lords of the Court and
the Comte de St Germain were talking about his secret for causing the
spots in diamonds to disappear  The King ordered a diamond of middling
size which had a spot to be brought  It was weighed and the King said
to the Count It is valued at two hundred and forty louis but it would
be worth four hundred if it had no spot  Will you try to put a hundred
and sixty louis into my pocket  He examined it carefully and said It
may be done and I will bring it you again in a month  At the time
appointed the Count brought back the diamond without a spot and gave it
to the King  It was wrapped in a cloth of amianthus which he took off
The King had it weighed and found it but very little diminished  The
King sent it to his jeweller by M de Gontaut without telling him
anything of what had passed  The jeweller gave three hundred and eighty
louis for it  The King however sent for it back again and kept it as
a curiosity  He could not overcome his surprise and said that M de St
Germain must be worth millions especially if he had also the secret of
making large diamonds out of a number of small ones  He neither said
that he had nor that he had not but he positively asserted that he
could make pearls grow and give them the finest water  The King paid
him great attention and so did Madame de Pompadour  It was from her I
learnt what I have just related M Queanay said talking of the pearls
They are produced by a disease in the oyster  It is possible to know
the cause of it but be that as it may he is not the less a quack
since he pretends to have the elixir vitae and to have lived several
centuries  Our master is however infatuated by him and sometimes
talks of him as if his descent were illustrious
I have seen him frequently he appeared to be about fifty he was neither
fat nor thin he had an acute intelligent look dressed very simply but
in good taste he wore very fine diamonds in his rings watch and
snuffbox  He came one day to visit Madame de Pompadour at a time
when the Court was in full splendour with knee and shoebuckles of
diamonds so fine and brilliant that Madame said she did not believe the
King had any equal to them  He went into the antechamber to take them
off and brought them to be examined they were compared with others in
the room and the Duc de Gontaut who was present said they were worth
at least eight thousand louis  He wore at the same time a snuffbox of
inestimable value and ruby sleevebuttons which were perfectly
dazzling  Nobody could find out by what means this man became so rich
and so remarkable but the King would not suffer him to be spoken of with
ridicule or contempt  He was said to be a bastard son of the King of
Portugal
I learnt from M de Marigny that the relations of the good little
Marechale de Mirepoix had been extremely severe upon her for what they
called the baseness of her conduct with regard to Madame de Pompadour
They said she held the stones of the cherries which Madame ate in her
carriage in her beautiful little hands and that she sate in the front
of the carriage while Madame occupied the whole seat in the inside  The
truth was that in going to Crecy on an insupportably hot day they
both wished to sit alone that they might be cooler and as to the matter
of the cherries the villagers having brought them some they ate them to
refresh themselves while the horses were changed and the Marechal
emptied her pockethandkerchief into which they had both thrown the
cherrystones out of the carriage window  The people who were changing
the horses had given their own version of the affair
I had as you know a very pretty room at Madames hotel whither I
generally went privately  I had one day had visits from two or three
Paris representatives who told me news and Madame having sent for me
I went to her and found her with M de Gontaut  I could not help
instantly saying to her You must be much pleased Madame at the noble
action of the Marquis de   Madame replied drily Hold your
tongue and listen to what I have to say to you  I returned to my
little room where I found the Comtesse dAmblimont to whom I mentioned
Madames reception of me  I know what is the matter said she it has
no relation to you  I will explain it to you  The Marquis de has
told all Paris that some days ago going home at night alone and on
foot he heard cries in a street called Ferou which is dark and in
great part arched over that he drew his sword and went down the
street in which he saw by the light of a lamp a very handsome woman
to whom some ruffians were offering violence that he approached and
that the woman cried out Save me save me that he rushed upon the
wretches two of whom fought him sword in hand whilst a third held the
woman and tried to stop her mouth that he wounded one in the arm and
that the ruffians hearing people pass at the end of the street and
fearing they might come to his assistance fled that he went up to the
lady who told him that they were not robbers but villains one of whom
was desperately in love with her and that the lady knew not how to
express her gratitude that she had begged him not to follow her after
he had conducted her to a fiacre that she would not tell him her name
but that she insisted on his accepting a little ring as a token of
remembrance and that she promised to see him again and to tell him her
whole history if he gave her his address that he complied with this
request of the lady whom he represented as a charming person and who
in the overflowing of her gratitude embraced him several times  This is
all very fine so far said Madame dAmblimont but hear the rest  The
Marquis de exhibited himself everywhere the next day with a black ribbon
bound round his arm near the wrist in which part he said he had
received a wound  He related his story to everybody and everybody
commented upon it after his own fashion  He went to dine with the
Dauphin who spoke to him of his bravery and of his fair unknown and
told him that he had already complimented the Duc de C on the affair
I forgot to tell you continued Madame dAmblimont that on the very
night of the adventure he called on Madame dEstillac an old gambler
whose house is open till four in the morning that everybody there was
surprised at the disordered state in which he appeared that his bagwig
had fallen off one skirt of his coat was cut and his right hand
bleeding  That they instantly bound it up and gave him some Rota wine
Four days ago the Duc de C supped with the King and sat near M de
St Florentin  He talked to him of his relations adventure and asked
him if he had made any inquiries concerning the lady  M de St
Florentin coldly answered No and M de C remarked on asking him
some further questions that he kept his eyes firmed on his plate
looking embarrassed and answered in monosyllables  He asked him the
reason of this upon which M de Florentin told him that it was extremely
distressing to him to see him under such a mistake  How can you know
that supposing it to be the fact said M de  Nothing is more
easy to prove replied M de St Florentin  You may imagine that as
soon as I was informed of the Marquis de s adventure I set on
foot inquiries the result of which was that on the night when this
affair was said to have taken place a party of the watch was set in
ambuscade in this very street for the purpose of catching a thief who
was coming out of the gaming house that this party was there four hours
and heard not the slightest noise  M de C was greatly incensed at this
recital which M de St Florentin ought indeed to have communicated to
the King  He has ordered or will order his relation to retire to his
province
After this you will judge my dear whether you were very likely to be
graciously received when you went openmouthed with your compliment to
the Marquise  This adventure continued she reminded the King of one
which occurred about fifteen years ago  The Comte dE who was what
is called enfant dhonneur to the Dauphin and about fourteen years of
age came into the Dauphins apartments one evening with his bagwig
snatched off and his ruffles torn and said that having walked rather
late near the piece of water des Suisses he had been attacked by two
robbers that he had refused to give them anything drawn his sword and
put himself in an attitude of defence that one of the robbers was armed
with a sword the other with a large stick from which he had received
several blows but that he had wounded one in the arm and that hearing
a noise at that moment they had fled  But unluckily for the little
Count it was known that people were on the spot at the precise time he
mentioned and had heard nothing  The Count was pardoned on account of
his youth  The Dauphin made him confess the truth and it was looked
upon as a childish freak to set people talking about him
The King disliked the King of Prussia because he knew that the latter was
in the habit of jesting upon his mistress and the kind of life he led
It was Fredericks fault as I have heard it said that the King was not
his most steadfast ally and friend as much as sovereigns can be towards
each other but the jestings of Frederick had stung him and made him
conclude the treaty of Versailles  One day he entered Madames
apartment with a paper in his hand and said The King of Prussia is
certainly a great man he loves men of talent and like Louis XIV he
wishes to make Europe ring with his favours towards foreign savans There
is a letter from him addressed to Milord Marshal
George Keith better known under the name of Milord Marshal was the
eldest son of William Keith Earl Marshal of Scotland  He was an avowed
partisan of the Stuarts and did not lay down the arms he had taken up in
their cause until it became utterly desperate and drew upon its
defenders useless dangers  When they were driven from their country he
renounced it and took up his residence successively in France Prussia
Spain and Italy  The delicious country and climate of Valencia he
preferred above any other
Milord Marshal died in the month of May 1778  It was he who said to
Madame Geoffrin speaking of his brother who was fieldmarshal in the
Prussian service and died on the field of honour My brother leaves me
the most glorious inheritance he had just laid the whole of Bohemia
under contribution his property does not amount to seventy ducats  A
eulogium on Milord Marshal by DAlembert is extant  It is the most
cruelly mangled of all his works by Linguet
ordering him to acquaint a superieur man of my kingdom DAlembert
that he has granted him a pension and looking at the letter he read
the following words You must know that there is in Paris a man of the
greatest merit whose fortune is not proportionate to his talents and
character  I may serve as eyes to the blind goddess and repair in some
measure the injustice and I beg you to offer on that account  I flatter
myself that he will accept this pension because of the pleasure I shall
feel in obliging a man who joins beauty of character to the most sublime
intellectual talents  The King here stopped on seeing MM de Ayen and
de Gontaut enter and then recommenced reading the letter to them and
added It was given me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to whom it
was confided by Milord Marshal for the purpose of obtaining my
permission for this sublime genius to accept the favour  But said the
King what do you think is the amount  Some said six eight ten
thousand livres  You have not guessed said the King it is twelve
hundred livresFor sublime talents said the Duc dAyen it is not
much  But the philosophers will make Europe resound with this letter
and the King of Prussia will have the pleasure of making a great noise at
little expense
The Chevalier de CourtenThe Chevalier de Courten was a Swiss and a
man of talentwho had been in Prussia came in and hearing this
story told said I have seen what is much better than that passing
through a village in Prussia I got out at the posthouse while I was
waiting for horses and the postmaster who was a captain in the Prussian
service showed me several letters in Fredericks handwriting addressed
to his uncle who was a man of rank promising him to provide for his
nephews the provision he made for this the eldest of these nephews who
was dreadfully wounded was the postmastership which he then held  M
de Marigny related this story at Quesnays and added that the man of
genius above mentioned was DAlembert and that the King had permitted
him to accept the pension  He added that his sister had suggested to
the King that he had better give DAlembert a pension of twice the value
and forbid him to take the King of Prussias  This advice he would not
take because he looked upon DAlembert as an infidel  M de Marigny
took a copy of the letter which he lent me
A certain nobleman at one time affected to cast tender glances on
Madame Adelaide  She was wholly unconscious of it but as there are
Arguses at Court the King was of course told of it and indeed he
thought he had perceived it himself  I know that he came into Madame de
Pompadours room one day in a great passion and said Would you
believe that there is a man in my Court insolent enough to dare to raise
his eyes to one of my daughters  Madame had never seen him so
exasperated and this illustrious nobleman was advised to feign a
necessity for visiting his estates  He remained there two months Madame
told me long after that she thought that there were no tortures to
which the King would not have condemned any man who had seduced one of
his daughters  Madame Adelaide at the time in question was a charming
person and united infinite grace and much talent to a most agreeable
face
A courier brought Madame de Pompadour a letter on reading which she
burst into tears  It contained the intelligence of the battle of
Rosbach which M de Soubise sent her with all the details  I heard her
say to the Marechal de BelleIsle wiping her eyes M de Soubise is
inconsolable he does not try to excuse his conduct he sees nothing but
the disastrous fortune which pursues himM de Soubise must however
have many things to urge in his own behalf said M de BelleIsle and
so I told the KingIt is very noble in you Marshal not to suffer an
unfortunate man to be overwhelmed the public are furious against him
and what has he done to deserve itThere is not a more honourable nor
a kinder man in the world  I only fulfil my duty in doing justice to the
truth and to a man for whom I have the most profound esteem  The King
will explain to you Madame how M de Soubise was forced to give battle
by the Prince of SageHildbourgshausen whose troops fled first and
carried along the French troops  Madame would have embraced the old
Marshal if she had dared she was so delighted with him
M de Soubise having gained a battle was made Marshal of France Madame
was enchanted with her friends success  But either it was unimportant
or the public were offended at his promotion nobody talked of it but
Madames friends  This unpopularity was concealed from her and she said
to Colin her steward at her toilet Are you not delighted at the
victory M de Soubise has gained  What does the public say of it  He
has taken his revenge well  Colin was embarrassed and knew not what to
answer  As she pressed him further he replied that he had been ill and
had seen nobody for a week
M de Marigny came to see me one day very much out of humour  I asked
him the cause  I have said he just been intreating my sister not to
make M le NormanddeMezi Minister of the Marine  I told her that she
was heaping coals of fire upon her own head  A favourite ought not to
multiply the points of attack upon herself  The Doctor entered  You
said the Doctor are worth your weight in gold for the good sense and
capacity you have shewn in your office and for your moderation but you
will never be appreciated as you deserve your advice is excellent there
will never be a ship taken but Madame will be held responsible for it to
the public and you are very wise not to think of being in the Ministry
yourself
One day when I was at Paris I went to dine with the Doctor who
happened to be there at the same time there were contrary to his usual
custom a good many people and among others a handsome young Master of
the Requests who took a title from some place the name of which I have
forgotten but who was a son of M Turgot the prevot des marchands
They talked a great deal about administration which was not very amusing
to me they then fell upon the subject of the love Frenchmen bear to
their Kings  M Turgot here joined in the conversation and said This
is not a blind attachment it is a deeply rooted sentiment arising from
an indistinct recollection of great benefits  The French nationI may
go fartherEurope and all mankind owe to a King of France I have
forgotten his namePhillip the Longwhatever liberty they enjoy He
established communes and conferred on an immense number of men a civil
existence  I am aware that it may be said with justice that he served
his own interests by granting these franchises that the cities paid him
taxes and that his design was to use them as instruments of weakening
the power of great nobles but what does that prove but that this
measure was at once useful politic and humane  From Kings in general
the conversation turned upon Louis XV and M Turgot remarked that his
reign would be always celebrated for the advancement of the sciences the
progress of knowledge and of philosophy  He added that Louis XV  was
deficient in the quality which Louis XIV  possessed to excess that is
to say in a good opinion of himself that he was wellinformed that
nobody was more perfectly master of the topography of France that his
opinion in the Council was always the most judicious and that it was
much to be lamented that he had not more confidence in himself or that
he did not rely upon some Minister who enjoyed the confidence of the
nation  Everybody agreed with him  I begged M Quesnay to write down
what young Turgot had said and showed it to Madame  She praised this
Master of the Requests greatly and spoke of him to the King  It is a
good breed said he
One day I went out to walk and saw on my return a great many people
going and coming and speaking to each other privately it was evident
that something extraordinary had happened  I asked a person of my
acquaintance what was the matter  Alas said he with tears in his
eyes some assassins who had formed the project of murdering the King
have inflicted several wounds on a gardeducorps who overheard them in
a dark corridor he is carried to the hospital and as he has described
the colour of these mens coats the Police are in quest of them in all
directions and some people dressed in clothes of that colour are
already arrested  I saw Madame with M de Gontaut and I hastened home
She found her door besieged by a multitude of people and was alarmed
when she got in she found the Comte de Noailles  What is all this
Count  said she  He said he was come expressly to speak to her and
they retired to her closet together  The conference was not long  I had
remained in the drawingroom with Madames equerry the Chevalier de
Solent Gourbillon her valet de chambre and some strangers  A great
many details were related but the wounds being little more than
scratches and the gardeducorps having let fall some contradictions it
was thought that he was an impostor who had invented all this story to
bring himself into favour  Before the night was over this was proved to
be the fact and I believe from his own confession  The King came
that evening to see Madame de Pompadour he spoke of this occurrence
with great sang froid and said The gentleman who wanted to kill me was
a wicked madman this is a low scoundrel
When he spoke of Damiens which was only while his trial lasted he never
called him anything but that gentleman
I have heard it said that he proposed having him shut up in a dungeon for
life but that the horrible nature of the crime made the judges insist
upon his suffering all the tortures inflicted upon like occasions  Great
numbers many of them women had a barbarous curiosity to witness the
execution amongst others Madame de P a very beautiful woman and
the wife of a Farmer General  She hired two places at a window for
twelve Louis and played a game of cards in the room whilst waiting for
the execution to begin  On this being told to the King he covered his
eyes with his hands and exclaimed Fi la Vilaine  I have been told
that she and others thought to pay their court in this way and
signalise their attachment to the Kings person
Two things were related to me by M Duclos at the time of the attempt on
the Kings life
The first relative to the Comte de Sponheim who was the Duc de
DeuxPonts and next in succession to the Palatinate and Electorate of
Bavaria  He was thought to be a great friend to the King and had made
several long sojourns in France  He came frequently to see Madame M
Duclos told us that the Duc de DeuxPonts having learned at DeuxPonts
the attempt on the Kings life immediately set out in a carriage for
Versailles But remark said he the spirit of courtisanerie of a
Prince who may be Elector of Bavaria and the Palatinate tomorrow This
was not enough  When he arrived within ten leagues of Paris he put on
an enormous pair of jackboots mounted a posthorse and arrived in the
court of the palace cracking his whip  If this had been real impatience
and not charlatanism he would have taken horse twenty leagues from
ParisI dont agree with you said a gentleman whom I did not know
impatience sometimes seizes one towards the end of an undertaking and
one employs the readiest means then in ones power Besides the Duc de
DeuxPonts might wish by showing himself thus on horseback to serve the
King to whom he is attached by proving to Frenchmen how greatly he is
beloved and honoured in other countries Duclos resumed Well said
he do you know the story of M de C The first day the King saw
company after the attempt of Damiens M de C pushed so vigorously
through the crowd that he was one of the first to come into the Kings
presence but he had on so shabby a black coat that it caught the Kings
attention who burst out laughing and said Look at C he has had
the skirt of his coat torn off M de C looked as if he was only
then first conscious of his loss and said Sire there is such a
multitude hurrying to see Your Majesty that I was obliged to fight my
way through them and in the effort my coat has been
tornFortunately it was not worth much said the Marquis de Souvre
and you could not have chosen a worse one to sacrifice on the
occasion
Madame de Pompadour had been very judiciously advised to get her husband
M le Normand sent to Constantinople as Ambassador  This would have a
little diminished the scandal caused by seeing Madame de Pompadour with
the title of Marquise at Court and her husband Farmer General at Paris
But he was so attached to a Paris life and to his opera habits that he
could not be prevailed upon to go  Madame employed a certain M
dArboulin with whom she had been acquainted before she was at Court to
negotiate this affair  He applied to a Mademoiselle Rem who had been an
operadancer and who was M le Normands mistress  She made him very
fine promises but she was like him and preferred a Paris life  She
would do nothing in it
At the time that plays were acted in the little apartments I obtained a
lieutenancy for one of my relations by a singular means which proves
the value the greatest people set upon the slightest access to the Court
Madame did not like to ask anything of M dArgenson and being pressed
by my family who could not imagine that situated as I was it could be
difficult for me to obtain a command for a good soldier I determined to
go and ask the Comte dArgenson  I made my request and presented my
memorial  He received me coldly and gave me vague answers  I went out
and the Marquis de V who was in his closet followed me  You wish
to obtain a command said he there is one vacant which is promised me
for one of my proteges but if you will do me a favour in return or
obtain one for me I will give it to you  I want to be a police officer
and you have it in your power to get me a place  I told him I did not
understand the purport of his jest  I will tell you said he
Tartuffe is going to be acted in the cabinets and there is the part of
a police officer which only consists of a few lines  Prevail upon
Madame de Pompadour to assign me that part and the command is yours I
promised nothing but I related the history to Madame who said she would
arrange it for me  The thing was done and I obtained the command and
the Marquis de V thanked Madame as if she had made him a Duke
The King was often annoyed by the Parliaments and said a very remarkable
thing concerning them which M de Gontaut repeated to Doctor Quesnay in
my presence  Yesterday said he the King walked up and down the room
with an anxious air  Madame de Pompadour asked him if he was uneasy
about his health as he had been for some time rather unwell  No
replied he but I am greatly annoyed by all these remonstrancesWhat
can come of them said she that need seriously disquiet Your Majesty
Are you not master of the Parliaments as well as of all the rest of the
kingdomThat is true said the King but if it had not been for
these counsellors and presidents I should never have been stabbed by
that gentleman he always called Damiens so  Ah  Sire cried Madame
de Pompadour  Read the trial said he  It was the language of those
gentlemen he names which turned his headBut said Madame I have
often thought that if the ArchbishopM de Beaumontcould be sent to
RomeFind anybody who will accomplish that business and I will give
him whatever he pleases  Quesnay said the King was right in all he had
uttered  The Archbishop was exiled shortly after and the King was
seriously afflicted at being driven to take such a step  What a pity
he often said that so excellent a man should be so obstinateAnd so
shallow said somebody one day  Hold your tongue replied the King
somewhat sternly  The Archbishop was very charitable and liberal to
excess but he often granted pensions without discernment
The following is a specimen of the advantages taken of his natural
