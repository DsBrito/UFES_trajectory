a smile as he set down a black clothcovered box on the porch and
leisurely helped himself to a chair
The box looked as though it might contain a camera  Tintype fellers
thought Holt to himself and did not form a very high estimate of the
two boys neither of whom was more than sixteen years of age
Just now both boys were dusty from long travel on foot which condition
at a merely first glance concealed the fact that both were neatly
enough even if plainly dressed
Huh was all the response Jabez Holt made to Jacks pleasant comment
Hal however not in the least discouraged by a reception that was not
wholly flattering set down a box not unlike Jacks and also something
hidden in a green cloth cover that suggested a camera tripod  Hal
helped himself to one of the two remaining chairs on the porch
of the little hotel
Takin pictures asked Jabez Holt after a pause spent in chewing at
a toothpick
Yes some of the time Jack assented  It helps out a bit when two
fellows without rich fathers take a notion to travel
I spose so grunted Jabez  He was not usually considered by his
fellowtownsmen a disagreeable fellow but a hotel keeper must always
preserve a proper balance of suspicion when dealing with strangers
and especially strangers who follow callings that do not commonly lead
to prosperity  Probably Old Man Holt as he was known remembered
a few experiences with the tribe of itinerant photographers  At any
rate he did not mean to make the mistake of being too cordial with
these young representatives of the snapshot art
Is there any business around here asked Jack after awhile
Oh theres a Main Street back uptown that has some real pretty
homes admitted the hotel keeper an some likelylookin cross
streets  Dunhaven aint an awful homely town as yell see after
youve walked about a bit
But is there any business here insisted Hal Hastings patiently
I guess maybe youre business photografters then suggested the
hotel keeper
What kinds of business are there here asked Jack
Jabez Holt cast away a muchmangled toothpick and placed another in his
mouth before he replied with a chuckle
Well I reckon about the only business here that the town is doing any
talkin about at present is one that dont want no photografters
around
And what may that business be persisted Jack
Well down to Farnums boatyard theyre putting up a craft thats
known as Pollards Folly
And why wouldnt they want that photographed demanded young Benson
Because its one of them suredeath boats they hope to sell the
Government and the United States Government dont care bout havin
its war craft secrets snapshotted replied Jabez Holt
Didnt you speak of Pollards boat demanded Jack his eyes agleam
with sudden interest
Yees admitted Mr Holt slowly  A boat thatll drown its score
of men I reckon an then lay somewhere an eat itself out with rust
A submarine boat isnt it continued Jack quickly
Yep submarine torpedo boat One of them crazy craft that men will
build against all sense of whats decent on salt water
Why Ive read about that boat Jack ran on eagerly  And from
what the newspapers said Ive gathered the idea that David Pollards
boat is going to put the United States completely ahead of all other
nations at sea
Thats the way Dave Pollard talks returned Mr Holt grimly  But
folks round Dunhaven I must say dont think over an above of him
or his boat  They
Oh bother the folks around Dunhaven broke in Jack Benson
impatiently  If the place is the best they know how to do in the way
of a town I dont care a heap about their ideas of boats  Andbut I
beg your pardon Mr Holt  My tongues running a bit ahead of my
manners I guess  So this is where that famous submarine torpedo boat
is being built  And shes a diving boat at that
Well I guess mebbe shell dive all right chuckled Jabez Holt  But
as to her comin up again I reckon the Pollard aint goin to be so
certain
Where are they building her Farnums shipyard you said
Right over yonder explained Mr Holt pointing to a high board fence
that enclosed a space down by the water front  Farnums boatyard
as thus seen was about an eighth of a mile from the little hotel and
looked as though it might be considerable of a plant
Whos in charge of the boat was Jacks next question
Well now thats a conundrum replied Jabez Holt pondering  Jake
Farnum owns the yard  Jake is a young man only a few years out of
college  He inherited the business from his father whos dead  Jake
is considered a pretty good business man though he dont know much
bout boats an cant seem to learn a heap nuther  So Jake leans on
Asa Partridge the superintendent who was also superintendent under
old man Farnum  However old man Farnums line was building sailing
yachts small schooners and once in a while a tugboat  Thats in
Asa Partridges line but he wont have nothin much to do with new
schemes like diving torpedo boats
Then hinted Jack
Im acomin on with the yarn replied Jabez Kolt patiently  Now
Dave Pollard the inventor of the boat is a powerful bright young man
on theory some folks says but he aint much use with tools in his
hands  But he an young Jake Farnum hang round watching and bossing
and they have a foreman of the gang Joshua Owen who knows he knows
most everything bout buildin any kind of boat  So barrin the
fussing of Farnum and Pollard I guess Josh Owen is the real boss of
the job since the riveters gang came an put the hull together an
went away
Then I suppose Mr Owen began Jack
Jaaabez  Jabez Holt  Come here rang a shrill feminine voice from
the interior of the hotel
Must be goin for a few minutes anyway grunted Jabez rising and
leaving the two boys  But no sooner was he out of sight than Jack
Benson turned upon his chum his eyes ablaze
Hal Hastings he effused in a low voice I had forgotten that
Dunhaven was the home of the Pollard boat  But since it is and since
were herewhy here wed better stay
Do you think we can get in on that job asked Hal dubiously
Not if we just sit around and wonder or if we go meekly and ask for
a job and turn sadly away when were refused retorted Jack Benson
with a vim that was characteristic of him  Hal my boy were simply
going to shove ourselves into jobs in that boatyard and were going
to have a whack at the whole game of building and fitting out a
submarine torpedo boat  Do you catch the idea  Were just going to
hustle ourselves into the one job that would suit us better than
anything else on earth
Bully agreed Hal wistfully  I hope you can work it
We can returned his chum spiritedly  Team work you know
Weve worked around machine shops and at other trades and we know
something about the way boats are handled  Why shouldnt we be able
to make Farnum and Pollard believe we know something that will be of
use to them
I guess the foreman is the one we want to see first of all suggested
Hal
Well well camp right down here and go at the thing almost whispered
Benson  And as this hotel is right at the water front and within
two jumps of the boatyard I guess wed better stay here until we
get settled
While the two chums were discussing the whole matter in eager low
tones a few things may be told about them that will make their present
situation clearer  Jack Benson an only son had been orphaned three
years before at the age of thirteen  With the vigor that he always
displayed he had found a home and paid for his keep and schooling
either by doing chores or by working at various occupations in his
native seaport town of Oakport  He had kept at school up to a few
months before the opening of this narrative  With marked genius for
machinery he had learned many things about the machinists trade
in odd hours in one of the local shops  He was remarkably quick at
picking up new ideas and had shown splendid though untrained talent
for making mechanical drawings
Hal Hastings of the same age had a stepmother who did not regard him
kindly  Hal too had worked at odd jobs almost fighting for his
schooling  His father under the stepmothers influence paid little
heed to his doings
For two summers both boys had done fairly well working on yachts and
other boats around Oakport  Both had learned how to handle sail craft
to run motors and small marine steam engines
During the spring just passed Hal Hastings had worked much of his
time for an Oakport photographer who at the beginning of summer had
failed  Hal with a considerable bill for unpaid services had taken
some photographing material in settlement of his dues
At the beginning of summer both boys decided that Oakport did not offer
sufficient opportunity for their ambitious hopes in life  So they had
determined to take Hals newly acquired camera outfit and tramp it
from town to town earning their living by photographing and all the
while keeping their eyes open for real chances in life  Both had some
money carefully saved and hidden from the previous summers work so
that in point of attire they presented a creditable appearance
During these few weeks of tramping from place to place they had made
somewhat more money than their expenses had amounted to  Jack Benson
who was the treasurer carried their entire hoard in a roll of one and
twodollar bills
I tell you Hal Hastings Jack now wound up this submarine torpedo
boat business is already a great field  Its going to be bigger and
bigger for a lot of inventors are at work  If we can hustle our way
into this Dunhaven boatyard we may be able to
Earn a very good living I guess nodded Hal thoughtfully
Earn a living sniffed Jack rather scornfully  Hal Ive got faith
enough in both of us to believe that we could make our fortunes in a
few years  Look at some of the poor young men who had sense enough to
get into the automobile business early   The prizes go to the fellows
who get into a field early and have ability enough to build up
reputations
Jabez Holt came out upon the porch at this moment
Still here he asked looking at the boys
Were going to be here a little while I guess if its agreeable to
you Mr Holt Jack answered with a smile
What dye mean  I dont want no tintypes taken
We havent asked you to have any photos made Mr Holt Benson ran
on  Were just talking about becoming guests here
For twentyfour hours supplied Hal Hastings
For at least two days Jack amended
But see here explained Landlord Holt  Rates here are two dollars
a day  If ye haint got no other baggage Ill have ter look into
them camera boxes before I take em as security for board
You cant have them as security Mr Holt Jack laughed  Im going
to pay our charges two days in advance  For two persons its eight
dollars isnt it
Then young Benson carelessly produced the young partners roll of
banknotes  He quickly counted off eight dollars handing the money
to Mr Holt
Come right in an register said Landlord Holt springing up and
leading the way  The hotel sometimes prospered when yacht owners
or boat designers came this way but at any season eight dollars were
eight dollars  The boys were now in high standing with their host
When matters had been settled in the office Holt led them to the wash
room  Here the young men dusted themselves off washed polished
their own shoes donned clean collars and cuffs and altogether
speedily made themselves so tidy that they looked quite different
from the dusty travelers who had trudged into Dunhaven
Jabez Holt then conducted them back to chairs on the porch remarking
Its after four oclock now and supperll be ready sharp at six
What time do they knock off work in the boatyard queried Jack
Five sharp the landlord informed him
Does that foreman on the submarine boat job ever come along this way
Goes right by here on his way home Mr Holt informed the boys
Id be glad if youd introduce us to him Jack suggested
I sartain will nodded Jabez Holt  An ye know Dave Pollard is
stoppin at this hotel
Oh he is eh Jack snapped up eagerly  Then well certainly try
to make his acquaintance tonight
Hal too looked pleased at this prospect  Mrs Holt again calling
from the depths of the kitchen the landlord was forced to hurry off
He left behind two boys who suddenly fell to planning their futures
with all the rosy enthusiasm of youth  The longer they talked about
the submarine boat the more both Jack and Hal felt convinced that they
were going to succeed in getting into the work  In fact both planned
to become great in that special field
It was a bright July day one of the kind when the world looks at its
best to young hopeful minds  Absorbed in their vague but rosy plans
both boys forgot the flight of time
They were roused out of their talk at last by hearing heavy footsteps
on the gravel close at hand  Looking up they saw a heavy broad
shouldered darkcomplexioned youth of about eighteen years  He had a
swaggering way of carrying himself and undoubtedly considered himself
of much importance  His clothing proclaimed him to be a workman  As
he caught sight of the two happy looking boys this older and larger
youth looked them over with a sneering expression which soon turned to
a scowl
Strangers here aint ye demanded the scowling one as he halted on
the edge of the porch
Yes nodded Jack Benson pleasantly
Thought so vouchsafed the other  Any body but a stranger hereabouts
would know ye were in my chairthe one I sit in when I come along
this way
There was something decidedly insolent both the tone and manner of the
stranger  But Benson not quick at taking offense inquired
Are you a guest of this hotel
None of your business came the rough retort
Oh said Jack
Did ye hear me say ye were sitting in my chair
Yes
Going to get up out of it
Not until I know your rights in the matter replied Jack  You see
my board is paid in advance at this place
Huh growled the other sneeringly  Reckon ye dont know much bout
Dan Jaggerss way of doin things
Who on earth is Dan Jaggers demanded Benson curiously
Thats me  Its my name rejoined the swagger  An sense yere
so fresh
Jaggers didnt finish in words but taking a firm hold on the back of
the chair he suddenly pulled it out from under Benson  So swiftly was
the thing done that Jack went down on all fours on the porch  But
thoroughly aroused and his eyes flashing indignantly now that boy was
quickly on his feet  Dan however with a satisfied grin had dropped
into the chair
Going to get up out of that Jaggers challenged Jack Benson
Not as I know of rejoined Dan with a broader grin  Why
Because Id hate to hit you while youre sitting down replied Jack
so quietly that his voice sounded almost mild
Whats that demanded Jaggers with a guffaw of laughter
You heard what I said Jack insisted  Youd better get up
Spoiling for a fight are ye questioned the bully
Not at all Jack replied still keeping his temper in check  I never
go about looking for trouble  I suppose you didnt know any better than
to do what you did
Whats that scowled Dan Jaggers
If you want to apologize and get out of the chair Ill let it go at
that pursued Jack coolly
Hey demanded Dan Jaggers aghast  Meapologize
He sprang up suddenly resting a broad paw heavily on Jacks shoulder
But Benson without flinching or drawing back returned the ugly look
steadfastly
Youre behaving like a pretty poor grade of tough spoke Jack in deep
disgust
I am hey roared Dan  He drew back aiming a heavy fist for Bensons
chest  It was a mistake as he quickly realized for Jack Benson from
much practice in boxing was as agile and slippery as a monkey and an
eel combined  Jack dodged then came up under with a cleanly aimed
though not hard blow on Jaggerss chin
Ill learn ye roared Dan returning two ponderous blows in quick
succession  To his intense astonishment Jack wasnt in the way of
either blow but came in with a neck blow on Jaggerss left side that
sent the bully reeling to the gravel beyond the porch
Come right down here challenged the bully hoarsely  Well find out
about this
Jack Benson hesitated  He did not care about fighting  Yet seeing
that Jaggers meant to have a final encounter Jack dropped nimbly
down to the gravel
Dan Jaggers rushed at him both fists up on guard his whole attitude
more cautious since he had had a taste of the smaller youths quality
Jack was about two inches shorter and fully thirty pounds lighter but
he made one think of a dancing master as he skipped away before the big
fellows rushes
Stand still wont ye drat ye roared Dan driving in another heavy
blow
But Benson dodged then came in under the bullys guard landing a
stinging blow on the tip of his nose  Under punishment Dan let out a
noise resembling the bellow of an angry bull  Glowering he stood
uncertain for a moment but Jack was tantalizingly just out of his
reach smiling confidently  Then Jaggers leaped forward hopeful of
winding his arms around this foe and crushing him into submission
A second later however Dan fell backward yelling with pain for
Jack Benson had landed a left handed blow just under his opponents
right eye partly closing it  Dan bent over double still groaning
Well I swan said the astonished Jabez Holt in the doorway of his
hotel
Jack stood his ground a few moments watching until he felt sure that
his enemy did not intend to carry the affair further  Then the younger
boy stepped lightly back to the porch standing just before the chair
from which he had lately been evicted
Just bear in mind Ill git square with ye for this uttered Jaggers
wrathfully glaring at young Benson with his undamaged eye  Then he
turned and stalked away muttering under his breath
Well I swan remarked Jabez Holt again now stepping out onto the
porch  I guess that sartain done Dan Jaggers some good  He needs
some of that medicine friends  An say heres Josh Owen coming up
from Farnums boatyard
Jack and Hal both turned quickly to gaze down the road at a man just
coming out through the gate of Farnums yard
Hes the man we want to meet cried Jack Benson breathlessly
I dunno replied Mr Holt shaking his head ominously  I dunno
as itll do ye much good now  Dan Jaggers is Josh Owens nephew and
favorite
CHAPTER II
THE FIGHTING CHANCE
My type of torpedo boat is going to rule the seas in naval warfare
declared David Pollard his eyes akindle with the enthusiasm of the
sincere inventor
Im sure of it replied Jack Benson quietly  Thats why Mr
Pollard Hal and I are so anxious to get into this work  Mr Pollard
when your type of submarine diving torpedo boat is understood by the
United States Government youll need some reliable and intelligent
experts  Take us in now  Let us learn the work with you  Let us
go ahead keeping pace with the progress in Pollard torpedo boats
and you will never be sorry you have two young fellows you can depend
upon
Thats so if you can come near to making as good as you promise
admitted the inventor thoughtfully  But youre pretty young
And thats the only fault with the Pollard submarine boat rejoined
Jack Benson artfully  Youve got to buck your boat against all the
older types that the Government already takes an interest in  Yet you
feel sure that you can do it  You dont believe the Pollard diving
boat is too young  Give us the same show you ask for your boat
Well Ive never seen any of your workexcept these drawings
replied Mr Pollard indicating some sheets that lay on the table
before them
The chums had succeeded in making the inventors acquaintance through
the aid of the landlord  It was now eleven oclock at night  Jack and
Hal had been in the inventors room for the last three hours  Benson
had done most of the talking though Hal had now and then put in some
effective words
David Pollard was now thirty years of age tall lean and of pallid
countenance  He was a graduate of a technical school  Though not a
practical mechanic he had a rather good lot of theory stored away in
his mind  He had inherited some money soon after leaving school but
this money had vanished in inventions that he had not succeeded in
marketing  Now all his hopes in life were centered in the submarine
torpedo boat that was nearly completed  Pollard had had no money of
his own to put into the craft  Jacob Farnum was his friend and
financial backer
No one could grasp how much success with his submarine boat meant to
this wearied yet hopeful inventor  For years all his schemes had been
laughed at by practical men  It was success more than mere fortune
for which David Pollard hungered  The officials of the Navy Department
at Washington had promised to inspect and try the boat when finished
but that was all the encouragement that had come from the national
capital
If the Pollard as the new craft was at present named should prove a
failure then the inventor felt that he would be down indeed in the
world  Also he must feel that he had buried one hundred and fifty
thousand dollars of the money of his loyal friend Farnum
In his present anxious worried frame of mind with few real believers
in the possible success of his boat it was little wonder that David
Pollard was grateful for any intelligent interest or faith in his plans
These two friends were but boys nor had they had any experience in
submarine boat construction  Yet they had shown the inventor that they
knew much about machinery and marine engines in general and Jack with
his handy knack of sketching machinery had made a decided hit with
poor Pollard
Just put us in as apprentices begged Benson  Well be just the
plainest sort of helpers fetching and lifting and that sort of thing
until we learn how to do more
Well you see for one thing boys replied Pollard this building
of a submarine boat is very important and confidential work  Now
while I like the looks and talk of you both I really dont know a thing
about either of you
Of course you dont Jack Benson admitted frankly  And its highly
important that you should  I know that  But you can telegraph the
principal of the school we attended in Oakport and you can telegraph
the minister of our church too  Well abide by just what they say
about us  And here Benson brought his little roll of bills once
more into sightwell pay for the telegrams and the answers
That looks right nodded Mr Pollard with a slight smile  There
is just one more point  The superintendent of the yard Mr Partridge
isnt having anything to do with the building of the Pollard After
the steel workers and the riveters had finished on the hull then
the inside work including the fitting of the machinery was turned
over to Mr Owen our present foreman  Sometimes hes a crotchety
fellow and he might take a dislike to you youngsters
Ive got to tell you about something that I think will make him
take a dislike to us spoke up Jack Benson candidly  Then he recounted
the afternoons affair with Dan Jaggers
Yes that certainly will stir up some feeling replied Mr Pollard
In fact it will make it very difficult for you to get along with
Owen for he thinks a lot of that disagreeable bullying nephew of his
Yet Benson I like you a whole lot better for your honesty
The inventor was silent for some moments puffing slowly at a pipe and
then he removed the stem from between his teeth and continued
Youve made a good impression upon me both of you and particularly
with what you say about giving young fellows and young boats a chance
to prove themselves  You talk like youngsters with some experience and
some ideas in the matter of machinery  I admire your honesty  I also
like what you say about the need Farnum and I will have in the future
of young men who will understand our boats thoroughly  I dont know
what you can do until we try you out
He took a few more thoughtful pulls at his pipe and resumed See here
you come to the yard at eight oclock in the morning ready to do
anything thats wanted of you  I wont wire but Ill write tonight
to the references youve given  If we find youre not of much use
well drop you  If your references dont turn out to be unusually good
out you go  But if you make good youll have your chance  Its just
your fighting chance you understand  Ill fix the matter with Mr
Farnum
And the foreman smiled Jack wistfully
Mr Pollard looked grave as he answered
Look out not to invite any trouble with Joshua Owen and avoid trouble
with Jaggers who works in the boatfitting crew  I think we can get
over the effects of your little trouble this afternoon  And now boys
give me the addresses of your references and Ill write at once
A few moments later the chums bade the inventor good night then hurried
to their own room though not to retire at once
Well demanded Jack Benson his face radiant as he thought of their
fighting chance
It was the way you put the whole matter to Pollard replied Hal
Hastings  Jack youre a wonder with your tongue  I believe you could
talk a hole through a thick board fence
Weve got our chance anyway  And oh Hal  I believe its going to
be our real chance in life
Youll soon be as wild about the Pollard as the inventor himself
laughed Hastings goodnaturedly
It isnt going to be just the one boat Hal urged his chum seriously
Its the whole big problem of submarine warfare  Its going to be the
warfare of the future old chum  And starting this early we may
become Pollards real expertshis leading men when hes famous
successful and rich  We may even become his partners through getting
up improvements on his ideas  Hal boy we may even put through our own
design of submarine boat one of these days
Itll be huge fun anyway if we can get a chance to cruise on a
submarine boatunder water and all glowed young Hastings  Say
there must be a wonderful thrill to going down deep in the ocean
Thus they talked for another hour  It was very late when the two
turned in nor did they go to sleep at once  Yet when the halfpast
six call came in the morning both boys turned out in a jiffy  Excitement
took the place of rest with them  They breakfasted with appetite
Shortly after halfpast seven though the yard was so near Jack and
Hal set out for their first days work at boat building
The gate was open though the yard as they stepped inside had a
deserted look  The partly finished hulls of two schooners lay on the
ways down by the water front  There were half a dozen sloops in
various stages of completion  There were two houses close to the
waters edge in which as the boys afterwards learned motor boats
were built  But it was a rough shed more than twenty feet high and
at least one hundred and twenty feet long running down to the shore
that instantly caught Jack Bensons glance
Theres where they must be putting the Pollard in shape he cried
eagerly as he pointed  Both youngsters hurried toward that shed  As
they reached it the inventor came into sight around the end  He was
holloweyed though alert he looked even more worried than he had looked
the night before
Ah good morning boys was his greeting  Early on hand I see
When a fellows whole heart is set on a thing he isnt likely to lie
abed until the last moment is he Mr Pollard inquired Benson
That speech impressed the inventor most favorably  He could appreciate
enthusiasm
Come inside and Ill show you something he said producing a key and
leading the way to a door in the side of the shed
Through the long high windows of the shed an abundance of light fell
But Jack once inside the door halted looking with lips parted and
eyes wide open
Ooooh he murmured
What is it inquired the inventor curiously
The very wonder of the thing replied Benson frankly looking over
the whole length of the Pollard as she lay propped up on the sturdy
ways
Nor did that simple speech make the inventor think any less of the
boy  Though Hal Hastings remained silent for some time his fascinated
gaze rested steadily on the strangelooking outlines of the cigarshaped
bull of the boat
The outer hull was of steel plates carefully riveted into place
The entire length of the boat was about one hundred and ten feet
which in point of size placed her just about in the class of boats
of this type which are being constructed today
Near the center of the boat on the upper side was the conning tower
about nine feet in outside diameter and extending some four feet
above the sloping deck of the craft  Around the conning tower extended
a flat circular platform deck
At the bow of the boat the torpedo tube projected a short distance  At
the stern the rudder was in place and all was in readiness for placing
the propeller shaft and the propeller itself  On the floor of the
shed near the middle of this strange dangerous boat lay
miscellaneous small pieces of machinery and fittings
