For the Mirror
A gallant knight and a lady bright
Walkd by a crystal lake
The twind oaks made a grateful shade
Above the fangled brake
While the trembling leaves of aspen trees
A murmuring music make
And as they spoke round them echoes woke
To tales of love and glory
The knight was brave though of love the slave
And the dame lovd gallant story
Proudly he told deeds gentle and bold
Of warriors dead or hoary
Like babe at rest on its mothers breast
On that an island lay
So still and fair reigned Nature there
So bright the glistring spray
You might have thought the scene had been wrought
By spell of faun or fay
On the islands edge midst tangled sedge
Lay a wreath of wild flowrs blue
The broad flagleaf was their sweet relief
When the heat too fervid grew
And the willows shade a shelter made
When stormy tempests blew
And as they stood the faithful flood
Gave back evry line and trace
Of earth below and heaven above
And their own forms gallant grace
For forms more fair than that lovely pair
Neer shone on its liquid face
I would a flower from that bright bower
Some nymph would waft to me
For in my eyes a dearer prize
Than glittring gem twould be
For its changeless blue seems emblem true
Of loves own constancy
The maiden spake and no more the lake
In slumbring stillness lay
For from the side of his destind bride
The knight has passd away
In vain the maids soft words essayd
His rash pursuit to stay
He has reachd the tower and pluckd the flower
And turnd from the verdant spot
Ah hapless knight some Naiad bright
Wood thee to her coral grot
And forbids that more to touch that shore
Shall ever be thy lot
Vainly he tried to gain the side
Where knelt his ladylove
Flaggd every limb his eyes grew dim
But still the spirit strove
One effort morehe flings to shore
The flowr so dear to prove
Tis past tis past that look his last
That fond sad glance of love
The bubbling wave his farewell gave
In the moan Forget me not
DAH
The above incident occurred in the time of Edward IV
HAVER BREAD
To the Editor of the Mirror
In the MIRROR No 358 the article headed Memorable Days the writer
in that part of which the Avver Bread is treated of says it is
made of oats leavened and kneaded into a large thin round cake which
is placed upon a girdle over the fire adding that he is totally at a
loss for a definition of the word Avver that he has sometimes thought
avver means oaten which I think correct it being very likely a
corruption of the French avoine oats introduced among many others
into the Scottish language during the great intimacy which formerly
existed between France and Scotland in which latter country a great
many words were introduced from the former which are still in use such
as gabart a large boat or lighter from the French gabarre bawbee
baspiece a small copper coin vennell a lane or narrow street which
still retains its original pronunciation and meaning Enfiler la vennel
a common figurative expression for running away is still in use in
France Apropos of vennell Dr Stoddard in a Pedestrian Tour through
the Land of Cakes when a young man says he could not trace its
meaning in any language I speak from memory also made the same
observation where I was being at that time on intimate terms with the
doctor I pointed out to him its derivation from the Latin into the
French and thence probably into the Scotch the embryo LLD stared
and seemed chagrined at receiving such information from a
CREOLE
PS In no part of Great Britain I believe is oaten bread so much used
as in Scotland from whence the term The Land of Cakes is derived In
some parts of France Pain davoine has been in use in my time
EPITOME OF THE CRUSADES
For the Mirror
The first Crusade1 to the Holy Land was undertaken by numerous
Christian princes who gained Jerusalem after it had been in possession
of the Saracens four hundred and nine years Godfrey of Boulogne was
then chosen king by his companions in arms but he had not long enjoyed
his new dignity before he had occasion to march out against a great
army of Turks and Saracens whom he overthrew and killed one hundred
thousand of their men besides taking much spoil Shortly after this
victory a pestilence happened of which multitudes died and the
contagion reaching Godfrey the first Christian King of Jerusalem
he also expired on the 18th of July 1100 having scarcely reigned
a full year
Godfreys successors the Baldwins defeated the Turks in many
engagements In the reign of Baldwin III however the Christians lost
Edessa a circumstance which affected Pope Eugenius III to such a
degree that he prevailed on Conrad III Emperor of Germany to relieve
his brethren in Syria In the year 1146 therefore Conrad marched
through Greece and soon afterwards encountered the Turkish army which
he routed he then proceeded to Iconium the principal seat of the Turks
in Lesser Asia but for want of provisions and health was compelled
to relinquish his design of taking that city and to return home Much
about the same period Lewis VIII of France made an expedition to
the Holy Land but was wholly unsuccessful in his attempts against the
enemy Notwithstanding these failures King Baldwin relying on his
own strength gained possession of Askalon and defeated the Turks in
numerous actions Previous to his death which was caused by poison
in 1163 he was the victorious sovereign of Jerusalem and the greatest
part of Syria
During the reign of Baldwin IV Saladin Sultan of Egypt invaded
Palestine and took several towns notwithstanding the valour of
the Christians In the succeeding reign of King Guy however the
Christians still unfortunate received a decisive blow which
tended to the decline of their independence in the Holy Land for among
other places of importance Saladin made a capture of Jerusalem and
took its king prisoner When the conqueror entered the holy city he
profaned every sacred place save the Temple of the Sepulchre which
the Christians redeemed with an immense sum of money and drove the
Latin Christians from their abodes who were only allowed to carry what
they could hastily collect on their backs either to Tripoly Antioch
or Tyre the only three places which then remained in the Christians
possession All the monuments were demolished except those of our
Saviour King Godfrey and Baldwin I2 The city was yielded to the
captors on the 2nd of October 1187 after the Christians had possessed
it about eightynine years
These calamitous transactions in Palestine greatly alarmed all Europe
and several princes speedily resolved to oppose the career of the
oppressors and to leave no means untried of regaining the kingdom of
Jerusalem In furtherance of this design the Emperor Frederic marched
into Palestine with a powerful army and defeated the Turks near
Melitena he afterwards met them near Comogena where he also routed
them but was unhappily killed in the action Some time after this
King Philip of France and Richard I of England engaged in a crusade
for the relief of the Christians Philip arrived first and proceeded
to Ptolemais which King Guy having obtained his liberty was then
besieging King Richard in his passage was driven with his fleet upon
the coast of Cyprus but was not permitted to land this so highly
offended him that he landed his whole army by force and soon overran
the island He was at length opposed by the king of Cyprus whom he took
prisoner and carried in chains to Ptolemais where he was welcomed with
great rejoicings by the besiegers who stood in much need of assistance
It would he superfluous to relate here the particulars of the siege let
it suffice to say that after a general assault had been given a breach
was made so that the assailants were enabled to enter the city which
Saladin surrendered to them upon articles on the 12th of July 1191
King Richard here obtained the title of Coeur de Lion for having
taken down Duke Leopolds standard that was first fixed in the breach
and placed his own in its stead
After the taking of Ptolemais King Philip and many other princes
returned home leaving King Richard in Palestine to prosecute the war in
concert with Guy whom Richard in a short time afterwards persuaded to
accept of the crown of Cyprus in lieu of his pretences to Jerusalem
By these crafty means Richard caused himself to be proclaimed King of
Jerusalem but while he was preparing to besiege that city he received
news that the French were about to invade England He was therefore
compelled to conclude a peace with Saladin not very advantageous to
Christendom and to return to Europe But meeting with bad weather he
was driven on the coast of Histria and while endeavouring to travel
through the country in the habit of a templar was taken prisoner
by Duke Leopold of Austria who became his enemy at the siege of
Ptolemais The duke sold him for forty thousand pounds to the emperor
Henry VI who soon afterwards had a hundred thousand pounds for his
ransom
About the same period Sultan Saladin the most formidable enemy the
Christians ever encountered died an event which caused Pope Celestine
to prevail on the emperor Henry VI of Germany to make a new
expedition against the Turks who were in consequence defeated but
the emperors general the Duke of Saxony being killed and the
emperor himself dying soon afterwards the Germans returned home
without accomplishing the object of their expedition They had no sooner
departed than the Turks in revenge nearly drove the Christians from
the Holy Land and took all the strong towns which the Crusaders had
gained excepting Tyre and Ptolemais In 1199 a fleet was fitted out
at the instigation of Pope Innocent III against the infidels On this
occasion the Christians notwithstanding their strenuous exertions
failed of taking Jerusalem though several other important places were
delivered to them
In the year 1228 Frederic Emperor of Germany set out from Brundusium
to Palestine took Jerusalem which the enemy had left in a desolate
condition and caused himself to be proclaimed king But after this
conquest he was obliged to return to his own country where his
presence was required The Turks immediately assembled a prodigious army
for regaining the Holy City which they ultimately took putting the
German garrison to the sword in the year 1234 since which time the
Christian powers weary of these useless expeditions have made no
considerable effort to possess it
The Christians were entirely driven from Palestine and Syria in the year
1291 about one hundred and ninetytwo years after the capture of
Jerusalem by Godfrey of Boulogne

ANECDOTES OF A DIANA MONKEY

the Diana species He had been purchased by the cook of the vessel in
