1 Waiting
Two thousand years ago in the land of Palestine the Jewish people
were waiting for something to happenor really were waiting for
someone to come
When will he come was the question they were always asking one
another Will he come in five years next year Or is he already on
his way
They were waiting for someone and when he came they would call him
the Messiah If they spoke the Greek language they would call him
Christ The people thought he would be a great king
They had one king already His name was Herod the Great But Herod was
not the kind of king they wanted Herod was hard and cruel He
poisoned and beheaded those who made him angry He was not a Jew by
birth The Messiah when he came would be a good king He would be
a Jew himself and a friend to all the Jewish people One of the
prophets said he would be like the shepherds of Palestine who watched
their sheep night and day and carried the small lambs in their arms
But the most important thing about the Messiah was that he would drive
Caesar and his armies out of the country Caesar How they hated his
very name For Caesar was the emperor of the Romans Some years
before the Romans had occupied the country and begun to rule it
Herod was still king of the Jews but now he took his orders from
Caesar Everybody had to take orders from Caesar The Jews were not a
free people any more
It used to be so different the older people sighed before the
Romans came
Everywhere in Palestine Roman armies went marching Their shields
flashed in the sunlight and when they were on the march they carried
golden eagles which stood for Caesars power
The Romans tried to rule the country well They said that everybody
would get justice and fair play But the Jews could not see the
fairness in having to pay taxes to a foreign king who did not even
worship God They did not like to see Roman soldiers whipping people
with long leather whips called scourges into which bits of glass and
lead and iron were fastened to make them bite more deeply into some
poor Jews back They were sick at heart when the Romans began to
punish criminals by nailing them up by their hands and feet to big
wooden crosses and leaving them to hang there until they died
Illustration
Well the Messiah would take care of the Romans He would gather an
army from east and west and north and south Then there would be a
great day for the Jewish people a great day for the nation that was
called by the glorious name of Israel From all over the country the
men of Israel would rise up They would come when their king called
them and he would lead them to victory against Caesar The Romans
would go back where they came from and Israel would be free and
peaceful and rich and happy again The Messiah would make Israel into
a great kingdom bigger and more powerful than the Roman Empire ever
was The Jews would rule the world Everyone everywhere would
worship the God of Israel and the Messiah would be King of all the
nations of the earth If only he would come
Illustration
It was hard to wait so long They had waited for him a long time and
their fathers and grandfathers had waited for him too Sometimes word
would go around that he had finally arrived and in great excitement
some of the Jews would get ready to drive the Romans out of Palestine
But always it turned out to be a mistake and the Jews would be
disappointed and shake their heads and say Will he ever come
But when they grew discouraged they would remember what was written
in their Holy Scriptures For it was surely written there that the
Messiah would come someday There could be no mistake about it
Someday he would come
Illustration
And so it went on month after month year after year The people
worked and dreamed and hoped and prayed The rains would fall in
October and soften the hard dry ground after the heat of summer so
that the farmer could do his plowing And as he plowed the land the
farmer thought about the Messiah and wondered if he would come before
the harvest in the spring Then spring would come and the wheat and
barley would be growing up in the smiling fields and all down the
hillside the grapevines and the olive trees would be full of fruit
The Romans were still marching through the country and still there
was no Messiah But the farmer thought that maybe he would come before
the next fall rains
The fisherman would go sailing across the deepblue Sea of Galilee
and while he waited for the fish to come into his net he thought of
how long Israel had waited for the Messiah to come The beggars in the
city streets who were deaf or blind or crippled would sit at the
corners and ask for money to buy food They were wondering too if the
Messiah would ever come and help the poor folk of Israel
The shepherds out on the rocky hills where nothing would grow but
grass for sheep and goats and cattle were also thinking of the
Messiah In good weather and bad they were there keeping an eye on
their sheep and they had plenty of time to think When the rain and
the snow were in their faces the shepherds were thinking When will
he come And when the hot sun climbed overhead and the heat was
like a furnace or when the east wind came and blew dust in their
faces then too the shepherds thought When will he come and save
us
Illustration
Farmers fishermen shepherdsthese were not the only people who were
thinking of the Messiah Sometimes along the hot lonely roads of
Palestine where robbers and wild animals were hiding a traveler
would have dreams Or the dream might come to someone in sunny
Galilee where camel caravans crossed with their loads of spices and
jewels and precious things from Far Eastern lands But it was most
likely to come to a man when he was standing in the great white
gleaming Temple at Jerusalem where all good Jews went to worship God
And the dream would be that the sky opened and a great light blazed
down from heaven An army came marching down out of the sky led by a
shining warrior whose face was bright as lightning From his eyes shot
flames of fire His arms and feet shone like polished brass or gold
and when he spoke his voice was like the shouting of ten thousand men
It was King Messiah Destroy the Romans he would cry Burn up
their armies Let not a single one escape Fire would pour down from
the skies when he gave the order and the Romans would melt away to
nothing as though they had never been
Illustration
Illustration
Then the dream would fade away The dreamer would just be trudging
along the dusty road or watching the camel caravans go by or
standing in the Temple with the crowds of unhappy people pushing all
around him
It was just a dream The Romans were still there There was no Messiah
anywhere to be seen
If only the King would come

2 A King Is Born
Nobody saw the lions in the daytime for they were sleeping in their
caves But at night they might come out to prowl around the rocky
hills looking for a fat sheep to eat After dark the hyenas and
jackals began to howl Robbers might be somewhere in the darkness too
In the night when other folk were fast asleep a good shepherd needed
to be awake and on the watch to see that no harm came to his sheep
and lambs
One night when winter was in the air some shepherds were huddled
together on a stony field not far from the town of Bethlehem Not many
miles to the north lay Jerusalem the capital city of Palestine But
here in the fields it was quiet and lonely and cold
The shepherds sat upon the rocks or stood leaning upon their staves
Now and again one of them would see something move or hear a little
rustling sound He would raise his eyes and peer out anxiously into
the darkness to make sure that all was well
Suddenly without any warning the sky was flooded with light from
beyond the clouds Everything had been dark a minute before but now
every stone and tree and hillock in the field showed up bright as day
The shepherds jumped to their feet Some were too frightened to speak
and others cried out in terror
What is it
What can it be
Its the glory of the Lord one called out Lord have mercy upon
us
Suddenly they heard a loud clear voice
Shepherds
Silence fell upon the group
Shepherds do not be afraid I bring you the good news which all the
Jews have waited so long to hear This very day Christ your Saviour
has been born in the city of David And this is how you will know him
you will find him as a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying
in a manger
Illustration
The voice broke off and a great chorus began to sing The sky rang
with the music and these were the words of the song
Glory to God in the highest
And on earth peace good will toward men
As quickly as they had come the light and the singing were gone
There was just the darkness again and the faroff howling of wild
beasts Everything was the same as before except that the shepherds
eyes were still blinded by the light and their ears were full of the
music
Illustration
Their excited voices broke the spell as they all talked at once
Hes come at lastthe Messiahs come
Where did the angel say
The city of Davidthat means Bethlehem
Why are we waiting here Lets go to Bethlehem
Yes lets go to Bethlehem at once and find out what has happened
there
For the first time in their lives the shepherds left their sheep to
look after themselves Across the hills and the stone fences and the
rocky fields the shepherds scrambled and hardly stopped for breath
till they reached the edge of the town Everything in Bethlehem was
dark as night can be But nonot everything One tiny speck of light
was flickering in the blackness
He must be where the light is said one of the shepherds
Down the street they ran and in through a door
They were standing in a stable There were no angels there Instead of
that the shepherds saw cows and donkeys eating hay A cold draft of
air was blowing in around the cracks of the door and over the dirt
floor Beside one of the mangers they saw a man standing A young
woman was resting close by She was watching a baby who lay in the
straw
We came to see the Messiah one of the shepherds stammered
The baby cried The animals munched their food
There was some explaining to do The shepherds told the story of what
had happened in the field
The young man beside the manger did not have anything very exciting to
tell the shepherds
My name he said is Joseph This is my wife Mary We used to live
here in Bethlehem but no one remembers us now Ive been working in
Galilee for years I have a carpenter shop there The only reason we
came back to Bethlehem was to have our names entered in the government
records
We got here only yesterday We tried to get a room in the inn but
there wasnt any room for us with all the important people here They
said we could sleep in the stable The baby came tonight Here he is
if you would like to see him
The shepherds looked at the baby They hoped that they would see
something unusual about him but he looked just like any other baby
Then they remembered the angels song
Outside again the shepherds looked up and saw a faint gray light
streaking the blackness in the east Morning was coming Soon the
people of the countryside would be getting up
What a story the shepherds were going to tell them Who would have
thought of looking for the Messiah in a manger The shepherds were the
first to learn the secret As they walked back to their flocks they
prayed and gave thanks to God
Illustration
Meanwhile the little family in the stable were gathered in silence
around the manger Mary the mother said never a word but her
thoughts were busy with the tale the shepherds had told about her
little child
The shepherds were not the only people to see strange lights in the
sky Many miles away three men saw a new star They were Wise Men
and they knew all the stars but this one they had never seen before
It was not only a new star but a moving star Like a bright fingertip
in the heavens it seemed to beckon them on The Wise Men were rich
and important and thought nothing of a journey At once they made
ready and set out to see where the star would lead them For many days
they traveled across the desert and at last they came to Jerusalem
Although they were not Jews they had heard that a Messiah was
expected someday in Palestine When they saw that the star had brought
them to Jerusalem they decided that the Messiah must have come
We are strangers here they said to each other We had better ask
our way
King Herod was in Jerusalem just then and the Wise Men went to his
palace Since they were rich and famous they had no trouble getting
in to see the king
They bowed down respectfully before the king and Herod received them
with courtesy Then the Wise Men asked
Illustration
Where is the newborn King of the Jews We have seen his star in the
east We have come to worship him but we do not know where he is
Herod was surprised and then he was angry A new king of the Jews
Why Herod himself was the king of the Jews However he hid his
feelings and answered
I will find out what you want to know
He left the Wise Men and hurried off to consult with his advisers
The Messiah he shouted Where do they say the Messiah will be
born
Solemnly he was told
In Bethlehem An ancient book of the Holy Scriptures tells us that
out of Bethlehem shall come a governor to rule the people of Israel
Fear and jealousy boiled up in Herod But a king must control his
feelings and Herod was old and wise When he had called his three
visitors to him he was as smooth and polite as ever He told them
that they would find the child in Bethlehem
Go there Herod said and look for him carefully And when you have
found him come and tell me for I too want to go and worship him
The Wise Men thanked the king and set out for Bethlehem Soon they
arrived at the place where Joseph and Mary were staying with the baby
It was very different from Herods palace
There the three Wise Men fell down on their knees as they would before
a king They opened their treasures and put their gifts in front of
the baby One brought gold The others brought sweetsmelling
ointments frankincense and myrrh
Hail Messiah they murmured in adoration Hail Christ Hail King
of the Jews
When they were once more outside on the road one of them spoke
I think he said that it would be well for us not to see anything
of Herod again I had a dream
The others agreed with him quickly They had had a dream too
God sent that dream to warn us that Herod is dangerous they said
Herod means to harm the child Let us find some other road back
home

The days went by and soon the baby was given his name He was to be
called Jesus
One day when Jesus was about six weeks old Joseph said to Mary
Now that we have a child we must go up to the Temple in Jerusalem
and give an offering to the Lord We cannot afford a lamb But we can
at least take pigeons or a pair of turtledoves
So Joseph and Mary left Bethlehem and carried Jesus with them to
Jerusalem five miles away
An old man came up to them in the Temple
My name is Simeon he said I have been waiting for you a long
time All my life I have been waiting to see the Messiah And now the
day has come
He took Jesus from his mothers arms and as he held the baby he began
to pray
Lord let me now die in peace he prayed For I have seen the
Messiah the Saviour of all nations and the glory of the Jewish
people
Simeon turned back to Joseph and Mary who were looking at him in
wonder
Mary he said this child of yours is going to break your heart He
will make enemies and cause great trouble in this country He will
suffer and others will suffer too because of him But also he will
give joy and bring many people to God God bless you now
With these words the old man handed the baby back to Mary and turned
away Joseph and Mary never saw him again but they remembered his
words forever after
They took Jesus and started on their walk back to Bethlehem There
was so much for them to think about
First there was the story of the shepherds Then the Wise Men had come
with their wonderful gifts And now there was this old man with his
strange words of blessing and warning
Everything seemed to tell them that Jesus was the Messiah They
should be happier than anyone in the world And yet they were not
happy There was trouble in the air Their baby was going to be King
of the Jews Why should there be any trouble about it They could not
understand
Trouble was not long in coming One night Joseph had a dream When he
awoke he called to his wife and told her that they must leave
Bethlehem at once God had sent the dream as a warning for them to get
out of the country They did not dare to stay there any longer So
Joseph and Mary packed up their belongings and set out for the far
country of Egypt where they would be safe
They left Bethlehem none too soon For Herod was exceedingly angry
when the Wise Men did not come back Now he was sure that the Messiah
really had been born He was afraid that soon there would be a new
king in Palestine to take his throne away from him
When Herod was afraid he never wasted any time Somewhere in
Bethlehem was a child whom he feared and somehow that child must be
killed But he did not know which child it was How could he be sure
to find the right one He thought of a simple plan
He called his army officers together and gave them their orders
Send your soldiers to Bethlehem he told them and have them kill
every boy in the place who is two years old or younger
The officers sent their men to Bethlehem and all the little boys they
could find there were put to death No matter who they were they had
to die It did not take the soldiers very long
In a few hours they were back in Jerusalem Herod breathed more
easily
Thats a good thing he thought If every little boy in Bethlehem
is dead the Messiah must be dead along with the rest
Herod did not know that the baby whom he feared was gone from
Bethlehem before the soldiers got there While the fathers and mothers
of Bethlehem were crying because their little ones were dead Joseph
and Mary and Jesus were safely on their way to Egypt
Herod did not live long enough to find out his mistake After he died
the little family in Egypt learned that it was safe to go home again
But this time they did not go back to Bethlehem They went straight to
the town of Nazareth in Galilee where Joseph had worked before Jesus
was born There they settled down as though nothing unusual had
happened
In Galilee nobody knew that anything strange had happened at all
Nobody there had heard of the shepherds and the Wise Men and nobody
knew what Simeon had said in the Temple Nobody knew why it was that
so many babies in Bethlehem had been murdered Nobody in Nazareth
thought that the Messiah had come
Illustration
In Nazareth people only said I hear the carpenter has a son When
Jesus began to walk perhaps they said Josephs son is strong for his
age And later they said The carpenters lad is doing well at
school
But there were more interesting things to talk about in Nazareth than
the carpenters family There was the Messiah to talk about When
will he come the people asked each other
Nobody in Nazareth had heard the angels sing
Illustration
3 Growing
When boys in Nazareth were about six years old it was time for them
to go to school No girls were there for the girls stayed home with
their mothers But every day except the Sabbath the boys went to the
school and sat on the floor with their legs crossed and there the
teacher taught them many things that every Jewish boy would need to
know
He taught them their A B Cs in the Hebrew language Instead of A he
showed them how to make a mark like this Hebrew a Instead of B
they learned to make this letter Hebrew b and so on through all
the alphabet Then when they knew their letters they could learn to
read And every Jewish boy had first of all to read the Scriptures
The teacher taught them what was in the Scriptures Over and over they
said their lessons aloud talking all at once until they knew
everything they were supposed to know by heart
The teacher taught them psalms which had been sung for many years in
the Temple of Jerusalem
He taught them also about the prophets The prophets were preachers
whose words had long ago been written down in the sacred Scriptures
These books were long pieces of skin which were kept rolled up when
no one was reading them There were many prophetsIsaiah Jeremiah
Ezekiel Amos Malachi and many others Little by little the boys
began to discover what these preachers had said
Illustration
The teacher also made sure that they knew about that part of the
Scriptures called the Law The Ten Commandments were in the Law and
many other sayings which told people what they must do and what they
must not do in order to please God The boys learned how God gave the
Commandments to Moses while lightning flashed and thunder crashed
at the faroff mountain of Sinai
The teacher told them stories of all that had happened to the Jewish
people in the years gone by But the most important was the story of
the Passover This story explained why their parents went to Jerusalem
each spring
Now this was what every Jewish boy had to learn about the Passover
and remember always
Once there was a time hundreds of years before when the Jews did not
live in Palestine They lived in Egypt where they were slaves They
wanted to escape so that they might have a country of their own where
they could be free
One spring night God sent a disease into Egypt and thousands died of
it There was not an Egyptian home where the oldest child in the
family did not die But none of the Jews died Therefore they said
that God passed over their doors that night
Then there was a great uproar and clamor in Egypt with the Egyptians
weeping and nursing their sick and burying their dead The time had
come for the Jews to get away Under their leader Moses they began
their long journey toward Palestine
The Jewish people never forgot what God did for them in Egypt So in
the spring of each year was held the Feast of the Passover to give
thanks to God for the help he had given them long ago They gathered
together and sang
Illustration
O give thanks unto the Lord for he is good For his mercy
endureth for ever
To the Passover feast every family brought a lamb to be killed as a
sacrifice to God Only the best could be given to God They chose a
lamb that was white and pure and fine and precious Then they
roasted the lamb and ate it What a feast they had so solemn and so
joyful as they remembered all that God had done
Everyone knew the best place to hold the Passover feast was at
Jerusalem Therefore every year when spring came round the people
said to one another It is Passover time and as many as could leave
their homes went up to the great city
When the boys heard the story they understood why their parents went
there in the spring
When Jewish boys were twelve years old and could read the Hebrew
language and knew the psalms and understood the prophets and were
learning to obey the Lawthen they were practically grown up At this
age a boy could be called a son of the Law He could go along with
his parents to Jerusalem when it was Passover time
Each year Joseph and Mary liked to be in Jerusalem for the Passover
When Jesus was twelve years old he was a son of the Law like other
boys his age and for the first time he went with them Many friends
and relatives kept them company as they started on the road
Now from Nazareth it was more than eighty miles to Jerusalem and
eighty miles is a long way to walk
It would have been easier to ride in a cart but nobody traveled that
way in Palestine The roads were too rough and narrow for anything but
walking Donkeys and horses might carry the heavy luggage but the
people went on foot There were no bridges and so the only way to get
from one side of a river to the other was to find a shallow place and
wade across
It would take two or three days to go from Nazareth to Jerusalem When
the travelers were tired at night there was not likely to be any
place to sleep along the road except under the open sky and the
stars
There were three stages to their journey The first was the pleasant
part through Galilee When the travelers left Nazareth that day the
sky was clear and the air was fresh The fields lay lovely in the
sunlight The roads were full of people from many countries There
were always merchants on the road traveling from the East to Greece
and Egypt and back to the East again Galilee was beautiful and
Galilee was busy
Sooner or later the time must come to leave pleasant Galilee behind
But which way would they go from there Should they go straight south
through Samaria That would have been the shortest and the easiest
way The only thing against it was that the people of Samaria were not
friendly to Jews Long years before Samaria had been the home of many
of the Jewish people But foreigners came and settled among them Then
their ways became so different that the people of Jerusalem said they
were not Jewish any more They were bitter rivals of the Jews and it
was hardly safe to go among them
So the travelers chose for the second stage of their journey the
long road down the valley of the river Jordan But they did not find
this very pleasant either High above the river stood the banks and
it seemed as though the river itself were at the bottom of a great
deep ditch And down there was the road they had to take In some
places they came to slime and mud and dead trees and twisted roots
But sometimes there were farms and villages It was hot at the north
end of the Jordan when first they came to it and the farther south
the travelers went the hotter grew the weather
Very hot very tired and very thirsty they finally reached the last
stretch of the journeyacross country from the Jordan to Jerusalem
They were nearly there But the last part of the trip was the hardest
of all Around them stretched a dreary desert There were bleak hills
and ugly rocks and hardly a drop of water anywhere to drink No
wonder nobody went to Jerusalem except Jews and Roman soldiers There
were no gay caravans of Eastern merchants here Galilee seemed very
far away
Up one side of a hill and down another and then another higher hill
to climb Up and up over stones and bare earth and bushes and thorns
until they were high above the Jordanthat was the road to Jerusalem
Would they ever get there What they would have given just to sit down
and wash the sand off their hot tired feet
Then all at once they saw it From the top of the hill they saw it
walls and roofs and towers gleaming in the morning sun A shout of joy
went up Every man and woman and child joined in the shouting
Jerusalem the city of David King David built that city a thousand
years ago The enemies of God had come and burned it to the ground
but the Jews built it up again They were sure that it could never be
destroyed It would always be there for ever and ever Someday the
Messiah would come and all the peoples and nations of the world
would come to see Jerusalem as these poor folk from Galilee were
doing now
