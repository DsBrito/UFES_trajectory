They have always had a high activity count sir Neel put in
hopefully
High yes but always negative Until now Now it is slightly positive
and nothing we can do seems to change it Thats why Ive called you in
I want you to run a new basic survey ignoring the old one still in
operation to reexamine the check points on our graphs The trouble
may lie there
Neel thought before he answered picking his words carefully Wouldnt
that be a little  unethical sir After all Hengly who is operator
there now is a friend of mine Going behind his back you know
I know nothing of the sort Abravanel snorted We are not playing for
poker chips or seeing who can get a paper published first Have you
forgotten what Societics is
Neel answered by rote The applied study of the interaction of
individuals in a culture the interaction of the group generated by
these individuals the equations derived therefrom and the application
of these equations to control one or more factors of this same culture
And what is the one factor that we have tried to control in order to
make all the other factors possible of existence
War Neel said in a very small voice
Very good then there is no doubt what it is we are talking about You
are going to land quietly on Himmel do a survey as quickly as possible
and transmit the data back here There is no cause to think of it as
sneaking behind Henglys back but as doing something to help him set
the matter right Is that understood
Yes sir Neel said firmly this time straightening his back and
letting his right hand rest reassuringly on the computer slung from his
belt
Excellent Then it is now time to meet your assistant Abravanel
touched a button on his desk
It was an unexpected development and Neel waited with interest as the
door opened But he turned away abruptly his eyes slitted and his face
white with anger Abravanel introduced them
Neel Sidorak this is
Costa I know him He was in my class for six months There wasnt the
slightest touch of friendliness in Neels voice now Abravanel either
ignored it or didnt hear it He went on as if the two cold distant
young men were the best of friends
Classmates Very goodthen there is no need to make introductions
Though it might be best to make clear your separate areas of control
This is your project Neel and Adao Costa will be your assistant
following your orders and doing whatever he can to help You know he
isnt a graduate Societist but he has done a lot of field work for us
and can help you greatly in that And of course he will be acting as
an observer for the UN and making his own reports in this connection
Neels anger was hot and apparent So hes a UN observer now I wonder
if he still holds his old job at the same time I think it only fair
sir that you know He works for Interpol
Abravanels ancient and weary eyes looked at both men and he sighed
Wait outside Costa he said Neel will be with you in a minute
Costa left without a word and Abravanel waved Neel back to his chair
Listen to me now he said and stop playing tunes on that infernal
buzzer Neel snapped his hand away from the belt computer as if it had
suddenly grown hot A hesitant finger reached out to clear the figures
he had nervously been setting up then thought better of it Abravanel
sucked life into his ancient pipe and squinted at the younger man
Listen he said You have led a very sheltered life here at the
university and that is probably my fault No dont look angry I dont
mean about girls In that matter undergraduates have been the same for
centuries Im talking about people in groups individuals politics
and all the complicated mess that makes up human life This has been
your area of study and the program is carefully planned so you can study
it secondhand The important thing is to develop the abstract viewpoint
since any attempt to prejudge results can only mean disaster And it has
been proved many times that a man with a certain interest will make many
unwitting errors to shape an observation or experiment in favor of his
interest No we could have none of that here
We are following the proper study of mankind and we must do that by
keeping personally on the outside to preserve our perspective When you
understand that you understand many small things about the university
Why we give only resident student scholarships at a young age and why
the outoftheway location here in the Dolomites You will also see the
reason why the campus bookstore stocks all of the books published but
never has an adequate supply of newspapers The agreed policy has been
to see that you all mature with the long view Thenhopefullyyou will
be immune to shortterm political interests after you leave
This policy has worked well in turning out men with the correct
attitude towards their work It has also turned out a fair number of
selfcentered egocentric horrors
Neel flushed Do you mean that I
No I dont mean you If I did I would say so Your worst faultif
you can call it a fault since it is the very thing we have been trying
to bring aboutis that you have a very provincial attitude towards the
universe Now is the time to reexamine some of those ideas Firstly
what do you think the attitude of the UN is towards Societics
There was no easy answer Neel could see traps ready for anything he
said His words were hesitant I cant say Ive really ever thought
about it I imagine the UN would be in favor of it since we make their
job of world government that much easier
No such thing Abravanel said tempering the sharpness of his words
with a smile To put it in the simplest language they hate our guts
They wish I had never formulated Societics and at the same time they
are very glad I did They are in the position of the man who caught the
tiger by the tail The man enjoys watching the tiger eat all of his
enemies but as each one is consumed his worry grows greater What will
happen when the last one is gone Will the tiger then turn and eat him
Wellwe are the UNs tiger Societics came along just at the time it
was sorely needed Earth had settled a number of planets and governed
them First as outposts then as colonies The most advanced planets
very quickly outgrew the colony stage and flexed their independent
muscles The UN had no particular desire to rule an empire but at the
same time they had to insure Earths safety I imagine they were
considering all sorts of schemesincluding outright military
controlwhen they came to me
Even in its early crude form Societics provided a stopgap that would
give them some breathing time They saw to it that my work was well
endowed and aided meunofficially of coursein setting up the first
control experiments on different planets We had results some very
good and the others not so bad that the local police couldnt get
things back under control after a while I was of course happy to
perfect my theories in practice After a hundred years I had all the
rough spots evened down and we were in business The UN has never come
up with a workable alternative plan so they have settled down to the
uncomfortable business of holding the tigers tail They worry and spend
vast sums of money keeping an eye on our work
But why Neel broke in
Why Abravanel gave a quick smile Thank you for fine character
rating I imagine it is inconceivable to you that I might want to be
Emperor of the Universe I could be you know The same forces that hold
the lids on the planets could just as easily blow them off
Neel was speechless at the awful enormity of the thought Abravanel rose
from behind his desk with an effort and shambled over to lay a thin and
featherlight arm on the younger mans shoulders Those are the facts
of life my boy And since we cannot escape them we must live with them
Costa is just a man doing his duty So try and put up with him For my
sake if not for your own
Of course Neel agreed quickly The whole thing takes a bit of
getting used to but I think I can manage Well do as good a job on
Himmel as it is possible to do Dont worry about me sir
Costa was waiting in the next room puffing quietly on a long cigarette
They left together walking down the hall in silence Neel glanced
sideways at the wiry darkskinned Brazilian and wondered what he could
say to smooth things out He still had his reservations about Costa but
hed keep them to himself now Abravanel had ordered peace between them
and what the old man said was the law
It was Costa who spoke first Can you brief me on Himmelwhat well
find there and be expected to do
Run the basic survey first of course Neel told him Chances are
that that will be enough to straighten things out Since the completion
last year of the refining equations of Debirs Postulate all sigma110
and alpha142 graph points are suspect
Just stop there please and run the flag back down the pole Costa
interrupted I had a sixmonths survey of Societics seven years ago to
give me a general idea of the field Ive worked with survey teams since
then but I have only the vaguest idea of the application of the
information we got Could you cover the ground againonly a bit
slower
Neel controlled his anger successfully and started again in his best
classroom manner
Well Im sure you realize that a good survey is half the problem It
must be impartial and exact If it is accurately done application of
the kfactor equations is almost mechanical
Youve lost me again Everyone always talks about the kfactor but no
one has ever explained just what it is
Neel was warming to his topic now Its a term borrowed from
nucleonics and best understood in that context Look you know how an
atomic pile worksessentially just like an atomic bomb The difference
is just a matter of degree and control In both of them you have
neutrons tearing around some of them hitting nuclei and starting new
neutrons going These in turn hit and start others This goes on faster
and faster and bam a few milliseconds later you have an atomic bomb
This is what happens if you dont attempt to control the reaction
However if you have something like heavy water or graphite that will
slow down neutrons and an absorber like cadmium you can alter the speed
of the reaction Too much damping material will absorb too many neutrons
and the reaction will stop Not enough and the reaction will build up to
an explosion Neither of these extremes is wanted in an atomic pile
What is needed is a happy balance where you are soaking up just as many
neutrons as are being generated all the time This will give you a
constant temperature inside the reactor The net neutron reproduction
constant is then 1 This balance of neutron generation and absorption is
the kfactor of the reactor Ideally 10000000
Thats the ideal though the impossible to attain in a dynamic system
like a reactor All you need is a few more neutrons around giving you a
kfactor of 100000001 and you are headed for trouble Each extra
neutron produces two and your production rate soars geometrically
towards bang On the other hand a kfactor of 0999999999 is just as
bad Your reaction is spiraling down in the other direction To control
a pile you watch your kfactor and make constant adjustments
All this I follow Costa said but wheres the connection with
Societics
Well get to thatjust as soon as you realize and admit that a minute
difference of degree can produce a marked difference of kind You might
say that a single impossibly tiny neutron is the difference between an
atom bomb and a slowly cooling pile of inert uranium isotopes Does that
make sense
Im staggering but still with you
Good Then try to go along with the analogy that a human society is
like an atomic pile At one extreme you will have a dying decadent
culturethe remains of a highly mechanized societyliving off its
capital using up resources it cant replace because of a lost
technology When the last machine breaks and the final food synthesizer
collapses the people will die This is the cooled down atomic pile At
the other extreme is complete and violent anarchy Every man thinking
only of himself killing and destroying anything that gets in his
waythe atomic explosion Midway between the two is a vital active
producing society
This is a generalizationand you must look at it that way In reality
society is infinitely complex and the ramifications and possibilities
are endless It can do a lot more things than fizzle or go boom
Pressure of population war or persecution patterns can cause waves of
immigration Plant and animal species can be wiped out by momentary
needs or fashions Remember the fate of the passenger pigeon and the
American bison
All the pressures crossrelationships hungers needs hatreds
desires of people are reflected in their interrelationships One man
standing by himself tells us nothing But as soon as he says something
passes on information in an altered form or merely expresses an
attitudehe becomes a reference point He can be marked measured and
entered on a graph His actions can be grouped with others and the
action of the group measured Manand his societythen becomes a
systems problem that can be fed into a computer Weve cut the Gordian
knot of the threeLs and are on our way towards a solution
Stop Costa said raising his hand I was with you as far as the
3Ls What are they A private code
Not a codeabbreviation Linear Logic Language the pitfall of all the
old researchers All of them historians sociologists political
analysts anthropologists were licked before they started They had to
know all about A and B before they could find C Facts to them were
always hooked up in a series Whereas in truth they had to be analyzed
as a complex circuit complete with elements like positive and negative
feedback and crossover switching With the whole thing being stirred up
constantly by continual homeostasis correction Its little wonder they
did do badly
You cant really say that Adao Costa protested Ill admit that
Societics has carried the art tremendously far ahead But there were
many basics that had already been discovered
Illustration
If you are postulating a linear progression from the old social
sciencesforget it Neel said There is the same relationship here
that alchemy holds to physics The old boys with their frog guts and
awful offal knew a bit about things like distilling and smelting But
there was no real order to their knowledge and it was all an
unconsidered byproduct of their single goal the whole nonsense of
transmutation
They passed a lounge and Adao waved Neel in after him dropping into a
chair He rummaged through his pockets for a cigarette organizing his
thoughts Im still with you he said But how do we work this back
to the kfactor
Simple Neel told him Once youve gotten rid of the 3Ls and their
false conclusions Remember that politics in the old days was all We are
angels and They are devils This was literally believed In the history
of mankind there has yet to be a war that wasnt backed by the official
clergy on each side And each declared that God was on their side Which
leaves You Know Who as prime supporter of the enemy This theory is no
more valid than the one that a single man can lead a country into war
followed by the inference that a welltimed assassination can save the
peace
That doesnt sound too unreasonable Costa said
Of course not All of the old ideas sound good They have a
simpleminded simplicity that anyone can understand That doesnt make
them true Kill a warminded dictator and nothing changes The
violenceorientated society the factors that produced it the military
party that represents itnone of these are changed The kfactor
remains the same
Theres that word again Do I get a definition yet
Neel smiled Of course The kfactor is one of the many factors that
interrelate in a society Abstractly it is no more important than the
other odd thousand we work with But in practice it is the only one we
try to alter
The kfactor is the war factor Adao Costa said All the humor was
gone now
Thats a good enough name for it Neel said grinding out his
halfsmoked cigarette If a society has a positive kfactor even a
slight one that stays positive then you are going to have a war Our
planetary operators have two jobs First to gather and interpret data
Secondly to keep the kfactor negative
They were both on their feet now moved by the same emotion
And Himmel has a positive one that stays positive Costa said Neel
Sidorak nodded agreement Then lets get into the ship and get going
he said
It was a fast trip and a faster landing The UN cruiser cut its engines
and dropped like a rock in free fall Night rain washed the ports and
the computer cut in the maximum permissible blast for the minimum time
that would reduce their speed to zero at zero altitude Deceleration sat
on their chests and squeezed their bones to rubber Something crunched
heavily under their stern at the exact instant the drive cut out Costa
was unbelted and out the door while Neel was still feeling his insides
shiver back into shape
The unloading had an organized rhythm that rejected Neel He finally
realized he could help best by standing back out of the way while the
crewmen gravlifted the heavy cases out through the cargo port into the
blackness of the rainlashed woods Adao Costa supervised this and
seemed to know what he was doing A signal rating wearing earphones
stood to one side of the lock chanting numbers that sounded like
detector fixes There was apparently enough time to unload
everythingbut none to spare Things got close towards the end
Neel was suddenly bustled out into the rain and the last two crates were
literally thrown out after him He plowed through the mud to the edge of
the clearing and had just enough time to cover his face before the
takeoff blast burst out like a new sun
Sit down and relax Costa told him Everything is in the green so
far The ship wasnt spotted on the way down Now all we have to do is
wait for transportation
In theory at least Adao Costa was Neels assistant In practice he took
complete charge of moving their equipment and getting it under cover in
the capital city of Kitezh Men and trucks appeared to help them and
vanished as soon as their work was done Within twenty hours they were
installed in a large loft all of the machines uncrated and plugged in
Neel took a nosleep and began tuning checks on all the circuits glad
of something to do Costa locked the heavy door behind their last silent
helper then dropped gratefully onto one of the bedding rolls
How did the gadgets hold up he asked
Im finding out now Theyre built to take punishmentbut being
dropped twelve feet into mud soup then getting baked by rockets isnt
in the original specs
They crate things well these days Costa said unworriedly sucking on
a bottle of the famous Himmelian beer When do you go to work
Were working right now Neel told him pulling a folder of papers out
of the file Before we left I drew up a list of current magazines and
newspapers I would need You can start on these Ill have a sampling
program planned by the time you get back
Costa groaned hollowly and reached for the papers
Once the survey was in operation it went ahead of its own momentum Both
men grabbed what food and sleep they could The computers gulped down
Neels figures and spat out tapereels of answers that demanded even
more facts Costa and his unseen helpers were kept busy supplying the
material
Only one thing broke the ordered labors of the week Neel blinked twice
at Costa before his equationfogged brain assimilated an immediate and
personal factor
Youve a bandage on your head he said A bloodstained bandage
A little trouble in the streets Mobs And thats an incredible feat of
observation Costa marveled I had the feeling that if I came in here
stark naked you wouldnt notice it
I  I get involved Neel said Dropping the papers on a table and
kneading the tired furrow between his eyes Get wrapped up in the
computation Sorry I tend to forget about people
Dont feel sorry to me Costa said Youre right Doing the job Im
supposed to help you not pose for the before picture in Home Hospital
ads Anywayhow are we doing Is there going to be a war Certainly
seems like one brewing outside Ive seen two people lynched who were
only suspected of being Earthies
Looks dont mean a thing Neel said opening two beers Remember the
analogy of the pile It boils liquid metal and cooks out energy from the
infrared right through to hard radiation Yet it keeps on generating
power at a nice steady rate But your Abomb at zero minus one second
looks as harmless as a fallen log Its the kfactor that counts not
surface appearance This planet may look like a dictators dream of
glory but as long as were reading in the negative things are fine
And how are things Hows our little kfactor
Coming out soon Neel said pointing at the humming computer Cant
tell about it yet You never can until the computation is complete
Theres a temptation to try and guess from the first figures but
theyre meaningless Like trying to predict the winner of a horse race
by looking at the starters lined up at the gate
Lots of people think they can
Let them There are few enough pleasures in this life without taking
away all delusions
Behind them the computer thunked and was suddenly still
This is it Neel said and pulled out the tape He ran it quickly
through his fingers mumbling under his breath Just once he stopped and
set some figures into his hand computer The result flashed in the
window and he stared at it unmoving
Good Bad What is it
Neel raised his head and his eyes were ten years older
Positive Bad Much worse than it was when we left Earth
How much time do we have
Dont know for certain Neel shrugged I can set it up and get an
approximation But there is no definite point on the scale where war
has to break out Just a going and going until somewhere along the
line
I know Gone Costa said reaching for his gun He slid it into his
side pocket Now its time to stop looking and start doing What do I
do
Going to kill War Marshal Lommeord Neel asked distastefully I
thought we had settled that you cant stop a war by assassinating the
top man
We also settled that something can be done to change the kfactor
The gun is for my own protection While youre radioing results back to
Earth and theyre feeling bad about it Im going to be doing something
Now you tell me what that something is
This was a different man from the relaxed and quietly efficient Adao
Costa of the past week All of his muscles were hard with the restrained
energy of an animal crouching to leap The gun ready in his pocket had
a suddenly new significance Neel looked away reaching around for
words This was all very alien to him and suddenly a little frightening
It was one thing to work out a kproblem in class and discuss the
theory of correction
It was something entirely different to direct the operation
Well Costas voice knifed through his thoughts
You can  well  its possible to change one of the peak population
curves Isolate individuals and groups then effect status and location
changes
You mean get a lot of guys to take jobs in other towns through the
commercial agents
Neel nodded
Too slow Costa withered the idea with his voice Fine in the long
run but of absolutely no value in an emergency He began to pace back
and forth Too quickly It was more of a bubblingover than a
relaxation Cant you isolate some recent key events that can be
reversed
Its possible Neel thought about it quickly It wouldnt be a final
answer just a delaying action
Thats good enough Tell me what to do
Neel flipped through his books of notes checking off the Beta13s
These were the reinforcers the individuals and groups who were kfactor
amplifiers It was a long list which he cut down quickly by crossing off
the low increment additions and multiple groups Even while the list was
incomplete Neel began to notice a pattern It was an unlikely one but
it was there He isolated the motivator and did a frequency check Then
sat back and whistled softly
We have a powerhouse here he said flipping the paper across the
table Take this organization out of the equations and you might even
knock us negative
Society for the Protection of the Native Born Costa read Doesnt
sound like very important Who or what are they
Proof positive of the law of averages Its possible to be dealt a
royal flush in a hand of cards but it isnt very common Its just as
possible for a bunch of simpletons to set up an organization for one
purpose and have it turn out to be a supercharged highfrequency
kfactor amplifier Thats whats happened with this infernal SPNB A
seedy little social club dedicated to jingoists with low IQs With
the war scare they have managed to get hold of a few credits They have
probably been telling the same inflated stories for years about the
discrimination against natives of this fair planet but no one has
really cared Now they have a chance to get their news releases and
faked pix out in quantity Just at a time when the public is ripe for
their brand of nonsense Putting this bunch out of business will be a
good days work
Wont there be repercussions Costa asked If they are this important
and throw so much weight aroundwont it look suspicious if they are
suddenly shut up Like an obvious move by the enemy
Not at all That might be true if for instance you blew up the
headquarters of the War Party It would certainly be taken as an
aggressive move But no one really knows or cares about this Society of
the Halfbaked Native Born There might be reaction and interest if
attention was drawn to them But if some accident or act of nature were
to put them out of business that would be the end of it
Costa was snapping his lighter on and off as he listened to Neel
staring at the flame He closed it and held it up I believe in
accidents I believe that even in our fireproof age fires still occur
Buildings still burn down And if a burnt building just happened to be
occupied by the SPNBjust one tenant of manyand their offices and
records were destroyed that would be of very little interest to anyone
except the fire brigade
Youre a born criminal Neel told him Im glad were on the same
side Thats your department and I leave it to you Ill just listen for
the news flashes Meanwhile I have one little errand to take care of
The words stopped Costa who was almost out the door He turned stiffly
to look at Neel putting papers into an envelope Yet Costa spoke
naturally letting none of his feelings through into his voice
Where are you going
To see Hengly the planetary operator here Abravanel told me to stay
away from him to run an entirely new basic survey Well weve done that
now and pinpointed some of the trouble areas as well I can stop
feeling guilty about poaching another mans territory and let him know
whats going on
No Stay away from Hengly Costa said The last thing in the world we
want to do is to be seen near him Theres a chance that he  well
might be compromised
What do you mean Neel snapped Henglys a friend of mine a
graduate
He might also be surrounded ten deep by the secret police Did you stop
to think about that
Neel hadnt thought about it and his anger vanished when he did Costa
drove the point home
Societics has been a well kept secret for over two centuries It may
still be a secretor bits of it might have leaked out And even if the
Himmelians know nothing about Societics they have certainly heard of
espionage They know the UN has agents on their world they might think
Hengly is one of them This is all speculation of course but we do
have one factthis Society of Native Boobs we turned up We had no
trouble finding them If Hengly had reliable field men he should know
about them too The only reason he hasnt is because he isnt getting
the information Which means hes compromised
Reaching back for a chair Neel fell heavily into it Youre right
of course I never realized
Good Costa said Well do something to help Hengly tomorrow but
this operation comes first Sit tight Get some rest And dont open the
door for anyone except me
It had been a long joband a tiring onebut it was almost over Neel
allowed himself the luxury of a long yawn then shuffled over to the
case of rations they had brought He stripped the seal from something
optimistically labeled CHICKEN DINNERit tasted just like the algae it
had been made fromand boiled some coffee while it was heating
And all the time he was doing these prosaic tasks his mind was turning
an indigestible fact over and over It wasnt a conscious process but
it was nevertheless going on The automatic mechanism of his brain ran
it back and forth like a half heard tune searching for its name Neel
was tired or he would have reacted sooner The idea finally penetrated
One fact he had taken for granted was an obvious impossibility
The coffee splashed to the floor as he jumped to his feet
Its wrong  it has to be wrong he said aloud grabbing up the
papers Computations and graphs dropped and were trampled into the
spilled coffee When he finally found the one he wanted his hands were
shaking as he flipped through it The synopsis of Henglys reports for
the past five years The gradual rise and fall of the kfactor from
month to month There were no sharp breaks in the curve or gaps in the
supporting equations
Societics isnt an exact science But its exact enough to know when it
is working with incomplete or false information If Hengly had been kept
in the dark about the SPNB he would also have been misinformed
about other factors This kind of alteration of survey would have to
show in the equations
It didnt
Time was running out and Neel had to act But what to do He must warn
Adao Costa And the records here had to be protected Or better yet
destroyed There was a power in these machines and charts that couldnt
be allowed to fall into nationalist hands But what could be done about
