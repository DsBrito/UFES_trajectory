Collegianthe university journal of those dayspublished most of
these and though no name was attached to the screeds it was fairly
well known that Holmes was the author The companion writers in the
Collegian were Simmons who wrote over the signature of Lockfast
John O Sargent poet and essayist whose nom de plume was Charles
Sherry Robert Habersham the Mr Airy of the group and that
clever young trifler Theodore Snow who delighted the readers of the
periodical with the works of Geoffrey La Touche Of these of
course Holmes was the life and soul and though sixty years have
passed away since he enriched the columns of the Collegian with the
fruits of his muse more than half of the pieces survive and are
deemed good enough to hold a place beside his maturer productions
Evening of a Sailor The Meeting of the Dryads and The Spectre
Pigthe latter in the vein of Tom Hood at his bestwill be
remembered as among those in the collection which may be read today
with the zest appreciation and delight which they inspired more
than half a century ago Holmes connection with the Collegian had a
most inspiriting effect on his fellow contributors who found their
wits sharpened by contact with a mind that was forever buoyant and
overflowing with humor and good nature In friendly rivalry those
kindred intellects vied with one another and no more brilliant
college paper was ever published than the Collegian and this is
more remarkable still when we come to consider the fact that at that
time literature in America was practically in its infancy Nine years
before Sydney Smith had asked his famous question Who reads an
American book who goes to an American play And to that query there
was really no answer Six numbers of the Collegian were issued and
they must have proved a revelation to the men and women of that day
whose reading hitherto had almost been confined to the imported
article from beyond the seas for Washington Irving wrote with the pen
of an English gentleman Bryant and Dana had not yet made their mark
in distinctively American authorship and Coopers Prairie was just
becoming to be understood by the critics and people
Shaking the dust of the law office from his shoes Oliver Wendell
Holmes abandoning literature for a time plunged boldly into the
study of a profession for which he had always evinced a strong
predilection The art and practice of medical science had ever a
fascination for him and he made rapid progress at the university
Once or twice he yielded to impulse and wrote a few bright things
anonymously for the Harbingerthe paper which Epes Sargent and
Park Benjamin published for the benefit of a charitable institution
and dedicated as a May gift to the ladies who had aided the New
England Institution for the Education of the Blind In 1833 Holmes
sailed for Paris where he studied medicine and surgery and walked
the hospitals Three years were spent abroad and then the young
student returned to Cambridge to take his medical degree at Harvard
and to deliver his metrical Essay on Poetry before the PhiBetaKappa
Society In this year too 1836 he published his first acknowledged
book of poemsa duodecimo volume of less than two hundred pages In
this collection his Essay on Poetry appeared It describes the art in
four stages viz the Pastoral or Bucolic the Martial the Epic
and the Dramatic In illustration of his views he furnished
exemplars from his own prolific muse and his striking poem of Old
Ironsides was printed for the first time and sprang at a bound into
national esteem And in this first book there was included that
little poem The Last Leaf better work than which Holmes has never
done It is in a vein which he has developed much since then Grace
humor pathos and happiness of phrase and idea are all to be found
in its delicious stanzas
I saw him once before
As he passed by the door
And again
The pavement stones resound
As he totters oer the ground
With his cane
They say that in his prime
Ere the pruningknife of Time
Cut him down
Not a better man was found
By the Crier on his round
Through the town
But now he walks the streets
And he looks at all he meets
Sad and wan
And he shakes his feeble head
That it seems as if he said
They are gone
The mossy marbles rest
On the lips that he has prest
In their bloom
And the names he loved to hear
Have been carved for many a year
On the tomb
My grandmamma has said
Poor old lady she is dead
Long ago
That he had a Roman nose
And his cheek was like a rose
In the snow
But now his nose is thin
And it rests upon his chin
Like a staff
And a crook is in his back
And a melancholy crack
In his laugh
I know it is a sin
For me to sit and grin
At him here
But the old threecornered hat
And the breeches and all that
Are so queer
And if I should live to be
The last leaf upon the tree
In the spring
Let them smile as I do now
At the old forsaken bough
Where I cling
In 1838 Doctor Holmes accepted his first professorial position and
became professor of anatomy and physiology at Dartmouth Two years
later he married and took up the practice of medicine in Boston In
1847 he returned to his old love accepting the Parkman professorship
of anatomy and physiology in the Medical School at Harvard While
engaged in teaching he prepared for publication several important
books and reports relating to his profession and his papers in the
various medical journals attracted great attention by their freshness
clearness and originality But it is not as a medical man that Doctor
Holmes may be discussed in this paper We have to deal altogether with
his literary careera career which for its brilliancy has not been
surpassed on this side of the Atlantic
As a poet he differs much from his contemporaries but the standard he
has reached is as high as that which has been attained by Lowell and
Longfellow In lofty verse he is strong and unconventional writing
always with a firm grasp on his subject and emphasizing his perfect
knowledge of melody and metre As a writer of occasional verse he has
not had an equal in our time and his pen for threescore years has
been put to frequent use in celebration of all sorts of events
whether military literary or scientific Bayard Taylor said He
lifted the occasional into the classic and the phrase happily
expresses the truth The vivacious character of his nature readily
lends itself to work of this sort and though the printed page gives
the reader the sparkling epigram and the graceful lines clearcut
always and full of soul the pleasure is not quite the same as seeing
and hearing him recite his own poems in the company of congenial
friends His songs are full of sunshine and heart and his literary
manner wins by its simplicity and tenderness Years ago Miss Mitford
said that she knew no one so thoroughly original For him she could
find no living prototype And so she went back to the time of John
Dryden to find a man to whom she might compare him And Lowell in his
Fable for Critics describes Holmes as
A Leydenjar fullcharged from which flit
The electrical tingles of hit after hit
His lyrical pieces are among the best of his compositions and his
ballads too few in number betray that love which he has always felt
for the melodious minstrelsy of the ancient bards Whittier thought
that the Chambered Nautilus was booked for immortality In the
same list may be put the OneHoss Shay Contentment
Destination How the Old Horse Won the Bet The Broomstick
Train and that lovely family portrait Dorothy Q a poem with
a history Dorothy Quincys picture cold and hard painted by an
unknown artist hangs on the wall of the poets home in Beacon Street
A hole in the canvas marks the spot where one of King Georges
soldiers thrust his bayonet The lady was Dr Holmes grandmothers
mother and she is represented as being about thirteen years of age
with
Girlish bust but womanly air
Smooth square forehead with uprolled hair
Lips that lover has never kissed
Taper fingers and slender wrist
Hanging sleeves of stiff brocade
So they painted the little maid
And the poet goes on
What if a hundred years ago
Those closeshut lips had answered no
When forth the tremulous question came
That cost the maiden her Norman name
And under the folds that look so still
The bodice swelled with the bosoms thrill
Should I be I or would it be
One tenth another to nine tenths me
Soft is the breath of a maidens yes
Not the light gossamer stirs with less
But never a cable that holds so fast
Through all the battles of wave and blast
And never an echo of speech or song
That lives in the babbling air so long
There were tones in the voice that whispered then
You may hear today in a hundred men
O lady and lover how faint and far
Your images hover and here we are
Solid and stirring in flesh and bone
Edwards and Dorothysall their own
A goodly record for time to show
Of a syllable spoken so long ago
Shall I bless you Dorothy or forgive
For the tender whisper that bade me live
It shall be a blessing my little maid
I will heal the stab of the redcoats blade
And freshen the gold of the tarnished frame
And gild with a rhyme your household name
So you shall smile on us brave and bright
As first you greeted the mornings light
And live untroubled by woes and fears
Through a second youth of a hundred years
Dr Holmes coloring is invariably artistic Nothing in his verse
offends the eye or grates unpleasantly on the ear He is a true
musician and his story joke or passing fancy is always joined to a
measure which never halts The Voiceless perhaps as well as Under
the Violets ought to be mentioned among the more tender verses which
we have from his pen in his higher mood
His novels are object lessons each one having been written with a
welldefined purpose in view But unlike most novels with a purpose
the three which he has written are nowise dull The first of the set
is The Professors Story or Elsie Venner the second is The
Guardian Angel written when the author was in his prime and the
third is A Mortal Antipathy written only a few years ago In no
sense are these works commonplace Their art is very superb and while
they amuse they afford the reader much opportunity for reflection
Elsie Venner is a romance of destiny and a strange physiological
condition furnishes the keynote and marrow of the tale It is Holmes
snake story the taint of the serpent appearing in the daughter whose
mother was bitten by a rattlesnake before her babe was born The
traits inherited by this unfortunate offspring from the reptile find
rapid development She becomes a creature of impulse and her life
spent in a New England village at a ladies academy with its social
and religious surroundings is described and worked out with rare
analytical skill and by a hand accustomed to deal with curious
scientific phenomena The character drawing is admirable the episodes
are striking and original and the scenery carefully elaborated is
managed with fine judgment Despite the idea which to some may at
first blush appear revolting and startling there is nothing
sensational in the book The reader observes only the growth and
movement of the poison in the girls system its effect on her way of
life and its remarkable power over her mind Horror or disgust at her
condition is not for one moment evoked The style is pure and
ennobling and while our sympathies may be touched we are at the same
time fascinated and entertained from the first page to the last Of
quite different texture is The Guardian Angel a perhaps more
readable story so far as form is concerned much lighter in
character and less of a study There is more plot but the range is
not so lofty It is less philosophical in tone than Elsie Venner
and the events move quicker The scene of The Guardian Angel is also
laid in an ordinary New England village and the object of the
DoctorNovelist was to write a tale in which the peculiarities and
laws of hysteria should find expression and development In carrying
out his plan Dr Holmes has achieved a genuine success He has taught
a lesson and at the same time has told a deeply interesting story
lightened up here and there with characteristic humor and wit The
characters of Myrtle Hazard and Byles Gridley are drawn with nice
discrimination while the sketch of the village poet Mr Gifted
Hopkins is so lifelike and realistic that he has only to be named
to be instantly recognized He is a type of the poet who haunts the
newspaper office and belongs to every town and hamlet His ladylove
is Miss Susan Posey a delicious creation in Dr Holmes best manner
These two prove excellent foils for the stronger personages of the
story and afford much amusement A Mortal Antipathy is less of a
romance than the others The reader will be interested in the
description of a boat race which is exquisitely done
In biographical writing we have two books from Dr Holmes one a
short life of Emerson and the other a memoir of Motley Though
capable of writing a great biography like Trevelyans Macaulay or
Lockharts Scott the doctor has not yet done so Of the two which he
has written the Motley is the better one In neither however has
the author arrived at his own standard of what a biography should be
Mechanism in thought and moralsa PhiBetaKappa address delivered
at Harvard in 1870is one of Dr Holmes most luminous contributions
to popular science It is ample in the way of suggestion and the
presentation of facts and though scientific in treatment the
captivating style of the essayist relieves the paper of all heaviness
A brief extract from this fine thoughtful work may be given here
We wish to remember something in the course of
conversation No effort of the will can reach it but we
say wait a minute and it will come to me and go on
talking Presently perhaps some minutes later the idea we
are in search of comes all at once into the mind delivered
like a prepaid bundle laid at the door of consciousness
like a foundling in a basket How it came there we know not
The mind must have been at work groping and feeling for it
in the dark it cannot have come of itself Yet all the
while our consciousness was busy with other thoughts
The literary reputation of Dr Holmes will rest on the three great
books which have made his name famous on two continents Thackeray had
passed his fortieth year before he produced his magnificent novel
Holmes too was more than forty when he began that unique and
original book The Autocrat of the Breakfast Table one of the most
thoughtful graceful and able investigations into philosophy and
culture ever written We have the author in every mood playful and
pathetic witty and wise Who can ever forget the young fellow
called John our Benjamin Franklin the Divinity student the
schoolmistress the landladys daughter and the poor relation What
characterization is there here The delightful talk of the autocrat
his humor always infectious his logic his strong common sense
illumine every page When he began to write Dr Holmes had no settled
plan in his head In November 1831 he sent an article to the New
England Magazine published by Buckingham in Boston followed by
another paper in February 1832 The idea next occurred to the author
in 1857a quarter of a century afterwards when the editors of the
Atlantic Monthly then starting on its career begged him to write
something for its pages He thought of The Autocrat and resolved
as he says to shake the same bough again and see if the ripe fruit
were better or worse than the early windfalls At a bound The
Autocrat leaped into popular favor The reading public could hardly
wait for the numbers All sorts of topics are touched upon from nature
to mankind There is the talk about the trees which one may read a
dozen times and feel the better for it And then comes that charming
account of the walk with the schoolmistress when the lovers looked
at the elms and the roses came and went on the maidens cheeks And
here is a paragraph or two which makes men think
Our brains are seventyyear clocks The angel of life winds
them up once for all then closes the case and gives the
key into the hand of the Angel of the Resurrection Tictac
tictac go the wheels of thought our will cannot stop
them they cannot stop themselves sleep cannot still them
madness only makes them go faster death alone can break
into the case and seizing the everswinging pendulum which
we call the heart silence at last the clicking of the
terrible escapement we have carried so long beneath our
wrinkled foreheads
If we could only get at them as we lie on our pillows and
count the dead beats of thought after thought and image
after image jarring through the overtired organ Will
nobody block those wheels uncouple that pinion cut the
string that holds those weights blow up the infernal
machine with gunpowder What a passion comes over us
sometimes for silence and restthat this dreadful
mechanism unwinding the endless tapestry of time
embroidered with spectral figures of life and death could
have but one brief holiday Who can wonder that men swing
themselves off from beams in hempen lassosthat they jump
off from parapets into the swift and gurgling waters
beneaththat they take counsel of the grim friend who has
but to utter his one peremptory monosyllable and the
restless machine is shivered as a vase that is dashed upon a
marble floor Under that building which we pass every day
there are strong dungeons where neither hook nor bar nor
bedcord nor drinking vessel from which a sharp fragment
may be shattered shall by any chance be seen There is
nothing for it when the brain is on fire with the whirling
of its wheels but to spring against the stone wall and
silence them with one crash Ah they remembered thatthe
kind city fathersand the walls are nicely padded so that
one can take such exercise as he likes without damaging
himself on the very plain and serviceable upholstery If
anybody would only contrive some kind of a lever that one
could thrust in among the works of this horrid automaton and
check them or alter their rate of going what would the
world give for the discovery
The Autocrat was followed by The Professor at the Breakfast
Tablea book in every way equal to the first one though to be
sure there are critics who pretend to see diminished power in the
authors pen It is however full of the same gentle humor and keen
analyses of the follies and foibles of human kind It is a trifle
graver though some of the characters belonging to The Autocrat come
to the front again It is in this book that we find that lovely story
of Irisa masterpiece in itself and one of the sweetest things that
has come to us for a hundred years rivalling to a degree the
delicious manner and style of Goldsmith and Lamb In 1873 the last of
the series appeared and The Poet came upon the scene to gladden the
breakfasters Every chapter sparkles with originality I have says
Dr Holmes unburdened myself in this book and in some other pages
of what I was born to say Many things that I have said in my riper
days have been aching in my soul since I was a mere child I say
aching because they conflicted with many of my inherited beliefs or
rather traditions I did not know then that two strains of blood were
striving in me for the masterytwo twenty perhaps twenty thousand
for aught I knowbut represented to me by twopaternal and maternal
But I do know this I have struck a good many chords first and last
in the consciousness of other people I confess to a tender feeling
for my little brood of thoughts When they have been welcomed and
praised it has pleased me and if at any time they have been rudely
handled and despitefully treated it has cost me a little worry I
dont despise reputation and I should like to be remembered as having
said something worth lasting well enough to last
There is much philosophy in The Poet and if it is less humorous
than The Autocrat it is more profound than either of its fellows in
the great trio In it the doctor has said enough to make the
reputations of half a dozen authors
One Hundred Days in Europe if written by anyone else save Dr
Holmes would perhaps go begging for a publisher But he journeyed
to the old land with his heart upon his sleeve He met nearly every
man and woman worth knowing and the Court Science and Literature
received him with open arms He had not seen England for half a
century Fifty years before he was an obscure young man studying
medicine and known by scarcely half a dozen persons He returned in
1886 a man of worldwide fame and every hand was stretched out to do
him honor and to pay him homage Lord Houghtonthe famous breakfast
giver of his time certainly the most successful since the princely
Rogershad met him in Boston years before and had begged him again
and again to cross the ocean Letters failing to move the poet
Houghton tried verse upon him and sent these graceful lines
When genius from the furthest West
Sierras Wilds and Poker Flat
Can seek our shores with filial zest
Why not the genial Autocrat
Why is this burden on us laid
That friendly London never greets
The peer of Locker Moore and Praed
From Bostons almost neighbor streets
His earlier and maturer powers
His own dear land might well engage
We only ask a few kind hours
Of his serene and vigorous age
Oh for a glimpse of glorious Poe
His raven grimly answers never
Will Holmess milder muse say no
And keep our hands apart forever
But he was not destined to see his friend When Holmes arrived in
England Lord Houghton was in his grave and so was Dean Stanley
whose sweetness of disposition had so charmed the autocrat when the
two men had met in Boston a few years before Ruskin he failed to meet
also for the distinguished wordpainter was ill At a dinner
however at ArchDeacon Farrars he spent some time with Sir John
Millais and Prof John Tyndall Of course he saw Gladstone Tennyson
Robert Browning Chief Justice Coleridge Du Maurier the illustrator
of Punch Prof James Bryce who wrote The American Commonwealth
Lord Wolseley Britains Only General His Grace of Argyll
Lord Lorne and the Princess Louiseone of the best amateur
painters and sculptors in Englandand many others Of all these
noted ones he has something bright and entertaining to say The
universities laid their highest honors at his feet Edinburgh gave him
the degree of LLD Cambridge that of Doctor of Letters and Oxford
conferred upon him her D C L his companion on the last occasion
being John Bright It was at Oxford that he met ViceChancellor
Benjamin Jowett the Master of Balliol College Prof Max Muller Lord
and Lady Herschell and Prof James Russell Lowell his old and
unvarying friend The account of his visit to Europe is told with most
engaging directness and simplicity and though the book has no
permanent value it affords much entertainment for the time
The reader will experience a feeling of sadness when he takes up Dr
Holmes last book Over the Teacups for there are indications in
the work which warn the public that the genial pen will write
hereafter less frequently than usual It is a witty and delightful
book recalling the Autocrat the Professor and the Poet and yet
presenting features not to be found in either The author dwells on
his advancing years but this he does not do in a querulous fashion
He speaks of his contemporaries and compares the ages of old trees
and over the teacups a thousand quaint curious and splendid things
are said The work takes a wide range but there is more sunshine than
anything else and that indefinable charm peculiar to the author
enriches every page One might wish that he would never grow old As
Lowell said a few years ago in a birthday verse to the doctor
You keep your youth as yon Scotch firs
Whose gaunt line my horizon hems
Though twilight all the lowland blurs
Hold sunset in their ruddy stems
Master alike in speech and song
Of fames great antisepticstyle
You with the classic few belong
Who tempered wisdom with a smile
Outlive us all Who else like you
Could sift the seed corn from our chaff
And make us with the pen we knew
Deathless at least in epitaph
PLUTOCRACY AND SNOBBERY IN NEW YORK
BY EDGAR FAWCETT
Let us imagine that a foreigner has entered a New York ballroom for
the first time and let us make that foreigner not merely an
Englishman but an Englishman of title He would soon be charmed by
the women who beamed on every side of him Their refinement of manner
would be obvious though in some cases they might shock him by a
shrillness and nasal harshness when speaking while in other cases
both their tone and accent might repel him through extreme affectation
of elegance But for the most part he would pronounce these women
bright cultivated and often remarkably handsome They would not
require to be amused or even entertained after the manner of his own
countrywomen they would appear before him amply capable of yielding
rather than exacting diversion and often through the mediums of
nimble wit engaging humor or an audacity at once daring and
picturesque But after a little more time our titled stranger would
begin to perceive that behind all this feminine sparkle and freshness
lurked a positive transport of humility He would discover that he had
swiftly become with these fashionable ladies an object of idolatry
and that all the single ones were thrilled with the idea of marrying
him while all the married ones felt pierced by the sad realization
that destiny had disqualified them for so golden a bit of luck He
would find himself assailed by questions about his precise English
rank and standing Had he any other title besides the one by which he
was currently known How long ago was it since his family had been
elevated to the peerage Did he personally know the Queen or the
Prince of Wales Was his mother Lady anybody before she married his
father Did he own several places in the country and if so what was
the name of each
The men would naturally be less inquisitive but then the men all
would have their Burke or DeBrett to consult at their clubs and could
look him up there as if he had been an unfamiliar word in the
dictionary And these male followers of fashion would for the most
part distress and perplex him He would be confronted with a mournful
fact in our social life the men who go out are nearly all silly
striplings who on reaching a sensible age discreetly remain at home
He would soon begin to perceive that New York society is a blending of
the ludicrous and pathetic The really charming women have two
terrible faults one which their fathers husbands and brothers have
taught them and one which they have apparently contracted without
extraneous aid The first is their worship of wealth their devout
genuflection before it as the sole choicest gift which fate can
bestow and the second is their merciless and metallic snobbery They
have made a god of caste and in a country where of all other cults
that of caste is the most preposterous The men the real grownup
men who may hate the big balls but are nevertheless a great deal in
the movement as regards other gay pastimes watch them with quiet
approbation Many a New York husband is quite willing that his wife
shall cut her own grandmother if that relative be not desirable The
men have not time to preen their social plumes quite so strenuously
they are too busy in moneygetting and of a sort which nearly always
concerns the hazard of the Wall Street die And yet quite a number of
the men are arrant snobs refusing to associate with often even to
notice others whose dollars count fewer than their own This form of
plutocratic selfadulation is relatively modern It is called by some
people a very inferior state of things to that which existed in the
good old Knickerbocker days But the truth is odious though the
millionnaires ascendancy may be at present that of the Knickerbocker
