been impossible to me but for the opportune appearance of your
admirable book
I could not but see that the book to which I have alluded like most
other modern books on Biblical criticism was altogether negative
was possessed too often by that fanaticism of disbelief which is
just as dangerous as the fanaticism of belief was picking the body
of the Scripture to pieces so earnestly that it seemed to forget
that Scripture had a spirit as well as a body or if it confessed
that it had a spirit asserting that spirit to be one utterly
different from the spirit which the Scripture asserts that it
possesses
For the Scripture asserts that those who wrote it were moved by the
Spirit of God that it is a record of Gods dealings with men which
certain men were inspired to perceive and to write down  whereas
the tendency of modern criticism is without doubt to assert that
Scripture is inspired by the spirit of man that it contains the
thoughts and discoveries of men concerning God which they wrote
down without the inspiration of God which difference seems to me
and I hope to others utterly infinite and incalculable and to
involve the question of the whole character honour and glory of
God
There is without a doubt something in the Old Testament as well
as in the New quite different in kind as well as in degree from
the sacred books of any other people  an unique element which has
had an unique effect upon the human heart life and civilization
This remains after all possible deductions for ignorance of
physical science errors in numbers and chronology
interpolations mistakes of transcribers and so forth whereof we
have read of late a great deal too much and ought to care for them
and for their existence or nonexistence simply nothing at all
because granting them allthough the greater part of them I do not
grant as far as I can trust my critical facultythere remains that
unique element beside which all these accidents are but as the
spots on the sun compared to the great glory of his lifegiving
light  The unique element is there and I cannot but still believe
after much thought that itthe powerful and working element the
inspired and Divine element which has converted and still converts
millions of soulsis just that which Christendom in all ages has
held it to be  the account of certain noble acts of Gods and
not of certain noble thoughts of manin a word not merely the
moral but the historic element and that therefore the value of
the Bible teaching depends on the truth of the Bible story  That is
my belief  Any criticism which tries to rob me of that I shall look
at fairly but very severely indeed
If all that a man wants is a religion he ought to be able to make
a very pretty one for himself and a fresh one as often as he is
tired of the old  But the heart and soul of man wants more than
that as it is written My soul is athirst for God even for the
living God  Those whom I have to teach want a living God who
cares for men works for men teaches men punishes men forgives
men saves men from their sins and Him I have found in the Bible
and nowhere else save in the facts of life which the Bible alone
interprets
In the power of man to find out God I will never believe  The
religious sentiment or Godconsciousness so much talked of
nowadays seems to me as I believe it will to all practical
commonsense Englishmen a faculty not to be depended on as
fallible and corrupt as any other part of human nature apt to
judge from history to develop itself into ugly forms not only
without a revelation from God but too often in spite of oneinto
polytheisms idolatries witchcrafts Buddhist asceticisms
Phoenician Molochsacrifices Popish inquisitions American spirit
rappings and what not  The hearts and minds of the sick the poor
the sorrowing the truly human all demand a living God who has
revealed himself in living acts a God who has taught mankind by
facts not left them to discover him by theories and sentiments a
Judge a Father a Saviour and an Inspirer in a word their hearts
and minds demand the historic truth of the Bibleof the Old
Testament no less than of the New
What I needed therefore for my guidance was a book which should
believe and confess all this without condemning or ignoring free
criticism and its results which should make use of that criticism
not to destroy but to build up which employed a thorough knowledge
of the Old Testament history the manners of the Jews the
localities of the sacred events to teach men not what might not be
in the Bible but what was certainly therein which dealt with the
Bible after the only fair and trustful method that is to consider
it at first according to the theory which it sets forth concerning
itself before trying quite another theory of the commentators own
invention and which combined with a courageous determination to
tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth that
Christian spirit of trust reverence and piety without which all
intellectual acuteness is but blindness and folly
All this and more I found in your book enforced with a genius
which needs no poor praise of mine and I hailed its appearance at
such a crisis as a happy Providence certain that it would be what
I now know by experience it has been a balm to many a wounded
spirit and a check to many a wandering intellect inclined in the
rashness of youth to throw away the truth it already had for the
sake of theories which it hoped that it might possibly verify
hereafter
With your book in my hand I have tried to write a few plain
Sermons telling plain people what they will find in the Pentateuch
in spite of all present doubts as their fathers found it before
them and as I trust their children will find it after them when
all this present whirlwind of controversy has past
As dust that lightly rises up
And is lightly laid again
I have told them that they will find in the Bible and in no other
ancient book that living working God whom their reason and
conscience demand and that they will find that he is none other
than Jesus Christ our Lord  I have not apologised for or explained
away the socalled Anthropomorphism of the Old Testament  On the
contrary I have frankly accepted it and even gloried in it as an
integral and I believe invaluable element of Scripture  I have
deliberately ignored many questions of great interest and
difficulty because I had no satisfactory solution of them to offer
but I have said at the same time that those questions were
altogether unimportant compared with those salient and fundamental
points of the Bible history on which I was preaching  And therefore
I have dared to bid my people relinquish Biblical criticism to those
who have time for it and to say of it with me as Abraham of the
planets O my people I am clear of all these things  I turn
myself to him who made heaven and earth
I do not wish believe me to make you responsible for any statement
or opinion of mine  I am painfully conscious on reviewing for the
Press Sermons which would never have been published save by special
request how imperfect poor and weak they seem to mehow much
worse then they will appear to other people how much more may be
said which I have not the wit to say  But the Bible can take care
of itself I presume without my help  All I can do is to speak
what I think as far as I see my way to record the obligation
toward you under which I with thousands more now lie and to
express my hope that we shall be always found together fellow
workers in the cause of Truth and that to you and in you may be
fulfilled those noble and tender words in which you have spoken of
Samuel and of those who work in Samuels spirit
In later times even in our own many names spring to our
recollection of those who have trodden or in different degrees
some known and some unknown are treading the same thankless path
in the Church of Germany in the Church of France in the Church of
Russia in the Church of England  Wherever they are and whosoever
they may be and howsoever they may be neglected or assailed or
despised they like their great prototype and likeness in the
Jewish Church are the silent healers who bind up the wounds of
their age in spite of itself they are the good physicians who bind
together the dislocated bones of a disjointed time they are the
reconcilers who turn the hearts of the children to the fathers or
of the fathers to the children  They have but little praise and
reward from the partisans who are loud in indiscriminate censure and
applause  But like Samuel they have a far higher reward in the
Davids who are silently strengthened and nurtured by them in Naioth
of Ramahin the glories of a new age which shall be ushered in
peacefully and happily after they have been laid in the grave 0b
That such my dear Stanley may be your work and your destiny is
the earnest hope of
Yours affectionately

SERMON I  GOD IN CHRIST
Septuagesima Sunday
GENESIS i  I  In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth
We have begun this Sunday to read the book of Genesis  I trust that
you will listen to it as you oughtwith peculiar respect and awe
as the oldest part of the Bible and therefore the oldest of all
known worksthe earliest human thought which has been handed down
to us
And what is the first written thought which has been handed down to
us by the Providence of Almighty God
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
How many other things how many hundred other things men might have
thought fit to write down for those who should come after and say
This is the first knowledge which a man should have this is the
root of all wisdom all power all wealth
But God inspired Moses and the Prophets to write as they have
written  They were not to tell men that the first thing to be
learnt was how to be rich nor how to be strong nor even how to be
happy  but that the first thing to be learnt was that God created
the heaven and the earth
And why first
Because the first question which man asksthe question which shows
he is a man and not a brutealways has been and always will be
Where am I  How did I get into this world and how did this world
get here likewise  And if man takes up with a wrong answer to that
question then the man himself is certain to go wrong in all manner
of ways  For a lie can never do anything but harm or breed
anything but harm and lies do breed as fast as the blight on the
trees or the smut on the corn  only being not according to nature
or the laws of God they do not breed as natural things do after
their kind  but belonging to chaos the kingdom of disorder and
misrule they breed fresh lies unlike themselves of all strange and
unexpected shapes so that when a man takes up with one lie there
is no saying what other lie he may not take up with beside
Wherefore the first thing man has to learn is truth concerning the
first human question Where am I  How did I come here and how did
this world come here  To which the Bible answers in its first line
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth
How God created the Bible does not tell us  Whether he created as
doubtless he could have done if he chose this world suddenly out of
nothing full grown and complete or whether he created it as he
creates you and me and all living and growing things now out of
things which had been before itthat the Bible does not tell us
Perhaps if it had told us it would have drawn away our minds to
think of natural things and what we now call science instead of
keeping our minds fixed as it now does on spiritual things and
above all on the Spirit of all spirits Him of whom it is written
God is a Spirit
For the Bible is simply the revelation or unveiling of God  It is
not a book of natural science  It is not merely a book of holy and
virtuous precepts  It is not merely a book wherein we may find a
scheme of salvation for our souls  It is the book of the
revelation or unveiling of the Lord God Jesus Christ what he was
what he is and what he will be for ever
Of Jesus Christ  How is he revealed in the text In the beginning
God created the heaven and the earth
ThusIf you look at the first chapter of Genesis and the beginning
of the second you will see that God is called therein by a
different name from what he is called afterwards  He is called God
Elohim The High or Mighty One or Ones  After that he is called the
Lord God Jehovah Elohim which means properly The High or Mighty I
Am or Jehovah a word which I will explain to you afterwards  That
word is generally translated in our Bible as it was in the Greek
The Lord because the later Jews had such a deep reverence for the
name Jehovah that they did not like to write it or speak it  but
called God simply Adonai the Lord
So that we have three names for God in the Old Testament
First El or Elohim the Mighty One  by which so Moses says God
was known to the Jews before his time and which sets forth Gods
power and majestythe first thing of which men would think in
thinking of God
Next Jehovah  The I Am the Eternal and Selfexistent Being by
which name God revealed himself to Moses in the burning busha
deeper and wider name than the former
And lastly Adonai the Lord the living Ruler and Master of the
world and men by which he revealed himself to the later Jews and
at last to all mankind in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ
Now I need not to trouble your mind or my own with arguments as to
how these three different names got into the Bible
That is a matter of criticism of scholarship with which you have
nothing to do  and you may thank God that you have not in such
days as these  Your business is not how the names got there which
is a matter of criticism but why they have been left there by the
providence of God which is a matter of simple religion and you may
thank God I say again that it is so  For scholarship is Marthas
part which must be done and yet which cumbers a man with much
serving  but simple heart religion is the better part which Mary
chose and of which the Lord has said that it shall not be taken
from her nor from those who like her sit humbly at the feet of
the Lord and hear his voice without troubling their souls with
questions of words and endless genealogies which eat out the
hearts of men
Therefore all I shall say about the matter is that the first chapter
of Genesis and the first three verses of the second may be the
writing of a prophet older than Moses because they call God Elohim
which was his name before Moses time and that Moses may have used
them and worked them into a book of Genesis while he in the part
which he wrote himself called God at first by the name Jehovah
Elohim The Lord God in order to show that Jehovah and El were the
same God and not two different ones and after he had made the Jews
understand that went on to call God simply Jehovah and to use the
two names as they are used through the rest of the Old Testament
interchangeably  as we say sometimes God sometimes the Lord
sometimes the Deity and so forth meaning of course always the same
Being
That I think is the probable and simple account which tallies most
exactly with the Bible
As for the first five books of the Bible the Pentateuch having
been written by Moses or at least by far the greater part of them
I cannot see the least reason to doubt it
The Bible itself does not say so and therefore it is not a matter
of faith and men may have their own opinions on the matter without
sin or false doctrine  But that Moses wrote part at least of them
our Lord and his Apostles say expressly  The tradition of the Jews
who really ought to know best has always been that Moses wrote
either the whole or the greater part  Moses is by far the most
likely man to have written them of all of whom we read in
Scripture  We have not the least proof and what is more never
shall or can have that he did not write them  And therefore I
advise you to believe as I do that the universal tradition of both
Jews and Christians is right when it calls these books the books
of Moses 7
But now no more of these matters  we will think of a matter quite
infinitely more important and that is WHO is this God whom the
Bible reveals to us from the very first verse of Genesis
At least he is one and the same Being  Whether he be called El
Jehovah or Adonai he is the same Lord
It is the Lord who makes the heaven and the earth the Lord who puts
man in a Paradise lays on him a commandment and appears to him in
visible shape
It is the Lord who speaks to Abraham  though Abraham knew him only
as ElShaddai the Almighty God  It is the Lord who brings the
Israelites out of Egypt who gives them the law on Sinai  It is the
Lord who speaks to Samuel to David to all the Prophets and
appears to Isaiah while his glory fills the Temple  In whatever
divers manners and many portions as St Paul says in the
Epistle to the Hebrews he speaks to them he is the same Being
And Psalmists and Prophets are most careful to tell us that he is
the God not of the Jews only but of the Gentiles of all mankind
as indeed he must be being Jehovah the I Am the one Self
existent and Eternal Being that from his throne he is watching and
judging all the nations upon earth fashioning the hearts of all
appointing them their bounds and the times of their habitation if
haply they may seek after him and find him though he be not far
from any one of them for in him they live and move and have their
being
This is the message of Moses of the Psalmists and the Prophets
just as much as of St Paul on Mars Hill at Athens
So begins and so ends the Old Testament revealing throughout The
Lord
And how does the New Testament begin
By telling us that a Babe was born at Bethlehem and called Jesus
the Saviour
But who is this blessed Babe  He too is The Lord
A Saviour which is Christ the Lord  And from thence through the
Gospels the Acts the Epistles the Revelation of St John he is
the Lord  There is no manner of doubt of it  The Apostles and
Evangelists take no trouble to prove it  They take it for granted
They call Jesus Christ by the name by which the Jews had for
hundreds of years called the El of Abraham the Jehovah of Moses
The Babe who is born at Bethlehem who grows up as other human
beings grow into the man Christ Jesus is none other than the Lord
God who created the universe who made a covenant with Abraham who
brought the Israelites out of Egypt who inspired the Prophets who
has been from the beginning governing all the earth
It is very awful  But you must believe that or put your Bibles
away as a dreamNew Testament and Old alike  Not to believe that
fully and utterly is not to believe the Bible at all  For that is
what the Bible says and has been sent into the world to say  It
is from beginning to end the book of the revelation or unveiling
of Jesus Christ very God of very God
But some may say Why tell us that  Of course we believe it  We
should not be Christians if we did not
Be it so  I hope it is so  But I think that it is not so easy to
believe it as we fancy
We believe it I think more firmly than our forefathers did five
hundred years ago on some points and therefore we have got rid of
many dark and blasphemous superstitions about witches and devils
about the evil of the earth and of our own bodies of marriage and
of the common duties and bonds of humanity which tormented them
because they could not believe fully that Jesus Christ had created
and still ruled the world and all therein
But we are all too apt still to think of Jesus Christ merely as some
one who can save our souls when we die and to forget that he is the
Lord who is and has been always ruling the world and all mankind
And from this come two bad consequences  People are apt to speak of
the Lord Jesusor at least to admire preachers who speak of himas
if he belonged to them and not they to him and therefore to
speak of him with an irreverence and a familiarity which they dared
not use if they really believed that this same Jesus whose name
they take in vain is none other than the Living God himself their
Creator by whom every blade of grass grows beneath their feet
every planet and star rolls above their heads
And nextthey fancy that the Old Testament speaks of our Lord Jesus
Christ only in a few mysterious propheciessome of which there is
reason to suspect they quite misinterpret  They are slow of heart
to believe all that the Scriptures have spoken of him of whom Moses
and the Prophets did write not in a few scattered texts but in
every line of the Old Testament from the first of Genesis to the
last of Malachi
And therefore they believe less and less that Jesus Christ is still
the Lord in any real practical sensenot merely the Lord of a few
elect or saints but the Lord of man and of the earth and of the
whole universe  They think of him as a Lord who will come again to
judgmentwhich is true and awfully true in the very deepest
sense  but they do not think of himin spite of what he himself
and his apostles declared of himas The Living Working Lord to
whom all power is given in heaven and earth and not merely over the
souls of a few regenerate as the Alpha and Omega the first and the
last of whom St Paul says that the mystery of Christ has been
hid from the beginning of the world in God who created all things
by Jesus Christ    That in the dispensation of the fulness of
times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both
which are in heaven and which are in earth  They fill their minds
with fancies about the book of Revelation most of which there is
reason to fear are little else but fancies  while they overlook
what that book really does say and what is the best news that the
world ever heard that he is the Prince of the kings of the earth
Therefore they have fears for Christs Bible fears for Christs
Church fears for the fate of the world which they could not have
if they would recollect who Christ is and believe that he is able
to take care of his own kingdom and power and glory better than man
can take care of it for him  Surely surely faith in the living
Lord who rules the world in righteousness is fast dying out among
us and many who call themselves Christians seem to know less of
Christ and of the work which he is carrying on in the world than
did the old Psalmist who said of him The Lord shall endure for
ever he hath also prepared his seat for judgment  For he shall
judge the world in righteousness and minister true judgment among
the people  He fashioneth the hearts of all of them and
understandeth all their works
Who can say that he believes that who holds that this world is the
devils world and that sinful man and evil spirits are having it
all their own way till the day of judgment
Who can say that he believes that who falls into pitiable terror at
every new discovery of science or of scholarship for fear it should
destroy the Bible and the Christian faith instead of believing that
all which makes manifest is light and that all light comes from the
Father of lights by the providence of Jesus Christ his only
begotten Son who is the light of men and the inspiration of his
Spirit who leadeth into all truth
And how lastly can those say that they believe that who will lie
and slander and have recourse to base intrigues in order to defend
that truth and that Church of which the Lord himself has said that
he has founded it upon a rock and the gates of hell shall not
prevail against it
But if you believe indeed the message of the Bible that Jesus
Christ is the Lord who made heaven and earth then it shall be said
of you as it was of St Peter Blessed art thou  for flesh and
blood hath not revealed it to thee but my Father which is in
heaven
Yes  Blessed indeed is he who believes that who believes that the
same person who was born in a stable had not where to lay his head
went about healing the sick and binding up the broken heart
suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified dead and buried and
rose again the third day and ascended into heavenascended thither
that he might fill all things and is none other than the Lord of
the earth and of men the Creator the Teacher the Saviour the
Guide the King the Judge of all the world and of all worlds
past present and to come
For to him who thus believes shall be fulfilled the promise of his
Lord Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden and I
will give you rest
He will find rest unto his soul  Rest from that first and last
question of which I said that all men down to the lowest savage
ask it simply because they are men and not beasts  Where am I
How came I here  How came this world here likewise  For he can
answer
I am in the kingdom of the Babe of Bethlehem  He put me here  And
he put this world here likewise  and that is enough for me  He
created all I see or can seeI care little how provided that HE
created it for then I am sure that it must be very good  He
redeemed me and all mankind when we were lost at the price of his
most precious blood  He the Lord is King therefore will I not be
moved though the earth be shaken and the hills be carried into the
midst of the sea  Yea though the sun were turned to darkness and
the moon to blood and the stars fell from heaven and all power and
order all belief and custom of mankind were turned upside down
yet there would still be One above who rules the world in
righteousness whose eye is on them that fear him and put their
trust in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to feed
them in the time of dearth  Darkness may cover the land for awhile
and gross darkness the people  But while I sit in darkness the
Lord shall be my light till the day when he shall say once more
Let there be light and light shall be
Yes  To the man who is a good man and true who has any hearty
Christian feeling for his fellowmen and is not merely a selfish
superstitious person caring for nothing but what he calls the
safety of his own soul to the man I say who has anything of the
loving spirit of Christ in him what question can be more important
than this Is the world well made or ill  Is it well governed or
ill  Is it on the whole going right or going wrong  And what can
be more comforting to such a man than the answer which the Bible
gives him at the outset
This world is well made in love and care for Christ the Lord made
it and behold it was very good
This world is going right and not wrong in spite of all appearances
to the contrary for Christ the Lord is King  He sitteth between
the cherubim be the earth never so unquiet  He is too strong and
too loving to let the world go any way but the right  Parts of it
will often go wrong here and go wrong there  The sin and ignorance
of men will disturb his order and rebel against his laws and
strange and mad things terrible and pitiable things will happen as
they have happened ever since the day when the first man disobeyed
the commandment of the Lord  But man cannot conquer the Lord the
Lord will conquer man  He will teach men by their neighbours sins
He will teach them by their own sins  He will chastise them by sore
judgments  He will make fearful examples of wilful and conceited
sinners and those who seem to escape him in this life shall not
escape him in the life to come  But he is trying for ever every
mans work by fire and against that fire no lie will stand  He
will burn up the stubble and chaff and leave only the pure wheat
for the use of future generations  His purpose will stand  His
word will never return to him void but will prosper always where he
sends it  He has made the round world so sure that it cannot be
moved either by man or by worse than man  His everlasting laws will
take effect in spite of all opposition and bring the world and man
along the path and to the end which he purposed for them in the
day when God made the heavens and the earth and in that even
greater day when he said Let us make man in our image after our
likeness and man arose upright and knew that he was not as the
beasts and asked who he was and where feeling with the hardly
opened eyes of his spirit after that Lord from whom he came and to
whom he shall return as many as have eternal life in the day when
Christ the Lord of life shall have destroyed death and put all
enemies under his feet and given up the kingdom to God even the
Father that God may be all in all
SERMON II  THE LIKENESS OF GOD
Trinity Sunday
GENESIS i 26  And God said Let us make man in our image after
our likeness
This is a hard saying  It is difficult at times to believe it to be
true
If one looks not at what God has made man but at what man has made
himself one will never believe it to be true
When one looks at what man has made himself at the back streets of
some of our great cities at the thousands of poor Germans and Irish
across the ocean bribed to kill and to be killed they know not why
at the abominable wrongs and cruelties going on in Poland at this
momentthe cry whereof is going up to the ears of the God of Hosts
and surely not in vain when one thinks of all the cries which have
gone up in all ages from the victims of mans greed lust cruelty
tyranny and shrillest of all from the tortured victims of his
superstition and fanaticism it is difficult to answer the sneer
Believe if you can that this foolish unjust cruel being called
man is made in the likeness of God  Man was never made in the
image of God at all  He is only a cunninger sort of animal for
better for worseand for worse as often as for better
Another says not quite that  Man was in the likeness of God once
