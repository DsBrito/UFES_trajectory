POISE ITS NEED ITS ENEMIES ITS EFFECT
CHAPTER I
THE NEED OF POISE IN LIFE
Lack of poise has always been an obstacle to those who are imbued with
the desire to succeed
In every age the awkwardness born of timidity has served to keep back
those who suffered from it but this defect has never been so great a
drawback as in the life of today
The celebrated phrase of the ancient Roman writer who said Fortune
smiles on the brave could very well serve as our motto nowadays with
this slight alteration Fortune smiles on those who are possest of
poise
At this point let us attempt an exact definition of poise
It is a quality which enables us to judge of our own value and which
in revealing to us the knowledge of the things of which we are really
capable gives us at the same time the desire to accomplish them
It is not a quality wholly simple On the contrary it is a composite of
many others all of which take part in the molding of that totality which
bears the name of poise
It may be well to pass in review the principal qualities of which it is
composed that one may characterize as follows
Will
Reason
Knowledge of ones own value
Correctness of judgment
Sincerity toward oneself
The power of resisting the appeals of selflove
Contempt of adverse criticism
Pride that is free from vanity
A definite and clearly conceived ambition
Will as is well known is the pivot of all our resolutions whether the
question for the moment be how to form them or how to keep them when
formed
A man without willpower is a straw blown about by every wind and
carried whether he will or no into situations in which he has no valid
reason for finding himself
Without the willpower which enables us to take a firm hold of ourselves
and to get a grip upon our impressions they will remain vague and
nebulous without presenting to us characters of sufficient definiteness
to enable us to direct them readily into the proper channels
It is willpower which gives us the force to maintain a resolution which
will lead us to the hopedfor goal of success
It is willpower also which enables us to correct the faults which stand
in the way of the acquiring of poise
We are not now speaking of those idle fancies which are no more than
manifestations of nervousness We have in mind rather that controlled
and enduring purpose which arms the heart against the assaults of the
emotions by giving it the strength to overcome them
There are many cases even in which willpower has led to their entire
suppression
This happens more particularly in the case of those artificial emotions
that the man of resolution ignores completely but which cause agony to
the timid who do not know how to escape them and exaggerate them to
excess
This abnormal development of their personalities is the peculiarity of
the timid which their fitful efforts of will only heighten alienating
from them the sympathy which might be of assistance to them
They take refuge in a species of mischievous and fruitless activity
leaving the field open to the development of all sorts of imaginary ills
that argument does not serve to combat
Their ego whose importance is in no way counterbalanced by their
appreciation of the friends they keep at a distance fills their entire
existence to such an extent that they have no doubt whatever that when
they are in public every eye is of necessity fixt upon them
Their negative will leaves them at the mercy of every sort of emotion
which in arousing in them the necessity of a reaction they feel
themselves powerless to realize reduces them to a state of inferiority
that when it becomes known is the source of grave embarrassment to
them
The power of will which sustains those who wish to acquire the habit of
poise is then the capacity to accomplish acts solely because one has
the ardent desire to achieve them
We are now speaking understand neither of extreme heroism or of
impossibilities
Another point presents itself here Willpower in order to preserve its
energy must be sustained and fixt At this price alone can we achieve
poise We must therefore thoroughly saturate ourselves with this
principle Reasoningpower is an essential element in the upbuilding of
poise
It is reasoningpower which teaches us to distinguish between those
things that we must be careful to avoid and those which are part and
parcel of the domain of exaggeration and fantasy
It is also by means of reasoning that we arrive at the proper
appreciation of the just mean that we must observe It is by its aid
that we are enabled to disentangle those impulses that will prove
profitable from a chaos of useless risks
It is always by virtue of deductions depending upon reason that we are
able to adopt a resolution or to maintain an attitude that we believe to
be correct while preserving our selfpossession under circumstances in
which persons of a timorous disposition would certainly lose their
heads
Those who know how to reason never expose themselves to the possibility
of being unhorsed by fate for lack of good reasons for strengthening
themselves in their chosen course
They adhere in the very heat of discussion and in spite of the
onslaughts of destiny to the line of conduct that sage reflection has
taught them to adopt and are more than careful never to abandon it
except for the most valid reasons
They never stray into the byways in which the timid and the shrinking
constantly wander without sufficient thought of the goal toward which
they are journeying
They know where they are going and if now and again they ask for
information about the road that remains to be traveled it is with no
intention of changing their course but simply so as not to miss the
short cuts and to lose nothing of the pleasures of the scenes through
which they may pass
Reasoningpower is the trademark of superior minds Mediocre natures
take no interest in it and as we have seen the timid are incapable of
it except in so far as it follows the beaten path
True poise never is guided by anything but reason Certain risks can
never be undertaken save after ripe deliberation
Confusion is never the fate of those who are resolved on a definite line
of conduct
Such people are careful to plumb the questions with which they have to
grapple and to weigh the inconveniences and the advantages of the acts
they have the desire to accomplish
When their decision is once made however nothing will prevent the
completion of the work they have begun Such people are ripe for
success
The knowledge of ones real worth is a quality doubly precious when
contrasted with the fact that the majority of people are more than
indulgent to their own failings Of many of them it may be said in the
words of the Arab proverb couched in the language of imagery This man
has no money but in his pocket everything turns to gold
This saying divested of the language of hyperbole means simply that
the man in question is so obsessed with the greatness of his own
personal value that he exaggerates the importance of everything that
concerns him
This condition is a much more common one than one might at first
believe Many an occurrence which when it happens to some one else
seems to us quite devoid of interest becomes when it directly affects
us a matter to compel the attention of others to the extent that we
find ourselves chilled and disappointed when we discover that we are the
victims of that indifference which we were prepared to exhibit toward
other people under similar circumstances
The consciousness of our own worth must not be confounded with that
adoration of self which transforms poise into egotism
It is a good thing to know ones own powers sufficiently well to
undertake only such tasks as are certainly within the scope of ones
abilities
To believe oneself more capable than one really is is a fault that is
far too common It is nevertheless less harmful in the long run than
the failing which is its exact antithesis Lack of confidence in ones
own powers is the source of every kind of feebleness and of all
unsuccess
It is for this reason that poise never can exist without another
quality that correctness of judgment which in giving us the breadth of
mind to know exactly how much we are capable of permits us to undertake
our tasks without boasting and without hesitation
Soundness of judgment is the faculty of being able to appreciate the
merits of our neighbors without cherishing any illusions as to our own
and of being able to do this so exactly that we can with assurance carry
out to its end any undertaking knowing that the result must be barring
accidents precisely what we have foreseen
This being the case what possible reason can we have for depreciating
ourselves or for lacking poise
Timid people suffer without recognizing their own defects in the matter
of insight
They torture themselves by building their judgments upon indications and
not upon facts
If the perception of a man of resolution causes him to understand at
once the emptiness of criticisms based on envy or spleen the timid man
always ready to seize upon anything that can be possibly construed into
an appearance of ridicule directed against himself will give up a
project that he hears criticized without stopping to weigh the value of
the arguments advanced
Far from arguing the question out or attempting a rebuttal he never
even dreams of it The very thought of a contest however courteously it
may be conducted frightening him to such an extent that he loses all
his ideas
The unfortunate shrinking which characterizes him makes him an easy prey
for people of exaggerated enthusiasms as well as to quick
disillusionment
A token of apparent sympathy touches him so profoundly that he does not
wait to estimate its value and to decide whether it be sincere or not
He passes in a moment from careless gaiety to the blackest despair if he
imagines that he has observed even the appearance of an unsympathetic
gesture
He does not need to be sure to be miserable It is enough for him if
the circumstances that he thought favorable become seemingly hostile and
antagonistic
How utterly different is the attitude of the man who is endowed with
poise
His firmness of soul saves him from unconsidered enthusiasms and he
jealously preserves his control in the presence of excessive
protestations as well as when confronting indications of aimless
antagonism
How can such a man as this possibly fail to form a correct judgment and
to benefit by all the qualities that depend upon it
Absolute sincerity toward oneself is one of the forms of sound judgment
Without indulging in excessive modesty it is a good thing to endeavor
to become intimately acquainted with ones aptitudes and ones failings
and to admit the latter with the utmost frankness in order to set about
the work of correcting them
It is also necessary to know exactly what sort of territory it is in
which one is taking ones risks
The world of affairs whatever these last may happen to be may be
likened to a vast preserve containing traps for wild beasts
The man who wishes to walk in such a place without coming to harm will
first of all make a careful study of the ground for the purpose of
avoiding the traps and pitfalls that may engulf him or wound him as he
passes
Just as soon as he has located these dangers his step becomes firm and
he can advance with a tranquil gait and head upraised along the paths
which he knows do not conceal any dangerous surprizes
These are the pitfalls that most frequently threaten that daring that we
sometimes find in the timid
Their very defects preventing them from making proper comparisons they
are altogether too prone to ignore their faults and to magnify their
virtues and so fall an easy prey to the designer and the sharper
Their very carelessness in estimating other people becomes the
foundation of an involuntary partiality the moment they are called upon
to judge their own actions
It is not deliberate selfindulgence that drives them to act in this
way but their inexperience which gives rise in them to the desire for
perfection and this necessarily provokes simultaneously with the
despair caused by their failure to attain it a fear of having this
failure remarked or commented upon
The man who possesses poise is too familiar with the realities of life
not to be aware that the search for such an ideal is a Utopian dream
But he is also aware that if actual perfection does not exist it is
the bounden duty of man to struggle always in pursuit of good and to
show appreciation of it in whatsoever form it may manifest itself
Sincerity toward himself thus becomes for him an easy matter indeed and
for the very reason that his poise leaves him absolutely free to form a
correct estimate of others
Serious selfexamination throws a clear light for him upon those merits
of which he has a right to be proud while revealing to him at the same
time the faults to which he is most likely to yield
The habit of estimating himself and his own qualities without fear or
favor gives him great facility for gaging the motives of other people
He thus avoids the pitfalls that a biased viewpoint spreads before the
feet of the foolish and at the same time represses that feeling of
vanity which might lead him to believe that he is altogether too clever
to fall into them
He watches himself constantly to avoid getting into the bypaths which he
sees with sorrow that others are following and does not fail to
estimate accurately the value of the victories he achieves over himself
as well as over the duplicity of most of the people who surround him
And this superiority is what makes certain his poise More difficult
perhaps than anything else to acquire is the power to resist the appeals
of ones own selflove
We will explain this later at greater length Lack of poise is often due
to nothing so much as an excess of vanity which throws one back upon
oneself from the fear of not being able to shine in the front rank
Such a person does not say to himself I will conquer this place by
sheer merit He contents himself with envying those who occupy it
quite neglecting to put forth the efforts which would place him there
beside them
There is nothing worse than yielding to an exaggerated tenderness toward
ourselves which by magnifying our merits in our own eyes frequently
leads us to make attempts which result in failure and expose us to
ridicule
This is a most frequent cause of making an inveterate coward of one who
is subject to occasional attacks of timidity
To know ones limitations exactly and never to allow oneself to exceed
themthis is the part of wisdom the act of a man who as the saying
goes knows what he is about
There is in every effort a necessary limit that it is not wise to
exceed
Never force your talents says a very pithy proverb Never undertake
to do a thing that is beyond your powers
Never allow yourself to be drawn into a discussion on a subject which is
beyond your intellectual depth To do so is to take the risk of making
mistakes that will render you ridiculous
But if you are quite convinced that you can come out victorious never
hesitate to enter a trial of wits that may serve as an occasion for
demonstrating the fact that you are sure of your subject
The man who cultivates poise will never let pass such opportunities as
this for exhibiting himself in a favorable light
Conscious of the soundness of his own judgment and filled with a real
sincerity toward himself he will not allow himself to be carried away
by a possible chance of success Rather will he gather himself together
collect his forces and wait until he can achieve a real effect upon the
minds of those whom he wishes to impress
Similarly the result of unsuccess in such a venture is obvious It has
the effect of developing a distrust of oneself and of destroying the
superb assurance of those people of whom it is often said Oh he He
is sailing with the wind at his back
People generally fail to add in these cases that such persons have left
nothing undone to accomplish this result and are more than careful not
to weigh anchor when the wind is not favorable
It is true enough that there can be no actual shelter from a storm but
the mariner who is prepared is able to ride it out without appreciable
damage while those who are not prepared generally founder on account of
their poor seamanship
Disregard of calumny is always the index of a noble spirit
The man who wastes time over such indignities and who allows himself to
be affected by them is not of the stature that insures victory in the
struggle
Minds of large caliber disdain these manifestations of futile jealousy
People of obscurity are never vilified Only those whose merits have
placed them in the limelight are the targets for the attacks of envy and
for the slanders of falsehood
A precept that has often been enunciated and can not be too often
repeated which should indeed be inscribed in letters of gold over the
doors of every institution where men meet together runs as follows
Envy and malice are nothing more than homage rendered to superiority
Only those who occupy an enviable position can become objects of
calumny
Such calumny is always the work of the unworthy who think to advertise
their own merits by denying those of better men
Men of resolution under such circumstances simply shrug their shoulders
and pass by
The rest those who are enslaved by timidity become confused
Their ego which they cultivated in a fashion at once obscure and
absolute becomes so profoundly affected that they lack all courage to
openly defend it
Moreover that instinctive need of sympathy which is so marked a
characteristic of the timid is deeply wounded while their chronic fear
of disapprobation is strengthened by the criticisms spread abroad
The illogicality of these sentiments is obvious The man who is timid
shuns society yet nevertheless the judgments of this same society are
for him a question of absorbing interest Timidity is in effect a
disease of many forms every one of which is founded upon illogicality
It is always a mental weakness It is sometimes vanity but never pride
that reasonable pride that a philosophy now abandoned once numbered as
one of the principal vices and which if rightly estimated can be
considered as the motive power of every noble action
Pride is a force It is therefore a virtue which must of necessity be
one of the components of poise so long as it contains within it no
seeds of vanity Under such circumstances it is a primal condition of
success in the achievement of poise Pride must however be free from
vanity otherwise it ceases to be a force and becomes a cause of
deterioration
As a matter of fact those who are conceited are always the dupes of
their own desire to bulk largely in the minds of others and at the mere
thought that they will not shine as they have hoped to do the majority
of them are put entirely out of countenance and are quite at a loss for
means of expression
The inevitable result of this tendency is to drive them into association
with mediocrity In such a society alone will the vain find themselves
at their ease But the very moment that they find themselves in the
presence of those who are their superiors the fear of not being able to
occupy the front rank throws them into such a state of mental disarray
that they entirely lose their assurance and that appearance of poise by
whose aid they are often able to deceive others
Finally one of the most solid elements of poise is without doubt a
welldefined ambition that is to say one that is divested of the
drawbacks of frivolity and directly winged toward the goal of ones
hopes
The man who possesses ambition of this kind is certainly destined to
acquire if he has not already acquired it that poise which is
absolutely necessary to him in order to make his way in the world
He will neither be pretentious nor timorous exaggerated nor fearful He
will go forward without hesitation toward the goal which he knows to be
before him and will make without any apologies those detours which
seem to him necessary to the success of his undertaking without paying
any attention to the fruitless distractions that make victims of the
rash
He will not have to put up with the affront of being refused for he
will ask aid only of those persons who for various reasons he is
practically sure will be of assistance to him The knowledge of his own
deserts while keeping him in the position he has attained will prevent
him from being satisfied in commonplace surroundings and his willpower
will always maintain him at the level he has reached permitting him no
latitude save that of exceeding it
Such is true poise not that whose spirit one violates by merely
associating it with the incapable the pretentious or the extravagant
but that which is at once the motive power and the inspiration of all
the actions of those who in their determination to force their way
through the great modern struggle for existence perseveringly follow a
line of conduct that they have worked out for themselves in advance
Ignoring such enterprises as they know to be unworthy of their powers
those who are possest of real poise and not of that foolish temerity
colloquially known as bluff will devote themselves solely to such
tasks as a wellordered judgment and an accurate knowledge of their own
potentialities indicate to them to be fitting
Does this mean that they will succeed in every case
Unfortunately no But such of them as have met with temporary failure
if they are able to assure themselves that their lack of success has
been due neither to a failure of willpower nor a fear of ridicule will
return to the charge once more prepared to make headway against
circumstances which they have the poise to foresee and which they will
at least render incapable of harming them even if they lack the
necessary force to dominate them completely to their own advantage
CHAPTER II
THE ENEMIES OF POISE
The enemies of poise are many and of different origins both of feeling
and of impulse
They all tend however toward the same result the cessation of effort
under pretexts more or less specious
It is of no use deceiving ourselves Lack of poise has its roots deep in
all the faults which are caused by apathy and purposeless variety
We have learned in the previous chapter how greatly the vice of lack of
confidence in oneself can retard the development of the quality we are
considering
Balanced between the desire to succeed and the fear of failure the
timid man leads a miserable existence tortured by unavailing regrets
and by no less useless aspirations which torment him like the worm that
dieth not
Little by little the habit of physical inaction engenders a moral
inertia and the victim learns to fly from every opportunity of escaping
from his bondage
Very soon an habitual state of idleness takes possession of him and
causes him to avoid everything that tends to make action necessary
The dread of responsibility that might devolve upon him turns him aside
from every sort of endeavor and he passes his life in a hopeless and
sluggish inaction from a fear of drawing down upon himself reproaches
to which he might have to make answer or of being compelled to take part
in discussions which would involve the disturbing of his indolent
repose
Are we to suppose then that he finds real happiness in such a state of
things
Certainly not for this negative existence weighs upon him with all the
burden of a monotony that he feels powerless to throw off His own
mediocrity enrages him while the success of others fills him with
dismay
Nevertheless his weakness of character allows the hate of action to
speak more loudly to him than legitimate ambition and keeps him in a
state of obvious inferiority that of itself gives birth to numberless
new enemies who end by destroying him utterly
He is first attacked by slowness of comprehension the inevitable
consequence of that idleness that causes the cowardly to shun the
battle
Rather than combat influences from without he allows them daily to
assume a more prominent and a more definite place in his thoughts
His hatred of action says no to all initiative and he considers that he
has accomplished his whole duty toward society and toward himself when
he says Whats the use of undertaking this or that I havent a chance
of succeeding and it is therefore idle to invite defeat
So quickly does the change work that his mind from lack of proper
exercise rapidly reaches the condition where it can not voluntarily
comprehend any but the most simple affairs and goes to pieces when
confronted with occasions that call for reflection or reasoning which
he considers as the hardest kind of work
It is hardly a matter for astonishment therefore that under these
conditions effeminacy should take possession of a soul that has become
the sport of all the weaknesses that are born of a desire to avoid
exertion
We do not care to draw the picture of that case too often encountered in
which this moral defeat becomes changed into envy the feeling of
bitterness against all men the veritable hell of the man who has not
the power to make the effort that shall free him
Mental instability is the inevitable consequence of this state of
affairs
All brainactivity being regarded as a useless toil the man of timidity
never understands the depth of the questions he has not the courage to
discuss If he does talk of them it is with a bias rendered all the
more prejudiced by the fact that instead of expressing his ideas he
takes refuge in fortifying his heresies with arguments of which the
smallest discussion would demonstrate the worthlessness
This unwillingness to discuss conditions gives rise among people who are
deficient in poise to a special form of reasoning which causes them to
summarize in the most hurried fashion even the gravest events upon the
sole consideration that they are not asked to take part in them If by
any chance they are forced to be actors in these events the least
little incident assumes for them the most formidable proportions
It seems probable that this tendency to exaggerate everything with which
they come in contact is due solely to egoism It is certain at any rate
that egoism plays a large part in it but some portion of it is due to
the lack of observation that characterizes all people of timidity
The mental idleness and the instability of mind that we have already
considered render such people less inclined to consider with any degree
of care those things which do not touch them directly
At this stage it is no longer possible for them to feign ignorance in
order to avoid the trouble of thinking and they are only touched even
by the most personal matters to the extent that circumstances impose
upon them the necessity of thinking or of acting with reference to the
subject under consideration
The idea that they can no longer avoid the resolutions which must be
made and their fear of the consequences which may result from these
affect them to such a profound extent that the most insignificant of
occurrences immediately assumes for them an altogether incommensurate
importance
This state of mind is a notable foe of poise It is practically
impossible for a person under such conditions to believe that any
considerable effort he has made can have passed unperceived
This propensity to assign an exaggerated importance to personal affairs
develops egoism the avowed enemy of poise An egoist necessarily
assumes that the rest of the world attributes to his acts the importance
he himself assigns to them
This preoccupation does not fail to upset him It increases his
embarrassment and the fear of not appearing in the light in which he
wishes to be seen paralyzes him while the dread of what other people
may think prevents him from being himself
To this cause many otherwise inexplicable defeats must be assigned the
result of which is a renewed resentment against the world at large and
an ardent desire to avoid any further exposure to the chance of failure
A case in point is the man who becomes nervous while making a speech
starts to stammer and makes a lamentable failure of what began well
enough because he imagines that persons in the audience are making fun
of him
He has overheard a word or surprized a look neither of which had any
relation to him but so great is his egoism that he does not dream that
any one in the audience can be so lacking in taste as to be concerned
with anything but himself
Had this man in spite of his egoism been endowed with poise he would
have gone along calmly simply forcing himself to ignore all criticism
and to impress his very critics by his attitude and his eloquence But
his distrust of himself his mental instability his habitual weakness
of reasoning all these enemies of poise league themselves together to
inflict upon him a defeat of which the memory will only aggravate his
nervousness and his desire never to repeat such an unpleasant
experience
For the man who has no poise there is no snatching victory from defeat
His feeble willpower is completely routed and the effort involved in
