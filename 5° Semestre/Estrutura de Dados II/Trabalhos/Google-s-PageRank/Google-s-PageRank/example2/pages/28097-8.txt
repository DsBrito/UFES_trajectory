commanded by his father but he cannot laugh or cry because directed
to do so by the same authority There must be the conditions which
call forth smiles or tears So there must be the conditions which call
forth the full expression of thought both what is intellectual and
what is emotional This means that the subject shall be one of which
the writer knows something and in which he is interested that the
demands in the composition shall not be made a discouragement and
that the teacher shall be competent and enthusiastic inspiring in
each pupil a desire to say truly and adequately the best he thinks and
feels
These conditions cannot be realized while working with dead fragments
of language but they are realized while constructing living wholes of
composition It is not two decades ago when the pupil in drawing was
compelled to make straight lines until he made them all crooked The
pupil in manual training began by drawing intersecting lines on two
sides of a board then he drove nails into the intersections on one
side hoping that they would hit the corresponding points on the
other Now no single line or exercise is an end in itself it
contributes to some whole Under the old method the pupil did not care
or try to draw a straight line or to drive a nail straight but now
in order that he may realize the idea that lies in his mind he does
care and he does try so lines are drawn better and nails are driven
straighter than before In all training that combines intellect and
hand the principle has been recognized that the best work is done
when the pupils interest has been enlisted by making each exercise
contribute directly to the construction of some whole Only in the
range of the spiritual are we twenty years behind time trying to get
the best construction by compulsion It is quite time that we
recognized that the best work in composition can be done not while
the pupil is correcting errors in the use of language which he never
dreamed of nor while he is writing ten similes or ten periodic
sentences but when both intellect and feeling combine and work
together to produce some whole Then into the construction of this
whole the pupil will throw all his strength using the most apt
comparisons choosing the best words framing adequate sentences in
order that the outward form may worthily present to others what to
himself has appeared worthy of expression
There are some persons who say that other languages are taught by the
word and sentence method then why not English These persons overlook
the fact that we are leaving that method as rapidly as possible and
adopting a more rational method which at once uses a language to
communicate thought And they overlook another fact of even greater
importance the pupil entering the high school is by no means a
beginner in English He has been using the language ten or twelve
years and has a fluency of expression in English which he cannot
attain in German throughout a high school and college course The
conditions under which a pupil begins the study of German in a high
school and the study of English composition are entirely dissimilar
and a conclusion based upon a fancied analogy is worthless
It is preferable then to practice the construction of wholes rather
than the making of exercises and it is best at the beginning to study
the different kinds of wholes one at a time rather than all
together No one would attempt to teach elimination by addition and
subtraction by comparison and by substitution all together nor
would an instructor take up heat light and electricity together In
algebra or physics certain great principles underlie the whole
subject and these appear and reappear as the study progresses through
its allied parts Still the best results are obtained by taking up
these several divisions of the whole one after another And in English
the most certain and definite results are secured by studying the
forms of discourse separately learning the method of applying to each
the great principles that underlie all composition
If the forms of discourse are to be studied one after another which
shall be taken up first In general all composition may be separated
into two divisions composition which deals with things including
narration and description and composition which deals with ideas
comprising exposition and argument It needs no argument to justify
the position that an essay which deals with things seen and heard is
easier for a beginner to construct than an essay which deals with
ideas invisible and unheard Whether narration or description should
precede appears yet to be undetermined for many textbooks treat one
first and perhaps as many the other I have thought it wiser to begin
with the short story because it is easier to gain free spontaneous
expression with narration than with description To write a whole page
of description is a task for a master and very few attempt it but
for the uninitiated amateur about three sentences of description mark
the limit of his ability to see and describe To get started to gain
confidence in ones ability to say something to acquire freedom and
spontaneity of expressionthis is the first step in the practice of
composition Afterward when the pupil has discovered that he really
has something to sayenough indeed to cover three or four pages of
his tablet paperthen it may be time to begin the study of
description and to acquire more careful and accurate forms of
expression Spontaneity should be acquired firstcrude and unformed
it may be but spontaneity first and this spontaneity is best gained
while studying narration
There can be but little question about the order of the other forms
Description still dealing with the concrete offers an admirable
opportunity for shaping and forming the spontaneous expression gained
in narration Following description in order of difficulty come
exposition and argument
I should be quite misunderstood did any one gather from this that
during the time in which wholes are being studied no attention is to
be given to parts that is to paragraphs sentences and words All
things cannot be learned at once and thoroughly there must be some
order of succession In the beginning the primary object to be aimed
at is the construction of wholes yet during their construction parts
can also be incidentally studied During this time many errors which
annoy and exasperate must be passed over with but a word in order
that the weight of the criticism may be concentrated on the point then
under consideration As a pupil advances he is more and more
competent to appreciate and to form good paragraphs and wellturned
sentences and to single out from the multitude of verbal signs the
word that exactly presents his thought The appreciation and the use
of the stronger as well as the finer and more delicate forms of
language come only with much reading and writing and to demand
everything at the very beginning is little less than sheer madness
Moreover there never comes a time when the construction of a
paragraph the shaping of a phrase or the choice of a word becomes an
end in itself Paragraphs sentences and words are well chosen when
they serve best the whole composition He who becomes enamored of one
form of paragraph who always uses periodic sentences who chooses
only common words has not yet recognized that the beauty of a phrase
or a word is determined by its fitness and that it is most beautiful
because it exactly suits the place it fills The graceful sweep of a
line by Praxiteles or the glorious radiancy of a color by Angelico is
most beautiful in the place it took from the masters hand So
Lowells wealth of figurative language and Stevensons unerring choice
of delicate words are most beautiful not when torn from their
original setting to serve as examples in rhetorics but when
fulfilling their part in a wellplanned whole And it is only as the
beauties of literature are born of the thought that they ever succeed
No one can say to himself I will now make a good simile and
straightway fulfill his promise If however the thought of a writer
takes fire and instead of the cold unimpassioned phraseology of the
logician glowing images crowd up and phrases tipped with fire then
figurative language best suits the thoughtindeed it is the
thought But imagery upon compulsionnever So that at no time
should one attempt to mould fine phrases for the sake of the phrases
themselves but he should spare no pains with them when they spring
from the whole when they harmonize with the whole and when they give
to the whole added beauty and strength
It is quite unnecessary at this day to urge the study of literature
It is in the course of study for every secondary school Yet a word
may be said of the value of this study to the practice of composition
There are two classes of artists geniuses and men of talent Of
geniuses in literature one can count the names on his fingers most
authors are simply men of talent Talent learns to do by doing and by
observing how others have done When Brunelleschi left Rome for
Florence he had closely observed and had drawn every arch of the
stupendous architecture in that ancient city and so he was adjudged
by his fellow citizens to be the only man competent to lift the dome
of their Duomo His observation discovered the secret of Romes
architectural grandeur and the slow accumulation of such secrets
marks the development of every art and science Milton had his method
of writing prose Macaulay his and Arnold hisall different and all
excellent And just as the architect stands before the cathedrals of
Cologne Milan and Salisbury to learn the secret of each as the
painter searches out the secret of Raphael Murillo and Rembrandt so
the author analyzes the masterpieces of literature to discover the
secret of Irving of Eliot and of Burke Not that an author is to be
a servile imitator of any mans manner but that having knowledge of
all the secrets of composition he shall so be enabled to set forth
for others his own thought in all the beauty and perfection in which
he himself conceives it
One thing further A landscape painter would not make a primary study
of Angelos anatomical drawings a composer of lyric forms of music
would not study Sousas marches nor would a person writing a story
look for much assistance in the arguments of Burke The most direct
benefit is derived from studying the very thing one wishes to know
about not from studying something else That the literature may give
the greatest possible assistance to the composition the course has
been so arranged that narration shall be taught by Hawthorne and
Irving description by Ruskin and Stevenson exposition by Macaulay
and Newman and argument by Webster and Burke Literature arranged in
this manner is not only a stimulus to renewed effort by showing what
others have done it is also the most skillful instructor in the art
of composition by showing how others have done
It would be quite impossible for any one at the present time to write
a textbook in English that would not repeat what has already been
said by many others Nor have I tried to My purpose has been rather
to select from the whole literature of the subject just those
principles which every author of a book on composition or rhetoric has
thought essential and to omit minor matters and all those about which
there is a difference of opinion This limits the contents to topics
already familiar to every teacher It also makes it necessary to
repeat what has been written before many times Certain books
however have treated special divisions of the whole subject in a
thorough and exhaustive manner There is nothing new to say of Unity
Mass and Coherence Mr Wendell said all concerning these in his book
entitled English Composition So in paragraph development Scott and
Denney hold the field Other books which I have frequently used in the
classroom are Talks on Writing English by Arlo Bates and Genungs
Practical Rhetoric These books I have found very helpful in
teaching and I have drawn upon them often while writing this
textbook
If the field has been covered then why write a book at all The
answer is that the principles which are here treated have not been put
into one book They may be found in several These essentials I have
repeated many times with the hope that they will be fixed by this
frequent repetition The purpose has been to focus the attention upon
these to apply them in the construction of the different forms of
discourse paragraphs and sentences and to repeat them until it is
impossible for a student to forget them If the book fulfils this
purpose it was worth writing

A COURSE OF STUDY
IN LITERATURE AND COMPOSITION
The Course of Study which follows is presented not because it is
better than many others which might be made For the purposes of this
book it was necessary that some course be adopted as the basis of the
text The principles which guided in arranging this course I believe
are sound but the preferences of teachers and the peculiarities of
environment will often make it wise to use other selections from
literature Of this a large supplementary list is given at the back
of the book
It is now a generally accepted truth that the study of English should
continue through the four years of a highschool course The division
of time that seems best is to take Narration and Description in the
first year In connection with Description Figures of Speech should
be studied The next year Exposition and Paragraphs form the major
part of the work This may be pleasantly broken by a study of Poetry
following the outline in the chapter on Verse Forms In the third
year while the work in literature is mainly the Novel and the Drama
Sentences and Words should be studied in composition with a review of
the chapters on Narration and Description Towards the close of the
year Exposition should be reviewed and the study of Argument taken
up The fourth year should be devoted to the study of such College
Requirements as have not been taken in the course and to the study of
the History of English Literature as given in some good text book
In some instances it will be found impossible to give so much time to
the study of English In such cases the amount of literature to be
studied should be decreased and the work in the text book should be
more rapidly done The sequence of the parts should remain the same
but the time should be modified to suit the needs of any special
environment
