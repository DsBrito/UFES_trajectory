COPEMAN  PINHEYS LIFE RAFTS
The experiments with life saving appliances which Mr Copeman brought
before the delegates of the Colonial Conference on the 13th April at
the Westminster Aquarium had a particular interest due to the late and
lamentable accident which befell the NewhavenDieppe passenger steamer
Victoria In many cases of this nature loss of life must rather be
attributed to panic than to a want of life saving appliances but as a
general rule an abundant supply of such apparatus will tend to give
passengers confidence and prevent the outbreak of such discreditable
scenes on the part of passengers as took place on the Victoria
Illustration FIG 1COPEMAN  PINHEYS LIFE RAFTS
Messrs Copeman  Pinhey have for some years past done good work in
this direction and at the recent meeting of the Institution of Naval
Architects Mr Copeman showed several models of the latest types of
their life saving apparatus both for use on torpedo boats and passenger
steamers Our illustration Fig 1 represents the kind of rafts supplied
to her Majestys troop ships while Figs 2 and 3 show deck seats
convertible into rafts which are intended for ordinary passenger
steamers The raft shown in Fig 1 consists of two pontoons joined by
strong cross beams and fitted with mast sail and oars When not in
use the pontoons form deck seats covered by a wooden grating which in
our illustration forms the middle part of the raft Each pontoon has a
compartment for storing provisions and when rigged as a raft there is a
railing to prevent persons being washed overboard

The seat life buoy shown in Fig 2 serves as an ordinary deck seat
being about 8 ft long and it consists of two portions hinged at the
back When required for use as a life buoy it is simply thrown forward
the seat being at the same time lifted upward so that the top rail of
the back engages with the two clips shown at either end of the seat and
the whole structure then forms a rigid raft as will be seen from Fig 3
Several other appliances were shown at the Westminster Aquarium on April
13 but the two rafts we have selected for illustration will give a
sufficiently correct idea of the general principles upon which the
apparatus is basedIndustries
ANOTHER REMARKABLE TORPEDO BOATOVER TWENTYEIGHT MILES AN HOUR
In a recent impression we gave some particulars of the trial trip of a
boat built for the Italian government by Messrs Yarrow  Co which
attained the highest speed known namely as nearly as possible 28 miles
an hour On the 14th April the sister boat made her trial trip in the
Lower Hope beating all previous performances and attaining a mean speed
of 25101 knots or over 28 miles an hour The quickest run made with the
tide was at the rate of 27272 knots or 3144 miles per hour past the
shore This is a wonderful performance
In the following table we give the precise results

The boat is 140 ft long and fitted with twin screws driven by compound
engines one pair to each propeller These engines are of the usual type
constructed by Messrs Yarrow Each has two cylinders with cranks at 90
The framing and indeed every portion not of phosphorbronze or gun
metal is of steel extraordinary precautions being taken to secure
lightness Thus the connecting rods have holes drilled through them from
end to end The low pressure cylinders are fitted with slide valves The
high pressure valves are of the piston type all being worked by the
ordinary link motion and eccentrics The engine room is not far from the
mid length of the boat and one boiler is placed ahead and the other
astern of it Each boiler is so arranged that it will supply either
engine or both at pleasure The boat has therefore two funnels one
forward and the other aft and air is supplied to the furnaces by two
fans one fixed on the forward and the other on the aft bulkhead of the
engine room
The fan engines have cylinders 512 in diameter and 312 in stroke and
make about 1100 revolutions per minute when at full speed causing a
plenum in the stokeholes of about 6 in water pressure Double steam
steering gear is fitted for the forward and aft rudder respectively and
safety from foundering is provided to an unusual degree by the
subdivision of the hull into numerous compartments each of which is
fitted with a huge ejector capable of throwing overboard a great body of
water A body of water equal to the whole displacement of the boat can be
discharged in less than seven minutes There is also a centrifugal pump
provided which can draw from any compartment The circulating pump is
not available because it has virtually no existence a very small pump
on the same shaft as the centrifugal being used merely to drain the
condensers These last are of copper cylindrical and fitted with pipes
through which a tremendous current of water is set up by the passage of
the boat through the sea Thus the space and weight due to a circulating
pump is saved and complication avoided The air and feed pumps are
combined in one casting let into the engine room floor quite out of the
way and worked by a crank pin in a small disk on the forward end of the
propeller shaft This is an admirable arrangement and works to
perfection
The armament of the boat consists of two torpedo tubes in her bows and a
second pair set at a small angle to eachYarrows patentcarried aft on
a turntable for broadside firing There are also two quick firing 3 lb
guns on her deck The conning tower forward is rifle proof and beneath
it and further forward is fixed the steering engine and a compressing
engine by which air is compressed for starting the torpedoes overboard
and for charging their reservoirs A small dynamo and engine are also
provided for working a search light if necessary The accommodation
provided for the officers and crew is far in advance of anything hitherto
found on board a torpedo boat
The weather on the morning of Thursday April 14 was anything rather
than that which would be selected for a trial or indeed any trip on the
Thames At 11 AM the hour at which the boat was to leave Messrs
Yarrows yard Isle of Dogs the wind was blowing in heavy squalls from
the northeast accompanied by showers of snow and hail The Italian
government was represented by Count Gandiani and several officers and
engineers In all there were about thirtythree persons on board The
displacement of the vessel was as nearly as might be 97 tons A start was
made down the river at 1115 AM the engines making about 180
revolutions per minute and the boat running at some 1112 or 12 knots
During this time the stokehole hatches were open but the fans were kept
running at slow speed to maintain a moderate draught The fuel used
throughout the trip was briquettes made of the best Welsh anthracite
worked up with a little tar The briquettes were broken up to convenient
sizes before being put in the bunkers This fuel is not of so high
evaporative efficiency as Nixons navigation coal but it is more
suitable for torpedo boat work because it gives out Very little dust
while the coal in closed stokeholes half smothers the firemen Watering
only partially mitigates the evil Besides this the patent fuel does not
clinker the tube endsa matter of vital importance
During the run down to Gravesend the small quantity of smoke given out
was borne down and away from the tops of the funnels by the fierce head
wind and now and then a heavy spray broke on the bows wetting
everything forward In the engine room preparations were made for taking
indicator diagrams No attempt was made to drive the boat fast because
high speeds are prohibited by the river authorities on account of the
heavy swell set up
The measured mile on the Lower Hope is on the southern bank of the river
about three miles below Gravesend Just as the boat passed the town in
the midst of a heavy rain squall the stokehole hatches in the deck were
shut and the dull humming roar of the fans showed that the fires were
being got up The smoke no longer rose leisurely from the funnels It
came up now with a rush and violence which showed the powerful agency at
work below A rapid vibrating motion beneath the feet was the first
evidence that the engines were away full speed As the boat gathered way
she seemed to settle down to her work and the vibration almost ceased
The measured mile was soon reached and then in the teeth of the
northeaster she tore through the water The tide and wind were both
against her Had the tide and wind been opposed there would have been a
heavy sea on As it was there was quite enough the water breaking on
her port bow came on board in sheets sparkling in the sun which the
rain squall having passed shone out for the moment As the wind was
blowing at least thirty miles an hour and the boat was going at some
twentysix miles an hour against it the result was a moderate hurricane
on board It was next to impossible to stand up against the fury of the
blast without holding on The mile was traversed in less than 212 minutes
however but the boat had to continue her course down the river for
nearly another mile to avoid some barges which lay in the way and
prevented her from turning Then the helm was put over and she came
round There was no slacking of the engines and astern of her the water
leaped from her rudder in a great upheaved foaming mass some 7 ft or 8
ft high Brought round she once more lay her course This time the wind
was on her starboard quarter or still more nearly aft The boat went
literally as fast as the wind and on deck it was nearly calm The light
smoke from the funnels no longer beaten down by wind leaped up high
into the air Looking over the side it was difficult to imagine that the
boat was passing through water at all The enormous velocity gave the
surface of the river the appearance of a sheet of steel for 1 ft or more
outside the boat Standing right aft the sight was yet more remarkable
Although two 6 ft screws were revolving at nearly 400 revolutions per
minute almost under foot not a bubble of air came up to break the
surface There was no wave in her wake about 70 ft behind her rose a
gentle swelling hill
Her wake was a broad smooth brown path cut right through the rough
surface of the river On each side of this path rose and broke the angry
little seas lashed up by the scourging wind Along the very center of the
brown track ran a thin ridge of sparkling foam some 2 ft high and some
20 ft long caused by the rudder being dragged through the water There
was scarcely any vibration The noise was not excessive A rapid whirr
due to the engines and a rythmical clatter due to the relief valve on
one of the port engine cylinders not being screwed down hard enough and
therefore lifting a little in its seat at each stroke made the most of
it The most prominent noise perhaps was the hum of the fans Standing
forward the deck seems to slope away downward aft as indeed it does
for it is to be noted that at these high speeds the forefoot of the boat
is always thrown up clean out of the waterand the whole aspect of the
boat the funnels vomiting thin brown smoke and occasionally when a
fire door is opened a lurid pillar of flame for a moment the whirr in
the engine room the dull thunder of the fans produce an impression on
the mind not easily expressed and due in some measure no doubt to the
exhilaration caused by the rapid motion through the air
The best way to convey what we mean is to say that the whole craft seems
to be alive and a perfect demon of energy and strength Many persons
hold that a torpedo boat is likely to be more useful in terrifying an
enemy than in doing him real harm and we can safely say that the captain
of an ironclad who saw half a dozen of these vessels bearing down on him
and did not wish himself well out of a scrape has more nerve than most
men
The second mile was run in far less time than that in which what we have
written concerning it can be read and then the boat turned again and
once more the head wind with all its discomforts was encountered Events
repeated themselves and so at last the sixth trip was completed and the
boat proceeded at a leisurely pace back again to Poplar Mr Crohn
representing Messrs Yarrow on board and all concerned might well feel
satisfied We had traveled at a greater speed than had ever before been
reached by anything that floats and there was no hitch or impediment or
trouble of any kind
The Italian government may be congratulated on possessing the two fastest
and most powerful torpedo boats in the world We believe however that
Messrs Yarrow are quite confident that with twin screw triple expansion
engines they can attain a speed of 26 knots an hour and we have no
reason to doubt thisThe Engineer
RESERVOIR DAMS
Footnote Paper with slight abbreviation read by Mr David Gravell
Assoc M Inst CE before the Society of Civil and Mechanical
Engineers The paper brings together in a convenient form the sections
and salient facts concerning many dams It was illustrated by numerous
diagrams from which our engravings have been preparedThe Engineer
By DAVID GRAVELL
The construction of dams in some form or other may probably rank among
the very earliest of engineering works Works of this character are not
infrequently referred to in the accounts of the earliest historians but
it is to be feared that they are not always perfectly trustworthy The
subscribers to the Mudie of the period had to be considered and their
taste for the marvelous was probably not much inferior to that of our own
day When therefore Herodotus describes the reservoir of Moeris as
formed for the control of the river floods of Nilenourished Egypt and
of another constructed by Nebuchadnezzar at Sippara of 140 miles in
circumference we must make allowances But there is no question as to
the existence in the East at the present day and especially in India and
Ceylon of the remains of what may correctly be termed stupendous works
and the date of the construction of which as regards India is in many
cases prehistoric In Spain also the Moors whose occupation of the
peninsula terminated in the thirteenth century have left reservoir dams
of great magnitude situated mostly in the southeastern provinces of
Murcia and Alicante and many of which are still serviceable
In India and Ceylon the greater number of the ancient dams or bunds are
now in ruins and this can occasion but little surprise considering the
meteorological condition of these countries In Ceylon for instance the
whole rainfall of the year occurs within a period of six to eight weeks
and often amounts to as much as 12 in in the twentyfour hours and has
been known comparatively recently to reach nearly 19 in the latter an
amount only 2 in or 3 in less than the average rainfall of Lincolnshire
for the whole year In London it is only 25 in and in the wettest
district in Great Britain viz Cumberland averages not more than 70
in per annum
The rainfall in Bombay is from 80 in to 100 in per annum and
throughout India may be taken as from 50 in to 130 in varying as is
the general rule in direct ratio with the altitude and limited to a few
weeks in the year Notwithstanding this there still exist in the Madras
Presidency a not inconsiderable number of ancient bunds which serve their
intended purpose at the present day as well as ever Slight mistakes did
occasionally occur as they ever will till no more dams are wanted as is
proved by the remains of some works in Ceylon where the failure was
evidently due to error possibly due to the instruments being out of
adjustment as their base is at a higher level than the bed of the stream
at the point where water from the latter was to be diverted to afford the
supply
Among the most remarkable of these ancient works is the HorraBera tank
the bund of which is between three and four miles in length and from 50
to 70 ft in height and although now in ruins would formerly impound a
reservoir lake of from eight to ten miles long and three to four miles
broad There is also the KalaWeva tank with a bund of twelve miles in
length which would if perfect create a lake of forty miles in
circumference Both of these ruined works are situated in Ceylon The
third embankment of a similar character is that of the Cummum tank
situated in the Madras Presidency and which though ranking among the
earliest works of Hindoo history is still in such a condition as to
fulfill its original intention The area of the reservoir is about
fifteen square miles the dam about 102 ft high with a breadth at the
crest of 76 ft and of the section shown in the diagram
The bywash is cut in the solid rock altogether clear of the dam the
outlet culverts however are carried under the bank We will now
consider generally the methods employed in determining the site
dimensions and methods of construction of reservoir dams adapted to the
varying circumstances and requirements of modern times with a few
references to some of the more important works constructed or in
progress which it will be endeavored to make as concise and burdened
with as few enumerations of dimensions as possible
The amount of the supply of water required and the purposes to which it
is to be applied whether for household manufacturing or irrigation
uses are among the first considerations affecting the choice of the site
of the reservoir and is governed by the amount of rainfall available
after deducting for evaporation and absorption and the nature of the
surface soil and vegetation The next important point is to determine the
position of the dam having regard to the suitability of the ground for
affording a good foundation and the impoundment of the requisite body of
water with the least outlay on embankment works
It has been suggested that the floods of the valley of the Thames might
be controlled by a system of storage reservoirs and notice was
especially drawn to this in consequence of the heavy floods of the winter
of 1875 From evidence given before the Royal Commission on Water Supply
previous to that date it was stated that a rainfall of 1 in over the
Thames basin above Kingston would give omitting evaporation and
absorption a volume of 53375000000 gallons To prevent floods a
rainfall of at least 3 in would have to be provided against which would
mean the construction of reservoirs of a storage capacity of say
160000000000 gallons Mr Bailey Denton in his evidence before that
commission estimated that reservoirs to store less than one tenth that
quantity would cost 1360000 and therefore a 3 in storage as above
would require an outlay of say 15000000 sterling and it will be
seen that 3 in is by no means too great a rainfall to allow for as in
July of 1875 according to Mr Symons at Cirencester 311 in fell
within twentyfour hours Supposing serious attention were to be given to
such a scheme there would without doubt be very great difficulty in
finding suitable situations from an engineering and land owners point
of view for the requisite dams and reservoir areas
In Great Britain and many European countries rain gauges have been
established at a greater or less number of stations for many years past
and data thereby afforded for estimating approximately the rainfall of
any given district or catchment basin The term watershed is one which
it appears to me is frequently misapplied as I understand it watershed
is equivalent to what in America is termed the divide and means the
boundary of the catchment area or basin of any given stream although I
believe it is frequently made use of as meaning the catchment area
itself When saying that the rain gauges already established in most of
the older civilized countries afford data for an approximate estimate
only it is meant that an increase in the number of points at which
observations are made is necessary previous to the design of a reservoir
dam on the catchment area above the waters of which are proposed to be
impounded and should be continuous for a series of five or six years
and these must be compared with the observations made with the old
established rain gauges of the adjacent district say for a period of
twenty years previously and modified accordingly This is absolutely
necessary before an accurate estimate of the average and maximum and
minimum rainfall can be arrived at as the rainfall of each square mile
of gathering ground may vary the amount being affected by the altitude
and the aspect as regards the rainy quarter
But this information will be of but little service to the engineer
without an investigation of the loss due to evaporation and absorption
varying with the season of the year and the more or less degree of
saturation of the soil the amount of absorption depending upon the
character of the ground dip of strata etc the hydrographic area
being as a rule by no means equal to the topographic area of a given
basin From this cursory view of the preliminary investigations necessary
can be realized what difficulties must attend the design of dams for
reservoirs in newly settled or uncivilized countries where there are no
data of this nature to go on and where if maps exist they are probably
of the roughest description and uncontoured so that before any project
can be even discussed seriously special surveys have to be made the
results of which may only go to prove the unsuitability of the site under
consideration as regards area etc The loss due to evaporation
according to Mr Hawksley in this country amounts to a mean of about 15
in this and the absorption must vary with the geological conditions
and therefore to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion regarding the amount
of rainfall actually available for storage careful gaugings have to be
made of the stream affected and these should extend over a lengthened
period and be compounded with the rainfall A certain loss of water in
times of excessive floods must in designing a dam be ever expected
and under favorable conditions may be estimated at 10 per cent of the
total amount impounded
As regards the choice of position for the dam of a reservoir supposing
that it is intended to impound the water by throwing an obstruction
across a valley it may be premised that to impound the largest quantity
of water with the minimum outlay the most favorable conditions are
present where a more or less broad valley flanked by steep hills suddenly
narrows at its lower end forming a gorge which can be obstructed by a
comparatively short dam The accompanying condition is that the nature of
the soil ie the character strata and lie of the rock clay etc
as the case may be is favorable to assuring a good foundation In Great
Britain as a rule dams for reservoirs have been constructed of
earthwork with a puddle core deemed by the majority of English engineers
as more suitable for this purpose than masonry
Earthwork in some instances combined with masonry was also a form usual
in the ancient works of the East already referred to but it would
appear from the experience of recent years that masonry dams are likely
to become as common as those of earthwork especially in districts
favorable to the construction of the former where the natural ground is
of a rocky character and good stone easily obtained
As to the stability of structures of masonry for this purpose as
compared with earthwork experience would seem to leave the question an
open one Either method is liable to failure and there certainly are as
many cases on record of the destruction of masonry dams as there are of
those constructed of earthwork as instanced in Algeria within the past
few years As regards masonry dams the question of success does not seem
so much to depend upon their design as far as the mere determination of
the suitable profile or cross section is concerned as that has been very
exhaustively investigated and fairly agreed upon from a mathematical
point of view but to be principally due to the correctness of the
estimate of the floods to be dealt with and a sufficient provision of
bywash allowed for the most extreme cases and lastly perhaps the most
important of all the securing a thoroughly good foundation and a
careful execution of the work throughout
These remarks equally apply to earthwork dams as regards sufficient
provision of bywash careful execution of work and security of
foundation but their area of cross section supposing them to be
watertight on account of the flatness of their slopes and consequent
breadth of base is of course far in excess of that merely required for
stability but in these latter the method adopted for the water supply
discharge is of the very greatest importance and will be again referred
to
Before commencing the excavation for the foundations of a dam it is most
essential that the character of the soil or rock should be examined
carefully by sinking a succession of small shafts not mere borings
along the site so that the depth to which the trench will have to be
carried and the amount of ground water likely to be encountered can be
reliably ascertained as this portion of the work cannot be otherwise
estimated and as it may bear a very large proportion of the total
expense of construction and in certain cases may demonstrate that the
site is altogether unsuitable for the proposed purpose
The depth to which puddle trenches have been carried for the purpose of
penetrating waterbearing strata and reaching impenetrable ground in
some cases has been as much as 160 ft below the natural surface of the
ground and the expense of timbering pumping and excavation in such an
instance can be easily imagined This may be realized by referring to
Fig 4 giving a crosssection of the Yarrow dam in which the bottom of
the trench is there only 85 ft below the ground surface In the Dale
Dyke dam Fig 2 the bottom of the trench was about 50 ft below the
ground surface
There is one other point which should be mentioned in connection with the
form of the base of the puddle trenchthat instead of cutting the bottom
of the trench at the sides of the valley in steps it should be merely
sloped so that the puddle in setting tends to slide down each inclined
plane toward the bottom of valley thereby becoming further compressed
whereas should the natural ground be cut in steps the puddle in setting
tends to bulge at the side of each riser as it may be termed and so
cause fissures It will be noticed that the slopes of these earthwork
dams vary from 7 to 1 to 2 to 1
The depths to which some puddle trenches are carried has been objected to
by some engineers and among them Sir Robert Rawlinson as excessive and
unnecessary and in the opinion of the latter the same end might be
obtained by going down to a depth say of 30 ft only and putting in a
thick bed of concrete and also carrying up the concrete at the back of
the puddle trench with a well for collecting water and a pipe leading
the same off through the back of the dam to the down stream side An
arrangement of this kind is shown in the Yarrow dam Fig 4
The thickness of the puddle wall varies considerably in the different
examples given in the diagrams before you a fair average being the Row
bank of the Paisley Water Works Fig 6 and although in instances of
dams made early in the century such as the Glencorse damFig 5of the
Edinburgh Water Works the puddle was of very considerable thickness and
it would appear rightly so This practice does not seem to have been
followed in many cases as for instance again referring to the Dale
Dyke dam Fig 2 where the thickness of the top was only 4 ft with a
batter of 1 in 16 downward giving a thickness of 16 ft at the base For
a dam 95 ft in height this is very light compared with that of the
Vehui dam at Bombay of which the engineer was Mr ConybeareFig
7where the puddle wall is 10 ft wide at the top with a batter
downward of 1 in 8 the Bann reservoirFig 8of Mr Batemans design
where the puddle is 8 ft broad at the top and other instances The same
dimension was adopted for the puddle wall of the Harelaw reservoir at
Paisley by Mr Alexander Leslie an engineer of considerable experience
in dam construction
There appears to be a question as to what the composition of puddle
should be some advocating a considerable admixture of gravel with clay
There is no doubt that clay intended for puddle should be exposed to the
weather for as long previous to use as possible and subject to the
action of the air at any rate of sunshine if there be any or of frost
When deposited in the trench it should be spread in layers of not more
than 6 in in thickness cut transversely in both directions thoroughly
watered and worked by stamping
The position of the puddle wall is as a rule in the center of the bank
and vertical but laying a thickness of puddle upon the inner or up
stream slope say 3 ft thick protected by a layer of gravel and
pitching has been advocated as preventing any portion of the dam from
becoming saturated There are however evident objections to this
method as the puddle being comparatively unprotected would be more
liable to damage by vermin such as water rats etc and in case of the
earthwork dam at the back settling as would certainly be the case
unless its construction extended over a very lengthened period the
puddle would be almost certain to become fissured and leaky in addition
the comparative amounts of puddle used in this manner as compared with
the vertical wall would be so much increased With the puddle wall in
the position usually adopted unequal settlement of the bank on either
side is less liable to affect the puddle being vertical
It would be interesting to refer to the embankment of the Bann or Lough
Island Reavy reservoir Fig 8 designed by Mr Bateman now nearly fifty
years ago where a layer of peat was adopted both on the slope 15 in
thick and in front or on the up stream side of the puddle wall 3 ft
thick The object was that should the puddle become fissured and leaky
the draught so created would carry with it particles of peat which would
choke up the cracks and so reduce the leakage that the alluvial matter
would gradually settle over it and close it up On the same diagram will
be noticed curved lines which are intended to delineate the way in which
the earthwork of the embankment was made up The layers were 3 ft in
thickness laid in the curved layers as indicated
It is a moot question whether in making an earthwork embankment
dependence as far as stanchness is concerned should be placed upon the
puddle wall alone or upon the embankments on either side and especially
upon the upstream side in addition Supposing the former idea prevails
then it can be of little moment as to how or of what material the bank on
either side is made upwhether of earth or stoneplaced in thin layers
or tipped in banks of 3 ft or 4 ft high but the opinion of the
majority of engineers seems to be in favor of making the banks act not
