PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN ROME
CHAPTER I
THE TRANSFORMATION OF ROME FROM A PAGAN INTO A CHRISTIAN CITY1
The early adoption of Christianity not confined to the poorer
classesInstances of Roman nobles who were ChristiansThe
family of the Acilii GlabrionesManius Acilius the consulPut
to death because of his religionDescription of his tomb
recently discoveredOther Christian patriciansHow was it
possible for men in public office to serve both Christ and
CsarThe usual liberality of the emperors towards the new
religionNevertheless an open profession of faith hazardous and
frequently avoidedMarriages between Christians and
pagansApostasy resulting from theseCurious discovery
illustrating the attitude of Senecas family towards
ChristianityChristians in the armyThe gradual nature of the
transformation of RomeThe significance of the inscription on
the Arch of ConstantineThe readiness of the early Church to
adopt pagan customs and even mythsThe curious mixture of pagan
and Christian conceptions which grew out of thisChurches
became repositories for classical works of art for which new
interpretations were inventedThe desire of the early
Christians to make their churches as beautiful as possibleThe
substitution of Christian shrines for the old pagan altars at
street cornersExamples of bothThe bathing accommodations of
the pagan temples adopted by the ChurchAlso the custom of
providing public standards of weights and measuresThese set up
in the basilicasHow their significance became perverted in the
Dark AgesThe adoption of funerary banquets and their
degenerationThe public storehouses of the emperors and those
of the popesPagan rosefestivals and their conversion into a
Christian institution
It has been contended and many still believe that in ancient Rome
the doctrines of Christ found no proselytes except among the lower
and poorer classes of citizens That is certainly a noble picture
which represents the new faith as searching among the haunts of
poverty and slavery seeking to inspire faith hope and charity in
their occupants to transform them from things into human beings to
make them believe in the happiness of a future life to alleviate
their present sufferings to redeem their children from shame and
servitude to proclaim them equal to their masters But the gospel
found its way also to the mansions of the masters nay even to the
palace of the Csars The discoveries lately made on this subject are
startling and constitute a new chapter in the history of imperial
Rome We have been used to consider early Christian history and
primitive Christian art as matters of secondary importance and hardly
worthy the attention of the classical student Thus none of the four
or five hundred volumes on the topography of ancient Rome speaks of
the basilicas raised by Constantine of the church of S Maria
Antiqua built side by side with the Temple of Vesta the two worships
dwelling together as it were for nearly a century of the Christian
burialgrounds of the imperial mausoleum near S Peters of the
porticoes several miles in length which led from the centre of the
city to the churches of S Peter S Paul and S Lorenzo of the
palace of the Csars transformed into the residence of the Popes Why
should these constructions of monumental and historical character be
expelled from the list of classical buildings and why should we
overlook the fact that many great names in the annals of the empire
are those of members of the Church especially when the knowledge of
their conversion enables us to explain events that had been up to the
latest discoveries shrouded in mystery
It is a remarkable fact that the record of some of these events should
be found not in church annals calendars or itineraries but in
passages in the writings of pagan annalists and historians Thus in
ecclesiastical documents no mention is made of the conversion of the
two Domitill or Flavius Clemens or Petronilla all of whom were
relatives of the Flavian emperors and of the Acilii Glabriones the
noblest among the noble as Herodianus calls them 2 3 Their
fortunes and death are described only by the Roman historians and
biographers of the time of Domitian It seems that when the official
feriale or calendar was resumed after the end of the
persecutions preference was given to names of those confessors and
martyrs whose deeds were still fresh in the memory of the living and
of necessity little attention was paid to those of the first and
second centuries whose acts either had not been written down or had
been lost during the persecutions
As the crypt of the Acilii Glabriones on the Via Salaria has become
one of the chief places of attraction since its rediscovery in 1888
I cannot begin this volume under better auspices than by giving an
account of this important event2
In exploring that portion of the Catacombs of Priscilla which lies
under the Monte delle Gioie near the entrance from the Via Salaria
de Rossi observed that the labyrinth of the galleries converged
towards an original crypt shaped like a Greek Greek G Gamma and
decorated with frescoes The desire of finding the name and the
history of the first occupants of this noble tomb whose memory seems
to have been so dear to the faithful led the explorers to carefully
sift the earth which filled the place and their pains were rewarded
by the discovery of a fragment of a marble coffin inscribed with the
letters ACILIO GLABRIONI FILIO
Illustration Tablet of Acilius Glabrio
Did this fragment really belong to the Greek G crypt or had it
been thrown there by mere chance And in case of its belonging to the
crypt was it an isolated record or did it belong to a group of
graves of the Acilii Glabriones The queries were fully answered by
later discoveries four inscriptions naming Manius Acilius  and
his wife Priscilla Acilius Rufinus Acilius Quintianus and Claudius
Acilius Valerius were found among the debris so that there is no
doubt as to the ownership of the crypt and of the chapel which opens

The Manii Acilii Glabriones attained celebrity in the sixth century of
Rome when Acilius Glabrio consul in 563 B C 191 conquered the
Macedonians at the battle of Thermopylai We have in Rome two records
of his career the Temple of Piety erected by him on the west side of
the Forum Olitorium now transformed into the church of S Nicola in
Carcere and the pedestal of the equestrian statue of gilt bronze
offered to him by his son the first of its kind ever seen in Italy
which was discovered by Valadier in 1808 at the foot of the steps of
the temple and buried again Towards the end of the republic we find
them established on the Pincian Hill where they had built a palace
and laid out gardens which extended at least from the convent of the
Trinita dei Monti to the Villa Borghese3 The family had grown so
rapidly to honor splendor and wealth that Pertinax in the
memorable sitting of the Senate in which he was elected emperor
proclaimed them the noblest race in the world
The Glabrio best known in the history of the first century is Manius
Acilius who was consul with Trajan A D 91 He was put to death by
Domitian in the year 95 as related by Suetonius Domit 10 He
caused several senators and exconsuls to be executed on the charge of
their conspiring against the empirequasi molitores rerum
novarumamong them Civica Cerealis governor of Asia Salvidienus
Orfitus and Acilius Glabrio who had previously been banished from
Rome
The expression molitores rerum novarum has a political meaning in
the case of Cerealis and Orfitus both staunch pagans and a religious
and political one in the case of Glabrio a convert to the Christian
faith called nova superstitio by Suetonius and Tacitus Other
details of Glabrios fate are given by Dion Cassius Juvenal and
Fronto We are told by these authors that during his consulship A D
91 and before his banishment he was compelled by Domitian to fight
against a lion and two bears in the amphitheatre adjoining the
emperors villa at Albanum The event created such an impression in
Rome and its memory lasted so long that half a century later we
find it given by Fronto as a subject for a rhetorical composition to
his pupil Marcus Aurelius The amphitheatre is still in existence and
was excavated in 1887 Like the one at Tusculum it is partly hollowed
out of the rocky side of the mountain partly built of stone and
rubble work It well deserves a visit from the student and the
tourist on account of its historical associations and of the
admirable view which its ruins command of the vineclad slopes of
Albano and Castel Savello the wooded plains of Ardea and Lavinium
the coast of the Tyrrhenian and the islands of Pontia and Pandataria
Xiphilinus states that in the year 95 some members of the imperial
family were condemned by Domitian on the charge of atheism together
with other leading personages who had embraced the customs and
persuasion of the Jews that is the Christian faith Manius Acilius
Glabrio the exconsul was implicated in the same trial and
condemned on the same indictment with the others Among these the
historian mentions Clemens and Domitilla who were manifestly
Christians One particular of the case related by Juvenal confirms
the account of Xiphilinus He says that in order to mitigate the wrath
of the emperor and avoid a catastrophe Acilius Glabrio after
fighting the wild beasts at Albanum assumed an air of stupidity In
this alleged stupidity it is easy to recognize the prejudice so common
among the pagans to whom the Christians retirement from the joys of
the world their contempt of public honors and their modest behavior
appeared as contemptissima inertia most despicable laziness This
is the very phrase used by Suetonius in speaking of Flavius Clemens
who was murdered by Domitian ex tenuissima suspicione on a very
slight suspicion of his faith

Glabrio was put to death in his place of exile the name of which is
not known His end helped no doubt the propagation of the gospel
among his relatives and descendants as well as among the servants and
freedmen of the house as shown by the noble sarcophagi and the
humbler loculi found in such numbers in the crypt of the Catacombs of
Priscilla The small oratory at the southern end of the crypt seems to
have been consecrated exclusively to the memory of its first occupant
the exconsul The date and the circumstances connected with the
translation of his relics from the place of banishment to Rome are
not known
Both the chapel and the crypt were found in a state of devastation
hardly credible as though the plunderers had taken pleasure in
satisfying their vandalic instincts to the utmost Each of the
sarcophagi was broken into a hundred pieces the mosaics of the walls
and ceiling had been wrenched from their sockets cube by cube the
marble incrustations torn off the altar dismantled the bones
dispersed
When did this wholesale destruction take place In times much nearer
ours than the reader may imagine I have been able to ascertain the
date with the help of an anecdote related by Pietro Sante Bartoli in
 144 of his archological memoirs Excavations were made under
Innocent X 16341655 and Clement IX 16671670 in the Monte
delle Gioie on the Via Salaria with the hope of discovering a
certain hidden treasure The hope was frustrated but deep in the
bowels of the mound some crypts were found encrusted with white
stucco and remarkable for their neatness and preservation I have
heard from trustworthy men that the place is haunted by spirits as is
proved by what happened to them not many months ago While assembled
on the Monte delle Gioie for a picnic the conversation turned upon
the ghosts who haunted the crypt below when suddenly the carriage
which had brought them there pushed by invisible hands began to roll
down the slope of the hill and was ultimately precipitated into the
river Anio at its base Several oxen had to be used to haul the
vehicle out of the stream This happened to Tabarrino butcher at S
Eustachio and to his brothers living in the Via Due Macelli whose
faces still bear marks of the great terror experienced that day
There is no doubt that the anecdote refers to the tomb of the Acilii
Glabriones which is cut under the Monte delle Gioie and is the only
one in the Catacombs of Priscilla remarkable for a coating of white
stucco Its destruction therefore took place under Clement IX and
was the work of treasurehunters And the very nature of clandestine
excavations which are the work of malicious ignorant and suspicious
persons explains the reason why no mention of the discovery was made
to contemporary archologists and the pleasure of rediscovering the
secret of the Acilii Glabriones was reserved for us
These are by no means the only patricians of high standing whose names
have come to light from the depths of the catacombs Tacitus Annal
xiii 32 tells how Pomponia Grcina wife of Plautius the conqueror
of Britain was accused of foreign superstition tried by her
husband and acquitted These words long since gave rise to a
conjecture that Pomponia Grcina was a Christian and recent
discoveries put it beyond doubt An inscription bearing the name of
Greek POMPONIOS GREKEINOS has been found in the Cemetery of
Callixtus together with other records of the Pomponii Attici and
Bassi Some scholars think that Grcina the wife of the conqueror of
Britain is no other than Lucina the Christian matron who interred
her brethren in Christ in her own property at the second milestone of
the Appian Way
Other evidence of the conquests made by the gospel among the
patricians is given by an inscription discovered in March 1866 in
the Catacombs of Prtextatus near the monument of Quirinus the
martyr It is a memorial raised to the memory of his departed wife by
Postumius Quietus consul A D 272 Here also was found the name of
Urania daughter of Herodes Atticus by his second wife Vibullia
Alcia4 while on the other side of the road near S Sebastiano a
mausoleum has been found on the architrave of which the name
URANIORUM is engraved
In chapter vii I shall have occasion to refer to many Christian
relatives of the emperors Vespasian and Domitian Eusebius in
speaking of these Flavians and particularly of Domitilla the younger
niece of Domitian quotes the authority of the historian Bruttius He
evidently means Bruttius Prsens the illustrious friend of Pliny the
younger and the grandfather of Crispina the empress of Commodus In
1854 near the entrance to the crypt of the Flavians at Torre
Marancia Via Ardeatina a fragment of a sarcophagus was found with
the name of Bruttius Crispinus If therefore the history of
Domitillas martyrdom was written by the grandfather of Bruttia
Crispina the empress it seems probable that the two families were
united not only by the close proximity of their villas and tombs and
by friendship but especially by community of religion
I may also cite the names of several Cornelii Ccilii and milii
the flower of Roman nobility grouped near the graves of S Ccilia
and Pope Cornelius of Liberalis a consul suffectus5 and a
martyr whose remains were buried in the Via Salaria of Jallia
Clementina a relative of Jallius Bassus consul before A D 161 of
Catia Clementina daughter or relative of Catius consul A D 230 not
to speak of personages of equestrian rank whose names have been
collected in hundreds
A difficulty may arise in the mind of the reader how was it possible
for these magistrates generals consuls officers senators and
governors of provinces to attend to their duties without performing
acts of idolatry In chapter xxxvii of the Apology Tertullian says
We are but of yesterday yet we fill every place that belongs to you
cities islands outposts we fill your assemblies camps tribes and
decuries the imperial palace the Senate the forum we only leave to
you your temples But here lies the difficulty how could they fill
these places and leave the temples
First of all the Roman emperors gave plenty of liberty to the new
religion from time to time and some of them moved by a sort of
religious syncretism even tried to ally it with the official worship
of the empire and to place Christ and Jupiter on the steps of the
same lararium The first attempt of the kind is attributed to
Tiberius he is alleged to have sent a message to the Senate
requesting that Christ should be included among the gods on the
strength of the official report written by Pontius Pilatus of the
passion and death of our Lord Malala says that Nero made honest
inquiries about the new religion and that at first he showed
himself rather favorable towards it a fact not altogether improbable
if we take into consideration the circumstances of Pauls appeal his
absolution and his relations with Seneca and with the converts de
domo Csaris of the house of Csar Lampridius speaking of the
religious sentiments of Alexander Severus says He was determined to
raise a temple to Christ and enlisted him among the gods a project
attributed also to Hadrian There is no doubt that Hadrian ordered
temples to be erected in every city to an unknown god and because
they have no statue we still call them temples of Hadrian He is said
to have prepared them for Christ but to have been deterred from
carrying his plan into execution by the consideration that the temples
of the old gods would become deserted and the whole population turn
Christian omnes christianos futuros6
The freedom enjoyed by the Church under Caracalla is proved by the
graffiti of the Domus Gelotiana described in my Ancient Rome7
The one caricaturing the crucifixion which is reproduced on p 122 of
that volume stands by no means alone in certifying to the spreading
of the faith in the imperial palace The name of Alexamenos the
faithful is repeated thrice There is also a name LIBANUS under
which another hand has written EPISCOPUS and lower down LIBANUS
EPISCOPUS It is very likely a joke on Libanus a Christian page
like Alexamenos whom his fellowdisciples had nicknamed the bishop
It is true that the title is not necessarily Christian having been
used sometimes to denote a municipal officer8 but this can hardly
be the case in an assembly of youths like the one of the Domus
Gelotiana and the connection between the graffiti of Libanus and
those of Alexamenos seems evident In reading these graffiti now
very much injured by dampness exposure and the unscrupulous hands of
tourists we are really witnessing household quarrels between pagan
and Christian dwellers in the imperial palace in one of which
Caracalla when still young saw one of his playmates struck and
punished on account of his Christian origin and persuasion
Septimius Severus and Caracalla issued a constitution9 which
opened to the Jews the way to the highest honors making the
performance of such ceremonies as were in opposition to the principles
of their faith optional with them What was granted to the Jews by the
law of the empire may have been permitted also to the Christians by
the personal benevolence of the emperors
When Elagabalus collected or tried to collect in his own private
chapel the gods and the holiest relics of the universe he did not
forget Christ and his doctrine10 Alexander Severus the best of
Roman rulers gave full freedom to the Church and once the
Christians having taken possession of a public place on which the
popinarii or tavernkeepers claimed rights Alexander gave
judgment in favor of the former saying it was preferable that the
place should serve for divine worship rather than for the sale of
drinks11

There can scarcely be any doubt that the emperor Philip the Arab
Marcus Julius Philippus A D 244 his wife Otacilia Severa and
his son Philip the younger were Christians and friends of S
Hippolytus Still in spite of these periods of peace and freedom of
the Church we cannot be blind to the fact that for a Christian
nobleman wishing to make a career the position was extremely
hazardous Hence we frequently see baptism deferred until mature or
old age and strange situations and even acts of decided apostasy
created by mixed marriages
The wavering between public honors and Christian retirement is
illustrated by some incidents in the life of Licentius a disciple of
S Augustine Licentius was the son of Romanianus a friend and
countryman of Augustine and when the latter retired to the villa of
Verecundus after his conversion in the year 386 Licentius who had
attended his lectures on eloquence at Milan followed him to his
retreat He appears as one of the speakers in the academic disputes
which took place in the villa12 In 396 Licentius who had followed
his master to Africa seduced by the hopes of a brilliant career
determined to settle in Rome Augustine deeply grieved at losing his
beloved pupil wrote to call him back and entreated him to turn his
