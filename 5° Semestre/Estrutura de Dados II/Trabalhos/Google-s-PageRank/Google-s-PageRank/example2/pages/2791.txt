and in another volume presently to follow there will be the voice of
Steele
The two friends differed in temperament and in many of the outward signs
of character but these two little books will very distinctly show how
wholly they agreed as to essentials  For Addison Literature had a charm
of its own he delighted in distinguishing the finer graces of good
style and he drew from the truths of life the principles of taste in
writing  For Steele Literature was the life itself he loved a true
book for the soul he found in it  So he agreed with Addison in judgment
But the six papers on Wit the two papers on Chevy Chase contained
in this volume the eleven papers on Imagination and the papers on
Paradise Lost which may be given in some future volume were in a form
of study for which Addison was far more apt than Steele  Thus as fellow
workers they gave a breadth to the character of Tatler and Spectator
that could have been produced by neither of them singly
The reader of this volume will never suppose that the artists pleasure
in good art and in analysis of its constituents removes him from direct
enjoyment of the life about him that he misses a real contact with all
the world gives that is worth his touch  Good art is but nature studied
with love trained to the most delicate perception and the good criticism
in which the spirit of an artist speaks is like Addisons calm simple
and benign  Pope yearned to attack John Dennis a rough critic of the
day who had attacked his Essay on Criticism  Addison had discouraged
a very small assault of words  When Dennis attacked Addisons Cato
Pope thought himself free to strike but Addison took occasion to
express through Steele a serious regret that he had done so  True
criticism may be affected as Addisons was by some bias in the canons
of taste prevalent in the writers time but as Addisons did in the
ChevyChase papers it will dissent from prevalent misapplications of
them and it can never associate perception of the purest truth and
beauty with petty arrogance nor will it so speak as to give pain  When
Wordsworth was remembering with love his mothers guidance of his
childhood and wished to suggest that there were mothers less wise in
their ways he was checked he said by the unwillingness to join thought
of her with any thought that looks at others blame  So Addison felt
towards his mother Nature in literature and in life  He attacked
nobody  With a light kindly humour that was never personal and never
could give pain he sought to soften the harsh lines of life abate its
follies and inspire the temper that alone can overcome its wrongs
Politics in which few then knew how to think calmly and recognise the
worth of various opinion Steele and Addison excluded from the pages of
the Spectator  But the first paper in this volume is upon Public
Credit and it did touch on the position of the country at a time when
the shock of change caused by the Revolution of 168889 and also the
strain of foreign war were being severely felt

CREECH
In one of my rambles or rather speculations I looked into the great
hall where the bank is kept and was not a little pleased to see the
directors secretaries and clerks with all the other members of that
wealthy corporation ranged in their several stations according to the
parts they act in that just and regular economy  This revived in my
memory the many discourses which I had both read and heard concerning the
decay of public credit with the methods of restoring it and which in
my opinion have always been defective because they have always been
made with an eye to separate interests and party principles
The thoughts of the day gave my mind employment for the whole night so
that I fell insensibly into a kind of methodical dream which disposed
all my contemplations into a vision or allegory or what else the reader
shall please to call it
Methoughts I returned to the great hall where I had been the morning
before but to my surprise instead of the company that I left there I
saw towards the upper end of the hall a beautiful virgin seated on a
throne of gold  Her name as they told me was Public Credit  The
walls instead of being adorned with pictures and maps were hung with
many Acts of Parliament written in golden letters  At the upper end of
the hall was the Magna Charta with the Act of Uniformity on the right
hand and the Act of Toleration on the left  At the lower end of the
hall was the Act of Settlement which was placed full in the eye of the
virgin that sat upon the throne  Both the sides of the hall were covered
with such Acts of Parliament as had been made for the establishment of
public funds  The lady seemed to set an unspeakable value upon these
several pieces of furniture insomuch that she often refreshed her eye
with them and often smiled with a secret pleasure as she looked upon
them but at the same time showed a very particular uneasiness if she
saw anything approaching that might hurt them  She appeared indeed
infinitely timorous in all her behaviour and whether it was from the
delicacy of her constitution or that she was troubled with vapours as I
was afterwards told by one who I found was none of her wellwishers she
changed colour and startled at everything she heard  She was likewise
as I afterwards found a greater valetudinarian than any I had ever met
with even in her own sex and subject to such momentary consumptions
that in the twinkling of an eye she would fall away from the most florid
complexion and the most healthful state of body and wither into a
skeleton  Her recoveries were often as sudden as her decays insomuch
that she would revive in a moment out of a wasting distemper into a
habit of the highest health and vigour
I had very soon an opportunity of observing these quick turns and changes
in her constitution  There sat at her feet a couple of secretaries who
received every hour letters from all parts of the world which the one or
the other of them was perpetually reading to her and according to the
news she heard to which she was exceedingly attentive she changed
colour and discovered many symptoms of health or sickness
Behind the throne was a prodigious heap of bags of money which were
piled upon one another so high that they touched the ceiling  The floor
on her right hand and on her left was covered with vast sums of gold that
rose up in pyramids on either side of her  But this I did not so much
wonder at when I heard upon inquiry that she had the same virtue in
her touch which the poets tell us a Lydian king was formerly possessed
of and that she could convert whatever she pleased into that precious
metal
After a little dizziness and confused hurry of thought which a man
often meets with in a dream methoughts the hall was alarmed the doors
flew open and there entered half a dozen of the most hideous phantoms
that I had ever seen even in a dream before that time  They came in
two by two though matched in the most dissociable manner and mingled
together in a kind of dance  It would be tedious to describe their
habits and persons for which reason I shall only inform my reader that
the first couple were Tyranny and Anarchy the second were Bigotry and
Atheism the third the Genius of a commonwealth and a young man of about
twentytwo years of age whose name I could not learn  He had a sword in
his right hand which in the dance he often brandished at the Act of
Settlement and a citizen who stood by me whispered in my ear that he
saw a sponge in his left hand  The dance of so many jarring natures put
me in mind of the sun moon and earth in the Rehearsal that danced
together for no other end but to eclipse one another
The reader will easily suppose by what has been before said that the
lady on the throne would have been almost frighted to distraction had
she seen but any one of the spectres what then must have been her
condition when she saw them all in a body  She fainted and died away at
the sight
Et neque jam color est misto candore rubori
Nec vigor et vires et quae modo rise placebant
Nec corpus remanet
OVID Met iii 491
Her spirits faint
Her blooming cheeks assume a pallid teint
And scarce her form remains
There was as great a change in the hill of moneybags and the heaps of
money the former shrinking and falling into so many empty bags that I
now found not above a tenth part of them had been filled with money
The rest that took up the same space and made the same figure as the
bags that were really filled with money had been blown up with air and
called into my memory the bags full of wind which Homer tells us his
hero received as a present from AEolus  The great heaps of gold on
either side the throne now appeared to be only heaps of paper or little
piles of notched sticks bound up together in bundles like Bath faggots
Whilst I was lamenting this sudden desolation that had been made before
me the whole scene vanished  In the room of the frightful spectres
there now entered a second dance of apparitions very agreeably matched
together and made up of very amiable phantoms the first pair was
Liberty with Monarchy at her right hand the second was Moderation
leading in Religion and the third a person whom I had never seen with
the Genius of Great Britain  At the first entrance the lady revived
the bags swelled to their former bulk the piles of faggots and heaps of
paper changed into pyramids of guineas and for my own part I was so
transported with joy that I awaked though I must confess I would fain
have fallen asleep again to have closed my vision if I could have done
it
HOUSEHOLD SUPERSTITIONS
Somnia terrores magicos miracula sagas

HOR Ep ii 2 208
Visions and magic spells can you despise
And laugh at witches ghosts and prodigies
Going yesterday to dine with an old acquaintance I had the misfortune to
find his whole family very much dejected  Upon asking him the occasion
of it he told me that his wife had dreamt a very strange dream the night
before which they were afraid portended some misfortune to themselves or
to their children  At her coming into the room I observed a settled
melancholy in her countenance which I should have been troubled for had
I not heard from whence it proceeded  We were no sooner sat down but
after having looked upon me a little while My dear says she turning
to her husband you may now see the stranger that was in the candle last
night  Soon after this as they began to talk of family affairs a
little boy at the lower end of the table told her that he was to go into
joinhand on Thursday  Thursday says she  No child if it please
God you shall not begin upon Childermasday tell your writingmaster
that Friday will be soon enough  I was reflecting with myself on the
oddness of her fancy and wondering that anybody would establish it as a
rule to lose a day in every week  In the midst of these my musings she
desired me to reach her a little salt upon the point of my knife which I
did in such a trepidation and hurry of obedience that I let it drop by
the way at which she immediately startled and said it fell towards her
Upon this I looked very blank and observing the concern of the whole
table began to consider myself with some confusion as a person that
had brought a disaster upon the family  The lady however recovering
herself after a little space said to her husband with a sigh My dear
misfortunes never come single  My friend I found acted but an under
part at his table and being a man of more goodnature than
understanding thinks himself obliged to fall in with all the passions
and humours of his yokefellow  Do not you remember child says she
that the pigeonhouse fell the very afternoon that our careless wench
spilt the salt upon the tableYes says he my dear and the next
post brought us an account of the battle of Almanza  The reader may
guess at the figure I made after having done all this mischief  I
despatched my dinner as soon as I could with my usual taciturnity when
to my utter confusion the lady seeing me quitting my knife and fork and
laying them across one another upon my plate desired me that I would
humour her so far as to take them out of that figure and place them side
by side  What the absurdity was which I had committed I did not know
but I suppose there was some traditionary superstition in it and
therefore in obedience to the lady of the house I disposed of my knife
and fork in two parallel lines which is the figure I shall always lay
them in for the future though I do not know any reason for it
It is not difficult for a man to see that a person has conceived an
aversion to him  For my own part I quickly found by the ladys looks
that she regarded me as a very odd kind of fellow with an unfortunate
aspect for which reason I took my leave immediately after dinner and
withdrew to my own lodgings  Upon my return home I fell into a profound
contemplation on the evils that attend these superstitious follies of
mankind how they subject us to imaginary afflictions and additional
sorrows that do not properly come within our lot  As if the natural
calamities of life were not sufficient for it we turn the most
indifferent circumstances into misfortunes and suffer as much from
trifling accidents as from real evils  I have known the shooting of a
star spoil a nights rest and have seen a man in love grow pale and
lose his appetite upon the plucking of a merrythought  A screechowl
at midnight has alarmed a family more than a band of robbers nay the
voice of a cricket hath struck more terror than the roaring of a lion
There is nothing so inconsiderable which may not appear dreadful to an
imagination that is filled with omens and prognostics a rusty nail or a
crooked pin shoot up into prodigies
I remember I was once in a mixed assembly that was full of noise and
mirth when on a sudden an old woman unluckily observed there were
thirteen of us in company  This remark struck a panic terror into
several who were present insomuch that one or two of the ladies were
going to leave the room but a friend of mine taking notice that one of
our female companions was big with child affirmed there were fourteen in
the room and that instead of portending one of the company should die
it plainly foretold one of them should be born  Had not my friend found
this expedient to break the omen I question not but half the women in
the company would have fallen sick that very night
An old maid that is troubled with the vapours produces infinite
disturbances of this kind among her friends and neighbours  I know a
maiden aunt of a great family who is one of these antiquated Sibyls
that forebodes and prophesies from one end of the year to the other  She
is always seeing apparitions and hearing deathwatches and was the other
day almost frighted out of her wits by the great housedog that howled in
the stable at a time when she lay ill of the toothache  Such an
extravagant cast of mind engages multitudes of people not only in
impertinent terrors but in supernumerary duties of life and arises from
that fear and ignorance which are natural to the soul of man  The horror
with which we entertain the thoughts of death or indeed of any future
evil and the uncertainty of its approach fill a melancholy mind with
innumerable apprehensions and suspicions and consequently dispose it to
the observation of such groundless prodigies and predictions  For as it
is the chief concern of wise men to retrench the evils of life by the
reasonings of philosophy it is the employment of fools to multiply them
by the sentiments of superstition
For my own part I should be very much troubled were I endowed with this
divining quality though it should inform me truly of everything that can
befall me  I would not anticipate the relish of any happiness nor feel
the weight of any misery before it actually arrives
I know but one way of fortifying my soul against these gloomy presages
and terrors of mind and that is by securing to myself the friendship
and protection of that Being who disposes of events and governs futurity
He sees at one view the whole thread of my existence not only that
part of it which I have already passed through but that which runs
forward into all the depths of eternity  When I lay me down to sleep I
recommend myself to His care when I awake I give myself up to His
direction  Amidst all the evils that threaten me I will look up to Him
for help and question not but He will either avert them or turn them to
my advantage  Though I know neither the time nor the manner of the death
I am to die I am not at all solicitous about it because I am sure that
he knows them both and that He will not fail to comfort and support me
under them
OPERA LIONS
Dic mihi si fias tu leo qualis eris
MART xii 93
Were you a lion how would you behave
There is nothing that of late years has afforded matter of greater
amusement to the town than Signior Nicolinis combat with a lion in the
Haymarket which has been very often exhibited to the general
satisfaction of most of the nobility and gentry in the kingdom of Great
Britain  Upon the first rumour of this intended combat it was
confidently affirmed and is still believed by many in both galleries
that there would be a tame lion sent from the tower every opera night in
order to be killed by Hydaspes  This report though altogether
groundless so universally prevailed in the upper regions of the
playhouse that some of the most refined politicians in those parts of
the audience gave it out in whisper that the lion was a cousingerman of
the tiger who made his appearance in King Williams days and that the
stage would be supplied with lions at the public expense during the whole
session  Many likewise were the conjectures of the treatment which this
lion was to meet with from the hands of Signior Nicolini some supposed
that he was to subdue him in recitativo as Orpheus used to serve the
wild beasts in his time and afterwards to knock him on the head some
fancied that the lion would not pretend to lay his paws upon the hero by
reason of the received opinion that a lion will not hurt a virgin
several who pretended to have seen the opera in Italy had informed their
friends that the lion was to act a part in High Dutch and roar twice or
thrice to a thorough bass before he fell at the feet of Hydaspes  To
clear up a matter that was so variously reported I have made it my
business to examine whether this pretended lion is really the savage he
appears to be or only a counterfeit
But before I communicate my discoveries I must acquaint the reader that
upon my walking behind the scenes last winter as I was thinking on
something else I accidentally jostled against a monstrous animal that
extremely startled me and upon my nearer survey of it appeared to be a
lion rampant  The lion seeing me very much surprised told me in a
gentle voice that I might come by him if I pleased for says he I
do not intend to hurt anybody  I thanked him very kindly and passed by
him and in a little time after saw him leap upon the stage and act his
part with very great applause  It has been observed by several that the
lion has changed his manner of acting twice or thrice since his first
appearance which will not seem strange when I acquaint my reader that
the lion has been changed upon the audience three several times  The
first lion was a candlesnuffer who being a fellow of a testy choleric
temper overdid his part and would not suffer himself to be killed so
easily as he ought to have done besides it was observed of him that he
grew more surly every time he came out of the lion and having dropped
some words in ordinary conversation as if he had not fought his best
and that he suffered himself to be thrown upon his back in the scuffle
and that he would wrestle with Mr Nicolini for what he pleased out of
his lions skin it was thought proper to discard him and it is verily
believed to this day that had he been brought upon the stage another
time he would certainly have done mischief  Besides it was objected
against the first lion that he reared himself so high upon his hinder
paws and walked in so erect a posture that he looked more like an old
man than a lion
The second lion was a tailor by trade who belonged to the playhouse and
had the character of a mild and peaceable man in his profession  If the
former was too furious this was too sheepish for his part inasmuch
that after a short modest walk upon the stage he would fall at the
first touch of Hydaspes without grappling with him and giving him an
opportunity of showing his variety of Italian trips  It is said indeed
that he once gave him a rip in his fleshcolour doublet but this was
only to make work for himself in his private character of a tailor  I
must not omit that it was this second lion who treated me with so much
humanity behind the scenes
The acting lion at present is as I am informed a country gentleman who
does it for his diversion but desires his name may be concealed  He
says very handsomely in his own excuse that he does not act for gain
that he indulges an innocent pleasure in it and that it is better to
pass away an evening in this manner than in gaming and drinking but at
the same time says with a very agreeable raillery upon himself that if
his name should be known the illnatured world might call him the ass
in the lions skin  This gentlemans temper is made out of such a happy
mixture of the mild and the choleric that he outdoes both his
predecessors and has drawn together greater audiences than have been
known in the memory of man
I must not conclude my narrative without taking notice of a groundless
report that has been raised to a gentlemans disadvantage of whom I must
declare myself an admirer namely that Signior Nicolini and the lion
have been seen sitting peaceably by one another and smoking a pipe
together behind the scenes by which their common enemies would insinuate
that it is but a sham combat which they represent upon the stage but
upon inquiry I find that if any such correspondence has passed between
them it was not till the combat was over when the lion was to be looked
upon as dead according to the received rules of the drama  Besides this
is what is practised every day in Westminster Hall where nothing is more
usual than to see a couple of lawyers who have been tearing each other
to pieces in the court embracing one another as soon as they are out of
it
I would not be thought in any part of this relation to reflect upon
Signior Nicolini who in acting this part only complies with the
wretched taste of his audience he knows very well that the lion has many
more admirers than himself as they say of the famous equestrian statue
on the PontNeuf at Paris that more people go to see the horse than the
king who sits upon it  On the contrary it gives me a just indignation
to see a person whose action gives new majesty to kings resolution to
heroes and softness to lovers thus sinking from the greatness of his
behaviour and degraded into the character of the London Prentice  I
have often wished that our tragedians would copy after this great master
in action  Could they make the same use of their arms and legs and
inform their faces with as significant looks and passions how glorious
would an English tragedy appear with that action which is capable of
giving a dignity to the forced thoughts cold conceits and unnatural
expressions of an Italian opera  In the meantime I have related this
combat of the lion to show what are at present the reigning
entertainments of the politer part of Great Britain
Audiences have often been reproached by writers for the coarseness of
their taste but our present grievance does not seem to be the want of a
good taste but of common sense
WOMEN AND WIVES
Parva leves capiunt animos
OVID Ars Am i 159
Light minds are pleased with trifles
When I was in France I used to gaze with great astonishment at the
splendid equipages and partycoloured habits of that fantastic nation  I
was one day in particular contemplating a lady that sat in a coach
adorned with gilded Cupids and finely painted with the Loves of Venus
and Adonis  The coach was drawn by six milkwhite horses and loaden
behind with the same number of powdered footmen  Just before the lady
were a couple of beautiful pages that were stuck among the harness and
by their gay dresses and smiling features looked like the elder brothers
of the little boys that were carved and painted in every corner of the
coach
The lady was the unfortunate Cleanthe who afterwards gave an occasion to
a pretty melancholy novel  She had for several years received the
addresses of a gentleman whom after a long and intimate acquaintance
she forsook upon the account of this shining equipage which had been
offered to her by one of great riches but a crazy constitution  The
circumstances in which I saw her were it seems the disguises only of a
broken heart and a kind of pageantry to cover distress for in two
months after she was carried to her grave with the same pomp and
magnificence being sent thither partly by the loss of one lover and
partly by the possession of another
I have often reflected with myself on this unaccountable humour in
womankind of being smitten with everything that is showy and
superficial and on the numberless evils that befall the sex from this
light fantastical disposition  I myself remember a young lady that was
very warmly solicited by a couple of importunate rivals who for several
months together did all they could to recommend themselves by
complacency of behaviour and agreeableness of conversation  At length
when the competition was doubtful and the lady undetermined in her
choice one of the young lovers very luckily bethought himself of adding
a supernumerary lace to his liveries which had so good an effect that he
married her the very week after
The usual conversation of ordinary women very much cherishes this natural
weakness of being taken with outside and appearance  Talk of a
newmarried couple and you immediately hear whether they keep their
coach and six or eat in plate  Mention the name of an absent lady and
it is ten to one but you learn something of her gown and petticoat  A
ball is a great help to discourse and a birthday furnishes conversation
for a twelvemonth after  A furbelow of precious stones a hat buttoned
with a diamond a brocade waistcoat or petticoat are standing topics  In
short they consider only the drapery of the species and never cast away
a thought on those ornaments of the mind that make persons illustrious in
themselves and useful to others  When women are thus perpetually
dazzling one anothers imaginations and filling their heads with nothing
but colours it is no wonder that they are more attentive to the
superficial parts of life than the solid and substantial blessings of it
A girl who has been trained up in this kind of conversation is in danger
of every embroidered coat that comes in her way  A pair of fringed
gloves may be her ruin  In a word lace and ribands silver and gold
galloons with the like glittering gewgaws are so many lures to women of
weak minds or low educations and when artificially displayed are able
to fetch down the most airy coquette from the wildest of her flights and
rambles
True happiness is of a retired nature and an enemy to pomp and noise it
arises in the first place from the enjoyment of ones self and in the
next from the friendship and conversation of a few select companions it
loves shade and solitude and naturally haunts groves and fountains
fields and meadows in short it feels everything it wants within itself
and receives no addition from multitudes of witnesses and spectators  On
the contrary false happiness loves to be in a crowd and to draw the
eyes of the world upon her  She does not receive any satisfaction from
the applauses which she gives herself but from the admiration she raises
in others  She flourishes in courts and palaces theatres and
assemblies and has no existence but when she is looked upon
Aurelia though a woman of great quality delights in the privacy of a
country life and passes away a great part of her time in her own walks
and gardens  Her husband who is her bosom friend and companion in her
solitudes has been in love with her ever since he knew her  They both
abound with good sense consummate virtue and a mutual esteem and are a
perpetual entertainment to one another  Their family is under so regular
an economy in its hours of devotion and repast employment and
diversion that it looks like a little commonwealth within itself  They
often go into company that they may return with the greater delight to
one another and sometimes live in town not to enjoy it so properly as
to grow weary of it that they may renew in themselves the relish of a
country life  By this means they are happy in each other beloved by
their children adored by their servants and are become the envy or
rather the delight of all that know them
How different to this is the life of Fulvia  She considers her husband
as her steward and looks upon discretion and good housewifery as little
domestic virtues unbecoming a woman of quality  She thinks life lost in
her own family and fancies herself out of the world when she is not in
the ring the playhouse or the drawingroom  She lives in a perpetual
motion of body and restlessness of thought and is never easy in any one
place when she thinks there is more company in another  The missing of
an opera the first night would be more afflicting to her than the death
of a child  She pities all the valuable part of her own sex and calls
every woman of a prudent modest retired life a poorspirited
unpolished creature  What a mortification would it be to Fulvia if she
knew that her setting herself to view is but exposing herself and that
she grows contemptible by being conspicuous
I cannot conclude my paper without observing that Virgil has very finely
touched upon this female passion for dress and show in the character of
Camilla who though she seems to have shaken off all the other
weaknesses of her sex is still described as a woman in this particular
The poet tells us that after having made a great slaughter of the enemy
she unfortunately cast her eye on a Trojan who wore an embroidered
tunic a beautiful coat of mail with a mantle of the finest purple  A
golden bow says he hung upon his shoulder his garment was buckled
with a golden clasp and his head covered with a helmet of the same
shining metal  The Amazon immediately singled out this welldressed
warrior being seized with a womans longing for the pretty trappings
that he was adorned with
Totumque incauta per agmen
Faemineo praedae et spoliorum ardebat amore
AEn xi 781
So greedy was she bent
On golden spoils and on her prey intent
DRYDEN
This heedless pursuit after these glittering trifles the poet by a nice
concealed moral represents to have been the destruction of his female
hero

CREECH
It is my design in this paper to deliver down to posterity a faithful
account of the Italian opera and of the gradual progress which it has
made upon the English stage for there is no question but our
greatgrandchildren will be very curious to know the reason why their
forefathers used to sit together like an audience of foreigners in their
