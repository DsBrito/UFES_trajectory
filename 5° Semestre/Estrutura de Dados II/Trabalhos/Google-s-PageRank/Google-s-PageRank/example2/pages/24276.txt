Month year century Look at them Six hundred of the worlds most
luxuriant colds and now not even a sniffle The chubby doctor sank
down behind the desk his ruddy face beaming Come now gentlemen be
reasonable Think positively Theres work to be done a great deal of
work Theyll be wanting me in Washington I imagine Press conference
in twenty minutes Drug houses to consult with How dare we stand in the
path of Progress Weve won the greatest medical triumph of all
timesthe conquering of the Common Cold Well go down in history
And he was perfectly right on one point at least
They did go down in history
The public response to the vaccine was little less than monumental Of
all the ailments that have tormented mankind through history none was
ever more universal more tenacious more uniformly miserable than the
common cold It was a respecter of no barriers boundaries or classes
ambassadors and chambermaids snuffled and sneezed in drippynosed
unanimity The powers in the Kremlin sniffed and blew and wept genuine
tears on drafty days while senatorial debates on earthshaking issues
paused reverently upon the unplugging of a nose the clearing of a
rhinorrheic throat Other illnesses brought disability even death in
their wake the common cold merely brought torment to the millions as it
implacably resisted the most superhuman of efforts to curb it
Until that chill rainy November day when the tidings broke to the world
in fourinch banner heads
COFFIN NAILS LID ON COMMON COLD
No More Coughin States CoFinder of Cure
SNIFFLES SNIPED SINGLE SHOT TO SAVE SNEEZERS
In medical circles it was called the Coffin Multicentric Upper
Respiratory VirusInhibiting Vaccine but the papers could never stand
for such highsounding names and called it simply The Coffin Cure
Below the banner heads worldrenowned feature writers expounded in
reverent terms the story of the leviathan struggle of Dr Chauncey
Patrick Coffin et al in solving this riddle of the ages how after
years of failure they ultimately succeeded in culturing the causative
agent of the common cold identifying it not as a single virus or group
of viruses but as a multicentric virus complex invading the soft mucous
linings of the nose throat and eyes capable of altering its basic
molecular structure at any time to resist efforts of the body from
within or the physician from without to attack and dispel it how the
hypothesis was set forth by Dr Phillip Dawson that the virus could be
destroyed only by an antibody which could freeze the viruscomplex in
one form long enough for normal body defenses to dispose of the
offending invader the exhausting search for such a crippling agent
and the final crowning success after injecting untold gallons of
coldvirus material into the hides of a group of cooperative and
forbearing dogs a species which never suffered from colds and hence
endured the whole business with an air of affectionate boredom
And finally the testing First Coffin himself who was suffering a
particularly horrendous case of the affliction he sought to cure then
his assistants Phillip Dawson and Jacob Miles then a multitude of
students from the Universitycarefully chosen for the severity of their
symptoms the longevity of their colds their tendency to acquire them
on little or no provocation and their utter inability to get rid of
them with any known medical program
They were a sorry spectacle those students filing through the Coffin
laboratory for three days in October wheezing like steam shovels
snorting and sneezing and sniffling and blowing coughing and squeaking
mute appeals glowing in their bloodshot eyes The researchers dispensed
the materialsa single shot in the right arm a sensitivity control in
the left
With growing delight they then watched as the results came in The
sneezing stopped the sniffling ceased A great silence settled over the
campus in the classrooms in the library in classic halls Dr
Coffins voice returned rather to the regret of his fellow workers and
he began bouncing about the laboratory like a small boy at a fair
Students by the dozen trooped in for checkups with noses dry and eyes
bright
In a matter of days there was no doubt left that the goal had been
reached
But we have to be sure Phillip Dawson had cried cautiously This
was only a pilot test We need mass testing now on an entire community
We should go to the West Coast and run studies therethey have a
different breed of cold out there I hear Well have to see how long
the immunity lasts make sure there are no unexpected side effects
And muttering to himself he fell to work with pad and pencil
calculating the program to be undertaken before publication
But there were rumors Underwood at Stanford they said had already
completed his tests and was preparing a paper for publication in a
matter of months Surely with such dramatic results on the pilot tests
something could be put into print It would be tragic to lose the race
for the sake of a little unnecessary caution
Peter Dawson was adamant but he was a voice crying in the wilderness
Chauncey Patrick Coffin was boss
Within a week even Coffin was wondering if he had bitten off just a
trifle too much They had expected that demand for the vaccine would be
greatbut even the grisly memory of the early days of the Salk vaccine
had not prepared them for the mobs of sneezing wheezing redeyed people
bombarding them for the first fruits
Cleareyed young men from the Government Bureau pushed through crowds of
local townspeople lining the streets outside the Coffin laboratory
standing in pouring rain to raise insistent placards
Seventeen pharmaceutical houses descended like vultures with production
plans costestimates colorful graphs demonstrating proposed yield and
distribution programs Coffin was flown to Washington where conferences
labored far into the night as demands pounded their doors like a tidal
wave
One laboratory promised the vaccine in ten days another said a week
The first actually appeared in three weeks and two days to be soaked up
in the space of three hours by the thirsty sponge of coldweary
humanity Express planes were dispatched to Europe to Asia to Africa
with the precious cargo a million needles pierced a million hides and
with a huge convulsive sneeze mankind stepped forth into a new era
There were abstainers of course There always are
It doesnt bake eddy differets how much you talk Ellie Dawson cried
hoarsely shaking her blonde curls I dodt wadt eddy cold shots
Youre being totally unreasonable Phillip said glowering at his wife
in annoyance She wasnt the sweet young thing he had married not this
evening Her eyes were puffy her nose red and dripping Youve had
this cold for two solid months now and there just isnt any sense to
it Its making you miserable You cant eat you cant breathe you
cant sleep
I dodt wadt eddy cold shots she repeated stubbornly
But why not Just one little needle youd hardly feel it
But I dodt like deedles she cried bursting into tears Why dodt
you leave be alode Go take your dasty old deedles ad stick theb id
people that wadt theb
Aw Ellie
I dodt care I dodt like deedles she wailed burying her face in
his shirt
He held her close making comforting little noises It was no use he
reflected sadly Science just wasnt Ellies long suit she didnt know
a cold vaccine from a case of smallpox and no appeal to logic or common
sense could surmount her irrational fear of hypodermics All right
nobodys going to make you do anything you dont want to he said
Ad eddyway thik of the poor tissue badufacturers she sniffled
wiping her nose with a pink facial tissue All their little childred
starvig to death
Say you have got a cold said Phillip sniffing Youve got on
enough perfume to fell an ox He wiped away tears and grinned at her
Come on now fix your face Dinner at the Driftwood I hear they have
marvelous lamb chops
It was a mellow evening The lamb chops were delectablethe tastiest
lamb chops he had ever eaten he thought even being blessed with as
good a cook as Ellie for a spouse Ellie dripped and blew continuously
but refused to go home until they had taken in a movie and stopped by
to dance a while I hardly ever gedt to see you eddy bore she said
All because of that dasty bedicide youre givig people
It was true of course The work at the lab was endless They danced
but came home early nevertheless Phillip needed all the sleep he could
get
He awoke once during the night to a parade of sneezes from his wife and
rolled over frowning sleepily to himself It was ignominious in a
wayhis own wife refusing the fruit of all those months of work
And cold or no cold she surely was using a whale of a lot of perfume
He awoke suddenly began to stretch and sat bolt upright in bed
staring wildly about the room Pale morning sunlight drifted in the
window Downstairs he heard Ellie stirring in the kitchen
For a moment he thought he was suffocating He leaped out of bed stared
at the vanity table across the room Somebodys spilled the whole
damned bottle
The heavy sicksweet miasma hung like a cloud around him drenching the
room With every breath it grew thicker He searched the table top
frantically but there were no empty bottles His head began to spin
from the sickening effluvium
He blinked in confusion his hand trembling as he lit a cigarette No
need to panic he thought She probably knocked a bottle over when she
was dressing He took a deep puff and burst into a paroxysm of coughing
as acrid fumes burned down his throat to his lungs
Ellie He rushed into the hall still coughing The match smell had
given way to the harsh caustic stench of burning weeds He stared at
his cigarette in horror and threw it into the sink The smell grew
worse He threw open the hall closet expecting smoke to come billowing
out Ellie Somebodys burning down the house
Whadtever are you talking about Ellies voice came from the stair
well Its just the toast I burned silly
He rushed down the stairs two at a timeand nearly gagged as he reached
the bottom The smell of hot rancid grease struck him like a solid
wall It was intermingled with an oily smell of boiled and parboiled
coffee overpowering in its intensity By the time he reached the
kitchen he was holding his nose tears pouring from his eyes Ellie
what are you doing in here
She stared at him Ib baking breakfast
But dont you smell it
Sbell whadt said Ellie
On the stove the automatic percolator was making small promising
noises In the frying pan four sunnyside eggs were sizzling half a
dozen strips of bacon drained on a paper towel on the sideboard It
couldnt have looked more innocent
Cautiously Phillip released his nose sniffed The stench nearly choked
him You mean you dont smell anything strange
I didt sbell eddythig period said Ellie defensively
The coffee the baconcome here a minute
She reekedof bacon of coffee of burned toast but mostly of perfume
Did you put on any fresh perfume this morning
Before breakfast Dodt be ridiculous
Not even a drop Phillip was turning very white
Dot a drop
He shook his head Now wait a minute This must be all in my mind
Imjust imagining things thats all Working too hard hysterical
reaction In a minute itll all go away He poured a cup of coffee
added cream and sugar
But he couldnt get it close enough to taste it It smelled as if it had
been boiling three weeks in a rancid pot It was the smell of coffee
all right but a smell that was fiendishly distorted overpoweringly
nauseatingly magnified It pervaded the room and burned his throat and
brought tears gushing to his eyes
Slowly realization began to dawn He spilled the coffee as he set the
cup down The perfume The coffee The cigarette
My hat he choked Get me my hat Ive got to get to the laboratory
It got worse all the way downtown He fought down waves of nausea as the
smell of damp rotting earth rose from his front yard in a gray cloud
The neighbors dog dashed out to greet him exuding the
greatgrandfather of all doggy odors As Phillip waited for the bus
every passing car fouled the air with noxious fumes gagging him
doubling him up with coughing as he dabbed at his streaming eyes
Nobody else seemed to notice anything wrong at all
The bus ride was a nightmare It was a damp rainy day the inside of
the bus smelled like the mens locker room after a big game A
blearyeyed man with threedays stubble on his chin flopped down in the
seat next to him and Phillip reeled back with a jolt to the job he had
held in his student days cleaning vats in the brewery
Itsh a great morning Blearyeyes breathed at him huh Doc
Phillip blanched To top it the man had had a breakfast of salami In
the seat ahead a fat man held a dead cigar clamped in his mouth like a
rank growth Phillips stomach began rolling he sank his face into his
hand trying unobtrusively to clamp his nostrils With a groan of
deliverance he lurched off the bus at the laboratory gate
He met Jake Miles coming up the steps Jake looked pale too pale
Morning Phillip said weakly Nice day Looks like the sun might come
through
Yeah said Jake Nice day Youuhfeel all right this morning
Fine fine Phillip tossed his hat in the closet opened the incubator
on his culture tubes trying to look busy He slammed the door after one
whiff and gripped the edge of the work table with whitening knuckles
Why
Oh nothing Thought you looked a little peaked was all
They stared at each other in silence Then as though by signal their
eyes turned to the office at the end of the lab
Coffin come in yet
Jake nodded Hes in there Hes got the door locked
I think hes going to have to open it said Phillip
A grayfaced Dr Coffin unlocked the door backed quickly toward the
wall The room reeked of kitchen deodorant Stay right where you are
Coffin squeaked Dont come a step closer I cant see you now
ImIm busy Ive got work that has to be done
Youre telling me growled Phillip He motioned Jake into the office
and locked the door carefully Then he turned to Coffin When did it
start for you
Coffin was trembling Right after supper last night I thought I was
going to suffocate Got up and walked the streets all night My God
what a stench
Jake
Dr Miles shook his head Sometime this morning I dont know when I
woke up with it
Thats when it hit me said Phillip
But I dont understand Coffin howled Nobody else seems to notice
anything
Yet said Phillip we were the first three to take the Coffin Cure
remember You and me and Jake Two months ago
Coffins forehead was beaded with sweat He stared at the two men in
growing horror But what about the others he whispered
I think said Phillip that wed better find something spectacular to
do in a mighty big hurry Thats what I think
Jake Miles said The most important thing right now is secrecy We
mustnt let a word get out not until were absolutely certain
But whats happened Coffin cried These foul smells everywhere
You Phillip you had a cigarette this morning I can smell it clear
over here and its bringing tears to my eyes And if I didnt know
better Id swear neither of you had had a bath in a week Every odor in
town has suddenly turned foul
Magnified you mean said Jake Perfume still smells sweettheres
just too much of it The same with cinnamon I tried it Cried for half
an hour but it still smelled like cinnamon No I dont think the
smells have changed any
But what then
Our noses have changed obviously Jake paced the floor in excitement
Look at our dogs Theyve never had coldsand they practically live by
their noses Other animalsall dependent on their senses of smell for
survivaland none of them ever have anything even vaguely reminiscent
of a common cold The multicentric virus hits primates onlyand it
reaches its fullest parasitic powers in man alone
Coffin shook his head miserably But why this horrible stench all of a
sudden I havent had a cold in weeks
Of course not Thats just what Im trying to say Jake cried Look
why do we have any sense of smell at all Because we have tiny olfactory
nerve endings buried in the mucous membrane of our noses and throats
But we have always had the virus living there too colds or no colds
throughout our entire lifetime Its always been there anchored in
the same cells parasitizing the same sensitive tissues that carry our
olfactory nerve endings numbing them and crippling them making them
practically useless as sensory organs No wonder we never smelled
anything before Those poor little nerve endings never had a chance
Until we came along in our shining armor and destroyed the virus said
Phillip
Oh we didnt destroy it We merely stripped it of a very slippery
protective mechanism against normal body defences Jake perched on the
edge of the desk his dark face intense These two months since we had
our shots have witnessed a battle to the death between our bodies and
the virus With the help of the vaccine our bodies have won thats
allstripped away the last vestiges of an invader that has been almost
a part of our normal physiology since the beginning of time And now for
the first time those crippled little nerve endings are just beginning to
function
God help us Coffin groaned You think itll get worse
And worse And still worse said Jake
I wonder said Phillip slowly what the anthropologists will say
What do you mean
Maybe it was just a single mutation somewhere back there Just a tiny
change of cell structure or metabolism that left one line of primates
vulnerable to an invader no other would harbor Why else should man have
begun to flower and blossom intellectuallygrow to depend so much on
his brains instead of his brawn that he could rise above all others
What better reason than because somewhere along the line in the world of
fang and claw he suddenly lost his sense of smell
They stared at each other Well hes got it back again now Coffin
wailed and hes not going to like it a bit
No he surely isnt Jake agreed Hes going to start looking very
quickly for someone to blame I think
They both looked at Coffin
Now dont be ridiculous boys said Coffin turning white Were in
this together Phillip it was your idea in the first placeyou said so
yourself You cant leave me now
The telephone jangled They heard the frightened voice of the secretary
clear across the room Dr Coffin There was a student on the line just
a moment ago Hehe said he was coming up to see you Now he said not
later
Im busy Coffin sputtered I cant see anyone And I cant take any
calls
But hes already on his way up the girl burst out He was saying
something about tearing you apart with his bare hands
Coffin slammed down the receiver His face was the color of lead
Theyll crucify me he sobbed JakePhillipyouve got to help me
Phillip sighed and unlocked the door Send a girl down to the freezer
and have her bring up all the live cold virus she can find Get us some
inoculated monkeys and a few dozen dogs He turned to Coffin And
stop sniveling Youre the big publicity man around here youre going
to handle the screaming masses whether you like it or not
But what are you going to do
I havent the faintest idea said Phillip but whatever I do is going
to cost you your shirt Were going to find out how to catch cold again
if we have to die
It was an admirable struggle and a futile one They sprayed their noses
and throats with enough pure culture of virulent live virus to have
condemned an ordinary man to a lifetime of sneezing wateryeyed misery
They didnt develop a sniffle among them They mixed six different
strains of virus and gargled the extract spraying themselves and every
inoculated monkey they could get their hands on with the vilesmelling
stuff Not a sneeze They injected it hypodermically intradermally
subcutaneously intramuscularly and intravenously They drank it They
bathed in the stuff
But they didnt catch a cold
Maybe its the wrong approach Jake said one morning Our body
defenses are keyed up to top performance right now Maybe if we break
them down we can get somewhere
They plunged down that alley with grim abandon They starved themselves
They forced themselves to stay awake for days on end until exhaustion
forced their eyes closed in spite of all they could do They carefully
devised vitaminfree proteinfree mineralfree diets that tasted like
library paste and smelled worse They wore wet clothes and sopping shoes
to work turned off the heat and threw windows open to the raw winter
air Then they resprayed themselves with the live cold virus and waited
reverently for the sneezing to begin
It didnt They stared at each other in gathering gloom Theyd never
felt better in their lives
Except for the smells of course Theyd hoped that they might
presently get used to them They didnt Every day it grew a little
worse They began smelling smells they never dreamed existednoxious
smells cloying smells smells that drove them gagging to the sinks
Their noseplugs were rapidly losing their effectiveness Mealtimes were
nightmarish ordeals they lost weight with alarming speed
But they didnt catch cold
I think you should all be locked up Ellie Dawson said severely as
she dragged her husband bluefaced and shivering out of an icy shower
one bitter morning Youve lost your wits You need to be protected
against yourselves thats what you need
You dont understand Phillip moaned Weve got to catch cold
Why Ellie snapped angrily Suppose you dontwhats going to
happen
We had three hundred students march on the laboratory today Phillip
said patiently The smells were driving them crazy they said They
couldnt even bear to be close to their best friends They wanted
something done about it or else they wanted blood Tomorrow well have
them back and three hundred more And they were just the pilot study
Whats going to happen when fifteen million people find their noses
going bad on them He shuddered Have you seen the papers People are
already going around sniffing like bloodhounds And now were finding
out what a thorough job we did We cant crack it Ellie We cant even
get a toe hold Those antibodies are just doing too good a job
Well maybe you can find some unclebodies to take care of them Ellie
offered vaguely
Look dont make bad jokes
Im not making jokes All I want is a husband back who doesnt complain
about how everything smells and eats the dinners I cook and doesnt
stand around in cold showers at six in the morning
I know its miserable he said helplessly But I dont know how to
stop it
He found Jake and Coffin in tightlipped conference when he reached the
lab I cant do it any more Coffin was saying Ive begged them for
time Ive threatened them Ive promised them everything but my upper
plate I cant face them again I just cant
We only have a few days left Jake said grimly If we dont come up
with something were goners
Phillips jaw suddenly sagged as he stared at them You know what I
think he said suddenly I think weve been prize idiots Weve gotten
so rattled we havent used our heads And all the time its been sitting
there blinking at us
What are you talking about snapped Jake
Unclebodies said Phillip
Oh great God
No Im serious Phillips eyes were very bright How many of those
students do you think you can corral to help us
Coffin gulped Six hundred Theyre out there in the street right now
howling for a lynching
All right I want them in here And I want some monkeys Monkeys with
colds the worse colds the better
Do you have any idea what youre doing asked Jake
None in the least said Phillip happily except that its never been
done before But maybe its time we tried following our noses for a
while
The tidal wave began to break two days later  only a few people here
a dozen there but enough to confirm the direst newspaper predictions
The boomerang was completing its circle
At the laboratory the doors were kept barred the telephones
disconnected Within there was a bustle of feverishif
odorousactivity For the three researchers the olfactory acuity had
reached agonizing proportions Even the small gas masks Phillip had
devised could no longer shield them from the constant barrage of violent
odors
But the work went on in spite of the smell Truckloads of monkeys
arrived at the labcoldridden monkeys sneezing coughing weeping
wheezing monkeys by the dozen Culture trays bulged with tubes
overflowed the incubators and work tables Each day six hundred angry
students paraded through the lab arms exposed mouths open grumbling
but cooperating
At the end of the first week half the monkeys were cured of their colds
and were quite unable to catch them back the other half had new colds
and couldnt get rid of them Phillip observed this fact with grim
satisfaction and went about the laboratory mumbling to himself
Two days later he burst forth jubilantly lugging a sadlooking puppy
under his arm It was like no other puppy in the world This puppy was
sneezing and snuffling with a perfect howler of a cold
The day came when they injected a tiny droplet of milky fluid beneath
the skin of Phillips arm and then got the virus spray and gave his
nose and throat a liberal application Then they sat back and waited
They were still waiting three days later
It was a great idea Jake said gloomily flipping a bulging notebook
closed with finality It just didnt work was all
Phillip nodded Both men had grown thin with pouches under their eyes
Jakes right eye had begun to twitch uncontrollably whenever anyone came
within three yards of him We cant go on like this you know The
people are going wild
Wheres Coffin
He collapsed three days ago Nervous prostration He kept having dreams
about hangings
Phillip sighed Well I suppose wed better just face it Nice knowing
you Jake Pity it had to be this way
It was a great try old man A great try
Ah yes Nothing like going down in a blaze of
Phillip stopped dead his eyes widening His nose began to twitch He
took a gasp a larger gasp as a longdead reflex came sleepily to life
shook its head reared back
Phillip sneezed
He sneezed for ten minutes without a pause until he lay on the floor
bluefaced and gasping for air He caught hold of Jake wringing his
hand as tears gushed from his eyes He gave his nose an enormous blow
and headed shakily for the telephone
It was a sipple edough pridciple he said later to Ellie as she spread
mustard on his chest and poured more warm water into his foot bath The
Cure itself depedded upod itthe adtigedadtibody reactiod We had the
adtibody agaidst the virus all ridght what we had to find was sobe
kide of adtibody agaidst the adtibody He sneezed violently and
poured in nose drops with a happy grin
Will they be able to make it fast enough
Just aboudt fast edough for people to get good ad eager to catch cold
agaid said Phillip Theres odly wud little hitch
Ellie Dawson took the steaks from the grill and set them still
sizzling on the dinner table Hitch
Phillip nodded as he chewed the steak with a pretence of enthusiasm It
tasted like slightly damp Kration
This stuff weve bade does a real good job Just a little too good He
wiped his nose and reached for a fresh tissue
I bay be wrog but I thik Ive got this cold for keeps he said sadly
Udless I cad fide ad adtibody agaidst the adtibody agaidst the
