that she one of these days will dedicate a book

eight dreadful dragons

The Book of DRAGONS
Illustration THE BOOK OF BEASTS
I The Book of Beasts
He happened to be building a Palace when the news came and he left all
the bricks kicking about the floor for Nurse to clear upbut then the
news was rather remarkable news You see there was a knock at the front
door and voices talking downstairs and Lionel thought it was the man
come to see about the gas which had not been allowed to be lighted
since the day when Lionel made a swing by tying his skipping rope to the
gas bracket
And then quite suddenly Nurse came in and said Master Lionel dear
theyve come to fetch you to go and be King
Then she made haste to change his smock and to wash his face and hands
and brush his hair and all the time she was doing it Lionel kept
wriggling and fidgeting and saying Oh dont Nurse and Im sure
my ears are quite clean or Never mind my hair its all right and
Thatll do
Youre going on as if you was going to be an eel instead of a King
said Nurse
The minute Nurse let go for a moment Lionel bolted off without waiting
for his clean handkerchief and in the drawing room there were two very
gravelooking gentlemen in red robes with fur and gold coronets with
velvet sticking up out of the middle like the cream in the very
expensive jam tarts
They bowed low to Lionel and the gravest one said Sire your
greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandfather the King of this country is
dead and now you have got to come and be King
Yes please sir said Lionel when does it begin
You will be crowned this afternoon said the grave gentleman who was
not quite so gravelooking as the other
Would you like me to bring Nurse or what time would you like me to be
fetched and hadnt I better put on my velvet suit with the lace
collar said Lionel who had often been out to tea
Your Nurse will be removed to the Palace later No never mind about
changing your suit the Royal robes will cover all that up
The grave gentlemen led the way to a coach with eight white horses
which was drawn up in front of the house where Lionel lived It was No
7 on the lefthand side of the street as you go up
Lionel ran upstairs at the last minute and he kissed Nurse and said
Thank you for washing me I wish Id let you do the other ear
Notheres no time now Give me the hanky Goodbye Nurse
Goodbye ducky said Nurse Be a good little King now and say
please and thank you and remember to pass the cake to the little
girls and dont have more than two helps of anything
So off went Lionel to be made a King He had never expected to be a King
any more than you have so it was all quite new to himso new that he
had never even thought of it And as the coach went through the town he
had to bite his tongue to be quite sure it was real because if his
tongue was real it showed he wasnt dreaming Half an hour before he had
been building with bricks in the nursery and nowthe streets were all
fluttering with flags every window was crowded with people waving
handkerchiefs and scattering flowers there were scarlet soldiers
everywhere along the pavements and all the bells of all the churches
were ringing like mad and like a great song to the music of their
ringing he heard thousands of people shouting Long live Lionel Long
live our little King
He was a little sorry at first that he had not put on his best clothes
but he soon forgot to think about that If he had been a girl he would
very likely have bothered about it the whole time
As they went along the grave gentlemen who were the Chancellor and the
Prime Minister explained the things which Lionel did not understand
I thought we were a Republic said Lionel Im sure there hasnt been
a King for some time
Sire your greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgrandfathers death happened
when my grandfather was a little boy said the Prime Minister and
since then your loyal people have been saving up to buy you a crownso
much a week you know according to peoples meanssixpence a week from
those who have firstrate pocket money down to a halfpenny a week from
those who havent so much You know its the rule that the crown must be
paid for by the people
But hadnt my greatgreathowevermuchitisgrandfather a crown
Yes but he sent it to be tinned over for fear of vanity and he had
had all the jewels taken out and sold them to buy books He was a
strange man a very good King he was but he had his faultshe was fond
of books Almost with his last breath he sent the crown to be
tinnedand he never lived to pay the tinsmiths bill
Here the Prime Minister wiped away a tear and just then the carriage
stopped and Lionel was taken out of the carriage to be crowned Being
crowned is much more tiring work than you would suppose and by the time
it was over and Lionel had worn the Royal robes for an hour or two and
had had his hand kissed by everybody whose business it was to do it he
was quite worn out and was very glad to get into the Palace nursery
Nurse was there and tea was ready seedy cake and plummy cake and jam
and hot buttered toast and the prettiest china with red and gold and
blue flowers on it and real tea and as many cups of it as you liked
After tea Lionel said I think I should like a book Will you get me
one Nurse
Bless the child said Nurse You dont suppose youve lost the use of
your legs with just being a King Run along do and get your books
yourself
So Lionel went down into the library The Prime Minister and the
Chancellor were there and when Lionel came in they bowed very low and
were beginning to ask Lionel most politely what on earth he was coming
bothering for nowwhen Lionel cried out Oh what a worldful of books
Are they yours
They are yours Your Majesty answered the Chancellor They were the
property of the late King your greatgreat
Yes I know Lionel interrupted Well I shall read them all I love
to read I am so glad I learned to read
If I might venture to advise Your Majesty said the Prime Minister I
should not read these books Your great
Yes said Lionel quickly
He was a very good Kingoh yes really a very superior King in his
way but he was a littlewell strange
Mad asked Lionel cheerfully
No noboth the gentlemen were sincerely shocked Not mad but if I
may express it so he wasertoo clever by half And I should not like
a little King of mine to have anything to do with his books
Lionel looked puzzled
The fact is the Chancellor went on twisting his red beard in an
agitated way your great
Go on said Lionel
was called a wizard
But he wasnt
Of course nota most worthy King was your great
I see
But I wouldnt touch his books
Just this one cried Lionel laying his hands on the cover of a great
brown book that lay on the study table It had gold patterns on the
brown leather and gold clasps with turquoises and rubies in the twists
of them and gold corners so that the leather should not wear out too
quickly
I must look at this one Lionel said for on the back in big letters
he read The Book of Beasts
The Chancellor said Dont be a silly little King
But Lionel had got the gold clasps undone and he opened the first page
and there was a beautiful Butterfly all red and brown and yellow and
blue so beautifully painted that it looked as if it were alive
There said Lionel Isnt that lovely Why
But as he spoke the beautiful Butterfly fluttered its manycolored wings
on the yellow old page of the book and flew up and out of the window
Well said the Prime Minister as soon as he could speak for the lump
of wonder that had got into his throat and tried to choke him thats
magic that is
But before he had spoken the King had turned the next page and there
was a shining bird complete and beautiful in every blue feather of him
Under him was written Blue Bird of Paradise and while the King gazed
enchanted at the charming picture the Blue Bird fluttered his wings on
the yellow page and spread them and flew out of the book
Then the Prime Minister snatched the book away from the King and shut it
up on the blank page where the bird had been and put it on a very high
shelf And the Chancellor gave the King a good shaking and said
Youre a naughty disobedient little King and was very angry indeed
I dont see that Ive done any harm said Lionel He hated being
shaken as all boys do he would much rather have been slapped
No harm said the Chancellor Ahbut what do you know about it
Thats the question How do you know what might have been on the next
pagea snake or a worm or a centipede or a revolutionist or
something like that
Well Im sorry if Ive vexed you said Lionel Come lets kiss and
be friends So he kissed the Prime Minister and they settled down for
a nice quiet game of noughts and crosses while the Chancellor went to
add up his accounts
But when Lionel was in bed he could not sleep for thinking of the book
and when the full moon was shining with all her might and light he got
up and crept down to the library and climbed up and got The Book of
Beasts
He took it outside to the terrace where the moonlight was as bright as
day and he opened the book and saw the empty pages with Butterfly
and Blue Bird of Paradise underneath and then he turned the next
page There was some sort of red thing sitting under a palm tree and
under it was written Dragon The Dragon did not move and the King
shut up the book rather quickly and went back to bed
But the next day he wanted another look so he took the book out into
the garden and when he undid the clasps with the rubies and turquoises
the book opened all by itself at the picture with Dragon underneath
and the sun shone full on the page And then quite suddenly a great
Red Dragon came out of the book and spread vast scarlet wings and flew
away across the garden to the far hills and Lionel was left with the
empty page before him for the page was quite empty except for the green
palm tree and the yellow desert and the little streaks of red where the
paintbrush had gone outside the pencil outline of the Red Dragon
And then Lionel felt that he had indeed done it He had not been King
twentyfour hours and already he had let loose a Red Dragon to worry
his faithful subjects lives out And they had been saving up so long to
buy him a crown and everything
Lionel began to cry
Illustration The dragon flew away across the garden See page 8
The Chancellor and the Prime Minister and the Nurse all came running
to see what was the matter And when they saw the book they understood
and the Chancellor said You naughty little King Put him to bed
Nurse and let him think over what hes done
Perhaps my Lord said the Prime Minister wed better first find out
just exactly what he has done
Then Lionel in floods of tears said Its a Red Dragon and its gone
flying away to the hills and I am so sorry and oh do forgive me
But the Prime Minister and the Chancellor had other things to think of
than forgiving Lionel They hurried off to consult the police and see
what could be done Everyone did what they could They sat on committees
and stood on guard and lay in wait for the Dragon but he stayed up in
the hills and there was nothing more to be done The faithful Nurse
meanwhile did not neglect her duty Perhaps she did more than anyone
else for she slapped the King and put him to bed without his tea and
when it got dark she would not give him a candle to read by
You are a naughty little King she said and nobody will love you
Next day the Dragon was still quiet though the more poetic of Lionels
subjects could see the redness of the Dragon shining through the green
trees quite plainly So Lionel put on his crown and sat on his throne
and said he wanted to make some laws
And I need hardly say that though the Prime Minister and the Chancellor
and the Nurse might have the very poorest opinion of Lionels private
judgement and might even slap him and send him to bed the minute he
got on his throne and set his crown on his head he became
infalliblewhich means that everything he said was right and that he
couldnt possibly make a mistake So when he said There is to be a law
forbidding people to open books in schools or elsewherehe had the
support of at least half of his subjects and the other halfthe
grownup halfpretended to think he was quite right
Then he made a law that everyone should always have enough to eat And
this pleased everyone except the ones who had always had too much
And when several other nice new laws were made and written down he went
home and made mudhouses and was very happy And he said to his Nurse
People will love me now Ive made such a lot of pretty new laws for
them
But Nurse said Dont count your chickens my dear You havent seen
the last of that Dragon yet
Now the next day was Saturday And in the afternoon the Dragon suddenly
swooped down upon the common in all his hideous redness and carried off
the Soccer Players umpires goalposts ball and all
Then the people were very angry indeed and they said We might as well
be a Republic After saving up all these years to get his crown and
everything
And wise people shook their heads and foretold a decline in the National
Love of Sport And indeed soccer was not at all popular for some time
afterward
Lionel did his best to be a good King during the week and the people
were beginning to forgive him for letting the Dragon out of the book
After all they said soccer is a dangerous game and perhaps it is
wise to discourage it
Popular opinion held that the Soccer Players being tough and hard had
disagreed with the Dragon so much that he had gone away to some place
where they only play cats cradle and games that do not make you hard
and tough
All the same Parliament met on the Saturday afternoon a convenient
time for most of the Members would be free to attend to consider the
Dragon But unfortunately the Dragon who had only been asleep woke up
because it was Saturday and he considered the Parliament and
afterwards there were not any Members left so they tried to make a new
Parliament but being a member of Parliament had somehow grown as
unpopular as soccer playing and no one would consent to be elected so
they had to do without a Parliament When the next Saturday came around
everyone was a little nervous but the Red Dragon was pretty quiet that
day and only ate an Orphanage
Lionel was very very unhappy He felt that it was his disobedience that
had brought this trouble on the Parliament and the Orphanage and the
Soccer Players and he felt that it was his duty to try and do
something The question was what
The Blue Bird that had come out of the book used to sing very nicely in
the Palace rose garden and the Butterfly was very tame and would perch
on his shoulder when he walked among the tall lilies so Lionel saw that
all the creatures in The Book of Beasts could not be wicked like the
Dragon and he thought Suppose I could get another beast out who would
fight the Dragon
So he took The Book of Beasts out into the rose garden and opened the
page next to the one where the Dragon had been just a tiny bit to see
what the name was He could only see cora but he felt the middle of
the page swelling up thick with the creature that was trying to come
out and it was only by putting the book down and sitting on it
suddenly very hard that he managed to get it shut Then he fastened
the clasps with the rubies and turquoises in them and sent for the
Chancellor who had been ill since Saturday and so had not been eaten
with the rest of the Parliament and he said What animal ends in
cora
The Chancellor answered The Manticora of course
What is he like asked the King
He is the sworn foe of Dragons said the Chancellor He drinks their
blood He is yellow with the body of a lion and the face of a man I
wish we had a few Manticoras here now But the last died hundreds of
years agoworse luck
Then the King ran and opened the book at the page that had cora on it
and there was the pictureManticora all yellow with a lions body and
a mans face just as the Chancellor had said And under the picture
was written Manticora
In a few minutes the Manticora came sleepily out of the book rubbing
its eyes with its hands and mewing piteously It seemed very stupid and
when Lionel gave it a push and said Go along and fight the Dragon
do it put its tail between its legs and fairly ran away It went and
hid behind the Town Hall and at night when the people were asleep it
went around and ate all the pussycats in the town And then it mewed
more than ever And on the Saturday morning when people were a little
timid about going out because the Dragon had no regular hour for
calling the Manticora went up and down the streets and drank all the
milk that was left in the cans at the doors for peoples teas and it
ate the cans as well
And just when it had finished the very last little halfpenny worth
which was short measure because the milkmans nerves were quite upset
the Red Dragon came down the street looking for the Manticora It edged
off when it saw him coming for it was not at all the Dragonfighting
kind and seeing no other door open the poor hunted creature took
refuge in the General Post Office and there the Dragon found it trying
to conceal itself among the ten oclock mail The Dragon fell on the
Manticora at once and the mail was no defense The mewings were heard
all over the town All the kitties and the milk the Manticora had had
seemed to have strengthened its mew wonderfully Then there was a sad
silence and presently the people whose windows looked that way saw the
Dragon come walking down the steps of the General Post Office spitting
fire and smoke together with tufts of Manticora fur and the fragments
of the registered letters Things were growing very serious However
popular the King might become during the week the Dragon was sure to do
something on Saturday to upset the peoples loyalty
Illustration The Manticora took refuge in the General Post Office
See page 13
The Dragon was a perfect nuisance for the whole of Saturday except
during the hour of noon and then he had to rest under a tree or he
would have caught fire from the heat of the sun You see he was very
hot to begin with
At last came a Saturday when the Dragon actually walked into the Royal
nursery and carried off the Kings own pet Rocking Horse Then the King
cried for six days and on the seventh he was so tired that he had to
stop He heard the Blue Bird singing among the roses and saw the
Butterfly fluttering among the lilies and he said Nurse wipe my
face please I am not going to cry any more
Nurse washed his face and told him not to be a silly little King
Crying said she never did anyone any good yet
I dont know said the little King I seem to see better and to hear
better now that Ive cried for a week Now Nurse dear I know Im
right so kiss me in case I never come back I must try to see if I
cant save the people
Well if you must you must said Nurse but dont tear your clothes
or get your feet wet
So off he went
The Blue Bird sang more sweetly than ever and the Butterfly shone more
brightly as Lionel once more carried The Book of Beasts out into the
rose garden and opened itvery quickly so that he might not be afraid
and change his mind The book fell open wide almost in the middle and
there was written at the bottom of the page Hippogriff and before
Lionel had time to see what the picture was there was a fluttering of
great wings and a stamping of hoofs and a sweet soft friendly
neighing and there came out of the book a beautiful white horse with a
long long white mane and a long long white tail and he had great
wings like swans wings and the softest kindest eyes in the world and
he stood there among the roses
The Hippogriff rubbed its silkysoft milky white nose against the
little Kings shoulder and the little King thought But for the wings
you are very like my poor dear lost Rocking Horse And the Blue Birds
song was very loud and sweet
Then suddenly the King saw coming through the sky the great straggling
sprawling wicked shape of the Red Dragon And he knew at once what he
must do He caught up The Book of Beasts and jumped on the back of the
gentle beautiful Hippogriff and leaning down he whispered in the
sharp white ear Fly dear Hippogriff fly your very fastest to the
Pebbly Waste
And when the Dragon saw them start he turned and flew after them with
his great wings flapping like clouds at sunset and the Hippogriffs
wide wings were snowy as clouds at moonrise
When the people in the town saw the Dragon fly off after the Hippogriff
and the King they all came out of their houses to look and when they
saw the two disappear they made up their minds to the worst and began
to think what they would wear for Court mourning
But the Dragon could not catch the Hippogriff The red wings were bigger
than the white ones but they were not so strong and so the
whitewinged horse flew away and away and away with the Dragon
pursuing till he reached the very middle of the Pebbly Waste
Now the Pebbly Waste is just like the parts of the seaside where there
is no sandall round loose shifting stones and there is no grass
there and no tree within a hundred miles of it
Lionel jumped off the white horses back in the very middle of the
Pebbly Waste and he hurriedly unclasped The Book of Beasts and laid
it open on the pebbles Then he clattered among the pebbles in his haste
to get back on to his white horse and had just jumped on when up came
the Dragon He was flying very feebly and looking around everywhere for
a tree for it was just on the stroke of twelve the sun was shining
like a gold guinea in the blue sky and there was not a tree for a
hundred miles
The whitewinged horse flew around and around the Dragon as he writhed
on the dry pebbles He was getting very hot indeed parts of him even
had begun to smoke He knew that he must certainly catch fire in
another minute unless he could get under a tree He made a snatch with
his red claws at the King and Hippogriff but he was too feeble to reach
them and besides he did not dare to overexert himself for fear he
should get any hotter
It was then that he saw The Book of Beasts lying on the pebbles open
at the page with Dragon written at the bottom He looked and he
hesitated and he looked again and then with one last squirm of rage
the Dragon wriggled himself back into the picture and sat down under the
palm tree and the page was a little singed as he went in
As soon as Lionel saw that the Dragon had really been obliged to go and
sit under his own palm tree because it was the only tree there he
jumped off his horse and shut the book with a bang
Oh hurrah he cried Now we really have done it
And he clasped the book very tightly with the turquoise and ruby clasps
Oh my precious Hippogriff he cried You are the bravest dearest
most beautiful
Hush whispered the Hippogriff modestly Dont you see that we are
not alone
And indeed there was quite a crowd round them on the Pebbly Waste the
Prime Minister and the Parliament and the Soccer Players and the
Orphanage and the Manticora and the Rocking Horse and indeed everyone
who had been eaten by the Dragon You see it was impossible for the
Dragon to take them into the book with himit was a tight fit even for
one Dragonso of course he had to leave them outside
They all got home somehow and all lived happy ever after
When the King asked the Manticora where he would like to live he begged
to be allowed to go back into the book I do not care for public life
he said
Of course he knew his way onto his own page so there was no danger of
his opening the book at the wrong page and letting out a Dragon or
anything So he got back into his picture and has never come out since
That is why you will never see a Manticora as long as you live except
in a picturebook And of course he left the kitties outside because
there was no room for them in the bookand the milk cans too
Then the Rocking Horse begged to be allowed to go and live on the
Hippogriffs page of the book I should like he said to live
somewhere where Dragons cant get at me
So the beautiful whitewinged Hippogriff showed him the way in and
there he stayed till the King had him taken out for his
greatgreatgreatgreatgrandchildren to play with
As for the Hippogriff he accepted the position of the Kings Own
Rocking Horsea situation left vacant by the retirement of the wooden
one And the Blue Bird and the Butterfly sing and flutter among the
lilies and roses of the Palace garden to this very day
Illustration UNCLE JAMES OR THE PURPLE STRANGER
II Uncle James or The Purple Stranger
The Princess and the gardeners boy were playing in the backyard
What will you do when you grow up Princess asked the gardeners boy
I should like to marry you Tom said the Princess Would you mind
No said the gardeners boy I shouldnt mind much Ill marry you if
you likeif I have time
For the gardeners boy meant as soon as he was grown up to be a
general and a poet and a Prime Minister and an admiral and a civil
engineer Meanwhile he was top of all his classes at school and
tiptop of the geography class
As for the Princess Mary Ann she was a very good little girl and
everyone loved her She was always kind and polite even to her Uncle
James and to other people whom she did not like very much and though
she was not very clever for a Princess she always tried to do her
lessons Even if you know perfectly well that you cant do your lessons
you may as well try and sometimes you find that by some fortunate
accident they really are done Then the Princess had a truly good
heart She was always kind to her pets She never slapped her
hippopotamus when it broke her dolls in its playful gambols and she
never forgot to feed her rhinoceroses in their little hutch in the
backyard Her elephant was devoted to her and sometimes Mary Ann made
her nurse quite cross by smuggling the dear little thing up to bed with
her and letting it go to sleep with its long trunk laid lovingly across
her throat and its pretty head cuddled under the Royal right ear
When the Princess had been good all through the weekfor like all
real live nice children she was sometimes naughty but never
badNurse would allow her to ask her little friends to come on
Wednesday morning early and spend the day because Wednesday is the end
of the week in that country Then in the afternoon when all the little
dukes and duchesses and marquises and countesses had finished their rice
pudding and had had their hands and faces washed after it Nurse would
say Now my dears what would you like to do this afternoon just as
if she didnt know And the answer would be always the same
Oh do lets go to the Zoological Gardens and ride on the big guinea
pig and feed the rabbits and hear the dormouse asleep
So their pinafores were taken off and they all went to the Zoological
Gardens where twenty of them could ride at a time on the guinea pig
and where even the little ones could feed the great rabbits if some
grownup person were kind enough to lift them up for the purpose
There always was some such person because in Rotundia everybody was
kindexcept one
Now that you have read as far as this you know of course that the
Kingdom of Rotundia was a very remarkable place and if you are a
thoughtful childas of course you areyou will not need me to tell you
what was the most remarkable thing about it But in case you are not a
thoughtful childand it is just possible of course that you are notI
will tell you at once what that most remarkable thing was All the
animals were the wrong sizes And this was how it happened
In old old olden times when all our world was just loose earth and
air and fire and water mixed up anyhow like a pudding and spinning
around like mad trying to get the different things to settle into their
proper places a round piece of earth got loose and went spinning away
by itself across the water which was just beginning to try to get
spread out smooth into a real sea And as the great round piece of earth
flew away going around and around as hard as it could it met a long
piece of hard rock that had got loose from another part of the puddingy
