THE
LIVES
OF THE
POETS
EUSTACE BUDGELL Esq
was the eldest son of Gilbert Budgell DD of St Thomas near Exeter
by his first wife Mary the only daughter of Dr William Gulston bishop
of Bristol whose sister Jane married dean Addison and was mother to
the famous Mr Addison the secretary of state This family of Budgell is
very old and has been settled and known in Devonshire above 200
years1
Eustace was born about the year 1685 and distinguished himself very
soon at school from whence he was removed early to Christs Church
College in Oxford where he was entered a gentleman commoner He staid
some years in that university and afterwards went to London where by
his fathers directions he was entered of the InnerTemple in order to
be bred to the Bar for which his father had always intended him but
instead of the Law he followed his own inclinations which carried him
to the study of polite literature and to the company of the genteelest
people in town This proved unlucky for the father by degrees grew
uneasy at his sons not getting himself called to the Bar nor properly
applying to the Law according to his reiterated directions and request
and the son complained of the strictness and insufficiency of his
fathers allowance and constantly urged the necessity of his living
like a gentleman and of his spending a great deal of money During this
slay however at the Temple Mr Budgell made a strict intimacy and
friendship with Mr Addison who was first cousin to his mother and
this last gentleman being appointed in the year 1710 secretary to lord
Wharton the lord lieutenant of Ireland he made an offer to his friend
Eustace of going with him as one of the clerks in his office The
proposal being advantageous and Mr Budgell being then on bad terms
with his father and absolutely unqualified for the practice of the Law
it was readily accepted Nevertheless for fear of his fathers
disapprobation of it he never communicated his design to him till the
very night of his setting out for Ireland when he wrote him a letter
to inform him at once of his resolution and journey This was in the
beginning of April 1710 when he was about twenty five years of age He
had by this time read the classics the most reputed historians and all
the best French English or Italian writers His apprehension was
quick his imagination fine and his memory remarkably strong though
his greatest commendations were a very genteel address a ready wit and
an excellent elocution which shewed him to advantage wherever he went
There was notwithstanding one principal defect in his disposition and
this was an infinite vanity which gave him so insufferable a
presumption as led him to think that nothing was too much for his
capacity nor any preferment or favour beyond his deserts Mr
Addisons fondness for him perhaps increased this disposition as he
naturally introduced him into all the company he kept which at that
time was the best and most ingenious in the two kingdoms In short
they lived and lodged together and constantly followed the lord
lieutenant into England at the same time
It was now that Mr Budgell commenced author and was partly concerned
with Sir Richard Steele and Mr Addison in writing the Tatler The
Spectators being set on foot in 171011 Mr Budgell had likewise a
share in them as all the papers marked with an X may easily inform the
reader and indeed the eighth volume was composed by Mr Addison and
himself2 without the assistance of Sir Richard Steele The
speculations of our author were generally liked and Mr Addison was
frequently complimented upon the ingenuity of his kinsman About the
same time he wrote an epilogue to the Distressd Mother3 which had a
greater run than any thing of that kind ever had before and has had
this peculiar regard shewn to it since that now above thirty years
afterwards it is generally spoke at the representation of that play
Several little epigrams and songs which have a good deal of wit in
them were also written by Mr Budgell near this period of time all
which together with the known affection of Mr Addison for him raised
his character so much as to make him be very generally known and talked
of
His fathers death in 1711 threw into his hands all the estates of the
family which were about 950 l a year although they were left
incumbered with some debts as his father was a man of pride and spirit
kept a coach and six and always lived beyond his income
notwithstanding his spiritual preferments and the money he had received
with his wives Dr Budgell had been twice married and by his first
lady left five children living after him three of whom were sons
Eustace our author Gilbert a Clergyman and William the fellow of
New College in Oxford By his last wife who was Mrs Fortescue mother
to the late master of the rolls and who survived him he had no issue
Notwithstanding this access of fortune Mr Budgell in no wise altered
his manner of living he was at small expence about his person stuck
very close to business and gave general satisfaction in the discharge
of his office
Upon the laying down of the Spectator the Guardian was set up and in
this work our author had a hand along with Mr Addison and Sir Richard
Steele In the preface it is said those papers marked with an asterisk
are by Mr Budgell
In the year 1713 he published a very elegant translation of
Theophrastuss Characters which Mr Addison in the Lover says is the
best version extant of any ancient author in the English language It
was dedicated to the lord Hallifax who was the greatest patron our
author ever had and with whom he always lived in the greatest intimacy
Mr Budgell having regularly made his progress in the secretary of
States office in Ireland upon the arrival of his late Majesty in
England was appointed under secretary to Mr Addison and chief
secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland He was made likewise deputy
clerk of the council in that kingdom and soon after chose member of the
Irish parliament where he became a very good speaker The post of under
secretary is reckoned worth 1500 l a year and that of deputy clerk to
the council 250 l a year Mr Budgell set out for Ireland the 8th of
October 1714 officiated in his place in the privy council the 14th
took possession of the secretarys office and was immediately admitted
secretary to the Lords Justices In the same year at a public
entertainment at the Inns of Court in Dublin he with many people of
distinction was made an honorary bencher At his first entering upon
the secretarys place after the removal of the tories on the accession
of his late Majesty he lay under very great difficulties all the
former clerks of his office refusing to serve all the books with the
form of business being secreted and every thing thrown into the utmost
confusion yet he surmounted these difficulties with very uncommon
resolution assiduity and ability to his great honour and applause
Within a twelvemonth of his entering upon his employments the rebellion
broke out and as for several years during all the absences of the
lord lieutenant he had discharged the office of secretary of state and
as no transport office at that time subsisted he was extraordinarily
charged with the care of the embarkation and the providing of shipping
which is generally the province of a fieldofficer for all the troops
to be transported to Scotland However he went through this extensive
and unusual complication of business with great exactness and ability
and with very singular disinterestedness for he took no extraordinary
service money on this account nor any gratuity or fees for any of the
commissions which passed through his office for the colonels and
officers of militia then raising in Ireland The Lords Justices pressed
him to draw up a warrant for a very handsome present on account of his
great zeal and late extraordinary pains for he had often sat up whole
nights in his office but he very genteely and firmly refused it
Mr Addison upon becoming principal secretary of state in England in
1717 procured the place of accomptant and comptroller general of the
revenue in Ireland for Mr Budgell which is worth 400 l a year and
might have had him for his under secretary but it was thought more
expedient for his Majestys service that Mr Budgell should continue
where he was Our author held these several places until the year 1718
at which time the duke of Bolton was appointed lord lieutenant His
grace carried one Mr Edward Webster over with him who had been an
under clerk in the Treasury and made him a privy counsellor and his
secretary This gentleman twas said insisted upon the quartering a
friend on the under secretary which produced a misunderstanding between
them for Mr Budgell positively declared he would never submit to any
such condition whilst he executed the office and affected to treat Mr
Webster himself his education abilities and family with the utmost
contempt He was indiscreet enough prior to this to write a lampoon
in which the lord lieutenant was not spared he would publish it so
fond was he of this brat of his brain in opposition to Mr Addisons
opinion who strongly persuaded him to suppress it as the publication
Mr Addison said could neither serve his interest or reputation Hence
many discontents arose between them till at length the lord
lieutenant in support of his secretary superseded Mr Budgell and
very soon after got him removed from the place of accomptantgeneral
However upon the first of these removals taking place and upon some
hints being given by his private secretary captain Guy Dickens now our
minister at Stockholm that it would not probably be safe for him to
remain any longer in Ireland he immediately entrusted his papers and
private concerns to the hands of his brother William then a clerk in
his office and set out for England Soon after his arrival he published
a pamphlet representing his case intituled A Letter to the Lord
from Eustace Budgell Esq Accomptant General of Ireland and late
Secretary to their Excellencies the Lords Justices of that Kingdom
eleven hundred copies of which were sold off in one day so great was
the curiosity of the public in that particular Afterwards too in the
PostBoy of January 17 171819 he published an Advertisement to
justify his character against a report that had been spread to his
disadvantage and he did not scruple to declare in all companies that
his life was attempted by his enemies or otherwise he should have
attended his feat in the Irish Parliament His behaviour about this
time made many of his friends judge he was become delirious his
passions were certainly exceeding strong nor were his vanity and
jealousy less Upon his coming to England he had lost no time in waiting
upon Mr Addison who had resigned the seals and was retired into the
country for the sake of his health but Mr Addison found it impossible
to stem the tide of opposition which was every where running against
his kinsman through the influence and power of the duke of Bolton He
therefore disswaded him in the strongest manner from publishing his
case but to no manner of purpose which made him tell a friend in great
anxiety Mr Budgell was wiser than any man he ever knew and yet he
supposed the world would hardly believe he acted contrary to his
advice Our authors great and noble friend the lord Hallifax was dead
and my lord Orrery who held him in the highest esteem had it not in
his power to procure him any redress However Mr Addison had got a
promise from lord Sunderland that as soon as the present clamour was a
little abated he would do something for him
Mr Budgell had held the considerable places of under secretary to the
Lord Lieutenant and secretary to the Lords Justices for four years
during which time he had never been absent four days from his office
nor ten miles from Dublin His application was indefatigable and his
natural spirits capable of carrying him through any difficulty He had
lived always genteelly but frugally and had saved a large sum of
money which he now engaged in the SouthSea scheme During his abode in
Ireland he had collected materials for writing a History of that
kingdom for which he had great advantages by having an easy recourse
to all the public offices but what is become of it and whether he ever
finished it we are not certainly informed It is undoubtedly a
considerable loss because there is no tolerable history of that nation
and because we might have expected a satisfactory account from so
pleasing a writer
He wrote a pamphlet after he came to England against the famous
Peerage Bill which was very well received by the public but highly
offended the earl of Sunderland It was exceedingly cried up by the
opposition and produced some overtures of friendship at the time from
Mr Robert Walpole to our author Mr Addisons death in the year
1719 put an end however to all his hopes of succeeding at court
where he continued nevertheless to make several attempts but was
constantly kept down by the weight of the duke of Bolton In the
September of that year he went into France through all the strong
places in Flanders and Brabant and all the considerable towns in
Holland and then went to Hanover from whence he returned with his
Majestys retinue the November following
But the fatal year of the SouthSea 1720 ruined our author entirely
for he lost above 20000 l in it however he was very active on that
occasion and made many speeches at the general courts of the SouthSea
Company in MerchantTaylors Hall and one in particular which was
afterwards printed both in French and English and run to a third
edition And in 1721 he published a pamphlet with success called A
Letter to a Friend in the Country occasioned by a Report that there is
a Design still forming by the late Directors of the SouthSea Company
their Agents and Associates to issue the Receipts of the 3d and 4th
Subscriptions at 1000 l per Cent and to extort about 10 Millions more
from the miserable People of Great Britain with some Observations on
the present State of Affairs both at Home and Abroad In the same year
he published A Letter to Mr Law upon his Arrival in Great Britain
which run through seven editions very soon Not long afterwards the duke
of Portland whose fortune had been likewise destroyed by the SouthSea
was appointed governor of Jamaica upon which he immediately told Mr
Budgell he should go with him as his secretary and should always live
in the same manner with himself and that he would contrive every method
of making the employment profitable and agreeable to him but his grace
did not know how obnoxious our author had rendered himself for within a
few days after this offers taking air he was acquainted in form by a
secretary of state that if he thought of Mr Budgell the government
would appoint another governor in his room
After being deprived of this last resource he tried to get into the
next parliament at several places and spent near 5000 l in
unsuccessful attempts which compleated his ruin And from this period
he began to behave and live in a very different manner from what he had
ever done before wrote libellous pamphlets against Sir Robert Walpole
and the ministry and did many unjust things with respect to his
relations being distracted in his own private fortune as indeed he
was judged to be in his senses torturing his invention to find out
ways of subsisting and eluding his illstars his pride at the same time
working him up to the highest pitches of resentment and indignation
against all courts and courtiers
His younger brother the fellow of NewCollege who had more weight with
him than any body had been a clerk under him in Ireland and continued
still in the office and who bad fair for rising in it died in the year
1723 and after that our author seemed to pay no regard to any person
Mr William Budgell was a man of very good sense extremely steady in
his conduct and an adept in all calculations and mathematical
questions and had besides great goodnature and easiness of temper
Our author as I before observed perplexed his private affairs from this
time as much as possible and engaged in numberless lawsuits which
brought him into distresses that attended him to the end of his life
In 1727 Mr Budgell had a 1000 l given him by the late Sarah duchess
dowager of Marlborough to whose husband the famous duke of
Marlborough he was a relation by his mothers side with a view to his
getting into parliament She knew he had a talent for speaking in
public and that he was acquainted with business and would probably run
any lengths against the ministry However this scheme failed for he
could never get chosen
In the year 1730 and about that time he closed in with the writers
against the administration and wrote many papers in the Craftsman He
likewise published a pamphlet intitled A Letter to the Craftsman
from E Budgell Esq occasioned by his late presenting an humble
complaint against the right honourable Sir Robert Walpole with a
Postscript This ran to a ninth edition Near the same time too he
wrote a Letter to Cleomenes King of Sparta from E Budgell Esq being
an Answer Paragraph by Paragraph to his Spartan Majestys Royal Epistle
published some time since in the Daily Courant with some Account of the
Manners and Government of the Antient Greeks and Romans and Political
Reflections thereon And not long after there came out A State of one of
the Authors Cases before the House of Lords which is generally printed
with the Letter to Cleomenes He likewise published on the same occasion
a pamphlet which he calls Liberty and Property by E Budgell Esq
wherein he complains of the seizure and loss of many valuable papers
and particularly a collection of Letters from Mr Addison lord
Hallifax Sir Richard Steele and other people which he designed to
publish and soon after he printed a sequel or second part under the
same title
The same year he also published his Poem upon his Majestys Journey to
Cambridge and Newmarket and dedicated it to the Queen Another of his
performances is a poetical piece intitled A Letter to his Excellency
Ulrick DYpres and C in Answer to his excellencys two Epistles in
the Daily Courant with a Word or Two to Mr Osborn the Hyp Doctor and
C These several performances were very well received by the public
In the year 1733 he began a weekly pamphlet in the nature of a
Magazine though more judiciously composed called The Bee which he
continued for about 100 Numbers that bind into eight Volumes Octavo
but at last by quarrelling with his booksellers and filling his
pamphlet with things entirely relating to himself he was obliged to
drop it During the progress of this work Dr Tindalls death happened
by whose will Mr Budgell had 2000 l left him and the world being
surprised at such a gift immediately imputed it to his making the will
himself This produced a paperwar between him and Mr Tindall the
continuator of Rapin by which Mr Budgells character considerably
suffered and this occasioned his Bees being turned into a meer
vindication of himself
It is thought he had some hand in publishing Dr Tindalls Christianity
as old as the Creation and he often talked of another additional volume
on the same subject but never published it However he used to enquire
very frequently after Dr Conybears health who had been employed by
her late majesty to answer the first and had been rewarded with the
deanery of ChristChurch for his pains saying he hoped Mr Dean would
live a little while longer that he might have the pleasure of making
him a bishop for he intended very soon to publish the other volume of
Tindall which would do the business Mr Budgell promised likewise a
volume of several curious pieces of Tindalls that had been committed
to his charge with the life of the doctor but never fulfilled his
promise4
During the publication of the Bee a smart pamphlet came out called A
Short History of Prime Ministers which was generally believed to be
written by our author and in the same year he published A Letter to the
Merchants and Tradesmen of London and Bristol upon their late glorious
behaviour against the Excise Law
After the extinction of the Bee our author became so involved with
