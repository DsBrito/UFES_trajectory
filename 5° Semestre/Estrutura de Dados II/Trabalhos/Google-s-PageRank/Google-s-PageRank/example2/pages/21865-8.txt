Illustration HOW ARTHUR BECAME KING
Once upon a time a thousand years before Columbus discovered
America and when Rome was still the greatest city in the world
there lived a brave and beautiful youth whose name was Arthur
His home was in England near London and he lived with the good
knight Sir Hector whom he always called father
They dwelt in a great square castle of gray stone with a round
tower at each corner It was built about a courtyard and was
surrounded by a moat across which was a drawbridge that could be
raised or lowered When it was raised the castle was practically
a little island and very hard for enemies to attack
On one side of the moat was a large wood and here Arthur spent a
great deal of his time He liked to lie under the trees and gaze
up at the blue of the sky All about him old oaks stood like
giant guardians watching sturdily over the soil where they had
grown for centuries Arthur could look between the trunks and see
rabbits and squirrels whisking about Sometimes a herd of brown
deer with shy dark eyes would pass holding their graceful heads
high in the air sometimes a flock of pheasants with brilliant
plumage rose from the bushes Again there was no sound except the
tapping of a brightcrested woodpecker and no motion but the
fluttering of leaves and the trembling of violets half buried in
green moss
At times when it was dim and silent in the wood Arthur would
hear bursts of merry laughter the tinkling of bells and the
jingling of spurs Then he would know that knights and ladies
were riding down the road which ran beside the trees Soon the
knights would appear on horses brown black and white with
gaily ornamented saddles and bridles from which hung silver
bells Often the saddles were made of ivory or ebony set with
rubies or emeralds The knights wore helmets laced with slender
gold chains and coats of mail made of tiny links of steel so
fine and light that all together hardly weighed more than a coat
of cloth Usually the legs of the knights were sheathed in steel
armor and their spurs were steel or even gold The ladies sat
on horses with long trappings of silk purple white or scarlet
with ornamented saddles and swinging bells The robes of the
ladies were very beautiful being made of velvet or silk trimmed
with ermine Arthur liked to watch them flashing by crimson
and gold and blue and rosecolored Better still he liked to
see the pretty happy faces of the ladies and hear their gay
voices In those troublous times however the roads were so
insecure that such companies did not often pass
Sometimes the knights and ladies came to visit Sir Hector Then
Arthur would hurry from the forest to the castle Sir Hector
would stand on the lowered drawbridge to greet his guests and
would lead them with many expressions of pleasure into the
courtyard Then he would take a huge hammer hanging from a post
and beat with it on a table which stood in a corner of the
courtyard Immediately from all parts of the castle the squires
and servants would come running to take the horses of the knights
and ladies Sir Hectors wife and daughters would then appear
and with their own hands remove the armor of the knights They
would offer them golden basins of water and towels for washing
and after that put velvet mantles upon their shoulders Then the
guests would be brought to the supper table
But Arthur did not spend all his time dreaming in the woods or
gazing at knights and ladies For many hours of the day he
practiced feats of arms in the courtyard It was the custom in
England to train boys of noble birth to be knights As soon as
they were old enough they were taught to ride Later on they
lived much among the ladies and maidens learning gentle manners
Under the care of the knights they learned to hunt to carry a
lance properly and to use the sword and having gained this
skill they were made squires if they had shown themselves to be
of good character
Then day by day the squires practiced at the quintain This was
an upright post on the top of which turned a crosspiece having
on one end a broad board and on the other a bag of sand The
object was to ride up at full gallop strike the board with a
long lance and get away without being hit by the sand bag
Besides this the squires had services to do for the knights in
order that they might learn to be useful in as many ways as
possible and to be always humble For instance they took care
of the armor of the knights carried letters and messages for
them accompanied them at joustings and tournaments being ready
with extra weapons or assistance and in the castle they helped
to serve the guests at table After months of such service they
went through a beautiful ceremony and were made knights In the
country round about Arthur of all the squires was the most
famous for his skill in the use of the lance and the sword for
his keenness in the hunt and for his courtesy to all people
Now at this time there was no ruler in England The powerful
Uther of Wales who had governed England was dead and all the
strong lords of the country were struggling to be king in his
place This gave rise to a great deal of quarreling and
bloodshed
There was in the land a wise magician named Merlin He was so old
that his beard was as white as snow but his eyes were as clear
as a little childs He was very sorry to see all the fighting
that was going on because he feared that it would do serious
harm to the kingdom
In those days the great and good men who ruled in the church had
power almost equal to that of the monarch The kings and the
great lords listened to their advice and gave them much land
and money for themselves and for the poor So Merlin went to the
Archbishop of Canterbury the churchman who in all England was
the most beloved and said
Sir it is my advice that you send to all the great lords of the
realm and bid them come to London by Christmas to choose a king
The archbishop did as Merlin advised and at Christmas all the
great lords came to London The largest church in the city stood
not far from the north bank of the Thames A churchyard
surrounded it filled with yew trees the trunks of which were
knotted with age The powerful lords rode up in their clanking
armor to the gate where they dismounted and giving their horses
into the care of their squires reverently entered the church
There were so many of them that they quite filled the nave and
sideaisles of the building The good archbishop from where he
stood in the chancel looked down on them all Just behind him
was the altar covered with a cloth of crimson and gold and
surmounted by a golden crucifix and ten burning candles In front
of him kneeling under the gray arches which spanned the church
were the greatest men in the kingdom He looked at their stern
bronzed faces their heavy beards their broad shoulders and
their glittering armor and prayed God to make the best man in
the land king
Then began the service At the close of the first prayer some of
the knights looked out of the window and there in the churchyard
they saw a great square stone In the middle of it was an anvil
of steel a foot high and fixed therein was a beautiful sword On
the sword was some writing set in with gold which said
Whosoever pulls this sword out of this stone and anvil is the
real king of all England
The knights who read this told the archbishop but he said
I command you all to keep within the church and still pray to
God No man is to touch the sword until all the prayers are
said
After the service was over the lords went into the churchyard
They each pulled at the sword but none could stir it
The king is not here said the archbishop but God will make
him known Meantime let ten good knights keep watch over this
sword
The knights were soon chosen and then the archbishop said that
on a fixed day every man in the kingdom should try to pull the
sword out of the anvil He ordered that on New Years day all the
people should be brought together for a great tournament to be
held on the south bank of the Thames near London bridge After a
few days spent in jousting among the knights each man should
make the trial to find out whether or not he was to be king
The brave youth Arthur did not know of the contest that was to be
made for the sword Sir Hector told him that he was to go to a
tournament but he did not tell him the reason for holding the
tournament So Arthur rode to London with Sir Hector and Sir
Kay who was Sir Hectors oldest son was with them
Sir Hector and Sir Kay rode soberly in front They were tall
stalwart men and rode black horses their dark figures making
shadows on the light snow that had fallen Arthur riding behind
them felt exhilarated by the crisp winter air which caused the
blood to dance in his veins Sometimes he stood up in his saddle
and flicked with his sword the dead leaves on the oaks Again he
made his horse crush the thin crust of ice that had formed in
tiny pools on the road He was so happy in the thought of the
tournament he was to see that he could have sung for joy
The road was not very wide for few carts passed upon it but it
had been well worn by riders Sometimes it wound through a bit of
thick woods again it rose up over a gently rolling hill From
the hilltops the riders could see London far in the distance It
looked at first like a gray haze then as the three came nearer
the buildings large and small grew plain to the sight The
castles and huts barns and sheds smithies shops and mills
stood out in the keen sunlight A high wall surrounded them
while on one side flowed the river Thames
After they had entered the city and had passed the churchyard
and had almost reached London bridge Sir Kay discovered that he
had left his sword at home
Will you go back for it he asked Arthur
That I will said Arthur glad of the chance to ride longer in
the delightful air
But when he reached their dwelling he could not get in The
drawbridge was raised and he could not make the warden hear his
calling Then Arthur was disturbed and said to himself
I will hasten to the churchyard we passed and take the
beautiful sword which I saw in the stone It does not seem to
belong to anyone and my brother Kay must have a weapon
So he rode on till he reached the churchyard dismounted and
tied his horse to a sapling The ten knights who guarded the
sword had gone away to see the combats in the tournament Arthur
ran up and pulled lightly but eagerly at the sword It came at
once from the anvil He hurried to Sir Kay who was waiting for
him on London bridge Sir Kay knew that the weapon was the one
that had been fixed fast in the stone but he said nothing to
Arthur and the two soon overtook Sir Hector who had ridden
slowly to the field where the tournament was taking place Sir
Kay immediately told his father what had happened
The good knight at once spoke with great respect to Arthur
Sir he said you must be the king of this land
What mean you sir asked Arthur
Sir Hector told the wondering youth the reason why he was
destined to be king Then he said
Can you put this sword back in its place and pull it out again
Easily replied Arthur
The three returned to the great stone and Arthur put back the
sword Sir Hector tried to take it out but failed
Now you try he said to Sir Kay
But Sir Kay in spite of great efforts also failed Then Arthur
at Sir Hectors bidding tried and at once pulled forth the
sword At that Sir Hector and Sir Kay knelt before Arthur
Alas said Arthur raising them from the ground my own dear
father and my brother why do you kneel to me
Nay my lord Arthur said Sir Hector I am not your father
You are of higher blood than I am Long ago when you were a
little baby Merlin brought you to me to take care of telling me
that you were to be the king
Then whose son am I cried Arthur
There are two stories the one that Merlin tells and the one
that old Bleys the master of Merlin tells Merlin brought you
to me saying that you were the son of King Uther and Yguerne his
wife But because the king was dead and the lords powerful and
jealous he told me to guard you in secrecy lest your life be
taken I did not know whether the story was true or false then
but you were a helpless child and Merlin was a wise sage and so
I took you and brought you up as my own
Arthur was so astonished that he did not ask to hear the tale
that Bleys told He stood gazing at Sir Hector who said
And now my gracious lord will you be good to me and mine when
you are king
I will indeed replied Arthur for I am more beholden to you
than to any one else in the world and also to my good lady and
foster mother your wife who has reared me as if I were her own
child If it be Gods will that I shall sometime become king ask
of me then what you will
Sir said Sir Hector I ask that you make my son Sir Kay your
foster brother the steward of all your lands
That shall be done said Arthur and more He shall have that
office as long as I live
Then the three went to the Archbishop of Canterbury and related
to him the story of Merlin and all that had occurred At his
request they told no one else
At the command of the archbishop on Twelfth day which is the
sixth of January all the great lords assembled in the churchyard
Each tried to draw forth the sword and each failed Then the
untitled people came and tried Everyone failed until at last
Arthur stepped forward He hardly more than touched the sword
when it came away in his hand
At this many of the great lords were angry
Illustration He hardly more than touched the sword
He is but a boy they said and not of high blood
They refused to believe the story of his birth told by Merlin and
Sir Hector And because of all the quarreling it was decided to
have another trial at Candlemas which fell in the month of
February Again Arthur was victorious Then the great lords
decreed that there should be another trial at Easter and again
Arthur succeeded Next they decided to have a final trial at the
feast of the Pentecost which fell in May
Meanwhile Merlin advised the archbishop to see that Arthur had a
bodyguard So the archbishop selected several knights whom the
former king Uther had trusted These were Sir Ulfius and Sir
Brastias and Sir Bedivere Sir Geraint and Sir Hector and Sir Kay
were also chosen These brave men formed a bodyguard for Arthur
until the feast of the Pentecost
At this time Arthur again drew out the sword from the anvil Then
the common people who had so far let the lords have their will
cried out
We will have Arthur for our king and we will have no more
delay for we see that it is Gods will that he shall be our
ruler
Then all the people knelt down high and low rich and poor and
begged Arthurs pardon for the delay he had undergone Arthur
forgave them and taking his sword reverently placed it on the
great altar beside which the archbishop stood This was a sign
that he meant to dedicate himself and his sword to God
Afterward the crowning was held and all the brave men and fair
ladies in the land were present The lords wore beautiful robes
of velvet and ermine with gold and jewels on their breastplates
The ladies robes were of purple and white and scarlet and gold
and blue and they wore many pearls and rubies and diamonds so
that all the place where they were assembled was glowing with
light and color
But Arthur who wore a plain white robe did not think of the
beauty and richness He was very grave knowing that he was about
to take a solemn oath He bowed his head while the archbishop
set upon it the golden crown which gleamed with jewels Then he
stood up before his people and vowed that he would be a good
king and always do justice All the people uncovered their heads
and vowed to serve and obey him and when he smiled kindly on
them as he rode slowly through the throng they threw up their
caps and shouted joyfully Long live King Arthur Long live the
King
King Arthur chose worthy men for his officers making Sir Kay
steward as he had promised Sir Ulfius he made chamberlain and
Sir Brastias warden Arthur gave offices also to Sir Hector and
Sir Bedivere and Sir Geraint
After his crowning the king set about righting all the wrongs
that had been done since the death of King Uther He gave back
the lands and money that had been taken from widows and orphans
and would permit no unkindness to any of his subjects Thus at
the very beginning of his reign his people began to call him
Good King Arthur
Illustration THE GOOD SWORD EXCALIBUR
Soon after the crowning of King Arthur he was journeying through
the land with Merlin the wise old magician when they met a
knight who challenged Arthur to a combat The two fought and at
last the knight wounded Arthur severely In the end the king was
victorious but he had lost so much blood that he could go no
farther Merlin took him to a good hermit who healed his wound in
three days Then the king departed with Merlin and as they were
slowly riding along he said
I am still weak from the blood I have lost and my sword is
broken
Do not fear said Merlin You shall lose no more blood and
you shall have a good sword Ride on trustfully with me
They rode in silence until they came to a lake large and quiet
and as beautiful in color as a pearl While Arthur was looking at
its beauty he became suddenly aware of three tall women with
fair sweet faces standing on the bank
Who are they the king asked
Three queens who shall help you at your worst need answered
Merlin Now look out upon the lake again
Arthur turned his eyes upon the lake and saw that in the distance
a slight mist had arisen Through it the figure of a lady glided
over the surface of the water Her robe appeared to be made of
waves which streamed away in flowing curves from her body Her
head and shoulders seemed wrapped in foam tinted with the colors
of the rainbow and her arms glittered with sparkles which came
from bubbles of water She was so wonderful that Arthur looked at
her for some time before he asked softly
Who is she
Illustration Arthur and the Lady of the Lake
She is the Lady of the Lake said Merlin She lives in a rock
in the middle of the lake See she is coming toward us Look at
what is beyond her in the water
Arthur looked and saw rising above the surface of the water an
arm clothed in pure white This arm held a huge crosshilted
sword so brilliant that Arthurs eyes were dazzled
When the Lady of the Lake approached nearer he said
Damsel what sword is that I wish it were mine for I have
none
The lady smiled saying
Step into yonder boat row to the sword and take it together
with the scabbard
So Arthur entered a little boat that was tied to the shore and
rowed out to the sword As he took it and the scabbard all
gleaming with jewels the hand and arm vanished into the water
And when Arthur looked about the three queens and the Lady of
the Lake were also gone
As Arthur still gazing at the sword rowed to shore Merlin said
to him
My lord Arthur which pleases you more sword or scabbard
In truth the sword replied the king
Let me assure you said Merlin smiling gravely that the
scabbard is worth ten of the sword While you have it with you
you shall never lose blood no no matter how sorely you are
wounded So see that you guard it well
The king who was looking at the sword sighed
There is writing on the sword he said
True my lord written in the oldest tongue in the world
Take me on one side said Arthur and Cast me away on the
other I am glad to take the sword but it saddens me to think of
casting it away
Merlins face grew sad too He was so wise that he knew what was
going to happen in the future and he was well aware that when
the time came to cast the sword away much evil would have
befallen the good King Arthur But he knew that the time was yet
very far off so he said
You have taken the sword Now use it to make justice and right
prevail in all the land Do not think of casting it away until
you must
Arthur grew joyful again as he felt the strength of the good
sword in his hand and the two rode cheerfully forward through
the country

Illustration THE GREAT FEAST  WHAT FOLLOWED
Although Arthur had been crowned king he was by no means sure
that all the nobles of the land would accept him as ruler In
accordance with the custom of the time he gave a feast in order
to find out who were his friends and who his enemies All who
came to the feast would he supposed consent to be his
followers
He chose the largest hall in London and had the walls hung with
rich cloths Upon the floor strewn with rushes were placed
trestles and across these boards were laid Upon them fine
white linen was spread and golden saltcellars winebowls and
waterjugs set about
When the guests assembled there were so many that Arthur was
delighted for he thought they were all his friends He sat at
the head of one table and Sir Hector sat at the head of the
other Arthur wore a gold crown on his head but it was no
brighter than his hair and the blue turquoises with which it was
set were no bluer than his eyes From his shoulders to the ground
hung a magnificent red robe with gold dragons embroidered upon
it
The cooks and squires came in from the kitchen carrying food
their ruddy faces beaming from the heat of the fires First of
all sixty boars heads were borne in on silver platters Then
followed on golden dishes peacocks and plovers which had been
so skillfully cooked that their bright colors were preserved
After the guests had eaten all they cared for of this food tiny
roasted pigs were brought in and set on all fours upon the
tables By this time all the gold and silver goblets which had
been filled with wine needed refilling Then the squires carried
in beautiful white swans on silver platters and roasted cranes
and curlews on plates that glowed like the sun After that came
rabbits stewed in sweet sauce and hams and curries The last
course consisted of tarts and preserves dates and figs and
pomegranates
The supper began about five oclock and the guests ate and drank
into the night Although it was past Easter time the weather was
a little cold and so upon the stone flagging between the two
long tables the king ordered fires to be lighted The bright
flames darted up flashing on the gold threads woven in the
hangings of the walls and on the steel armor of the lords and
gleaming on the jewels set in the gold and silver goblets which
the squires were carrying about At one side sat a band of
musicians singing of the glories of King Arthur and of the
folktales of his ancestors and people accompanying themselves
on their harps
After the guests had risen from the tables and gone to their
camps Arthur sent messengers to them with rich gifts of horses
and furs and gold But most of the lords received the messengers
scornfully
Take back these gifts to the beardless boy who has come of low
blood they said we do not want them We have come here to
give him gifts of hard blows with our hard swords
The messengers were astonished to hear these things spoken of
their good king Nevertheless they told Arthur all that had been
said to them He sent no answer back but he called together all
the lords whom he was sure were loyal to him and asked their
advice They said to him
We cannot give you advice but we can fight
You speak well my lords answered Arthur and I thank you for
your courage Will you take the advice of Merlin You know that
he has done much for me and he is very wise
The lords and barons answered that they would do whatever Merlin
advised When Merlin came to the council hall he said
I warn you that your enemies are very strong They have added to
their numbers so that now you have against you eleven mighty
kings
At this the lords looked dismayed
Unless our lord Arthur has more men than he can find in his own
realm said Merlin he will be overcome and slain Therefore I
give you this counsel There are two brothers across the sea
both are monarchs and both very strong One is King Ban of
Benwick and the other is King Bors of Gaul Now these two have
an enemy also a powerful ruler Therefore send to the brothers
King Bors and King Ban who are now both in Benwick and say to
them that if they will help Arthur in his war against the eleven
kings Arthur will help them against their common enemy
That is very good counsel said the king and the lords
So they chose Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias as messengers and
these two hurried away hopeful of success When they reached the
town in Benwick where King Bors and King Ban were knights came
forth to receive them and to hear their message As soon as it
was learned from whom they had come they were led into the
presence of the brothers Both were very large men King Bors
was dark and was dressed in black armor King Ban was dark too
the colors that he wore on his shield were green and gold He was
the father of Sir Lancelot the knight who afterwards became the
most powerful of the followers of Arthur
The two kings received Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias with much
favor
Tell King Arthur they said that we will come to him as
quickly as we can
Then they gave splendid gifts to Sir Ulfius and Sir Brastias who
hurried back to Arthur with the message
In a short time King Bors and King Ban arrived with ten thousand
of their soldiers and as Arthur had ten thousand they felt
certain of victory They went into Wales a country which
Arthurs followers knew well and waited confidently for the
enemy
The eleven kings collected a great host of sixty thousand men
fifty thousand on horseback and ten thousand on foot They
marched towards the place where Arthur was and set up their camp
near a wood about a mile distant When Merlin knew this he said
to Arthur and the two kings
Illustration King Bors and King Ban
This is my advice Set upon your enemies at midnight when they
are unprepared and then you will have the advantage
So Arthur and the two royal brothers and the twenty thousand
soldiers crept up to where the eleven kings and their men lay
They took a road circling round the wood Moving with great
caution they drew nearer and nearer until they could see first
the camp fires in a circle around the white tents and then
against the flashing flames the dark figures of the men who were
keeping guard Sometimes they were afraid that the noise they
