A feature in the book is the series of samplers designed to show not
only what are the available stitches but the groups into which they
naturally gather themselves as well as the use to which they may be
put and the back of the sampler is given too the reader has only to
turn the page to see the other side of the stitchingwhich to a
needlewoman is often the more helpful Lest that should not be enough
the stitches are described in the text and a marginal note shows at a
glance where the description is given This should be read needle and
thread in handor skipped Samplers and other examples of needlework
are uniformly on a scale large enough to show the stitch quite plainly
The examples of old work illustrate always in the first place some
point of workmanship still they are chosen with some view to their
artistic interest
In other respects Art is not overlooked but it is Art in harness
Design is discussed with reference to stitch and stuff and stitch and
stuff with reference to their use in ornament It has been endeavoured
also to show the effect needlework has had upon pattern and the ways in
which design is affected by the circumstance that it is to be
embroidered
The joint authorship of the work needs perhaps a word of explanation
This is not just a mans book on a womans subject The scheme of it is
mine and I have written it but with the cooperation throughout of
Miss Mary Buckle Our classification of the stitches is the result of
many a conference between us The description of the way the stitches
are worked and so forth is my rendering of her description
supplemented by practical demonstration with the needle She has primed
me with technical information and been always at hand to keep me from
technical error With reference to design and art I speak for myself
My thanks are due to the authorities at South Kensington for allowing us
to handle the treasures of the national collection and to photograph
them for illustration to Mrs Walter Crane Miss Mabel Keighley and
Miss C P Shrewsbury for permission to reproduce their handiwork to
Miss Argles Mrs Buxton Morrish Colonel Green RE and Messrs
Morris and Co for the loan of work belonging to them and to Miss
Chart for working the crossstitch sampler
I must also acknowledge the part my daughter has had in the production
of this book without her constant help it could never have been
written

ART IN NEEDLEWORK
EMBROIDERY AND STITCHING
Embroidery begins with the needle and the needle thorn fishbone or
whatever it may have been came into use so soon as ever savages had the
wit to sew skins and things together to keep themselves warmmodesty
we may take it was an afterthoughtand if the stitches made any sort
of pattern as coarse stitching naturally would that was embroidery
The term is often vaguely used to denote all kinds of ornamental
needlework and some with which the needle has nothing to do That is
misleading though it is true that embroidery does touch on the one
side tapestry which may be described as a kind of embroidery with
the shuttle and on the other lace which is needlework pure and
simple construction in the air as the Italian name has it
The term is used in common parlance to express any kind of superficial
or superfluous ornamentation A poet is said to embroider the truth
But such metaphorical use of the word hints at the real nature of the
workembellishment enrichment added If added there must first of
all be something it is added tothe material that is to say on
which the needlework is done In weaving even tapestry weaving the
pattern is got by the interthreading of warp and weft In lace too it
is got out of the threads which make the stuff In embroidery it is got
by threads worked on a fabric first of all woven on the loom or it
might be netted
There is inevitably a certain amount of overlapping of the crafts For
instance take a form of embroidery common in all countries Eastern
Hungarian or nearer home in which certain of the weft threads of the
linen are drawn out and the needlework is executed upon the warp
threads thus revealed This is strictly speaking a sort of tapestry
with the needle just as it was explained tapestry itself may be
described as a sort of embroidery with the shuttle That will be clearly
seen by reference to Illustration 1 which shows a fragment of ancient
tapestry found in a Coptic tomb in Upper Egypt In the lower portion of
it the pattern appears light on dark As a matter of fact it was
wrought in white and red upon a linen warp but as it happened only
the white threads were of linen like the warp the red were woollen
and in the course of fifteen hundred years or so much of this red wool
has perished leaving the white pattern intact on the warp the
threads of which are laid bare in the upper part of the illustration
Illustration 1 TAPESTRY SHOWING WARP
It is on just such upright lines of warp that all tapestry properly so
called is workedwhether with the shuttle or with the needle makes no
matterand there is good reason therefore for the name of tapestry
stitch to describe needlework upon the warp threads only of a material
usually linen from which some of the weft threads have been
withdrawn
The only difference between true tapestry and drawn work an example of
which is here given is that the one is done on a warp that has not
before been woven upon and the other on a warp from which the weft
threads have been drawn The distinction therefore between tapestry
and embroidery is that worked on a warp as in Illustration 1 it is
tapestry worked on a mesh as in Illustration 3 it is embroidery
Illustration 2 DRAWN WORK
With regard again to lace That is itself a web independent of any
groundwork or foundation to support it But it is possible to work it
over a silken or other surface and there is a kind of embroidery
which only floats on the surface of the material without penetrating it
A fragment of last century silk given in Illustration 35 shows plainly
what is meant
Illustration 3 STITCHING ON A SQUARE MESH
Embroidery is enrichment by means of the needle To embroider is to work
on something a groundwork is presupposed And we usually understand
by embroidery needlework in thread it may be wool cotton linen
silk gold no matter what upon a textile material no matter what In
short it is the decoration of a material woven in thread by means still
of thread It is thus the consistent way of ornamenting stuffmost
consistent of all when one kind of thread is employed throughout as in
the case of linen upon linen silk upon silk The enrichment may
however rightly be and oftenest is perhaps in a material nobler than
the stuff enriched in silk upon linen in wool upon cotton in gold
upon velvet The advisability of working upon a precious stuff in thread
less precious is open to question It does not seem to have been
satisfactorily done but if it were only the background that was worked
and the pattern were so schemed as almost to cover it so that in fact
very little of the more beautiful texture was sacrificed and you had
still a sumptuous pattern on a less attractive backgroundwhy not But
then it would be because you wanted that less precious texture there
The excuse of economy would scarcely hold good
In the case of a material in itself unsightly the one course is to
cover it entirely with stitching as did the Persian and other
untireable people of the East But not they only The famous Syon cope
is so covered Much of the work so done allover work that is to say
competes in effect with tapestry or other weaving and its purpose was
similar it is a sort of amateur way of working your own stuff But in
character it is no more nearly related to the work of the loom than
other needleworkit is still work on stuff For allover embroidery
one chooses naturally a coarse canvas ground to work on but it more
often happens that one chooses canvas because one means to cover it
than that one works all over a ground because it is unpresentable
Embroidery is merely an affair of stitching and the first thing needful
alike to the worker in it and the designer for it is a thorough
acquaintance with the stitches not of course with every modification
of a modification of a stitch which individual ingenuity may have
devisedit would need the space of an encyclopdia to chronicle them
allbut with the broadly marked varieties of stitch which have been
employed to best purpose in ornament
They are derived naturally from the stitches first used for quite
practical and prosaic purposesbuttonhole stitch for example to keep
the edges of the stuff from fraying herringbone to strengthen and
disguise a seam darning to make good a worn surface and so on
The difficulty of discussing them is greatly increased by the haphazard
way in which they are commonly named A stitch is called Greek Spanish
Mexican or what not according to the country whence came the work in
which some one first found it Each names it after his or her individual
discovery or calls it perhaps vaguely Oriental and so we have any
number of names for the same stitch names which to different people
stand often for quite different stitches

every conceivable combination of threadstrokes or for each slightest

far to go in the study of the authorities to discover that though they
may concur in using certain highsounding Latin terms they are not of
the same mind as to their meaning In one thing they all agree foreign
