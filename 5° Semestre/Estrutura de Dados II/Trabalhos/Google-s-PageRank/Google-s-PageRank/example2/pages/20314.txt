MYRAS DREADFUL CHILDREN
Miss Hetty Maise having spent the night in fitful spells of slumber at
last awakened by the beams of sunlight sat up in bed with a start
quite unrefreshed and possessed of an uncomfortable feeling that
something unpleasant was about to happen A venturesome sunbeam casting
its light upon a picture on the heavy walnut dresser seemed to recall
the cause of her sleepless night and present uneasy state of mind
Drawing her lips tightly together she frowned severely at the
inquisitive intruder
Those children she thought Myras dreadful children If the
minister himself hadnt insisted that it was my plain duty to take them
I shouldnt have done it It seems almost a sin to take in two children
who have been circus performers
Miss Hetty was up by this time for she hated to be idle In fact the
ministers son had once remarked that she was accustomed to stir her
cake batter while she was reading her Bible but then the ministers son
was inclined to be irreverent at times
But even he would have felt sorry for Miss Hetty this morning To adopt
two children when you know nothing whatever about their care was by no
means a pleasant prospect Besides these children were the son and
daughter of the outcast of the family an only sister halfforgotten
though only two months deceased The thing itself was pathetic yet it
seemed an imposition above all to adopt two children who had traveled
all their young lives with a circus was at least to Miss Hettys mind
almost scandalous
Often during the morning she absently folded her hand and in
unaccustomed idleness gazed as if dazed down the quiet village street
as if expecting help from that source Once having aroused herself she
had gone to an old trunk her deceased mothers and drew out two faded
pictures tied with an old ribbon and folded over a lock of yellow hair
The first picture the face of a girl that smiled up at her so sweetly
and trustingly caused unbidden tears to well up in her eyes just as it
had always affected her mother The second picture was regarded with
more interest though with less affection Here was the same loved face
but beside it the merry dark face of the actor husband for whom she had
left her home and in her arms their first baby brandedas Miss Hetty
thoughtwith the heathenish name of Periwinkle A letter had
accompanied this photograph but it had never been answered Several
years later another letter had been received telling of the death of
her husband and of the illness of Periwinkles two year old sister
Pearl
Though Myra had died but two months before and if perhaps then her
younger sister had felt any pang of pity for the orphaned children it
did not enter her thoughts this morning She plumped up the pillows on
the prim horsehair sofa painfully recalling the pillow fight she had
once seen between her cousins children Children were a nuisance and
these twoMyras dreadful boy and girlwere bound to be more than
that
Her sense of indignation reaching a higher pitch every minute she
spitefully slammed the front door and left the house just as the clock
struck eleven Her heels clicked on the sidewalk sharply in full
sympathy with her state of mind as she walked down the street of the
village And then as she might have expected she met the one person
whom she least of all desired to meet An icy stare on her part a stiff
formal bow from the man passingthat was all but she knew that in that
brief interval he had had ample opportunity to observe that she was
worried and cross and looked every day of her twentynine lonely years
and of course it could not but give him much satisfaction This
disturbing thought crowded out the remembrance of the unloved unwelcome
niece and nephew until a sharp curve in the road brought into view the
smoke begrimed depot and drawn up before it the train which had just
come to a puffing throbbing standstill like a wild horse unwilling to
pause in its mad race
Several of Miss Hettys acquaintances gathered on the station platform
were not accorded the usual recognition for her eyes were fixed
intently on the childish pair alighting from the train The one a tall
slender lad of about thirteen with curls of golden yellow hair
clustering over a broad forehead a mouth whose sensitive delicately
modeled lips together with the shadowy depths of deep grey eyes
indicated even in one so young the temperament of a dreamer first
engaged her attention But little Pearl Hair black as night when only
one star is shining and eyes like the double image of that star a
figure as tiny as the dream of a fairy that was Pearl
It was not her childish charm however that made Miss Hetty gasp It was
the enormous bow half covering her head and the butterfly comb that
caught back her curls The ribbon seemed larger than the silk frock
buoyant with many skirts and quite abbreviated while the little
highheeled shoes seemed designed for anything rather than wear
For a time the children stood quite alone on the platform Their first
appearance had held Miss Hetty spellbound at her position near the door
She felt rather than heard a suppressed chuckle run through the small
crowd Then suddenly her gaze met a pair of compelling brown eyes not
cold and scrutinizing as they had been when their owner had passed her a
short time before but sympathetic and friendly She blushed furiously
and quickly walking toward the forlorn pair extended to each a cold
hand of welcome
Come Periwinkle come Pearl she said not ungently I am your Aunty
Hetty and have come to take you home And holding her head high and her
eyes straight ahead she lead the strange pair past the tall gentlemen
on the platform
Do you know Aunt Hetty I thought it was you said the boy eagerly as
they left the station You look a little like our mother did She told
us lots about you and so did the Fat Woman
The fat woman exclaimed Miss Hetty somewhat in surprise Who is
she
She looked after us replied Pearl in a voice so sweet that in spite
of her aversion to her duty Miss Hettys heart began to warm to her
unwelcome charges Even while mother was living she cared for us and
she told us all we know She got me all my clothes She was so jolly and
nice and so was Mr Barleydon and I didnt want to leave the circus I
didnt but Periwinkle did
Why did Periwinkle want to leave asked Miss Hetty now becoming much
interested although she did purse up her lips when she spoke the
obnoxious name Periwinkle answered for himself I didnt like the
trapezes nor the everlasting traveling I wanted to be in a home like
mother told us about and go to school And besides that I didnt want
Pearl to be like the spangled circus ladies even if some of them were
lovely and the Fat Woman perfectly grand so was one of the clowns You
cant imagine Aunt Hetty what a noble charitable fellow Jerry was I
disliked to leave them But how I hated the snakecharmer you cant
imagine Auntie
Aunt Hetty shivered at the mere mention of a snakecharmer She could
easily sympathize with Periwinkle in his aversion for her
You use pretty big words for a boy Periwinkle was however all that
she said
Yes the Fat Woman said she couldnt account for them but she taught
us and she is a very brilliant woman Little Pearl can read splendid
You cant imagine Aunt Hetty
You said that the Fat Woman told you about me hinted Miss Hetty
forgetting that she didnt wish to know anything about these worldly
people
O yes replied Pearl also desirous of furnishing her aunt with some
more information concerning her friend the Fat Woman She said as you
would be different from the ladies we were used to but youd be our
relation and mean all for our good and we was to put up with you as
youd put up with us and to respect you and love you like we did her
But you wont mind just at first will you if we cant love you quite
so much as her cause the Fat Woman was very dear to me and
Periwinkle
A sudden something gushed up in the heart of Miss Maise the something
that makes the Fat Woman and the clown and all of us kin but it died
down as quickly and she only said
I shall expect you to be good children and obey me that is all
Not love you asked her young nephew in surprise
The hard look faded again from Aunt Hettys face as she yielding to such
an irresistible entreaty hesitatingly replied
Yesyes a little if you can
CHAPTER II
PIGS CABBAGES ANDMR ROBERT GREY
The day following the arrival of Pearl and Periwinkle at their Aunt
Hettys home was Sunday But the children were not permitted to attend
the church service since the time had been too short to procure suitable
clothing for Pearl Miss Maise feeling that she would be setting a poor
example in remaining at home herself determined at least to attempt the
instruction of the children in their Sundayschool lesson Immediately
then after the breakfast dishes were washed she called them into the
living room
Miss Hetty did not know just how to begin The children sat quietly
regarding her with wideopen eyes and under their questioning gaze she
felt rather uneasy A clothcovered catechism was lying on the table and
this she finally took up Glancing at the first page opened she abruptly
asked her niece
Are you a Christian
Pearl gazed at her inquiringly but gave no answer Miss Hetty was
prepared for the worst now
Do you believe in God she continued
Yes answered the child in a surprised tone
Who is He was the next question asked
Pearl pointed a little forefinger upward Up there she said in that
awed tone in which little children speak of God no matter how limited
their knowledge concerning Him And all of Miss Hettys questions
convinced her that Pearls religion was limited to the knowledge that
God lives up there
Periwinkle admitted that he knew little more except that their mother
had told them that God always sees them
And dont you know any Scripture passages nor Bible stories nor your
Catechism and dont you know that God punishes children who do not love
His Word asked their aunt in much surprise
But we never heard him speak a word cried Pearl in reply
Miss Hetty gazed at the child in eloquent silence Then she arose
unlocked the bookcase and selected two books
Learn the first two pages by the time I come back she said Ill
leave you for half an hour I know no other way of helping you
There was silence for five minutes after their aunt with an indignant
swish of skirts had left the room Pearl was the first to break the
silence
Do you think this is much fun Peri she inquired looking up with a
puzzled frown
No I dont I dont understand it The Fat Woman never gave us a
lesson unless she explained it first
Lets not study any more then Its dreadfully hot in here and the air
smells awful nice comin through the window Just like tulips and roses
and several brands of perfume jumbled together Say Periwinkle if you
opened that window ever so little I could just fly right out to that
yellow butterfly thats wiping his feet on Aunt Hettys flowers
Pearls wish was always law to her adoring brother He set her free and
as soon as he saw her flying away he daringly raised the window still
higher and jumped out quietly himself
Hand in hand they skipped down the street as noiselessly as snowbirds in
the snowdrift and as gracefully as two windblown leaves Many people
were walking along the street all dressed in their best clothes and all
going in one direction Suddenly Periwinkle clutched his sisters hand
Look Pearl he exclaimed excitedly theres that tall man with the
nice brown eyes and the tan shoes who looked at Aunt Hetty so funny at
the station yesterday Should we speak to him
It would be nice of us Pearl replied and always accustomed to act on
the impulse she called Howdy do Mister Why is everybody going this
way this morning
The man thus addressed stopped and looking down on them with one of
those smiles of comradeship that won their hearts at once replied
Why hello Its Sunday you know and we are all going to church
Dont you want to come along
Oh Aunt Hetty wouldntshe dont like my clothes you know
I think theyre real pretty replied their newfound friend smiling a
little because of their answer Silk arent they
Yes trimmed with satin and snowflake chiffon I guess well go with
you Mister
Good There was a ring in his voice that the children could not
understand To walk to church hand in hand with the niece and nephew of
Hetty Maise would be a novel experience not unattended with some
humorthat appealed to him to win their love would be the victory he
most desired
Wont you tell me your names please he whispered as they entered the
church
Periwinkle and Pearl Toddles relatives of Miss Hetty Maise was the
whispered reply
Having introduced himself as Robert Grey their new acquaintance led
them down the broad aisle of the church As soon as the organ began to
sound its sonorous tones Pearl forgot her strange surroundings entirely
and sat between her brother and Mr Grey as if in a trance Not until
the sermon was well under way did she move and then only to lean
against Periwinkle and whisper Isnt this fun Peri Not fun
exactly he whispered in reply but awfully nice Hush Pearl and if
you get tired just practice on your multiplication table
It was not until after the doxology had been sung and they had come out
into the open air that the children spoke again
Wasnt it wonderful asked Periwinkle dreamily Do you know what I
thought of Mr Grey when the man was speaking He said we should do
good to all people How I wish Id have heard him say that before I hit
that boy that sneaked around the tent at Higginsport That man makes you
feel like you want to be good doesnt he
Will you bring us again asked Pearl with a wistful look on her
anxious face I like music even better than riding around the ring
Your aunt Miss Maisewill bring you next Sunday was the only
promise that Mr Grey could hold out for them
We wish you could go with us too Thank you for taking us they called
as they left him
The hands of the clock on the schoolhouse were pointing to twelve when
Pearl and Periwinkle crawled quietly into the parlor through the still
open window Their books were on the floor where they had dropped them
but before they could have picked them up had they so desired Miss
Hetty came in Came in is expressing it very mildly Even Periwinkle
with his extensive vocabulary could not think of an adequate word to
describe the manner of her entrance
You have been disobedient Dont tell me you havent Youve been
playing on the street Dont tell me
The children however did not attempt to interrupt her or defend
themselves until she had finished her scolding Then her nephew let his
thunderbolt fall
Weve been to church with Mr Robert Grey
To churchwithMr Grey gasped Miss Maise sinking into the nearest
chair and staring at the two young culprits as if she thought that the
heat had affected their minds To churchwithRobert Grey
Yes Aunty Hetty Mr Robert Grey with the brown eyes I should think
if anybody was named Grey their eyes ought to be grey
Periwinkle Toddles Did Mr Grey have the nerve to come to my house and
steal you away to be made a laughing stock of in church
The boy flushed but tried to be courteous in his answer
I didnt see anybody laugh at us Aunt Hetty And Mr Grey didnt steal
us away We got tired of sitting here and so we ran out in the street
and he saw us and took us with him Some children sang and a man talked
and we had a dandy time Im sorry that I disobeyed you but Im glad I
went and I dont know whether Im gladder or sorrier So I dont much
care what you do to me
You will be punished severely replied their aunt for running away
and going to church with that man
Why what is wrong with him queried the niece remembering Mr Greys
wonderful smile and how nicely he had treated them
Miss Hetty was silent for a moment She was uncertain just which was the
best way to answer this question Finally she said Pearl Periwinkle
There is something I must tell you something that you must find out
before you begin school the week after next It may be hard for you to
understand this but you must know it so that you will not make any
mistakes again You know there are only two families in this village
two families that have any influence I mean They are the Maises and
the Greys and their relatives They used to be good friends in fact
such good friends that two of them promised to become even more to one
another Three years ago a quarrel began My father had a very fine pig
a Poland China very fatI remember One night it strayed into neighbor
Greys cabbage patch and being a pig did much damage Mr Grey came to
father who promised to keep Glennythe pigat home That same night it
got out again and Mr Grey who was rather hot tempered sicked his dog
on it The big fellow killed our finest pig Father went to law about
it but died before it came to court and the lawsuit was dropped But
the quarrel kept on just the same The Greys clung together and so did
the Maises Every one else in the village sided with one or the other I
thought Id better tell you this before you started to school The
Maises and Greys pass each other without speaking now
Why I think thats silly said Peri energetically and Mr Grey dont
look like a fellow to get sore over a pig
He did his best to avoid getting mixed up in the trouble admitted
Miss Maise but it was his fathers dog that killed the pig and he
just couldnt help himself perhaps Everyone got mixed up in it somehow
and I dont believe any power under the sun can make the Maises and the
Greys friends again But if you think Ive forgotten how disobedient
youve been you are much mistaken
Its a shame Periwinkle to tie a big boy like you to a chair but I
see I cant trust you With these words she drew a ball of twine from
her pocket and to his great shame began securing him Then she fastened
little Pearl in a like manner
Ill bring you bread and milk for your dinner she said and perhaps
you wont be so anxious to run away the next time
But just the same said Pearl when her aunt had left as if she at
least had found much consolation in the thought we went to a good
place
Her brother however did not reply he was thinking of a Poland China pig
in a cabbage patch and comparing its loss with that of Mr Greys
priceless friendship
CHAPTER III
AT THE SHRINE OF JOE SMITH
The occasion of the first meeting with the minister was a memorable one
for Pearl and Periwinkle As good as Clown Jerry was Pearls rather
startling statement while Periwinkle assured Aunt Hetty that the
preacher was even more brilliant than the Fat Woman
It so happened that this meeting took place that very Sunday afternoon
when the two children were doing penance for their mornings escapade
The minister had called for the special purpose of meeting Miss Hettys
new charges very much to that good ladys dismay She afterward
declared it to be one of the tricks of fate that the minister should
have called at that particular time especially since her niece still
wore that horrid blue dress of which she so much disapproved But the
minister did not seem to notice neither the dress nor the fastenings
which confined the children He seemed rather to be impressed by Pearls
wonderfully expressive face and the startling sweetness of her voice
while Periwinkles precociousness and quaint grownup ways attracted
him very much
Let the children come to see me soon Miss Hetty he urged and I may
be able to give them some instruction along the lines in which you say
they lack so much Joe could help them in their lessons too And then
turning to Pearl and Periwinkle he asked How would you like to come
to the parsonage and go over your lessons with my son
Would he play with us queried Pearl
With a hearty laugh the minister replied Im almost afraid he would
He is still a boy even though he is nineteen and goes to college I am
sure that he still knows how to play Hes the only boy I haveall I
haveand I suppose Ive spoiled him
When shall I send the children Rev Smith asked Miss Maise
Tomorrow or the next day was the prompt reply This is midAugust
We cant begin too soon
Tuesday afternoon the children wended their way to the parsonage Pearl
was clad in a starched gingham dress uncomfortably high about the neck
and with sleeves of an unaccustomed length The minister himself met
them at the door and ushered them into a room that from all appearances
was meant to be used as a comfortable and cozy living roomeven though
there were some evidences of disorder which they knew their aunt would
not have approved of
Amuse yourselves for a minute while I try to find Joe It is rather
difficult to keep track of him said the minister as he left them
alone
When a few minutes later the minister followed by his son was about
to enter the room he stopped and grasping his sons arm warningly
they both unperceived watched the two children
Left to their own resources the children had not remained inactive
Their curious eyes taking in all the strange surroundings they saw many
things that interested them One of the pictures on the east wall
particularly impressed them It portrayed the figure of a man his face
lighted up with a wonderfully tender expression while in his arms and
round about him were small children alone or with their mothers The
afternoon sun shining through the open window seemed to shed a radiant
halo over the whole group and to make the picture stand out in bold
relief Standing before the picture in silent wonder they had not
noticed the approach of the minister and his son The minister quietly
withdrew and when the children turned as if by common impulse they saw
only a young man whose ingratiating smile at once opened a way to their
hearts
Their previous experience in coming in contact with people enabled them
to become acquainted with the ministers son and to feel themselves the
very best of friends in less time than it ordinarily takes children to
overcome their natural timidity in the presence of strangers Nor was it
any wonder that a close friendship was formed so quickly for Joseph
Smith was that type of grown up boy whom all children feel instinctively
to be their friend
After the first greetings and establishment of this friendship Pearl
turned with childlike determination to the matter uppermost in her
curious mind
What is the name of that picture she asked pointing at the one which
had attracted their attention
That is Christ Blessing the Children replied Joe and then he
hesitated His father had asked him to help the children with their
arithmetic he had not specified that he turn missionary as well as
teacher Work of that kind was not exactly in his line Like so many
lads of his age he seldom spoke on religious topics although his faith
was a vital factor in his life But catching sight of the enraptured
face of little Pearl he felt certain facts flashing through his mind
something about Christs love for little ones and that we should not
offend one of them
So he bravely began to tell the sweet story though somewhat rapidly and
not any too clearly
Jesus Christ the only Son of God whom God loved very much lived on
earth and walked with His disciples His disciples were the men who
followed Him and heard His teachings and tried to be like Him by doing
good and helping others The mothers who lived where Jesus was preaching
heard of His kindness They had heard also how He healed some of their
sick friends So they brought their children to Him so that He might
bless them Now when the disciples saw the women with the little
children they told them to go back to their homes They said that Christ
was too busy to bother with children But Jesus did not want them to do
this and he told his disciples Suffer the little children to come unto
me and forbid them not for of such is the Kingdom of God He loved
little children and He also wanted them in His kingdom He then took
them in His arms and blessed them just as you see in this picture
A solemn stillness followed while the two turned again to view the
lovely painting Finally Periwinkle broke the silence
He must have been very good to take such an interest in the little
children Thereupon all thought of the arithmetic lesson vanished and
Joe briefly told the whole beautiful story from the night of the
angels song until Jesus Christ again returned to His throne in heaven
When Joe had finished his recital Periwinkle looked up with sparkling
eyes
Oh how glad I am to know that How I wish the Fat Woman could have
heard it Shed been so interested I think she always thought herself
better than the rest of the circus people
A certain short prayer with somewhat similar meaning occurred to the
ministers son but he only smiled at the pharisaical egotism of the Fat
Woman After all she had trained the children morally if not
religiously and this made the teaching of Christian truths far less
difficult Children reared in love are almost always ready to accept the
story of the Supreme Love
She never said anything about faith continued Periwinkle in his
thoughtful way But she told us Do unto others as you would have them
do unto you Maybe he ventured with some hesitancy that was her
faith Do you suppose it would be just as good Joe
Joe was somewhat surprised that his young pupil had thus unconsciously
stumbled upon a disputed point that has led many minds astray but he
answered firmly and with conviction
No Peri the Fat Woman could not keep the law of love perfectly Do
you think she did he challenged suddenly
No cried Pearl who had been listening intently Once or twice she
slapped us when we hadnt done a thing and sometimes she got very
spiteful at Mr Barleydon and she used to tell mother that the
tightrope walker made her sick Thats not doing unto others as we wish
them to do unto us But the loyal youngster hastened to defend her
friend the tightrope walker was enough to make anybody sick and then
I guess the Fat Woman never heard about Jesus saying Love your
enemies
Perhaps she did know it replied Joe but she couldnt have kept the
rule perfectly anyway Nobody can Pearl even those who know Gods law
best although they must always try very hard God showed His great love
for us by sending Jesus Christ to keep the law for us He could not do
wrong or fail to keep the law And now if we believe in Him and come to
Him as children come to their father for help He will count it the same
as if our lives were as good and perfect as His ownBut Im afraid
that I cant make it clear to you and it will be pretty hard to
understand he added
Joe said Periwinkle gravely his hands in his pockets and his eyes on
his young friends face did you ever hear anything you didnt just
exactly want to understand something thats too nice to get right down
on a footing with yourself Once I was reading one of Mr Barleydons
books of poetry that made you feel like a breeze was carrying you right
up to the gates of heaven Mr Barleydon looked at me in surprise then
looked at the book and asked kind of funny Do you understand it boy
No sir I told him but somehow I feel it better for not being able
to understand it quite And thats how I feel about some of the things
you told us Do you suppose thats all right
I think Peri said Joe soberly that is the real understanding
Say you know what a fellows driving at cried Periwinkle with
delight Jerry the clown was sympathetic like that I think that
Jerry next to you and your dad is the most Christian person I know
Aunt Hetty aint one though he finished rather bluntly
Why Peri protested the ministers son your Aunt Hetty is one of the
best workers in the church She belongs Joe smiled as he hesitated
to our Ladies Aid the Adult Bible Class the Ladies Missionary
Society and if I am not mistaken also to a Temperance Union an
Anticigarette Club and a host of others
But she doesnt love her enemies was Periwinkles reply
Joe smiled to see how deep an impression this injunction made on both
children
And all the Greys are her enemies continued Periwinkle especially
Mr Robert Grey Now I think he is a fine man
He is was the warm rejoinder
I guess they were in love once And thenjust because of a pigI
think its dreadful Joe
The boy had touched on a subject that was a matter of concern with his
teacher and one to which he had given much thought
Peri he cried if I had the chance my father has every Sunday I
would tell them that they are showing themselves to be mighty poor
Christians But then dad knows best of course Hes had years of
experience to help him Only I dont see how he stands it For three
years he has been trying to bring the Maises and the Greys together and
he is not discouraged though I cant see any results Peri Joe
stopped suddenly
What Joe
Youll be starting to school soon There will be Greys and Maises
there I know that if I speak to them about itand I willthe Greys
wont pitch into you unless you start something
I wont do it Id just as lief fight a Maise as a Grey any day I
aintb i g o t e d
A sudden smile lit up the features of Joe Smith It shone from his eyes
parted his lips lurked in the dimple in his chin and then slowly died
away His eyes held it the longest
That smile had won many a friend for the lad It made him a favorite at
college in the village and in the church with the Greys and the Maises
alike But never had it made a greater conquest than now Every child
and every grownup whose heart is young is a heroworshiper In the
heart of Periwinkle a new fire was kindled a new shrine built Then and
there he decided that his every deed should be worthy of his Ideal
You dont want me to fight at all he questioned after a moment of
silent adoration And I wont unless they pitch into Pearl Why here
comes your father and I guess its most suppertime
Oh laughed the minister entering the room Miss Hettys table would
