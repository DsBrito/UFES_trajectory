How can they put in black and white
What little children think at night
When lights are out and prayers are said
And you are all tucked up in bed
Such funny dreams go dancing through
Your head of things nobody knew
Or saw or ever half believes
Theyre all inside these singing leaves
And little children laugh and go
AringaroundarosyO
And birds sing gayyoud almost think
You listened to a bobolink
Look at the pictures one by one
The rhymes are only half the fun
It laughs and bubbles like a brook
My pretty jolly jinglebook
MR TONGUE
A little red man in a little red house
With gates of ivory
He might stay there as still as a mouse
And nobody could see
But talk he will and laugh he will
At everything you do
And come to the door and peep until
I know his namedont you
KISSES
Heres a kiss for every year
And here is one to grow on
Father says and mother says
And auntie says and so on
Heres a pat and theres a pat
If growing comes of kisses
I know how one girl found a way
To grow as big as this is
THE TRIALS OF TRAVEL
Boohoo boohoo boohoo boohoo
My mother says I cant take Sue
And Grace and Maud and Clarabel
And Ruth and Beth and sweet Estelle
Unless I pack them with our things
Oh dear oh dear my heart it wrings
To put them in that hot dark place
With paper wrapped around each face
Im sure they all would suffocate
Or meet some other dreadful fate
Id gladly take them on my arm
And keep them safe from every harm
But mother says that that wont do
She draws the line at more than two
Id like to know what she would say
To sending me packed in a tray

THE QUARREL
The Wooden Dog and the China Cat
Face to face in the dollhouse sat
And they picked a quarrel that grew and grew
Because they had nothing else to do
Said the dog I really would like to hear
Why you never stir nor frisk nor purr
But sit like a mummy there
Up spoke in a temper the china puss
Glad of an opening for a fuss
Dear Mr Puppy I cant recall
That I ever heard you bark at all
Your bark is a wooden bark tis true
But as to that said the China Cat
My mew is a china mew
So they bristled and quarreled more and more
Till the baby came creeping across the floor
He took the cat by his whiskers frail
He grasped the dog by his wooden tail
And banged them togetherand after that
Left them a wiser Wooden Dog
And a sadder China Cat
Now children just between you and me
Dont you think in the future they will agree

MY PLAYMATES
When Willie comes to visit me
We play menagerie
He says Pretend that youre a lamb
And Ill a lion be
Then he begins to growl and roar
And make a dreadful noise
I dont mind much when he goes home
Its hard to play with boys
When Julia comes to visit me
I am her waiting maid
While shes a lady grand and stern
Of her Im most afraid
She sends me for my mothers hat
Then takes her nicest skirt
And trails it all around the house
Until its full of dirt
When Alice comes to play with me
She asks What shall we play
I answer Anything you like
She coaxes Do please say
Sometimes its dolls sometimes its games
No matter what it be
I have the very nicest time
When Alice plays with me
REBECCA DEMING MOORE
A PUZZLING THING
Eight of us went to a party
The nicest ever given
There was apple fluff and frosted stuff
And cake and candy and fruit enough
But seats for only seven
Eight of us hurried homeward
After the happy treat
With run and bound yet there were found
Only the tracks on the dusty ground
Of seven pairs of feet
Eight of us got back safely
And seven told with glee
Of all wed done and the feast and the fun
But one of us was a silent one
Now which can that one be
NANCY BYRD TURNER
HER NAME
Im losted  Could you find me please
Poor little frightened baby
The wind had tossed her golden fleece
The stones had scratched her dimpled knees
I stooped and lifted her with ease
And softly whispered Maybe
Tell me your name my little maid
I cant find you without it
My name is Shinyeyes she said
Yes but your last  She shook her head
Up to my house they never said
A single fing about it
But Dear I said what is your name
Why dint you hear me told you
Dust Shinyeyes  A bright thought came
Yes when youre good but when they blame
You little oneits not the same
When mother has to scold you
My mother never scolds she moans
A little blush ensuing
Cept when Ive been afrowing stones
And then she says the culprit owns

THE GAME OF GOINGTOBED
Says father when the lamps are lit
Now just five minutes you may sit
Downstairs and then away you go
To play a little game I know
He gives a kiss and pulls a curl
Lets play you were my little girl
And play you jump up on my back
And play we run  And clackityclack
We both go laughing up the stair
If I should fuss hed say No fair
And then he says Night Sleepyhead
Its fun the game of GoingtoBed

THE BALL
Close cuddled in my own two hands
My big round ball with yellow bands
Theyve filled my playroom up with toys
Dolls horses things to make a noise
Engines that clatter on a track
And tipcarts that let down the back
Arks just like Noahs with two and two
Of every animal he knew
Whole rows of houses built of blocks
A mouse that squeaks a doll that talks
But when the Sleepy Man comes by
And Im too tired to want to try
To think of anything at all
Heres my old dear old rubber ball
Close cuddled in my own two hands
My big round ball with yellow bands

A VOYAGE
She rowed way out on the Daisy Sea
with a reallytruly oar
Out of a reallytruly boat and what
could you ask for more
Her sea and her boat were makebelieve
but the daisy waves dashed high
And twas pleasant to know if the boat
went down that her frock would still be dry
She rowed way out on the Daisy Sea with
a reallytruly oar
Past the perilous garden gate where the
fierce white breakers roar
Past the rocks where the mermaids sing as
they comb their golden hair
Past an iceberg grim and tall and a great
white polar bear
She rowed way out on the Daisy Sea with
a reallytruly oar
Till she came to an island castle where she
brought her boat ashore
She entered the castle boldly andwonderful
sight to see
She had rowed straight home to the diningroom
and the table spread for tea
HANNAH G FERNALD
APPLETREE INN
It stands by the roadside coolshuttered and high
With cordial welcome for all who pass by
And heres how you enteryou make a quick dash
And scale the steep stair with a bound in a flash
You cross the clean threshold and find you a chair
Theres room for all comers and plenty to spare
You can rock you can rest happy lodging you win
Who stop for an hour at Appletree Inn
The walls and the roof and the ceiling are green
With rifts of light blue that are painted between
The seats are upholstered in brown and dark gray
And yet for it all not a penny to pay
Then when you are hungry the table is spread
With fare that is dainty delicious and red
Oh hurry and come if you never have been
A guest in your travels at Appletree Inn

AN OUTDOOR GIRL
The wind and the water and a merry little girl
Her yellow hair ablowing and her curls all out of curl
Her lips as red as cherries and her cheeks like any rose
And she laughs to see the little waves come curling round her toes
The breezes ablowing and the blue sky overhead
A laughing little maidenand this is what she said
Oh whats the use of houses  I think it is a sin
To take a lot of boards and bricks and shut the outdoors in

THE BEDTIME STORYBOOK
Theres something very very queer
About a storybook
No matter whats the time of year
Nor where you chance to look
No matter when it is begun
How many pages read
The very best of all the fun
Comes just the time for bed
When mother whispers in your ear
Tis almost eightjust look
Now finish up your chapter dear
And put away your book
The minutes almost seem to race
When it is growing late
The very most exciting place
Is just half after eight
Illustration The Bedtime StoryBook
THE BROWNIES
The little Bad Luck Brownies
They cry and pout and frown
They pucker up a cryingmouth
And pull the corners down
They blot the smile from every face
And hush the happy song
The little Bad Luck Brownies
That make the world go wrong
The little Good Luck Brownies
They sing and laugh and shout
If any cloud of trouble comes
They turn it inside out
To show the silver lining
Thats always always there
The little Good Luck Brownies
That make the world so fair
Illustration Bad Luck and Good Luck Brownies
HER ANSWER
It was an easy question and Margie thought it so
An easy one to answer as any one would know
She smiled and smiled again as it hung upon the wall
In going to school what do you like the very best of all
Then grew a little sober as she began to write
With wrinkles on her forehead and lips a little tight
She wrote her answer carefully with look so grave and wise
She minded all her capitals and dotted all her Is
She crossed her Ts precisely she smiled a little more
At all the pleasant images the pleasant question bore
Of all the merry laughing hours and all the joyous play
The thing I like the best of all in schoola holiday
SIDNEY DAYRE
A TROUBLESOME DAUGHTER
Angelica Sue is the carelessest child
The trouble she makes me is perfectly fearful
I told her this morning but she only smiled
And swung in her hammock and looked just as cheerful
Im sure I should feel I had nothing to do
If some one adopted Angelica Sue
Its always Angelica falls in the dust
Angelicas frock that gets torn on the fences
The other dolls sit as I tell them they must
But when she comes out then the trouble commences
Wherever I go or whatever I do
Shes sure to be with meAngelica Sue
Oh nobody knows how I work for that child
But once when I spoke of her ways to my brother
He said and he looked at us both and he smiled
Angelica Susan takes after her mother
Ive wondered since then if it really can be
Angelica Sue is a little like me

THE RACE
Across the field and down the hill
I ran a race with Cousin Will
And lost my shoe I ran so fast
And that is why I came in last
But Cousin Will would try once more
Across the field down to the shore
This time all would have ended well
Only I stubbed my toe and fell
And then we raced across the yard
And though I ran as swift and hard
As Cousin Will yet some way he
Got to the place ahead of me
Will says to lose is no disgrace
That trying really makes a race
Twas trying he says made the fun
That all we wanted was the run
ALICE TURNER CURTIS
A BIG PLAYFELLOW
Its lots of fun down in the grass
Awatching all the things that pass
You wont come too  I wonder why
Its fun aplaying with the sky
I guess you are too tall to see
If you would come down here with me
And just ungrow a little you
Could see just what you wanted to
Such big cloudships with sails spread out
To catch the breeze thats all about
And big gray birds with soft cloudwings
And wolves and bears and tiger things
Just lying down here in the grass
Ive seen about a million pass
They creep and run and sail and fly
Its fun aplaying with the sky

HAYING TIME
In hayingtime my grandpa says
Im lots of use to him
I take my nice new wheelbarrow
and fill it to the brim
The big team comes out too and
takes the haycocks one by one
And that and my new wheelbarrow
soon get the haying done
F LILEYYOUNG
NOBODY
Nobody boke it  It cracked itself
It was clear way up on the toppest shelf
Iprhaps the kittycat knows
Says poor little Ned
With his ears as red
As the heart of a damask rose
Nobody lost it  I carefully
Put my cap just where it ought to be
No tisnt ahind the door
And it went and hid
Why of course it did
For Ive hunted an hour or more
Nobody tore it  You know things will
Tear if youre sitting just stock stone still
I was just jumping over the fence
Theres some spikes on top
And you have to drop
Before you can half commence
Nobody  Wicked Sir Nobody
Playing such tricks on my children three
If I but set eyes on you
You should find what youve lost
But that to my cost
I never am like to do
Illustration Nobody
MY GARDEN
I have a little garden
All edged with fouroclocks
And some of it is sunflowers
And some is hollyhocks
And all around the border
Ive planted little stones
A lot of round beach pebbles
To keep out Rovers bones
And then as plain as daylight
A sign Keep off the grass
Warns hens and everybody
That here they shouldnt pass
But Rover makes his pantry
Right in that garden patch
And all the hens and chickens
Think thats the place to scratch
ANNA BURNHAM BRYANT
MAMMAS LITTLE HOUSEMAID
I am mammas little housemaid dont you see
They couldnt get along so well if it were not for me
For every Friday morning I take my little broom
And sweep and sweep the pretty rugs that lie in mammas room
And then I sweep the doorsteps off and do not leave a crumb
And wipe the dishes too and oh it is the bestest fun
And then when mamma starts to bake she says that maybe I
Can make all by my very self a cunning little pie
When I am big enough for school I think Ill like to go
But truly I would rather stay at home you know
And help my mamma do the work and bake a little pie
For mamma says all little girls if they would only try
Can help their mammas very much with willing hands and feet
By sweeping rugs and doorsteps and keeping porches neat
So I am mammas housemaid and she pays me with a kiss
And papa when he comes at night says Bless me what is this
How bright and clean the rugs do look  And then I laugh and say
That my little broom and I work for mamma every day
HARRIET CROCKER LEROY
TOYS
Toys have a bedtime too
Oh but its really true
This is what you should do
Just as the sun sinks low
Off to bed make them go
Laid in a tidy row
There let them rest all night
Sleep until morning light
Then wake when day shines bright
ALICE VAN LEER CARRICK
THE BATH
It always has seemed queer to me
When I give Bess a bath
In our big shiny new white tub
She shorter grows by half
But when I take her out again
She hasnt changed at all
If you have doubts of what I say
Just try it with your doll

NAPTIME
Rockabye me  Rockabye me
Im just as tired as I can be
Weve swung and swung as high as the sky
Then slower to let the old cat die
We played we were grasshoppershippityhop
The grasshoppers go and they never stop
