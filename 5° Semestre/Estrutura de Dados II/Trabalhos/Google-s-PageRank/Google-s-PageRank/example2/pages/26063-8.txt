THE MANDARINS FAN
The Nashville American says The book is most attractive and
thoroughly novel in plot and construction The mystery of the curious
fan and its being the key to such wealth and power is decidedly
original and unique Nearly every character in the book seems possible
of accusation It is just the sort of plot in which Hume is at his best
It is a complex tangle full of splendid climaxes Few authors have a
charm equal to that of Mr Humes mystery tales

CHAPTER I
THE CHRISTMAS TREE
Two old ladies sat in the corner of the drawingroom The youngera
colonial cousin of the elderwas listening eagerly to gossip which
dealt with English society in general and Rickwell society in
particular They presumably assisted in the entertainment of the
children already gathered tumultuously round the Christmas tree
provided by Mr Morley but Mrs Parrys budget of scandal was too
interesting to permit the relaxing of Mrs McKails attention
Ah yes said Mrs Parry a hatchetfaced dame with a venomous tongue
and a retentive memory Morleys fond of children although he has none
of his own
But those three pretty little girls said Mrs McKail who was fat
fair and considerably over forty
Triplets replied the other sinking her voice The only case of
triplets I have met with but not his children No Mrs Morley was a
widow with triplets and money Morley married her for the last and had
to take the first as part of the bargain I dont deny but what he does
his duty by the three
Mrs McKails keen grey eyes wander to the fat rosy little man who
laughingly struggled amidst a bevy of children the triplets included
He seems fond of them said she nodding
Seems emphasised Mrs Parry shrewdly Ha I dont trust the man If
he were all he seems would his wifes face wear that expression No
dont tell me
Mrs Morley was a tall lean serious woman dressed in sober grey She
certainly looked careworn and appeared to participate in the
festivities more as a duty than for the sake of amusement He is said
to be a good husband observed Mrs McKail doubtfully Are you sure
Im sure of nothing where men are concerned I wouldnt trust one of
them Morley is attentive enough to his wife and he adores the
tripletsso he says but I go by his eye Orgy is written in that eye
It can pick out a pretty woman my dear Oh his wife doesnt look sick
with anxiety for nothing
At any rate he doesnt seem attentive to that pretty girl over
therethe one in black with the young man
Girl Shes twentyfive if shes an hour I believe she paints and puts
belladonna in her eyes I wouldnt have her for my governess No shes
too artful though I cant agree with you about her prettiness
Is she the governess
Mrs Parry nodded and the ribbons on her cap curled like Medusas
snakes For six months Mrs Morley has put up with her She teaches the
Tricolor goodness knows what
The Tricolor
So we call the triplets Dont you see one is dressed in red another
in white and the third in blue Morleys idea I believe As though a
man had any right to interest himself in such things We call them
collectively the Tricolor and Anne Denham is the governess Pretty No
Artful Yes See how she is trying to fascinate Ware
That handsome young man with the fair moustache and
The same interrupted Mrs Parry too eager to blacken character to
give her friend a chance of concluding her sentence Giles Ware of
Kingshartthe head of one of our oldest Essex families He came into
the estates two years ago and has settled down into a country squire
after a wild life But the old Adam is in him my dear Look at his
smileand she doesnt seem to mind Brazen creature And Mrs Parry
shuddered virtuously
The other lady thought that Ware had a most fascinating smile and was a
remarkably handsome young man of the fair Saxon type He certainly
appeared to be much interested in the conversation of Miss Denham But
what young man could resist so beautiful a woman For in spite of Mrs
Parrys disparagement Anne was a splendidly handsome brunettewith a
temper added Mrs McKail mentally as she eyed the wellsuited couple
Mrs Parrys tongue still raged like a prairie fire And she knows hes
engaged she snorted Look at poor Daisy Kent out in the cold while
that woman monopolizes Ware Ugh
Is Miss Kent engaged to Mr Ware
For three years they have been engageda family arrangement I
understand The late Kent and the late Ware explained Mrs Parry who
always spoke thus politely of men were the greatest of friends which
I can well understand as each was an idiot However Ware died first
and left his estate to Giles A few months later Kent died and made
Morley the guardian of his daughter Daisy already contracted to be
married to Giles
Does he love her
Oh hes fond of her in a way and he is anxious to obey the last wish
of his father But it seems to me that he is more in love with that
black cat
Hush You will be heard
Mrs Parry snorted I hope so and by the cat herself she said
grimly I cant bear the woman If I were Mrs Morley Id have her out
of the house in ten minutes Turn her out in the snow to cool her hot
blood What right has she to attract Ware and make him neglect that dear
angel over there See yonder is Daisy Theres a face theres charm
theres hair finished Mrs Parry quite unconscious that she was using
the latest London slang I call her a lovely creature
Mrs McKail did not agree with her venomous cousin Daisy was a
washedout blonde with large blue eyes and a slack mouth Under a hot
July sky and with a flush of color she would have indeed been pretty
but the cold of winter and the neglect of Giles Ware shrivelled her up
In spite of the warmth of the room the gaiety of the scene she looked
pinched and older than her years But there was some sort of character
in her face for Mrs McKail caught her directing a glance full of
hatred at the governess In spite of her ethereal prettiness Daisy Kent
was a good hater Mrs McKail felt sure of that And she is much more
of the cat type than the other one is thought the observant lady too
wise to speak openly
However Mrs Parry still continued to destroy a character every time
she opened her mouth She called the rector a Papist hinted that the
doctors wife was no better than she should be announced that Morley
owed money to his tradesmen that he had squandered his wifes fortune
and finally wound up by saying that he would spend Daisy Kents money
when he got it If it ever does come to her finished this amiable
person
Did her father leave her money asked Mrs McKail
He snapped the other my dear he was as poor as a church mouse and
left Daisy only a hundred a year to live on That is the one decent
thing about Morley He did take Daisy in and he does treat her well
though to be sure she is a pretty girl and as I say he has an eye
Then where does the fortune come from
Kent was a halfbrother who went out to America and it is rumored that
he made a fortune which he intends to leave to his niecethats Daisy
But I dont know all the details of this added Mrs Parry rubbing her
beaky nose angrily I must find out somehow But here my dear those
children are stripping the tree Let us assist We must give pleasure to
the little ones I have had six of my own all married ended the good
lady irrelevantly
She might have added that her four sons and two daughters kept at a safe
distance from their respected parent On occasions she did pay a visit
to one or the other and usually created a disturbance Yet this
spiteful mischiefmaking woman read her Bible thought herself a
Christian and judged others as harshly as she judged herself leniently
Mrs McKail was stopping with her therefore could not tell her what she
thought of her behavior but she privately determined to cut short her
visit and get away from this disagreeable old creature In the meantime
Mrs Parry smiling like the wicked fairy godmother with many teeth
advanced to meddle with the Christmas tree and set the children by the
ears She was a perfect Ate
Giles said as much to Miss Denham and she nervously agreed with him as
though fearful lest her assent should reach the ears of Mrs Parry
She has no love for me whispered Anne I think you had better talk
to Daisy Mr Ware
I prefer to talk to you said Giles coolly Daisy is like her namea
sweet little English meadow flowerand I love her very dearly But she
has never been out of England and sometimes we are at a loss what to
talk about Now you
I am a gipsy interrupted Anne lest he should say something too
complimentary a sheUlysses who has travelled far and wide In spite
of your preference for my conversation I wish I were Daisy
Do you asked Ware eagerly Why
Anne flushed and threw back her head proudly She could not altogether
misunderstand his meaning or the expression of his eyes but she strove
to turn the conversation with a laugh You ask too many questions Mr
Ware she said coldly I think Daisy is one of the sweetest of girls
and I envy her To have a happy home a kind guardian as Mr Morley is
and a She was about to mention Giles but prudently suppressed the
remark
Go on he said quietly folding his arms
She shook her head and bit her lip You keep me from my work I must
attend to my duties A poor governess you know With a laugh she
joined the band of children who were besieging Morley
Giles remained where he was his eyes fixed moodily on the ground For
more than five months he had fought against an evergrowing passion for
the governess He knew that he was in honor bound to marry Daisy and
that she loved him dearly yet his heart was with Anne Denham Her
beauty her brilliant conversation her charm of manner all appealed to
him strongly And he had a shrewd suspicion that she was not altogether
indifferent to him although she loyally strove to hide her true
feelings Whenever he became tender she ruthlessly laughed at him she
talked constantly of Daisy and of her many charms and on every occasion
strove to throw her into the company of Giles She managed to do so on
this occasion for Giles heard a rather pettish voice at his elbow and
looked down to behold a flushed face Daisy was angry and looked the
prettier for her anger
You have scarcely spoken to me all night she said taking his arm I
do think you are unkind
My dear you have been so busy with the children And indeed he
added with a grave smile you are scarcely more than a child yourself
Daisy
I am woman enough to feel neglect
I apologizeon my knees dearest
Oh its easy saying so pouted Daisy but you know Anne
What about Miss Denham asked Giles outwardly calm
You like her
She is a very charming woman but you are to be my wife Jealous little
girl can I not be ordinarily civil to Miss Denham without you getting
angry
You need not be so very civil
I wont speak to her at all if you like replied Ware with a fine
assumption of carelessness
Oh if you only wouldnt Daisy stoppedthen continued passionately
I wish she would go away I dont like her
She is fond of you Daisy
Yes And a cat is fond of a mouse Mrs Parry says
Dont quote that odious woman child interrupted Ware sharply She
has a bad word for everyone
Well she doesnt like Anne
Does she like anyone asked Giles coolly Come Daisy dont wrinkle
your face and Ill take you out for a drive in my motorcar in a few
days
Tomorrow tomorrow cried Daisy her face wreathed in smiles
No I darent do that on Christmas Day What would the rector say As
the lord of the manor I must set an example On Boxing Day if you like
We will go alone
Certainly Who do you expect me to ask other than you
Anne said Daisy spitefully and before he could reply she also moved
away to join the children Giles winced He felt that he was in the
wrong and had given his little sweetheart some occasion for jealousy He
resolved to mend his ways and shun the too fascinating society of the
enchantress Shaking off his moody feeling he came forward to assist
Morley The host was a little man and could not reach the gifts that
hung on the topmost boughs of the tree Giles being tall and having a
long reach of arm came to his aid
Thats right thats right gasped Morley his round face red and
shining with his exertions the best gifts are up here
As the best gifts of man are from heaven put in Mrs Parry with her
usual tact
Morley laughed Quite so quite so he said careful as was everyone
else not to offend the lady but on this occasion we can obtain the
best gifts I and Ware and Mrs Morley have contributed to the tree The
children have their presents now for the presents of the grownups
By this time the children were gorged with food and distracted by many
presents They were seated everywhere many on the floor and the room
was a chaos of dolls trumpets toyhorses and drums The chatter of
the children and the noise of the instruments was fearful But Morley
seemed to enjoy the riot and even his wifes grave face relaxed when
she saw her three precious jewels rosy with pleasure She drew Annes
attention to them and the governess smiled sympathetically Miss Denham
was popular with everyone save Daisy in that happy home
Meantime Giles handed down the presents Mrs Morley received a chain
purse from her affectionate husband Mrs Parry a silver creamjug
which she immediately priced as cheap Mrs McKail laughed delightedly
over a cigarettecase which she admitted revealed her favorite vice
and the rector was made happy with a motorbicycle
It has been taken to your house this evening explained Morley We
couldnt put that on the tree Ha ha
A muffchain for Daisy said Giles presenting her with the packet
and I hope you will like it dear
Did you buy it she asked sparkling and palpitating
Of course I bought presents both for you and Miss Denham Here is
yours he added turning to the governess who grew rosy a very
simple bangle I wish it were more worthy of your acceptance and he
handed it with a bow
Daisy her heart filled with jealousy glided away Giles saw her face
guessed her feeling and followed In a corner he caught her and placed
something on her finger Our engagement ring he whispered and Daisy
once more smiled Her lover smiled also But his heart was heavy
CHAPTER II
AN ANONYMOUS LETTER
After the riot of the evening came the silence of the night The
children departed amidst the stormy laughter of Morley and it was
Annes task to see that the triplets were put comfortably to bed She
sat in the nursery and watched the washing and undressing and
haircurling and listened to their joyous chatter about the wonderful
presents and the wonderful pleasures of that day Afterwards when they
were safely tucked away she went down to supper and received the
compliments of Morley on her capability in entertaining children Mrs
Morley also and in a more genuine way added her quota of praise
You are my right hand Miss Denham she said with a smile in her
weary blue eyes I dont know what I shall do without you
Oh Miss Denham is not going said the master of the house
Who knows smiled Anne I have always been a wanderer and it may be
that I shall be called away suddenly
It was on the tip of Morleys tongue to ask by whom but the hardening
of Annes face and the flash of her dark eyes made him change his mind
All the same he concluded that there was someone by whom she might be
summoned and guessed also that the obeying of the call would come as an
unwilling duty Mrs Morley saw nothing of this She had not much brain
power and what she had was devoted to considerations dealing with the
passing hour At the present moment she could only think that it was
time for supper and that all present were hungry and tired
Hungry Anne certainly was not but she confessed to feeling weary
Making some excuse she retired to her room but not to sleep When the
door was locked she put on her dressinggown shook down her long black
hair and sat by the fire
Her thoughts were not pleasant Filled with shame at the knowledge of
his treachery towards the woman he was engaged to marry Giles had kept
close to Daisys side during supper and afterwards He strove to
interest himself in her somewhat childish chatter and made her so happy
by his mere presence that her face was shining with smiles Transfigured
by love and by gratified vanity Daisy looked really pretty and in her
heart was scornful of poor Anne thus left out in the cold She concluded
that Giles loved her best after all and did not see how he every now
and then stealthily glanced at the governess wearily striving to
interest herself in the breezy conversation of Morley or the domestic
chatter of his wife In her heart Anne had felt a pang at this
desertion although she knew that it was perfectly justifiable and
unable to bear the sight of Daisys brilliant face she retired thus
early
She loved Giles It was no use blinking the fact She loved him with
every fibre of her nature and with a passion far stronger than could be
felt for him by the goldenhaired doll with the shallow eyes For Giles
she would have lost the world but she would not have him lose his for
her And after all she had no right to creep like a serpent into the
Eden of silly prattling Daisy In her own puny way the childfor she
was little elseadored Giles and as he was her affianced lover it
would be base to come between her and her god But Anne knew in her
heart that Giles loved her best If she did but lift her hand he would
leave all and follow her to the worlds end But lift her hand she would
not It would be too cruel to break the butterfly Daisy on such a
painful wheel Anne loved sufficiently to be large and generous in her
nature and therefore broke her own heart to spare the breaking of
another womans Certainly Giles was as unhappy as she was that was
patent in his looks and bearing But he had forged his own chains and
could not break them without dishonor And come what may Giles would
always love her best
Annes meditations were disturbed by a knock at the door Glancing at
the clock she saw it was close on midnight and wondering who wished to
see her at so late an hour she opened the door Daisy in a blue
dressinggown with her golden hair loose and her face flushed entered
the room She skipped towards Anne with a happy laugh and threw her
arms round her neck
I could not sleep without telling you how happy I am she said and
with a look of triumph displayed the ring
Annes heart beat violently at this visible sign of the barrier between
her and Giles However she was too clever a woman to betray her
emotion and examined the ring with a forced smile
Diamonds for your eyes rubies for your lips she said softly A very
pretty fancy
Daisy was annoyed She would rather that Anne had betrayed herself by
some rude speech or at least by a discomposed manner To make her heart
ache Daisy had come and from all she could see she had not
accomplished her aim However she still tried to wring some sign of
emotion from the expression or lips of the calm governess
Giles promised me a ring over and over again she said her eyes fixed
on Anne We have been engaged for over six months He asked me just
before you came although it was always an understood thing His father
and mine arranged the engagement you know I didnt like the idea at
first as I wanted to make my own choice Every girl should I think
Dont you
Certainly Anne forced herself to say but you love Mr Ware
Daisy nodded Very very much she assented emphatically I must have
loved him without knowing it but I was only certain when he asked me to
marry him How lucky it is he has to make me his wife she sighed If
he were not bound Here she stopped suddenly and looked into the
other womans eyes
What nonsense said Anne goodhumoredly and more composed than ever
Mr Ware loves you dearly You are the one woman he would choose for
his wife There is no compulsion about his choice my dear
Do you really think so demanded the girl feverishly I thoughtit
was the ring you know
What do you mean Daisy
He never would give me the ring although I said it was ridiculous for
a girl to be engaged without one He always made some excuse and only
tonight But I have him safe now she added with a fierce
abruptness and Ill keep him
Nobody wants to take him from you dear
Do you really think so said Miss Kent again Then why did he delay
giving me the ring
Anne knew well enough After her first three meetings with Giles she had
seen the love light in his eyes and his reluctance to bind himself
irrevocably with the ring was due to a hope that something might happen
to permit his choosing for himself But nothing had happened the age of
miracles being past and the vow to his dead father bound him Therefore
on this very night he had locked his shackles and had thrown away the
key Anne had made it plain to him that she could not nor would she
help him to play a dishonorable part He had accepted his destiny and
now Daisy asked why he had not accepted it before Anne made a feeble
excuse the best she could think of
Perhaps he did not see a ring pretty enough she said
It might be that replied Daisy reflectively Giles has such good
taste You did not show me what he gave you tonight
Miss Denham would rather not have shown it but she had no excuse to
refuse a sight of the gift Without a word she slipped the bangle from
her wristDaisys jealous eyes noted that she had kept it on till
nowand handed it to the girl
Oh how sweet and pretty she cried with artificial cordiality Just
a ring of gold with a coin attached May I look And without waiting
for permission she ran to the lamp
The coin was a halfsovereign of Edward VII with three stonesa
diamond an amethyst and a pearlset in a triangle A thin ring of
gold attached it to the bangle Daisy was not ill pleased that the gift
was so simple Her engagement ring was much more costly
Its a cheap thing she said contemptuously The coin is quite
common
It will be rare some day said Anne slipping the bangle on her wrist
The name of the King is spelt on this one Edwardus whereas in the
Latin it should be Edvardus I believe the issue is to be called in
Consequently coins of this sort will be rare some day It was kind of
Mr Ware to give it to me
Daisy paid no attention to this explanation An amethyst a diamond
and a pearl she said Why did he have those three stones set in the
halfsovereign
Anne turned away her face for it was burning red She knew very well
what the stones signified but she was not going to tell this jealous
creature Daisys wits however were made keen by her secret anger and
after a few moments of thought she jumped up clapping her hands
I see itthe initials of your name Amethyst stands for Anne and
Diamond for Denham
It might be so replied Miss Denham coldly
It is so said Daisy her small face growing white and pinched But
what does the pearl mean Ah that you are a pearl
Nonsense Daisy Go you to bed and dont imagine things
It is not imagination cried the girl shrilly and you know that
well Anne What right have you to come and steal Giles from me
He is yours said Anne sharply The ring
Oh yes the ring I have his promise to marry me but you have his
heart Dont I know Give me that bangle And she stretched out her
hand with a clutching gesture
No said Anne sternly I shall keep my present Go to bed You are
overtired Tomorrow you will be wiser
I am wise nowtoo wise You have made Giles love you
I have not I swear I have not said Anne beginning to lose her
composure
You have and you love him I see it in your face Who are you to come
into my life and spoil it
I am a governess That is all you need to know
You look like a governess said Daisy insultingly I believe you are
a bad woman and came here to steal Giles from me
DaisyAnne rose to her feet and walked towards the doorI have had
quite enough of your hysterical nonsense If you came here to insult me
in this way it is time you went Mr Ware and I were complete strangers
to one another when I came here
Strangers And what are you now
Friendsnothing more nothing less
So you say and I daresay Giles would say the same thing did I ask
him
Annes face grew white and set She seized the foolish hysterical
little creature by the wrist and shook her Ill tell you one thing
she said softly and her threat was the more terrible for the softness
I have black blood in my veins for I was born at Martinique and if
you talk to Giles about me IllIllkill you Go and pray to God
that you may be rid of this foolishness
Daisy wideeyed pallid and thoroughly frightened fled whimpering
and sought refuge in her own room Anne closed the door and locked it
so as to prevent a repetition of this unpleasant visit Then she went to
open the window for the air of the room seemed tainted by the presence
of Daisy Flinging wide the casement Anne leaned out into the bitter
air and looked at the wonderful white snowworld glittering in the thin
chill moonlight She drew several long breaths and became more
composed Sufficient indeed to wonder why she had behaved in so
melodramatic a fashion It was not her custom to so far break through
the conventions of civilization But the insults of Daisy had stirred in
her that wild negro blood to which she had referred That this girl who
had all should grudge her the simple Christmas present made Anne
furious Yet in spite of her righteous anger she could not help feeling
sorry for Daisy And after all the girls jealousy had some foundation
in truth Anne had given her no cause but she could not deny that she
loved Giles and that he loved her To end an impossible situation there
was nothing for it but flight
Next day Anne quite determined to give Mrs Morley notice but when she
found that Daisy said nothing about her visit she decided to remain
silent Unless the girl made herself impossible Anne did not see why
she should turn out of a good situation where she was earning excellent
wages Daisy avoided her and was coldly polite on such occasions as
they had to speak Seeing this Anne forbore to force her company upon
the unhappy girl and attended to her duties
These were sufficiently pleasant for the three children adored her
They were not clever but extremely pretty and gentle in their manners
Mrs Morley often came to sit and sew in the schoolroom while Anne
taught She was fond of the quiet calm governess and prattled to her
just as though she were a child herself of the perfections of Mr Morley
and her unhappy early life For the sake of the children she forbore to
mention the name of their father who from her account had been a sad
rascal
Giles came sometimes to dine but attended chiefly to Daisy Anne was
content that this should be so and her rival made the most of the small
triumph Indeed so attentive was Giles that Daisy came to believe she
