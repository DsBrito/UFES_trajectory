who had passed the Yorkshire relish sat silent and listless her food
untouched and her wine untasted She was small and thin her face
looked haggard She was a newcomer and had indeed arrived at
Petershof only two hours before the tabledhote bell rang But there
did not seem to be any nervous shrinking in her manner nor any shyness
at having to face the two hundred and fifty guests of the Kurhaus She
seemed rather to be unaware of their presence or if aware of
certainly indifferent to the scrutiny under which she was being placed
She was recalled to reality by the voice of the Disagreeable Man She
did not hear what he said but she mechanically stretched out her hand
and passed him the mustardpot
Is that what you asked for she said half dreamily or was it the
waterbottle
You are rather deaf I should think said the Disagreeable Man
placidly I only remarked that it was a pity you were not eating your
dinner Perhaps the scrutiny of the two hundred and fifty guests in
this civilized place is a vexation to you
I did not know they were scrutinizing she answered and even if
they are what does it matter to me I am sure I am quite too tired to
care
Why have you come here asked the Disagreeable Man suddenly
Probably for the same reason as yourself she said to get better
or well
You wont get better he answered cruelly I know your type well
you burn yourselves out quickly Andmy Godhow I envy you
So you have pronounced my doom she said looking at him intently
Then she laughed but there was no merriment in the laughter
Listen she said as she bent nearer to him because you are
hopeless it does not follow that you should try to make others
hopeless too You have drunk deep of the cup of poison I can see that
To hand the cup on to others is the part of a coward
She walked past the English table and the Polish table and so out of
the Kurhaus dininghall
CHAPTER II
CONTAINS A FEW DETAILS
IN an old secondhand bookshop in London an old man sat reading
Gibbons History of Rome He did not put down his book when the postman
brought him a letter He just glanced indifferently at the letter and
impatiently at the postman Zerviah Holme did not like to be interrupted
when he was reading Gibbon and as he was always reading Gibbon an
interruption was always regarded by him as an insult
About two hours afterwards he opened the letter and learnt that his
niece Bernardine had arrived safely in Petershof and that she
intended to get better and come home strong He tore up the letter
and instinctively turned to the photograph on the mantelpiece It was
the picture of a face young and yet old sad and yet with possibilities
of merriment thin and drawn and almost wrinkled and with piercing eyes
which even in the dull lifelessness of the photograph seemed to be
burning themselves away Not a pleasing nor a good face yet intensely
pathetic because of its undisguised harassment
Zerviah looked at it for a moment
She has never been much to either of us he said to himself And yet
when Malvina was alive I used to think that she was hard on Bernardine
I believe I said so once or twice But Malvina had her own way of
looking at things Well that is over now
He then with characteristic speed dismissed all thoughts which did not
relate to Roman History and the remembrance of Malvina his wife and
Bernardine his niece took up an accustomed position in the background
of his mind
Bernardine had suffered a cheerless childhood in which dolls and toys
took no leading part She had no affection to bestow on any doll nor
any woolly lamb nor apparently on any human person unless perhaps
there was the possibility of a friendly inclination towards Uncle
Zerviah who would not have understood the value of any deeper feeling
and did not therefore call the child coldhearted and unresponsive as
he might well have done
This she certainly was judged by the standard of other children but
then no softening influences had been at work during her tenderest
years Aunt Malvina knew as much about sympathy as she did about the
properties of an ellipse and even the fairies had failed to win little
Bernardine At first they tried with loving patience what they might do
for her they came out of their books and danced and sang to her and
whispered sweet stories to her at twilight the fairies own time But
she would have none of them for all their gentle persuasion So they
gave up trying to please her and left her as they had found her
loveless What can be said of a childhood which even the fairies have
failed to touch with the warm glow of affection
Such a little restless spirit striving to express itself now in this
direction now in that yet always actuated by the same constant force
the desire for work Bernardine seemed to have no special wish to be
useful to others she seemed just to have a natural tendency to work
even as others have a natural tendency to play She was always in
earnest life for little Bernardine meant something serious
Then the years went by  She grew up and filled her life with many
interests and ambitions  She was at least a worker if nothing else
she had always been a diligent scholar and now she took her place as an
able teacher She was selfreliant and perhaps somewhat conceited
But at least Bernardine the young woman had learnt something which
Bernardine the young child had not been able to learn she learnt how
to smile  It took her about six and twenty years to learn still
some people take longer than that in fact many never learn This is
a brief summary of Bernardine Holmes past
Then one day when she was in the full swing of her many engrossing
occupations teaching writing articles for newspapers attending
socialistic meetings and taking part in political discussionsshe was
essentially a modern product this Bernardineone day she fell ill
She lingered in London for some time and then she went to Petershof
CHAPTER III
MRS REFFOLD LEARNS A LESSON
PETERSHOF was a winter resort for consumptive patients though indeed
many people simply needed the change of a bracing climate went there to
spend a few months and came away wonderfully better for the mountain
air This was what Bernardine Holme hoped to do she was broken down in
every way but it was thought that a prolonged stay in Petershof might
help her back to a reasonable amount of health or at least prevent
her from slipping into further decline She had come alone because she
had no relations except that old uncle and no money to pay any friend
who might have been willing to come with her But she probably cared
very little and the morning after her arrival she strolled out by
herself investigating the place where she was about to spend six months
She was dragging herself along when she met the Disagreeable Man She
stopped him He was not accustomed to be stopped by any one and he
looked rather astonished
You were not very cheering last night she said to him
I believe I am not generally considered to be lively he answered as
he knocked the snow of his boot
Still I am sorry I spoke to you as I did she went on frankly It
was foolish of me to mind what you said
He made no reference to his own remark and passing on his way again
when he turned back and walked with her
I have been here nearly seven years he said and there was a ring of
sadness in his voice as he spoke which he immediately corrected If
you want to know anything about the place I can tell you If you are
able to walk I can show you some lovely spots where you will not be
bothered with people I can take you to a snow fairyland If you are
sad and disappointed you will find shining comfort there It is not
all sadness in Petershof In the silent snow forests if you dig the
snow away you will find the tiny buds nestling in their white nursery
If the sun does not dazzle your eyes you may always see the great
mountains piercing the sky These wonders have been a happiness to me
You are not too ill but that they may be a happiness to you also
Nothing can be much of a happiness to me she said half to herself
and her lips quivered I have had to give up so much all my work
all my ambitions
You are not the only one who has had to do that he said sharply
Why make a fuss Things arrange themselves and eventually we adjust
ourselves to the new arrangement A great deal of caring and grieving
phase one still more caring and grieving phase two less caring and
grieving phase three no further feeling whatsoever phase four
Mercifully I am at phase four You are at phase one Make a quick
journey over the stages
He turned and left her and she strolled along thinking of his words
wondering how long it would take her to arrive at his indifference
She had always looked upon indifference as paralysis of the soul and
paralysis meant death nay was worse than death And here was this man
who had obviously suffered both mentally and physically telling her
that the only sensible course was to learn not to care How could she
learn not to care All her life long she had studied and worked and
cultivated herself in every direction in the hope of being able to take
a high place in literature or in any case to do something in life
distinctly better than what other people did When everything was coming
near to her grasp when there seemed a fair chance of realizing her
ambitions she had suddenly fallen ill broken up so entirely in every
way that those who knew her when she was well could scarcely recognize
her now that she was ill The doctors spoke of an overstrained nervous
system the pestilence of these modern days they spoke of rest change
of work and scene bracing air She might regain her vitality she might
not Those who had played themselves out must pay the penalty She was
thinking of her whole history pitying herself profoundly coming to
the conclusion after true human fashion that she was the worstused
person on earth and that no one but herself knew what disappointed
ambitions were she was thinking of all this and looking profoundly
miserable and martyrlike when some one called her by her name She
looked round and saw one of the English ladies belonging to the Kurhaus
Bernardine had noticed her the previous night She seemed in capital
spirits and had three or four admirers waiting on her very words
She was a tall handsome woman dressed in a superb furtrimmed cloak
a woman of splendid bearing and address Bernardine looked a
contemptible little piece of humanity beside her Some such impression
conveyed itself to the two men who were walking with Mrs Reffold
They looked at the one woman and then at the other and smiled at each
other as men do smile on such occasions
I am going to speak to this little thing Mrs Reffold had said to
her two companions before they came near Bernardine I must find out
who she is and where she comes from And fancy she has come quite
alone I have inquired How hopelessly out of fashion she dresses
And what a hat
I should not take the trouble to speak to her said one of the men
She may fasten herself on to you You know what a bore that is
Oh I can easily snub any one if I wish replied Mrs Reffold
rather disdainfully
So she hastened up to Bernardine and held out her wellgloved hand
I had not a chance of speaking to you last night Miss Holme she
said You retired so early I hope you have rested after your journey
You seemed quite worn out
Thank you said Bernardine looking admiringly at the beautiful woman
and envying her just as all plain women envy their handsome sisters
You are not alone I suppose continued Mrs Reffold
Yes quite alone answered Bernardine
But you are evidently acquainted with Mr Allitsen your neighbour at
table said Mrs Reffold so you will not feel quite lonely here
It is a great advantage to have a friend at a place like this
I never saw him before last night said Bernardine
Is it possible said Mrs Reffold in her pleasantest voice Then
you have made a triumph of the Disagreeable Man He very rarely deigns
to talk with any of us He does not even appear to see us He sits
quietly and reads It would be interesting to hear what his conversation
is like I should be quite amused to know what you did talk about
I dare say you would said Bernardine quietly
Then Mrs Behold wishing to screen her inquisitiveness plunged into a
description of Petershof life speaking enthusiastically about
everything except the scenery which she did not mention After a time
she ventured to begin once more taking soundings But some how or other
those bright eyes of Bernardine which looked at her so searchingly
made her a little nervous and perhaps a little indiscreet
Your father will miss you she said tentatively
I should think probably not answered Bernardine One is not easily
missed you know There was a twinkle in Bernardines eye as she added
He is probably occupied with other things
What is your father asked Mrs Reffold in her most coaxing tones
I dont know what he is now answered Bernardine placidly But he
was a genius He is dead
Mrs Reffold gave a slight start for she began to feel that this
insignificant little person was making fun of her This would never do
and before witnesses too So she gathered together her best resources
and said
Dear me how very unfortunate a genius too Death is indeed cruel
And here one sees so much of it that unless one learns to steel ones
heart one becomes melancholy Ah it is indeed sad to see all this
suffering Mrs Reffold herself had quite succeeded in steeling her
heart against her own invalid husband She then gave an account of
several bad cases of consumption not forgetting to mention two
instances of suicide which had lately taken place in Petershof
One gentleman was a Russian she said Fancy coming all the way
from Russia to this little outoftheworld place But people come from
the uttermost ends of the earth though of course there are many
Londoners here  I suppose you are from London
I am not living in London now said Bernardine cautiously
But you know it without doubt continued Mrs Reffold There are
several Kensington people here You may meet some friends indeed in
our hotel there are two or three families from Lexham Gardens
Bernardine smiled a little viciously looked first at Mrs Reffolds
two companions with an amused sort of indulgence and then at the lady
herself She paused a moment and then said
Have you asked all the questions you wish to ask And if so may I
ask one of you Where does one get the best tea
Mrs Reffold gave an inward gasp but pointed gracefully to a small
confectionery shop on the other side of the road Mrs Reffold did
everything gracefully
Bernardine thanked her crossed the road and passed into the shop
Now I have taught her a lesson not to interfere with me said
Bernardine to herself How beautiful she is
Mrs Reffold and her two companions went silently on their way
At last the silence was broken
Well Im blessed said the taller of the two lighting a cigar
So am I said the other lighting his cigar too
Those are precisely my own feelings remarked Mrs Reffold
But she had learnt her lesson
CHAPTER IV
CONCERNING WAeRLI AND MARIE
WAeRLI the little hunchback postman a cheery soul came whistling up
the Kurhaus stairs carrying with him that precious parcel of registered
letters which gave him the position of being the most important person
in Petershof He was a linguist too was Waerli and could speak broken
English in a most fascinating way agreeable to every one but
intelligible only to himself Well he came whistling up the stairs
when he heard Maries blithe voice humming her favourite spinningsong
Ei Ei he said to himself Marie is in a good temper today I will
give her a call as I pass
He arranged his neckerchief and smoothed his curls and when he reached
the end of the landing he paused outside a little glassdoor and all
unobserved watched Marie in her pantry cleaning the candlesticks and
lamps
Marie heard a knock and looking up from her work saw Waerli
Good day Waerli she said glancing hurriedly at a tiny broken mirror
suspended on the wall I suppose you have a letter for me How
delightful
Never mind about the letter just now he said waving his hand as
though wishing to dismiss the subject How nice to hear you singing
so sweetly Marie Dear me in the old days at Gruesch how often I have
heard that song of the spinningwheels You have forgotten the old days
Marie though you remember the song
Give me my letter Waerli and go about your work said Marie
pretending to be impatient But all the same her eyes looked extremely
friendly There was something very winning about the hunchbacks face
Ah ah Marie he said shaking his curly head I know how it is
with you you only like people in fine binding They have not always
fine hearts
What nonsense you talk Waerli said Marie There just hand me the
oilcan You can fill this lamp for me Not too full you goose And
this one also ah youre letting the oil trickle down  Why youre
not fit for anything except carrying letters Here give me my letter
What pretty flowers said Waerli Now if there is one thing I do like
it is a flower Can you spare me one Marie Put one in my buttonhole
do
You are a nuisance this afternoon said Marie smiling and pinning a
flower on Waerlis blue coat Just then a bell rang violently
Those Portuguese ladies will drive me quite mad said Marie They
always ring just when I am enjoying myself
When you an enjoying yourself said Waerli triumphantly
Of course returned Marie I always do enjoy cleaning the oillamps
I always did
Ah Id forgotten the oillamps said Waerli
And so had I laughed Marie Na na there goes that bell again
Wont they be angry Wont they scold at me Here Waerli give me my
letter and Ill be off
I never told you I had any letter for you remarked Waerli It was
entirely your own idea Good afternoon Fraeulein Marie
The Portuguese ladies bell rang again still more passionately this
time but Marie did not seem to hear nor care She wished to be
revenged on that impudent postman She went to the top of the stairs
and called after Waerli in her most coaxing tones
Do step down one moment I want to show you something
I must deliver the registered letters said Waerli with official
haughtiness I have already wasted too much of my time
Wont you waste a few more minutes on me pleaded Marie pathetically
It is not often I see you now
Waerli came down again looking very happy
I want to show you such a beautiful photograph Ive had taken said
Marie Ach it is beautiful
You must give one to me said Waerli eagerly
Oh I cant do that replied Marie as she opened the drawer and took
out a small packet It was a present to me from the Polish gentleman
himself He saw me the other day here in the pantry I was so tired
and I had fallen asleep with my broom just as you see me here So he
made a photograph of me He admires me very much Isnt it nice and
isnt the Polish gentleman clever and isnt it nice to have so much
attention paid to one Oh theres that horrid bell again Good
afternoon Herr Waerli That is all I have to say to you thank you
Waerlis feelings towards the Polish gentleman were not of the
friendliest that day
CHAPTER V
THE DISAGREEABLE MAN
ROBERT ALLITSEN told Bernardine that she was not likely to be on
friendly terms with the English people in the Kurhaus
They will not care about you and you will not care about the
foreigners So you will thus be thrown on your own resources
just as I was when I came
I cannot say that I have any resources Bernardine answered I dont
feel well enough to try to do any writing or else it would be
delightful to have the uninterrupted leisure
So she had probably told him a little about her life and occupation
although it was not likely that she would have given him any serious
confidences Still people are often surprisingly frank about
themselves even those who pride themselves upon being the most
reticent mortals in the world
But now having the leisure she continued I have not the brains
I never knew any writer who had said the Disagreeable Man grimly
Perhaps your experience has been limited she suggested
Why dont you read he said There is a good library here It
contains all the books we dont want to read
I am tired of reading Bernardine said I seem to have been reading
all my life My uncle with whom I live keeps a secondhand bookshop
and ever since I can remember I have been surrounded by books They
have not done me much good nor any one else either
No probably not he said But now that you have left off reading
you will have a chance of learning something if you live long enough
It is wonderful how much one does learn when one does not read It is
almost awful If you dont care about reading now why do you not
occupy yourself with cheesemites
I do not feel drawn towards cheesemites
Perhaps not at first but all the same they form a subject which is
very engaging Or any branch of bacteriology
Well if you were to lend me your microscope perhaps I might begin
I could not do that he answered quickly I never lend my things
No I did not suppose you would she said I knew I was safe in
making the suggestion
You are rather quick of perception in spite of all your book reading
he said Yes you are quite right I am selfish I dislike lending my
things and I dislike spending my money except on myself If you have
the misfortune to linger on as I do you will know that it is perfectly
legitimate to be selfish in small things if one has made the one
great sacrifice
And what may that be
She asked so eagerly that he looked at her and then saw how worn and
tired her face was and the words which he was intending to speak
died on his lips
Look at those asses of people on toboggans he said brusquely Could
you manage to enjoy yourself in that way That might do you good
Yes she said but it would not be any pleasure to me
She stopped to watch the toboggans flying down the road And the
Disagreeable Man went his own solitary way a forlorn figure with a
face almost expressionless and a manner wholly impenetrable
He had lived nearly seven years at Petershof and like many others was
obliged to continue staying there if he wished to continue staying in
this planet It was not probable that he had any wish to prolong his
frail existence but he did his duty to his mother by conserving his
life and this feeble flame of duty and affection was the only lingering
bit of warmth in a heart frozen almost by ill health and disappointed
ambitions The moralists tell us that suffering ennobles and that a
right acceptation of hindrances goes towards forming a beautiful
character But this result must largely depend on the original
character certainly in the case of Robert Allitsen suffering had not
ennobled his mind nor disappointment sweetened his disposition His
title of Disagreeable Man had been fairly earned and he hugged it to
himself with a triumphant secret satisfaction
There were some people in Petershof who were inclined to believe certain
absurd rumours about his alleged kindness It was said that on more than
one occasion he had nursed the suffering and the dying in sad Petershof
and with all the sorrowful tenderness worthy of a loving mother had
helped them to take their leave of life But these were only rumours
and there was nothing in Robert Allitsens ordinary bearing to justify
such talk So the foolish people who for the sake of making themselves
peculiar revived these unlikely fictions were speedily ridiculed and
reduced to silence And the Disagreeable Man remained the Disagreeable
Man with a clean record for unamiability
He lived a life apart from others Most of his time was occupied in
photography or in the use and study of the microscope or in chemistry
His photographs were considered to be most beautiful Not that he showed
them specially to any one but he generally sent a specimen of his work
to the Monthly Photograph Portfolio and hence it was that people
learned to know of his skill He might be seen any fine day trudging
along in company with his photographic apparatus and a desolate dog
who looked almost as cheerless as his chosen comrade Neither the one
took any notice of the other Allitsen was no more genial to the dog
than he was to the Kurhaus guests the dog was no more demonstrative
to Robert Allitsen than he was to any one in Petershof
Still they were something to each other that unexplainable
something which has to explain almost every kind of attachment
He had no friends in Petershof and apparently had no friends anywhere
No one wrote to him except his old mother the papers which were sent
to him came from a stationers
He read all during mealtime But now and again he spoke a few words
with Bernardine Holme whose place was next to him It never occurred
to him to say good morning nor to give a greeting of any kind nor to
show a courtesy One day during lunch however he did take the trouble
to stoop and pick up Bernardine Holmes shawl which had fallen for the
third time to the ground
I never saw a female wear a shawl more carelessly than you he said
You dont seem to know anything about it
His manner was always gruff Every one complained of him Every one
always had complained of him He had never been heard to laugh Once
or twice he had been seen to smile on occasions when people talked
confidently of recovering their health It was a beautiful smile worthy
of a better cause It was a smile which made one pause to wonder what
could have been the original disposition of the Disagreeable Man before
illhealth had cut him off from the affairs of active life Was he happy
or unhappy It was not known He gave no sign of either the one state or
the other He always looked very ill but he did not seem to get worse
He had never been known to make the faintest allusion to his own health
He never smoked his thermometer in public and this was the more
remarkable in an hotel where people would even leave off a conversation
and say Excuse me Sir or Madam I must now take my temperature We
will resume the topic in a few minutes
He never lent any papers or books and he never borrowed any
He had a room at the top of the hotel and he lived his life amongst
his chemistry bottles his scientific books his microscope and his
camera He never sat in any of the hotel drawingrooms There was
nothing striking nor eccentric about his appearance He was neither
ugly nor goodlooking neither tall nor short neither fair nor dark
He was thin and frail and rather bent But that might be the
description of any one in Petershof There was nothing pathetic about
him no suggestion even of poetry which gives a reverence to suffering
whether mental or physical As there was no expression on his face
so also there was no expression in his eyes no distant longing no
faroff fixedness nothing indeed to awaken sad sympathy
The only positive thing about him was his rudeness Was it natural or
cultivated No one in Petershof could say He had always been as he was
and there was no reason to suppose that he would ever be different
He was in fact like the glacier of which he had such a fine view from
his room like the glacier an unchanging feature of the neighbourhood
No one loved it better than the Disagreeable Man did he watched the
sunlight on it now pale golden now fiery red He loved the sky the
dull grey or the bright blue He loved the snow forests and the
snowgirt streams and the ice cathedrals and the great firs patient
beneath their snowburden He loved the frozen waterfalls and the
costly diamonds in the snow He knew too where the flowers nestled
in their white nursery He was indeed an authority on Alpine botany
The same tender hands which plucked the flowers in the springtime
dissected them and laid them bare beneath the microscope But he did
not love them the less for that
Were these pursuits a comfort to him Did they help him to forget that
there was a time when he too was burning with ambition to distinguish
himself and be one of the marked men of the age
Who could say
CHAPTER VI
THE TRAVELLER AND THE TEMPLE OF KNOWLEDGE
COUNTLESS ages ago a Traveller much worn with journeying climbed up
the last bit of rough road which led to the summit of a high mountain
There was a temple on that mountain And the Traveller had vowed that
he would reach it before death prevented him He knew the journey was
long and the road rough He knew that the mountain was the most
difficult of ascent of that mountain chain called The Ideals  But
he had a stronglyhoping heart and a sure foot He lost all sense of
time but he never lost the feeling of hope
Even if I faint by the wayside he said to himself and am not
able to reach the summit still it is something to be on the road
which leads to the High Ideals
That was how he comforted himself when he was weary He never lost
more hope than that and surely that was little enough
And now he had reached the temple
He rang the bell and an old whitehaired man opened the gate He
smiled sadly when he saw the Traveller
And yet another one he murmured What does it all mean
The Traveller did not hear what he murmured
Old whitehaired man he said tell me and so I have come at last
to the wonderful Temple of Knowledge I have been journeying hither all
my life Ah but it is hard work climbing up to the Ideals
The old man touched the Traveller on the arm Listen he said gently
This is not the Temple of Knowledge And the Ideals are not a chain of
mountains they are a stretch of plains and the Temple of Knowledge is
in their centre You have come the wrong road Alas poor Traveller
The light in the Travellers eyes had faded The hope in his heart died
And he became old and withered He leaned heavily on his staff
Can one rest here he asked wearily
No
Is there a way down the other side of these mountains
No
What are these mountains called
They have no name
