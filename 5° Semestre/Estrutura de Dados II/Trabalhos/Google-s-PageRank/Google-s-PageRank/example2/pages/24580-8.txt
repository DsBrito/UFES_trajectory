you very much against your word and

PREFACE
Whatever the effect of ShipBored upon others its publication has
exerted a very definite effect upon me or rather upon the character of
my daily mail Instead of letters the postman now leaves little packages
containing pills which according to the senders will prevent the
casting of bread upon the waters
It is astonishing to learn how many seasick remedies there are
Looking at the bottles and the boxes piled each morning by my breakfast
plate I sometimes wonder if there arent as many remedies as sufferers
But suppose there are Why do people send the medicines to me Why do
perfect strangers assume that because I have taken up the task of
muckraking the Atlantic Ocean I am in need of antidotes for mal de
mer Even suppose that I do suffer thus at sea Is it anybody elses
businessor luncheon
All great literary works are born of suffering Stop the suffering and
you stop the author Yet people keep on sending pills to meeach pill
an added insult if you choose to take it that way
But I dont take them that way I dont take them at all I try them on
my friends When a friend of mine is sailing I send him a few pills out
of a recent bottle If he reports that he was seasick I throw away the
balance of the bottle The same if he dies That shows that the pills
are too strong
I do not wish to take undue credit to myself for conducting these
experiments Since the pills are given to me my researches cost me
nothingexcepting an occasional friend whom as he was sailing for
Europe anyway I should not be able to see even if he were alive

SHIPBORED
When the cabin portholes are dark and green
Because of the seas outside
When the ship goes wop with a wiggle between
And the steward falls into the souptureen
And the trunks begin to slide
When Nursey lies on the floor in a heap
And Mummy tells you to let her sleep
And you arent waked or washed or dressed
Why then you will know if you havent guessed
Youre Fifty North and Forty West
JustSo Stories
Now run dear Thats the gangway You take the baby and Ill take the
fitted bag Yes I have the seasick tablets theyre here in my pocket
with the tickets and the letters of credit and the travellers cheques
and the babys mittens and the trunk keys and theWell I dont care
whos here to see us off People ought to know better Now hurry up
There goes the whistle
It is an awful quarter of an hour that quarter of an hour before the
liner sails that worrying waving whooping whistling quarter of an
hour through which you stand on deck like a human centrepiece loaded
with candy fruit and flowers surrounded by a phantasmagoria of
friendly faces talking like a dancingman and feeling like a dancing
dervish Small wonder that the deafening whistleblast and cry of All
ashore smite sweetly on your ears Small wonder that you hand a dollar
to your sister and kiss the porter who has brought your steamerrugs
Ah blessed moment when the dock begins to move away with all those
laughing crying waving shouting people when snubnosed tugs begin to
warp the ship into the stream when the final howlings of the
megaphonomaniacs sound dim Bon voyage Charlie Take care of
yourself old man Think of me in gay Parree
Illustration SMALL WONDER THAT YOU HAND A DOLLAR TO YOUR SISTER AND
KISS THE PORTER
You lean in a dazed way upon the rail turning on maudlin grins and
waving your cap at no one in particular until the crowd becomes a
moving blur upon the dockend The liners nose points down the river
gentle vibrations tell you she is under way small craft dip flags and
toot as they go by the manmade mountain of Manhattans office
buildings drops astern the statue of Liberty the shores of Staten
Island the flat back of Sandy Hook run past as though wound on rollers
the pilot goes over the side with a bag of farewell letters the white
yacht which has followed down the bay blows a parting blast dips her
ensign and swings in a wide circle toward New York the pursuing tug
comes up and puts a tardy passenger aboard Then suddenly like a
sleepwalking dragon that wakes up the liner shakes herself her
propellers lash the sea to suds a wedgeshaped wake spreads out behind
her and the voyage is on in earnest
Reno Roosevelt Trusts Wall Street High Buildings High Tariff High
Cost of Living Graft Yellow Journals Family Hotels the Six Best
Sellers the Sixty Worst Writers the Four Hundred the Hundred Million
all the things which go to make home sweet lie astern enveloped in the
haze at the horizon You are on the sea at lastthe vast and tireless
sea which has been the inspiration of painter poet and pirate the
cradle of Columbus Nelson Paul Jones Dewey Hobson and Annette
Kellerman
What is there like the sea What is there like the free swing of a
gallant ship breasting the Atlantic Nothing Lets sit down No I
dont want to go and get my coat Im not so terribly cold yet and my
stateroom smells of rubber and fresh paint I like it better up here
in the air dont you Im very fond of the fresh air I really adore
it No it doesnt always give me a good colour Not always If Im
pale it is only because I sat up late last night at that farewell
dinner Perhaps I ate too much Lets just stay here quietly in our
deckchairs and watch the people
But goodness How theyve changed Where are all those pretty
fashionable women who were on deck before we sailed Where for
instance is the adorable blonde with the seal coat orchids low shoes
silk stockings and cough
A certain cynical friend of mine would answer this inquiry by declaring
that all the attractive women go ashore having only come to see their
homely relatives and friends depart But I dont think so I believe the
pretty ones are here though in seclusion or disguise
Nothing of them that doth fade
But doth suffer a seachange
at the first touch of Neptunes hand Only the professional mermaid can
look well at sea The other women either lie on deck in pale green rows
and live throughout the voyage on sea biscuits and sherry or giving up
completely seek burrows in the ship and hibernate like animals awaiting
spring Yes even now I think I recognise the blonde divinity Shes the
third one from the end in that row of steamerchairs in the wide part of
the deck Her orchids lie disconsolate upon her chest her eyes are
closed her hair blows in straight strawlike strings across her
colourless face her hat is on one ear and she is wrapped like a mummy
in an atrocious rug of pink and olive plaid
Illustration I RECOGNIZE THE BLONDE DIVINITY HER EYES ARE CLOSED HER
HAT ON ONE EAR AND SHE IS WRAPPED LIKE A MUMMY
Of course theres always the exception the rosycheeked plaidcoated
creature who walks the deck without a hat and lets the ringlets blow
about her face Her hair curls with the dampness Her colour heightens
with the seas and winds You might suspect her of a golden scaly tail
and fins excepting that you see her tiny wellshod feet as they
step out firmly on the deck They never step alone There are lots of
other feet and larger that delight in stepping with them The very
wind that loves her wafts her friendswafts them with tobaccosmoke as
like as not
I beg your pardon does this smoke trouble you
Oh no Not in the least
My brothers all smoke I       Cigar
adore the smell of a good      Pipe
Keep right on please      Cigarette
Thanks awfully Perhaps youd like to walk around to the other side and
see the lightship
Oh thanks She thanks him for the lightship as if it were a bunch
of roses
And so they walk and walk and walk and walkshe near the rail he
careering on beside her hurdling over the footrests of the rows of
steamerchairs and tripping now and then upon the feet extending from
them And sometimes she sits down and shows him magazines which he has
seen before and he leans over very far and points to things and she
points too and his hand touches hers and he begs pardon and she
excuses him of course and laughsand little locks of hair have
touched his cheek And then they walk again and then she feeds him
chocolates sent by some poor chap who had to stay behind with her own
rosy fingertips and then another light looms up ahead all golden and
thenHow short the voyage has seemed
Ah feet that twinkle cheeks that hold your roses when the world is
tottering and green Ah youth Ah blowing curls Ah Delta Kappa
Epsilon Ah Alpha and Omega Ah snapshots shuffleboard and sea Ah
confidences beside a lifeboat on the upper deck And I was taken
with you from the second that I saw you
And I with you
Were youhonestly
Yes dear
Dearest
Of course we didnt overhear them it was the third lifeboat on the
port side of the ship that overheard as it has overheard so many other
times on other voyages
As for ourselves we were not even up there but were sitting in the
lounge trying as I recollect to match passengers with names upon the
sailing list and failing very badly The woman whom we picked for Mrs
H Van Rensselaer Somebody travelling with two maids two valets one
Pomeranian one husband and no children proves to be a Broadway
showgirl and the one we dubbed a duchess the proprietor of a Fifth
Avenue frockfoundry Showgirls milliners and dressmakers are very
often the smart people of the ship and it must be regretfully
admitted that duchesses too often fail to mark themselves by that
arrogance and overdress which freeborn American citizens have a right
to expect of them
It always seems to me they ought to put the peers and persons of
interest at the head of the passengerlist but they do not The first
place on the list of every liner is reserved for Mr Aaron precisely as
the last place is invariably held for Mr Zwissler But though the
alphabetical roller irons out our names in rows it does not iron out
our tastes and personalities We may still be quite as common or
exclusive as we wish Take for instance the H Van Rensselaer
Somebodys of New York Newport and Paris Low down on the list they
are nevertheless up high on the ship They will remain throughout the
voyage upon the topmost deck cabins de luxe A B C and D in a state
of exclusive and elegant seasickness You will not see them
They have absolutely nothing in common with any of the other
passengersexcepting mal de mer and perchance a wife or husband
exofficio
Illustration HOW THE SHIP ROLLS AND LURCHES
Of course we have an operasinger on boarda lady with a figure like
the profile of a disc record No home on the rolling deep can be
complete without one You feel as if you really knew her personally
having heard her voice so often upon your coffeemill at home And of
course we have an actor or an actress with us A liner might as well
attempt to go to sea without a rudder as without one
Also if we are to have full measure there must be on board a
playwright or a novelist a scientific man an absconder a bishop a
transatlantic sharper a group of nasal people personally conducted by
a man with a sad patient face a lord or at the very least a baron
and some counts The other passengers are for the most part colourless
and quiet people like ourselves
The men upon a liner are divided into two broad classes the deck crowd
and the smokeroom crowd I can not tell you much about the former as I
see them only now and then at meals but the smokeroom is always full
of pleasant chaps You see the smokeroom on an English liner is made
like English law for men only and being made for men it is the most
comfortable place upon the ship It is my habit to make for the
smokeroom as soon as I decently can or even sooner there to lie upon
a leather couch feet up back propped against a cushion and smoke or
doze or read or talk or think about the endlessness of transatlantic
trips Only two things can drive me from the smokeroom one is the
smokeroom steward who closes up at night the other is my own sense of
shipboard duty toward family or friends Occasionally one has to go and
see how they are faring
How the ship rolls and lurches the moment that one rises from the
leather couch How cold and damp and windy is the deck how desolate the
ladies cabin when one comes from the snugness of the smokeroom Upon a
narrow seat just inside the cabin door an indelicate old person lies
eyes closed and jaws agape Across the room a book turned downward in
her lap sits the forlorn object of your fond solicitude Her eyes are
gazing straight ahead at nothing
Ah dear you say approaching with the best show of gaiety that you
can muster here you are eh I thought Id come and see if you wanted
me
Oh no
Did that canned pineapple disagree with you Im glad I didnt touch
it Well then Ill run in and see them auction off the pool You wont
mind Byby dear
You think that you want air Reeling to the wind swept deck you cling
unsteadily to an iron post at the fore part of the ship Your cap goes
flying overboard carried like an aeroplane upon the gale your cigar
is blown to shreds you feel the sting of cold salt spray upon your
face your eyeballs rock with the great bow of the ship which rears
itself in air higher higher higher then smashes down upon the sea
throwing green hissing mountains off to either side only to rear and
smash again a million times
Yet some people say this is agreeable this senseless movement of a
ship this utter waste of time and energy But you know better You let
go of the post bolt down the deck dive into the smokeroom and fling
yourself again upon the leather couch As you touch it a magic calm
oerspreads the sea Then all is well until your sense of duty pricks
again
Illustration AH CONFIDENCES BESIDE A LIFEBOAT ON THE UPPER DECK
That the smokeroom is iniquitous I ownas iniquitous as a comfortable
club with nice dark wainscoting leather chairs and couches and
little bells to touch when good cigars and other things are wanted It
is therefore quite the nicest place on the whole ship
My deckwalking friends will not subscribe to this of course They call
my smokeroom views and habits anything but healthy and urge me to come
out upon the cold and slippery decks and get the chilly benefits of
being on the sea Alas there is but one benefit for me and that is
Europe I detest the sea I abhor it with an awful loathing It offends
alike my physical system and my sense of proportion It is too
sickeningly out of scale too hideously large
Do not fancy that I object to water as such In glasses in bathtubs
under bridges or trimmed with swans and waterlilies water is all well
enough But to put so much of it in one place is a wasteful vulgar
show
You see that I am telling you the truth about the sea I am not one to
sit upon the shore and write you poetry of the kind that is described
as rollicking about it What occupation could be more despicable than
that of making seasongs to mislead the public
The sea The sea The open sea
The blue the fresh the ever free
I never was on the dull tame shore
But I loved the great sea more and more
Do you grasp the ambiguity the subtle trickery of that last line What
does it really mean It means that Bryan W Procter who wrote it had
to be upon the shore to love the sea that the more he was upon the
shore the more he loved the sea and that the more he was upon the sea
the more he loved the shore In other words he loathed the sea as I
do And I am told he hardly left his native England for dread of the
Channel trip
As for Coleridge Cunningham and Campbell it is only too evident that
they wrote seasongs in vain celebration of their own initials Byron
and Wallace Irwin were probably bribed by the transatlantic steamship
companies and the Navy Department
And not one of them is a realist There have been two realists who have
written poetry of the sea One is Shakespeare who wrote Now would I
give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground The other
is James Montgomery Flagg who in his All in the Same Boat exposes the
sea down to its very depths The sea treated him abominably He
retaliated by throwing a book If the sea had any sense of shame it
would dry up and so would certain of the passengers upon it The
Cheerful One for instance
He sees you are dozing he knows you are ill
But he will sidle up just to say
As he crowds his gay person on half of your chair
Well hows the boy feeling today
Dont ever fancy that the Cheerful One among the passengers inquires
thus because he cares a whit He only wishes to emphasise his own
immunity from mal de mer and blow the smoke of his disgusting pipe
into your face Neither his stomach nor his intellect is sensitive He
has a monologue on seasickness it is all nonsense imagination It
denotes weakness not so much of the stomach as of the mentality the
will the character And besides you dont call this rough do you
You ought to have crossed with him in the old Nausia in eightynine
Fourteen days and the racks never off the table Only two other
passengers at meals anddont you feel it comingthe captain said it
was thebut you fill in the rest Ah if the Nausia had only sunk
with all on board
Illustration QUITE THE NICEST PLACE ON THE WHOLE SHIP IS THE
SMOKEROOM
When the voyage is smooth and the Cheerful One is denied the joy of
making seasick folk feel sicker he is disappointed but not idle for
he may still extort confessions from untravelled persons You know
him the solid redfaced man who dresses for dinner and sits at the
head of the table eating fried things loud and long when it is rough He
wears travel as though it were the Order of the Garter and tells you
between mouthfuls about all the ships that sail the seas No sir
Pardon me The table on this ship cannot compare with that of the old
Gorgic The Potterdams the only ship for table outside the
RitzCarlton boats though Captain Van der Planks a personal friend of
mine He knows what eating is sir Still I like the small boatsno
elevators gymnasiums and swimmingpools for me I like to know Im at
sea sir And all the time hes casting round for a victim who has
never been across before
You see there is something very ignominious in making a first
transatlantic trip No one should ever do it Everybody should begin
with the second or third trip Yet I remember a little Kansas City
lawyer I met on the New Amsterdam who didnt seem to be ashamed of
owning up He was baldheaded and despite the twinkling eyes behind his
spectacles solemnlooking His bald head felt a draught from an open
porthole during dinner on the first night out and it was when he asked
the waiter to close the window that the seasoned traveller as
they love to call themselves snapped up his cue Turning in his seat
and bringing his wide white shirtfront to bear full upon his victim he
raised a foghorn voice and asked the dreaded question
Ever been abroad before
We all squirmed with sympathy for the little man
No he replied looking up with a mild innocent expression
The shirtfront bulged the watery blue eyes looked up and down the
table for attention then
That so with a patronising air of feigned surprise Ive been
over thirtyfour times
Ever been in Omaha returned the lawyer blandly
Whyno
That so replied the lawyer with fine mimetic quality I go there
every week
Oh Innocents as you set out on your first trip abroad dont let
yourself be bullied by the boastful Call the steward a waiter call the
porthole a window call the promenade deck the front porch but call
oh call the transatlantic bully down Be ready for him the instant he
bawls that hes a member of the Travellers Club For the rest be the
ingenuous traveller if you like Be the man who has a mania for sitting
at the captains table the man who goes abroad to get a lot of labels
on his suitcase the man who buys a set on Broadway for two dollars
and sticks them on at home the man who howls when bands play Dixie
the man who wears the Stars and Stripes upon his hat the man who
gambles with the racylooking stranger underneath the warning smokeroom
sign and stops payment on the cheque by cable be personally
conducted be anything you like but if you ever get to patronising
people who are seasick if you ever get to being proud of having
crossed the ocean oftener than little Kansas City lawyers do this
Wait until the ship is settled for the night go out on the dark deck
step over to the rail and place the left hand lightly but firmly upon
it Then give an upward and outward jump raising the feet and legs to
the right in such manner as to permit them to pass freely over the
obstruction When they are well over remove the left hand from the
rail This is called vaulting The water may be cold but you wont mind
it very long And one word more Dont gurgle somebody might hear you
and stupidly spoil all by crying out Man overboard
If you decide to end it allwhich I believe is the expression
adopted by the best authoritiesthere is one humane suggestion I would
make End it before the ships concert Theres absolutely no use in
just living on and saying you wont go to the concert for that is just
what everybody else says yet everybody always goes There is a horrible
fascination about a ships concert something hypnotic that draws you
very much against your word and will I always think of it as a sort of
awful antidote that is given to the passengers to counteract the poison
of the steady boredom of the ship It is an event in the voyage just as
the appendicitis operation is an event in life And as the only people
who enjoy the appendicitis operation are the doctors the only people
who go gaily to the concert are those who go there to perform
The chairman for instance enjoys it very much He is a peer a member
of Parliament or the United States consul at Shepherds Bush and he
begins his speech by stating that the proceeds of the entertainment will
be equally divided between the Seamens Funds of New York and Liverpool
or somewhere else It is then necessary to explain what seamen are They
are these brave watchful fellows who have our lives in their hands
At this the chairman looks at the table stewards who stand about the
walls with their napkins and their middleclass grins brave watchful
fellows trying to look as if they really held our lives and not our
dinners in their hands
His duty to the Seamens Funds accomplished the chairman passes on to
other things Just what they are depends upon his nationality If he be
a British chairman his speech will be composed of throaty sounds
coughs clearings of the throat and mumblings through which the quick
ear of the auditor may catch the following remarks
As a matter of fact
Dont you know
I mean to say
Now and then there comes a British chairman with a wide oratorical
scope In his case these additional expressions will occur
After all now
You Americans
Eh what
With the American chairman it is different You understand his speech
and only wish you didnt After telling you that it is a great
pleasure he continues through allusions to
This international occasion
Our English cousins
Hands across the sea
Blood is thicker than water
Then comes a humourous story about an Englishman an American and an
Irishman at which the English passengers laugh having a tradition
that you Yankees are such droll chaps The chairman now switches
quickly from the quasiridiculous to the pseudosublime and works up to
his big moment which has for its climax the tablepounding statement
that the AngloSaxon race must and shall predominate
This is violently applauded by everybody but a Frenchman who writhes
horribly and Fletcherises his handkerchief
Illustration YOUR CAP GOES FLYING OVERBOARD YOUR CIGAR IS BLOWN TO
SHREDS
When the applause is over the entertainment begins with the
announcement that the OperaSinger and the Polish Pianist are unable to
appear owing to indispositionwhich really means an ingrowing
disposition not to do so They have however sent liberal donations
to the Fund We then find that we are nevertheless so fortunate as to
have with us tonight a young actor The Actor gives a seriocomic
recitation But his encore is his piece de resistance It proves to
be a vivid verse about marine disaster a form of selection obviously
suited to the occasion Where except at a ships concert can one get
the full value of such lines as
We are lost the captain shouted
As he staggered down the stair
By turning ones head only slightly one can actually see the stair all
ready for the captain Suppose we hit a derelict at this very moment We
might see the whole thing acted out
After this recitation some one tries to play on the piano In the middle
of the piece the ship gives an obliging lurch but to no purpose for
though the performer slips off the stool striking with his hands
something that sounds like the lost chord and with his body two ladies
who are waiting for their turn he is picked up and put back on the
stool to finish
When he has done so his rescuers spring blithely forward one playing
the accompaniment very badly while the other renders Araby Araby is
always sung at a ships concert Likewise a young Englishman invariably
sings The Powder Monkey
The English have peculiar views on singing Mere matters of voice and
ear make not the slightest difference to them It is like going to war
or playing on the flute one cant refuse I mean to say if one is
asked Eh what The only man in England who has a right to say he
cannot sing is one who is literally dumb and as he cannot say it it is
never said And so you see Britannia Rules the Wave and all that sort
of thing
At the end of the concert God Save the King strikes up and everybody
rises and lifts such voice as he has in song the American passengers
labouring under a conviction that the words begin My country tis of
thee until the Britons drown them out
But we have our turn for The StarSpangled Banner is played
immediately after The words of this excellent song as Mr Rupert
Hughes has pointed out begin with something of this sort
Oh say can you see by the dawns early light
How the la tata ta and the tata ta tumtum
So we proceed until we reach the spirited baaanner yeet waave
and the shrieking climax of the laandofthefreeeee The
object of the game is not to let the British find out that we dont know
the words
On German ships particularly those in the Mediterranean service the
gay occasion of the voyage will be the Captains Dinner a function
which doubtless draws its name from the fact that the captain is
invariably absent from the table But if the captain doesnt come
everybody else does and there is more dress than usual and there are
lights inside the ices After dinner the deck is illuminated with
coloured electric bulbs the band plays and the people trip the light
fantastic toe as country papers put it On German liners its not
always light but it is frequently fantastic
There are two great events that occur on this occasion Some young men
from the section which is the backbone of our countryif not its
fashion centreappear on deck in dinnercoats and derby hats They have
read somewhere a fashion note stating that the derby or bowler hat is
the one headpiece de rigueur with the Tuxedo or dinner suit and they
mean to be comme il faut upon their trip abroad or bust The other
great event is the ships belle in her pink chiffon It makes you almost
wish you were a dancingman to see her But there are dancingmen
enoughamong them the ships doctor He leads her in the mazes of the
waltz and while dancing is given an ansthetic in shape of a
languishing glance or two Before he comes to his partner has performed
a minor operation on himthe amputation of a button
You overhear her on the tender as you leave the ship next day Oh
