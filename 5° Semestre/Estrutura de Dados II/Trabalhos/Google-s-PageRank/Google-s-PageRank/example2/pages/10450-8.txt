IDYLLS OF THE KING OF PRUSSIA
A FRAGMENT
So spake Sir GERARD USA and ceased
Then answered WILLIAM talking through his hat
When first the heathen rose against our realm
That haunt of peace where all day long occurred
The cooing of innumerable doves
I hailed my knighthood where I sat in hall
At high Potsdam the Palace and they came
And all the rafters rang with rousing Hochs
So to my feet they drew and kissed my boots
And laid their maily fists in mine and sware
To reverence their Kaiser as their God
And vice versa to uphold the Faith
Approved by me as Champion of the Church
To ride abroad redressing Belgiums wrongs
To honour treaties like a virgins troth
To serve as model in the nations eyes
Of strength with sweetness wed to hack their way
Without superfluous violence to spare
The best cathedrals lest my heart should bleed
Nor butcher babes and women or at least
No more than needfulin a word behave
Like Prussian officers the flower of men
I bade them take ensample from their Lord
Of perfect manners wearing on their helms
The bouquet of a blameless Junkerhood
And be a law of culture to themselves
Though other laws not made in Germany
Should perish being scrapped For so I deemed
That this our Order of the Table Round
Should mould its Christian pattern on the spheres
Itself unchanged amid a world newmade
And men should say in that fair aftertime
The old Order sticketh yielding place to none
So be Whereat that other held his peace
Seeming for courtesy to yield assent
But as within the lists at Camelot
Some temporary knight mislays his seat
And falls and falling lets his morion loose
And lights upon his head and all the spot
Swells like a pumpkin and he hides the bulge
Beneath his gauntlet lest it cause remark
And curious commentso behind his hand
Sir GERARDs cheek that had his tongue inside
Swelled like a pumpkin
O S
THE STOCKING OF PRIVATE PARKS
As I came out on to the convalescents verandah my brother James looked
up from his paper
Did I ever tell you about a certain Private Parks he asked He was
with me in Flanders in the early days He came out with a draft and
lasted about two months Rather a curious type Very superstitious If a
shell narrowly missed him he must have a small piece to put in his
pocket If while standing on a duckboard he happened to be immune while
his pals were being knocked out he would carry it about with him all day
if possible On one occasion he was very nearly shot for
insubordination because he would go out into Nomansland after a
flower which he thought would help him
Not that his superstition was purely selfish Once when he had had two
particularly close shaves during the day he insisted upon sleeping
outside the barn where we were billeted Im absolutely certain to have
a third close shave he said and if Im in the billet someone will
get it
The Corporal let him lie down in the farmyard but a little later he
crept up the road about fifty yards to make things more certain
And I suppose the barn was hit and he escaped I put in feeling that
I had heard this story before
You dont know Private Parks said James About two oclock in the
morning a shell fell on the road not ten yards from him Bits of it must
have made a pattern all round him but not one hit him and when hed
picked himself out of the ditch he went back to the billet knowing all
was then safe
Then one day when we were in the front line there came up with the mail
a parcel for Private Parks I was near when he opened it When he saw
the contents he gave a sigh and a curious resigned expression came over
his face
Whats she sent you I asked
Its from my old aunt Sir he said Its a stocking Only one
Yes he said with great solemnity The other ones been pinched I
asked No Sir The parcels not been opened It simply means that I
shall lose a leg today he added He wasnt panicked at all But as
to reassuring him I might as well have argued with a tank
Wed had a very quiet time but that evening the Hun put over a pretty
stiff bombardment We stood to but we all thought it was only a little
extra evening hate except Private Parks He kept saying Theyre
coming across till we told him not to get the wind up But he hadnt
got the wind up Only he knew they were coming
And they did come Just after it was dark they made a biggish raid and
got into our front trench a little to our right We started bombing
inwards but the slope of the ground was awkward and they seemed to be
having the best of the fun
Then Parks jumped up on to the parapet with a pail of bombs and ran
along He fairly got among them and by the time he was hit in the right
leg they were mostly casualties or prisoners I saw him on the stretcher
going back He was in some pain but he smiled and said One stocking
will be enough now Sir
Very extraordinary I began but James stopped me
I havent finished he said When about three months later I went
down to Southmouth Convalescent Camp almost the first man I saw was
Private Parks He was still on crutches but he had two legs I
greeted him and then I couldnt resist saying What about the
stocking
Ill tell you Sir he said For a week after I was wounded it was a
toss up whether they took the leg off or not Then a parcel arrived for
me It was the other stocking My aunt had discovered that she had left
it out That evening the surgeon decided that they need not amputate I
knew they wouldnt of course as soon as I received the parcel
James had really finished this time and after a moments reflection I
said I wonder if thats true
Do you flatter me he asked
I dont know about that Not with intent I said though it would
really be more to your credit if youd made it up
As a matter of fact said James I did make it up It was suggested
to me by the heading to a letter in this paperThe Stocking of Private
Parks though that appears to be upon quite a different subject
Something agricultural I gather
By a comparison of the wet and dry bulb registrations the dew
point and the humility of the atmosphere is determined

IM SURE SIR YOUR STAY HERE IS DOING YOU GOOD WHY YOURE TWICE THE
GENTLEMAN YOU WERE WHEN YOU CAME
A LETTER FROM NEW YORK
Dear We got here safely with the usual submarine scares en
route but apparently no real danger Vessels going westward from
England are not much the Uboats concern nor are the Us I guess
particularly keen on wasting torpedoes on passenger ships What they
want to sink is the goods
Anyway we got here safely It is all very wonderful and novel and the
interest in the War is unmistakable but what I want to tell you about
is an experience that I have had in the house of one of the leading
picture collectors hereand the art treasures of America are gradually
but surely becoming terrific If some measure is not passed to prevent
export England will soon have nothing left except in the public
galleries Of course for a while America cant be so rich as if she
had not come into the War but she will be richer than we can ever be
for a good many years while the steel people who make the implements of
destruction at Bethlehem will be richest of all What my man makes I
cannot say but he is a king of sorts even if not actually a Bethlehem
boss and the Medici are not in it I have introductions to all the most
famous collectors but hearing of his splendours I went to him first
Well I sent on my credentials and was invited to call and inspect the
Plutocrats walls You never saw anything like them And he refers to
his collection only as a modest nucleus He has agents all over the
world to discover when the possessors of certain unique works are
nearing the rocks Then he offers to buy As his wealth is unlimited
and sooner or later all the nobility and gentry of England France
Italy and Russia will be in Queer Street his collection cannot but grow
and become more and more amazing He even had the cheek to send the
Trustees of the National Gallery a blank cheque asking them to fill it
up as they wished whenever they were ready to part with TITIANS
Bacchus and Ariadne Though he calls himself a patriot directly the
War is done he will make overtures to Germany There is a Vermeer in
Berlin on which he has set his heart and another in Dresden
I could fill reams in telling you what he has But I confine myself to
one picture only which he keeps in a room by itself I am not so
foolish as to pretend to know anything but to my eyes this picture
was nothing whatever but the Louvres Monna Lisa
That being of course impossible What a wonderful copy I said
You may indeed say so replied my host
I looked at it more closely even applying a pocket magnifyingglass
There was not a contemporary duplicate I inquired Could LEONARDO
have painted two
The Chowder King or whatever he is called smiled inscrutably No
doubt he could he said But perhaps he continued you have not
seen the Louvre picture since it was put back after the theft
Not to examine it closely I replied
He laughed softly and led the way to the door
Now what I want to know is is it possible that
This terrible thought has been haunting me day and night
I have asked many Americans to tell me about this collector and his
methods but I can get no exact information But it seems to be agreed
that he would stick at nothing to get a coveted work beneath his roof
If I have many more such shocks as he gave me I shall give up paint
altogether and specialise in photography or the threecolour process
Anyway it is Gods own country and I will tell you my further
adventures as I have them Tomorrow I am to attend a reception at the
White House to hear ELLA WHEELER WILCOX recite an Ode at the President

HYMN FOR HIGH PLACES
In darkened days of strife and fear
When far from home and hold
I do essay my soul to cheer
As did wise men of old
When folk do go in doleful guise
And are for life afraid
I to the hills will lift mine eyes
From whence doth come mine aid
I shall my soul a temple make
Where hills stand up on high
Thither my sadness shall I take
And comfort there descry
For every good and noble mount
This message doth extend
That evil men must render count
And evil days must end
For sooth it is a kingly sight
To see Gods mountain tall
That vanquisheth each lesser height
As great hearts vanquish small
Stand up stand up ye holy hills
As saints and seraphs do
That ye may bear these present ills
And lead men safely through
Let high and low repair and go
To where great hills endure
Let strong and weak be there to seek
Their comfort and their cure
And for all hills in fair array
Now thanks and blessings give
And bearing healthful hearts away
Home go and stoutly live

O gallant youths of Colwyn Bay
With what unmitigated rapture
Did I peruse but yesterday
The story of your famous capture
Alone ye did it or at least
Twas next to being singlehanded
No other helped to catch the beast
No strength but yours the monster landed
But now comes in the cold Town Clerk
Who has meticulously stated
It was a dogfishnot a shark
In size much overestimated
So ye intrepid striplings who
Made all your schoolfellows feel humble
Are mulcted of your honours due
By an officious Cambrian Bumble
But though your generous hearts be sore
Take comfort all the true patricians
Of intellect have been at war
With frigid rigid statisticians
I too have suffered from the rule
Of sceptics icily pedantic
Who blighted ere I went to school
My dreams when they were most romantic
For once when swinging on a gate
With hands that doubtless daubed it jammily
I saw a lion sure as fate
And fled indoors to tell the family
But when I told them all agog
My aunt a lean and acid spinster
Snapped out the doctors yellow dog
And nothing I could say convinced her
Twas ever thus from childhoods hour
Since HOMER HANNIBAL or STRONGBOW

Are charged with drawing of the long bow
Great travellersnot your GRANTS or SPEKES

Or scaled imaginary peaks
Upon the backs of pink chinchillas
Or in some languorous lagoon

Or in the Mountains of the Moon
Saw rocs athwart the zenith hurtle
All all have had their fame aspersed
By rude Town Clerks or senior wranglers
But those who have been treated worst
Are the heroic tribe of anglers
THE NEW GOLF
Lets go and play the new golf said James
Now as I understand it there are four kinds of golf First the ordinary
golf as played by all people who are not quite right in their heads
second the ideal golf to be played by me but not till I get to
heaven on a bowlinggreen with a croquetmallet the holes being
sixtysix feet apart and both cuttingin and goingthrough strictly
prohibited third the absurd golf as played by James in prewar days
on his private ninehole course and fourth it seemed the new golf
such as James would be liable to create during a recovery from
shellshock
James is one of those people who possessing what Country Life would
call one of the lesser countryhouses of England has an indeterminate
bit of ground beyond the garden called according to choice of costume
the rockgarden the homefarm the grouse moor or no rubbish
may be shot here James calls his own particular nettlebed or slag
heap the golfcourse
When anyone went to stay with James he was adjured to
bringyourgolfclubsoldmanasIcangive
youabitofagameonmyowncourseonlyanineholeoneyou
understand And when James wentfar more willinglyto stay opposite
the Germans until an interesting visit was shortcircuited by
shellshock he showed himself so wonderfully at home in dugouts and
shellholes and minecraters so completely undisturbed by the weariful
lack of any green on the course over which his battalion was playing
that he rose from SecondLieutenant to Lieutenant with almost unheardof
celerity in the space of two years and nine months And now the absurd
figureofeight ninehole course the third hole of which was also the
seventh and the first the ninth had been complicated into a war
kitchengarden and James bored with ordinary difficulties and
discomforts had evolved the new golf
Come on said he burning with the zeal of a martyrburner Ill show
you the ground
Cant I see it by standing up in the hammock I protested
We approached the dark demesne which was now pretty decently clothed
with potatoes artichokes rhubarb raspberrycanes marrows and even
cucumberframes In the midst was a large open cask which filled itself
by a pipe from a former sixinch waterhazard Here James began to
propound the mysteries
The game he said is a mixture of the old golf tiddleywinks ludo
and the race game
Not spillikins I protested A game I rather fancy myself at
For your information please continued James in his kindliest
military manner I may remark that a mashie is the club mostly
usedexcept when it is necessary to keep low between say two clumps
