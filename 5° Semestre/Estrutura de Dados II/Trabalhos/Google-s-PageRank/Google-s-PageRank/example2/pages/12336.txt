BROWN WOLF
She had delayed because of the dewwet grass in order to put on her
overshoes and when she emerged from the house found her waiting husband
absorbed in the wonder of a bursting almondbud She sent a questing
glance across the tall grass and in and out among the orchard trees
Wheres Wolf she asked
He was here a moment ago Walt Irvine drew himself away with a jerk
from the metaphysics and poetry of the organic miracle of blossom and
surveyed the landscape He was running a rabbit the last I saw of him
Wolf Wolf Here Wolf she called as they left the clearing and took
the trail that led down through the waxenbelled manzanita jungle to
the county road
Irvine thrust between his lips the little finger of each hand and lent
to her efforts a shrill whistling
She covered her ears hastily and made a wry grimace
My for a poet delicately attuned and all the rest of it you can make
unlovely noises My eardrums are pierced You outwhistle
Orpheus
I was about to say a streetarab she concluded severely
Poesy does not prevent one from being practicalat least it doesnt
prevent me Mine is no futility of genius that cant sell gems to the
magazines
He assumed a mock extravagance and went on
I am no attic singer no ballroom warbler And why Because I am
practical Mine is no squalor of song that cannot transmute itself with
proper exchange value into a flowercrowned cottage a sweet
mountainmeadow a grove of redwoods an orchard of thirtyseven trees
one long row of blackberries and two short rows of strawberries to say
nothing of a quarter of a mile of gurgling brook
Oh that all your songtransmutations were as successful she laughed
Name one that wasnt
Those two beautiful sonnets that you transmuted into the cow that was
accounted the worst milker in the township
She was beautiful he began
But she didnt give milk Madge interrupted
But she was beautiful now wasnt she he insisted
And heres where beauty and utility fall out was her reply And
theres the Wolf
From the thicketcovered hillside came a crashing of underbrush and
then forty feet above them on the edge of the sheer wall of rock
appeared a wolfs head and shoulders His braced forepaws dislodged a
pebble and with sharppricked ears and peering eyes he watched the fall
of the pebble till it struck at their feet Then he transferred his gaze
and with open mouth laughed down at them
You Wolf you and You blessed Wolf the man and woman called out to
him The ears flattened back and down at the sound and the head seemed
to snuggle under the caress of an invisible hand
They watched him scramble backward into the thicket then proceeded on
their way Several minutes later rounding a turn in the trail where the
descent was less precipitous he joined them in the midst of a miniature
avalanche of pebbles and loose soil He was not demonstrative A pat and
a rub around the ears from the man and a more prolonged caressing from
the woman and he was away down the trail in front of them gliding
effortlessly over the ground in true wolf fashion
In build and coat and brush he was a huge timberwolf but the lie was
given to his wolfhood by his color and marking There the dog
unmistakably advertised itself No wolf was ever colored like him He
was brown deep brown redbrown an orgy of browns Back and shoulders
were a warm brown that paled on the sides and underneath to a yellow
that was dingy because of the brown that lingered in it The white of
the throat and paws and the spots over the eyes was dirty because of the
persistent and ineradicable brown while the eyes themselves were twin
topazes golden and brown
The man and woman loved the dog very much perhaps this was because it
had been such a task to win his love It had been no easy matter when he
first drifted in mysteriously out of nowhere to their little mountain
cottage Footsore and famished he had killed a rabbit under their very
noses and under their very windows and then crawled away and slept by
the spring at the foot of the blackberry bushes When Walt Irvine went
down to inspect the intruder he was snarled at for his pains and Madge
likewise was snarled at when she went down to present as a
peaceoffering a large pan of bread and milk
A most unsociable dog he proved to be resenting all their advances
refusing to let them lay hands on him menacing them with bared fangs
and bristling hair Nevertheless he remained sleeping and resting by
the spring and eating the food they gave him after they set it down at
a safe distance and retreated His wretched physical condition explained
why he lingered and when he had recuperated after several days
sojourn he disappeared
And this would have been the end of him so far as Irvine and his wife
were concerned had not Irvine at that particular time been called away
into the northern part of the state Biding along on the train near to
the line between California and Oregon he chanced to look out of the
window and saw his unsociable guest sliding along the wagon road brown
and wolfish tired yet tireless dustcovered and soiled with two
hundred miles of travel
Now Irvine was a man of impulse a poet He got off the train at the
next station bought a piece of meat at a butcher shop and captured the
vagrant on the outskirts of the town The return trip was made in the
baggage car and so Wolf came a second time to the mountain cottage
Here he was tied up for a week and made love to by the man and woman
But it was very circumspect lovemaking Remote and alien as a traveller
from another planet he snarled down their softspoken lovewords He
never barked In all the time they had him he was never known to bark
To win him became a problem Irvine liked problems He had a metal plate
made on which was stamped Return to Walt Irvine Glen Ellen Sonoma
County California This was riveted to a collar and strapped about the
dogs neck Then he was turned loose and promptly He disappeared A
day later came a telegram from Mendocino County In twenty hours he had
made over a hundred miles to the north and was still going when
captured
He came back by Wells Fargo Express was tied up three days and was
loosed on the fourth and lost This time he gained southern Oregon
before he was caught and returned Always as soon as he received his
liberty he fled away and always he fled north He was possessed of an
obsession that drove him north The homing instinct Irvine called it
after he had expended the selling price of a sonnet in getting the
animal back from northern Oregon
Another time the brown wanderer succeeded in traversing half the length
of California all of Oregon and most of Washington before he was
picked up and returned Collect A remarkable thing was the speed with
which he traveled Fed up and rested as soon as he was loosed he
devoted all his energy to getting over the ground On the first days
run he was known to cover as high as a hundred and fifty miles and
after that he would average a hundred miles a day until caught He
always arrived back lean and hungry and savage and always departed
fresh and vigorous cleaving his way northward in response to some
prompting of his being that no one could understand
But at last after a futile year of flight he accepted the inevitable
and elected to remain at the cottage where first he had killed the
rabbit and slept by the spring Even after that a long time elapsed
before the man and woman succeeded in patting him It was a great
victory for they alone were allowed to put hands on him He was
fastidiously exclusive and no guest at the cottage ever succeeded in
making up to him A low growl greeted such approach if any one had the
hardihood to come nearer the lips lifted the naked fangs appeared and
the growl became a snarla snarl so terrible and malignant that it awed
the stoutest of them as it likewise awed the farmers dogs that knew
ordinary dog snarling but had never seen wolf snarling before
He was without antecedents His history began with Walt and Madge He
had come up from the south but never a clew did they get of the owner
from whom he had evidently fled Mrs Johnson their nearest neighbor
and the one who supplied them with milk proclaimed him a Klondike dog
Her brother was burrowing for frozen paystreaks in that far country
and so she constituted herself an authority on the subject
But they did not dispute her There were the tips of Wolfs ears
obviously so severely frozen at some time that they would never quite
heal again Besides he looked like the photographs of the Alaskan dogs
they saw published in magazines and newspapers They often speculated
over his past and tried to conjure up from what they had read and
heard what his northland life had been That the northland still drew
him they knew for at night they sometimes heard him crying softly and
when the north wind blew and the bite of frost was in the air a great
restlessness would come upon him and he would lift a mournful lament
which they knew to be the long wolfhowl Yet he never barked No
provocation was great enough to draw from him that canine cry
Long discussion they had during the time of winning him as to whose
dog he was Each claimed him and each proclaimed loudly any expression
of affection made by him But the man had the better of it at first
chiefly because he was a man It was patent that Wolf had had no
experience with women He did not understand women Madges skirts were
something he never quite accepted The swish of them was enough to set
him abristle with suspicion and on a windy day she could not approach
him at all
On the other hand it was Madge who fed him also it was she who ruled
the kitchen and it was by her favor and her favor alone that he was
permitted to come within that sacred precinct It was because of these
things that she bade fair to overcome the handicap of her garments Then
it was that Walt put forth special effort making it a practice to have
Wolf lie at his feet while he wrote and between petting and talking
losing much time from his work Walt won in the end and his victory was
most probably due to the fact that he was a man though Madge averred
that they would have had another quarter of a mile of gurgling brook
and at least two west winds sighing through their redwoods had Walt
properly devoted his energies to songtransmutation and left Wolf alone
to exercise a natural taste and an unbiased judgment
Its about time I heard from those triolets Walt said after a
silence of five minutes during which they had swung steadily down the
trail Therell be a check at the post office I know and well
transmute it into beautiful buckwheat flour a gallon of maple syrup
and a new pair of overshoes for you
And into beautiful milk from Mrs Johnsons beautiful cow Madge
added Tomorrows the first of the month you know
Walt scowled unconsciously then his face brightened and he clapped his
hand to his breast pocket
Never mind I have here a nice beautiful new cow the best milker in
California
When did you write it she demanded eagerly Then reproachfully And
you never showed it to me
I saved it to read to you on the way to the post office in a spot
remarkably like this one he answered indicating with a wave of his
hand a dry log on which to sit
A tiny stream flowed out of a dense fernbrake slipped down a
mossylipped stone and ran across the path at their feet From the
valley arose the mellow song of meadow larks while about them in and
out through sunshine and shadow fluttered great yellow butterflies
Up from below came another sound that broke in upon Walt reading softly
from his manuscript It was a crunching of heavy feet punctuated now
and again by the clattering of a displaced stone As Walt finished and
looked to his wife for approval a man came into view around the turn of
the trail He was bareheaded and sweaty With a handkerchief in one hand
he mopped his face while in the other hand he carried a new hat and a
wilted starched collar which he had removed from his neck He was a
wellbuilt man and his muscles seemed on the point of bursting out of
the painfully new and readymade black clothes he wore
Warm day Walt greeted him Walt believed in country democracy and
never missed an opportunity to practice it
The man paused and nodded
I guess I aint used much to the warm he vouchsafed half
apologetically Im more accustomed to zero weather
You dont find any of that in this country Walt laughed
Should say not the man answered An I aint here alookin for it
neither Im tryin to find my sister Mebbe you know where she lives
Her names Johnson Mrs William Johnson
Youre not her Klondike brother Madge cried her eyes bright with
interest about whom weve heard so much
Yesm thats me he answered modestly My names Miller Skiff
Miller I just thought Id sprise her
You are on the right track then Only youve come by the footpath
Madge stood up to direct him pointing up the canyon a quarter of a
mile You see that blasted redwood Take the little trail turning off
to the right Its the short cut to her house You cant miss it
Yesm thank you maam he said
He made tentative efforts to go but seemed awkwardly rooted to the
spot He was gazing at her with an open admiration of which he was quite
unconscious and which was drowning along with him in the rising sea
of embarrassment in which he floundered
Wed like to hear you tell about the Klondike Madge said Maynt we
come over some day while you are at your sisters Or better yet
wont you come over and have dinner with us
Yesm thank you maam he mumbled mechanically Then he caught
himself up and added I aint stoppin long I got to be pullin north
again I go out on tonights train You see Ive got a mail contract
with the government
When Madge had said that it was too bad he made another futile effort
to go But he could not take his eyes from her face He forgot his
embarrassment in his admiration and it was her turn to flush and feel
uncomfortable
It was at this juncture when Walt had just decided it was time for him
to be saying something to relieve the strain that Wolf who had been
away nosing through the brush trotted wolflike into view
Skiff Millers abstraction disappeared The pretty woman before him
passed out of his field of vision He had eyes only for the dog and a
great wonder came into his face
Well Ill be hanged he enunciated slowly and solemnly
He sat down ponderingly on the log leaving Madge standing At the sound
of his voice Wolfs ears had flattened down then his mouth had opened
in a laugh He trotted slowly up to the stranger and first smelled his
hands then licked them with his tongue
Skiff Miller patted the dogs head and slowly and solemnly repeated
Well Ill be hanged
Excuse me maam he said the next moment I was just sprised some
that was all
Were surprised too she answered lightly We never saw Wolf make up
to a stranger before
Is that what you call himWolf the man asked
Madge nodded But I cant understand his friendliness toward
youunless its because youre from the Klondike Hes a Klondike dog
you know
Yesm Miller said absently He lifted one of Wolfs forelegs and
examined the footpads pressing them and denting them with his thumb
Kind of soft he remarked He aint been on trail for a long time
I say Walt broke in it is remarkable the way he lets you handle
him
Skiff Miller arose no longer awkward with admiration of Madge and in
a sharp businesslike manner asked How long have you had him
But just then the dog squirming and rubbing against the newcomers
legs opened his mouth and barked It was an explosive bark brief and
joyous but a bark
Thats a new one on me Skiff Miller remarked
Walt and Madge stared at each other The miracle had happened Wolf had
barked
Its the first time he ever barked Madge said
First time I ever heard him too Miller volunteered
Madge smiled at him The man was evidently a humorist
Of course she said since you have only seen him for five minutes
Skiff Miller looked at her sharply seeking in her face the guile her
words had led him to suspect
I thought you understood he said slowly I thought youd tumbled to
it from his makin up to me Hes my dog His name aint Wolf Its
Brown
Oh Walt was Madges instinctive cry to her husband
Walt was on the defensive at once
How do you know hes your dog he demanded
Because he is was the reply
Mere assertion Walt said sharply
In his slow and pondering way Skiff Miller looked at him then asked
with a nod of his head toward Madge
How dyou know shes your wife You just say Because she is and
Ill say its mere assertion The dogs mine I bred m an raised m
an I guess I ought to know Look here Ill prove it to you
Skiff Miller turned to the dog Brown His voice rang out sharply and
at the sound the dogs ears flattened down as to a caress Gee The
dog made a swinging turn to the right Now mushon And the dog ceased
his swing abruptly and started straight ahead halting obediently at
command
I can do it with whistles Skiff Miller said proudly He was my lead
dog
But you are not going to take him away with you Madge asked
tremulously
The man nodded
Back into that awful Klondike world of suffering
He nodded and added Oh it aint so bad as all that Look at me
Pretty healthy specimen aint I
But the dogs The terrible hardship the heartbreaking toil the
starvation the frost Oh Ive read about it and I know
I nearly ate him once over on Little Fish River Miller volunteered
grimly If I hadnt got a moose that day was all that saved m
Id have died first Madge cried
Things is different down here Miller explained You dont have to
eat dogs You think different just about the time youre all in Youve
never been all in so you dont know anything about it
Thats the very point she argued warmly Dogs are not eaten in
California Why not leave him here He is happy Hell never want for
foodyou know that Hell never suffer from cold and hardship Here all
is softness and gentleness Neither the human nor nature is savage He
will never know a whiplash again And as for the weatherwhy it
never snows here
But its allfired hot in summer beggin your pardon Skiff Miller
laughed
But you do not answer Madge continued passionately What have you to
offer him in that northland life
Grub when Ive got it and thats most of the time came the answer
And the rest of the time
No grub
And the work
Yes plenty of work Miller blurted out impatiently Work without
end an famine an frost an all the rest of the miseriesthats
what hell get when he comes with me But he likes it He is used to it
He knows that life He was born to it an brought up to it An you
dont know anything about it You dont know what youre talking about
Thats where the dog belongs and thats where hell be happiest
The dog doesnt go Walt announced in a determined voice So there is
no need of further discussion
Whats that Skiff Miller demanded big brows lowering and an
obstinate flush of blood reddening his forehead
I said the dog doesnt go and that settles it I dont believe hes
your dog You may have seen him sometime You may even sometime have
driven him for his owner But his obeying the ordinary driving commands
of the Alaskan trail is no demonstration that he is yours Any dog in
Alaska would obey you as he obeyed Besides he is undoubtedly a
valuable dog as dogs go in Alaska and that is sufficient explanation
of your desire to get possession of him Anyway youve got to prove
property
Skiff Miller cool and collected the obstinate flush a trifle deeper on
his forehead his huge muscles bulging under the black cloth of his
coat carefully looked the poet up and down as though measuring the
strength of his slenderness
The Klondikers face took on a contemptuous expression as he said
finally I reckon theres nothin in sight to prevent me takin the dog
right here an now
Walts face reddened and the strikingmuscles of his arms and shoulders
seemed to stiffen and grow tense His wife fluttered apprehensively
into the breach
Maybe Mr Miller is right she said I am afraid that he is Wolf
does seem to know him and certainly he answers to the name of Brown
He made friends with him instantly and you know thats something he
never did with anybody before Besides look at the way he barked He
was just bursting with joy Joy over what Without doubt at finding Mr
Miller
Walts strikingmuscles relaxed and his shoulders seemed to droop with
hopelessness
I guess youre right Madge he said Wolf isnt Wolf but Brown and
he must belong to Mr Miller
Perhaps Mr Miller will sell him she suggested We can buy him
Skiff Miller shook his head no longer belligerent but kindly quick to
be generous in response to generousness
I had five dogs he said casting about for the easiest way to temper
his refusal He was the leader They was the crack team of Alaska
Nothin could touch em In 1898 I refused five thousand dollars for the
bunch Dogs was high then anyway but that wasnt what made the fancy
price It was the team itself Brown was the best in the team That
winter I refused twelve hundred for m I didnt sell m then an I
aint asellin m now Besides I think a mighty lot of that dog Ive
been lookin for m for three years It made me fair sick when I found
hed been stolenot the value of him but thewell I liked m so
thats all I couldnt believe my eyes when I seen m just now I
thought I was dreamin It was too good to be true Why I was his
nurse I put m to bed snug every night His mother died and I brought
m up on condensed milk at two dollars a can when I couldnt afford it
in my own coffee He never knew any mother but me He used to suck my
finger regular the darn little pupthat finger right there
And Skiff Miller too overwrought for speech held up a forefinger for
them to see
That very finger he managed to articulate as though it somehow
clinched the proof of ownership and the bond of affection
He was still gazing at his extended finger when Madge began to speak
But the dog she said You havent considered the dog
Skiff Miller looked puzzled
Have you thought about him she asked
Dont know what youre drivin at was the response
Maybe the dog has some choice in the matter Madge went on Maybe he
has his likes and desires You have not considered him You give him no
choice It has never entered your mind that possibly he might prefer
California to Alaska You consider only what you like You do with him
as you would with a sack of potatoes or a bale of hay
This was a new way of looking at it and Miller was visibly impressed as
he debated it in his mind Madge took advantage of his indecision
If you really love him what would be happiness to him would be your
happiness also she urged
Skiff Miller continued to debate with himself and Madge stole a glance
of exultation to her husband who looked back warm approval
What do you think the Klondiker suddenly demanded
It was her turn to be puzzled What do you mean she asked
Dye think hed sooner stay in California
She nodded her head with positiveness I am sure of it
Skiff Miller again debated with himself though this time aloud at the
same time running his gaze in a judicial way over the mooted animal
He was a good worker Hes done a heap of work for me He never loafed
on me an he was a joedandy at hammerin a raw team into shape Hes
got a head on him He can do everything but talk He knows what you say
to him Look at m now He knows were talkin about him
The dog was lying at Skiff Millers feet head close down on paws ears
erect and listening and eyes that were quick and eager to follow the
sound of speech as it fell from the lips of first one and then the
other
An theres a lot of work in m yet Hes good for years to come An I
do like him
Once or twice after that Skiff Miller opened his mouth and closed it
again without speaking Finally he said
Ill tell you what Ill do Your remarks maam has some weight in
them The dogs worked hard and maybe hes earned a soft berth an has
got a right to choose Anyway well leave it up to him Whatever he
says goes You people stay right here settin down Ill say goodby
and walk off casuallike If he wants to stay he can stay If he wants
to come with me let m come I wont call m to come an dont you call
m to come back
He looked with sudden suspicion at Madge and added Only you must play
fair No persuadin after my back is turned
Well play fair Madge began but Skiff Miller broke in on her
assurances
I know the ways of women he announced Their hearts is soft When
their hearts is touched theyre likely to stack the cards look at the
bottom of the deck an liebeggin your pardon maam Im only
discoursin about women in general
I dont know how to thank you Madge quavered
I dont see as youve got any call to thank me he replied Brown
aint decided yet Now you wont mind if I go away slow Its no moren
fair seein Ill be out of sight inside a hundred yards
Madge agreed and added And I promise you faithfully that we wont do
anything to influence him
Well then I might as well he gettin along Skiff Miller said in the
ordinary tones of one departing
At this change in his voice Wolf lifted his head quickly and still
more quickly got to his feet when the man and woman shook hands He
sprang up on his hind legs resting his fore paws on her hip and at the
same time licking Skiff Millers hand When the latter shook hands with
Walt Wolf repeated his act resting his weight on Walt and licking both
mens hands
It aint no picnic I can tell you that were the Klondikers last
words as he turned and went slowly up the trail
For the distance of twenty feet Wolf watched him go himself all
eagerness and expectancy as though waiting for the man to turn and
retrace his steps Then with a quick low whine Wolf sprang after him
overtook him caught his hand between his teeth with reluctant
tenderness and strove gently to make him pause
Failing in this Wolf raced back to where Walt Irvine sat catching his
coat sleeve in his teeth and trying vainly to drag him after the
retreating man
Wolfs perturbation began to wax He desired ubiquity He wanted to be
in two places at the same time with the old master and the new and
steadily the distance between them was increasing He sprang about
excitedly making short nervous leaps and twists now toward one now
toward the other in painful indecision not knowing his own mind
desiring both and unable to choose uttering quick sharp whines and
beginning to pant
He sat down abruptly on his haunches thrusting his nose upward the
mouth opening and closing with jerking movements each time opening
wider These jerking movements were in unison with the recurrent spasms
that attacked the throat each spasm severer and more intense than the
preceding one And in accord with jerks and spasms the larynx began to
vibrate at first silently accompanied by the rush of air expelled from
the lungs then sounding a low deep note the lowest in the register of
the human ear All this was the nervous and muscular preliminary to
howling
But just as the howl was on the verge of bursting from the full throat
the wideopened mouth was closed the paroxysms ceased and he looked
long and steadily at the retreating man Suddenly Wolf turned his head
and over his shoulder just as steadily regarded Walt The appeal was
unanswered Not a word nor a sign did the dog receive no suggestion and
no clew as to what his conduct should be
A glance ahead to where the old master was nearing the curve of the
trail excited him again He sprang to his feet with a whine and then
struck by a new idea turned his attention to Madge Hitherto he had
ignored her but now both masters failing him she alone was left He
went over to her and snuggled his head in her lap nudging her arm with
his nosean old trick of his when begging for favors He backed away
from her and began writhing and twisting playfully curvetting and
prancing half rearing and striking his forepaws to the earth
struggling with all his body from the wheedling eyes and flattening
ears to the wagging tail to express the thought that was in him and
that was denied him utterance
This too he soon abandoned He was depressed by the coldness of these
humans who had never been cold before No response could he draw from
them no help could he get They did not consider him They were as
dead
He turned and silently gazed after the old master Skiff Miller was
rounding the curve In a moment he would be gone from view Yet he never
