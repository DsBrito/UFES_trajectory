This little book is mainly compounded of papers which appeared part in
the Monthly Packet and part in the Magazine of the Home Reading
Union It will be seen therefore that it is not intended for those
whom Italians call aDantistsa but for students at an early stage of
their studies To the former class there will be nothing in the book
that is not already familiarexcept where they happen to find mistakes
from which in so extensive a field for blundering as Dante affords I
cannot hope to have kept it free In the domain of history alone fresh
facts are constantly rewarding the indefatigable research of German and
Italian scholarsa research of which only the most highly specialised
specialist can possibly keep abreast Even since the following pages
were for the most part in print we have had Professor Villarias Two
Centuries of Florentine History correcting in many particulars the
chroniclers on whom the Dante student has been wont to rely This book
should most emphatically be added to those named in the appendix as
essential to the study of our author
In connection with some of the remarks in the opening chapter Professor
Butcheras Essay on The Dawn of Romanticism in Greek Poetry should be
noticed I do not think that the accomplished authoras view is
incompatible with mine though I admit that I had not taken much account
of the Greek writers whom we call apostclassicala But it is to be
noted as bearing on the question raised in the second footnote on p 9
that most or all of the writers whom he cites were either Asiatics or
nearly touched by Asiatic influences
I have made some attempt to deal in a concise way with two subjects
which have not I think hitherto been handled in English books on
Dante other than translations One of these is the development of the
Guelf and Ghibeline struggle from a rivalry between two German houses to
a partisan warfare which rent Italy for generations I am quite aware
that I have merely touched the surface of the subject which seems to
me to contain in it the essence of all political philosophy with
special features such as could only exist in a country which like
Italy had after giving the law to the civilised world been unable to
consolidate itself into a nation like the other nations of Europe I
have I find even omitted to notice what seem to have been the ruling
aims of at any rate the honest partisans on either side unity that of
the Ghibelines independence that of the Guelfs Nor have I drawn
attention to a remarkable trait in Danteas own character which so far
as I know has never been discussedI mean his apparent disregard of
the alower classesa Except for one or two similes drawn from the
avillanoa and his habits and one or two contemptuous allusions to
aMonna Berta e Ser Martinoa and their like it would seem as if for him
the world consisted of what now would be called athe upper ten
thousanda In an ordinary politician or partisan or even in a mere man
of letters this would not be strange but when we reflect that Dante was
a man who went deeply into social and religious questions that he was
born less than forty years after the death of St Francis and was at
least closely enough associated with Franciscans for legend to make him
a member of the order and that most of the socalled heretical sects of
the timePaterines Cathari Poor Menstarted really more from social
than from religious discontent it is certainly surprising that his
interest in the adim common populationsa should have been so slight
The other object at which I have aimed is the introduction of English
students to the theories which seem to have taken possession of the most
eminent Continental Dante scholars and of which some certainly seem to
be quite as much opposed to common sense and knowledge of human nature
as the conjectures of Troya and Balbo for instance were to sound
historical criticism Here again I have but touched on the more
salient points feeling sure that before long some of the scholarship in
our Universities and elsewhere which at present devotes itself to Greek
and Latin having reached the point of realizing that Greek and Latin
texts may be worth studying though written outside of socalled
classical periods will presently extend the principle to the further
point of applying to mediAval literature which hitherto has been too
much the sport of dilettanti the methods that have till now been
reserved for the two favoured and rightly favoured languages Unless I
am much mistaken the finest Latin scholar will find that a close study
of early Italian will teach him aa thing or twoa that he did not know
before in his own special subject so that his labour will not be lost
even from that point of view Then we shall get the authoritative
edition of Dante which I am insular enough to believe will never come
from either Germany or Italy or from any intervening country

DANTE HIS TIMES AND HIS WORK
CHAPTER I
THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY
The person who sets to work to write about Dante at the present day has
two great difficulties to reckon with the quantity which has already
been written on the subject and the quantity which remains to be
written The first involves the reading of an enormous mass of
literature in several languages and very various in quality but for
the comfort of the young student it may at once and once for all be
stated that he can pretty safely ignore everything written between 1400
and 1800 The subject of commentaries biographies and other helps or
wouldbe helps will be treated of later on Here we need only say that
the Renaissance practically stifled anything like an intelligent study
of Dante for those four centuries and it was not until a new critical
spirit began to apply to it the methods which had hitherto been reserved
for the Greek and Latin classics that the study got any chance of
development How enormously it has developed during the present century
needs not to be said It may suffice to point out that the British
Museum Catalogue shows editions of the Commedia at the rate of one for
every year since 1800 and other works on Dante in probably five times
that proportion
Now it has been said of the Commedia and the remark is equally true
of Danteas other works that it is like the Bible in this respect every
man finds in it what he himself brings to it The poet finds poetry the
philosopher philosophy the scientific man science as it was known in
1300 the politician politics heretics have even found heresy Nor is
this very surprising when we consider what were the authoras
surroundings Naturally no doubt a man of study and contemplation his
lot was cast in the midst of a stirring even a turbulent society
where it was hardly possible for any individual to escape his share of
the public burdens Ablebodied men could not be spared when as was
usually the case fighting was toward all men of mental capacity were
needed in council or in administration And after all the area to be
administered the ground to be fought over were so small that the man
of letters might do his duty by the community and yet have plenty of
time to spare for his studies He might handle his pike at Caprona or
Campaldino one day and be at home among his books the next Then
again the society was a cultivated and quickwitted one with many
interests Arts and letters were in high esteem and eminence in them as
sure a road to fame as warlike prowess or political distinction From
all this it is clear that the Florentine of the thirteenth century had
points of contact with life on every side every gate of knowledge lay
open to him and he could explore if he pleased every one of its
paths They have now been carried further and a lifetime is too short
for one man to investigate thoroughly more than one or two but in those
days it was still possible for a man of keen intelligence added to the
almost incredible diligence as it appears to us of the Middle Ages to
make himself acquainted with all the best that had been done and said
in the world
This it is which forms at once the fascination and the difficulty of
Danteas great work Of course if we content ourselves with reading it
merely for its abeautiesa for the Asthetic enjoyment of an image here
and an allusion there for the trenchant expression of some thought or
feeling at the roots of human nature there will be no need of any
harder study than is involved in going through it with a translation
Indeed it will hardly be worth while to go to the original at all The
pleasure one might almost say the physical pleasure derived from
sonorous juxtaposition of words such as we obtain from Milton or from
Shelley is scarcely to be genuinely felt in the case of a foreign
language and the beauties of matter as distinguished from those of
form are faithfully enough rendered by Cary or Longfellow
It may however be safely assumed that few intelligent students will
rest content with this amount of study They will find at every turn
allusions calling for explanation philosophical doctrines to be traced
to their sources judgements on contemporary persons and events to be
verified On every page they will meet with problems the solution of
which has not yet been attempted or attempted only in the most
perfunctory way For generation after generation readers have gone on
accepting received interpretations which only tell them what their own
wits could divine without any other assistance than the text itself
gives No commentator seems yet to have realised that in order to
understand Dante thoroughly he must put himself on Danteas level so far
as regards a knowledge of all the available literature The more obvious
quarries from which Dante obtained the materials for his mighty
structurethe Bible Virgil Augustine Aquinas Aristotlehave no
doubt been pretty thoroughly examined and many obscurities which the
comments of Landino and others only left more obscure have thus been
cleared up but a great deal remains to be done Look where one may in
the literature which was open to Dante one finds evidence of his
universal reading We take up such a book as Otto of Freisingas Annals
to which with his Acts of Frederick I we shall have to refer
again and find the good bishop moralising thus on the mutability of
human affairs with especial reference to the breakup of the Empire in
the middle of the ninth century
aDoes not worldly honour seem to turn round and round after the
fashion of one stricken with fever For such place their hope of
rest in a change of posture and so when they are in pain
throw themselves from side to side turning over
continuallya1
It is hard not to suppose that Dante had this passage in his mind when
he wrote that bitter apostrophe to his own city with which the sixth
canto of the Purgatory ends
aE se ben ti ricorda e vedi lume
Vedrai te somigliante a quella inferma
Che non puA2 trovar posa in su le piume
Ma con dar volta suo dolore schermaa
It is hardly too much to say that one cannot turn over a couple of pages
of any book which Dante may conceivably have read without coming on some
passage which one feels certain he had read or at the very least
containing some information which one feels certain he possessed A real
aDanteas librarya2 would comprise pretty well every book in Latin
Italian French or ProvenAal apublisheda if we may use the term up
to the year 1300 Of course a good many Latin books were may one say
fortunately in temporary retirement at that time but even of these
whether as has been suggested through volumes now lost of aElegant
Extractsa or by whatever other means more was evidently known than is
always realised
We must however beware of treating Dante merely as a repertory of
curious lore or museum of literary bricA braca danger almost as
great as that of looking at him from a purely Asthetic point of view He
had no doubt read more widely than any man of his age and he is one of
the halfdozen greatest poets of all time But his claim on our
attention rests on even a wider basis than these two qualities would
afford He represents as it were the reopening of the lips of the human
race aWhile I was musing the fire kindled and at last I spake with my
tonguea The old classical literature had said its last word when
Claudian died and though men continued to compose often with ability
and intelligence the histories and chronicles which practically formed
the only nontheological writings of the socalled aDark Agesa letters
in the full sense of the term lay dormant for centuries Not till the
twelfth century was far advanced did any signs of a reawakening appear
Then to use a phrase of Danteas the dead poetry arose and a burst of
song came almost simultaneously from all Western Europe To this period
belong the Minnesingers of Germany the Troubadours of Provence the
unknown authors of the lovely romancepoetical in feeling though cast
chiefly in a prose formAucassin et Nicolete and of several not less
lovely English ballads and lyrics Even the heavy rhymed chronicles
begin to be replaced by romances in which the true poetic fire breaks
out such as the Nibelungen Lied in its definitive form and the
Chronicle of the Cid
In the new poetry two features strike us at once The sentiment of love
between man and woman which with the ancients and even with early
Christian writers scarcely ever rises beyond the level of a sensual
passion3 becomes transfigured into a profound emotion touching the
deepest roots of a manas nature and acting as an incentive to noble
conduct and closely connected with this the influence of external
nature upon the observer begins for the first time to be recognised and
to form a subject for poetical treatment4 Horace has several charming
descriptions of the sights and sounds of spring but they suggest to him
merely that life is short or that he is thirsty and in either case he
cannot do better than have another drink in company with a friend So
with Homer and Virgil External nature and its beauty are often touched
off in two or three lines which once read are never forgotten but it
is always as ornament to a picture not auxiliary to the expression of a
mood You may search classical literature in vain for such passages as
Walther von der Vogelweideas

or the unknown Frenchmanas

or the equally unknown Englishmanas
aBytuene Mershe and Averil

The lutel foul hath hire wyl
On hyre lud to synge
Ich libbe in lovelonginge

Icham in hire baundouna7
But it is hardly necessary to multiply instances By the middle of the
thirteenth century the spring and the nightingales and the flowering
meadows had become a commonplace of amatory and emotional poetry
So far however poetry was exclusively lyrical The average standard of
versifying was higher perhaps than it has ever been before or since
Every man of education seems to have been able to turn a sonnet or ode
Men of religion like St Francis or Brother Jacopone of Todi
statesmen like Frederick II and his confidant Peter de Vineis
professional or official persons like Jacopo the notary of Lentino or
Guido dalle Colonne the judge of Messina fighting men like several of
the Troubadours political intriguers like Bertrand del Bornall have
left verses which for beauty of thought and melody of rhythm have
seldom been matched But the great poem was yet to come which was to
give to the age a voice worthy of its brilliant performance It is not
only in literature that it displays renewed vitality Turn where we
will in every department of human energy it must have been brilliant
beyond any that the world has ever seen It stood between two worlds
but we cannot say of them that they were
aOne dead
The other powerless to be borna
The old monarchy was dying had indeed as Dante regretfully perceived
died before he was born and the trumpetcall of the De Monarchia
wherewith he sought to revive it was addressed to a generation which
had other ideals of government but it had set in a blaze of splendour
and its last wielder Frederick II was not unfitly known as the
Wonder of the World The mediAval Papacy though about to undergo a loss
of prestige which it never retrieved outlived its rival and had
seldom been a greater force in the political world than it was in the
hands of the ambitious and capable Boniface VIII The scholastic
philosophy which had directed the minds of men for many generations
was soon to make way for other forms of reasoning and other modes of
thought but its greatest exponent St Thomas Aquinas was Danteas
contemporary for nine years These examples will serve to show that the
old systems were capable to the very last of producing and influencing
great men
Meantime the new order was showing no lack of power to be born Two of
our countrymen Roger Bacon and somewhat later William of Ockham
sowed each in his own way the seeds which were to bear fruit in the
science and speculation of far distant ages In the arts architecture
reached its highest pitch of splendour and painting was at the outset
of the course which was to culminate more than two hundred years later
in Titian and Raffaelle But in no field did the energy of the
thirteenth century manifest itself as in that of politics With the
collapse of the Empire came the first birth of the anationalitiesa of
modern Europe The process indeed went on at very different rates The
representative constitution of England the centralised government of
France were by the end of the century fairly started on the lines which
they have followed ever since But England had never owned allegiance to
the Emperor while France had pretty well forgotten whence it had got
the name which had replaced that of Gaul In the countries where the
Empire had till recently been an everpresent power Germany and Italy
the work of consolidation went on far less rapidly indeed it has been
reserved for our own age to see it completed With Germany we have here
nothing directly to do but it is allimportant to the right
understanding of Danteas position that we should glance briefly at the
political state of Italy and especially of Tuscany during the latter
half of the thirteenth century By good fortune we have very copious
information on this matter A contemporary and neighbour of Danteas by
name John Villani happened to be at Rome during the great Jubilee of
1300 The sight of the imperial city and all its ancient glories set him
meditating on its history written as he says in a collocation of
names which looks odd to us but was usual enough then aby Virgil by
Sallust and Lucan by Titus Livius Valerius and Paulus Orosiusa and
moved him as an unworthy disciple to do for his native city what they
had done for Rome The result was the most genial and generally
delightful work of history that has been written since Herodotus
Villani who lived till 1348 when the plague carried him off seems to
have been a man of an equable disposition and sober judgement Like
Dante and all the Florentines of that day he belonged to the Guelf
party and unlike his great fellowcitizen he adhered to it
throughout though by no means approving all the actions of its leaders
After the fashion of the time he begins his chronicle with the Tower of
Babel touches on Dardanus Priam and the Trojan war records the
origin of the Tuscan cities and so by easy stages comes down towards
the age in which he lived The earlier portions of course are more
entertaining and suggestive than trustworthy in detail but as he
approaches a time for which he had access to living memory and still
more when he records the events of which he was himself a witness he is
our best authority

CHAPTER II
GUELFS AND GHIBELINES8
Mention was made in the last chapter of the aGuelfa party and this
with its opposite the party of the aGhibelinesa fills the entire field
of Italian politics during Danteas life and indeed for long afterwards
It would be impossible in the space of these pages to follow up all the
tangled threads which have attached themselves to those famous names
but since we may be to use a picturesque phrase of Carlyleas athankful
for any hook whatever on which to hang halfanacre of thrums in fixed
positiona a few of the more prominent points in the early history of
the great conflict shall be noted here
As every one knows the names originally came from Germany and to that
country we must turn for a short time to know their import
About seven miles to the northeast of Stuttgart in what is now the
kingdom of Wurtemberg is a small town called Waiblingen where was once
a stronghold near the borders of Franconia and Suabia or Alemannia
belonging to the Franconian dukes Conrad often called athe Salica
head of that house was raised to the throne of Germany and the Empire
in 1024 His line held the imperial crown for just a century in the
persons of himself and three Henries who are known as the second
third and fourth or third fourth and fifth according as we reckon
their places among Roman Emperors or German Kings Henry III or IV
being famous as the great opponent of Pope Gregory VII Henry IV or
V interesting to us as the first husband of the daughter of Henry I
of England renowned in English history as the Empress Maud The last
Henry died childless in 1125 But the Franconian line was not extinct
Half a century or so before Bishop Otto of Freising tells us aa certain
count by name Frederick sprung from one of the noblest families of
Suabia had founded a colony in a stronghold called Staufena Staufen
better known as Hohenstaufen is a lofty hill about twenty miles from
Waiblingen and within the Suabian frontier Frederick had been staunch
to Henry IV in his time of greatest difficulty and received as his
reward together with the dukedom of Suabia which the house of
ZAhringen had forfeited through disloyalty the hand of the Emperoras
daughter Agnes By her he had two sons Frederick who succeeded to his
own duchy of Suabia and Conrad who received from his uncle Henry V
that of Franconia including no doubt the lordship of Waiblingen At
Henryas death Frederick and Conrad being then thirtyfive and
thirtythree years old respectively were the most powerful princes of
the Empire Henry had designated Frederick as his successor but the
electors thought otherwise At the instance of the Archbishop of Mainz
between whom and the Hohenstaufen there was no love lost and as it
would seem not without pressure from Lewis VI of France whom Henryas
death had just saved from having to face an alliance between England
and Germany they chose Lothar Duke of Saxony
We will now quote Otto of Freising once more aUp to the present timea
he says writing of the year 1152 atwo families have been famous in the
Roman Empire about the parts where Gaul and Germany meet the Henries
of Waiblingen and the Welfs of Altdorfa The Welfs go back to by far
the greater antiquity They probably did not originally belong to the
Bajovarian stock for we read elsewhere that they had alarge possessions
in the parts where Alemannia meets the PyrenAan Mountainsa as Otto
usually designates the Alps west of the Brenner This Altdorf is a
village near Ravensburg in Wurtemberg between Ulm and Friedrichshafen
We first meet with the name in history about the year 820 when the
Emperor Lewis I athe Piousa married as his second wife Judith
adaughter of the most noble Count Welfa Somewhere about the middle of
the tenth century a Rudolf of the race was Count of Bozen His son Welf
took part in the insurrection of the Dukes of Worms and Suabia against
their stepfather Conrad II athe Salica and lost some of his
territories in consequence Bozen passing to Etiko an illegitimate
member of the same house The family must have soon been restored to the
imperial favour for before 1050 Welf III appears as Duke of Bavaria
At his death without issue in 1055 he was succeeded by the son of his
sister who had married Azzo II of Este This Welf IV fought on the
side of Henry IV against the revolted Saxons at the Unstrut but soon
rebelled himself He became for a time the husband of the agreat
Countessa Matilda of Tuscany Through him and his son Henry athe
Blacka the line was maintained and though during the period at which
we have arrived the head of the family for several generations bore the
name of Henry it is usually spoken of as athe house of the Welfsa9
and the name is borne by some member of the family at most times At the
accession of Lothar II the head of the house was Henry surnamed athe
Prouda With him the new emperor at once made close alliance giving him
his daughter Gertrude in marriage Henryas sister Judith was already
married to Frederick of Suabia but he sided with his fatherinlaw and
a struggle began which lasted for ten years and in which the
Hohenstaufen brothers had not entirely the worst of it Conrad was
actually anointed at Monza as King of Italy but in the end through the
intervention of St Bernard peace was made and lasted during the few
remaining months of Lotharas life At his death in 1137 Conrad was
elected His first act was to take the duchy of Bavaria from Henry and
bestow it on Leopold the Marquis of Austria his own halfbrother and
whole brother to Bishop Otto the historian Henry died very soon
leaving a young son afterwards known as Henry athe liona and a
brother Welf who at once took up the quarrel on behalf of his nephew
He beat Leopold but when emboldened by this success he proceeded to
attack the Emperor who was besieging the castle of Weinsberg in
Franconia he suffered a severe defeat At this battle we are told the
cries of the contending sides were aWelfa and aWaiblingena Why the
name of an obscure fortress should have been used as a battlecry for
the mighty house of Hohenstaufen we shall probably never know it may
be that it was a chance selection as the password for the day However
that may be the battlecries of Weinsberg were destined to resound far
into future ages Modified to suit nonTeutonic lips they became famous
throughout the civilised world as the designations of the two parties in
a struggle which divided Italy for centuries and of which the last
vibrations only died down if indeed they have died down in our own
day
Of all factionwars which history records this is the most complicated
the most difficult to analyse into distinct issues The Guelfs have been
considered the Church or Papal party and no doubt there is some truth
in this view Indeed there seems to have been some hereditary tradition
of the kind dating from a much earlier generation long in fact before
the Ghibeline name had been heard of When as we have seen Countess
Matilda of Tuscany the champion of Gregory VII was looking out for a
second husband she fixed upon Welf of Bavaria presumably the adux
Noricoruma who as Bishop Otto tells us ain the war with the Emperor
destroyed the cities of Freising and Augsburga Their union did not last
long for Matilda seems to have been hard to please in the matter of
husbands but the fact of his selection looks as if he had been a
persona grata with the Papal See It is somewhat significant too
that Machiavelli regards the contest between Henry IV and the Papacy as
having been athe seed of the Guelf and Ghibeline races whereby when the
inundation of foreigners ceased Italy was torn with intestine warsa
Yet we may shrewdly suspect that it was not so much any special devotion
to the Church as the thwarted ambition of a powerful house which made
the Welfs to be a thorn in the side first of the Franconian then of the
Suabian Emperors10 At any rate when a representative of the family
in the person of Otto IV at last reached athe dread summit of CAsarean
powera the very Pope whose support had placed him on the throne found
himself within little more than a year under the familiar necessity of
excommunicating the temporal head of Christendom Still in Italy no
doubt the Guelfs politically at any rate held by the Church while the
Ghibelines had the reputation of being as a party at least tainted
with what we should now call materialism It will be remembered that
among the sinners in this kind who occupy the burning tombs within the
walls of the city of Dis Dante places both the Emperor Frederick II
the head of Ghibelinism and Farinata degli Uberti the vigorous leader
of the party in Tuscany while the only Guelf who appears there is one
who probably was a very loose adherent to his own faction
Less justified it would seem is the idea that the Guelfs were
specially the patriotic party in Italy No doubt the Popes at one time
tried to pose as the defenders of Italian liberties against German
tyrants and some modern historians forgetting the mediAval conception
