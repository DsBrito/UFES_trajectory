much as had a dream In these few minutes Nature was at work upon him
He possessed no knowledge but instinct was born within him He knew
this was HIS world that the sun and the warmth were for him and that
the sweet things of the earth were inviting him into his heritage He
puckered up his little brown nose and sniffed the air and the pungency
of everything that was sweet and to be yearned for came to him
And he listened His pointed ears were pricked forward and up to him
came the drone of a wakening earth Even the roots of the grasses must
have been singing in their joy for all through that sunlit valley
there was the low and murmuring music of a country that was at peace
because it was empty of men Everywhere was the rippling sound of
running water and he heard strange sounds that he knew was life the
twittering of a rocksparrow the silvertoned aria of a blackthroated
thrush down in the fen the shrill paean of a gorgeously coloured
Canada jay exploring for a nesting place in a brake of velvety balsam
And then far over his head a screaming cry that made him shiver It
was instinct again that told him in that cry was danger Noozak looked
up and saw the shadow of Upisk the great eagle as it flung itself
between the sun and the earth Neewa saw the shadow and cringed nearer
to his mother
And Noozakso old that she had lost half her teeth so old that her
bones ached on damp and chilly nights and her eyesight was growing
dimwas still not so old that she did not look down with growing
exultation upon what she saw Her mind was travelling beyond the mere
valley in which they had wakened Off there beyond the walls of forest
beyond the farthest lake beyond the river and the plain were the
illimitable spaces which gave her home To her came dully a sound
uncaught by Neewathe almost unintelligible rumble of the great
waterfall It was this and the murmur of a thousand trickles of
running water and the soft wind breathing down in the balsam and
spruce that put the music of spring into the air
At last Noozak heaved a great breath out of her lungs and with a grunt
to Neewa began to lead the way slowly down among the rocks to the foot
of the ridge
In the golden pool of the valley it was even warmer than on the crest
of the ridge Noozak went straight to the edge of the slough Half a
dozen rice birds rose with a whir of wings that made Neewa almost upset
himself Noozak paid no attention to them A loon let out a squawky
protest at Noozaks softfooted appearance and followed it up with a
raucous screech that raised the hair on Neewas spine And Noozak paid
no attention to this Neewa observed these things His eye was on her
and instinct had already winged his legs with the readiness to run if
his mother should give the signal In his funny little head it was
developing very quickly that his mother was a most wonderful creature
She was by all odds the biggest thing alivethat is the biggest that
stood on legs and moved He was confident of this for a space of
perhaps two minutes when they came to the end of the fen And here was
a sudden snort a crashing of bracken the floundering of a huge body
through kneedeep mud and a monstrous bull moose four times as big as
Noozak set off in lively flight Neewas eyes all but popped from his
head And STILL Noozak PAID NO ATTENTION
It was then that Neewa crinkled up his tiny nose and snarled just as
he had snarled at Noozaks ears and hair and at sticks he had worried
in the black cavern A glorious understanding dawned upon him He could
snarl at anything he wanted to snarl at no matter how big For
everything ran away from Noozak his mother
All through this first glorious day Neewa was discovering things and
with each hour it was more and more impressed upon him that his mother
was the unchallenged mistress of all this new and sunlit domain
Noozak was a thoughtful old mother of a bear who had reared fifteen or
eighteen families in her time and she travelled very little this first
day in order that Neewas tender feet might toughen up a bit They
scarcely left the fen except to go into a nearby clump of trees where
Noozak used her claws to shred a spruce that they might get at the
juice and slimy substance just under the bark Neewa liked this dessert
after their feast of roots and bulbs and tried to claw open a tree on
his own account By midafternoon Noozak had eaten until her sides
bulged out and Neewa himselfbetween his mothers milk and the many
odds and ends of other thingslooked like an overfilled pod
Selecting a spot where the declining sun made a warm oven of a great
white rock lazy old Noozak lay down for a nap while Neewa wandering
about in quest of an adventure of his own came face to face with a
ferocious bug
The creature was a giant woodbeetle two inches long Its two battling
pincers were jet black and curved like hooks of iron It was a rich
brown in colour and in the sunlight its metallic armour shone in a
dazzling splendour Neewa squatted flat on his belly eyed it with a
swiftly beating heart The beetle was not more than a foot away and
ADVANCING That was the curious and rather shocking part of it It was
the first living thing he had met with that day that had not run away
As it advanced slowly on its two rows of legs the beetle made a
clicking sound that Neewa heard quite distinctly With the fighting
blood of his father Soominitik nerving him on to the adventure he
thrust out a hesitating paw and instantly Chegawasse the beetle took
upon himself a most ferocious aspect His wings began humming like a
buzzsaw his pincers opened until they could have taken in a mans
finger and he vibrated on his legs until it looked as though he might
be performing some sort of a dance Neewa jerked his paw back and after
a moment or two Chegawasse calmed himself and again began to ADVANCE
Neewa did not know of course that the beetles field of vision ended
about four inches from the end of his nose the situation
consequently was appalling But it was never born in a son of a father
like Soominitik to run from a bug even at nine weeks of age
Desperately he thrust out his paw again and unfortunately for him one
of his tiny claws got a half Nelson on the beetle and held Chegawasse
on his shining back so that he could neither buzz not click A great
exultation swept through Neewa Inch by inch he drew his paw in until
the beetle was within reach of his sharp little teeth Then he smelled
of him
That was Chegawasses opportunity The pincers closed and Noozaks
slumbers were disturbed by a sudden bawl of agony When she raised her
head Neewa was rolling about as if in a fit He was scratching and
snarling and spitting Noozak eyed him speculatively for some moments
then reared herself slowly and went to him With one big paw she rolled
him overand saw Chegawasse firmly and determinedly attached to her
offsprings nose Flattening Neewa on his back so that he could not
move she seized the beetle between her teeth bit slowly until
Chegawasse lost his hold and then swallowed him
From then until dusk Neewa nursed his sore nose A little before dark
Noozak curled herself up against the big rock and Neewa took his
supper Then he made himself a nest in the crook of her big warm
forearm In spite of his smarting nose he was a happy bear and at the
end of his first day he felt very brave and very fearless though he
was but nine weeks old He had come into the world he had looked upon
many things and if he had not conquered he at least had gone
gloriously through the day
CHAPTER TWO
That night Neewa had a hard attack of Mistupuyew or stomachache
Imagine a nursing baby going direct from its mothers breast to a
beefsteak That was what Neewa had done Ordinarily he would not have
begun nibbling at solid foods for at least another month but nature
seemed deliberately at work in a process of intensive education
preparing him for the mighty and unequal struggle which he would have
to put up a little later For hours Neewa moaned and wailed and Noozak
muzzled his bulging little belly with her nose until finally he
vomited and was better
After that he slept When he awoke he was startled by opening his eyes
full into the glare of a great blaze of fire Yesterday he had seen the
sun golden and shimmering and far away But this was the first time he
had seen it come up over the edge of the world on a spring morning in
the Northland It was as red as blood and as he stared it rose
steadily and swiftly until the flat side of it rounded out and it was a
huge ball of SOMETHING At first he thought it was Lifesome monstrous
creature sailing up over the forest toward themand he turned with a
whine of enquiry to his mother Whatever it was Noozak was unafraid
Her big head was turned toward it and she was blinking her eyes in
solemn comfort It was then that Neewa began to feel the pleasing
warmth of the red thing and in spite of his nervousness he began to
purr in the glow of it From red the sun turned swiftly to gold and
the whole valley was transformed once more into a warm and pulsating
glory of life
For two weeks after this first sunrise in Neewas life Noozak remained
near the ridge and the slough Then came the day when Neewa was eleven
weeks old that she turned her nose toward the distant black forests
and began the summers peregrination Neewas feet had lost their
tenderness and he weighed a good six pounds This was pretty good
considering that he had only weighed twelve ounces at birth
From the day when Noozak set off on her wandering TREK Neewas real
adventures began In the dark and mysterious caverns of the forests
there were places where the snow still lay unsoftened by the sun and
for two days Neewa yearned and whined for the sunlit valley They
passed the waterfall where Neewa looked for the first tune on a
rushing torrent of water Deeper and darker and gloomier grew the
forest Noozak was penetrating In this forest Neewa received his first
lessons in hunting Noozak was now well in the bottoms between the
Jacksons Knee and Shamattawa waterway divides a great hunting ground
for bears in the early spring When awake she was tireless in her quest
for food and was constantly digging in the earth or turning over
stones and tearing rotting logs and stumps into pieces The little gray
woodmice were her piece de resistance small as they were and it
amazed Neewa to see how quick his clumsy old mother could be when one
of these little creatures was revealed There were times when Noozak
captured a whole family before they could escape And to these were
added frogs and toads still partly somnambulent many ants curled up
as if dead in the heart of rotting logs and occasional bumblebees
wasps and hornets Now and then Neewa took a nibble at these things
On the third day Noozak uncovered a solid mass of hibernating vinegar
ants as large as a mans two fists and frozen solid Neewa ate a
quantity of these and the sweet vinegary flavour of them was
delicious to his palate
As the days progressed and living things began to crawl out from under
logs and rocks Neewa discovered the thrill and excitement of hunting
on his own account He encountered a second beetle and killed it He
killed his first woodmouse Swiftly there were developing in him the
instincts of Soominitik his scraploving old father who lived three
or four valleys to the north of their own and who never missed an
opportunity to get into a fight At four months of age which was late
in May Neewa was eating many things that would have killed most cubs
of his age and there wasnt a yellow streak in him from the tip of his
saucy little nose to the end of his stubby tail He weighed nine pounds
at this date and was as black as a tarbaby
It was early in June that the exciting event occurred which brought
about the beginning of the big change in Neewas life and it was on a
day so warm and mellow with sunshine that Noozak started in right after
dinner to take her afternoon nap They were out of the lower timber
country now and were in a valley through which a shallow stream
wriggled and twisted around white sandbars and between pebbly shores
Neewa was sleepless He had less desire than ever to waste a glorious
afternoon in napping With his little round eyes he looked out on a
wonderful world and found it calling to him He looked at his mother
and whined Experience told him that she was dead to the world for
hours to come unless he tickled her foot or nipped her ear and then
she would only rouse herself enough to growl at him He was tired of
that He yearned for something more exciting and with his mind
suddenly made up he set off in quest of adventure
In that big world of green and golden colours he was a little black
ball nearly as wide as he was long He went down to the creek and
looked back He could still see his mother Then his feet paddled in
the soft white sand of a long bar that edged the shore and he forgot
Noozak He went to the end of the bar and turned up on the green shore
where the young grass was like velvet under his paws Here he began
turning over small stones for ants He chased a chipmunk that ran a
close and furious race with him for twenty seconds A little later a
huge snowshoe rabbit got up almost under his nose and he chased that
until in a dozen long leaps Wapoos disappeared in a thicket Neewa
wrinkled up his nose and emitted a squeaky snarl Never had
Soominitiks blood run so riotously within him He wanted to get hold
of something For the first time in his life he was yearning for a
scrap He was like a small boy who the day after Christmas has a pair
of boxing gloves and no opponent He sat down and looked about him
querulously still wrinkling his nose and snarling defiantly He had
the whole world beaten He knew that Everything was afraid of his
mother Everything was afraid of HIM It was disgustingthis lack of
something alive for an ambitious young fellow to fight After all the
world was rather tame
He set off at a new angle came around the edge of a huge rock and
suddenly stopped
From behind the other end of the rock protruded a huge hind paw For a
few moments Neewa sat still eyeing it with a growing anticipation
This time he would give his mother a nip that would waken her for good
He would rouse her to the beauty and the opportunities of this day if
there was any rouse in him So he advanced slowly and cautiously
picked out a nice bare spot on the paw and sank his little teeth in it
to the gums
There followed a roar that shook the earth Now it happened that the
paw did not belong to Noozak but was the personal property of Makoos
an old hebear of unlovely disposition and malevolent temper But in
him age had produced a grouchiness that was not at all like the
grandmotherly peculiarities of old Noozak Makoos was on his feet
fairly before Neewa realized that he had made a mistake He was not
only an old bear and a grouchy bear but he was also a hater of cubs
More than once in his day he had committed the crime of cannibalism He
was what the Indian hunter calls uchana bad bear an eater of his own
kind and the instant his enraged eyes caught sight of Neewa he let out
another roar
At that Neewa gathered his fat little legs under his belly and was off
like a shot Never before in his life had he run as he ran now
Instinct told him that at last he had met something which was not
afraid of him and that he was in deadly peril He made no choice of
direction for now that he had made this mistake he had no idea where
he would find his mother He could hear Makoos coming after him and as
he ran he set up a bawling that was filled with a wild and agonizing
prayer for help That cry reached the faithful old Noozak In an
instant she was on her feetand just in time Like a round black ball
shot out of a gun Neewa sped past the rock where she had been sleeping
and ten jumps behind him came Makoos Out of the corner of his eye he
saw his mother but his momentum carried him past her In that moment
Noozak leapt into action As a football player makes a tackle she
rushed out just in time to catch old Makoos with all her weight full
broadside in the ribs and the two old bears rolled over and over in
what to Neewa was an exciting and glorious mixup
He had stopped and his eyes bulged out like shining little onions as
he took in the scene of battle He had longed for a fight but what he
saw now fairly paralyzed him The two bears were at it roaring and
tearing each others hides and throwing up showers of gravel and earth
in their deadly clinch In this first round Noozak had the best of it
She had butted the wind out of Makoos in her first dynamic assault and
now with her dulled and broken teeth at his throat she was lashing him
with her sharp hind claws until the blood streamed from the old
barbarians sides and he bellowed like a choking bull Neewa knew that
it was his pursuer who was getting the worst of it and with a squeaky
cry for his mother to lambast the very devil out of Makoos he ran back
to the edge of the arena his nose crinkled and his teeth gleaming in a
ferocious snarl He danced about excitedly a dozen feet from the
fighters Soominitiks blood filling him with a yearning for the fray
and yet he was afraid
Then something happened that suddenly and totally upset the maddening
joy of his mothers triumph Makoos being a hebear was of necessity
skilled in fighting and all at once he freed himself from Noozaks
jaws wallowed her under him and in turn began ripping the hide off
old Noozaks carcass in such quantities that she let out an agonized
bawling that turned Neewas little heart into stone
It is a matter of most exciting conjecture what a small boy will do
when he sees his father getting licked If there is an axe handy he is
liable to use it The most cataclysmic catastrophe that cam come into
his is to have a father whom some other boys father has given a
walloping Next to being President of the United States the average
small boy treasures the desire to possess a parent who can whip any
other twolegged creature that wears trousers And there were a lot of
human things about Neewa The louder his mother bawled the more
distinctly he felt the shock of his world falling about him If Noozak
had lost a part of her strength in her old age her voice at least was
still unimpaired and such a spasm of outcry as she emitted could have
been heard at least half a mile away
Neewa could stand no more Blind with rage he darted in It was chance
that closed his vicious little jaws on a toe that belonged to Makoos
and his teeth sank into the flesh like two rows of ivory needles
Makoos gave a tug but Neewa held on and bit deeper Then Makoos drew
up his leg and sent it out like a catapault and in spite of his
determination to hang on Neewa found himself sailing wildly through the
air He landed against a rock twenty feet from the fighters with a
force that knocked the wind out of him and for a matter of eight or
ten seconds after that he wobbled dizzily in his efforts to stand up
Then his vision and his senses returned and he gazed on a scene that
brought all the blood pounding back into his body again
Makoos was no longer fighting but was RUNNING AWAYand there was a
decided limp in his gait
Poor old Noozak was standing on her feet facing the retreating enemy
She was panting like a winded calf Her jaws were agape Her tongue
lolled out and blood was dripping in little trickles from her body to
the ground She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled She was
beyond the shadow of a doubt a whipped bear Yet in that glorious
flight of the enemy Neewa saw nothing of Noozaks defeat Their enemy
was RUNNING AWAY Therefore he was whipped And with excited little
squeaks of joy Neewa ran to his mother
CHAPTER THREE
As they stood in the warm sunshine of this first day of June watching
the last of Makoos as he fled across the creek bottom Neewa felt very
much like an old and seasoned warrior instead of a potbellied
roundfaced cub of four months who weighed nine pounds and not four
hundred
It was many minutes after Neewa had sunk his ferocious little teeth
deep into the tenderest part of the old hebears toe before Noozak
could get her wind sufficiently to grunt Her sides were pumping like a
pair of bellows and after Makoos had disappeared beyond the creek
Neewa sat down on his chubby bottom perked his funny ears forward and
eyed his mother with round and glistening eyes that were filled with
uneasy speculation With a wheezing groan Noozak turned and made her
way slowly toward the big rock alongside which she had been sleeping
when Neewas fearful cries for help had awakened her Every bone in her
aged body seemed broken or dislocated She limped and sagged and moaned
as she walked and behind her were left little red trails of blood in
the green grass Makoos had given her a fine pummeling
She lay down gave a final groan and looked at Neewa as if to say
If you hadnt gone off on some deviltry and upset that old vipers
temper this wouldnt have happened And nowlook at ME
A young bear would have rallied quickly from the effects of the battle
but Noozak lay without moving all the rest of that afternoon and the
night that followed And that night was by all odds the finest that
Neewa had ever seen Now that the nights were warm he had come to love
the moon even more than the sun for by birth and instinct he was more
a prowler in darkness than a hunter of the day The moon rose out of
the east in a glory of golden fire The spruce and balsam forests stood
out like islands in a yellow sea of light and the creek shimmered and
quivered like a living thing as it wound its way through the glowing
valley But Neewa had learned his lesson and though the moon and the
stars called to him he hung close to his mother listening to the
carnival of night sound that came to him but never moving away from
her side
With the morning Noozak rose to her feet and with a grunting command
for Neewa to follow she slowly climbed the suncapped ridge She was in
no mood for travel but away back in her head was an unexpressed fear
that villainous old Makoos might return and she knew that another
fight would do her up entirely in which event Makoos would make a
breakfast of Neewa So she urged herself down the other side of the
ridge across a new valley and through a cut that opened like a wide
door into a rolling plain that was made up of meadows and lakes and
great sweeps of spruce and cedar forest For a week Noozak had been
making for a certain creek in this plain and now that the presence of
Makoos threatened behind she kept at her journeying until Neewas
short fat legs could scarcely hold up his body
It was midafternoon when they reached the creek and Neewa was so
exhausted that he had difficulty in climbing the spruce up which his
mother sent him to take a nap Finding a comfortable crotch he quickly
fell asleepwhile Noozak went fishing
The creek was alive with suckers trapped in the shallow pools after
spawning and within an hour she had the shore strewn with them When
Neewa came down out of his cradle just at the edge of dusk it was to
a feast at which Noozak had already stuffed herself until she looked
like a barrel This was his first meal of fish and for a week
thereafter he lived in a paradise of fish He ate them morning noon
and night and when he was too full to eat he rolled in them And
Noozak stuffed herself until it seemed her hide would burst Wherever
they moved they carried with them a fishy smell that grew older day by
day and the older it became the more delicious it was to Neewa and his
mother And Neewa grew like a swelling pod In that week he gained
three pounds He had given up nursing entirely now for Noozakbeing
an old bearhad dried up to a point where she was hopelessly
disappointing
It was early in the evening of the eighth day that Neewa and his mother
lay down in the edge of a grassy knoll to sleep after their days
feasting Noozak was by all odds the happiest old bear in all that part
of the northland Food was no longer a problem for her In the creek
penned up in the pools were unlimited quantities of it and she had
encountered no other bear to challenge her possession of it She looked
ahead to uninterrupted bliss in their happy hunting grounds until
midsummer storms emptied the pools or the berries ripened And Neewa
a happy little gourmand dreamed with her
It was this day just as the sun was setting that a man on his hands
and knees was examining a damp patch of sand five or six miles down the
creek His sleeves were rolled up baring his brown arms halfway to the
shoulders and he wore no hat so that the evening breeze ruffled a
ragged head of blond hair that for a matter of eight or nine months had
been cut with a hunting knife
Close on one side of this individual was a tin pail and on the other
eying him with the keenest interest one of the homeliest and yet one
of the most companionablelooking dog pups ever born of a Mackenzie
hound father and a mother half Airedale and half Spitz
With this tragedy of blood in his veins nothing in the world could have
made the pup anything more than just dog His tailstretched out
straight on the sand was long and lean with a knot at every joint
his paws like an overgrown boys feet looked like small
boxinggloves his head was three sizes too big for his body and
accident had assisted Nature in the perfection of her masterpiece by
robbing him of a half of one of his ears As he watched his master this
half of an ear stood up like a galvanized stub while the othertwice
as longwas perked forward in the deepest and most interested enquiry
Head feet and tail were Mackenzie hound but the ears and his lank
skinny body was a battle royal between Spitz and Airedale At his
present inharmonious stage of development he was the doggiest dogpup
outside the alleys of a big city
For the first time in several minutes his master spoke and Miki
wiggled from stem to stern in appreciation of the fact that it was
directly to him the words were uttered
Its a mother and a cub as sure as youre a week old Miki he said
And if I know anything about bears they were here some time today
He rose to his feet made note of the deepening shadows in the edge of
the timber and filled his pail with water For a few moments the last
rays of the sun lit up his face It was a strong hopeful face In it
was the joy of life And now it was lighted up with a sudden
inspiration and a glow that was not of the forest alone came into his
eyes as he added
Miki Im lugging your homely carcass down to the Girl because youre
an unpolished gem of good nature and beautyand for those two things I
know shell love you She is my sister you know Now if I could only
take that cub along with you
He began to whistle as he turned with his pail of water in the
direction of a thin fringe of balsams a hundred yards away
Close at his heels followed Miki
Challoner who was a newly appointed factor of the Great Hudsons Bay
Company had pitched his camp at tie edge of the lake dose to the mouth
of the creek There was not much to ita battered tent a still more
battered canoe and a small pile of dunnage But in the last glow of
the sunset it would have spoken volumes to a man with an eye trained to
the wear and the turmoil of the forests It was the outfit of a man who
had gone unfearing to the rough edge of the world And now what was
left of it was returning with him To Challoner there was something of
human comradeship in these remnants of things that had gone through the
greater part of a years fight with him The canoe was warped and
battered and patched smoke and storm had blackened his tent until it
was the colour of rusty char and his grub sacks were next to empty
Over a small fire title contents of a pan and a pot were brewing when
he returned with Miki at his heels and close to the heat was a
battered and mended reflector in which a bannock of flour and water was
beginning to brown In one of the pots was coffee in the other a
boiling fish
Miki sat down on his angular haunches so that the odour of the fish
filled his nostrils This he had discovered was the next thing to
eating His eyes as they followed Challoners final preparatory
movements were as bright as garnets and every third or fourth breath
he licked his chops and swallowed hungrily That in fact was why
Miki had got his name He was always hungry and apparently always
empty no matter how much he ate Therefore his name Miki The drum
It was not until they had eaten the fish and the bannock and Challoner
had lighted his pipe that he spoke what was in his mind
Tomorrow Im going after that bear he said
Miki curled up near the dying embers gave his tail a clublike thump
in evidence of the fact that he was listening
Im going to pair you up with the cub and tickle the Girl to death
Miki thumped his tail harder than before
Fine he seemed to say
Just think of it said Challoner looking over Mikis head a thousand
miles away Fourteen monthsand at last were going home Im going
to train you and the cub for that sister of mine Eh wont you like
that You dont know what shes like you homely little devil or you
wouldnt sit there staring at me like a totempole pup And it isnt in
your stupid head to imagine how pretty she is You saw that sunset
tonight Well shes prettier than THAT if she is my sister Got
anything to add to that Miki If not lets say our prayers and go to
bed
Challoner rose and stretched himself His muscles cracked He felt life
surging like a giant within him
And Miki thumping his tail until this moment rose on his overgrown
legs and followed his master into their shelter
It was in the gray light of the early summer dawn when Challoner came
forth again and rekindled the fire Miki followed a few moments later
and his master fastened the end of a worn tentrope around his neck and
tied the rope to a sapling Another rope of similar length Challoner
tied to the corners of a grub sack so that it could be carried over his
shoulder like a game bag With the first roseflush of the sun he was
ready for the trail of Neewa and his mother Miki set up a melancholy
wailing when he found himself left behind and when Challoner looked
back the pup was tugging and somersaulting at the end of his rope like
a jumpingjack For a quarter of a mile up the creek he could hear
Mikis entreating protest
To Challoner the business of the day was not a matter of personal
pleasure nor was it inspired alone by his desire to possess a cub
along with Miki He needed meat and bear pork thus early in the season
would be exceedingly good and above all else he needed a supply of
fat If he bagged this bear time would be saved all the rest of the
way down to civilization
It was eight oclock when he struck the first unmistakably fresh signs
of Noozak and Neewa It was at the point where Noozak had fished four
or five days previously and where they had returned yesterday to feast
on the ripened catch Challoner was elated He was sure that he would
find the pair along the creek and not far distant The wind was in his
favour and he began to advance with greater caution his rifle ready
for the anticipated moment For an hour he travelled steadily and
quietly marking every sound and movement ahead of him and wetting his
finger now and then to see if the wind had shifted After all it was
not so much a matter of human cunning Everything was in Challoners
favour
In a wide flat part of the valley where the creek split itself into a
dozen little channels and the water rippled between sandy bars and
over pebbly shallows Neewa and his mother were nosing about lazily for
a breakfast of crawfish The world had never looked more beautiful to
Neewa The sun made the soft hair on his back fluff up like that of a
purring cat He liked the plash of wet sand under his feet and the
singing gush of water against his legs He liked the sound that was all
about him the breath of the wind the whispers that came out of the
